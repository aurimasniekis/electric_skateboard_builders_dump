Seems like Evolve has announced a mid-end Evolve GT alternative:

Devolve?! ðŸ˜…

Odd move. I get wanting to create a more affordable product, but this is surely a step backwards? Had they brought out a dual drive single motor to cut costs then I would have been impressed. 

On a positive note though it does have a great surf vibe.

....I'd be a little worried about the rear mounted motor with that kick tail too. Why didn't they face it inwards?

The hape of the deck is so ugly :/ Specs (except the weight) are interesting...

i've tried with gullwing sidewinders... The second kingpin just gets in the way of the motor.  Also, the reduced clearance under the deck makes it harder to get a motor under there to begin with. It's really hard/impossible

Love the aesthetics! It's still quite expensive but very looks very promising for new eks8 people
