Hey all.
Been looking around at other boards still. Some impressive figures claimed.
Stary board claim 30% gradient capabilities, Boosted claim 25%, and Evolve claim 25%.
New video popped with comparing Boosted Dual+, with Stary and Bamboo GT.
Interesting outcome considering claims.
Interesting to see one company over-estimating their capabilities, and one under-estimating theirs.

As you would predict... evolve with more voltage on a dual drive wins vs boosted.  And stary's planetary gearing or whatever for their hub motors...still not good enough to compete with belts on torque.

Stary is a single motor 6S. It's definitely not going to have the performance. The comparison is a no brainer. :) I'm actually surprised that the Stary kept up if not surpassed the boosted.

Yeah, I was more interested to see how the Stary went. 
Pretty disappointed after watching it. Thought it would have at least been closer to the boosted.

I have tested Stary and I would say it compares to 5065 single belt drive on 6S so it did well on that test. Starys problem is the lack of traction (single drive and urathane slipping on the motor). Just dont understand why they claim that it could do 30% incline.

I wonder if the Boosted 2 will perform slightly better. very impressed with Evolve, would've been even better with a DIY board comparison

Was the boosted running out of battery?

They probably mean it can do 30% incline unmanned 
LoL
The problem with evolve is those sidewinder trucks they use. Very unstable at speed. 
Did anyone else notice how wobbly it was under that guys feet?

unless those lights on the remote blinks like that for errors/faults, then yeah, looks like it was out of battery.

Looks like Sanjay from boosted and Jeff from evolve are discussing whose board can climb hills better.  @onloop Enertion should have a raptor included in this hill climb comparison that Jeff and Sanjay are taking about.

The Raptor would have no issue eating this hill. In fact it should perform better than GT. I would think. One interesting thing to note is the ability for the board to push as far as possible up the hill. To get the best out if it you need to be at least already at speed which they didnt do in the video, but it does show their capabilities. The GT still didnt make it to the very top. Good effort though for such an incline.

Well they decided they are facing off in Florida since Jeff from evolve and Sanjay from boosted are both going there for Surf expo.  I'm thinking @longhairedboy should take one of this 12s boards there since he's from around that area.  And since they're having a hill climbing competition maybe he can throw a 36T or 38T in there.  He'll be with the two big shots of the E-sk8 industry.

Awesome can't wait. All I got to say is Evolve have never had trouble in backing their claims.

GT would easily flog Stary and BB dual+( no competiotion at all ever!!!!!).................

Interested to see bb2.

to me, Boosted is for getting to point A to point B, maybe enjoy the view, grab a coffee. Evolve is about getting  from point A to point B as fast as possible and effing $hit up why you are at it.

I personally pick BB over Evolve. too old to do anything too crazy these days.

@longhairedboy s boards are custom boards. It would be good to see, but would just embarris them both. He should find out where they are doing it and just rock up beside them to take it on.

Believe @onloop is working on a GT to Raptor vid. That will put those two to rest. @jacobbloy is also getting a BB2, so maybe that could join in.  At the end of the day they are all great boards that serve a specific niche.

For all round movement you cant beat the Raptor. Its easy to carry around in PT and range and speed is good and size isnt excessive.

Hehe. I would pay money to see a full comparo with all the best boards. I agree with @dedbny's statement that they are all great boards in their own right. Let's not also forget that there is much more to an all round great board than being able to get up a hill slightly faster than another. The trucks, wheels, remote, deck shape and material, software, weight, asthetics and reliability are all very important and contribute to the overall experience and enjoyment.

There is no point in any of this but just to visually show how much better xyz board is at eating hills. Everyone can look at specs and see which one will win...needless to say there are many that don't understand electronics well enough to see why x board would be faster than z so to them this would be useful.

Sanjay is an engineer from stanford, yet he seems to not accept that the evolve will do better in hill climbing.  He wants the test done in "controlled" environments.

I believe his concern was that people think the BB can't do 25% grade hills. He wants to debunk that notion that cam about through that video and the previous

I wouldn't want to barge into their sandbox. But it would be kind of fun. lol

A customer emailed me last night about climbing the steepest hill he had doing 27mph.  I wish i knew exactly what the grade was. It was that james kelly build i did using the otang kegals and the evolve kegal insert pulley, an 80mm wheel on a 15/32 ratio on 190kv at 12S. That combo is actually a very very nice balance of torque and top end.

Has anyone made a video of the the Enertion motors  against the Evolve GT in a hill climb? I'm surprised there isn't a comparison video made already since they are both in Australia.

I'd really like to see that. A pike's peak style run between an evolve GT and a Raptor. Evolve would be very disappointed. I may even spend the thousands of dollars on tickets to fly to austrailia to see that disappointment first hand.

Hi Mike. Still out of action, but mobile. If we can find another rider Im more than happy to let my Raptor be used for the test. I can meet up somewhere. I know that @onloop was going to try a test with a GT owner, but I think the family and Enertion commitments have been a distraction as I havent heard any more whats so ever.

I actually think the GT in GT mode would give the Raptor a good run for its money. The GT looks like it has a lower center of gravity, so will start off better from start (Raptors better off on a push than stand still), but then the Raptors torque will chase it down up the hill. Also I must say it really should just be a timed run by the same rider to be a fair comparison. I will always have the slight advantage over you as theres not that much of me.

Be a metre or so in it. If that. Oh and by the way I see yourve out done yourself with the BGT as well. Your fully loaded. [quote="Mickyboy, post:26, topic:8756, full:true"]

I'm happy to do some timed back to back runs on both if you're willing to lend me the Raptor for a day - for the benefit of the community of course! ;)

Nice to see comparisons, but these boards all have their strong points. Evolve has the AT option, Boosted has the flex and Stary is light weight. If you want it all... go DIY!

just found this, The stary board struggled alot, but it's still quite impressive! 
I want to see what dual stary hubs would be able to achieve
