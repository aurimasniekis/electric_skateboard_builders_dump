Hey Guys. Anyone got a good Gates part number for the stock AT belts? I called Gates, and they said they don't have the marked evolve part # in their database, since Evolve has contracted for them. So Evolve has a part # on the belt that can't be easily cross referenced. Makes it possible for them to charge $30 for belts that otherwise retail for ~$7.

Thanks for the info.

I found two options on polybelt.com

250-5m-15 Urethane Steel Timing Belt 50 Tooth 
$13,29
250-5m-15 Rubber Timing Belt 50 Tooth 
$6,58

Which one should we choose?

Isnt the urethane a stronger one? Or you recommend it just because of the price (the rubber one)?

 I had the choice when I bought my belt (not for evolve) and they had urethane and rubber for quite similar price..

Found these on Ebay. $18.10 for 2 shipped, so a couple of bucks cheaper:
