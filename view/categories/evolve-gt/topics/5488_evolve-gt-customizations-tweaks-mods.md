Hello from France.

Could you tell me what is the thickness of the board's nose in mm?

I like to order a protection for when I get my Evolve GT Carbon in August 2016.

Thanks.

I had a quick look in the remote today to see if there was any way to add some weighting to the trigger. Anyone that has used a good quality camera lens or even DJ equipment would know a lot of attention goes into the weight and resistance of moving parts. Surprisingly Evolve have paid very little attention to this in designing their remote.

Unfortunately the trigger does not look to be a simple change (at least for my knowledge of circuit boards). I did test adding some foam into the trigger to give more resistance and it does actually work quite well. But its still not gonna save you if your standing on the board and drop/bump the remote unexpectedly.

After a month I really like the remote. What's your sense now?  I'm a trigger-finger guy (joystick guy not console guy) and it's intuitive to me. Still haven't tried a thumb driven remote so cant be sure I wouldn't  prefer that. Still, it 100% needs a trigger-guard. It is way too easy to catch the trigger and have a UD (unauthorized discharge) with the board. It's only a matter of time before someone launches their board into traffic while adjusting their helmet our something. I've come close a few times. 

Also, I find I use the speedo and battery gauge on the remote quite a bit. Initially I thought it was gimmicky, but I find myself checking speed depending on road conditions, and checking battery drain on hill climbs- it helps you find the drain vs speed sweet spot of throttle for any given hill.

I also do like the remote in many ways. The sensitivity can be a positive and a negative it really just depends on riding style. Your right though it needs a trigger guard or kill switch (perhaps thumb operated if they want to stick with trigger remote). The display info is great as well, build quality not so good (although I haven't dropped mine so this hasn't been an issue yet).

Yeah, agree, I suspect it would last one crash and be up for a new one. Could definitely be more ruggedised. The perfect remote seem like the last frontier across the forum sometimes.

When I first held the GT Remote, I would have thought it wouldn't last one fall as well; however, I have had a few terrible falls, 2 of which the remote got caught underneath my hand when trying to brace myself, and it held up surprisingly well. I thought both times that it was going to be demolished for sure, but it survived both. It suffered some cosmetic damage and the trigger was able to spin completely around but it still worked well. So I was very pleased with the durability of the remote based on the impacts it suffered between a falling 200+ lbs guy and the road. 

Happy/ surprised by the remote durability; however, not happy by the fact that my brakes started randomly giving out which is why I had these falls in the first place. Board has been sent back to Evolve and missing it like crazy :(

It's a bit slow. Gen 2 with 90mm abec s is 8 to 10k quicker. Acceleration is great carves like a dream bit too slow : (

edit - this thing rocks ! Torque is amazing and I gained some extra top end with 90mms. Pulling power is unbelievable!
edit - 97mm running now - really cool board. The 4 different speed modes are handy. Fiance rides this one in eco mode and I've been on the tesseract

Just out of curiosity....would it be possible to"mod"out the GT?  It's modular, so once warranty is over, would there be anyway to upgrade some of the parts, ie motors , controller module etc.  Basically to turn it into a diy project to improve upon in the future when better tech becomes available.  

I know with drones this was somewhat possible.

How many of you have put 3M clear bra or similar on the carbon to protect it?

If not, does the carbon mark easily, is it fragile?

My board should be two weeks away so trying to decide if i should wrap it or not

I also considered it but hearing how much of a hussle it is to put it on nicely i decided to go commando. I've got a bit more than a 100km on my GT and it is still ok. I won't tell you that it doesn t scratch at all but nothing realy bad aisthetically however every time a rock hits the deck from below (and it will happen 100%) I am thinking of the clear bra.

I tried to find a clear wrap solution for my Carbon GT, but I couldn't find a product I thought would work. Instead I just added more grip tape to the edges of the board which I think is a must. The extra grip on the edges has helped a lot and surprised that there wasn't grip take there to begin with.

YES! Wrap it... wiped out last week in street mode, my board flipped over and slid a couple feet. All scratched up on top now... oh well. Should have just gone right through that fckn puddle eh

I also put grip tape on edges, helps riding as well as protecting. Also put nose protector on front, no your wheels do not protect the nose in all cases, I found out the hard way. I never installed the 3m clear bra I got, too lazy I guess lol. I did put carbon fiber vinyl tape on parts of underside that I knew would scrape and looks fine.

Added some grip tap to the edges of the board as well as the blue Evolve wheels. The grip tape on the edges is absolutely necessary in my opinion.

I have mangled the 107mm onto caliber II's in 9mm dual diagonalbut not GT. I have mangled MBS AT 100mm onto GT 9mm & 15mm.  Mangling the 107mm onto GT requires slicing about 5mm of uro off the inside of 107mm to fit into Evolve trucks.  The extreme deep centerset and massive contact patch leaves not enough threaded axle to bolt wheels on with pulley. Not that dedicated to 107mm to modify evolve trucks, so probably will slim down a pair of 107mm's at one point...for science. I understand it is actuallky better to slice uro than cut/saw given the bite back. Anyone with experience there to share?

There was a thread, either here or endless sphere about how to do that. Seems as much as you think other methods work, slicing uro is the best path. Was written by a guy who works with uro daily for his job, and other methods the uro bites and chunks out. Slice is clean fast. Seemed like made sense, no one challenged him like you usually see lol. Look for that thread.

Slicing it how? Just got the wheels. how do i do it? I heard someone talking about using a belt sander.
I have to cut off the whole beveled edge off. I haven't seen any good examples of what I should do

 Is it really worth mangling these 107's  will I appreciate the difference  that it will make? I ride in NYC.  I love the cushy AT wheels but sometimes I think they are too bulky.
Will I notice the difference from the 97mm wheels.

Anybody knows if the battery pack of the Bamboo GT is upgradable? I know one of you guys called Whitepony did it on the older carbon, brand new battery pack and the range went through the roof. Either this or add another pack somewhere as a spare or in parallel to the other one, would that be possible and if yes how?

I'm asking this because my rides are very very long and I love the AT setup but sometimes the range isn't good enough for me so I went back to street and trying to see if I can mod the beast.

I have chosen not to mangle the 107's even though I actually have a used spare set.  You should ride around on the 107s on a non esk8, and see the difference.  There is still quite a difference from the 97s, good and not as good.  I did not have the heart to reduce the 107s lol. I am finishing a new build with 107s in dual diagonal 6374 motors, will be able to compare and see the real esk8 difference then.

I rode a guys older Evolve Bamboo - where he swapped to a small drop Landyachtz deck.  Felt amazing!  The small (1/4-1/2" i'd guess) was perfect for locking in the feet and felt super comfy!  He got the idea after seeing the Carbon as it looks to have a small drop.  

Surprisingly good ride w/ only one motor.  Both of the guys i met at this esk8 meetup were on Evolve - fun to swap boards and try them out!

His board - single motor older Evolve Bamboo (not GT like i originally thought):

The closest i could find quickly and i think this is what he used - Landyachtz 38 switchblade (same length as bamboo):

He is just genius lol :D but it turns out someone had sent him in such solution.. I assume accidental trigger touching on evolve is a common thing-- should install some diy made ''dead man's'' switches-  switches, which you have to hold, before any trigger action can be activated.

Mine is still going after 12 months. It did break though. The micro USB port developed a break in the solder and charging became intermittent. I had to hand solder it back together, which is a challenge because the legs/ pads are very fine and very close together. Not sure if the break developed from a drop (I dropped it once, never crashed) or just from normal charging placing stress on the join.

Guys I learned something today

When Evolve said they use those garbage cells because of safety, they were actually correct.

I was riding my 10s4p swapped BGT today and rode it for like 5.5 miles at full throttle in GT mode. Then it suddenly cut out and threw me off when I tried to accelerate from around 12mph.

Pretty sure  it overheated. And this is where the safety aspect comes in. With the voltage sag in a standard battery I could have never ever ridden as fast for as long, so it wouldn't have overheated.

Safety!
