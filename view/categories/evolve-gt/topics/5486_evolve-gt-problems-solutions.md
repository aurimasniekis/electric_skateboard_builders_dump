Despite what the instructional videos say, re-apply blue loctite (medium) to motor mount screws every time you break the thread seal to change wheels/ pulleys/ belts.  Rough ground will eventually work out the screws if you rely on loctite residue.

If releasing your grip on the remote, switch off the remote first. The trigger is exposed and is highly sensitive. High risk it'll catch on something (arm/ leg) while swinging from the lanyard loop, which will launch your board. Switching off the remote briefly won't re-set the trip meter.

I went away for a weekend trip with my board but forgot the charger! Is it a standard port and will it be safe with non-official chargers or should I just not charge it at all?

So I'm swapping my street setup to AT, I put everything on correctly from the 2 washers, then the gear, then 4 speed rings, then the wheel with bearings and spacer inside, and then a outer speed ring and then the nut to lock it all up. I had the belt covers on but after tightening everything, the wheels would literally drag on the side of the belt covers so I took them off and the wheels work fine.
1) Are belt covers actually neccessary?
2) Anyone have any clue what piece I might not be putting on loosly that would cause the wheel to be not far enough out on the axle to leave some clearance between the wheel and the belt cover?
(Yes I'm using the right belt cover lol the small one for AT)

Just leave the covers off. There's no real point to them and can damage your belts if a rock gets stuck inside them.

**Evolve GT Maintenance Issue**

I had one of the drive wheels make a clicking noise as I shifted from accelerating to braking.  Diagnosis is a loose set screw for the drive gear on the motor.  If you have this issue, you will need a 1.5mm allen wrench to remove it, apply thread locker, and reassemble it.

Whats the issue with the overheating of the battery on GT mode. Goes into shut down mode and then cant use it for another 10min while it cools down after vigerous shredding for 10mins. Thats not fun and a design limitation.

I've never had it on road wheels, no matter how hard I push it. I think it's happening on AT wheels on grass- the post I read on it said hard carving on grass for 10 mins (I still haven't used AT). I guess this depends on your view of design fault. AT wheels have a larger mass and grass has high rolling resistance; people are pushing the current high enough for long enough to induce heating. If you ride your raptor up a massive incline for 10 mins and your VESC overheats, is it a design flaw or a design limitation? I'd say what you are referring to is a design limitation. Having said that, if you read onloops discussion with Chaka about motor size, I'd be inclined to think that hard carving on grass with AT wheels for more than 10 mins warrants larger motors. Again though- it's a design limitation not a flaw.

I've been riding AT setup heaps lately, noticed after doing grass hills for a bit the motors heat up a bit. Haven't had any issues with battery oveheat.

Today I went for about 20km on ATs. On bike path but was busy so a fair bit of grass. When I got in town I surfed some massive grass hills for bout 10min. Then Back home. Like any electric motor the more strain you put on it the more it heats. I ride GTmode 100% unless getting flat and haven't had any issues with the electrics or drop outs.

I'm constantly amazed at how this thing handles offroad at high speed. Grass hills. dirty, gravel and hills. Eats em all up.

P.s. ( I'd rather it shut down for 10min than fry all the electrics of my $2000 sk8, doesn't sound like a flaw to me.)

Would have to be a hard 10min though. I push pretty hard.(last night i carried a case of beer a couple of kms. Up hills. No worries Lol)

I just put 8in ATs on and found the wheel rubbing on belt cover. I put 3 spacers on before drive bearing which seemed better.

Now I've got a noise on 1 side every revolution. I changed sides and noise changes over. I can't figure out what it is?
Causes some vibration at higher speed.
Any Ideas?

I'd like to know how that happened. Looks like more than just road vibration! (sometimes just random manufacturer fault)

I ride on and offroad all the time at bout 40kmh.

Evolve are pretty good with warranty, if it just snapped then it's still within warranty and they will replace.

Hi

Hope someone out there can help!!

I've just received my carbon GT and I get really bad vibration sound when I'm carving. Its definitely coming from the front but I cant figure out what is causing it. I've tightened/loosened the trucks, greased the bearings, bushes and even stuffed tissue between the wheels to see if the valve maybe hitting the wheel. No luck so far.
Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. I've made a video but cant upload on this site :disappointed:

Thanks in advance.

Hi Jinra

I've greased the bearings. When I take the front wheel off the spacer is slightly loose inside and I have to give it a slight shake or use my finger to line it up so I can slide it back onto the trucks. I presume this is normal?

Thanks

Hi Jinra

Really appreciate your help. I've left work now so will take some pics when I get back. Not too sure if it would help to be honest. 
For the front wheels, is it speed ring, wheel, speed ring and then nut? My first speed ring is like its part of the truck as I tried to flick it off with a knife but no luck.

Hm that's weird, the speed ring, or washer, should be free floating be able to come off the truck. Maybe it's deformed and got stuck to the truck and is rubbing against the bearing shield. I'd try to get it off and replace it.

The order should be (Speed ring, bearing, spacer, bearing, speed ring, axle nut) in terms of what goes on the axle.

Hi, 
Yesterday i was swaping my gt from AT to street for the first time and noticed the exact same thing on my front left wheel. The speed ring is stuck on the truck and can't get it off. That is not the same case on any other of the wheels though. 
@bornagainskater , it may sound stupid but why don t you open the cover to check if there is something loose in there?

Mate ... Take the front truck entirely off...

Look where the base plate is touching the board...look for cracks inside ....  You can use books to elevate the front end where the trucks would go...have someone light stand on it and lightly bounce  and check (use a flash light) and listen

Edit: the sound in the video sounds like a small crack resonating from the board...sounds like it's only one side ... Does it make a sound more or less if you turn left or right

I had a manufacturing defect with one of the grip-plate screws on my Evolve Carbon GT. The hole tapped for the screw was too big, it had either been tapped with the wrong size or the screw somehow pulled and stripped some of the internal threading. Here is a video of what the problem looked like:
https://goo.gl/photos/yjUjvEEx6NpgaxMY9

The only way to fix this permanently is to either re-tap the hole to a bigger size (The standard screws are M4x12mm countersunk hex bolts) and stick a bigger screw (ie. M5) into it, or attempt to repair the threading with something like a heli-coil kit. Because this was a manufacturing defect I could have sent it back to Evolve to have it fixed but their store is over an hour drive from me and I don't own a car; alternatively it's $20 each way to courier my board to them and have it returned, so $40 minimum to get them to fix it. So I did what any poor person does and try to fix it myself.

I firstly tried purchasing a M5x12mm bolt to see if that would fit - I couldn't get it to tighten down very far because these bolts have a different thread pitch than their smaller cousins and are significantly fatter. So the next thing I tried was to cut half of the thread off that bolt and try again - still no go. The threading pitch is just too different. I looked into getting a heli-coil repair done but was told that in order to get the basic heli-coil kit and some thread inserts would be at least $80+. To get a professional to fix it starts at $88. So the next most viable option is to buy a 5mm hand-tap kit and re-tap the hole to 5mm at a cost of about $11, but I wasn't too excited about having an odd-sized bolt on the board. So in a last ditch attempt to make the M4 bolt hold it down while still being able to remove it for maintenance later, I took a section of plastic drinking straw the length of the bolt thread and cut a section out of it so that the curled section matched the internal diameter of the thread and dropped the straw into the screw hole. I then screwed the original M4 screw into the hole with the straw as a shim around the outside which massively improved the fit and so far is holding the bolt in place. A fix for free!

As an aside - it is well worth checking that your grip-panel is being held securely onto your board if you have a carbon deck, because if it isn't, all sorts of dust/dirt/stones and WATER will get inside, and the molded cavity in there that holds circuit boards, wires and batteries doesn't have any drainage holes, so if it starts taking in water or a spilled can of coke, it will wreck the electronics and make for a very expensive repair. 

Here's what the board looks like with the hood off! Because I had that loose screw for a few weeks, the electronics bay had dust and little stones in it which I vacuumed out. Glad I got curious and took it apart before something more serious happened.

Evolve could have used Panasonic cells but then the price would be higher. They have to keep costs down to compete with all the new companies.

Tesla basically owns the market at this time. Tesla probably use Panasonic because they are big enough to supply them with enough product.

Not because Tesla is big. Panasonic is big enough to supply tesla. They make heaps of cars, need heaps of batteries.

Not really the point of this forum though.

The point is I haven't heard heaps of people having problems with GT batteries.
Mine still holds charge well. Board still goes hard as advertised.

the wattage limit is because they don't discriminate between lipo packs and li-ion cylindrical cells. I've seen a lot of lipo packs explode or catch fire, but rarely see anything for 18650's. Technically though people bring lipo packs hundreds of thousands of times per day through laptops, phones, etc and they rarely cause issues. Maybe someone can get a specific set of rules made for cylindrical cells or packs with a built in protection system such as cell level fusing or cell vents.

Sounds like problem #1 is a symptom of problem #2. If you're getting connection dropouts while you're on the board or within a couple of meters of it, there's something up with the remote. If you can reproduce the problem reliably, take it back for Evolve to have a look at, because that's definitely not normal.

Sounds like you are experiencing the same issues that I have been experiencing and am still experiencing after getting it back from Evolve. My board seems to randomly, but consistently shut off after just a short amount of riding. I sent it back, and they "couldn't recreate the issue." However they said they replaced all the electronics and relocated the heat sensor. Upon getting it back, it seems to be worse than before I sent it. I have sustained injuries and my stuff has sustained damage due to the board cutting out on me. They act like they have no idea what is going on or how to fix it, but I will be sending it back in again. So you ultimately requested a refund? Or do you think there is a fix or just a critical product flaw?

I am experiencing the same issues even after sending it back to Evolve. A board that randomly shuts down with no consistency or warning is unacceptable to me and extremely dangerous especially since I live and ride in an urban environment. Hope they figure this out asap!

Hello everyone... great forum. Got my gt second wave and have been ridin every chance i get... very happy with it... 
Bornagainskater, any luck with your board man?  I'm getting a similar noise. Doesn't fckn sound good and very tough to locate. Secondly, anyone else find the 97mm street wheels to be noisy? Is that the spacer rattling in there? Thanks.

What bearings do you use on street/AT? And if you're having the clicking issue on AT lube the wheel where the bearings sit with white lithium grease.

Welcome!  Sounds like things are well except for noise issues. I have tried the GT with a lot if wheels and wheel sizes. The street 97mm is no different for me, are you talking about the ABEC 11 or clones?  Best way to check is swap out bearings on side with most noise. Maybe bearings with built in spacers so takes the spacer fit rattle out if equation. Refitting and swapping around the existing bearings changes noise sometimes. Or service the bearings if they are not new, or switch to or borrow a pair of ceramics and see difference. Some combo of problem solving like this should diagnose the noise, as it is not normal experience for 97mm street wheels imo

Thanks for the replys... still using original bearings, but noise was there from the get go... board rolled smoothly though... and streed mode is so awesome I just put on my ear buds and ripped! Going to first try cleaning/lube, then will try new bearings.... keep you posted. Would still like to hear from bornagainskater though.... Thanks again

I understand that BoardsportRN is upset by his bad experience, but seems like there is also a lot of people that do enjoy their boards.  

He is correct that the person in the video is a evolve ambassador.  I only posted the video to possibly assist people find a solution to their problem.  The negativity is a little heavy bud.  If it works to help one person enjoy their board or ride...what's it matter who posts the video.  I would look at the video a little more glass half full, as in they are giving tips and tricks on how to repair and maintain.

Maybe they dont want to admit the shut off issue as they dont have that easy fix and like you have more returns. It would cost them alot if alot more GTs were returned. But not all are pushing it that hard that they are getting shut off from the sounds of it.

I think there are alot more GT owners that are satisfied with their purchase.

Every board experiences voltage sag on some level. The GT tends to sag a lot due to the massive acceleration/high current draw on it. It's not abnormal for the GT to sag, but it's not as healthy for the cell life for it to sag so much. That said the pack is rated for 80a continuous draw, which the GT draws that or less by my guess. The big problem lies with the heat generated by the cells which decay life as well. 

My GT never really got hot and I had no electronic issues with mine whatsoever. I did have my board crack for no reason, but my electronics were solid.

it's a 4p 10ah pack, so most likely 80a continuous, though it's possible it's less. Like i said, the larger sag is due to the heavy acceleration, not just uphill performance. This is how the GT pays for increased performance. I also wouldn't really trust the GT battery meter and just get a direct reading from the terminals as they set up their meter with a bias.

I'm not saying the GT is a great board without faults, I'm actually kind of agreeing with you on this. I'm just saying my board was fine, with no electronics problems

Not defending...  I totally agree.  If there is issues, they must be addressed.  But also doing my homework searching around, there is plenty of people who are also quite happy with the board.  I'm still waiting for mine to arrive.   As I discussed with @BoardSportsRN, I live in one the flattest of places around.  No hills for easily 150+ kms.  He explained to me the issues and concerns regarding the voltage sag.  I had no idea before.  So for people in my similar riding situation (Netherland, Denmark, Northern Germany), Voltage sag is likely not going to be a major issue.  Not saying it won't happen, but 20 meters is declared a hill here....just saying all riders have different criteria for what they are looking for.  

I am more concerned with remote cut outs personally.   Some of us don't have the knowledge/time to do our own build and the best available option in Europe for off the shelf boards, I personally think is Evolve (distributors located locally instead of state side or Australia) ... as Mellow is still a bit off from deliveries..... for now.

Just saying were not all in the same boat when it comes to options.  Something that needs to be considered for us international (EU) customers.

I'm only trying to find out what peoples issues are and doing as much learning as I can.  Just sharing the very little knowledge I have with others that may be newbies as well and are excited to get their board.

No doubt, with what people have posted...I will be going into my experience paying much closer attention to detail rather than being blindly excited by the new wheels.

Is there not some sort of a tiny low voltage meter we could put in there to at least give you a half second warning? I had a little one for my drone.    Don't know how much space there is to work with.  I know ....WE shouldn't have to find solutions .  Just asking as I have no idea

Hey I agree with you that @BoardSportsRN should probably tone it back a bit, but I do think he is right about what he is saying about Evolve. My CGT is currently back at Evolve for the second time due to the board randomly shutting down while riding. Also let me be very clear. You do not have to be riding on hills or off road for this shut down to happen. (I wish this was the case because I then could at least know when to anticipate it.) Even after my board was "fixed" and returned to me the first time, I went on a very short ride (less than a mile) on a completely flat road to go get my car, and the board shut down on me before I made it to my destination. Not to mention I was only going about 5mph the whole time literally because I was scared and knew I had to send it back again. So my "fixed" board has to be "fixed" again. I have had my board a total of 4 days. Got it suffered some pretty serious injuries from the board shutting down on me, sent it in to have it "fixed", got it back rode 2 days, ripped some pants and some road rash, and now its getting "fixed" again. I absolutely LOVE my CGT when it works, but a board that shuts down randomly is far too dangerous for me. I hope that Evolve figures it out.

Agreed.  I'm hoping that when the board is more readily available for the masses, we can find someone with the know how to help sort out these things.  
Evolve needs to get on top of this.  Perhaps if we get enough people together or lodge a mass complaint we can get some sort of an answer.  Sucks to hear about your crashes bud...and being without your board also is a bummer.  Glad to hear your Ok.

Keep us posted on if it persists when you get it back.

Even though you are probably right, you sound like crying two year old rather than someone who knows what they are talking about. I know you are trying to get your message out there, but people are just going to ignore you rather than listen to what you have to say. Also as someone who says they are starting a board company, you are doing a good job of alienating your potential customers. I respect your knowledge and thoughts; however, I think everyone would appreciate it if you were a little more constructive in your posts. 

See if you can respond constructively without insults and unnecessary negativity towards Evolve.

Hi folks,

For longer periods of not being used, what should the battery be stored at? Percentage and voltage wise?

I read mixed answers before for lithium batteries, from people saying 50% to people saying keep it stored at 100%.

I suppose we'd all want our batteries stored in a way that would best preserve longevity and also for safety (avoiding puffing etc.).

Thoughts?

Store at 40-50% or nominal voltage 3.6-3.7v. Anywhere that says to store at 100 or 0% is wrong. batteries are happiest in the middle of the road.

Got another question that I'm putting out there.

Is there blue LED on the remote supposed to light up when in-use with the board? I've noticed photos of people's remotes, and the blue LED is on.

For mine, it only comes on when I've got it plugged into the USB and it's fully charged up.

Hey all new here sorry if I'm posting wrong or anything.

My Evolve GT Bamboo came today and after a full charge I took it out to my drive way and when I was pressed the power button a puff of smoke came out and no lights on board. Remote seems to be working fine, won't sync, board seems dead and I didn't even get to ride it once.

Are my only options to return it?

Pretty bummed out already got the board late and now waiting for a replacement is really going to kill my time to ride before it gets too cold.

Which distributor are you dealing with? I wouldn't expect a new board, but rather them to fix / attempt to fix the original one. My board Carbon GT malfunctioned on day two basically my first real ride, and I had to send it back to Evolve. It is now at Evolve for a second time after it came back worse than before. I received my board on Aug. 8 and have had it a total of 4 days. The rest of the time it has either been in transit or at Evolve. 
I am sorry to hear you are having issues and hope for a quick resolution. 
I will say the Evolve USA has been really responsive despite not having a resolution yet.

Hi everyone! 

I bought the bamboo gt and I got a defective one. The board shut down by itself randomly and it's not a overheat problem for sure. But I saw that the regenerative bracking can shut down the board if the board is full charge to protect the battery of overcharging. In my case I'm pretty sure it's not the case but I would like your opinion about that because I think it's weird to shut down the board when you use brake, in my point of view brake is a really important safety feature on that kind of product! Do you know if a DIY board have this issue? 

Thanks
(Sorry for the bad english It's second language)

Did the board shut down or did the remote disconnect? If the board shut down you would have to toggle the power button to reconnect. Also you may have to wait a few minutes for it to "cool down" when toggling to reconnect. 
Were you close to 100% charge? 
What setup were you using? AT or Street?

I had a similar problem where my Carbon GT would randomly shut down while riding primarily triggered by braking but happened in all scenarios. Eventually I was able to get it repaired and has been working great for the last 2 weeks. 

DIY can have every problem a finished board will have and then some.

Hi thanks for your answer! 

The board shut down the remote still on
It's not an overheat problem because it was a short ride in ecco mode and no hill.
The battery was around 90%
I was on the at setup

I'm happy to heard that they fix your, I had a realy good costumer service but I am worried about they don't find the problem and send it back with the same problem. This board is for my girlfriend and I am scared because she's not very good in skateboard. I hope my carbon gt will work well!

Yeah that is the exact same problem I was having where the board would shut down and definitely was not due to pushing the board too hard. Mine also always happened in the AT setup. 

Mine did come back with the same problem the first time, and I had to send it back again. Hopefully they will fix your right the first time! The good news is you can get it fixed.

Any word?

I am following this with great interest - it seems like I should wait for Evolved to iron out their build quality issues before I order.

That looks like the buck converter burnt out.  Makes sense too, taking 42V at continuous discharge of 80Amps (more or less if defective BMS, also based on my readings here) and outputting anywhere from 3-12V would result in a ton of heat buildup.  Might solve it by adding a precharge mechanism to absorb the initial discharge (bigger caps?).

They're using the STM32F4 series it looks like, but not using a gate drivers I recognize.  The VESC for comparison powers itself from the on board buck converter (like above) but could also get its power from the DRV8301 series gate driver (currently floating).

I would be interested in seeing if the VESC would be more compact and reliable if the main supply to the STM32 came from the gate driver. 

If you've got a moment, I would love to inspect the board and see if I can give a repair write up for people looking for out of warranty repair solutions.

Yup just last week I got my board too and after the first initial charge I heard a pop sound after turning my board on... must be a defective shipment of boards.. really feel like the materials used for construction are in question here. 

They've kindly offered to pay for my shipping return costs for the defective board to be repaired. I was contemplating asking for a new product since I payed for it new however I'm just going to accept for a repaired defective board... I still trust in their support and consumer care... Just worried about a board riddled with bugs. If you think otherwise let me know

Sounds like you're handling it like a champ. 

Before you send it off, could you take some well lit photos of the PCB (esp. of the burned areas).  I suspect that Evolve is the victim of counterfeit buck converters (LM25xxxx series). The burnt package is a DDPACK/TO-263 and given its proximity to the coil, it should be the buck converter IC. Its a pretty easy repair assuming that is the only fault in the system. As bizarre as that sounds, fake converters are a real epidemic. 

@thewrapelement You are in possession of two PCBs if I've read your posts correctly. I would gladly pay shipping and a tip to so that I can inspect and attempt a DIY repair. If the bucks are counterfeit, Evolved is going to have a bad time with nonstop repairs.  The VESC's use of the TI-DRV83xx chips could be a huge plus in situations like this since they have their own, internal buck converters.

Yup... exactly right. She just needed a little lube is all.. well alot a lube actually. And thanks bornagainskater. Terrible sound that was. Just wanna say to those who are getting defective boards my heart goes out you all. 
Yesterday ... one of the motors of my board stopped working. After something like 1500-2000km of awesome. In normal conditions.street mode.Yes I ride alot. 500km of bike paths here in montreal. Anyways, jumped off my board right away turned off board. Noticed burning smell near control board area and one of the two wheels wasnt turning properly. Was stiffer. Notchier. Worrisome eh? So contacted evolve they suspect motor controller theyre sending me new one to swap. 
I'm thinking motor controller replacement will solve burnt part on control board but this stiff-ass wheel still worries me. Seeing as I have put so much mileage on this board I think i will be classifying this one as wear and tear and I am satisfied with how they are handling this. May still get a ride in before snow. Keep you posted

Just cut out on me heading down a hill literally, a few days after getting it back from Evolve, in fact it happened on the first ride since getting it out of the box (and putting the front wheel back the right way after someone at Evolve stuck it on the wrong way, which if fine if you want to inflate your tyre from the inside, i guess lol.

Smashed into the back of unsuspecting Land Cruiser to save myself from getting smushed at an intersection in Balmain.

The board is only a few weeks old, motor failed on the 5th short trip.

Have requested a refund, i love the look of the board with its awesome AT tires but i'd rather be alive with no Carbon GT than end up goo on the road.

[quote="asuras, post:44, topic:5486, full:true"]
I had a manufacturing defect with one of the grip-plate screws on my Evolve Carbon GT. The hole tapped for the screw was too big, it had either been tapped with the wrong size or the screw somehow pulled and stripped some of the internal threading. Here is a video of what the problem looked like:
https://goo.gl/photos/yjUjvEEx6NpgaxMY9

The only way to fix this permanently is to either re-tap the hole to a bigger size (The standard screws are M4x12mm countersunk hex bolts) and stick a bigger screw (ie. M5) into it, or attempt to repair the threading with something like a heli-coil kit. Because this was a manufacturing defect I could have sent it back to Evolve to have it fixed but their store is over an hour drive from me and I don't own a car; alternatively it's $20 each way to courier my board to them and have it returned, so $40 minimum to get them to fix it. So I did what any poor person does and try to fix it myself.

I firstly tried purchasing a M5x12mm bolt to see if that would fit - I couldn't get it to tighten down very far because these bolts have a different thread pitch than their smaller cousins and are significantly fatter. So the next thing I tried was to cut half of the thread off that bolt and try again - still no go. The threading pitch is just too different. I looked into getting a heli-coil repair done but was told that in order to get the basic heli-coil kit and some thread inserts would be at least $80+. To get a professional to fix it starts at $88. So the next most viable option is to buy a 5mm hand-tap kit and re-tap the hole to 5mm at a cost of about $11, but I wasn't too excited about having an odd-sized bolt on the board. So in a last ditch attempt to make the M4 bolt hold it down while still being able to remove it for maintenance later, I took a section of plastic drinking straw the length of the bolt thread and cut a section out of it so that the curled section matched the internal diameter of the thread and dropped the straw into the screw hole. I then screwed the original M4 screw into the hole with the straw as a shim around the outside which massively improved the fit and so far is holding the bolt in place. A fix for free!

As an aside - it is well worth checking that your grip-panel is being held securely onto your board if you have a carbon deck, because if it isn't, all sorts of dust/dirt/stones and WATER will get inside, and the molded cavity in there that holds circuit boards, wires and batteries doesn't have any drainage holes, so if it starts taking in water or a spilled can of coke, it will wreck the electronics and make for a very expensive repair. 

Here's what the board looks like with the hood off! Because I had that loose screw for a few weeks, the electronics bay had dust and little stones in it which I vacuumed out. Glad I got curious and took it apart before something more serious happened.

[/quote]

Has the fix stayed in place? I have the same issue, will try it. Do you know if the threads are just into the carbon fibre or is there a metal insert or something like that in there?

My Carbon GT arrived after a wait of almost 2 months and what a bummer :-(

I just received my Carbon GT and I am so disappointed the remote won't do anything, it is stuck with the screen light on and nothing on the screen other than the white light :-( I have attached a photo. I wish those guys checked everything before shipping out. I waited so long I am not sure I want to wait and ship it back for a fix. I charged it and still nothing on the screen other than the white light.

Removing the 4 screws on the back of the remote so that I can open it is just impossible, I tried unscrewing a couple of screws and they just strip and won't turn so that even isn't an option :-( and yes I have the right tools to remove the screws and used the proper screw driver but they are in there so tight that there is no possible way, I managed to remove only 1 screw out of the 4 so I gave up :-(

Just an unhappy customer after such a long wait the least these guys could have done was test it before shipping :-(

Anyone else had this issue? Is there a fix for it? Any info appreciated

"Hi Chris,

From the one time we saw it happen, the customer informed us it took 24-48 hours at the most to die, then he charged up with no issue. Hopefully its the same !

Just let us know if otherwise.

Thank you kindly,
Brandon"

So let it die then re-charge it & voila you should be good to go.

After a long wait to get my remote to work again I made my first ride in the day & then my 1st ride at night links below.

This is the Evolve Carbon GT that I just received and took it out on my 1st ride and used a Sony FDR-X3000 to shoot it in 4K which also sports a built in BOSS (balance optical steady shot) which is 10X better than any other camera with optical stabilization period. The Carbon GT Electric Longboard is really something, a true winner imo. It is not cheap either, the cost of this board which is really a 2 in 1 due to the ability to switch from street wheels to the all terrain wheels, is north of $2200USD and I bought it because I liked the looks of it but also to put it through some testing against our Hoverfly longboard that we manufacture at less than half the cost with the same 3000W of power and Carbon Fiber as well, you can see it at www.hoverflylongboard.com and at www.hidefdepot.com but I am waiting for our version 2.0 to arrive before doing any tests.

The comfort of the all terrain wheels is something to behold. You can ride just about wherever you want and never have to worry about a rough ride. The max speed I got with the AT wheels was 34km/h and the total distance on my first charge with these wheels was 15.9km and I weigh 215lbs. I have the street wheels as well which I have yet to try the Evolve GT 83mm wheels and I also bought the Abec 11 97mm Flywheels to boot which are the wheels they claim will propel me to 43km/h with a total distance of 50km but I have yet to try any of the street wheels yet as this was my 1st day out with the board and it was Presidential Election night & I want to congratulate President Trump! 

Here is my 1st ride with this board daytime video

I received my Bamboo Gt 2 in 1 and ran it yesterday. Took 2-3 hours to charge. Came with the AT wheels installed, remote paired & set to wheel/gear size for the odometer/speedometer. I like everything about it better the my boosted, with the possible exception of the remote. Even after cutting the index finger of my glove down for direct feel, it's a little abrupt/sensitive. I'm sure I'll adjust to it. The GT turns/carves much better than the Boosted (I'm 210 lbs and can't turn the BB around on a 2 lane street). The GT is more maneuverable around corners, and the AT wheels are awesome-great traction and very comfortable compared the the BB wheels. The reduction in shock and vibration provides much more traction and confidence. To me, the option to use different wheels is huge. Range is miles better than the BB with standard battery. So far, I'm considering selling the BB. Will test further before final decision.

Second day now with my Carbon GT and one of the motors is dead :-( this has been very frustrating to say the least after such a long wait I had issues with my remote first which is now fixed and now one of the motors is not spinning. I changed from AT to street & the motor suddenly stopped :frowning: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/e/2e34f68a0f22e1c2f2f20fd9e38d96163a8cbfff.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I tried calling Evolve's USA landline but it keeps going to an answering machine, I left a message & emailed them too I guess this will have to go back darn what an experience. Not so sure I even want it now I will ask for a refund I've read now even more reviews online and people are having all sorts of issues too so it's not just me.

Sorry to hear that, HDD. Question: Is it normal for the board to drop down to ECO from GT when the battery gets low? Can't find anything in the manual, or online, that addresses this. I did just call Evolve USA, and also had to leave a message. Hopefully they are busy with orders, and not evolve problems.

Yes as the battery level drops it will drop to a lower speed hence changing it on the remote automatically. If you wait 10 seconds or so as the battery builds you can go back up to a faster speed again but only for a short time and then all over again.

I have an idea that might help you. I think that the motor sensor wires got disconnected (for that motor). This fits the symptom you see of the motor trying to move and stopping (because there is no feedback). I think that may have happened when you changed the wheel settings (pulling on the wires will do that).

What I suggest is to open the board (from the top), look at the section where the wires come in and hook into the control board, and push the connectors back in place.

Something similar happened to me and that fixed it. Send some pictures while it is open. 
Also, I put some hotglue on the place where the wire harness gets into the body, with the hope that that will prevent the wires from accidentally pulling out (I'm not sure it will work but it will not do harm...)

I had the same problem and contacted Evolve Aus.

Got the following reply from Nick.

"What percentage was the board at when this happened?

If the board percentage drops below 30% (may be 20%) the mode will change back to ECO to conserve power, and stop the board from running the percentage to 0% and turning off."

My original remote never ever did that.

I was having connection problems, so sent my new spare remote back and wrote an additional note on the parts return/work authorization sheet asking them to remove the auto switch to ECO as I can do that myself.

Hi guys
I never build electric skateboard but there's a lot of you here with experience in it and I would like to know if you think it's possible to swap the evolve motor controller and remote for vesc with a rf remote and receiver and keep the evolve battery and motors on carbon and bamboo gt? Since all the random cut out, signal lost, shut down (I got all this issues with my boards) I'm not so confident with the board now.
Thanks

You'll need 2 VESCs, never seen anyone done that but should be possible and would be an upgrade and while doing that, maybe replace the battery aswell...
But If you do this DIY-stuff, there is no point in buying a 2000 Eur board and modify it. You can build a similar board for about half the price.
People paid a lot of money and can expect Evolve to fix their stupid connection-problems.

Heard back from Evolve.

"We do not have the capacity to custom program the remotes. I canâ€™t stop it from switch to ECO mode at lower battery percentage.

If you are definitely wanting this function, I would need to send you an older remote.
 
Let me know how you would like to proceed."

I opted for an older remote. At least there is a choice to switch over.

Hi everyone, 
I got my first electric longboard today, bamboo GT, today and took it for a ride! This thing is awesome but I've got a few questions and hope I might be able to hear some opinions from other riders. 
I started in slow but quickly bumped up to fast and GT, which were awesome. After around 4 miles of cruising I started up a long but small hill. I was crushing at about 18 mph, thinking how cool this thing was when about 3/4 of the way up the hill it threw me off the front(lost power??) I had pads on and managed to not hurt myself but it was an awakening... this thing could seriously hurt me. 

When I started riding again I noticed it was in ECO mode, I am sure I was in GT while going up the hill. On the rest of my ride back I watched the remote and the battery levels were all over the place, it would show as low as 12% and then at times it would jump back to mid 50%'s. And a few more times it switched back to ECO mode on me. By the time I was almost back home it seemed like the battery was dead, but when I would stop the battery was showing over 40% but by the way it was preforming im pretty sure if I had to go any further I would have been walking. Are these typical experiences when the battery is getting low? My overall ride was around 5 miles and I was testing out all the modes? I had the AT tires on.

Better live in a pretty flat area like me and not be a fat ass at the same time.  Even with 20T(pretty big jump) motor pulleys (stock is 15T), my CGT has been running fast and strong, with absolutely no signs of slowing down.  If I lived in a hilly area, I would probably just run the Kegels (80mm) plus the optional 38T drive gears (but top speed would slow as hell, maybe 90mm flywheels). If it still doesn't work, then I would burn this thing like firewood and go DIY (well....I actually have a build coming my way soon)

The percentage issue is normal.  The battery percentage is pretty useless most of the time. I simply look at the trip meter haha. I already know how many miles I can ride and pretty much ignore the battery percentage meter.

So, I purchased an Evolve Carbon GT from Evolve USA I live in Canada, I waited 2 months and finally got it but when it arrived I got to ride it for 20min or so during day & night but there was an issue with the remote and with one of the motors and it eventually stopped working that same day it arrived! Needless to say I sent it back! I waited another 2 weeks and today Dec 1 2016 it arrived. My mother-in-law was home I came an hour after it showed up and the product was now worse than ever. The box was completely destroys, the board was broken, I took many photos and video to show them plus I filed a UPS claim on their behalf and I'm sure they will get their money back but refuse to compensate ME!! 

Evolve emailed me back today and they said that they will NOT be giving me a full replacement board OMG! I thought I read somewhere that they had great customer service! I guess so much for that!! This is part of their response and this is after they told me to file a claim with UPS which I did immediately..

"Hi Chris,
Great! We have filed the claim on this end as well.

I can understand your frustration, I will be sending a replacement base plate first thing tomorrow morning so you can get back to carving again!

Please note, as we are not at fault for the unfortunate damage to your board, I am unable to fulfill your request for a complete replacement."

I DON'T want a replacement base plate I only wanted a NEW Carbon Fiber Board which is what I PAID for and they are refusing to do so even though we both filed a claim from which Evolve will get compensated I'm sure! Needless to say I will call my Amex and get my money back I am a very loyal customer with them and they will do what is necessary for me since my purchases yearly are in excess of $100K.

I am not happy at all to say the least very bad customer support & a horrible experience I advise anyone here to stay away regardless of how good you think their boards are...I also paid over and above the incoming FEES for duties and taxes on the REPAIRS that they did on the motor that went bad! They put an astronomical price for repairs on the bill so the government charged me TAX on those repairs coming back INTO Canada WTF? Why would Evolve do that? I am out of pocket money close to $3000USD now because I even bought other things from them to compliment the board like lights, wheels, fast charger etc and this is what I get! SHAME on you EVOLVE!!

Wth just happened.  @HI-DEF-DEPOT completely got screwed over and I would be totally pissed off if I was him.  He absolutely deserves a completely new board or a full refund.  It looks like even the damaged trucks themselves scratched up portions of the CF deck.  Now, I know its a skateboard and it will eventually get scratched anyways but still, he paid for a new board and if anything, the only acceptable damages would be ones caused by himself. 

I tagged @BoardSportsRN because he was able to get a refund.  How he got it, I don't know. Thats why I tagged him because he knows how.

Sorry for causing all this trouble, we can all get along I hope. BoardSportsRN hates Evolve while I absolutely love my CGT (tho I can't say I love Evolve as a company as I have had problems dealing with their customer service myself) and we get along.

You're not the one who paid $3000 with all the extras I bought from them and the board is badly scratched too boot...I never owned it for more than half a day and when it arrived I had a dead remote and had to wait 48hrs for the remote's battery to die to try & reset it so it started off bad from the start then the board was hiccuping every now & then while riding in the day but I let it slide because I thought it may be because I didn't charge it & needed a full charge but that was not the case, it had a bad motor which they replaced granted when I shipped it back to them only for it to arrive back to me in pieces :-(

I ONLY want a NEW WORKING board which is what I paid for or my money back, this is called bad customer service as if it was my fault I got a lemon from the start & then to add fuel to the fire someone tampers with the box as per the photos you can clearly see and destroys the board in the meantime and I have to be stuck with this? 

Let's face it they have insurance with UPS we both filed a claim so that they can get paid for the damages so why are they being like this? They should replace it INSTANTLY if they want to be known as a great company.

Hey All,

This is a brand new Carbon GT. While riding I've noticed strange lags between the controller and the motor. Can a few other Carbon GT owners take a look at my video and let me know if this is indeed faulty behavior? Or is it normal?

Thanks!

That doesn't seem normal at all to me man. How do you pair your remote? I always turn the board on first and then hold the left button until i see the the pairing symbol. Make sure that you don't press the trigger at all until it is fully paired and you see the battery percentage.

Definitely faulty, I have had my CGT since launch week in the US and have never experienced even a tiny bit of lag. Contact Evolve, that thing can send you flying off the board in no time. Too dangerous to ride as is.

This is the message that I got back from Evolve. I followed the process, and my first ride since was smooth, but Iâ€™ll need a few days to determine if the problem is truly solved. Thanks everybody!

> Thank you for your email, it was forwarded to me in tech support.

> What I am guessing is that when you turned on your board, you may have touched the trigger or moved the board before the complete pair took place. This, or resyncing incorrectly. Its very common, as we like to jump on our boards before they completely pair.

> It most likely just needs to be resynced now so that it completely finds its neutral point, and keep in mind when turning on the board thereafter, never touch anything (especially the remote) during the process until the board finds the pair on its own so as not to disturb the neutral point.

> Here is the correct syncing procedure that we use here:
> Pairing tips and procedure:

> The Board should have already been synced.

> Here is the way I sync all boards:
> 1) Turn on board FIRST. The blue led will begin flashing from the power button.
> 2) Turn on remote by pressing and holding right button until EVOLVE logo appears and initial screen is displayed but not showing battery percentage yet.

> 3) Then, immediately press and HOLD the left button until the battery percentage screen appears. Making sure to not let go until you see a battery percentage appear.

> IMPORTANT Note: Make sure the entire time, you are NOT touching the trigger or the board, so it finds its neutral point.
> Even when turning on thereafter before each ride, do not touch anything until pairing is complete and battery percentage pops up on the screen.

> Let me know if that corrects the issue. You should be able to notice a smoother modulation on a bench test even before riding, if paired correctly.

My Bamboo GT has been flawless over ~10 charge cycles, and I just received the Carbon GT yesterday (not yet tested). I hope Evolve makes your UPS issue right. I once had them destroy a custom mountain bike build-box was splayed open & looked like a truck had run over it. Bike frame was damaged, and I had to wait for a new build. It is the shippers responsibility here in the US to file a claim with the carrier THEY contracted to deliver the board. Is there some reason you had to file the claim...international shipment, maybe? Evolve's note does say "we have filed a claim from this end too".  That box looks like it got wet and soft, and I think it would take more pressure than a hard drop to break that base plate. Finish damage on the deck should warrant a replacement if it's a new product. That is where the situation goes south for me, based on your description. Was the deck damaged in shipping, and did you send them pics? Any luck with your refund?

The deck was definitely damaged during shipping it is scratched everywhere I only had it for a few hours and only rode it twice in the day & at night there wasn't ANY scratches on the board I sent it back looking like it was NEW and the box was taped nicely & it also looked NEW. The way the box came back looks like it was 15 years old from all the holes and damages it has and the board is scratched from the bottom and the top. I paid for a NEW board & ONLY had it for a FEW hours of just 1 DAY so I don't see why Evolve is giving me a hard time :-( needless to say I opened a claim with Amex they said they need 6-8 weeks. I sent Photos to Evolve & I offered the short video I took as well which I have now put it on Youtube but no answer for a new replacement or a refund yet I am still in the dark. UPS came back & took the board because of the damage claim & I even had the Abec 11 Flywheels (97mm 78a) on the board which I NEVER got to ride yet not even once so I don't even know what they feel like but I hope they send me new wheels too which is what I paid for since they are on the old deck or at least send me those wheels back If they decide to replace my board.

Honestly I'd recommend you talk to Adam over the phone. He's very nice and would definitely help you with the refund process. He helped me a lot during the buying and even learning/messing with the board process and was very cooperative about warranty measures etc. 

Honestly spreading hate about Evolve isn't going to accomplish anything other than deter some people that might have truly enjoyed the board. There have been many happy customers (myself included) but (I really don't mean this offensively) you and @BoardSportsRN are being much more vocal than any of the other customers. I'm being honest - I've only ever seen 3 people unhappy about their Evolve board and its the same 3 people that spam their distaste towards Evolve everywhere.

I understand @BoardSportsRN's point of view however because his is literally about a flaw the board has (voltage sag) him being vocal about it isn't bad at all - however even he's a bit extreme about it (sorry) as the sag isn't enough to ruin the entire experience the board offers. 

Hopefully I didn't offend anyone - I'm just trying to put my humble opinion out there so people understand.

I see. I was unaware of Adam being powerless. In this case I 100% agree with you and the man deserves much better. 

But about the "I can think of 3 people off the top of my head who were injured to the point of requiring medical attention by their GT"... Evolve can't be blamed for someone not being able to ride their board. No matter what - EVEN if the board shut off, the board would coast to a stop. I'd like the link to the post in which the UART cable is loose (but I will take your word for it for now and say that is unacceptable). 

About the voltage sag. It *is* an issue. But I haven't noticed it negatively affecting performance until the battery falls below 50%.  My cables also seem to be perfectly in tact and connected properly. Everything is in working order and they fixed the remote so you can't accidentally engage reverse while cruising. This either means that they are learning and fixing or you got unlucky (in which case, that happens with every company).

Well I guess I got my board after the major fixes so I haven't experienced anything particularly awful. I agree with the 15 mile statement though for sure. You HAVE to set it to ECO after 15 miles or else it will change it for you. I wonder if Evolve Australia is just as bad as the USA retailer. But I can't say I've had a bad experience with them. They've been great to me but the only thing was not being able to choose what street wheels I for with my board when Australia gets to choose. Eh.

Problem I haven't seen reported here.

On the CGT after under 20hrs of total ride time the board nuked itself. After a full charge of the board it hasn't turned back on again. Battery pack shows green when plugged in and there is no blue LED on the power button when pressed. 

I've shot Evolve Au an email but no response today, they usually take a day or so to get back to me. As everyone with a problem has experienced I've had some major shipping delays on spare parts (remote) rendering the board useless for a month while I waited for the replacement. Not much you can do.

For those looking to avoid this, ensure you switch the board off while charging. Store the board at 50% while not in use for more than a few days. MAKE SURE THAT IS FAST 50%, ECO MODE DISPLAYS A FALSE 50% (actual power is 30% on eco 50%) thats not exact but based on riding experience and rarely using ECO. That seems to be the only two things that could have nuked the battery IMO. 

If anyone has any ideas/questions/fixes drop us a line :slight_smile:

Not to get on your case, but if I was Evolve customer support, I would have done the same thing. Have you seen that guy's trucks and board? The board is f**king destroyed! I ride my Carbon GT every day while flying up driveway lips on flywheels and I only have some small chips on the trucks and slight abrasions to the deck - nowhere near as bad as his. 

I'm taking Evolve USA's side because I talk to them fairly often and they are genuinely some of the nicest people I have ever dealt with. I crashed my skateboard at 24 mph into a brick wall and broke the front truck arm in half and when I told them, they sent out a replacement for free without even asking me. When I told them I dropped my remote and I was having connection issues, Brandon told me to be careful and offered me a replacement for free - I declined because I realized it was my fault, I just had to re-pair it. Trust me, they make sure to take care of you.

Same issue here, and I bought the board from a friend that bought it in April of 2017, but decided it is to dangerous for him.
I am from Romania, the board was bought from UK, and they claim the warranty is not transferable, so even though the board is 3 months old, I have no more warranty on it.

I decided to open it up and found an unfinished BLDC controller, with 1 Buck converter around LM2596HVS (which is piece by piece copied from the aliexpress product) to step down from 36V to 12 V, which is further routed to the input of an 78L05 linear regulator, for the comparator, microcontroller, and PWM drivers 5V, and then another linear regulator for the NRF transceiver 3.3V.

Gosh, this is a hell of an energy waste for a battery powered application.

Second point would be the motor's control which is purely based on HALL sensors, and nothing to do with FOC in my oppinion, the feedback from the phases of the motor does not reach the input of the microcontroller to read the Back EMF, the voltage divider from these traces are missing....

So now I am just an unhappyowner of an Evolve GT Carbon street board which sometimes works, but I can not trust it...

I will however be glad to put my oscilloscope on the UART lines between the BMS and control board to try understanding the protocol, and planing to reuse the whole thing except the motor controller for my own motor controller, and maybe after that, a better battery pack, and a better remote.

I hope everyone who reads this understands that this board is an unfinished product and should be  a prototype on developer's bench, and not even for testing phase yet.

This product does not worth more than 800USD IMHO, but is sold for the ridiculous price of 2000USD, at least in Europe.

Not to mention that on my board, the DC Bus capacitors had desoldered terminals on two of them caused of bad cold soldering process!!!!!!!!!

Shame Evolve, Shame!!!!!!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/3/d32cc4f8f16752e387a6acce306312c1fe96511a.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/7/5737db18dde76956f6f0f5294d06d8f0c3ecc895.jpg" width="666" height="500">

To be clear, Changing under warranty, for me ot means that the client shouldn't support shipping costs for the broken part shipping to them, and the replacement back to client, unless you are available to throw money for a second board on transactions of broken to new prone to failure designed parts.

Just now digging back through the threads, does anyone have handy a source for replacement motors for Evolve CGT?  I remember them perhaps being the same as Ollin 5065's  Also someone had swapped out for red Maytech ones?  Any guidance on what works, and links (even to old thread I can't seem to find lol)?  Thanks!

They're Brother Hobby 140kv motors. Similar to Ollin's but Ollin's lowest kv is 170, though that will work and be a bit faster.

Thanks @Jinra and @mccloed was scouring as @chaka was sold out of his lowest KV 5065 17KV.  $200ea from Evolve, but not sure I can wait until late August.  Looks like Banggoods can get it to me in 5-8 business days, anyone had luck with them and can trust their expedited shipping estimates?

Not knowing much but about the insides of these motors, the pile of this one has become loose and sloppy. Now just noise but probably getting progressively worse. Anyone can tell me what is happening here, how to fix or avoid it in future?  Not sure if has to do with bearing or just got whacked hard and now will be off unless replaced. Need to upload Quick video of how pushing the motor pulley and pole moves intward a few mm. Any guidance much apppreciated, thanks!

Oof, that's not good. Noise = contact, contact = friction, friction = heat, and heat = dead motor...

Could you take a video of it indoors while not riding (bench testing) and try to isolate the problem motor.

I have been noticing for the past month my range dropping much lower. Then even full charged I could not run more then a block up hill in GT mode without the board completely turning off. Ok so run it in fast mode only. 
Just had to replace my second warranty motors with a third pair(bought the board in November) so I could get to the awesome raptor 2 demo. Moja great to meet you. 
So brand new on a full charge with my riding style in s.f. 12miles was my best range ever. Then 11 and 10 and so on until now lucky to get 7. 
No good
Then today on my controller I get a red flashing light in the shape of a battery.  Plug it in at home... will not take a charge. I tried both chargers with the same results. 
Anyone else have this problem?

I got that fault a few times when I run the battery fully dead. Which you definitely should not do btw, damages batttety in ways that effect range lol. Anyway, mine never persisted and was fine to charge again after an overnight timeout. Sounds like your problem may be worse if it has been more than 24 hours. I also have a programmable charger l use, which might help if you know someone near you that you can borrow.

The lipo's Evolve uses seem pretty crappy.. Lipos are supposed to have a higher discharge potential than li-ion, but they somehow made theirs sag even more so than li-ion cylinder cells. I wouldn't be surprised if their cycle life was pretty poor as well.

I'm very curious if anyone's ever measured their 0% voltage on their boards. My guess is that Evolve runs them pretty low, just hopefully not dangerously low. To add to that, I would verify with an actual multi-meter than completely trust the remotes voltage meter.

Hey Guys,

My Board is the Bamboo GT.

IÂ´ve got some weird behaviour of my board and I do not know if this is normal.

I had some Problems with one of my Motors getting too hot while riding uphill.

the reason was that one of the Motor hall sensors disconnetcted and I was running straight uphill with only one of the Motors.

So it got too hot and the board shut down. After this I was not able to turn on the board until I disconneted every plug from the battery and BMS.

After waiting a few minutes and reconnecting the boards it worked again and the blue power led was blinking.

I thought everything is fine but it isnÂ´t. One of the Motors did not work.

So I tried do Exchange Motors on the Controller to make sure it is a Motor issue and not a controler error.

After exchanging still the same Motor does not work so it seems to be an Motor error.

So I ordered two 140kV Motors from Racestar as a replacement. I am still waiting for these.

Today I tried to Charge my board but it didnÂ´t work. The chargerÂ´s LED does not turn to red. The battery is at 50% and it should charge now. Please remember that one of the Motors is still damaged. Could this be the reason?

I unpluged both Motors and hall sensors and tried it again but still no charging.

Can you help me with this? Any similar experiences? 

Best regards!
```

Sometimes this is a failure mode of a charger, and can be worked around by plugging in the skateboard first, then plugging in the charger

Unlikely to be.  It'd be more likely that the damaged motor caused damage elsewhere

From whom?  My Racestar motors from banggood never arrived and I'm trying to get a refund.  My unease at ordering from a Chinese business was well-founded...

Iâ€™ve got a Carbon GT in AT mode. Iâ€™ve got brand new belts and brand new pulleys on the motors, and yet whenever I break hard, the belts slip. They are adjust to be as tight as possible. Is there a solution to this?

## \#237 Posted by: Idle Posted at: 2018-02-03T04:36:48.057Z Reads: 113

What size pulleys and belts do you have, and what's the center to center distance?

Edit: center to center distance can be determined with belt length and pulley sizes on a belt length calculator. 
I'll try to find it..

The only logical explanation is the large wheel pulley doesent allow enough teeth on the motor pulley to be engaged.

Perhaps you have enough adjustability to use longer belts.
That would help somewhat, but don't know to what degree.


Disclaimer:
I don't have an evole and although I've seen a couple, I didn't really check them out in detail.

Belt length calculator:
https://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/


Enter:
Metric
Htd5
Pulley sizes
Type something in the center to center (ctc)  distance try 80mm..

Should show a belt length needed..
Adjust ctc distance untill your own belt length is displayed.
Look at the teeth engaged on small pulley. 

Hope that helps..

Yeah going to need more detail here. If itâ€™s an Evolve belt and set of pulleys then that is not the issue as it sized correctly. Need to see how tight the belt is when adjusted to motor furthest out. How far does the belt bend down when you push it fully tightened?  Is that more flex than you have in street setup?  A picture or video?  Because if itâ€™s not a worn or stretched belt and new motor pulley teeth, and proper new evolve belt Les and pulleys then the adjustment of motor to bracket may be off. Is this a new thing or has always been the case?

Honestly man, I hate to say it but this is normal. I have never been able to get full braking power out of my GT without the belt skip. It only skips after about 70-80 percent braking power, but iv'e never been able to fix it.

The large pulley on the wheel(and the inertion from those big at wheels) and the small drive pulley just don't have enough pulley tooth contact(motor pulley side). I'm working on a design right now to cnc myself some motor mounts with idlers in hopes of finally getting rid of the skip.

Donâ€™t mean to wake up an old thread but my board is having some serious issues. When I turn my board on (full charge on both remote and board) it seems to pair with the remote and work fine for about ten seconds but after that it stops responding completely. This proves to be rather dangerous as it started happening while I was riding down a hill the other day :/ I was hoping if someone could identify the source of the issue and maybe inform me on how I could go about fixing it? Thanks!!

I have lag between mode/gear shifts on my R1 remote (GT bamboo).  This is major problem when starting up a hill and shifting up to get torque (ECO mode has very little), ...being unsure if it shifted up from ECO to FAST, so you tap again, trying not to loose anymore speed, and BOOM your in GT mode, the board goes from 2mph to 20 instantly, and the rider gets thrown. This specifically has caused me two major accidents, the last one landed me plate and 6 screws in my Fibia.

**Is anyone aware of a way to either address the lag? or hack the controller to disable GT mode?** It's mostly a commuter board for me on flat ground, so FAST is plenty for my needs.

PS: Taking suggestions for a very high support, rigid hightop skate shoe or boot... once I get my cast off.

There is a lag. My question is, why are you switching modes? Just stay in fast and lay off the throttle. The modes aren't a gear shift. I don't recommend changing them while riding. Find one you like and stick with it. Best,
