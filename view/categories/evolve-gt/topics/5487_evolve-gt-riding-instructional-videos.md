In case you haven't seen this yet... Boosted vs the new Evolve GT hill climb test.  Someone needs to do the same with a raptor.

@Mr_Mahal I think it's safe to say the evolve has way more torque than boosted based on how it owned the boosted in this hill climb.

Interesting towards the end of the video where it states 0-25mph (40kph) in 3 seconds compared to what I read previously, where someone said 5-6 seconds? Also, I thought the 83mm used in the video could only reach 22mph (36kph).

The two boards-in-one design aspect seems to get overlooked in most the comparison commentary. I think it is a significant point of difference in the offering compared to most other commercial boards. It knocks on the door of fast/ torquey (raptor's wins out), it appears smooth and refined with a good remote (boosted might win out, maybe, not sure), solid range, and can do both road and offroad by design (not too many doing that out of the box), and can carve. Doesn't appear to have made too many compromises to achieve this except perhaps the price (although as an Australian I feel we gained an advantage here- it was pretty much the same price as a raptor dual for me, and yet to see the boosted V2 int shipping costs). Still impressed but it'll be good to see some real reviews soon.

I guess ignorance is bliss.
I understand there is a battery discharge curve and power is reduced as the battery gets lower but the battery is so big. it has been quite dependable but you are right I am not an engineer but I am happy

@BoredSportsRegisteredNurse

Troll another site. 
You sound like a little girl. 
Make a better board. 

It's a haiku!

With all your engineering and manufacturing wisdom why don't you make a better looking, better performing, and perfect board. Otherwise STFU (I know you like acronyms).

Apologies for intervening @BoardSportsRN  but you have made your point about how bad your experience with the GT was, several times and in other threads too. You have informed as all about it and we thank you about it. You returned your product and got a refund (which is nice to know in case we also get in the same trouble). Now I believe it is time to get over it and proceed with your next board and let this thread take its path.
This comes from a "so far" satisfied GT user but tired of this complaining about Evolve

Well its no surprise that there are some people who are not satisfied with the GT. It would be impossible  to make absolutely everyone love it. I have one and I love this thing, despite some issues I had with it (bad BMS, I had to send it back). Another issue I had was the motor pinion wearing out too fast. It might be the way I ride it, GT 100% of time and accelerating and breaking hard all the time.

Love the passion and the desire to help us Luddites stay informed, 2k is a lot of money to spend on something that should simply be able to transport said individual within the specified / advertised specs from the manufacturer without the consumer feeling fleeced.

The sag is not what concerns me more the cut outs and having to lick my unessasery wounds from slamming into the back of a car to avoid the cut out / break fail resulting in me loosing my life at an intersection

For me I was heading downhill on 97% battery so if anything that regen breaking should have been taking me up in power right Vader? Anyway I'll await to hear back from the Evolve guys and update you on the response. 

My mentality is if I buy something that is advertised as "gold standard" I don't expect instant failure and being given the run around on how I should have to pay to send my board to them when it was less that a week old. 

What you riding now Capitan complano and how can I get me one ;)
