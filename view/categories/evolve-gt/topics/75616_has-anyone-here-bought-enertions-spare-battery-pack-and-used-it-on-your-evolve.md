Hello Esk8:ers.

I am new here and looking at upgrading my Bamboo GT:s battery to 10s4p.
My plan is to buy Enertions spare battery, connect the BMS from my battery, switch the conectors and go.

Has anyone here bought Enertions spare battery pack and used it on your Evolve?

It costs 254 Euros with shipping at the moment so it sould like a good deal.

I searched for this but did not find anyone who had done it.

/Best regards.
