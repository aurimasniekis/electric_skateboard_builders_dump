Hey guys.
As some of you may have seen, I've been in the market for a board and have been tossing up whether to buy or build.
In my research or different boards and products, I've come across a couple of new videos from Evolve Skateboards of what looks to be an pretty awesome new remote and possibly a new board.

One video looks to have a different board in the back ground. In the other Jeff mentions a new board?

Reckon I might be holding out to see what this brings before jumping on anything.

Check out the videos.

Oh great...more shit to distract a rider...phone in one hand .... Skateboard diagnostic tool in the other ...

A trigger is all you need

Likewise, I'm holding out for the release. My guess is their new model(s) will address the weaknesses of their previous models, namely not enough torque, not enough ability to customize settings, not enough info on remaining range. Can't wait!

Looks like they still use a single bulky motor.
A new controller and another wheel color doesn't make the product any better.
Good for some causal cruising in the flats but not if you have some claims in performance.

Speed and battery status at a glance? I'd love to have those features! I also like that there area easily switchable "modes." I've never ridden an evolve board, but folks seem to love them.

I don't quite understand the display that shows the gearing of the motor pulley and wheel pulley -  it seems like a static feature that wouldn't need to be displayed dynamically. Maybe one can tap a button and change the feeling of the acceleration to mimmic those gearings?

Wondering what replacement cost is of that fancy remote when you drop it. But ya, I'm looking forward to seeing the new board, if only to get new design ideas :smile:

I think the gear ratio is what works out your speed. So the esc knows the motor rpm. And thn you select your ratio so that it can display the correct speed.

Yes I loved the ride on my Evolve. Really decent acceleration. The biggest issue in my opinion was the overall length coupled with the weight biased to the back end. In short they were a bitch to carry. 

I did notice in the first video that it appears they are using a different belt/motor housing. Looks a little smaller and more custom as opposed the giant chunk of metal on their current rides.

@lowGuido I think you're right, but does that mean that Evolve is now supporting different options for their motor and wheel pulleys? I've never seen any options in their online store, which is why I thought they were static.

Exactly, you can download free apps that have a speed reading that is very accurate.

Also, with the emergence of apple watch & android watch it would be rather easy to develop an app that has all the speed related data on your wrist.

ALSO With gyros & accelerometers in your phone you could probably also get this data:
- G force
- Hoprsepower
- deduce a torque measurement
- Possibly even a fuel gauge based on timeXmovementXaverage power consumption.

The app might get you to perform some simple calibrations, such as a 100m sprint, enter body weight, wheel size, 


Someone better at maths & physics could probably elaborate on this further....

I have used phone app's before with cycling and have found they tend to start chewing battery pretty quickly. 
I use a garmin device on my bike now. It is one option while riding, but would be annoying to hold in hand as well as a remote.

The new Evolve will be awesome.  Get your orders in.  Still think the Raptor is the one to beat at the moment for completes. Untill the production version can be tested back to back.

I do wonder however if the battery of the remote can last with having to deal with extra features.  Ive just used my Raptors for over 1.45hrs.  Space cell ran out before remotes.  No point making a board that can go for longer range if the remote cant last.

So since I came across the recent videos from Evolve, I've been following their releases to see what is coming.
They just released another video!
Holy crap. It is looking pretty good to me.
@onloop you must have predicted the future. DUAL MOTORS!!!!

It's looking pretty sleek.

Really looking forward to seeing more for this.

That's cool, but evolve always used gutless low powered motors.. Any idea of actual power? Two motors might make it more stable, but there are too many higher powered options available if they haven't stepped up their power game?

Meh......... 30-40 people on this forum can make that video with current builds. It's a nice shot but I am unimpressed. I think evolve is (ironically) evolving too slow. Dont get me wrong they led the way at the beginning, but now......meh. I'll wait and see what they show ......then read their hype and do the exact same trial/ claim for 400 bucks cheaper and with upgrading options.

I'm gonna say:

- Li-ion battery similar to what whitepony on ES did to his carbon all terrain.

- sensors in motors

- VESC-esque ESC

- "water proofed" motors

- new "light"material board.

- and two 63 motors on wide ass trucks

The truck is not as wide as the AT evolve carbon.  Because the motors are outside it can sit lower and due to the carve out for the wheel bite it sits really low to ground.  Motors in black non of that ugly housing in current version. It looks good.  I am keen to know real world distance and speed.  Raptor for the completes and DIY will still likely have it over this new board.

I believe this new evolve board wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the birth of the Raptor....

The Raptor forced Evolve to step up & offer some performance.

This forum has educated the masses about what makes a really good electric skateboard! what real performance is! Now the masses want better!

**The Raptor is an Industry Disraptor!**

That's a big call. 
Fairly certain they were the first with carbon decks. 
Says it's been in production for 2 years. 
Makes for a fairly certain next step from what they have. 
I'm not saying they're first with dual motors, but if they have been developing for couple years, should be good. 
And thinking that video is about showing performance is like thinking a race car is an accurate portrayal of its production counterpart.
It's an advert to grab attention. 
Yes it is supposed to be exhilarating. That's marketing.

Basically I'm still waiting til they actually release specs.

Yeah but that is not really the whole story is it?

example: my boards are designed in Australia too, they are assembled here too, but i source majority of parts from china, the motor controller is custom made (now in USA) designed in Sweden, the battery cells are Korean & assembled in china. 

To give you some insights to the origins of the evolve technology have a look at this post, the didn't really design anything to begin with... Even now their motors are commonly seen on most "china" style eboards.

Hi Owen, Do you work for evolve? 

anyway... the truth is I really love what evolve are doing, I look up to what Jeff has done & it inspires me to grow & build a legit brand & business just like he has.... I have got a lot of catching up to do though! Evolve is proably 100X bigger than enertion in terms of sales & revenue. I'm just a small guy!

I do know how hard Jeff has had to work to get his business where it is today... I love that he is about to release a new model.... I haven't been this excited in a while, it will fuel my passion even further to make the best electric skateboards I can from my little garage..... & I do love a good challenge.

So YES, in many ways I am trying to emulate what Jeff is doing, but I am also walking my own path... I am probably more focussed on the community & educating people about how to build their own esk8... Jeff has not taken that direction.

& I think If you asked Jeff honestly what he thinks about enertion (me) so far, I think he would admit that I am doing a good job... Take his new product release as an example, a dual drive esk8 with brushless outrunners.... If he thought what I was doing is shit why would he do it too? I am sure his new deck will be awesome & it will likely slow down the Raptor sales... & I dare say Raptor sales has probably slowed down Evolve sales a tad. I will need to get smarter & I will need to hone my business acumen.... it's very exciting.

Deep down we are all here because we love esk8! Hopefully, one day soon Jeff & I can have a beer and talk shop.... I am sure we would get on very well.

Until then we will both be working tirelessly to make the best esk8 we can.... Competition is great for innovation... & its great for the consumer.

So lets do it! Enertion VS Evolve! Aussie VS Aussie... Watch out world...We will show you what passion & drive can deliver! If anyone should be worried it should be BB

I am ready... is evolve :)

my design is a physical expression of my own desires, this object was not created to please everyone, pleasing everyone is impossible.

I believe building an electric skateboards is an art form. We should refrain from criticising the aesthetic & start celebrating the act of creation.

This is why I focus on the community of builders first & foremost. The more people who learn how to create an esk8 the more amazing & varied forms of art will be created.

 Bhahahaha Ha .....dude joined the forum 5 hours ago.....welcome Owen, care to introduce yourself or do you just want write some fun play on words. 

@OwenGrady This is a DIY community man, and Jason - like it/ him or not has promoted and informed the shit out of DIY and helped more people build a board without breaking the bank than evolve has customers. 

Dude (Onloop) builds a base for you to sell to as well, and is starting to get to a level where he probably is pulling a good bit of your business, and making yourself look like an ass in his forum.....is piss poor marketing for evolve.


- I assume you are an evolve guy - maybe make that clear rather than joining a forum you have never had anything to do with and trying to talk a little shit.

Also if you are going to play with words check your science ........ raptors still exists and are going strong.....if you will recall in science.....those Dino's evolved and are now birds of prey.

Finally- it ain't bout beauty- for most, it's about the ride.

Way to make evolve look like douche waffles 
Put up or shut up

Hi BrabRS, onloop & monkey32. Also anyone else who cares to know.

Do I work for evolve? No. But I'll concede I like to think I'm not far from the group. For now though, just a very satisfied customer.

Am I team Evolve? Damn straight. Seemingly as much so as monkey32 is for team Enertion.

I have been lurking the forums for a long while yes, and at one stage considered going the DIY route.. But I rode a bamboo street, and for me the deal was done.  What they did with 350w makes me doubt the need for some of the silly numbers I hear thrown about. I am happy to pay a brand who know their stuff for a board I just want to ride, and I'm super excited for what comes next, even if it does have silly numbers attached.
I more peruse this forum for interest and lately the fact that a search for evolve's new board info brought me to this topic. As with every forum, I am entitled to comment my opinions, and wield my keyboard sword if the time requires.  I found this topic to be that time.

@brabrs I have no specs to provide, sorry to spoil your hopes! Though I did fluke a chance to see some testing of the board a few months back, I can definitely say they haven't taken baby steps with this one. Call the guys at the shop, you'll hear even they are intimidated by what it can do, and they are all passionate electric skaters! I'm sure Jeff will show this when the time is right, but I guess that's fine for you cause evolve clearly doesn't excite you anyway.

@onloop Firstly, credit to your response. With previous statements, I will admit the vibe I was expecting was quite different to what you did actually say. You have done a huge job with the forum, and the positivity in your response I hope was genuine.  I understand this is your forum, but you know evolve has a huge customer/fan base that are very passionate about the brand.  Making public a mockery of their video where they take no shots at you, is interesting business tact. While I don't know you, or really have a negative opinion of you personally, you are picking a fight with this video, and the evolve mob won't like it. I'm merely pointing out that making a claim as such, and a video parody, hoping it results in a friendly chat and a beer.. might not really add up to the positive relationship you intend. I've only met Jeff a handful of times and he is very protective of his work. If evolve is 100x bigger, I'd be careful claiming the chicken or the egg, because clearly he is doing something right.  I do wish you luck with your raptor, hopefully it will be competitive to the market, but right now evolve is definitely the bigger fish.


Oh and monkey32, about that science lesson.. Dinosaurs may have evolved into 'birds of prey', but apes evolved into today's apex predators.. See how those dinosaur teeth go against the human's technological ability to kill anything. We are the modern apex predator & top of the food chain.  Though by name, it seems you only got as far as the peeling bananas stage.. Maybe next time, for now best keep big bird on Sesame Street 😉 
I'd shut up, but class is still in session.

Enertion is fine, actually quite similar to evolve in what Jason is trying to build. I'm pro- learn to build cool shit. This forum is about that.

Does Onloop push his product- you bet your ass, but this place is a service to many and information hole above and beyond anything else out there with the exception of ES.

@OwenGrady Some have evolved more than others its true. I am far from the most refined well developed individual. In complextion I may be a knuckle dragging, banana loving Goober and I'll be the first to admit it. However to me I have always found it better to be a tinkering monkey, learning how things work , helping others learn and improving myself........I mean what's the other option........a guy trolling forums aimed at helping those of us lacking means but wanting to ride?

But yea, you keep doing you man. I'll keep doing me.

Welcome to the community Owen. 

My response above is genuine. It would be an honour to meet Jeff... I would certainly buy him a beer. I am not a hater.

My parody video is a simple marketing tactic.. the more people I can get talking about eboard performance the more people I will be able to educate & offer my service to... brand loyalty only goes so far.

Jeff knows performance matters, If he didn't think it mattered he would not be releasing the new & improved model primarily promising improvements in performance as the key feature. This is happening because his loyal customer base are now demanding better, the customer knowledge is evolving faster than the company.. 

Honestly, Who doesn't want more speed & performance? I bet you do? This community is proof of that. The viewership here is skyrocketing! 40k last month... 1700 people just yesterday reading about how to make high-performance electric skateboards.

At this point I think jeff doesn't have an option, he must deliver better performance.... or loose market share.

So if we are scoring the battle so far, it seems I've won round one already.... the audience wants more power & performance and I have written that script. You are an example of that... you are here now & the conversation about performance has already started... that is my primary objective. Educating the masses about what's possible in the world of esk8.

I put my eggs in the performance basket. Jeff has followed. The question is whether evolve is nimble enough! Will they be able to keep up? 

I imagine evolve has some massive overheads, they must also keep the COGS low as their business model relies heavily on wholesale channels. Unfortunately, high performance also equals high cost. So they are going to have some big pricing decisions to make.... they need to maintain healthy margins because they have a big bunch of resellers to keep happy. If their cost base increases just $100 that could push their retail price up an extra $400. The only way they can achieve high performance and keep their offering at current pricing is by investing in a huge amount of stock & mass producing parts (or using low-tech stuff).. this locks them into their "version" of technology for extended periods. Its a problem all tech companies have when they are bigger, how to scale & stay relevant?. It's hard to continually evolve when you have certain business constraints that prevent rapid evolution...

Enertion is small enough & nimble enough to turn on a dime. Our battery tech, motor controllers, power management technology & battery chemistry tech will constantly evolve.... 

The irony is enertion may evolve faster than evolve can. I don't really see how enertion can loose...

@monkey32 I will man. Fortunately, evolution was kind to this forum troll.
Please be clear though. I don't dislike onloop or any of what he has done, I've not actually discredited any of it. I do believe that getting up on a high horse and beating your chest only makes you a target, so you shouldn't be suprised if you get shot down.. It may not always end well for you. But hey, just my two cents of wisdom. Class dissmissed.

Back to the point now.. This new board definetly is interesting, hence my passion to it. If someone is on the fence re buying vs building, i think this will be a strong contender if the price is realistic. For those set on building, it may be inspiration, for others though.. Evolve already has runs on the board, I would definetely recommend checking out their product. It will be simple, and it will work straight out of the box - which if you are just after the ride, it will be all you need regardless.

It could be better, or it definitely is better but I dont care much. Buying is not as satisfying as building. The cost of my eboard is above boosted and or any noticeable brand released. But whats the fun in it? Having your self making it is half the fun of an eboard. Some didn't quite get that yet :smiley:

Its a pretty simple DIY with some parts and mix match to choose. Just like lego and puzzle. The fun is the process its self. The finished board is the reward.

Modifications is always the benefits of an eboard. Even on finished products, people want to add something.

Careful, here is my point. To claim you wrote the script, when you yourself have "carbon copied" so much so far is a bold statement. Really, in this case you are the the marc webb version of spiderman. Might be newer and have some fancy special effects, but really the story is still the same. No new script here.
Evolve set the bar for performance. Boosted, Marbel & yourself all set out to reach that. Other brands set about rebuilding their models to compete. You've had your turn, give evolve credit for theirs. Without them I doubt a good chunk of your customers would have even noticed an electric skateboard to begin with. To claim a round victory against this is absurd, a full three plus year lead with updating in the very ethos of their name.. I hope enertion evolves faster because really, there is a lot of catching up to do.

[/quote]

no, they didn't.... I suppose it depends on what your definition of performance is.

they do deserve credit for their carbon deck design with integrated battery! that was a really nice move.... they were the first in the world to do it... 

They also decided to improve the battery chemistry & capacity extending the ride time! that was smart!

they invested in molds to remake their hand controller! smart move! that helped to differentiate them from a growing market of me-too copycats.

But they kept the same motor controller & brick-like motor that all the other "players" like fiik, altered, exkate were using... that is what has held them back!

yeah, they upgraded their trucks with gullwing sidewinder clones & put on some nice urethane! they deserve credit for all that....

But, when it comes to the performance, it was pretty much the same as the rest of the mass produced china products... same motors, same motor controllers & same hand controller. (hence the new version - jeff is smart, he knows what his weakness is)

If I really wanted I could also start selling the same "evolve" drive train system tomorrow.. here is the Chinese factory that makes it

https://kaxamoto.en.alibaba.com/product/1812912213-212664882/Electric_Skateboards_for_Sale_280W_500W.html

BUT at enertion we choose not to get the cookie cutter option available to every man, I choose to make my own creation! Because at heart I am a true electric skateboard builder.... from the ground up.

The difference is I tell my various factories what I want them to make, I don't simply buy the mass produced product that they are offering to anyone who thinks they can make a quick buck. Everything (90%) is custom made to my spec. 

This is why it is so hard for others to copy enertion... My advantage is constant innovation and a stubborn "I can make it better" attitude.

Have you actually ridden an evolve? Especially the 4 year old gen1 your link is clearly trying to imitate. There is very little similar to what you have posted, & i know conclusively that the motors you referance, do not work with the evolve system. Its odd you criticize that they are not using they're own parts when their logo appears on near every component in the board. Its more curious that you question their originality, when the ideas enertion boards have been founded on are clearly not pioneering.

Your first gen boxy setups, cool stuff and definetly won't be confused as a rebrand of Alien Power Systems.

Dual motors, now theres something cool. Boosted will be stoked with your paintwork on their claim to fame.

Fully integrated carbon decks! True Innovation back in 2012 when guess who did it first.

People dont copy enertion, because they copy the orginals too. Imitation is flattery.

The unfortunate truth in your relationship with the electric skateboard, is that your something blue, is also your something borrowed.  Claiming to lead the charge here is fruitless outside your provision of this forum for commentry.  Huge credit to that, but trumpeting quality from a garage, against a company who started their 3rd gen before enertion even existed is not just ballsy, it sets an expectation above what you may have facility to meet. I dare say evolve already consistently sells numbers that outgun your entire production runs in a matter of days.. And have already learnt a lot of lessons you have yet to learn.
I also dare say, to think they might not have their own cards up their sleeve still, as you seem to hint with your at project, would be a decent gamble. Good luck, but i'd probably try get a bit more behind me before trying to shoot down one of the biggest players in your industry.

I just simply do not understand the hate. I mean its two different companies doing teo different aproaches. The concept of electric longboard goes way back, it started with just gas motor.

Seriously this conversation of whos better who follows who is nonsense. Theres no need to think. Making funny videos replicating others is a fine deal in the industry. All cars manufacturers did! So does apple try to make mac while ibm is already in the sky. Also facebook while there was friendster and shit. So whats your point really! If you evolve die hard fans than this forum is not for you, go find other evolve group forum.

Here is a place to DIY. We check evolve, boosted and other see what they did. Then we can step up the game while doing DIY up to the company, or even better as we people can just simply shoved more power in electric vehicle these days.

I am not pro enertion or pro evolve. But doing bs talk about who follows who and ridicule each other is simply showing negative attitude. Those videos above doesnt hurt anyone. So theres no problem and dont make problem!

ordering from those Chinese factories, you can put your logo one whatever you want.. its just the same as Fiik, or even hoverboards- rebrand them, maybe change the aesthetic (like a carbon deck, different trucks and wheels, etc) but the same base-board is the same.

Boosted didn't patend dual motors... so are all of us or any other company who uses two motors infringing upon Boosted's "claim to fame"? And so when Enertion has 2 outrunners as opposed to Evolve's single one, they are just copying Boosted? Dual motors offer better acceleration, breaking, and just an overall performance increase in general- it isn't just a boosted thing; hell, boosted sells a single drive!

bro, you don't get it- that link isn't imitating the evolve 1st gen, it **IS** the evolve first gen! that was the start to evolve, and then (as I mentioned above) Jeff went on to start modifying some of the stuff to improve and set them apart. Like Fiik or others, he got his start re-selling those Chinese boards.. 

And before you ask, I have ridden an Evolve Bamboo series- is it bad? no. Could you do way better for the money through Enertion, LongHairedBoy, or the DIY community? Hell yes.

Loving this thread. Just  goes to show how passionate you we all are. Coming as a purely off the shelf first time owner of an eboard. I can say the new Evolve will be great board for those looking for a new complete. Ive tried the current evolves and love the different rides they offers with the double truck system. At the end of the day though you cant beat the feeling I get at going 45km/hr at a whim and bombing up hills at pace.  The current Evolves are left for dust. Lets wait to see he specs and the real world numbers before we say anymore about the boards themselves.

I feel this topic needs to stay with the facts about the  board and we cant do that yet as we only have the marketing hype. The battle between companies needs to beep done elswhere. I'm with @laurnts on this one. @onloop you have fallen into the trolls trap.

@OwenGrady you have made yout point. Move on.

I see this topic as info as to what is out there. This forurm is for DIY. To gleam ideas. 

Can we just get it back to the topic. Which at moment theres no more news yet on the dual motor. Is there.Yet.

What I can say is that the Enertion motors are larger than the new Evolves from my eyes. Hope that Evolve deal with the battery life to make up for 2 motors  it now has to power.

Enough BS , back to original topic as @Dedbny stated. 

Have done some digging and found couple things out. Unofficially 

 so it goes, more power than boosted, more range than current carbon model from Evolve. 
Rumour they have limited the motor controller for safety and the acceleration and braking are smooth. 
On top of the digital remote. 
Gear option suggesting different running options?
Supposedly more info but this is all I've been able to get out. 

Still keen to see what they release for specs etc

Interesting topic, indeed. IMO, defending a mass produced, corporate product as better than enertions stuff is laughable. The reality is, like @onloop said, evolve can't turn on a dime, and switch things up too much. You have to be willing to go out on a limb. Still to this day, I have yet to see anyone else integrate working head/brake lights inside of an electric skateboard except me (I'm talking about lights inside of the pressed portion of the deck, not below or on the trucks). No one needs lights, but they are cheap to add, and make night time riding much safer and easier. I know, some big company will do this before I even have a chance to start an llc, and put this into into the market. I when I try to say that I had this idea first, some fan boy will come along and complain that "x, y, or z did it first". The reality is, the DYI community has technology far greater than the corporate community. By the time companies like inboard get their "new hub technology" shipped, the DYI community will have (and does have) a handful of hub motors much better.

@OwenGrady it's a bummer that you have the outlook you have on eskates. You think you know best, but your ignoring the fact that corporations have bottom lines, which is money. DYI companies also have bottom lines, improving technology and offering the best possible tech to their customers. and that is what @onloop has done.

Here's my story I was sitting in my coach one day and And I say to myself it would be cool to ride an electric skateboard! So I start googling for an electric skateboard . (Now at the time im not a DIY guy ) so after searching the Internet I found 2 companies BB and Evolve ! And the rest was DIY company but i have no idea what a vesc is lol ?? !!!!! So I decide to go with The easiest solution Evolve !! And my experience was great and that was the start for me !! So one day I was riding my Evolve skate and I thought it would be cool to go faster, and that's how I start my journey in to DIY !! And this is the video that start me in .https://youtu.be/Fm-0SgVSyD8 

 To be honest  DIY will be always be superior to pre-build electric skateboard , the thing is that hobby it's a real time consuming and I work full-time!! so for me at the beginning I just wanted to ride a  electric skateboard so thanks to Evolve !!! Now I'm in to DIY !!  Real talk

They aren't the same.

As @onloop pointed out, Evolve motors are sensored and as such, would have a motor controller to suit.

From what I've seen/found, mass produced, widely available Chinese out-runner motors are all unsensored.

Side note though, sweet work on the fastest skateboard test.

Also @onloop , I'm confused about the link you say you can buy Evolve's set-up from? I don't see anything in that ad. that is Evolve? 
Different motor (un-sensored therefore presuming different controller), different struts, different wheels, different remote.

What of Evolve's do you think you could buy through that?

The motor gears do have flanges, albeit smaller than previous.
Their Facebook page has a better video showing the motors.

Hey everyone!
This is my first post and I just stumbled upon this forum by reading this thread.
Greetings from Germany first of all.
I am looking for help, which board to buy as my first one. 
I am in a situation where I dont have any experiences with esk8s yet but really want to start. Currently I dont really have the time to DIY but I am sure once I started riding for a bit, Im in for a talk ;-)
Right now I am waiting for the new evolve board because evolve is one of the few companies that I am interested in which ship to Germany. 
What are your thoughts on it? I got the money and am worrying less about price... Just want to start riding asap ;-))
Thanks for helping out and I love to be part of this community any time soon!

Hallo Djupex,

Keep in mind that this is not the new version of the evolve.

If you read the rest of the blog, you can see that the guy is heavily into DIY also.
He is a member of various DIY e-longboard  forums and has his own.
This will give you a good balanced view of the board.

Lol, neat find: `'event', 'preorder'`

Something must be coming then :slight_smile:, good for BB.

I still think that DIY is better for somebody that has some time to spare and willing to learn, it's fun, it gives satisfactory results if done right, and it's not super-hard to do if you stick to the basics, but not everybody want to go the DIY route. Sometimes people just wants a ready-to-ride product and that's it, but if the product doesn't arrive in time or doesn't meet their expectations then a part of them will go DIY as well I think. 
At least that's what happened to me, I ordered the [Bolt] last year (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bolt-the-world-s-most-portable-electric-vehicle#/comments) (that is now late few months lol, as usual :D) mostly because I wanted a small portable board to do the home-work-home commute (I think that an electric skateboard is **revolutionary** for that, it's even lighter than a moped), but then, few months ago I was tired of waiting, I was daydreaming about riding my future board a lot already and went to the DIY route, learned some lessons at first but I was and I'm very happy, I'm a bit obsessed with it (it happens to me with all the cool things, I'm now waiting to try a VESC next week, to learn how to do a custom battery pack, and wanting to make more videos!)... my gf and my wallet are less happy lol but whathever ^^ 

edit: sorry cuz I wrote too much and I'm a bit OT

Building your own Professional Grade, High-powered electric skateboard has never been easier.... I have spent the last 3 years trying to simplify the process so that anyone can do it.

This video is a demonstration of what is possible at home with limited tools.

So good news and bad news.

Yes I've been following the Evolve video releases, yes they have just released another.

Bad news, is they still haven't really released any specs, like at all.

The video doesn't show any more board wise, but it does show wheel options.
Looks like they've confirmed not only basic street and off road options, but multiple street wheel options. 
In the video description they state all the wheels fit on the same axle. So assuming a matter of changing just wheels then.

Also says full details coming May 25. Still a bit of a wait, but at least a date.

Looks like the 7-inch pneumatic is actually using 5mm pitch pulley.... ballsy move...

this video below i posted back in 2014 has 5mm pitch pulleys & 5.5inch pneumatic wheels... i eventually stopped using this system due to rocks getting caught in the belt. Evolve do have a cover over the motor pulley but there is still a big gap between the wheel pulley & motor pulley...

Overall though i think the drive train looks good, having the machined step for the pulley bearing is smart.

They say 3000W dual Brushless motor system with lithion ion battery (which I'm pretty sure they already use)

Looks good in real life as well. Didnt a chance to ride it yet though. Still another 2 weeks or more before official release. Sits really low. It will look alot better once hub motors get better, its probably the only thing detracting the look of this package. Current Evolve owners are going to go ballistic over this.

@E-Boarding I doubt you can even walk up a 45% incline. Usually, inclines this steep will have stairs on the side. At least, here in SF.

however the customer does get a lot more for their money.

Likely $1800+ w/o the wheel package going by this...I'll wait lol..

24mph for ~30 miles while only weighing 2 more pounds than a d+ is pretty impressive. Would like to see the torque compared to the raptor dual....if its better (or even just as good), the non-diy market is about to get serious.

They used a weight sensor that disables the board if there is nobody standing on it, great addition. I think I see a little bit of drop in the deck shape, which is a huge improvement over the old design.This thing looks awesome! If they sell their pneumatic wheels separately, I'd give them a try.

But I bet it doesn't have FOC mode :slight_smile:

Being that summer is near yup, I see people spending near 2k for the d+ because the website is sold out -- not realizing that 1) Boosted is still taking orders 2) a new model is coming out and 3) this board will shit all over it

As DIY parts improve and expand, more people will be inclined to just make their own..

Yea no Foc probably and slow.  Whenever I come across one or a boosted, on a flat or any hill, they look cool but I can't help flying by at double the speed to show them what a diy will do.  Way way better.  I rode the evolve and boosted.  A lot of the owners have no idea how much stronger and faster diy can be.  Marketing.  If they just sold the deck...wish someone just sold a nice carbon deck with a good compartment

What keeps me away from making budget DIY builds is I actually need to use these things for daily commuting, not recreation (although I would). To try to use your first DIY build as a legitimate commuting vehicle is a big risk. It runs the possibility of breaking down easier or at the worst possible time compared to completes made by companies which have tested all their parts for years.

I think the DIY community will always consist of mostly engineer type folks that were already into building stuff not related to esk8. Those type of folks are the ones that can make quality builds that don't break down or look like s#!7. I want something that doesn't look like s#!7 and completes are my best bet at the moment.

I don't own an evolve, but when I was first looking I had a chance to ride one. 
Same kind of truck set up on current models. With the right adjustment I actually felt pretty stable at 35-37km/h. 
I completely agree with you about needing a board with reliability and doesn't look crap. I still would like to build a board in near future, however looking to prob buy one first as very little free time for building.

I think @Ermac-514 has an evolve of some sort?  opinions on trucks?

I ran my evolve carbon with custom liion battery for more than 2000km. loved the trucks at first (after putting lots of work into bushings), then I went to ride more with calibers and started to dislike the wobbly sidewinders more and more.

they make a very large board like the original carbon quite agile though, it becomes a snappy lively feeling when carving hard ... which suits the carbon very well. it also dampens the road quite well with the dual kingpins.

I really think everyone should move away from Lithium Ion and just go A123 cells. Those 1,000 cycle life cells are amazing compared to a Lithium Ion pack (although bigger) in size.

Evolve had to go with outrunners.. They would have been outdated if they hadn't. They had to go two motors.. Why wouldn't/shouldn't they anyways.

As for commuting DIY will always be better IMO. Evolve's current setup I don't think will climb hills. This one should be fine but it won't be the best.

According to the site, the Carbon GT will climb "25 degree gradient hills" though I'm sure they meant 25% which is still fairly respectable.

[/quote]

which A123 cells? Thier 18650s are lifepo4 apparently, their 26650s are lithium ion, or so the site says, but its some nanophosphate thing and they say it has 10X the cycle life. But they also only have a nominal voltage of 3.3v and a lower mah rating and discharge rating than the sammy INRs .. and they're waaaay more expensive. ITs kind of a tough call to go with them, and i'm having a tough time making the case for them in my head at the moment. 

i just bought 50 sammy INR18650-25R cells for $242 tax and shipping included. I'm trying to find out how much 50 of those A123 18650s would be. A guy brought a solar powered rig by my shop not too long ago with 12 of those 26650s and i wish i could recall exactly what he paid, but it was somewhere close to that.

They need to come down in price and come up in discharge performance. Then they will have me.

What I meant by the commuting comment was really that something I (a potential DIY builder) would make is more likely to break down than something a reputable company (Evolve) would make. Add in the fact that I'd have a warranty and could just ship the board to get fixed no problem/no time spent testing things and it becomes practical for the average person who has a 9-5 and other priorities than messing with what's supposed to (or should) be a reliable commuting vehicle.

As far as the power, they did mention that it climbs 25% grade hills..
> Firstly, the dual brushless motors power the board up insanely steep hills of up to 25 degree gradient with ease.

Which would basically make this board a slightly faster/better looking/heavier  d+ with nearly 9 times the range. Perfect. 

Yes, DIY builds have more power and can be customized, but not every person that wants to get into esk8 can make something better than the carbon for a first or even second build. If they could, they should probably be selling completes themselves lol

As crazy as it sounds, I may be getting this in *addition* to the Raptor...or more specifically until the Raptor comes so I can review it, then against the Raptor, make the decision and sell the loser lol. 

Boosted hasn't dropped their info yet so they have a LOTTTT of catching up to do if they are gonna beat this. Only thing is this is definitely the most expensive board...which if the Boosted is cheaper I might just go with them instead if the boards are at least comparable.

Exactly, its just scary how well Evolve did with this. Only thing is it hasn't been tested by the public yet, so no telling how this will compare to anything unless they are smart and gave these boards to some tech reviewers already (that will make a video). I also don't know how good their CS is either... 

Evolve's policy: 7 day money back guarantee, 6 month warranty (with the exception that after 7 days you pay for shipping initially, and if its manufacture defect they ship back free)..not bad but Boosted is always more forgiving plus they're in the US which helps. We shall see.

Whenever there is a legitimate threat, they delete. They seem to always delete evolve threads quickly. But never Inboard. This only confirms that the Evolve has probably won...

I'm calling it man, Boosted will be overshadowed by this. I seriously can't imagine anything they could possibly do to compete at this point...

The beta versions of these boards went to some previous loyal evolve owners for testing and feedback. I can tell you to wait still the first prodction versions is out for sometime before you hit any trigger. Wait for some customer feedback and reviews. Anyone that has an order for Raptor Dual  have nothing to worry about, but the GT would be a nice second board. Looks like the deck has a removable lid. Mm whos done that. Now if you can hot swap a battery that would be handy. Oh I can already do that with the Raptor as well.

Ya, I have to agree with you. Its a little too early to say whether Evolve will overtake Boosted or Inboard, their market share of eskate industry is pretty vast and they have a lot of pull when it comes to customers loyalty.The general market tend to stick with their first choice as long as the company is reliable, in this case, BB. @Mr_Mahal I suggest waiting until all the second gen eskate is out to decide whether or not to pull the trigger. Also gives the company to work out the kinks.
(Edit: Apology, just re-read your post and realized you meant specs. In that case, you're right!)

Also @Dedbny , how are you able to swap battery for the Raptor? I thought the lid has 12 screws for the 1st batch. The more I read your reviews, the more anxious I am at getting my Raptor, gonna chew out the hills around my area for days.

Thing is, if the new Boosted is shitty compared to this it will likely be my only go while I wait for my Raptor. If the evolve  sucks I can return it or sell pretty easily. You guys were first batch for the raptor and got your problems fixed. With a big company like Evolve I highly doubt they couldn't get any issues fixed just as easily. Plus, I get to make quality reviews that many of these boards (except BB) don't seem to have in good supply.

No doubt the raptor is a beast and pretty much nullify's the need for this, but Evolve is less diy and probably a bit more reliable. Plus, 30 mile range means no need to hot swap shit, I could do an entire day of riding and still have juice. Two different boards two different purposes/markets.

Inboard is done in my eyes, ever since I saw the specs and video evidence of hill climb. It is weak, and personally I want nothing to do with it. They are also not as established as any of their competitors, big risk to take going with them compared to Evolve...

As far as Boosted vs Evolve I will wait for BB to announce, but in reality I have a strong feeling BB will come up short. Doesn't matter if the BB is more reliable if the specs/other things are rubbish. I would get a used d+ for $1000 if I cared about just having a working board, but I want more than that..

You have to take the screws out. I've replaced with shorter screws. Its not going to take you 5mins, but you can swap battery and keep going unlke the Boosted at moment. The claimed 30mile range needs to be verified in real world conditions. Unles they have increased the battery size. How can they get the extra range compared to their carbon and this GT has 2 motors. Is that 30miles on energy saving mode. Test that someone when the GT is out.

@Nate bombing up hills is the best part of the Raptor, but it will chew up juice in the battery. Thats ok go down hill and regenerate the battery.

Evolve will have to reduce their older stocks. If they have good accountants, they'll probably suggest price cuts soon. Unless they're going the Apple and Boosted route having stopped production of the older generation already.

The original carbon Evolve was a bit or a monster in terms of weight and length. The Gt appears as though it's at least as long? 

I for one place this form factor as been too big to be convenient. At least if you were to say skate to the supermarket to pick up some bread, you would be welding a pretty hefty meat axe around the isle with you. When I had the Bamboo Evolve, that was the only deal breaker for me. I wonder if BB will be heading down that road... Smaller more convenient?

they do have a more muffled sound to them, its true. And in my opinion they feel better, but they're also heavier, so you have to balance your wants and needs. Do i mind carrying an extra 3ish pounds of deck when walking with it if it means i can have a more organic feel and a more muffled skate noise when riding it? That's really the question. Some people don't care and just want that carbon. It is really pretty, and some people like the way carbon rides.

Couldn't agree more. In that leaked review they said:

That last part is super important. I'm just excited they really stepped up to the plate, and whatever comes after this...well it better be pretty damn good.

Overall, I have no idea how I'll like/hate the carbon feel of the board if I do end up going with this. All I can say is I will definitely put it to the test in those 7 days -- if I don't like it, back in the box it goes.

Ahhh I'll have to wait to see what Boosted has before I decide...the review was a bit iffy as they seemed to not really test the top speed and mainly stayed on the all terrain wheels which gave them ~22mph and couldnt give any exacts on its ability to hill climb. They did show some decent footage of it though -- but none with the street wheels -_-

Review focused too much on the all terrain aspect of it.  But the torque is definitely there...if it can go up hills on grass and un paved road... Streets won't be an issue.  I wish they would have tested the actual top sustainable speed to see if it got to the claimed 26 mph.  

That price though....damn.

At least its out there I guess for those that want to know. Hopefully more will pop up on/after official release day. I'm sure that can't be it...It is good to see it powering those AT wheels up hills though, that does mean it is pretty powerful. 

I'm sure it can hit 26mph, 35kmh is the low end of the top speed which is actually what Evolve advertised in their FB post, so now we know that slowest we can expect is that. After seeing this comment:

>**The top speed is listed as 43 km/h** (26.7 mph) on *street* wheels and though **we didn't quite reach that mark on either setup**, the board took us to around the 35 km/h mark (21.7 mph) with consummate ease.

Edit: after re-reading that it seems like its 21.7mph all around?! Seems off, thats a huge difference if they are saying with the biggest street wheels they couldn't get more than 21.7.

Logically yeah it probably is I guess. I don't know which one will give the advertised speed, but they gave a range of 35-42 and one of the street wheels should at least be able to hit 40...thats all im concerned about. AT wheels are cool but if I'm gonna ride this to work I cant have those AT wheels on.

Either way that kind of grade of hill is insane for a board, I'm sure a lot of these claims are mixing up grade and degrees.

That is a huge difference in speed from what they claim. Maybe they don't think anyone can convert to mph.   I forget the law even here in California, but wouldn't 26 mph be stepping over some legal line?  They're into diy territory.  


I just had another encounter with an evolve board and it summed up the diy vs commercial board debate in a nutshell:
I see him ahead hunt him down and fly by and then end up on the side of the road fixing my board while he goes by slowly!

After rereading *again* I saw this bit:

> The street wheels can be swapped over for off-road tires when the rider is headed for rougher terrain, but this time around Evolve has made that process a little easier. It mightn't sound like much, but both types of wheel work with the same trucks, or hangers, meaning you won't need to swap those over in addition to the wheels and belt. **All up, a tire-change pitstop took us under 10 minutes. With the street wheels attached, the GT not only goes faster, handles better and just feels smoother to ride, it will also go much further with each charge.**

This seems to suggest that the street wheels indeed will give you the higher end of the advertised speed, despite their conflicting statement near the end. We will see, but it only make sense considering the board has to work harder to power the AT wheels and is practically pushing it to its limits -- hence why the range is reduced with them on.

Why wouldn't the bigger wheels go faster?  Maybe I'm thinking from a diy perspective but bigger wheel given the same motor..  Maybe the whole board is amp limited something low. Regardless of how powerful it really is, and I'm betting not that powerful considering the last version, it's a fantastic looking machine.  I really just want the deck. 

But two pulley wheels is mechanically inefficient and wouldn't do it for that reason. I'm sure there's a sexy enough hub motor out there that could go with that deck. They must be the longest board

Idk dude, we will have to see, technically I guess if you let the board coast with the AT wheels it could go faster downhill but I think its more about being able to sustain speed that takes more work than with the street wheels -- right? The settings do change depending on what mm wheel you choose on the remote, so there is some limiting going on I think.

I'm not that well versed as to why hub or pulley wheels are good/bad but can hub motors produce more torque than a belt driven system? What about wheel size -- what would thinner hub motor wheels feel like on rough roads?

Going slower on AT wheels makes sense to me. The wheel pulley is much larger which increases the ratio between it and the motor pulley meaning less rotations of the wheel per rotation of the motor.

Any board with enough momentum should have been able to get up that short hill with pneumatics.

The top speed would be with street wheels and the greater distance with pneumatics in my opinion as the wheels would roll better.

"The top speed is listed as 43 km/h (26.7 mph) on street wheels and though we didn't quite reach that mark on either setup, the board took us to around the 35 km/h mark (21.7 mph) with consummate ease."

35km/hr is nowhere near claimed 45km/hr. I can easily get to 40-45km/km. Dont see why they would make these claims if it can be easily be debunked.

And once again the mileage is yet to be proven. l would say depending on the rider it would at least be 5-10km below the claimed distances. Having said that it would be amazing to get 40-45km range if it is in fact correct. Not hard test this either.

Of course the range will vary. I don't expect to get exactly 30 miles on this thing -- mainly because I don't ride conservatively. I don't need 30 miles, but what it does mean is that if I push it to its limits 24/7 I still get 22+ miles of range I wouldn't have gotten otherwise with other boards. All without having to swap one battery. 

As far as power goes, after looking at the vid again the hill wasn't very steep, true. We are yet to really see any good tests. All will come with time. Half of what was said in that review was confusing, and we saw no actually evidence that what they said was legit or specifically which wheel set they were testing it on. No need to jump to conclusions just yet.

The board I tested had the beta motors I believe, the production motors will be a little different. I didn't test the beta board back to back with the Raptor but I can say that it has plenty of power and torque, at least as much as my Boosted Dual Plus, and enough to keep me happy. According to specs the Raptor is more powerful again, but all the other advantages of the Evolve GT make it an easy decision for me as to which one I'd prefer. Remember this is just my opinion.

Is literally all I needed to hear :) by no means would I expect it to match the Raptor, due to the fact that the Raptor has bigger motors. But being at least as good as the d+ (or better) is enough to hold me for the summer, couple that with higher top speed and being able to go until my legs give out and I'm a happy camper.

I definitely will. I have lots of different conditions to test it in too :) I plan on doing some track/city tests such as:

1) How long can I go full throttle on / average power consumed per mile while hauling ass
2) Is it actually possible to get 30, if so how slow do I have to go
3) City flats and hilly suburbs tests -- including hill grade performance

And so much more as I figure out what else you guys want..this will take time as I don't really have a camera man, but my area is rich with a variety of conditions that can simulate how it would work for different riders.

Yeah, some people are hard to impress. Judging from what I've seen/heard from you and @Mickyboy, I'm sure the only thing I could possibly like/dislike is the feel of carbon deck coming from a flexible bamboo deck. But thats about it..

Since it looks like you will be among the first to get the production board, I think everyone (myself included) would love end the range/top speed quarrel. Mainly the speed though..

I asked evolve Australia if I can order from them and they say they cannot ship to canada here's the e-mail they sent me : ""Hi ermac514. As our business has grown, we have set up distributers around the world to allow service and warranty access to our customers. Part of this setup is an agreement that we can not ship to another distributers region, as it would be cutting into their business.

As Canada is in the USA region, I can not ship to that area sorry.
The only way to access one outside this would be to collect the board yourself and organise your own shipping.

Please be aware Evolve USA may refuse service and warranty on the new board if they do not have access to it, and also that you can not prove purchase with them. Please also note, as you reside away from our service region, you will be subject to shipping costs both ways if service concerns are required.

I know this is not a great result for you, unfortunately there is not much we can do to help until Evolve USA receives stock.

Lol it takes one video to convince me to get it, no need to do all the promo and then reveal only Australians get it first...we truly don't know what the deal will be as it is not the 25th of May and that is when they said those details would be revealed. If they from the beginning planned on releasing in Australia first for a few months they could've stated that. A lot of people will be quite angry if it misses the prime window for great riding conditions.

That is why I highly hiiiiiiighly doubt that is there plan. It does not make sense from a business standpoint to market the board with the implications that it will be available for anyone to order right at the beginning of summer -- only to reveal a limited release....really would be stupid. But hey, I guess I'll just be beardless for the summer if that's the case because I'm pretty sure the Boosted won't be worth it...

Saw this under the shipping tab on their website for the previous carbon series. This seems to be their international shipping policy, not sure if this will be how we get the boards if they plan on keeping the boards in Australia:

> INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: 

> International deliveries of electric skateboards are sent via Fedex and take approx. 2-6 days depending on your location.  Accessories are also sent via Fedex and take approx. 2 -6 days shipping.

> PLEASE NOTE: Some countries may have addition duties, taxes or other charges applied through customs. We do not cover those costs and advise that you contact your country's customs office if you are unsure of what they may be.

> If your country isn't listed please contact us for pricing.

> Prices are in $AUD and shipping is applied to your order at the END of the checkout process once you've entered your address.

> Please note the prices below include a $105 Dangerous Goods Fedex fee due to sending lithium batteries internationally.

> Shipping rates for Electric Skateboards via Fedex
> Zone C	Japan	$285
> Zone D	US, Canada	$380
> Zone E	France, UK, Germany	$380
> Zone F	Brazil	$450
> Zone G	UAE	$495

That would likely cost quite a lot and not sure who I would trust with nearly 2 grand...lol. I forgot the name of one company that supposedly buys stuff for you and you have to meet them at the border. That seems expensive as well though..not quite the same as doing US to Canada. 

I don't know anybody in Australia that could do it. We will see as the verdict is not out yet as to what their plans are. The people at Evolve USA could've been misinformed or not know themselves and just lowering expectations. If they do not ship worldwide day 1 (or at least before mid summer), I'm telling you they will fail hard. Boosted will release some random board that might be marginally better (than their previous model) and take all the US/Canada sales just cause its all they've got to choose from. I don't think they want that to happen.

Why would they hype this up if they know they can't deliver? They are a big company, been doing it for years. This is not even a first gen product. To do that would be really stupid. I can understand if something delayed them but what I wouldn't understand is why they wouldn't let people know that sales will be limited to their country on initial launch when they gave us all these specs and video coverage to get us excited. 

This is what was said in that good design review:

> Our GT releases early May 2016. We have already made and sold 1000 being **shipped in April to our distributors around the world.**

After rereading that it seems they may be over a deadline they set intially now...idk...no one knows...but they've agreed to release these details on specific dates in which they should have their shit together.

@Michaelinvegas I'm getting skeptical whether they can ship to US anytime soon. They're probably running into problem with getting permits shipping the battery pass customs. And 2k is a hell of a steep price to justify investing in GT with only 6 months of warranty.

I'm not going to lie though, I really hope those stats are true after seeing that hill video. Looking forward to more infos on the 25th.

Well 2k is the price you pay for the state of the art pre-built shread stick.  It's still a skateboard ... The automation stopped at the board and wheels...it's still takes time to put that together by hand...and I'm sure it don't take 15 minutes like @onloop's video.... So 2k....for the Cadillac of Electric Longboards? How much is a shit eating grin worth to you?

That hill climb test is interesting. 

I'm in Australia so hoping to fight for one early. Or at least the chance to test out myself. 

Interested to see what Boosted do put out, but as it's been said, it would have a lot of catching up to do. In contrast to Evolve I'd also expect it would be released in USA initially. 

I just really like the whole set up. Wheel options etc.

Yeah, obviously there is a bit of weight out the back with the twin motors, but it doesn't feel as rear heavy as the big heavy block of a motor on the old carbon. Also the underside of the board looks and feels beautiful. A top mounted battery and electrics is a great improvement.

In total it would come out to $2,084 AUD or $1536 USD... consider that the price for the street GT may be raised only $100 or so and it should only be ~$1600 USD in total...or am I missing something?

No problem. As far as I see it here are the Pros and Cons of both Evolve and Enertion's top offerings (based off what I've seen/heard):

**Raptor Dual**

Pros
- King of torque, flys up hill like they don't exist
- Highest top speed out of every commercially available board
- Swappable, long lasting battery
- Customizable to no end 
- Relatively light, 1 more pound than a d+
- Kicktail....enough said. 

Cons
- Some report it does not feel like a longboard, but more like a platform (hoverboard? lol)
- Fast charger has a noisy fan
- Not great for low speed cruising 
- Not beginner friendly

**Evolve GT**

Pros
- Longest range of any board available (except metroboard, but it is nearly 23 f*** pounds!!) 
- High top speed
- Can take 25%+ grade hills like a bo$$
- Sexy as fuck
- Ability to switch between AT and street wheels
- Remote LCD with trip distance/speed/battery percentage and voltage
- Gullwing trucks, carving heaven

Cons
- Still a bit heavy, 17lbs
- Fast charger takes 3 hours...although you will likely not need to do more than 1 charge lol

Of course, we don't know everything about the GT yet, but basically it comes down to this: **are you a speed demon or a commuter?**

They are Australian based, no? I think they might also have gotten that price from the carbon 2 in 1 board (previous model). It is a bit confusing as they left out a lot of specifics in general... Prices will fluctuate between countries which why they are still working out the final price and will release on the 25th. They didn't seem to be direct quoting (in the Gizmag article), where as the good design article was, seemingly -- they (Evolve) said (in the good design article) that it will be a little bit more than the current model. I believe that little bit is maybe $100 or so.

An Australian blogger with connects to Evolve also said they will be coming out with a bamboo version of this board soon as well...so basically we don't know shit yet and I'd take that gizmag review with a grain of salt as they did a pretty bad job all around and probably had a lot of misinformation.

Just reread, they did actually say that, my bad.

> At US$1,950 it is a mightily expensive toy,

At the same time though, that is the exact price of the current most expensive board (package basically) in the series:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5f975d804d3973326bdf686740a714559d687eb2.png" width="690" height="122">

So I'm wondering if there is a street version that is the same price as the current carbon street or slightly ($100) more. They were not specific on what the entire set up included and if that was the only package you could get.

I had the sidewinders and for me they were a disappointment. Maybe it was the flexy deck that added to the problem but past 20mph I didn't like them. 
The deck looks like a longer bustin sportster carbon. Same as mine. And the long trucks look like my Paris 195s on it.  too bad u can't put other trucks on the board.  I don't think

2000$!  That's almost triple the cost of my board.  Can't wait to see them on the street and maybe have some competition

You can always replace front trucks generally speaking..well with this you probably can't for the AT wheels I guess. 

Have you tried messing around with different bushings? Trucks contribute to handling but bushings ultimately control how sensitive the truck is to pressure and how much rebound you get etc.

No I moved on after trying them either loose or tight. I didn't have a chance to get to a high speed on the evolve I rode and maybe it's good.  They should make a different mount for different trucks. Not many people ride them to begin with and that's all they have

You'd be surprised the difference it can make. I do agree different trucks would be cool. I found on the BB I could get just about the right amount of turn by switching the bushings, but the calibers in general were way too stiff and just got in the way so I switched it. 

The sidewinders are similar to the truck I replaced the calibers with in that it is very carvy by nature. And that is good, because it is easy to make it really stiff with hard bushings if thats what you're going for.

@Mr_Mahal It was gonna happen,  Can't really blame them.   Most newbies have no idea evolve even exists, they only have heard of boosted.  So seeing another better board on that sub is not in the best interest of boosted.  Strangely, I was talking about inboard M1 a lot but mostly about how hub motors just won't have the torque to compete with boosted... and they had no problem with that.

Hey dude, I meant no disrespect. I simply did not like the idea that a company that is known for being the only one to offer worldwide shipping for esk8's would market a product to everyone only to say "Oh sorry, we're only releasing it locally. You guys can have a try next year." 

I understand that you guys have to wait very long for a lot of things. I wouldn't care if they waited two years before they started shipping this worldwide. The problem was they got me heavily intrigued and could've made me even cancel an order on another board or wait until this one was released to buy an esk8 -- there are people worldwide that *waited* for this to be announced and held off on going to the competition because they believe they will be able to get this. And the simple fact is that the weather for most people is only good for a few months a year. So no, its not the end of the world if I don't get it. It's just that if it gets released to everyone in the winter it won't be of any use to me -- so I would get a different board.

At the end of the day, whatever happens on the 25th happens. I'm not going to have a mental breakdown if what the rep above told me isn't true, I'll just be disappointed and move on.

@Photorph Yup, that's just how it is. I was glad it got a shit ton of exposure before it got taken down though. On a weekday it would've went down fast. Now most people know it exists and will be comparing it against whatever BB comes out with which is exactly how it should be. 

I did appreciate that they made a thread saying how they moderate. That's all I wanted. Don't just go around deleting stuff and not explain precisely why you did it. Even still, going from what you're saying they still bend the rules of course which is why I don't support Boosted. I just replied to that thread with an interesting observation illustrating this as well. Jason embraces his competition and knows that it only makes esk8 better -- thats why I'm keeping my order on the Raptor.

Overall, I really impressed with this board. Litterally the best board out their in my opinion with the raptor in second place. Sorry Enertion ;( but Im sure he will be making a board with better specs soon to compete with this. Apparently the gt carbon has 50 km range whereas the raptor has only 30 km but the raptor is a little faster by 5 km. Wow them motors must be energy efficient!

This was already posted, the video is not quite fair and likely misrepresented the dual+'s ability to climb hills. However, the Evolve did exceptionally well and it looks like it can easily handle steeper hills which is great. 

I would not go as far as to rate these boards as 1st 2nd 3rd but rather look into what problem they are trying to solve. Enertion is solving the problem for some that want more power in a board -- but don't want to go full DIY because they want a quality, tested, and uniquely designed board with a warranty. Boosted is solving the last mile issue for commuters in Cali that need something relatively light and comfy to ride and get up really steep hills -- but don't need to go far. 

Evolve however lies in the middle. It is not the fastest board out. It does not climb hills as good or better than a raptor. It is not the lightest board either. But it combines what Evolve is know best for (range) and all of the competitions strengths in lesser forms to make the ultimate commuter board for everyone. That being said, I like to go fast and for long distances, so I will be getting both :)

Sorry for the misleading info. I should have specified that the list I made was for my needs. I live in a very flat area so I value range most of all and speed second. So for my purposes its is the best electric board on the market. However it is far out of my price range and I already have my own custom board which I can easily add more batteries too for more range. So I will stick with my own board until something better comes out. With that stated I favor Enertion out of all electric skateboard companies, so it will probs been one of their boards.

It's all good, I believe no board can do everything well at once so everyone just goes with what serves them best. If you're on mostly flats, I'm sure you will save a lot a money since you should only need mono drive, lucky you lol : p I can only imagine what a mono version of the GT would be with the new battery set up they have going. Probably quite a bit more miles.

I get what you're saying, and for me it comes down to ride. 
Yes I want it to be quick off the mark, and maybe some decent top speed, but if you can't carve, it loses something imo. 
I have ridden an older fiik, wasn't much of a fan.
Have had a quick play on a boosted. Not fond of thumb throttle. 
Have ridden a bamboo evolve and actually enjoyed the carve it gave. 
I have some snowboarding background and so anything I can get a nice carve and semi similar feel  from I'll like. 
Fast straight line is fun, but without carving I think I'd get over it. 
I know other boards don't run sensored motors and have heard the raptor isn't great at low speed/s cruising??
In all honesty, as a regular cyclist, I think the steepest gradient I've ridden is 22% and I know that's freaking hard pushing. 
There's people commenting on the YouTube video saying they're going to do same test themselves. Interested to see how they go. 26% is steep. Not really planning this riding, but knowing it has the torque is cool. 
I'm liking the interchangeable wheel options with a wide variety to use. No modification of wheels or specific wheels required from what I understand. Can rotate wheels to keep wear even I guess. 
At the end of the day you are all right and it comes down to what people want out if the board. 
For me it's an overall experience. I want the power there when I want it, I want it to be fun, I like the idea of carving off road and I like the idea of being as close to snowboarding as possible without actually doing it. 
Like many on here, I look at DIY options, but also liking the idea of buying something ready to go that could fit the bill. 

The release date can't come soon enough. I'm in Australia so hoping can get access to try one asap.

@Mr_Mahal if you order the evolve you will likely be the only person with both raptor and evolve, so definitely do a video.  I wish I could order the evolve GT as well, but I already have a raptor on order and I can't spend any more on E-boards.  

One thing that I like about the raptor is the kick tail.  It was so awkward to make sharp 90 degree turns with the boosted, having to get off and move the board... no problem with the raptor or any board with a kick tail.  

But having both those boards...man you are LUCKY to be 20 and to be able to get both of them.  That's the best of everything.  Going off road with the AT wheels on the evolve just sounds like a blast too, you can plow through grass.

I agree 100% with the kick tail part. The Raptor is also a little bit shorter which will make it a bit easier to carry around in a crowded area. I'm just getting into electric skateboards and I'm still looking for one. I am currently using an electric unicycle (ninebot one e+) and I can turn on a dime and even do 360 spins on it which is why the kick tail feature is something I like. I'm not worried about weight at all because my unicyle is over 30 lbs =( The raptor seems like it is very hard to get a hold of, or at least have a really long wait time.

Maybe I haven't ridden enough skateboards yet, but carving ability for me had more to do with my truck/bushing set up rather than the material of my deck. The Boosted has a bamboo deck as well, but it has little to do with how easily I can carve. I guess feel is subjective, but I barely stood in the middle of my deck where I could actually feel the flex so it wasn't very useful unless I was going slow in a straight line. That being said, the caliber II's on the BB are HORRIBLE for carving lol I had to switch to Carver CX trucks which have a really narrow wheelbase but are just like the sidewinders on the Evolve -- except more stable even while being loose. The rebound (how quickly you return to center) was insane.

I guarantee you could still get that surfy feel no matter what eboard you have as long as you can switch the truck and upgrade the bushings, it makes such a huge difference. What Evolve has done is put one of the most surfy trucks out there on an esk8, making the ride right out of the box feel smooth as hell. You can do this on any board though.

People can test all they want, really wish it was just the Evolve going up a hill, because that is all that mattered. The Evolve went up that hill like no ones business, and that was exciting to watch.

I'm sure the Raptor can be ridden like a bamboo if you want it to, its just because of the torque and speed keeping the trucks loose would be a nightmare when going fast. I can handle loose trucks at 20mph, but at 25-28 I think I'd fear for my life. That being said, I honestly think the carbon would work fine for you. But they are coming out with a bamboo version as well, so maybe that would suit you better.

It's not so much the bamboo deck, but as you said, the trucks. The evolve trucks which have the truck arm/dual pivot. The evolve bamboo is just what I had the chance to have a ride on. But it's similar wheel base to new board and similar trucks. 

I agree with you, the evolve on its own up that Hill would have been enough haha. 

In all honesty, I'm hoping to jump at the evolve when I can, while still looking at possibly a slow DIY on side. 
I don't mind a slightly longer board as stance is closer to snowboard set up.

Of course, one of my main reasons (besides getting an eboard asap) was to do reviews/tests on it against the raptor. Originally, it was just gonna be the raptor vs the d+ (which would've been useless), then it was gonna be the new version (but then the evolve announced), and now it is this lol.

As far as I'm concerned, the Evolve is a slightly punchier board than the d+ (on paper) so comparing it to a Raptor should pretty much sum up the difference between all boards in that spec range in terms of power -- which should be useful. I got over the d+'s low maneuverability by switching the front truck. I can't exactly make 90 degree turns, but I never have to slow down to make an adjustment. Not exactly sure what using the kicktail for those turns would look like in traffic. 

This is not easy for me financially but right now I am losing out on opportunities to do things I've really wanted to do which are: grow my youtube channel more (at 225 subs now, would get more exposure since the board is new), tour DC more for photography (bike riding is not fun), and try commuting from home to work without any public transportation (would save a lot of money daily). Those are all big goals and worth the financial risk in my opinion as they could all pay off for me in the long run. That being said, I might sell one after I've compared them both and seen how they fit into my lifestyle. Hell, I might even try out whatever Boosted has if it turns out to be worth a try. 

AT wheels will take my riding to another level entirely. In DC sidewalks during the summer are PACKED. Around the national mall there is a lot of open grass, and a lot of stony sidewalks that are really shitty to ride on with street wheels. I would be able to plow through all the grass areas and go over rough pavement with ease -- definitely looking forward to it. 

@Ermac-514 If it turns out the 2k version includes everything, I will have both and do testing. I believe getting accurate top speed, torque, etc for all wheel set ups will be very useful for everyone so I'd like to get it all if possible.

I'm really wondering what their bamboo version will look like. Considering how sexy that carbon is, coming from their old design, I'd be really interested to see what they could carve out (pun intended) with the bamboo. If I didn't have so many hills where I live, I'd just get a small board like the loaded truncated tesserate (I believe its called) for a DIY build to make short runs to the grocery store. But it is always an adventure whenever I try to get somewhere so I need power and dual motors.

Mr_Mahal, I did use the new remote but it wasn't fully functional yet so didn't use all features, basically just accelerate and brake. Felt in hand very much like the old one. To be honest I prefer the scroll mechanism of the Boosted remote as it allows more precision with acceleration and braking as opposed to a trigger which is a slightly more difficult movement for fine adjustment.  Certainly not a deal breaker though.

I see, I was concerned because I actually really like using my thumb to control throttle (I used to be a gamer, feels natural) and thought that using my index finger might be too odd. In that gizmag review they did say the throttle was really sensitive. But I guess in due time I would adjust to it. I can see myself spending the first 50 miles on a track going in circles until I feel confident enough to take it on the road lol Also looking forward to see how easily I can switch between reverse and accelerate.

I've used the Evolve index trigger remote for 2 yrs and find it intuitive. Like it even more after I found how weird and tiring it is to operate other thumb trigger or thumb dial remotes.

The new Evolve remote looks similar to the previous remote so expect the reverse feature is still the same. You'll need to use the thumb to push one of the buttons to switch to reverse so can't toggle forward and reverse in one stroke compared to thumb triggers. In my 3 years riding Evolve boards, Ive ever needed to switch into reverse and forward on a dime unless I'm doing 180 pendulum slides.

Sometimes they're looking for something to do.  I had a cop tell me electric boards aren't allowed on the street.  He's wrong of course but if he had known the law and was up on his lipos and series know-how he could've gotten me.  I'm trusting none of the cops know.  But the new evolve board claims a higher speed and more power.  It's written and if any cops knew the law...

Ya but esk8 is getting more mainstream and now there are kids riding it everywhere not giving any f**k to the law. Which really grinds my gear. That's just giving the fuzz more reason to ban it completely. They're already banning it on the West side highway bike route in NYC. I use to ride there all summer last year, some of the best ride of my ride was from that route. 

I'm telling you man, anytime something becomes popular, there'll be a few people who fuk it up for the rest of us. I'm getting worried that they'll just pass a law banning it here soon. Then again, this is NY, we're usually the last state to pass any law.

Idk man, its up to you. If I was in Cali like @Michaelinvegas said I'd just use common sense and ride responsibly especially when near law enforcement. Maybe if you're really afraid of getting fined then just transfer onto a sidewalk and walk into a coffee shop or just start kick pushing. I've never had a problem with law enforcement and I've passed plenty in multiple areas in different cities. Just wear safety gear, stay in the right most of the lane and I don't think they really give two shits, if they do, just get a dual+ as it is the only board left in the market that adheres to those silly rules.

Yeah Casey actually got stopped the other day (shown in his vlog today) and was about to get fined for $500, he will likely be the downfall for eboarding in your entire city. Combine his reckless riding with the fact he wears no safety gear and you have this big litter of new riders who copy him and will likely get themselves killed / ruin it for everyone.

Technically, if your read the California e-board law that was passed recently, they define what is an electric skateboard near the beginning as... 

"An “electrically motorized board” is any wheeled device that has a 
floorboard designed to be stood upon when riding that is not greater 
than 60 inches deep and 18 inches wide, is designed to transport only 
one person, and has an electric propulsion system averaging less than 1,000 
watts, the maximum speed of which, when powered solely by a propulsion 
system on a paved level surface, is no more than 20 miles per hour"

Basically, saying that if your board is capable of going more than 20 mph, it does not meet the definition of an "electric skateboard", but rather the old definition of a "motorized skateboard" (you can read on in the law, but it says what doesn't meet this definition is still a motorized skateboard), which this law also affirms is still illegal in California. So technically, the vast majority of e-boards, including practically every diy board, is not legal in California.

Now, It would be hard for a cop to prove your top speed, unless you buy a mass produced board which has their specs advertised online, like evolve.

I get the desire to ride, I get the inability to wait for the next and best, and my hats are off to evolve for finally stepping up to the plate and playing with the big boys. But I doubt their max range is even close to what they are saying. I think they are hyping it up, like every other e-board mass producer out there, to seem way better then it will be. I can go double that speed, with better range, for at least $500 less. Or match the torque with a higher top speed and better range for half the price.

Idk what you are looking for when buying (in my case, building) an e-board, but the 3 numbers that matter to me are torque, top speed, and range. It's hard to compare torque without spending a bunch of money, top speed is usually pretty accurate, but range is like the mpg rating of a car. I could run a board that I wouldn't trust to get me more than 5 miles on my normal route down hills, and get a range of 20 miles. The reality is, when you have 3 mile stretches of up hill, you aren't going to get close to the advertised range rating. So I would like to see the power ratings  (and capacity) of the battery, and the efficiency ratings of their electric system. Until I see that, I don't trust the range they are advertising, and my belief that they are fudging the range numbers makes me distrust any other claims they make about it.

And ... I'm from NYC ... What happened to the old saying, "Everything is legal ... Just as long as you don't get caught." Lol...

But seriously...yep have to agree with @Mr_Mahal...it's already started with the parks ban in NYC....riders in NY gotta keep a low profile in densely public areas...but they won't ...more and more will get caught riding dirty which really kills it for the ones that are responsible-ish. I get it's a public safety thing in our most densely populated city...and you know how NYers are sometimes...the joggers or  cyclists that think the path is theirs only ...I'm sure they ka-bitched to thier city council member or boro president how they can't enjoy the paths because all these crazy electric skateboarders are almost crashing or crashing into people and bikes...so on so forth .... 

What's the solution? IMO ... Keep a low profile...yeah ... You'll run into a police officer that's got a hard on for people having fun, but those I think are few.

Well then, doesn't matter what board we're on we're all fucked :) 

> Now, It would be hard for a cop to prove your top speed, unless you buy a mass produced board which has their specs advertised online, like evolve.

True, Boosted would be the most likely to be spotted and flag with their flamboyant orange wheels though. Couple that with the fact that I don't think any cop is out there researching boards so he can hunt all the ones that go over the speed limit down. At least in Boosted's case, you could theoretically change the entire deck/wheels and not have any type of branding or info. Can't say the same for Evolve, but as long as Casey never gets one they won't be popular enough for law enforcement to single it out. In my case, I've seen maybe one or two eboarders in my area. All of which are far less reckless than I am. So it wouldn't be a problem for me.

> I doubt their max range is even close to what they are saying. I think they are hyping it up, like every other e-board mass producer out there, to seem way better then it will be.

Generally speaking giving a solid number for range is pretty much by nature never going to be accurate because of the myriad of factors that go into determining range. Boosted claims 6 or 7 miles all the time but thats only in eco with no hills -- which is useless or very boring for most. So I expect to get 20-25 which is still WAY better than 3 or 4...

> I can go double that speed, with better range, for at least $500 less. Or match the torque with a higher top speed and better range for half the price.

Of course you can. You do realize they have to make a profit and provide a warranty right? There are limitless possibilities with DIY, but I prefer to stick to commercial boards since I don't trust my ability to build something reliable on my first go. It's easier to fix issues with the board as well because plenty of people have probably already had it before. Plus, having a warranty is nice. If I want more torque/speed I will use my Raptor -- which if you can beat with your build I fear for your life and safety lol. 

> I don't trust the range they are advertising, and my belief that they are fudging the range numbers makes me distrust any other claims they make about it.

@mr_mahal @michaelinvegas the west side highway ban is actually a little bit more complicated than that. Electric skateboard on the street is already illegal but nypd has a loose policy regarding it, don't cause trouble and they'll leave you alone. It's not the entire bike route of west side highway that ban it, it's the battery city park section that's the most enforced by parks police (in green uniforms). To understand why, you need to know that battery park city(bpc) is not a part of NYC. The property tax we paid living in bpc actually go straight back into battery park city funds rather than the NYC general funds. So the section of the lane along battery park city is jointly maintained AND enforced by bpc and NYC. 

Last year, bpc was ok with riders of electric skateboard on that route because hover board was all the hype and it only goes 7(?)mph. But a few weeks ago, joggers and cyclists living in bpc decided to complain about electric skateboard being a danger to pedestrian because some fuk*ng idiot decided to ride it on the designated pedestrian lane, which prompted bpc to crack down on electric skateboard. Which is bullshit because they're giving a more stringent enforcement due to a few kids fu*king up. 

My feelings regarding Casey Neistat is mix. Love his vlogs but he's a hypocrite. Last year when he got his first board he championed wearing a helmet. A few days later? He stopped wearing it cause it lowers the cool factor. On top of this I see kids imitating his vlogging style by recording themselves carrying their camera on one hand and holding the control with the other. I was shocked. You're going 20+ mph (NYC speed limit is 25 mph btw) and it takes 1 mistake to cause a life and death situation and you're there multi tasking on an eboard. When people idolize you, you have a responsibility to make sure they learn safety too. Especially kids watching his YouTube channel. 

 His new apartment is actually a few blocks from where I live in bpc, so I'm sure he's pretty pissed about the whole situation too. Ironic that he was one of the factors feeding into the problem. Seriously, people do some really dumb shit when they want to show off for camera.

What other non-DIY board is coming to market that is going to wipe the floor with the GT specs (if they are legit) by the time it hits the market? It is not about "features" for me. Simply put, the range they are advertising is highly appealing coming from 3.5-4.5 miles on a charge. I wouldn't care if I only got 10-15 miles (though I highly doubt it'd be that low). It'd still be better than what I had. This board isn't doing anything new in the esk8 world as a whole, but it is something that (if legit) will be far better than anything *commerically* available right now, and in the near future (unless another esk8 comes out of the blue). DIY builds by nature will always be ahead of the off-the-shelf boards -- just like PC games vs console. However if the board is real it will be all I need.

I think @mr_mahal is just a little excited about the gt, it looks really neat. He and I both lack the knowledge and time to build our own board so that's why the unknown part about gt is so mesmerizing to us. He's just more vocal about it.

With that said, I had planned on getting a gt myself when I assumed they'd release it the end of this month in the US. But now that the email by @jinra states that they'll release it in the fall, that deal is off the table. I'm not waiting to be beardless this summer.

@evoheyax  I noticed that you said your board can theoretically reach 66mph, would you be interested in doing some commission work? I NEED a board badly this summer and I'm thinking about commissioning someone to build a DIY board for me.

I feel personally that the raptor will be better than this board on every aspect, except battery life. But you can always swap raptor batteries out if you need more range, it's just a hassle and more money. Though I can't speak to some degree, I've never tried either. But I do look at a lot of numbers, and while numbers don't say everything, certain numbers like battery numbers can tell you a lot.

We could talk about it. It partly depends on where you live. Shipping batteries right now is extremely hard, unless your the manufacture, and even then...

I am investing quite some time and money this summer into pressing hollow core decks, very similar to ollin's board, but with concave and maybe even a drop down deck.

Either way, boards take time to build. Best bet if your on a time crunch would be to sell you a board with used parts, as the process of buying parts can take a month. I could cnc mill an enclosure if you have a specific deck in mind. and go from there. Send me a PM.

@evoheyax good thing I plan on ordering both to make a comparison :) Swappable batts will definitely be of good use to me but not having to swap at all would be pretty cool as well. Hopefully the specs they release will tell you whether or not its legit...

@Nate all the new boards I had seen prior to discovering the Raptor and this board were pretty boring and not very attractive in terms of offering what I really wanted...when I saw this it seemed too good to be true. Couple that with having no eboard (just sold my first 2 weeks ago) and I get a bit obsessive about getting another :)

Ya i'd definitely be down for that. I'm looking for an all weather hub motor board or at least 95% water resistant so that I can ride a short distance in the rain. I'm waiting for @EnertionSupport response on Raptors eta to decide whether to get another board now. I'lll either shoot you a pm or just create a new thread to see who can create the best blueprint or idea for the best all weather board after I get an answer from Enertion.

ahhh... I think we would all love an all weather water proof hub motor. But as far as I know, that hasn't been done. The issue is heat. You would want to seal up the hub from water, but you need vents for air flow or it will overheat super quick, especially being a hub motor. Technically, they are almost all water resistant. Motors generally don't care much about water. I've ridden my enertion r-spec motor in light rain many times, it eats it up and spits it right back out. Now there could be a build up of rust over time, and most importantly, the bearings will break due to rust first and formost. You would need a hub motor with ceramic bearings to solve that problem, then you would likely not have any issues. But you would also have to seal off any pcbs, like the speed controller and the receiver. The issue with that, is the speed controller needs some amount of air flow. Or it will over heat quickly. So there's a lot of problems to be solved with water proofing electric skateboards.

belts don't care as far as I know. But I always had issues with belts breaking too quickly.

The reality is, the technology is there to make a water resistant board. Motors generally don't care about water in the short run. But you won't get year after year of use if you drown your motor in water frequently.

Out of curiosity, what belts have you been using?

This is one thing i've been looking in to as well and seems Evolve use Gates belts? 

Evolve have been using sensored motors for years. From reviews it seems this helps greatly with slow speed riding, taking off from standing etc. Interested to get a ride and feel it.

As for figures, it's like fuel consumption figures when you're buying a vehicle. Some people will get them, and some won't. The variables can attribute to this greatly - rider weight, hills wind, wheels, riding surface whatever. 
Speaking with some people from the owners page, it seems people get pretty decent range out of the current models.
I'm interested to see what Boosted eventually bring out, but as someone said, they'd have a lot of catching up to do.
I believe Enertion said he was building something new? But still waiting on VESC's for his current stuff. 
He doesn't seem to be on he anymore except for support.

Every board has pro's and con's as @Mr_Mahal mentioned above. It's picking what best suits. For me, the GT as a package is looking pretty good.

I used to use enertion's belts. Now its hubs all the way, less maintenance, cleaner look, and easier to setup. 

about onloop, he left his own forum because he made a bunch of claims about how much better his stuff is then everyone else (its good stuff, there's no denying it), and everyone kept giving him shit and fighting with him (including me). If your going to make those kinds of claims, you need hard science to back you up, an he doesn't have it.

Sensored motors are great motors at low speed, but does nothing for mid to high speed. For this reason, most don't care about them. You can get the same results with a good kick push, and is also better for a belt and pulley system to do that.

With the VESC in FOC, you can get similar results without a sensor.

The big thing this GT board lacks in my opinion is stealth. Big motors, belt and pulley, and no FOC. When you look at the math, FOC is far better than BLDC, which all main brands are using.

Fuck...well lets hope they are all wrong....like I said before it would be really dumb for them to miss the window and no one wants to ride their board in the fucking winter lol I truly think there are details being missed....why would they short the USA branch...of all branches where they could sell them like hot cakes.. I guess @lowGuido and other boarders in Aussy will be blessed with this release :) 

On the plus side, I'm glad I never cancelled my Raptor order so I'll probably have it before I even have the Evolve!!! Lol that would really be something... Early fall would be nice.

@Rob.Endless I think if you go DIY you should definitely just get parts from someone on here..trying to assemble a board now could take months, not to mention that everything is probably back-ordered or out of stock. Really bad timing all around. 

If they do break my heart on the 25th I may break down and buy a used BB..maybe keep it so I can do an ultimate comparison video with the Raptor, GT, and D+, assuming BB doesn't release anything (because I don't think they actually will).

Interesting about the belts. I would expect Gates belts to be pretty decent as they're probably the most used  manufacturer for automotive belts.

My issue with hub motors is with being stuck with that wheel. I like the idea of being able swap wheels out and even chuck on offroad set-ups.

In honesty, I like the exposed motors of Evolve, Enertion and BB. just my opinion.

Honestly, you can put other wheels on them, you'd have to pour them from a mix, but the process is as simple as making jello. Or get rims cnc milled for you (Might not be a cheap option, but it's possible). You imagination is your limit.

Hubs are the lazy man (or beginner diy) option in my opinion. No need to assemble anything mechanically, which leaves just the electrical system. I've been thinking of selling kits for exactly this. It's like, the electric legos of e-boarding. I know the hurdles that are there. Tools are one, skills are another. Soldering is hard when you know little about it. It took me years to learn to solder well. Removing hurdles for beginners.

don't slip like belts may do
looks meaner

Yes, but you will need wide trucks to fit them on a dual rear. Dual diagonal would be fine on regular/narrow trucks. We have tested them at 10s and 12s but more testing needs to be done before we can advise using 12s.

Depending on your riding style you may get away with using a single if you use a heavily reduced gear ratio.

If I wasn't going to buy the Pro4 I'd make my own, but his enclosure and battery setup costs about $400 for DIY project so I'd rather order from someone who's been doing this for a while, compared to me who never built a battery pack before. He was back ordered on a bunch of parts but now that they're flowing in he may be able to get stuff shipped within a month (hopefully).

Yeah I definitely would love to just buy all of the stuff from Enertion but then I'd have a Raptor basically...which I already have on order lol 

Idk, I kinda want to go ahead an put in the order for chaka's motors / VESC but still hesitating due to the battery potentially not coming anytime soon...if it doesn't ship till end of june or july I might as well pre-order the carbon at that point. Based on how Jason's schedule is going, he just finished all of february's raptor orders, so at this pace he should technically be shipping mine in August which isn't horrible -- but definitely would build something in the meantime

@Mr_Mahal I gave up on finding info out and this thread.  I'm just waiting for May 25th to get the real info.... And now with the boosted board 2 being announced tomorrow, i think by end of May you can have a pretty solid idea of what complete board is best in market and which one you can actually get shipped.  Also lost hope of getting a raptor anytime soon, people who ordered in Feb are still not getting full shipping info (well some aren't at least).  I honestly thought I'd have a raptor this month since my shipping estimate was April.

Building your own is a great idea too, I'd have one complete from a big company to do commuting etc and build one as a hobby/fun project... And who knows, you might get good and end up building better boards than the commercial ones.

They put the heat on them because there are tons and tons of sheeple that want to stay loyal to Boosted / want to look cool -- but the GT looks cool as well and performs better so that was winning them over just a day ago... Its like a new iPhone coming out in a sense, but before hand Android coming out with a badass phone. I have faith in the Raptor and will keep my order

If Evolve will ship they will win back the US market, at least some of it (because again, some people want to stay loyal)

Its a funny video. To me its saying I dont actually like the GT Id rather use my old trick skate.  It would have been better to do the story in reverse.  Start at skate park,  try going home on normal board,  then saying stuff that ill use the GT. They really should have made him do tricks with the GT. Now that would be good. But I know the long board config doesnt really make that easy.

I think he's trying to bridge that gap between e-boards and what we currently know now as skateboarding ... It's a great marketing tactic ... Especially, because of his age...that's Evolves target age range .... The ones with money and working and life isn't thrilling enough type 30-50's years old...
This is a great commercial for other e-board companies....because a mass majority that see this...wont be able to afford it....so the 700-1500 boards will def benefit of this creates a buzz in the market ..... Of course IMO lol

So gizmag has done a review on the new BB 

http://www.gizmag.com/boosted-electric-skateboards-range-boost/43435/

Interesting mention is this however
"While that might be plenty of battery life for a scoot around campus or a quick trip to the store, it did leave Boosted's Boards some way behind its competitors. Other models like the Marbel Board and Yuneec's E-Go Cruiser will travel 10 mi (16 km) and 18 mi (30 km), respectively, while the powerful Evolve Carbon GT we reviewed earlier this month is well out ahead with a monster range of 31 mi (50 km)."

Still  US$1500 plus more for the larger battery, and then it still only has 12miles at best?? And still only 2000w. 
What is boosted thinking?
```

## \#535 Posted by: Michaelinvegas Posted at: 2016-05-20T19:10:58.420Z Reads: 169

The product that boosted wants to bring to the market is a super tidy product that their customers don't need to fiddle with....the non DIY types.... They target the iPhone user per se ..... Plug in to charge ...when you wanna use it... Grab and go....

I think bb and evolves target markets are slightly different...and it shows in looks, functionality, performance and thier commercials...so different, highlighting different uses (BB comes from a fun, practical, small EV, last mile stand point...Evolve comes from a premium Fun, the Porsche of electric boards, you can ride anything stand point) 

Also Boosted is a Kickstarter starlet ... And Evolve was built in a more traditional sense....

Two different boards. Two different companies. Two different target markets. (Of course at a point they overlap)

I would say they biggest competion that these two companies face in the future is not each other or another company per se but actually the DIY community. The easier it is to build at home...will give the consumer a reason to pause before they click that " buy " button

@Dedbny yup, just waiting for the 25th announcement : p

 @loose_nickers its bananas.

@Maxid pretty sure he split it up. Though the app says stopped I think you can pause it entirely and have it not count towards the time. I will check out the app he used

@Hummie we shall see. He was going quite slow, about as fast as a bicycle but if he went a bit faster he'd probably get around 50km advertised. When I get mine I'll put it through thorough realistic testing..think he turned tracking off because his phone would've died with GPS on that long lol

I also think that "tracking off" is just for at the time the screenshot took place - how else is the app supposed to know the max speed?

My worry is that a lot of people are going to be shocked with the price. I've talked to a retailer here in the UK who tells me it will be launching around £1700 which is an insane amount of money. Especially once it gets converted to $$$.

Far out of my price range, but looks amazing for those who can afford it!

I don't think any of the prices will be a straight conversion. I think thats why they haven't released the price -- thats all they've been getting asked for the past month lol

Someone said at one point it would be based off of the taxes and duties or something...so I think everyone will be getting a cost based off of how hard it is to get the board to their distributor I guess. I'm hoping it won't be over 2k for a base model....still no ones sure of how its gonna actually work. We shall see in about 12 hours when the AUS pre order goes live and possibly all others too.

Edit: Oh wow 1700 euros is onlyabout $1900. Thats about in line with what the gizmag review said. Either they are selling everything as a package to justify the price or going to give us various options..but dont think it will just be that price. Im ready to drop 2k though

My quote wasn't in Euros it was in Pounds (£). If you did a direct conversation then after tax it would be about $2400 USD.

yep £ to dollars will kick the shit out all yor wallets.

but wait here is a thought..... spend that same amount on two nice boards that you build and the tools to build them,  so you can ride with a friend, AND can upgrade later AND have 400 left over for a nice vacation or big night out on the town........   .priorities i guess

Well fuck @outsider that does hurt lol.... If it were to be a conversion that would mean $3350 AUD which HIGHLY HIGHLY doubt will be the price if their doing direct conversions. But yeah if its over 2k I'm likely going to build my own in addition to the Raptor..

Think about that though NO ONE other than the richest would spend over 2k for this thing...I'd only be willing to drop 2k if it included street and AT wheels. I dont think your retailer has the final price right because they've claimed they haven't even finalized it yet...unless he got super recent news.

Usually we get screwed in the UK with prices so it may be slightly less in Australia and the US but it won't be a huge margin.

I got the information from Evolve Skateboards UK, so I would say that it's very reliable!!

Damn, well like gizmag said I believe the highest will be 1950 for US...which hopefully includes both AT and street configs. We (well I, since I leave on the East coast US) shall see tonight -- somewhat.. It will be the 25th in AUS and in Asia so if its a direct conversion for evolve asia we'll know

Based on the evolve AU pricing on the bamboo street the direct conversion would be below what the USA sells it for. $989 (price of USA store) vs $823 (conversion)  It cost's quite a bit to get it across to the USA and you pay for that. Most likely the same for GT

**Battery:** 
42V. but this time in the "Spec" they don't mention the Amps...
I guess its gonna be huge...

**Bamboo:** 36V x 7Ah = 252Wh
**Carbon:** 36V x 10Ah = 360Wh
**Carbon GT:** 42V x ??Ah = ANYONE WANNA GUESS? :) 

No going on a plane with this anyway....

I would be interested to know how much the battery costs to replace.

With only a 6 month warranty the good news is that an owner could modify it after it expires.

Or is the battery warranty longer?

Could get real pricey per year running costs to use it as a commuter or car replacement.

this is so fucked up...I THINK they have problems with all their websites.

I received a mail from the newsletter saying its available now.

AFTER its sold out(?)
funny thing is, if I follow that link, even on the US site its not showing the GT.


the question now is:
do I wait untill it shows up on the german website or order it from AUS (with shipping to my german address?)
2891 AUD + TAX :scream:

that would be 3440,00 AUD!!!

WTF?

Australian- I purchased for $2159 for the road and AT combo in AUD. Order #54XX. It was $1959 AUD for the road only. The Raptor is $2090 AUD for comparison. And the Boosted D+ V2 is around $2087 AUD with conversion and referral code. So I feel, at least for Australians, this is an excellent deal given the polish and capabilities of the board (assuming it stacks up on delivery). Maybe less so if you are O/S.

I chose 83mm Evolve wheels, 97mm Flywheels, the additional 38 tooth drive wheels (for 20% more torque but lower top speed) and the 7 inch AT. They will all give a different feel and it will be fun playing around with different combos. If I'm spending that much on a board I may as well have a few different setups. 3 boards in 1! 😊

First eboard fine.  It just wont have the oomph to go big hills.  Old carbon ok up certain hills.  Maybe even try a second hand bamboo or carbon as no doubt they will be on ebay soon.

Also depends on what you want out of it. Great for carving.

it is roughly what it cost if I tried to drop ship from there. they have a table that shows that on their site. but with free shipping I imagine that pushed it a bit as well

Okay I see what you mean. My understanding is that the US and Australian prices are all the same? e.g. Street GT is $1,959 USD and also $1,959 AUD last time I checked - not including taxes and shipping. Probably try what Mr_Mahal suggested.

So it appears they are using ur location to display the price. Even if ur on the Australia website it will auto convert. 
I'm in Germany now. Just arrived. And it's all in Euro even tho I'm on Oz site. 

Anyone got a VPN? Go to Australia VPN and check. 

I think if in Oz the price is still $2000AUD.

Yeah it does auto detect your location. I thought @Maxid was in Australia. You can't pre order from Australia if you are not local or one of the few countries that isn't covered by another international distributor anyway though. So whatever shows on a site that isn't your distrib isn't even relevant

And no point in going to Oz to get one. Cos the watt Hour rating is bonkers big. I hear 666WH. 
To put in context. <100Wh is airplane carry on allowed. 
>160Wh it must go only in a cargo plane. (I'm a commercial pilot myself) I've got an Adeliade flight next month but still no point, airport security might or might not see the battery and refuse it. 
Not to mention airlines have added an extra layer of restriction. Many saying "it doesn't matter the battery size, if it powers an electric moving device FORGET IT"

Thanks a lot Chinese hover boards with ur shite batteries that explode.  Ruin it for the rest of us who buy quality batteries. 

That's the Jazz anyway. 

Now a lot of airport security haven't found out how to tie their shoe laces yet lol so u could try it...

FYI:

VPN US now. 
Here's the price. 
Wasent it $3130AUD 10 mins ago. 

Not in US. 
So I think I can confirm. The price for EVOLVE if in Oz is $1999 AUD or something close. 

There's a stealth tax that evolve is cashing in on. 

Think about it: 
2000$AUD for Oz guy
$2800$AUD for US guy. 
Shipping is not $800. I know there is a shipping fee and a dangerous goods fee. 
Anyway u see where I'm going. But I don't know the ins and outs of fheir balance sheet and fees. 
Just wanted to think out loud

I'm getting lost with what your saying but 2800 AUD is $2013 USD... You just can't compare like this... I bought from the USA distributor that had to pay for shipping from Australia. If you factor in ~$400 you get the price of the street GT. In Australia the prices are the same but if I were to purchase with USD it would be cheaper technically by that same 400 USD, otherwise it would not (right?). Idk, I'm pulling that shipping cost number out of the air, I have to go check again because I believe even that is in AUD.

So you only need the current model then lol or multiple standard packs which comes close enough to the GT price that its practically a rip off...unless you value traveling that much you're willing to pay extra to be able to actually use the board for a good distance

As far as Raptor looks I could care less...it is meant to put in work. Not be pretty lol it has a kicktail which you won't get on the GT -- making it more maneuverable by default... No one will even see your board when you're flying by at 45kmh

It'd go 30.88mph with 90mm wheels and 33.28 with 97mm wheels. This is 100% efficient, however. It'll most likely go 70%~ of that. The 27mph rating of the raptor with 83mm wheels is also at 100% efficiency, so I doubt the Raptor would go as fast as advertised.

If you take a look at the raptor mono video (who's motor has the same kV rating as the dual). he's traveling on a race track which is 440 yards or 400 meters. He made it 1 lap in 39 seconds. Doing the math he's traveling at 23mph.

EDIT: However, if you tweak the numbers and use 11.3 as the number of cells to simulate a 10s setup at full charge (42v). You can get 32.18mph at 100% efficiency and 25.74 at 80% efficiency. The reason I use 80% is because the mono got 23mph in a real world test vs the theoretical limit of 28.48 which equates to 80%.

Jason from Enertion said himself that it's at this speed because it's the best speed in terms of safety, speed, and comfort. It's very dangerous to be going too fast where things can just pop out at you like cars, dogs, people, etc.

Just remembering this quote from @Dedbny
[quote="Dedbny, post:22, topic:2510, full:true"]
Over 30km distance and 40+km/hr. Dont know about you guys, but at those speeds its fast. Im sure it can meet the claimed 45km/hr.
[/quote]

Idk....I'm really itching to push these things to the limit to see what the real top speed is for a 70kg rider...3mph faster (than a BB) to me doesn't seem like a big advantage..but apparently @Dedbny is getting more than that, nearly ~25mph which I would expect to be more accurate. I know the Raptor probably wouldn't hit 28mph consistently but at least 26mph or so would be expected..

I'm just presenting the scientific data. All this is assuming everything is within spec. It could be the 6355 motor runs at higher than 190kV or some other factors. It's just with the assumption that the motor turns 190rpm per volt of power, it can only reach the speeds I've shown unless it was going downhill.

Like I said at 80% efficiency it can reach 25.74 mph at 100% battery. It may be more efficient if you have a tail wind, or are a lighter rider.

I guess so. I know wind changes things but I'm just thinking about the many sunny days where there will be none. I'd hope to be able to hit those speeds. I have very open roads and would only be pushing it on them...really its more about having it available than constantly going that fast. With the BB I had no choice -- the fastest speed available was still "safe" in my experience lol

Here's some good news. My calculations are actually slightly off since the 440 yard distance was assuming he was on the inner most lane of the track. Since Jason said he rode in the middle of the track, it makes the distance he was traveling a bit further. You may get a slight bit more speed than what I said, but keep in mind that numbers are numbers and these are the actual limits of the hardware. Try playing around with the calculator if you're curious.

is the question if with a double motor you come closer to the theoretical top speed because of two motors fighting the friction of the gears
the efficency does not change the rev limit only the chance of hitting it
thats what i think?

Two motors only helps with torque, not top speed. In the video, Jason mentioned it was a full speed start, so torque shouldn't be much of a factor here.

100% efficiency is the theoretical limit of the system without taking into account weight, friction, heat, etc. 70% is just an estimate of how efficient the setup would be running.

Lower kv mate ... Gives it grunt on the lower end and most likely what you need... Unless you ride only open road or parking lot....but if you stay 190kv - 245kv you'll be good ...

That is why I want a Raptor as well. I also like how its a little more compact. I think the Raptor looks bad ass, that picture above does not do it justice, it is all dirty and the CF that is visible is clearly dirty. If i had one, I think i will just use one riser to give it a slightly lower stance.

Don't take it personally man. I think @Dedbny is very passionate about his Raptor, as will I when I get mine. 

If you're a car person, you can think of Raptor like a Bugatti Veyron; its a really ugly car, but the more you look at it and its performance, the more you'll realize its beauty......or not, I got a couple of friends who still dislike that car. So, to each his own I say. I'd like to think of the GT and BB as a Ferrari, aesthetically beautiful from the first look.

Raptors are like a Pagani, and the gt is a Ferrari.

Everybody loves a nice Ferrari, but a real car guy who appreciates the raw performance would much prefer the Pagani.

I mean just look up a Pagini Zonda... It's not your daily driver, but it's bloody fast and laced with CF everywhere. The Ferrari is more normal car like, buy still has good performance... Just nowhere near the Pagani.

Lets wait on the verdict when the GT is out before jumping to conclusion. Like I said, the GT is aesthetically good looking. I almost pull the trigger on it solely based on the look and its claimed specs, but the pricing really turned me off. I don't mind paying for it, but I have a feeling from experience, this first batch will run into problems like most electronic products. Just like the Raptor or the BB, the first batch is usually the testers if I may be so bold. I know it went through some intense beta testing, but real world situations is a bit different especially when it comes to city use. 

I'll probably wait a few months for Evolve to iron out the board before reconsidering buying it. Also, not for nothing, I was really turn off by the 6 months limited warranty from Evolve. If you stand by your product, then give it a full year warranty, but thats my subjective feeling so i'll leave it at that.

I find it amusing following the 'which board is better' discussions. I like the car analogies and I'll offer my own. I've had rotaries, fast fours, turbos sixes, and v8s. People side passionately with one over the other, the reality is they all have different strengths and weaknesses and to be honest, I enjoyed them all depending on what I needed at the time. Torque vs power vs efficiency vs handling vs style. Embrace the diversity, it is what gives us choice and caters to all our wants/ needs. Rather than getting fixated on speed, range, torque, aesthetics, the discussion should be about the design philosophies behind each builder. That goes for DIY too. Those philosophies give insight into the strengths of each board. Jason is openly an industry disruptor and enthusiast with a passion for raw torque/ speed numbers and short/ agile development cycles.  Evolved guys seem like chilled surfers with long development cycles and an eye for aesthetics. The Boosted crew invest energy into smart electronics, 'cool kid' factors, and a prioritization of  air portability over range (their blog shows how they diverge in terms of design priorities/ decisions, as does Jason's Vlogs). Matching your needs/wants/ resources with the appropriate design is the name of the game. Not endless pissing contests and a focus on "Which is fastest today, show me the video". If we didn't have so many different approaches, this shit would be boring as all hell and we wouldn't have any choice. Sorry for the rant, but I feel this forum is smarter than this sudden fixation on GT looks vs Raptor speed vs Boosted V2 range vs DIY cost rubbish. Have the discussion, but keep it balanced and enjoy the differences.  The industry is in a really healthy place, and as with all tech based industries, there will be a constant leap frogging of industry leaders (however you define that) depending on their new design release dates, or what you think is more important for you.

Enertion have claimed more range with higher top speed avg. 40-45km/hr. But my limited testing  is othrwise. If your going more conservatively shouldnt you get more range. Unless you are running around a ring like in his video and at a consistant speed and all hunched down its proobably possible. Ive been riding it on random path, grades and speeds.

Battery life will deteriorate with top speed. Its simple as that. But then go down hill and pick up regenerative braking. Thatbis the trick. You shouls always have a little more juice left even on the limit to get home if you use that braking advantage.

One again unless yourve seen it in real life dont make such a bold statement. Ive seen the GT in real life as well, its a great looking board in comparison. They are all different.

Its all about the GT love here. Cant wait to try the production version.

@magnetvox agree. The theads always get highjacked. Let the reall testing Begin. Im just giving my side with commentaary. We all love or hate for whatever reason its all a mattee of your own taste.

@magnetvox I've said to people many times that there isn't a "best board" because no board can do everything... The GT is king of range right now in the complete market, the Raptor in top speed and torque, the BB in comfort/reliability, and Inboard/Stary for hub motors. They all offer unique things and we should all get the boards that work for our needs/lifestyle.

Personally, I'm a speed demon. But I also love exploring, and going places I would never want to walk (for long). So I got the Raptor and the GT to play with. Now I will never have to compromise! :) 

Unfortunately for my pockets I will likely be getting the 90mm wheels and 97mm wheels to swap between the GT and the carbon...probably closer to fall though because my wallet is literally dying screaming at me to stop!

You cannot compare the prices across different currencies for a distributor that is not **yours**. It does not make sense.........the only way you would be getting it cheaper in Australia than US people were getting it here is if you use **USD** in **Australia** shipping **to** Australia. They will not take pre-orders that are not local. Even though it seems like you can pre-order from them because the prices change for the board it is not so, I believe you can purchase other things and have it shipped to you and that is why they have that converter...

Mr_Mahal, i know what u mean..

i agree too, and it costs Evolve shipping fees to get the boards to their respective distributors in these countries so the cost is past onto the customer...

i was just saying...Oz get the best deal by far, compared to say UK...

I do have one suggestion for saving tho...if travelling to Oz, u can buy one WHEN u arrive there, and pick it up (provided they have stock) then remove the battery and FEDEX that back to your home country, it would cost prob$300 id say cos its small and there will be the IATA dangerous goods fee, but its cheaper then shipping the whole board and battery home. just being the board back on plane urself (without battery) 
or just try your luck and carry the battery in carry on luggage and see how u get on :) many do it and its no issue...

[quote="Kelvinski, post:864, topic:2510, full:true"]
Interesting towards the end of the video where it states 0-25mph (40kph) in 3 seconds compared to what I read previously, where someone said 5-6 seconds? Also, I thought the 83mm used in the video could only reach 22mph (36kph)
[/quote]


I don't know where they got those numbers from...doesn't look like they legit tested it with any tools. I got my 5-6 second estimate from the beta testers I've talked to have actually tested it. As far as top speed Evolve themselves have made a chart for what it should be. The video didn't say anything about which wheels got that speed because they likely themselves don't even know. I will be testing when I get mine and show via phone app and remote speedometer what the top speed is with AT and stock street wheels.

@BrabRS a lot of the beta testers / ambassadors are probably over hyping it. What many people don't realize is that a lot of these testers are coming from a **single** drive (evolve) eboard. So when they call the GT "beastly" or talk about how "dangerous" it is I think it is because they have never ridden something with two motors lol. At worst I expect that it will be a bit punchier than the d+ with the standard gears and a lot more punchier with the 38T gear. Hopefully I'm wrong and it flat out is noticeably better than the d+, but I have rarely, if ever, seen someone compare the torque to the d+ (fairly without bias). After riding the d+ for ~700 miles I have a nice reference point to see how "beastly" the torque is. Seems like there are a lot of new boarders that have been demo-ing these boards as well which explains some of these reviews. 

As far as range though it meets its claims, I don't doubt that the range tests that have been done are legit.

I really want to try out their 38T drive gear with the GT to see how much torque I could get out of it compared to the stock 36T. $80 though will hold me off since I'd rather just get some 97mm abecs to hit that top speed of 26mph..

Does anyone know anything about the trucks on the GT? Axel width? Diameter? Could these be the AT wheels of my dreams?

Evolve already offer 2 pulley options for the gt. Plus they have tonnes of pulley options for different wheels. 
It's odd they would order one. 

As for the belts, from discussions I've had with Evolve, they are specific belts made for Evolve by Gates. GT3 profile specifically.
Stronger than htd
Coming from cars and dealing with gates belts all the time, I'm actually pretty impressed with that. Gates are solid from my experience.

Packaging?!  Isn't that just more trash?  Reminds me of expensive helmet cases.  I recommend taking it out of the box and throwing the board and remote instantly on the ground.  If it breaks you have the nice packaging ready to go.  If they don't break, that's good, and then you don't have to worry about getting it scratched anymore.

You could  be right. I think the GT will have enough speed for what you want and now the extra range.  We will only be talking about meters 😉. So excited for you.  Might have said that before. Just would like to go out with you guys again,  but for longer.  Be good not to have to worry about range or hills. 

Its not that easy as we have tried to take off from start on the Raptor due to all the torque. Its easier on a rolling start,  but even in the vid it seems a tad unsteady to launch off with GT.  Maybe they need to start looking at diagonal aligned motors as apposed to rear mounted to help with traction.

The evolve motors have sensors allowing for perfect control from a standing stop position, something You'll never get from a non sensored motor setup like the raptor has, this is why you need to kick push to start.  As far as traction goes, it's extremely hard to break traction on the GT I have heard as the dual setup just grips even on the AT setup.  I just ordered a GT.....I cannot friggin wait for it to arrive!

If I had never owned an eboard before ordering this I wouldn't mind the wait too much. But going from ownership to selling and then waiting for another is a bit of a rough transition if you use the board for more than recreation. I used the fuck out of my last board for commuting and as long as it was dry, it was always near me or under my feet.

I have a car and all but driving here is a p.i.t.a. and parking is even worse. Add in the fact that summer is near (which means more traffic, longer days) and it only compounds... I've gotten used to not having one and now that I have my pre-order in and the Raptor will likely ship soon I am a lot more calm..

Good deal for those of you that want to hit 26mph with the GT but hate neon green: 

http://www.roswellsskateboards.com/97x52mm-spoked-longboard-wheels/

They are selling abec clones basically but you can get them in red, black, or blue unbranded. About ~$14 cheaper than the abecs. Got a pair now in anticipation of them selling out when people realize 22mph isn't enough to satisfy the inner speed demon forever.

@Rob.Endless The GT in AT mode should be able to eat it all up easily. Potholes may vary. I've heard you can even get the old 8" wheels on there.

** **Edit 2** ** The black wheels have sold out it appears :/

Kevlar vs Carbon fiber
What it comes down to are what we engineers call "Material Properties" specifically ultimate strength, stiffness, and facture toughness.

Carbon fibre has a high ultimate strength (the force required to break it) and a very high stiffness (the amount it stretches/bends when force is applied to it). Fiberglass, Kevlar, and carbon fiber have all got approximatley the same strength and are stronger than aluminum or steel. Carbon fiber is far stiffer than aluminum, steel, fiberglass, and Kevlar. This makes carbon fiber ideal for making a strong, light, stiff structure and is why we use it.

The downside of carbon fibre is that it is brittle (has low fracture toughness). You can easily cut thin sheets or cloth with scissors. Carbon fibre cracks easilly particularly in cases where the force is quickly applied (during impact loading such as a crash, it can shatter). Furthermore, once it cracks a bit, the crack can easily grow longer and a cracked structure (wings, fuselage) is not a good thing.

Kevlar on the other hand, has a particularly high fracture toughness. It is much harder to crack, very difficult to cut cleanly even with very sharp scissors, and stands up well to impact loads. That's why it is used for bullet-proof vests.

So, when choosing a composite material to use as a reinforcement, you look at what type of loads the area being reinforced will like see. Kevlar is a great choice as a reinforcement in the upper wingskin over the main retrct in a Bandit for example. If you land hard enough to break the flex plates, the Kevlar has a better chance of stopping the aluminum frame of the retract unit from cutting through the upper wingskin. Caron fibre, with its high strength and stiffness is a good choice for a wing spar since you want a strong and stiff wing. You can also use it in the fuselage or structure to add strength or stiffness but it would not be a good choice in corners of cutouts since it can crack.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/dad961a18745c85ee735913c47f71ed14a4443c2.jpeg" width="690" height="459">

I guess I'm just impressed they sold out so quickly considering we had to pay full price up front and it was for quite a bit more than the competition...I'm sure Boosted has a lot of pre-orders in because they only required a $100 deposit and did the referral program.

Wouldn't it add to the weight making it worse than the previous carbon if they wanted it to have the same range? Not to mention it would probably make it a lot fatter (aesthetically) as well. They say it should last ~1000 cycles which is really low. Considering you won't (or at least I wouldn't) need to charge this more than once a day I don't see why it's that bad. It would theoretically last ~2+ years

i saw this video a while ago it explains why  lithium batteries die and why you will never reach the advertised amount of cycles.
in short the battery will only reach the 1000 cycles in the tested lab conditions and you will only get half out of it.

@bbq870 @HH1 

So even if the battery the GT uses lasts 300 full battery cycles wouldn't that equate to thousands of miles considering the range you're supposed to get out of it on a full charge? 30(miles on a charge) * 300 (full charges) = ~9000 miles? Don't think most people including myself would rack that many miles that quickly

Lol I would agree...prob 30miles the first day you get it but using the 30miles range every day? That would be a long commute... 5-10 here and there....sometimes it's fully charged when you grab it...sometimes it isn't ....

You can have healthy useable miles from the battery for a long time.

I wouldn't use that much everyday, maybe about 22-25. So it should last a long time. What's the safe % you should charge a battery to? Would it matter if I'm going to use it everyday?

I watched it about a year ago

I forget most of it and can't do it again.

There are different chemistries though and they have very different life cycle ability
Lifepo4 the longest 
Li-ion pretty good
Lipo not so good



Think evolve is still using lipo. Cheap. Not as safe ( a lot of evolve have caught fire and I wonder what percentage of them compared to the infamous hover boards)

It would be good to know what the bms is shutting off the charge and the discharge at as it would tell you a lot about how long the batteries will last.  Especially with such a big pack you won't need to squeeze every ah out and you could stay in the nice comfort zone of 3.6 to 3.10 or even a narrower spectrum. Maybe you could alter it. Last like 3x as long as 3.3 to 4.2 which is commonly done

@mr_mahal if I remerber it right the guy in the video said that the batteries would last a lot longer if you do not drain them under 10% and do not charge them over 80% but I have heard somewhere in this forum that you want to charge your batteries once in a while to full charge because all the balancing of the bms happens at the end of the charge cycle so that your batteries stay in balance charge them once in a while to 100%
if you use your board daily you are likely to get more charge cycles out of this battery since these batterys do age

I'm sure there an evolve guide and recommend levels as to when to charge it....

For example...let's say it's fully charged....and let say ur nephew or niece tried it out...really quick....used it for like ten minutes.....I wouldn't stick it back on the charger.

Also, even after a hard ride on the board and it needs to be charged...wait a little for the battery to recover and cool down...I give it 15-30 mins before I put on for charge...volt levels will level out from the voltage sag.

Hover board was using li-ion I think but there's different chemistries of that and also some brands had manufacturing problems and worse quality control likely and that could've been the result.  I never found out why the hover boards were going up
The evolve had a couple go up that people posted on es.  People who wrote about it and knew said the board's design was possibly to blame as it should've had thinner wires I think and that would've acted as a fuse , but then maybe more resistance in normal operation.  I don't know. I think evolve was really good about getting boards to people who burnt up.

 All helpful tips mate to help extend the life of your battery...

Gotta find that balance between what you should do and what you wanna do...

You're biggest enemy is over discharging...you can't over charge...bms is suppose to do that...the balancing ... That happens the moment you plug it in...as you get closer to full charge the amps going in the battery slow to trickle ...then stops

I imagine the bms monitors the max discharge and the charge max.  If it balances at full charge, which most do I think, then it would maybe be good to full charge but regardless every cell would be monitored so if u never fully charge I don't think it would decrease your cycles really

Following the logic with how wheel mm affects the top speed it would be 46kmh or 28.5mph with the 107mm....insane. The torque still looks solid with the 97...may have to go 107mm then for those insane runs.

Considering the torque I saw from that clip, probably marginal from the stock wheels. I'd say stick with stock for torque and go with 107s if they work. I ordered some 97mm...I just might return them but I want someone else to confirm the 107mm will work first. I don't think I really need them as 26mph is fine and the difference in torque between 97 and 107 will be a little more pronounced.

VOver on endless sphere you can't find info about the fires. I don't know where.  You'll have to search.  I wouldnt make it up.  There were at least two boards. There was a scandal I remember where one guy pulled down his post and retracted some statement or something and was rewarded or so it seemed. There was a discussion about why they had caught on fire and somethings about some wires being too big and if they'd been shorter they would've fused

Difference between lipo and li-ion I don't know.  Battery university  say it's the Same most don't.  There are different chemistries and at least some of the li-ion are much harder to catch fire. And they generally have greater energy density and lower discharge ability an last like 3 times as long.

In my experience, any rechargeable lithium battery can vent to atmosphere if the conditions are right, and the possibility of fire with any high voltage/ current electronics device application is a no brainer. How high that possibility is- well we probably need statistics and studies, not forum posts as references (not saying it didn’t happen- statistically speaking I believe it probably has).

Back to strengths and weaknesses- if you select a cheaper battery with a shorter shelf or cycle life, economically is it better or worse? Depends on cost/ range analysis. If you fit a larger battery system in a smaller form factor, and it goes further than an alternative on each charge, but has less cycles available- again it may or may not be better. Eg, You can go 12 km 2000 times, or you can go 30 km 800 times, at the same cost, then its arguably the same outcome. How you actually use the board though, and your charging habits, with alter the perception of economy one way or the other. 

In my experience (not with skateboards but with military radio systems) the environment makes a massive difference in any battery performance. Some chemistries are more resistant than others, but they are all affected. Very cold weather absolutely kills performance. Extremely hot weather and direct sunlight drastically increases the chances of venting and/or fire.  I think the different perceptions people have will be heavily guided by the location you are in. I never see snow, and so my experience with battery life and range will be vastly different to someone who does, when comparing the exact same chemistry. 

People who are new to e-boards scour these forums long after they have been written. Posting assumptions dressed up as facts about batteries in general undermines the process of learning from each other. Also, arguing on one consideration alone about why one battery solution is better than the other is a bit asinine. Argue based on a complete assessment of life vs cost vs form factor vs cycles vs charging costs vs environmental performance preferences vs portability (air vs land only), versus safety record, and if possible clarify facts vs assumptions. Otherwise this is a bit of a wasted discussion because we go around in circles.

Actually, I want to talk more :slight_smile:

It's seems no different internally from the raptor. Same logic, also a 10s lion battery. Still can't find the number of p, by the size, it looks like 3p or 4p, which would make it the same config as the space cell. I don't see how that battery pack gives 31 miles... I would like more info about their setup, but have yet to see anymore details about the battery (Ah, Wh, ...), so I still don't believe that number is even remotely accurate. Its about as thin as you can get a board with lion batteries, so bravo to them for that, but I don't like bs numbers that suck people into to buy, only to find the range is very different later. If they would give more details (like enertion does), it would be easy to tell if that is the case here or not.

If you look at their spec sheet of wheels, they give the different top speeds for each size of wheel. But, when you go to buy, they say up to 26 mph. There's no disclosure that the size of the wheel matters. It's shady IMO to put information the way they do. They say there's a few factors that MAY impact distance and top speed numbers. But as a consumer, if I didn't know better, I would believe that i might at worst get 27 miles of range and 24 mph top speed. The top speed for the 83mm wheels are not even that high, so people are going to order and not realize they aren't really getting what they want because of the way the information is presented in a misleading way IMO.

- my two cents

There's already real world tests done by people that showed the GT getting >60km so I wouldn't say it's not remotely accurate. I'm guessing it's a 10s6p lipo battery.

Don't see much deception in saying "up to 26 mph" especially given they have you choose your wheel size before adding to cart, and offer the speed table in the first place.

looking at the buying page, I don't see the speed chart. So the info is not with the rest of the specs, and needs digging to find.

Also, video of range test, with real time power consumption data overlayed? If not, I don't believe it. Like I've said before, with the space cell, I could get 25+ miles if I'm on flat and going down hills. Real world, I get 5 miles, mostly because I have long stretches of steep up hills. I don't see anything indicating what range you could expect in different riding environments (like a data sheet).

Is that standard? I don't think Boosted, Inboard, Acton, etc have data sheets on expected range for uphill/downhill. As a consumer, I'd just assume the testing was done on flat ground. FWIW, the >60km range was achieved in eco mode on flat ground.

agreed. My point is they aren't giving enough details to put the distance I can expect in perspective. Just because no one else is, does not mean the next guy shouldn't either... That's just bad logic IMO (its like saying I won't go to the gym because no one else I know is). I think that giving a sheet or graphical representation, showing the different factors and the affect they have would have on range and top speed make the board more transparent. When you make claims of having something unique, back them up with irrefutable data. And that, they have not done IMO.

I will admit that the US site does not have the speed chart like the AUS site does. There's a lot of hiccups between different distrib sites. But this disclaimer does exist on all of the distrib sites if they are carrying the GT and copy pasted the specs.

It's not much worse than Boosted honestly. Boosted has been claiming the D+ goes 22mph when in fact it only hits that speed for a millisecond in pro and then maintains speed at 20mph. Boosted has also claimed their board gets 6 or 7 miles when in fact users rarely see that range unless they are on all flats or in eco. 

[quote="evoheyax, post:1028, topic:2510"]

The range will always depend on your environment and especially your riding style. Companies probably don't bother doing extensive testing to come up with charts because it is practically impossible to capture all the factors enough to form a real-life range expectancy. There could be more disclosure of this fact, but then people wouldn't even have a rough number to really go off of when they consider how much range they have. The truth is that it is a relative number and no one can precisely predict your range except you. 

[quote="evoheyax, post:1028, topic:2510"]
But as a consumer, if I didn't know better, I would believe that i might at worst get 27 miles of range and 24 mph top speed.
[/quote]
Again, as a consumer, if you were really concerned about this you would wait either find someone with the board and ask them to test or wait for it to be reviewed. The people who get excited at the specs and jump at it should already know the risk in getting something they have not seen tested. This is not Evolve's first long range board, which is one of the reasons why I don't believe they are BS'ing about this one, and I don't think the tests out there are fake -- despite your doubts. 

[quote="evoheyax, post:1028, topic:2510"]

On the US website and possibly others I believe this is the case because their speed chart is missing. But technically for everyone else it is their own fault for not looking closely at the specifications. I'm not surprised they would market the board like this the same way Boosted does marketing 22mph -- except Boosted doesn't really go 22mph (for long).

[quote="evoheyax, post:1033, topic:2510"]

This would have to be a pretty robust data sheet that has to take in a shit ton of variables: wind, height, weight, temperature, hill grade, acceleration/breaking habits, speed change habits, etc. Too much to track. This could be done by a third party. But it would still just be a bunch of numbers thrown around since conditions in the real world change to such an extent that they can skew testing results imo.

The absolute funniest part of your statement is that you state Evolve offers no facts to back up their claims, yet this thread is littered with posts of the information they have made public, proven from their testing.

They offer flat ground ideal testing, because this is the only way to come near a consistent repeatable number. If your area has two hills, and my area has one, then i will get better results than you on any board. Very simple. This is not Evolve being sketchy, its Evolve showing exactly how they achieved this number, and how you could too.

Hills, weight, setup, riding style, how many pink mojitos you drink, are all variables that affect this number. To cater for every possibility is ludicrously difficult and to be honest - not enough return on the time invested to do.

The GT customers will prove the numbers. You can either be part of it, or be left to turn back early when your battery is flat.

If you want the numbers for your style of riding, test it yourself.

So far Evolve is the only one who has come to the table and been very public about its performance. They also offer it in a $2k product that works straight out of the box. No assembly required.

For the longest time Boosted had only marketed their boards based off of the Eco mode. The reason why this is bad is because they sell the same exact board in 3 different versions. They constantly claim the board gets 6 to 7 miles when referencing its range when that is only really true for their boards in eco mode or on flats. The d+ sees none of that range (in pro mode, the only reason you would get a d+) and gets at the very most 5.5. Realistically for me it got about 4.5. I live in a hilly area so I only use pro mode, I figured I would get less range but it frustrated me for a long time that they wouldn't just say what the real pro mode battery life was like. With BBv2 they finally disclosed it, so B+ for them.

It's not that you have to cater to every possibility, but there's two really main factors that will affect top speed and range, and those are rider weight and hills. Wind can't be tested for, it's unpredictable and changes dirrections too frequently in the real world, and in most places, is not an issue. My point is they don't even post a margin of error, because they don't bother testing to know. Eliminating these large variables would reduce the margin of error in their numbers, and give more transparency.

There's too much conversation in here to see every bit of information in this thread. This threads purpose was speculation and discussion, not to be informative about the board. And while yes, their are bits of information found here not on evolves website, It's near impossible to find it all due to the number of posts.

I have yet to see any video showing range testing. You can engineer a range test to be really good (i.e ride down hills and flat only, never up hills, calculate the exact most efficient speed and ride at that, ect.), that has been my whole point all along. And I've yet to see a good any company produce good information that can be used for comparing the pre-made boards out there.

They have many different configurations of gears and wheels. They show one going up a steep hill (barely) and another doing acceleration, and another speed. And All three videos I saw of those where a different configuration. It's hard to get torque and top speed. gearing and wheel size will affect both of these numbers. So it's possible to make this a torque machine, it's possible to go a fair speed, nothing doing both in the same config, and even then, that's one config. Not all configs will climb steep hills, not all configs will get the same speed. Picking different configs that highlight good torque and decent top speeds are separately is cool, but misleading IMO.

This is a science and math heavy field, yet, I see little science or math being presented...

Range on esk8s is like milage and consumption stats on cars.  You never get the advertised consumption because this is the optimum that can be achieved under controlled and ideal internal and external factors.

Anyway, real life examples will soon be there and i believe they will be close to what has been advertised. There is no point arguing for or against at this stage. What is though undisputed is that the gt is by far the best spec'ed from all the rest of the mainstream brands.

Dude, it's as simple as this -- if you don't like the board and it does not perform as expected you can return it within 7 days while paying some fees of course, but still getting most of your money back. If they fudged their numbers soooo much to the point where they were being very deceptive of what the real range was under ideal conditions they would see a lot of returns. Which I'm sure they don't want for the longevity of the boards. Except, there are beta testers out there that are doing tests themselves for others to see (specifically on FB), AND letting people who can make their way to them test the board out themselves to see if it meets their claims. I understand you won't rest until you see a video with gamin-like data displayed for 1-2+ hours straight though, so I guess you will have to wait while everyone else is busy riding.

I never claimed to know the "full science and math". It doesn't take a genius to realize the factors that go into predicting range when you've ridden and experienced first hand what weather conditions can do to affect an eboards performance. I road my BB through the winter and spring for 700 miles in total. So I know realistically how varied my range and overall performance can be affected by my environment. I am saying that there are so many things that go into it that it is a lot of work that I don't think would make a big difference in sales for these companies that are selling to the average esk8 consumer that just wants to get a board and ride. Maybe if they were marketing to the DIY community they would, but obviously they aren't (unlike Enertion).

You cancelled your own arguement.

The whole vibe of car reviews is how their performance tests compared to the companys advertised figures. Exaclty the same as what you are seeing with eboards.

Let the GT speak for itself. Very few have already tested and there is a bucketload to come.
It certainly seems someone cant stand the fact the big boys might actually be able to do it better.

Have you gone back up through the thread mate?
There's pictures from the Facebook page from one of the testers and his specs. 
@Mr_Mahal even spoke to the guy and got his track map. 
On the Facebook post they openly say the test was about efficiency to see just how far the board could go. Also in the pictures he's rugged up, and as it has been stated, batteries reduce performance in cold conditions. 
If you are still saying you haven't been given information regarding range I'm not sure what you are chasing??

Best to check the Raptor third batch thread, I would quote Jason's latest reply but it is quite big. Basically, batteries are in the US but have not gotten to the distributor yet. The carrier has gone MIA but someone told him that it should get to the distrib by Sunday somehow..Raptor's need VESCs, the 100 batch he got had an LED light on the wrong way or something. He said the VESCs worked but that one light didn't, so it should be getting back to him a week from now -- obviously pushing delivery dates down the line. 

So it's looking like I will get the Raptor and the GT at the same time lol

It's not a matter of better, just different outcomes. The 32T has more top speed, it's the only where you can speeds 36kmh and above. The 38T has more 20-30% more torque but the highest speed it can reach is 35kmh with the 97mm wheels. Evolve has a speed chart that explains it

It was a fault by their assembling crew in US, but that's the past and should not happen again I guess:

I agree with you there.  I'm just complaining because I everytime I think I'm going to get the raptor it just gets delayed even more for whatever reason, I do realize it's beyond your control though.  

Here is what I'm expecting to happen so my faith stays strong with Enertion:
1) Email about the raptor VIP club as you posted in your vlog today/tomorrow

2) you stated your US distributor will get the batteries on the 8th, it's now the 9th.  So i'm assuming they will ship those this week

3) My board was supposed to ship this week but it got delayed by a week due to some LED issues on the VESC, so I'm expecting my board to ship next week

If all this happens, I will be a happy camper!!

I suppose if i was paying a team of Chinese workers just a few bucks and hour to assemble my raptors i would be a bit quicker too.... at the moment my dollars are going into paying Aussie workers at much higher wages.

Also, if people want a fast ESK8 they can just build one.... 



----------


----------


Jeff said it himself in his live feed.... the last two years have been a hell of a ride for him... lots of ups & downs... 

The difference is I am broadcasting my ups & downs & developments publicly as they happen, anyone who is interested can see how tough it has been... he has kept his hidden so he wouldn't negatively affect his brand & sales figures.

I think it's a smart move by Jeff to start doing more live feeds & the video updates! In fact, i predicted that he would do it one of my [ vlogs](https://youtu.be/tLRKwIJbMD8?t=12m28s) 

I assume his increased public exposure is mostly a reaction to the frequent videos updates he sees me publishing that educate the masses about how to make really good electric skateboards at home.... he wants people to see that he is just as authentic.

- As of today my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFugBVZgaQ5fCp-kLmyWq1A) surpassed 1 million views
- Evolves YT channel has not yet reached 300K
- This forum has 1.9million Views in a very short time

**The more people I educate about building awesome ESK8 the less customers he has. He is not a fool, he would know that!**

_....... So i suppose it depends what score board you are looking at... Because I'm clearly winning that race...._

You sir, are a visionary. Predicting a company would explore options in modern day's biggest marketing tool is a truly a mind-blowing revelation.. It's definitely not a statement from a graduate of the obvious. Congratulations on enlightenment.

...... So i suppose it depends what score board you are looking at... Because I'm clearly winning that race....
[/quote]

So let me clarify, just to make sure I understand.. 
You have 1million views, and sold around 100[?] raptors _(I'm guessing, I have no idea, but a forum skim says this number should be generous enough.)_
Evolve have 300k views, and sold out of 1000 GTs in one day, and another 1000 a few days later..
Conversion rates say you sold 1 raptor for every 10,000 views, and Evolve sold a GT for every 150 views, not counting however many non-GT boards they have already sold.
Common maths says on that information Evolve needed 15,000 views to outsell your entire production run, which is around 5% of the views they have already done.
Are you winning the race, or haven't realised you're the one still left running? I'm curious what happens when Evolve gets 1,000,000 views...

But I'll give you credit, those maths are a little assumptive. I'm sure not every one of your 1,000,000 views are pursuing information on the raptor. Your insightful views on customer service have probably garnered good chunk of attention, all of which I assume has been super positive.

I'm intentionally going to ignore the 'educate about building' comments purely on the hypocrisy of selling an (almost) complete yourself.
So lastly, [quote="onloop, post:23, topic:4458"]
This forum has 1.9million Views in a very short time
[/quote]

The most awkward point you have raised, as your convincingly most engaged thread is about the very company you claim to be beating. This thread alone has probably drawn a significant percentage of your recent views, meaning that the interest in your competitor is quite significant, especially from users in 'your own backyard'.

You seem to have a lot of defences, and/or excuses to justify your current inability to match your competitors success. Which as I previously predicted, is much more than I think you were expecting. Right now the attitude reminds me of that kid in primary school who would never win in sport, but always had an excuse to why he lost - ignoring the fact he might not yet be good enough.
 
**You shouldn't have to explain your success, your results should speak for you.**

Sorry if Evolve offered a product and attitude that appeals to me more, I was unaware defending a product I am satisfied with is unacceptable to you.
Though I suspect your opinion may not be the same if it was your product I was defending. Curious thought.  
Good luck!

Conversion rates say you sold 1 raptor for every 10,000 views, and Evolve sold a GT for every 150 views, not counting however many non-GT boards they have already sold.

I assume his increased public exposure is mostly **a reaction to the frequent videos updates he sees me publishing that educate the masses about how to make really good electric skateboards at home**.... he wants people to see that he is just as authentic.


As of today my YouTube Channel surpassed 1 million views
Evolves YT channel has not yet reached 300K
This forum has 1.9million Views in a very short time


**The more people I educate about building awesome ESK8 the less customers he has**. He is not a fool, he would know that!
[/quote]
Maybe I'm wrong but I think @onloop's point was that he is reaching quite a lot of people that would otherwise be Jeff's customer. That doesn't necessarily imply all of those people end up being *his* customer instead though (because he does show in his videos that there are other alternatives to his products like hobbyking).

Guys, there is no point comparing Evolve to Enertion. Give Jason some time to build his business up and organize it and I'm sure he will have his share of success too.

One thing that I have commented on @onloop 's vlogs and I really appreciated in Jeff's live feed was his response to questions regarding competitors (ie. boosted) "no comment". The guy focuses on his product, his company and his customers and doesn't bother to get in the comparison game.

In addition I believe this thread should be merged with the original Evolve GT thread

The battery problem was solved from someone who owned a raptor and who had a second battery here in Germany. But to be fair I have to say that Jason send him a new battery. So that's all good but I think it's a problem to send a broke product to someone overseas when you can't provide repair service there. I think you have to test those products even more and that was obviously not done. Second problem with the vesc came up last Tuesday. Today I got the mail from customer service that I have to wait for "a few weeks" for a new vesc. I can understand that it's not easy to run a small business and deal with a couple of  hundred percent growth. I can really understand all that. But for me as a customer I can't say that it was a good investment right now.

@Dustin89 Fully understand where your coming from.  Please be patient. Enertion are doing their best.  Its obviously not great to be delivered a faulty item which could have been checked prior to shipping.  At this point the batteries other than US are being shipped to you direct from the factory.  Thats the factories fault that they sent you a bad one.  The things are already expensive so he is trying to cut additional cost to buyer.  Ie not having to send it from China,  Aus,  then to Germany. 

Hopefully the new Vescs are good and your back pumping hills again.  Just remember how much fun that is and be patient till it comes.

This is for e  bike  But is Worth it to read

There are a lot of factors that affect the range of the electric bike, such as:

What power assist setting you are using?  Most power assist bikes have 4 assist levels.  Some e-bikes just have a throttle that you can vary the assist with.  This is pretty common sense, but the more assist you use the less range you will have.

Are you climbing a lot of hills?  Range goes down.

Are you riding into a lot of headwinds? Range goes down.

Are you carrying heavy cargo on your bike? Range does down.

Some bikes may have a very inefficient motor (lost energy in the motor due to friction, etc.) that causes decreased range, but these days most electric bike motors are fairly efficient (there is room for improvement!)

What is the condition of your bike?  A well adjusted bike goes farther i.e. well lubricated chain, proper tire pressure, etc.

What is your tire pressure?  Lower pressures = less range.   There is a nice balance between too high a pressure (not comfortable) and too low a pressure (not efficient).  50-60 psi is a good pressure range for street riding.

Are you pedaling at the right times?  Pedaling at critical moments (when accelerating or climbing), you will go farther.

Pedal more => More range and better health 🙂

If you are concerned with range I recommend going with a large capacity battery pack.  Some electric bike manufacturers have use a standard 10 ah pack with an option to upgrade to say a 15 ah pack.

I can understand all this. I am not really mad and everyone who wants to have the high end power and fastest board has to go with enertion. There is nothing what can compare. But for me it's pointless to have a board which I can't use. I have to admit that it's a great product when it works. Maybe it's getting better with the newer batches, I don't know. And I'm still a fan of enertion and would consider buying the next generation. But right now my reality is, that I have a raptor which was only fully usable for a couple of hours and that seems to be disappointing.

I asked if you were first batch mainly because you guys were essentially beta testers. Jason could not have known how many issues would pop up without releasing it to customers. He probably could've done better QA like some other companies are. I don't know his process...all I know is whenever your first batch of something you will most likely have issues. 

I haven't seen Enertion's older VESCs, but even Jason himself called them Chinese crap. He is trying to up the game with these new ones made in the US. Hopefully they are up to par similar to chakas and you should have no issues if you get these new ones as a replacement. They are changing everyday and we are a part of that growth. It's unfortunate QA is sacrificed in this process but I think he will change that as his workload is reduced by his new employees and he can focus on making sure we get the best boards he can build.

Haven't gotten toooooooo in depth with the plans but I have ideas as to what I want to do. I've been focusing on getting the things I know I need to have to up my current production value (I've been making youtube videos for a while). One of the big purchases being a nice fluid tripod head and a slider for some more cinematic shots when I'm doing voice overs instead of just my face : p. Some interesting go pro mounts for shots while riding, and a more portable mic I can take with me while on the go and possibly record while riding. Really pumped to test it all out.

As for tests off the top of my head:

* An accurate hill climbing test **with no cuts**, making sure to show the board(s) fully charged, the hill gradient, and a split screen to show that I am applying full throttle. Also stats on my weight, show current winds, temperature, and my clothing. 

* Top speed test with the 83mm, 97mm (knock off flywheels), and stock AT wheels. On flats, going up long hills, etc. 

* Braking test, same idea with all wheels above, maybe use some chalk and bring a ruler to measure distance. Also test on different inclines as well. 

* RANGE TEST, this will probably be the hardest to do and take multiple videos. still thinking about how best to do this. The first one will be in GT mode on the street set up with the 83mm, likely on a flat terrain in the city, going around a pre-designated area a bunch during a time of day where cars are less likely to be around. Won't be all that realistic but for those that do bike paths it might be. Following that will be a number of tests in different scenarios such as: commuting to work in the city, commuting in a hilly suburby area, cruising on bike paths, etc. I will pretty much entirely leave out AT for these tests because almost no one has really given a good go at street testing besides one guy that only did it in ECO mode. Still thinking of more ideas but this will be a lot...

* Sososoo many more things to make videos about, but I will try to condense them a bit depending on the subject matter, the above deserve videos standalone and are what I see most people concerned about so I will try to make good videos on them. It will be a very busy summer for me :D 

Currently just learning how to use my tools better and also collect as much information ahead of time as I can.

I'm good :p I'm actually gonna try not to wear it this summer, not only because of the heat but also if I fall I'll need to replace it due to the foam likely being compromised. Will probably wear it just for some promo shots on the Raptor/GT, and then all of mid fall into winter. I'm gonna get this as a daily full face for the summer instead, it's [$67](https://amzn.com/B008Z9HNJO) , dual certified with great reviews by a brand who I already own one helmet from that worked well.

I'm sure you probably could...if you were to right now it would probably be pretty complicated and I wouldn't expect to see your money so soon. At least not in time for you to try to get another LHB before end of summer lol. Worst case scenario you can sell it to an existing owner that wants another. I remember something similar happened before with first batch owners, one guy wanted to get a refund and basically Jason was trying to just sell it straight away to someone else that wanted it instead of shipping it back and all that. Point being: you'll get your money back if you want it but it may be more effort than it's worth.

The GT is on schedule, I'm in no real rush honestly for the Raptor because it's gonna take time to test each and make videos. Would make it easier if one is delayed lol

In my opinion Enertion have ttwo types of customers the DIY guy that they don't care about burning vesc and waiting for parts to arrives and having issues with their board because that's part of the game they are DIY and  they love repair and fix and what not... that the hubby of it!!!  and you have the regular customers that they are not DIY ,they just want a board to commute between work and home, they want to ride the board right off the bat and not thinking about anything  else then having fun!! This type of customer will buy boards from evolve ,bb, stary !! And here's the problem when they see the raptor from Enertion they still thinking it is out of the box board ! But the dont realize they are just getting into the DIY world !! Believe it or not they just find out that  later on!! And that's what's deceiving for them!  I remember one day Jason said in one of his video there are 2 routes the DIY and the complete out of the box boards !! In my opinion Enertion  should stick with one of them not both because the majority the are not DIY  guys!!

Ok, I finally got an answer for my previous question:

Are the Kegel drive wheels currently listed on Evolve's website universal for all Evolve street boards? I have the Carbon GT on pre-order and want to purchase a pair of Kegel drive wheels and a set of Orangatang wheels. Is this compatible with the new Carbon GT: https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/collections/wheels/products/kegel-drive-wheel


Hi Rob,
While the Orangatangs are an option for the GT series, I an unable to confirm if the kegel drive gears that we have in stock at this time will work with the GT boards. By the time the GT's arrive I should have an accurate answer to your question. I have flagged your GT pre order so we will contact you for any possible add-ons before we ship your board.

Thanks again for your order!

Adam

Hey guys, I'm new here but thought you guys might have some questions?
My board just arrived today and I took it out for a spin once before it got dark, this thing is a beast!

A few little notes so far:
The battery indicator is great however it varies a LOT, one moment I'm going up a hill and it's on 4% and then the next I'm speeding along a flat and its showing 46%.
The breaks are very responsive (almost too much, I fell off once already just from breaking too hard)
The carbon fibre makes it look amazing but it scuffs up very easily, already got a decent amount on the bottom unfortunatley (from breaking too hard and scraping it, but that's my bad riding)
If you guys have any questions, or want any tests done let me know

@LordofTaco Can you open up enclosure and see whether you can post some pics or find details of whr or something on it regarding amps power output etc. Thats what the DIY giys want to know.

Yep! I have the street setup with evolve 83mm wheels. I'm around 65kg. I was riding a on a lot of varied surfaces and speeds and hill grades (up to 30%). Over about an hour I went 20.4km total distance mainly in fast mode and the battery started at 83% and ended at 38% (but the percentage varied so much it's hard to tell how accurate that was) Over the next few days I'll do some tests (and use it real world conditions) and keep you guys posted on range and battery.

That is a highly impressive range given that you were doing 30% hIlls.

Anyone have any explanation for why the evolves smaller battery pack is able to get so much range?  I have a 12s4p 430 watt hr and I'm getting 15 miles (24 km) from 100% to 1% on mostly flat smooth tarmac.  Average moving speed of 16-17 mph, good summer weather, weight of 60 kg.

I was very very impressed with the range, I'm keen to do a full range test of normal 'fun' riding, and then trying to get the best range possible to see what it is. However when going up steep hills near the end, the percentage would drop way down to 3 or 4%, and then back to near 40% when on flats. (apparently it's a voltmeter so when the battery is under load the voltage drops) Not sure how that'll relate to real battery life however.

I'm faily confident I'll be able to get the 50km advertised (in good conditions) and probably around 40km in everyday conditions (which is rather hilly for me) 
I've never owned a board before, and I have only ridden a boosted dual+ shortly so unfortunatley I dont have much to compare this to.

Jeff said, the GT is more efficient than the older versions and the motors are lighter. But 50km would be really impressive, I think this is marketing, real life range should be 40km I guess.

I need a 500Wh Battery to get 50km on my Gen2 Evolve.

@Photorph I knew I made the right decision and Evolve wasn't bullshitting :) If you refund your raptor, you may be able to hop in for second round for GT sometime soon once they ship out first batches orders before the end of the month. You'll probably get it by August.

@loose_nickers I am definitely "keen" for this :p 

@E-Boarding, man 40km with 30% hills....insane. 50km is realistic I'd say if you live on flats. Take into account he's also light as well. I'm about 71kg, so hopefully should be seeing that amazing range :D    

Some of you may still be doubting this board without any videographic evidence, but I'll be glad to show you all when I get mine :smile:

I got my GT today!!!

Heaps of torque!! Went for 20km skate from %100.(GT mode) Mostly flat but surfed a fair bit of grass ans grass hills.
Battery read %54 when I got home seems consistent on AT setup.

I believe it'll do 50km on streets. ( an evolve tester got 63km on eco mode )
     "       "        35km on AT.

I previously had carbon and it went faster than advertised and also got range as advertised..


P.S. Careful from start on GT mode lol....

If you can see how your GPS and the remote speedometer match up that would be great. Also if you could see how long you can maintain 42kmh on the 97mm wheels or what speed you can cruise on going full throttle in GT mode that'd be all I need. A few people still doubt the accuracy of the speed claims by evolve. Range was the other but that's already been proven :)

Don't need to pop the hatch @darkydawson , @Dedbny  it is 360Wh with li-ion batteries Jeff has confirmed this already in a live broadcast on FB.

Anyone else finding the Evolve drive gear with the ABEC wheels are really hard to get on and off? The drive gear on the old Bamboo with ABECs were really loose.

@Rob.Endless christ man, I really hope you never fall that CF helmet is overkill if you're new...you will have to bail at some point especially with the GT lol everyone has at least one fall. I suggest getting a back up full face that's cheaper for starting out. The foam can get compromised on any helmet when you crash and you have to replace it. Would suck to be out of $400+. As far as bearings save yourself some money and just use Zealous. Especially if you plan on switching wheels often. Built in spacers and speed rings will save you a lot of time. 

Now what is this "bra" you speak of :hushed:

Pleas be careful dude! I know it's hard to do but try to start slow for the first few rides. When I had the Yuneec E-go I crashed a few times, hard. And that's at a snail top speed of 12.5 mph. Even at that speed I teared my muscles real bad, I'm actually still dealing with it a year after several incidents, can't even work out as hard as I used to. That said, falling off the board is like a ritual that most eboardee will go through, so safety first! 

@mr_mahal I think I'm going to buy the GT in a few months (you guys have really convinced me) when they work out all the problems from the first batch. I think I'll do some DIY on the Raptor and use it for adrenaline rush whenever I can.

lol, you remind me of a guy we took paintballing once, he had a well paying job and has never played. We planned the outting 2 months in advance and he BOUGHT $3,000+ worth of gear. On game day he was dressed like Scuba Steve and so padded up he had no idea he was shot. He didn't like the game and never played again, sold all his stuff a few years later

I would suggest you borrow a plan ol' skateboard from someone or just buy cheap $30 one from Walmart and get the basics of rolling, kicking off, turning and stepping off.

Congrats on the enthusiasm!

Pro tip: to conserve battery (which you'll never need to do) you could even throw w.e backup longboard you have in this backpack and just k&p when you're in a crowded area. Or whenever you're in a shop just throw the GT in there. Definitely gonna get this eventually, makes traveling with the board much easier.

Well if price is your constraint and those work I guess that's cool...but I haven't even heard of those brands you mentioned (except evolve of course) when it comes to bushings. Maybe it's because I'm in the U.S., but have a go at some Venom eliminators, black widow bushings, or venom barrels...those are the best in the game here. Haven't tried the double kingpin truck so not sure how these bushings will need to be configured but I'll be making a video on bushings and adjustment in the future.

I'm actually gonna go with this:
3M Clear Bra Paint Protection Bulk Film Roll 6-by-25-inches https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B3IXSMA/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_2vvyxbTXA5BBP


...sorry for the sudden change lol I don't really want cover up the bottom of the board's glory and c.f. tape may not be as cohesive with the existing c.f. in terms of the color...I feel like it would look a bit weird the more I imagine it. I still have some left over from the last time I did it to my BB

That looks like a fair amount of 3M clear-bra film, I just purchased a larger portion just in case. I also bought some standard color CF vinyl and a silver version for fun. I am going to try and clear bra the whole top deck as well as the bottom portion. A nose guard is not a bad idea as well, not sure where i can buy one that fits tho. Now, i wish they made some type of cover/skin for the remote and maybe slap a screen protector on the display lol.

Yeah I'm getting two lol but clear bra the entire top??? I assume you're talking about the shiny parts lol I might try that.. Not gonna mess with the vinyl though. I will probably put a screen protector on the remote too, I feel like one bad drop and it's done lol

They make a nose guard for the previous carbon, not sure how it goes on though I'll have to check

Lol I bet if you call them you could pick it up. People did that with Evolve HQ. For those awaiting it to be shipped note there are only 3 employees at the USA distrib so they might not get that many boards out the door day 1. I suggested they go by order # in terms of shipping, they were uncertain, and said they might do it that way...so I might get mine shipped fairly early :p

@Rob.Endless 38T gear only avail on .au site so far.  Stock is 32T.
@Jinra Yes, on ABEC they were clarifying that the default gear coming with Evolve street wheel set was in fact the ABEC gearing as I was assuming.
This all came up in discussion w/Evolve USA + AU about how to get the ABEC 107mm to work, where there is a modest workaround as the axle is not long enough for centerset with 64mm contact patch and 75.5mm width

@Mr_Mahal  Spoke with Evolve AU on board cover and a few other items I was trying to get them to sell to me while not available via US distributor near term.  The old bamboo & carbon covers are not exact fit w/GT, but old carbon close enough though.  New GT design custom fit will be coming (Au at least) in a month or so, but for $20 seemed worth a try.

It's 260mm, so the GT should be 52T as well. You only only fit a specific fit amount of certain pitched teeth on a length of belt. And yea, maybe about the cover, though if it truly is a problem, you can go with 12mm belts and use the cover.

The good news is... I GOT MY BOARD!!
The next good news is I managed to do a bit of a range test tonight.
Cold night (winter), usual coastal winds, and a bit of stop starting, and still broke 50km!! 
Tracked it with Garmin Edge as well and it was pretty accurate. 
Hands are freaking freezing and feet are numb. Heading for a hot shower/spa, I'm out.

Also keep in mind that he said he was freezing, so technically he could've probably road a bit faster if it was warm out since the battery was probably not performing at an optimal level. That's really exciting because it means he probably could've gotten closer to that 60km mark or been going 25-26kmh and got the same range.

As @Mr_Mahal just said, it was pretty cold. 
Figured would keep speed down to combat the cold. 
Also had some coastal winds riding. 
I'm still impressed, as it makes me confident I'll be able to ride further in better temperature. 
I reckon same distance at 25kph is doable. 
Pretty happy with how she rides. The drop down deck is really nice. Where my feet sit is like they lock up against the drop down.

What's your full set up? Do you have the 2 in 1, extra drive wheel, or 97mm wheels? Looking to see what it's like to ride on the 97mm with the 38T

Hey guys just reporting

Day 3 back on AT setup. Ripping up[ the grass. Maxing out AT 35kmh. (might play with belt tensions & pressure tomorrow)

Can get street to 40kmh.

Drop down deck is awesome, Turning circle is sick!. Fly up medium hills at bout 30kmh lol. Torque city!!

Controller display is pretty accurate against gps (+/-1kmh) Evolve have definitely outdone themselves with this board.

@mr_mahal damn, my 97mm flywheel clones are useless, they are just like yours, spokes are way too thick. I might order some spare abec 11 gear drives and modify those instead. Also going to order some legit abec11 97 mm flywheels just in case, i want to see if i can hit that top speed mark.

So stock abec gear drive is 32t and the other one is 38t. Just to make sure, 32t stock gives better top speed vs 38t, meaning the 38t is meant for the 107mm flywheel so that it can have good torque still since its a bigger wheel?

I don't think the 38T is meant for the 107mm flywheel as it seems the issue with the 107's is that they're too wide for the current pulley. 38T is meant for 83-97 fly wheels for more torque and lower top speed.

@Rob.Endless I think I just bought the last legit 97mm fly wheels in the US from Nord Boards. Reason I think they are the last is because they are also sold on Amazon and they said they had only 1 pair left before I bought. There is another shop that sells them in the Netherlands, just a bit more expensive, I'd order now so they get in before the board. Sounds like a good plan learning how to mod those.   

Also the 38T drive wheel is so you can get around 30% more torque, it's how Jeff got up that 31% grade hill and that video. The speed chart on the AUS site shows what the difference in top speed it makes

I think you could just dremel/drill a wider round opening for the bolt to fit in.

Or even a fine round file could do the job.

Just make sure to keep the opening centered.

I was going buy to some on ebay but noticed most abec 11 flywheels have the wheel size and hardness printed on them. I saw a set of abec 11 97mm on ebay but its missing this info on the wheel. Possibly fakes? I messaged the seller, and waiting for a reply still. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Abec-11-Flywheels-97mm-78a-/262429231323?hash=item3d1a0048db:g:AYoAAOSw60lXMPwl

I guess i could file the clones, also ordering extra 32t abec drive gears and i'll mod those so it can fit clones, i like how the clones come in a variety of colors. Plus im an idiot and already have 3 sets of 97mm clones lol, black, purple and blue.......

Ok, so the rain clear and I just had my first hit out. I'll do a quick review of my thoughts. For context- I've not ridden any other electric skateboard so I don't have any benchmarks. But I'm also not someone who trumpets something just to avoid buyers remorse or to enter a pissing contest on who's board is better. For the cool kids (DIYers)- I haven't built my own board yet, so I'm a filthy complete owner for now, don't fear, a build project is starting to form and will be underway soon. 

So, the GT. First thing that struck me was the engineering. This is a well put together piece of kit. First ride was 1-2 hours, nothing came loose, everything worked as advertised, no random noises etc. It just did what it was suppose to do straight up. 

I have undulating hills around me, mixed in with smooth flat areas, and the odd step hill. You need to be in fast or GT mode to eat hills. The board easily rode every hill that you would want to ride a board up and down for fun. According to the controller, I did 21 km on my first ride, and had 71% charge when I got back. The regenerative braking contributed to that I suspect, given every-time I went up, I could find a good long coast back down. Plus I wasn't breaking any land-speed records on my first run. 

The next thing that hit me were the brakes. Rock solid. Like your first car, you get fixated first on speed, then on acceleration, and then you realise brakes are probably more important for going fast. Because they get you out of trouble and give you confidence to push things. 

The remote is excellent. I found the trigger mechanism is sensitive but I dialled into it after about 5-10 mins. The benefit to the sensitivity is the fidelity on the control. You can accelerate and brake as finely as you like, as long as you don't get carried away in the moment. I wore snap-on mechanics gloves- they are designed to give you dexterity in your fingers and they worked really well with the fine trigger control. The control sits comfortably in your hand, and it was handy being able to check speed, distance and battery in front of you by bringing up your hand momentarily.  

I spent about 2 mins in slow, 10 mins in eco, the rest in fast. Once it completely is dry outside, and I feel I'm qualified to not kill myself, I'll give the GT mode a go. I found I rode mostly between 20-30 km/h after maybe the first 10-20mins of WTF am I doing. I've never ridden one before and it was that straightforward to get up and moving. 

Carving. You can tell this thing was built with carving in mind. It was very stable at straight line speed but if you get into carving that is where it really shines. Buttery smooth is how I would describe it, and I've only been carving since morning tea so that is saying something. I thought I'd be more of a point-to-point kind of person but the carving was the most enjoyable aspect of the ride. 

The board layout works. My feet felt locked in on the W concave and the slight drop down. I got better at tight turns as I went. I suspect a regular rider would turn this thing on a dime. I'm use to kicktails and had to adjust to leaning heavily into tight turns at low speed, like when I wanted to turn around on a hill. You do have to pick it up in tight situations, and the board is heavy, and big, no doubt. There is nothing really to pick it up with, which makes it a subtle challenge to lift, but the smooth, flat carbon belly makes it easy to carry like you would a normal board, once you have it in hand. 

21kms down, and I didn't come off once; that has more to do with the fact this thing is just well designed and very balanced. I watched the videos on this forum on how to ride the Raptor and that shit works. Lean forward, accelerate, lean back, brake. The fine grain control meant I didn't get launched, but I had to think about it or it will launch you. Loads of torque but it is dialled in to be accessible. 

The ride was very comfortable. The stock road wheels are excellent, but again I have no reference point. They just feel smooth, forgiving, and just grippy enough. I hit a cats eye going uphill at about 20km/h early on and the board didn't flinch. Less speed might be an issue, but I didn't get caught on any debris or cracks.   

No controller dropouts or anything. Which I realised is important if you want to enjoy hooking in a bit harder. 

People stop and stare. One bloke lost his mind when I was crossing near a pedestrian crossing. They are a good looking board up close. Others just cant work out what you are doing, especially if you are moving like a boss.  

Cars are pretty dangerous. For whatever reason they seem less comfortable passing that if you are on a bike. Doesn't help that the quest for smooth road tends to pull you out from the edge maybe a bit more than normal. I just found I couldn't predict what drivers would do as well as I can on a bike, maybe you are harder to see or they don't expect you to move so fast on a board, or both. Didn't have any real issues but I was cautious near cars after seeing some random moves. You cover ground fast so need to think ahead about other road users. Momentum governs your braking distance more than the brakes, as you can brake harder than your posture can support. 

There was still patchy water on the road- no issues. I realised early I I needed to look ahead a bit further than on a normal board because potholes and puddles come up quick. I didn't push my luck, if I went through some surface water on the road, I kept it slow until the wheels dried (5-10 secs) and then got back into it. 

Fun factor- excellent. I use to jump out of planes for a living and it's been a while since I've had that really fun kick. No different to skiing or snow boarding in that sense, but strange because you can do it on the streets behind your house. I really enjoyed it. 

The board came in AT mode. Changing over to road took about 10 mins (first time so some of that was double checking) but it was simple enough. I haven't tried the AT wheels/ mode yet. 

In summary- impressed. Even at the price I felt no remorse (which I was expecting). I rode probably as long as my novice legs would carry me in a first hit out, and I had enough charge to do it 3 times over. This board is a legit transport replacement in good weather if you wanted it to be. It's not last mile, its the whole journey. Pretty good bit of engineering, they did their homework and executed it well. 

Will see how it holds up with more testing etc.

Edit- spelling and grammar

@magnetvox Great post.  Be good if you said all that in a review YouTube vid.  Ditto about cars.  Drivers have no idea.  They dont know what to do, so keep a safe, if on roads.  Glad its all to your satisfaction.  When your paying over 2k its not a toy and the build quality needs to be high.  Good on Evolve.  Just going to be alot of happy owners.   I think with the range,  carving and wheel options Evolve are on a winner.  They cant pump them out fast enough.  As for the riding period.  The more you get use to it the more you will want to stay on it. Youll be doing 1/2 hr rides. Then when dark youll want lights so you can n go at night. Eboarding is addictive.

@magnetvox I think you can find more evolve owners on their facebook page. And hook up for a group ride that way by contacting ppl in your area with a bit of luck. Try my where are the Raptors thread Ive started a list of owners there to message.  I did a group ride with 6 guys last time. Most Evolve owners and we had a beta GT on the ride. Good fun.  We had 9 boards. 2 of them on the ride have upgraded fo the GTs.

## \#1348 Posted by: magnetvox Posted at: 2016-06-17T21:45:33.283Z Reads: 158

Yeah, good question- depends on interpretation. It has excellent brakes and will bring you to a complete stop on inclines but once you are stationary it is only momentary. It won't hold the board there. So if you are going up hill and you brake to a complete halt, I found it would then lightly start roll back unless I applied a small amount of throttle to hold it in place. Does that make sense?

How do other boards do it? 

I imagine it is so the board doesn't draw current once you are stopped? Or perhaps a limitation of the esc logic? Or because it separates braking from reverse?

I definitely noticed it though because intuitively (without having ridden an e-board before) I assumed the board would hold in place if I kept the brake on while stationary on an incline, but it didn't. 

I'll confirm today for sure, but that is what I recall.

Well, the Boosted board uses "Fred Flintstone" style breaks which means it basically throws itself into reverse to get you to a complete stop. Technically the BB doesn't come to a complete stop in a sense without you applying throttle in the appropriate direction which is what @magnetvox describes he has to do to keep the board in place.

So if you wanted to come to a complete stop AND hold it in place going **downhill** then you'd want to apply the breaks in acceleration mode, and once coming to a stop put in reverse and lightly apply the throttle....I guess really the point is going by what @magnetvox you DO come to a complete stop which the entire purpose of the breaks, to hold it there you can just step off or do as I described but I don't understand why that's necessary unless you just want to look cool lol

The breaks do keep you rolling very slowly on hills, you come to a complete stop and then you'll roll very slowly, but it's not an issue as you can just step off the board at this point? Unless you wanna look 'cool' like Mr_ mahal said, but I feel like you'd look 'cooler' if you have the control to slow down, and then just step off casually when you've come to a stop as if nothing happened.
The board does roll relatively well when you're not using it as an electric board so maybe this has something to do with it? A normal long board will roll down a hill, and so does this one.

That brings up another question, @LordofTaco how is the rolling resistance on the board? Can you kick push on flats well somewhat? I would guess how you set up the belt tension matters quite a bit, but Jeff made it look like it was better than the tension Boosted auto sets on theirs -- meaning it shouldn't be cumbersome if you had to for a mile on flats

I can't relate this to any other electric boards, there's definitely some resistance however I was surprised at how well it rolls, I wouldn't mind using this as a normal long board at all.

You can also push while holding on the breaks but I imagine that isn't good for anything, and it's difficult. Not that you'd want to anyway

Good cut on the brake issue. Agree with @Mr_Mahal and @LordofTaco.  Just rode into uni. 9km on the dot, flat/ gentle downhill. 98% charge left. Arrived quicker than it takes on the bus.

Just want to agree with someone before, I find I don't use GT mode all that much. Currently it accelerates too fast for me. Fast mode and GT mode are basically the same, GT just accelerates faster and can definitely climb hills better. On steep hills I'll switch it into GT however 90% of the time I won't be wanting that acceleration so I just stay in Fast mode. Obviously this will be different for everyone as I'm not very experienced yet.

Had my first proper ride today with a total distance 16km to the shops and back. Most of the ride was on footpaths with lots or rocks and cracks which didn't seem to be too much of a problem for the board (Evolve 83mm street wheels). Cruising up hills around 35kph (with throttle to spare) is a lot of fun too. The breaks are very good and can be feathered when you just want to keep a safe speed down a hill. The trigger is pretty sensitive and you'll want to be very careful with not getting trigger happy around traffic as the board will launch from under you very easily.

A few issues I had were getting around in tight spaces such as where the footpath meets the road. The lack of kicktail means there is a good chance you'll have to get off the board frequently to change its direction for tight turns. I'm planning to add some freebord s2 bindings on the front and back to resolve this issue.

Another strange thing that occurred is after the first 8km when I got to the shops the battery still indicated it was 100%. Which is obviously not possible especially considering the number of hills I had to climb. I noticed less power climbing hills towards the end of my trip back (which is expected) however when I got home the battery indicator stated 90% left. I would assume there would have been closer to 40% left based on the power I could feel and distance I traveled. The voltage of the battery had dropped from 42.1v to somewhere in the 38v range. Will be contacting Evolve to see how the remote is calibrated to the battery.

Overall awesome board!!!

My boosted board was the same way too with the caliber II trucks, I ended up having to get a whole new truck altogether that was for skateboards but could pump and carve pretty amazing. I've never tried the double jointed trucks on the Evolve so I don't know how I'll be able to get the turning radius perfect but hopefully it's possible.

Interesting..the indicator is a volt meter pretty much so it will jump and fall depending on how you're riding as you know. I'm wondering if when you got to the shops how long did you wait again before checking it? It might have updated after letting it settle for minute.. If it didn't that could be a bit concerning.. Definitely let us know what they say, would like to test this as well.

The turning circle is actually pretty good if they are loose. But I would prefer tighter trucks (for high speed stability) and a kicktail for quick changes of direction. I'm hoping the freebord s2 bindings will give me the agility I'm used to on a snowboard.

Kick tail would be nice. For certain commutes I would prefer a more nimble board like the Raptor which I'll have as well soon enough. It's possible to live without the tail though at least in my experience. I just got very good a riding with loose trucks. I imagine the stiff deck will be amazing for that riding style since I should have no problem sinking and and making sure I'm stable. Will have to play with different set ups when I get mine and probably make a video.

I believe it can be done by using 2 x slightly longer inner bolts on each truck. I'll also use some sort of material between the bottom of the binding and the truck/board to prevent scratching. The bindings should arrive mid next week so I'll probably post a pic then.

Just finished a third hit out. Decided to hit GT mode and ride to the top of the foothills near my house, where the wealthy people hang out overlooking the city. It's the type of climb which has you working real hard on a bike, so I rarely do the climb. 

I carved up there at about 27 km/h. Crazy. GT mode is your friend if you live in a hilly area. 

At the top of the hills, the roads became paved. The pavers generate plenty of vibrations in the wheels. I decided to stop and check out the torque on all of my hex screws, given I've done close to 50km since I got it. 

I found that one of my motor holding screws was half way out of the mount. I had changed over from AT to road before my first ride, and at the time all the screws (from factory) where binded nicely with loctite. The video guide on AT to road advised that enough of the residue would remain to simply re-torque the hex screws when resetting to road. My advice for those who purchased the 2-1, grab some medium strength loctite now, and re-apply every time you change set-up and break the motor screw bindings. If that screw had of come loose completely (matter of time) it might have chewed my belt or gear. 

After re-torquing the screws, I carved all the way back down. The brakes can be applied so progressively that you can find your exact speed you are capable of downhill and just carve the whole way, regenerating as you go. 

I got to the bottom of a 2km run (2 up, 2 back down) and I was at 97%. Like @zoo, I'm seeing numbers on every ride that I don't think are possible, especially early on. I suspect the discharge rate on the batteries are logarithmic, not linear, and you really have to expect great perceived mileage early, with a progressive reduction as you go. Probably no surprises there for the experienced riders. 

My ride into the city yesterday was great. My city is much smaller than most (Australia vs US) and dominated by bike and bus lanes, so I didn't miss a kick tail. But if you had to work tight situations and pavements, you'll have a hard time. A lighter shorter board with kick tail would be better if you navigated public transport as part of your commute. But if you have a long distance to cover on bike paths, this set up is rock solid. 

I've also had to tighten my front truck slightly from the factory setting. It was slightly too loose for balancing while kick pushing away from lights etc. Those with better balance/ muscle memory will be fine, but just check it out before the first ride.  

I didn't think this thing would compete with my bike in terms of mobility. I've changed my mind. If you live in a hilly area, you'll much prefer this commute.

And I love the sensitive remote. It rocks in terms of fine control. My advice is be very careful every time you first get on after a break. Unless your muscle memory is established, you'll screw up your launch by over committing the throttle. Again, probably no-shit-Sherlock for those who are experienced. Each morning so far I've gotten that wrong and gave myself a hard launch.

Can screws just be retighten without reapplying loctite? Evolve's videos make it seem so. I always thought loctite hardens completely and then it is set, and that once the screw is loosen or even further torqued down after it is set, it ruins the bond. I used loctite for some of my r/c cars and once I readjused the screw, even ever so slightly, the bond is ruined and the loctite pretty much has no effect.
```

Yeah, thats the point I was making @Rob.Endless, the Evolve video says you can; based on the experience I had today (and also my wider use of loctite), I'd say no. So I agree, loctite everytime that the screw or bolt torque is adjusted, otherwise the screws will come loose and ruin your day.  These things take a hiding on rough surfaces.

As for the battery % remaining:

It seems it drops slower in the first 50% than the second. 
And definitely it will drop lower while under load I found. From chatting to the evolve guys, it is in fact very much a real time representation. 
I.e, heavy load on Hill will show lower figure. 

When you get one, definitely take it for a range test nd watch how the % moves as you ride. You'll get an understanding quickly of what it's showing.

 I have changed from AT's out of the box to street. Then back to AT's now back to street. I haven't had to apply loctite yet and screws hold while skating so far. Will have to apply at some point but holding for a few changes as jeff said it should.

I always carry a toolkit while skating which includes loctite, bearing lube and puncture kit. Good to be prepared.

Been windy for 2 days in NSW no skating for me ATM :frowning:

I believe all distributors are getting the boards directly from the factory and need to perform the tests that we saw on the live feed.
The german website says the boards will reach the port on july 1st. Then 5 days to pass through customs and get to the distributor. Then I guess a few more for testing

@Rob.Endless they replied back to you today or last week? They are supposed to have them today or tomorrow. And yeah like @constantinos156 said, they get it straight from factory, they can do the testing themselves plus you never know what could happen mid-shipment. The orders we saw via live feed in AUS were for AUS customers only. 

I emailed them earlier while my friend was getting replies from them and changing up his order, they didn't answer either of our questions about the shipment being there, but last week they were saying it'd be this week. Hinting that maybe they are going to reveal today that they have them and are withholding so that we don't spread the news before they can lol

@mr_mahal yeah, you can see it in the pic, at the very right side of the pic, that black spot is not a reflection =( i'm not really trippin tho

@constantinos156 i am a noob at skateboarding period and just bought a regular longboard to practice less thank a week ago and slapped on some 97mm wheels and make it over lips like that all day long, especially sideways.

Update: took it out for a spin on my ten min break, slow mode is useless, eco mode is ehhhh too slow, i'm on fast mode now. GT mode just throws me off the board, both on acceleration and braking, the trigger control is sensitive as hell. I just suck at this eboarding riding in general at the moment. Also, the sidewinder trucks or whatever its called feels pretty stable to me so far.

Welp, I'm officially jealous of GT owners right now. At this point, the Raptor feels like a myth and legend to me. You hear story touting its speed and torque, but you never get to see it in person. :neutral_face:

Hey guys, just went for a morning ride and tracked it.
I was in Fast mode for most of the ride, switched to GT for a few steep hills but then back down to fast again.
Totalled 26.69km with an average speed of 17.6kmph because I got lost and had to wait at lights a lot, my average speed on the board was around 30kmph

Here is the tracking info and also the battery was still over 50% by the end of this ride!

Should be about $210 in total. Was $110 for abecs standalone and I heard the upgrade to AT was $100 from @Jinra -- all shipping with my board, asked yesterday as they were shipping for the abecs. I believe they are quite limited with those so I'd ask soon (since everyone will want top speed and the Abecs are **literally** sold out everywhere except for some places where it'll cost you near $150+).

3. Grab lunch on way back to work
4. Plugin my board in Bosses office (cube would probably blow a fuse)

Okay guys, just got back from about an hour and a half ride. I finally got GT mode on and had it at full throttle for long periods of time. The only time I get semi wheel wobbles is when I look down at my feet to reposition them while going fast. Almost flew off the board a few times from braking too hard on accident. I didn't have my TSG pass helmet on me, i just had a regular skate helmet and shades on. I noticed my eyes started to hurt from all the wind lol. Got back, looked in the mirror and i looked like i was high haha. I wonder if its because of my shades and how it seems to direct air straight into my eyes.

@mr_mahal Pleassssse, put on the clear bra asap. Im not riding mine again till I get mine on. Just shoes alone scuff up the CF's finish(messed it up on my hour and a half ride) pretty sad about it....imagine how the clear coat of car starts to peel, well...it sorta looks like that.

@Rob.Endless, I've done 100 km in the last few days and still not a mark on the board.... Are you sure your 'scuffs' don't just wipe off. Carbon fibre is a bit more resilient than you are making out, especially in skate shoes. Just needs a wipe, just like paint.

Hey folks, we are all curious how much you really like the board? Can you carve nicely? Is the remote trigger too sensitive? Comparisons to the Boosted... etc. I'm ready to drop out of preorder on the M1 and pick up on the next GT. Keep the reviews coming ! Thanks

Love the board, shorter, lighter and more acceleration. Drop down deck is great, feet lock in nicely.

Carves better than carbon with shorter deck. Double carve trucks The lower profile is sexy as hell!

Trigger is sensitive and controls nicely. Heaps of Torque, eats up grass, dirt and big hills with ease. ( ** Careful on GT mode... LEAN FORWARD on takeoff. LEAN BACK if you break ).
Display really seals the deal. Easy to read and speed and distance are quite accurate.

Not a huge fan of the bearings but waiting for my oust moc 9's and also like to upgrade the 6900z drive bearings. ( have tried nachi double rubber seals in the past but am going to give NSK a go this time. ) Hopefully get a couple of kmh more out of it.

Only problem has been with my AT set but evolve service is really good. I have dealt with them in the past with no problems.

If you like Esk8ting get one of these, for a complete board this is way ahead of the competition. A balance of speed, acceleration, torque and range. The controller with display and being able to quickly change from skate to offroad really tops it off nicely. ( let me know if I left anything out lol )

Verdict: Hurry up and get one. So worth the money!
P.S. I've never tried a boosted but seems over priced for what u get ( or don't get )

Just upgraded my order from street to 2 in 1 plus an extra charger for the office.
What is interesting is that they made the upgrade and I'm still in the 1st batch which lets me think that  all gt s might be comming as 2 in 1 's frok the factory and depending on the orders adjusted to steet/AT only by the distributor.
Also my understanding is that they will be sending me the old standard charger as the spare since they specifically told me it is compatible with the gt and i don t see any new chargers on the german website

They probably had extra of those swappable kits so adding that to your order turns you into a "2 in 1"
The charger is the same because the battery is the same wH even though it's now lithium ion instead of Lithium Polymer.

How much did that set you back? I remember seeing these a while ago and wondering if they were any good at all. At first glance, it looks like a decent offering for a no name Chinese board. I'm thinking you could upgrade to Hummie's or Jacob's hubs on that thing too, if you find it lacks power.

$763 delivered to my door NYC. And yes, I have JBloy 83mm dual hubs, Chaka vests, and steez remote all spare if need be to upgrade a component. I will crack the deck open and put it through paces this weekend, but honestly looks ok and first swap out might actually be installing the vescs to tune it properly and eliminate a speed cap as hub motors did not heat up much when I took a first spin at 35 kph

10:45pm here in Cali and I just got in the house after riding the GT, it is non-stop fun, mannnnnn after dinner(really late dinner because of the GT, my whole family finished their dinner hours ago haha), I'll probably go for a ride just around my street. Also, 2nd day of riding and I am in GT mode 100% of the time, I think my electric unicycling experience helped me out a bit.

Okay, so I'm not sure if its just my AT wheels or what, but these things have a little wobble to them once i hit 20mph, its not enough to throw me off my board, but it is there. I played with foot placement and putting my front foot closer to trucks helps a lot. The tip of my front foot is right behind the GT symbol on the front trucks. BUT here is the thing, i threw on my 97mm flywheel clones and all speed wobbles completely disappeared despite crappy foot placement.

I tightened the crap of the trucks just to see it went away, same thing. When I get the chance, i will try to catch it on video, which will be easy since it does it like 90% of the time. I ordered really hard bushings and i hope those help out. 

Also, I just bought a GoPro but too lazy to start recording stuff haha. Well....more like the editing and uploading part. 

someone asked about carving, it carves really nice but i tend to just go fast and straight 99% of the time.

@magnetvox i wish i was wrong, it is a spot where the clear coat is wearing out, it is a tiny area where i put a lot of weight from my lead foot, i was wearing DC shoes, nothing hard or crazy.

@darkydawson, i would say its like 99% or so true, its not like my 97mm wheels that are pretty much 100% true. I just put the flywheels on, not sure when i'll put the ATs back on.

@magnetvox yeah i know...it does suck, tomorrow i have a day off and i will be putting 3M clear-bra film on the top portion of the deck, i'll post a close up picture of the damage. @mr_mahal because you already have the 3m film, put it on before you even test the board for a long period of time to avoid this.

Also, it is like 1am and i just finished riding the GT around the neighborhood, i love the torque the GT mode provides, such a blast.

I think the fact you can go so far with the gt in one bout means that you can get more experience and spend less time charging lol Rob said he's been on an electric unicycle (I assume the one wheel) so I think he's used to the sensation. Wouldn't have taken me long to rip it on pro if I had more range initially, and it was warm... I was learning in mid winter, very uncomfortable to be outside lol

I feel that acceleration would be better on the standard 32T gear. 38T is better for continuous torque output, but 32T leads to a more direct translation from motor rotation to wheel rotation. Since the GT has huge torque from its motors anyway, you'd get off the starting line faster on the 32T. However, this is all just conjecture.

@photorph thanks, i almost ate it today but thank god i was already slowing down for a turn. I was able to run it off.

@mr_mahal ebay, this one exactly, these are the purple 97mm flywheel clones i got that have the actual abec 11 core dimensions, unlike the black clones we got that have extra thick spokes.  I am about to buy another set since i know they work and they're only $20 http://www.ebay.com/itm/151887087264?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT

@ermac-514 i have some extra hard bushings on the way, i'll let you guys know how they work. They are bushings someone recommended on this thread. knowing this thread, it was probably a hundred or so posts ago.

BIG PROBLEM, so i just got back from an hour ride, all on GT mode and was cruising at max speed or near it the whole time. Out of nowhere, there was almost no throttle response, i looked down at the controller and it defaulted back to slow mode and got a flashing "batt error" message in red. Here is the picture: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/24713650a1634f2890579ff937e258663ee5d675.JPG" width="669" height="499">

Controller is fully charged, if I have the board on, I cant switch modes on the controller, it is defaulted to slow mode along with the flashing batt error message. If I turn the board off, the controller is back to normal, no batt error message and I am able to cycle through the the different speed modes.

I sent evolve an email about the issue about 10 mins ago.

...I was specifically avoiding the DIY route as my first eboard so that I can avoid down time as much as possible. Third day riding the GT and It already has a problem. Also, the motors were only on the warm side, not even close to being hot hot. The deck itself get a little warm, barely warm, plus it is sunny as hell here right now in southern California.

Update: Turned it back on, I was able to switch back to all the modes. Pulled the trigger in GT mode and about 2 secs later, it defaulted back to slow mode and "batt error" message flashes.

@Rob.Endless Fuck...probably the first big manufacturing issue so far... Surprised I've never heard of it before but will be interesting to see what the cause is. Best case scenario they just send you a new battery no questions asked and it'll get there in a day. Although I'm really wondering how many spares they have laying around. I would take video of the issue and unlist it on youtube to show them.

P.S. I bought the black wheels again in anticipation that they would fit -____- you have tested the black ones recently and they did not?

Doubtful, seeing as how the regular abecs have the same spokes. Just don't remove too much plastic. Although, if the plastic was a different/weaker composition than normal spokes, it may be compromised.

Hey guys @Rob.Endless @Photorph @Jinra @caustin

Talked with a rep from Evolve USA and explained everything Rob said and this was basically the convo that followed:

Rep: "All the new remotes have a diagnostic indicator like a car. If something is wrong it will let you know, like a check engine light. I personally ride in GT all the time and have never had that issue. I hate to say it but it looks like we have our first faulty GT. If it was a low battery it would say "battery drain". "Battery Issue" is completely different. I could be wrong but it sounds like the remote is doing exactly what it was designed to."

Me: "I see, so what would be the process of resolving this if it were to happen to one of us? Do we send the whole board or battery? Could we do an exchange where we ship you our battery and you send us another in the mean time?"

Rep: "If that is the case then we would most likely do a battery swap.👌🏻all under warranty "

I would still like to know what caused this...at first I thought it might be because Rob uses GT mode a lot, but seems like it might just be a faulty battery. So far no one else has had a faulty production GT (or beta, at least shared publicly) so thats the good news... We will see over the weekend as I bet a good portion of people in the US will be pushing it hard.

Ok, pickup up GT at lunch per my project plan. Box was broke open on the motor side but everything looks in good condition. Could use some more padding, just came in the Evolve black box. (Street only edition)

Charged the controller and board up and did a few circuits around my work parking lot on econo. Trucks seems very very loose compared to my Eglides. 

Question:  how do I tighten the double trucks. Tighten both nuts on each truck the same?  Does one have more of an impact than the other?

Going took take it out for a hour or so ride in a little bit. Really quite and smooth on Econo mode.

Thanka for looking into it. I called them about an hour ago and got a return label. What sucks is I'm off work today but drove to back to work because I left the box here(at work now printing the label).**strong text**I also have to swap back the AT set up and my AT set up is at home. Once I pick it up at home, I have to drive back to parents house becase that is where my board is at....

@mr_mahal forgot the mention, the noseguards needs to have holes drilled (easy anyways) because it doesn't line up. Also, the black clones purchase is a risk, the link above for the purple ones fit for sure.

@Jinra have you ridden a d+ or any other popular commercial board? Grrrrr me and my friend must be the only (past) boosted owners that are getting this board lol Acceleration on the d+ isn't much, but its still fairly quick for what it is. If the GT can double/triple that, I will call it a beast. Can't wait to get my board Monday. I need to pump some vids out : p  

@Rob.Endless No problem, great to see they gave you a return label and are taking care of it. Makes me want to ride the hell out of my board as well so as to weed out problems like that. Luckily I have full pads :grin: Going per your experience I will be wearing my full face if I have my abecs on :sunglasses: I ride pretty recklessly and if this happened to me at speed I'd be in trouble without pads. 

Also, can you take a picture of where you drilled the wholes in the nose guard? Do you think they are even necessary of you just put bra over the nose? Or are you noticing CF chip after taking small impacts? I would think it's tough enough to take some brute force. J

I've ridden a benchwheel a little bit and my friends boosted dual (not plus). I can confidently say you won't be disappointed by the acceleration and torque. Ive found that is easier to keep your footing in GT mode rather than fast since fast has too much of a dead zone and will jolt because you instinctively push more throttle since nothing's happening. GT has a fairly linear acceleration ramp and is easier to control.

TL;DR go GT or go home

PS. rode on the 32T, don't have 38T

LOL my sentiments exactly...why buy it if you're not going to use the mode its named after :p 

The difference between expert and pro mode (the d+ only mode) is noticeable -- but I'm pretty sure GT mode will be better than pro mode. Just not sure _how_ much better. At any rate, range and top speed will likely win me over with this board. I'll look to the Raptor to give me all the torque I want :)

Not saying you need to spend a fortune on latest and greatest, but relate it to putting cheap wheels on a high car.

Its not about money, in previous posts, me and some others like @mr_mahal simply dont like green wheels. Also, I tried getting legit Abec 11 97mm but they were sold out everywhere. I tried to buy a set despite the green color because I pretty much have all the wheels for it already, so I thought screw it, I'll have em all. I wouldn't have bought a set of Kegels in both orange and purple plus 4 gear drives at $30 each if I was trying to save money.

About the clones ride quality,  I haven't tried legit abec 11's but these clones are a bit hard and slide a bit on hard turns. Gets pretty scary but fun when you semi-drift. I was going to run my Orange kegels today to compare them because the sliding part can get a bit scary lol, but my GT broke today =( I wanted to see if it was just the ground, me or just the hard clone wheels thats causing a little loss of traction. Keep in mind, these are from pretty hard turns going pretty fast, in normal turns they are fine.

Poor choice of words on my part. I really just meant the whole DIY vs Completes thing. Everyone in this forum acknowledges that DIY allows you to control performance and always has bleeding edge tech. It doesn't really add much to the thread to start comparing DIY solutions to this board when it comes to performance because it is a completely different market -- sorta like comparing the latest PC tech to consoles.

Agreed, this guy is being a dick saying "grow up" sure sounds like @mr_mahal and @hobofarts are right, sounds like you are starting a fight and they makes a good point about the complete board vs DIY. Pretty much all of us here know about those types of boards and if we were interested (and how the hell do you know we aren't, I have GT but also looking into DIY for my 2nd board), then we would be all over those threads relating to that board. But not all of us are, so you should start your own thread and  keep this GT thread back topic. At least I know who the assholes are in this community, thanks for pointing yourself out.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L3O73Y8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

I got that because it is wider, but this other one I also ordered that I thought I wouldn't get in time seems denser and more protective against heavy direct wear:

I'd only put it on the clear spots, definitely *not* for grip tape. Your grip tape will be just fine lol. I may replace the grip tape in the future since it seems fairly straightforward and easy. Get some grip gum and you will be able clean your grip tape if it gets really really dusty/dirty -- also a brass brush to scrape of dirt or other weird things you find get in your grip.

What I was saying I was gonna do in addition to the bra is add little strips of grip a long the edges. For that I still have some spare grip tape left over and an entire new sheet. So will be experimenting with some patterns.

They all pretty much have about the same amount of adhesive, I guess it depends on how you apply it as to whether it will last. Making sure you go far enough to wear your feet won't start kicking it off is important, I will get a better idea of how I should do it once I have the board in person. 

I've experimented with two different branded grips, one from Grizzly and one from Vicious. Grizzly was fine and was nothing really special from standard grip tape, Vicious, a much more coarse and gritty grip tape helps you keep your feet locked in place -- DH long boarders highly recommend it. Did this mod to my boosted board and it was pretty effective, made the flexy deck somewhat tolerable as I needed something to keep me from falling off at high speeds since you tend to bounce around a lot maneuvering.

@mr_mahal excuse the crappy job, here are the areas where my board gets a lot of wear from my shoes, i ride with my right foot in front, kicking with my left foot obviously (as if you ever have to kick off with the GT mode on, definitely no kicking needed whatsoever) i didn't really notice any wear on the rear even tho under hard acceleration, a lot of my weight transfers over to my rear foot. Wear is mainly in the front area from turning i believe, i also put a lot of weight there once im up to speed<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fa9a675e27ad41a10f8602114406bcbd04e40e76.JPG" width="669" height="499">

Ah, so you ride goofy, seems like you should do the grip tape mod as well if your feet is touching the CF. Better than bra because it'll give you more stability. Hows the bottom of the deck holding up?

I get your point, no commercial board will ever have the performance of a DIY board.

Your board looks amazing, a true beast.  My custom board also beats out the evolve by far in performance.  

But a lot of people just don't want to put in the time and effort into building boards, they just want to buy and go out and ride.

As someone who just got their GT and have parts for my DIY on the way, the production GT is an amazing product with a high level of quality. The build, materials, finish, parts, and design are all top notch and I would dare say exceed most (but not all!) DIY projects.

That said, I cannot wait until I get my DIY finished because it's going to leave my GT in the dust.

The only reason people get emotional is because this thread is for discussion about "Evolve GT" not DIY.

Being an electric skateboard builders forum there are heaps of threads that you can compare DIY to completes. ( I would be happy to create one )

This thread is already so large due to the popularity of evolve products.

I don't want to play compare ( if i did i'd mention the display. Haven't seen any DIY guys with thats. Or Cf deck that nice )

Please keep on topic "Evolve GT"

Thanks
( I have never been on DIY forums comparing evolve )

Another option instead of the bra for the carbon, at least on the parts you don't step on, would be to spray a thick layer of clear plasti-dip. It would take a little prep to mask off the areas you don't want coated, but it would provide good protection and coverage, and can be peeled off cleanly at any time, if applied properly and thick enough. Works well enough on wheels and even whole cars in the  auto world, so should hold up for a while in this application.

www.dipyourcar.com is a good resource.

@caustin No, I'm referencing the edges where the CF would usually be on the front and rear sections. An owner applied thin pieces of grip tape to the sides of the GT, I don't think they are attached to the trucks...they just go on the CF and stick

@Mobutusan lol well they can't get it all right :p 

That's a reallllly interesting solution... I'd like to see someone try to damage it. But seems a little more complicated and might not be needed imo. Wills see how the bra works out.

**Evolve GT vs Boosted Dual Plus - My hill test results and comparison**

I know a video would be more engaging, but I'll leave that to some others who would no doubt make a better video than me anyway.  Instead I'm using my stopwatch (phone) and a bad-ass hill to come up with some real world stats to share.  Hopefully they're of interest to you. Also the fact that I own both boards puts me amongst a lucky few (for now) who can compare the two. 

I have the standard Evolve 83mm wheels, the Abec 11 97mm wheels and the 7 inch standard AT wheels.  I also have both the 32 (standard) and 38 tooth drive gears.  I tested the board in all configurations, as well as back to back with my Boosted Board Dual Plus (their current top of the range) in 'Pro' mode for a comparison.  

Here are some pics..

So I found the steepest hill I know of in my immediate vicinity, a 300m hill in Eltham (Victoria) which peaks at 23% and decided that this will be the basis of my initial tests.  I have 2 'check' points, one at about half way (1) and another at the end (2).  Make no mistake, this is a hill I would have absolutely zero chance of conquering on any previous Evolve.  Not even close.  In fact this hill really tests the Boosted to its limits.  At the steepest part of the hill (23%) the BBD+ almost comes to a halt but manages to keep going, just.  To me that really corroborates an earlier video posted by Evolve about a month or so ago where the Boosted didn't make it up a 25% hill.  That video is legit, no doubt.      

I started from stationary at the very base of the hill (ie no run up) which gradually winds up to 23% then levels off to almost flat for about 50 metres before winding up to 22% again and topping out at the 300m mark.  I measured the slope with the 'igradient' app on my iPhone. For your info, my weight on the day was about 90kgs (about 198lbs) fully kitted up, and the weather was 10 degrees C (50 degrees F) . 

I started with my BBD+.  (I've had this board for about 6 months and still performs as good as new.)  I performed this test at 100%, at 75%, and 50% battery levels.  Interestingly it performed identically at all levels. It wasn't till it dropped to more like 25% that there was a significant drop in performance.  Good work Boosted!  On the other hand, the battery on my Boosted literally only lasted _**10 minutes**_ in total whilst doing these tests!  I managed to travel only **_3km (1.9 miles)_** which was 1.5kms uphill and 1.5kms downhill to go from 100% battery to 0% battery!  As much as I love this board, that range is laughable.  Having said that, I do normally achieve between 6km and 10kms of range per battery on the Boosted, which is more respectable, and enough for many people, but obviously well short of Evolve's range.  My timings for the Boosted were as follows..

**Boosted Board Dual Plus (Pro)** : First check point (1) - **35 seconds**, 2nd check point (2) - **65 seconds.**  

I then swapped to the Evolve GT.  All tests were done in GT mode at at between 90% and 100% battery.  My first setup was on AT 7 inch tyres.  Exact same test.

**GT AT 7"** - (1) - **28 seconds**, (2) **58 seconds.**

Yep that's right!  The Evolve beats the Boosted by **7 seconds** even with the All Terrain tyres on!  That is mighty impressive in my opinion!  

The next day I tested the street setup.  The board was charged again to 100%.  I tested with the 83mm wheels first with 32T drive gear, then with 38T drive gear.  Then moved to the 97mm wheels in 32T and 38T.  The results were a little surprising.  Again all tests were done in GT mode.

**GT 83mm 32T** - (1) **23 seconds** (2) **46 seconds**

That's **12 seconds** faster to (1) and **19 seconds** faster to (2) than a BBD+.  What a machine!

My second and third run brought back slightly slower times, one or two seconds slower, indicating that maximum torque does gradually reduce pretty much as soon as battery drops below 100%. 

**2nd and 3rd runs:**
**GT 83mm 32T -** (1) **24 seconds** (2) **48 seconds**.  This is probably a more realistic time compared with the Boosted as it is the time you'd be able to achieve more often, not just at 100% battery.  Still a crapload faster than the BBD+ up the hill though, at **11 seconds** faster at the 150m checkpoint and **17 seconds** faster through the 300m checkpoint. 

My next test was with the same wheels but with the 38 tooth drive gear attached.  The results actually surprised me.

**GT 83mm 38T** - (1) **25 seconds,** (2) **51 seconds**.  I was expecting the shorter gearing of the 38T drive gear to get me up the hill even faster, but that wasn't the case.  In fact my times were 1 second slower than the same test with the 32T drive gear.  In one way I was a little disappointed, but in the other I was impressed.  The fact is that the GT has so much torque that it doesn't even need a lower gear to fly up that hill!  I'm sure if the hill was even steeper, then the lower gearing of the 38T would actually come into play, but with this hill the 32T did the job just as well.  Wow!  


My next test was with the 97mm Abec 11 Flywheels.  Gearing is higher with the 97mm wheels so I was very keen to see how it performed up hill compared with the 83mm wheels.  First with the 32T drive gear.

**GT 97mm 32T** - (1) **25 seconds**, (2) **50 seconds**.  YES!  I was so happy that the GT with 97mm wheels powered up this hill virtually just as well as the 83mm wheels.  It came within **2 seconds** and **4 seconds** respectively through the checkpoints, and felt just as fast.  Its great to know I can have the benefits of the 97mm wheels, such as more shock absorption and higher top speed (42kmh), but still have the torque to power up any hill.  Stoked!  The final setup I tested was the 97mm wheels with the 38T drive gear attached.

**GT 97mm 38T** - (1) **24 seconds** (2) **49 seconds.**  Again within 1 or 2 seconds of the 32T times, and as expected, virtually identical to the 83mm/32T setup which has the same overall gearing as this 97mm/38T set up and the same top speed at 35kmh.  

As a final test I tried a couple of setups in 'FAST' mode, ie one step down from 'GT' mode.  In short, for my weight and a very steep slope, I wouldn't bother.  It gets up the hill, but really struggles and takes a long time.  If you're tackling steep hills I would just leave it in GT mode.  These were my times in FAST mode:

**GT 83mm 32T FAST mode** - (1) **55 seconds** (2) **105 seconds, (31 and 58 seconds slower than GT mode)**
**GT 83mm 38T FAST mode** - (1) **50 seconds** (2) **93 seconds (25 and 42 seconds slower than GT mode)**

My conclusions from the hill tests are that no matter what setup you use on the Evolve GT, as long as you have it in GT mode, you are going to power up a hill, and will destroy any Boosted Board!  Also I don't see a need for a 38T drive gear, or even the 83mm Evolve wheels for that matter.  The 97mm Abecs with the 32T gear will be the setup I run in street all the time.

Up to 42kmh top speed, better (as in slightly less sensitive) throttle and brake, smoother ride and virtually the same hill climbing ability for 99.99% of hills in Victoria means that:  

EVOLVE GT + 97MM ABECS + 32T DRIVEGEAR = A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN!




**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I've had about 2.5 years worth of experience on e-boards and I've got to say up until now, the Boosted Board, which was my 8th e-board, was my absolute favourite.  It's very nicely built, looks nice, is very reliable, has plenty of torque, is light, well balanced and has a nice fun flexy Loaded deck.  In addition to that it has an intuitive and precise remote. It's achilles heel has always been its range, although we know this has been somewhat improved with the upcoming Version 2.  Everything else on Boosted V2 is only marginally improved, and for that reason, in my opinion it falls behind the GT now.    

Having owned the GT for 10 days, I can confidently say that the GT is quite easily my new favourite board.  Not only does it have at least 3-6 times the range of the Boosted, it has more torque, more power, higher top speed, great carving with wider and better carving trucks, quieter motors, the ability to change wheels and gears, and a remote control with speed and trip meter displayed.  In addition to that I think it's the sexiest board out there.  

I haven't yet gone down the route of DIY boards yet, but to be honest, the GT is the first board to actually do everything I want in an e-board, so don't have any real desire to build my own just yet.  I guess the closest competitor in the DIY field at the moment is the Enertion Raptor. I've ridden a couple and although they have even more torque than the GT, I think the GT is a better overall board. It carves much better, rides much more smoothly (especially with 97s) has a better remote, has a quieter drivetrain, better looking IMO, and of course the option to switch to AT tyres in under 10 minutes.  Nevertheless I'd like to see how much faster a Raptor could get up my test hill.  @Dedbny when you're ready, so am I!


Here's a couple of pics back in April of the 2 boards together during a group ride. I was lucky enough to get a few minutes on the Raptor and a GT beta test board!

Anyway, sorry about the long post, but if anyone out there is on the fence about the GT, maybe all this makes things a little clearer.

Safe riding! 
Mick :relaxed:

Don't be sorry, it is a very nice post. I have a GT and I was almost too lazy to switch wheels just one time. Meanwhile, you are switching wheels left and right, doing tests + collecting data, and so on. Thank you very much for the post. (My GT is being sent back tho, battery issue it seems)...and so, I am bored as hell and love reading this stuff.

This was very very comforting to hear since I was able to include the 97's in my order at the last second. I'll be picking up the board in about 8 hours exactly (gotta sleep then head to pick up from the post). Excellent testing and I can't wait to do something similar. Really really useful info and I'm sure people will appreciate this. Damn it if you made this a video it would be epic....I have a friend who's getting his boosted back soon so I will try to recreate this and credit you for the testing ideas.

GREAT WORK! :D

I thought you had them already? But yeah, they might have some left. A buddy of mine who is also getting his board with me tomorrow was able to score some and so I tried to do it as well same day and was successful. I'd email them again during business hours -- they should respond.. Resources are limited though which is why I think they didn't list them on their site. Everyone is sold out as you know and I believe Nords will be getting them back in stock in about a week if you can't get them from Evolve.

Be careful with the fast charger, it will degrade your battery cells over time. I opted out of buying it for that reason. Also, the standard recharges about 5-10% more than the fast one. No fan for the slow one either. Overall, most Evolve owners recommend it over the fast.

looks like the DIY vs evolve GT discussion is coming up again.  I think for like over 90% of people the evolve GT is the ideal board.  It has the looks, has ridiculous torque and range, and is so versatile with the AT wheels.  The remote is awesome as well.  I don't see DIY boards offering anything more than what the evolve GT offers.  If I was going to have one board, it would be the evolve GT no doubt.   

You can get more performance out of DIY terms of speed, but how many people actually need more than 26 mph (42 km/h)?  That's very fast on a board under your feet with wheels so small compared to other vehicles that you can fit them in your hand.  If you look around some of the DIY AT boards built on this forum they can hit near 40 mph WITH AT wheels which is insane.  So unless you have a very specialized need and prioritize that level of performance over anything else, and are willing to put in the time/effort to build one of your own (or pay to have someone build it for you lol)... the evolve GT is overall better.

I'm not trying to bring back that discussion. There are plenty of threads to continue that, and I started one haha. 
Don't get me wrong, I completely get the DIY thing, and it does still interest me, but the biggest thing was building something to do what I wanted and others potentially couldn't. Atm the GT is doing that for me. 
A crazy rad all terrain build would be great, but at what expense, in both time and money? 
I'm sure I'll still look at that road every now and then but I'll admit it'll feel like a bit of a trade off with a lot of aspects and with potentially little benefit for what I need and want.

Love the comparison mate. Maybe one thing you should do is tell use the weight of the boards also?

I would say the gt weighs a lot more, but the toss up between power range and weight is what we all need to make!

Hey Rob.Endless! I see you bought the 97 Flywheels clones to have them in black, which is what a lot of us have been wanting to do until we saw that they didn't fit the drive gears while it looks like they do on the product picture.

So some of us have been talking about modding them but it seems like you're the only one who's actually done it, can you give more info about this? 

Why did you mod the drive gears and not the wheel instead, by making the holes bigger? 
How did you mod the drive gears?
Are you happy with the result? 

Cheers

@olivierdud I currently have my GT being sent back for repair/replacement and so I kept all my eboard stuff hidden at my parents garage so that I wont be reminded that I even have an eboard. It really sucks being one of the first non-beta testers to have the GT in the US (I had it  at 8am wednesday last week) When I get it back, I can posts more pics of the modification. To answer you questions, I modded the gear drives because I already had an extra set of abec gear drives. It also seemed a lot easier to do and more precisely. It also allows me to buy whatever wheels and have them fit (as i have stock abec drives, modded abec drives, AT drives and kegel drives) . I used a digital caliper to take measurements and a dremel and file to get it done. I am happy with the results as it spins truly with no wobble.

Do I need to tighten trucks or should I just switch to 97mm ABEC's for speed?
(When I say speed, I mean riding the streets lol. I figured AT would ride it fine but maybe it's too high off from the ground?)


I got my GT with MrMahal today, but anyways. I took it out for a ride 15 minutes ago and went down the street going GT mode (I'm familiar with the speed from BB D+ and I handled the carvability of the board well because I had beaq trucks on my old longboard that would lean down just as far! I was fine going around so I kept GT mode going and downhill I let go of accelleration and it hit 24mph and I was like shit lemme slow down but then I wobbled and fell off. Only a few scrapes and scratches on my gear and I'm perfectly fine. I was full throttle because BB D+ belts would always create enough drag that I barely went over top speed but I wasn't ready for this. Any advice? :o Anything appreciated.

(I have the GT 2 in 1 with 83mm evolve wheels and Abec 97mm and the AT wheels)

edit: I think it started wobbling when I noticed 24mph and considered braking, but braking currently gives me slight wobbles but not enough that I considered it wobbles....?)

I tightened my trucks when I got them because going 20+mph wobbling all over was pretty scary. If you plan to get 97's make sure to tighten. Go easy when braking and lean back when you do so. Try not to overcompensate when wobbling.

Also if you want 97's they have just 1 more set at evolve if you email/call them.

Ok will tighten!

I do have the 97mm's already from evolve, I paid and they just stuck it in my GT box:3

Yeah I'm getting used to the remote, I was pretty good at any speed until I found 24mph xD...
Tbh so far, I think the Boosted Board remote is much more natural and easy to control. So far anyways. Been a total of 12 hours with only 2 of riding xD

Yea the faster you go the harder it is to control, especially with the dual bushings. You may want to consider getting harder bushings as well, though if you practice enough you should be able to control the 97's.

Yeah If you want to skate at speed (25kmh+) I would highly recommend hard bushings and tightening your trucks.( first thing I do, also upgrade bearings.)
If your trucks are too loose you will notice when you get to higher speeds especially when you apply the brakes. Also having your belt tensions even should help keep board balanced while braking.

The trigger on the remote is touchy in GT mode.  Something you get used to and I've come to like it a lot. It lets you have as much power as it can give.

Hey guys, sorry I haven't posted anything as today's events with @HoboFarts were very unexpected to say the least lol One big word of advice for those that are getting the 2 in 1 in a month or so is that if you haven't ridden on pneumatic big wheels, or double kingpin trucks, switch to street first and get used to the carvyness of the truck. The higher center of gravity is no joke. I never actually got to GT mode because I kept wobbling all over the place. A lot of shit happened in between with me trying to swap in my own bushings (I anticipated there'd be something wrong with evolves because they don't know my weight) and eventually I bailed hard getting a nice smack on the head and a little road rash. I feel so thankful for @RunPlayBack and his message because that thread made me get extra pads that saved me some skin and extra damage, and reminded me to keep my helmet snug. It happened so quick and I could barely react. 

Besides that unfortunate part of the day, I was really impressed with this board in terms of quality. It looks abso-fucking-lutely gorgeous in person and is so balanced in weight not even the AT set up felt all that heavy to me honestly. So far taming the truck on this has been my only gripe. I haven't tested GT mode so I'm not sure how sensitive the break is in comparison to Fast, but I kinda like it as it is, I can fine tune pretty well even with gloves on. 

The footage I got of the unboxing was a bit fucked due to me shooting into the sun (we did this in a parking lot mid day) and my face is a little hard to see, also didn't mic myself up. Kinda too excited to do anything proper so I'll be working more on that tomorrow as I heal :)

If you don't put more loctite on at some stage, after switching kits. The vibration from skating will eventually loosen screws and you will need to re apply. ( mediuym strength )

Streets are awesome and feel more like a skateboard for carving but there is something cool about riding with a friend( on mountain bike ). Over grass, dirt, road. All with complete ease. Or when the bike path is full of people, just pull around them on the grass.

I tend to change them a bit but find more use for ATS in my area.

Overtaking bikes will never ever get old. Even on original carbon, Now heaps more acceleration, grip and power.

I snapped the end of an allen key (my own, not the one supplied) when I first changed over. Conversely, I nearly lost an engine mount screw after a prolonged period on street wheels going over paved roads. So I reapplied medium (blue) strength loctite to the one bolt that came lose. Just be careful, if one of those screws comes loose it'll like end up between the belt and pulley, damaging both.  

Be careful on the rides mate, even if you are experienced all new machines need a period of learning. I tightened up my trucks progressively until I found the sweet spot for me. Now I can GT around no issues. But I tend to spend more time carving. Just did a 31km ride, mix between eco (gentle downhill), fast (undulating) and GT (power back home). Still had 42% battery although my voltage sagged (down to 4%) significantly if trying GT up steep hills at that point. So I imagine I was a bit further down than the indicator suggested. 

Has anyone else got anything stuck in  belt cover yet? I got a stone or something that managed to land in there and it gouged a groove into the top of my belt (all the way around) until it spat itself out a few seconds later. The belt is fine functionally , but is bished up on the top layer. Just unlucky but a risk with exposed belts and a partial belt cover.

@Mr_Mahal and @HoboFarts both crashed on the first day of having your evolve GTs?  ouch, but good thing you both were wearing gear.  

It's funny cuz I had to bail today also but I'm perfectly okay, but totally not my fault.... I had a brake failure while going downhill with an intersection at the end.  My first instinct was to pull off a heelside slide like I'm doing DH, but couldn't do it with those grippy wheels and that 21 lb board.  So I fell on my knee pads and gloves and slid out momentum and then got back up with no issues, just slight embarrassment.  This was my first (and totally unexpected) brake failure.  I'm currently talking to LHB about it.    

Even with streeth wheels at 24 mph it will wobble more than the boosted until your stabilizer muscles get trained.  If you guys think things are twitchy at 24 mph, you should try 35+ mph lol.

Yeah, you are right @photorph, stabilising muscle memory probably has a lot to do with it.

Good to hear you survived the failure in tact. Real shame it happened, hopefully you can sort out the issue. I feel brakes and brake confidence is critical, it allows you to push the limits a bit more. At least you had DH experience and worked through iut. Did the board survive ok?

I said this a long time ago @Maxid, but Jeff confirmed its 360 Wh. I can open up the board tomorrow (about to go to sleep), but it makes sense considering the charge times.

@magnetvox How the fuck did you get the board stiff? Lol excuse my language, but I'm having the hardest time in the world trying to get this thing stiff like a regular kingpin truck. What are duro/types of bushings do you have on it? Could you get it stiff enough to where it can't make sharp turns easily? I am trying so hard to learn how to tame this truck but idk how people do 20+mph with it. It's just so difficult....I feel like I've never ridden an eboard...damn it just hurts my pride lol Either something is wrong with my truck or just nothing works. I have the fattest venom eliminators on it, 90 and 94 duro bushings, and stiff cones of the same rating (which I have to use at the bottom 2nd tier truck because nothing else fits) all tightened down as much as possible. Yet the board mocks me as it just wiggles when I barely step on it.    

@Photorph yeah I had no idea this thing would be so hard to maneuver..AT wheels are on a whole other level. Street is still giving me some issues. Also, slow mode is not good for beginners because it has cut outs due to the programming of the remote or something which can cause it to delay the break or not throttle...eco mode and above it's pretty sensitive but I never went to it in my 10 minute run just now because I didn't want to kill myself lol This will take more work than I thought and idk when I'm gonna have time to make a video tbh...I can't even get to GT mode yet because of this. I have to mod my bushings so I can get rid of cones entirely, the axel is not long enough for bigger bushings.

**_This goes to Everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!_**

Please be careful at high speeds, always wear helmets and protective gear. Get used to your brake! Look ahead! If you haven't skated on the path before slow down!!!

I have come off at full speed twice on old board, but not on GT yet ( touch wood )
This pastime can easily be fatal. Caution first, then build up to full speed if comfortable.

After I fell second time my friend said" always ride within your limits" This haunts me as i'm riding and haven't fallen at high speed since.

So guy's "**_Ride within your limits!!!!!!!!_**"

@Mr_Mahal I just tightened pretty much exactly as @darkydawson said. I'm using the stock bushings, and I'm not considering changing- they work. I found more stability came from tightening the rear over the front. Still retained the carving ability, probably better than before because I can lean in deeper at higher speed with more stability. I've never used double kingpin before but my sense is the top kingpin/ bushing can be quite tight, and you retain the carve in the lower. Could be talking out my backside but my board went front almost impossible to balance even at low speed, to rock solid, high speed, great carve with maybe a full turn tighten on the front (top and bottom), and two on the rear. Keeping in mind I probably improved in balance/ stability too after 4 hours or so of riding over a couple days.

@Mr_Mahal coming from the boosted any board will seem more difficult to ride.  The boosted is the easiest board to ride that I've ever ridden.  It's really the perfect board for beginners.  I've ridden 3 E-boards total (soon to be 4 with the raptor), and boosted was just effortless.  I was going full throttle on pro mode first day and totally comfortable.  

The raptor and the GT will take more time to adjust to.

@Mr_Mahal do you have any non electric longboards lying around? Might be worth it to get some gullwing sidewinder II's and ABEC's to practice the feel of riding on double kingpins. I always ride on sidewinders on my non electrics and keeps my muscle memory intact when I transition to my eboards. Always good to have that balance.

Ok, Here is a mini review and purchasing story for novice riders in the 40+ crowd  :slight_smile:

First off a little about myself.  I'm 5' 11" 220 and 42 years old and live in Northern Caliofrnia (Bay Area) and I bought my first Esk8 board from E-Glide back about 6 years ago. I bought 2 E-Glide boards, 1 street and the other AT and they used large sealed Lead Acid batteries and weighed anywhere from 50-70 lbs. I would say I road them mostly in the summer and a couple of times a week. (they were great for lazy dog walking)  About 2 years ago the SLA batteries just weren't doing it anymore and I shelved them in the garage and got into Drones.


Fast forward to April this year and I ran across some great downhill youtube videos (Fails) and then saw some videos of the Raptor and started my research to get a new state of the art Esk8 board. Looked hard at Metro Board and had several great emails with Ian.  He even has a new RF remote to replace the IR that he offered up in a new build.  I also had an email with Jason and how long I would have to wait for a Raptor.  I keep researching and ran across Evolve and the pending GT.  Made up my mind and setup a computer BOT to tell me when the EvolveUSA site changed and starting taking orders.  I had my order in within 2 minutes of the site going live but my credit card company thought my card was being used oddly and rejected the purchase.  I had to call Visa and tell them yes, this 40+ year old wants a $2K skateboard, please let the charge through.  So once that was done my order was in for a Street version.

Fast forward to Last Friday 6/24 - Set the UPS to pickup and got it at lunch time.  Charged it up and did a few laps around work parking lot in Slow mode to get the hang of it.  Rode about 6 more miles that night. (Econo mostly)  Didn't get much riding in over the weekend because it's been crazy hot and I like AC too much.  I've been doing most of my riding at dusk as it cools down out.  Thanks to @MR_Mahal I ordered an AT kit and Abec 97's that got here yesterday and put them on last night.

Review time - 97's are the shit. Softer, more forgiving and just feel more planted.  Will never go back to the 83's. Road for about 9 more miles on the 97's last night and tightened the trucks a little more.  Starting to get them dialed in. Most of my riding was in Econo mode with the 83's, the torque sucks but once you get going it's very quiet and plenty of speed (for me at least)  I tend to carve around 13-16 mph which is a very relaxed riding speed for me.  Anything more and I feel I really need to pay attention to what I'm doing and don't enjoy the ride as much. My ankles can feel it and I can't ride for anymore than 5 or 6 miles at a time without stepping off for a bit but having a great time. Now that I'm on the 97's I have moved up to Fast but still tend to ride at about 14-15 mph on average.  I might go a little faster as I build up muscles and muscle memory but anything over 20mph is going to send me to the hospital if I fall.  The hospital isn't from the fall, it's from my wife kicking my ass for getting hurt riding a Skateboard.

So there are many more people on the forums that are more knowledgeable than I, but ask away if you have any questions.

Guys, just got back from a 6 mile ride. Practiced some surfing stances and kinda figured out how to counterbalance the board using my lead foot toe, and rear foot heel (vice versa for turning). Surfing on land is kinda awesome and relaxing. Got up to GT mode but never hit max speed. Just wanted to see the acceleration. 

As my right foot gets stronger I think my stance will be very stable and I'll have no problem stabilizing for straight line speed. It's awesome sidewalk surfing because I can get around anything without ever leaving the board. It's a beastly truck to master but has so many benefits when you do. not sure how long it'll be before I hit the streets hard, but I'll be enjoying it as is.

Yup, I don't think I could ride on sidewalks without them or AT. Very smooth and similar to AT but you still feel it. Just not as bad. I try not to ride too hard on sidewalks because the vibration makes things loose, but I'm still getting comfortable with the board. Probably have only put 10 miles on it. Just now getting down the throttle response and good at fine tuning. Taking it real slow because I'm humbled by the board and still kinda injured lol

I try to keep my belts on the loose side. As long as teeth don't skip when braking hard on street setup. On AT I have them so teeth will skip a little with very hard braking. This should serve as a good guideline. If you run too tight you will get more noise/friction. Can slow you down a little.

Don't want anything coming loose unintentionally though.

Also, do you guys know what a loud popping noise means when you carve hard? I hear it near the front trucks. I'll be making a 360 turn and carve hardddd and hear a little pop, like a nut coming off.

@Mr_Mahal

This clicking is your bearings moving slightly from the seating in 7in wheels. You can try greasing outside of bearing( lithium grease ), this doesn't stop the movement but the noise. Only should happen when carving at speed.. ( I talked with Evolve AUS about this )

Good bearings. 
I prefer oust moc9 airrr. American steel, re-designed non contact seal. Ultra polished raceways.
Oust bearings have been re-designed specifically for skating, most other bearings still run off basic fan/washer design.
The worlds top downhill slalom guys ride oust, as they are made to take lateral and torsional loads.

I've been riding on them for 6months+ on my old board(carbon) and only serviced once. ( They still spin for about 5min by hand )

To be honest....
It makes me smile that the GT gives you a hard time.
There is a reason DH guys make jokes about the double kingpin trucks. They suck! Double bushings = double trouble!
These trucks aren't made to go 35 + kph.
An experienced rider will handle the wobbles because of strong ankles, but a noob will street his face.
You have a massive wheelbase on the GT and still trouble with speed wobbles? The Raptor has a smaller wheelbase with normal RKT and drives great at 45 kph.
I don't want to discredit Evolve, but for non skateboard people the GT will be painful...

Although double kingpin trucks will always feel different to single. I prefer this setup on a longboard. I find I can tighten them and still have descent turn. Especially comfortable when riding AT fast.

I never personally had a problem going 35kmh+ on Carbon or GT. With hard bushings.

Gotta admit I do like the look of the Raptor. Useable kick and more like a normal skateboard feel.

I have ridden the sidewinders on some regular longboards and really don't like them.
There are made for some carving next to the beach to impress some chicks, but nothing more.
Talking about 45 kph (yes I love the metric system 😄) on an eboard or an normal longboard is completely different as well.
Without a break 45 kph are scary, but with the confidence of it it's so easy. Skateboarding is a skill and only a fraction depends on the material.
Anyways sidewinder trucks are dangerous at higher speeds. Ask @whitepony he seems to be legit in the users opinion.
I like the most on the GT and love the range, but can't see any point beside that where the Raptor wouldn't rape it.
Sorry just my two cents!

Have you tried a regular RKT on a downhill ride?
It is less twichy and gives you more confidence. IMO there is not a single argument for the sidewinder trucks. You have to ride such a big lean on the skateboard to make a turn. The concept is so inaccurate and non intuitive for the user.
Of course you can make them stiff to go faster, but a normal truck can do the same just better.

In your opinion and thats cool. ( I will say again, I find when you set them up correctly you get stiffness but when you push harder you can feel the second stage kick in. ) Single are more stable for sure.

Rape is a strong word.

Isn't raptor like 2kmh faster? I believe it goes up hills better.

Great feedback!
In my opinion the problem is like you said "if you set it up correct" the biggest problem it the complexity of the system.
I see a lot of people struggling to set up two bushings on their skateboards. If you are speaking pro you have different bushings on top/down and front/rear. How many bushings do I have to buy to have nice sidewinders? The possible combinations are endless if you start to think about coned bushings as well.

Okay rape is hard to say, but dominate is cool!
Yes there are the two kph more, but there is more. 
Less wheelbase = smaller turns
real trucks = stable at 45 kph
Kicktail = better low speed maneuvering
Top mount deck = more responsible
fully customizable = it will be what I want

Expect in the duration of a ride I will wipe the floor with the GT in the city, a downhill or a bike lane.

2 in 1 really is a cool feature!
But aren't there above enough reasons why I think the GT isn't able to handle this?
Check out @Nowind eskate....
If you want performance on pneumatics that's how it looks like.

The GT maybe is a all in one, but worthless if it can't do anything right.

This is an asinine argument. Different horses for different courses. I suspect there are more fan-boys in this forum than meets the eye, and most aren't regulars in this thread. These trucks carve beautifully. Want to downhill at pace or set land speed records, get the appropriate set up that works for you, no brainer. I'll refer you back to @onloops post in this thread previously, please don't mention the raptor in this thread. IMO, if we want to play those rules, then it goes both ways. No need piss up against the wall, plenty of other threads to debate how you made an awesome decision based on what works for you. If you want to talk about "rape", open a new thread and we can all talk intermittent vescs, mysterious settings, quality control issues, battery build issues, defective and bulky controllers,  distribution, delivery times, reputation, customer service, aesthetics, range, and whatever else you choose to ignore when bouncing into this thread to big note yourself.  I've never ridden a long board or e-skate board before and these trucks are are fine for the design philosophy they are seeking to meet. Also, lets remember physics. It's impossible to have the 'perfect board', every decision is a trade off on requirements. Also, intuition is as subjective as common sense. Back on topic.

Finally took delivery of my GT today, thanks to all the early GT riders for posting their experiences as it helped me get up and running faster and avoid some of the first time foibles.  Though I got the 2-in-1, I resisted starting on the AT wheels where i have less experience and immediately swapped out to street version. Though I have ridden gullwings alot, given issues folks had with the double kingpin trucks I cranked them down aggressively to start.  I weigh 190lbs so when I say aggressively, I mean for rear top tier truck throw away skate key toy and torque them up with 14 wrench leverage <g>.  I let them loose after awhile, and still waiting on my stepped bushings, trying Venom DH Elim 97A on top  tiers and looking for suggestions on the bottom tier to match...anyone??

All I have to say is that I want a Raptor and still do. I also eventually want a DIY board ( trampa or a 12s4p dual carvons). However, I wanted to ride now, as in ASAP....and guess what, if I had ordered my Raptor first, I wouldn't even have an eboard yet, not even close. I can enjoy my GT now and not get "raped" by my own Raptor because I wouldn't even have it yet. I have no regrets, this board rides fine for me and looks like a work of art, plus the controller is bad ass.

I have 85a venom eliminators on my top and bottom tier for the front trucks. Still wiggles a bit, I weigh around 155. I think you made a good choice with the hardest eliminators. Definitely works better than barrels. Just cancelled my order for harder barrels because I was able to fit my eliminators on the front truck. Probably gonna put both pink ones on the rear truck because it turns way too much. Great for carving and I have learned how to ride with it, but I prefer worrying about the front truck.

@Tarzan , I still have a Raptor on order. Due hopefully within the next 3 weeks. I miss the caliber trucks because they make it very easy to go fast. It was a wise choice by Boosted to put them on because it's what makes eboarding so simple to pick up. 

HOWEVER, maneuvering with your whole body is something I kinda really like. Granted, the only reason it's so good for me now is because I cruise on the sidewalk, it's incredibly easy to move around obstacles, plus your really do surf on land. I've learned to love it, but it has it's pains. The stance I had to adopt to eliminate speed wobbles isn't comfortable, but very functional and I'll only get better. I also noticed half the time speed wobbles (for me at least) are caused by two things, weak stabilizer muscles and lack of confidence. 

I was very confident going at the slow speeds I was earlier today. Accelerating braking was all easy. I didn't push it too far because I am still recovering, but have no doubt I will get it down because if I do the freedom with this trucks turn radius and the fun I have **actually** surfing on the street is hard to be matched. No fucking way I could do what I do now on a caliber lol A kick tail is great, but being able to just use your whole body in a fluid motion to navigate terrain is amazing.

This thing is not for beginners, I'm surprised @Rob.Endless picked it up so easily, though if I wasn't so used to the calibers I probably could've picked this up a bit easier. It's hard reprogramming yourself. Overall I wouldn't trade this board for a Raptor. It may have its quirks, but it got delivered quickly, the support has turned out to be awesome, quality control is on a whole other level (more so than even Boosted I believe), and the range is incredible. Not to mention torque and whatnot...you just can't go wrong. 

Sorry to bring this off topic but just wanted to share these thoughts :p

Screw all that, this guy is an obvious asshole. I pretty much read almost all the topics here on the forum and not just this one. I thought this guy was cool, totally lost respect for him tho.

It's hard to be unbiased about boards you either own/made. Everyone always says their board is the best because of xyz, and neglects problems abc. I was the same way with Boosted, and then I wasn't...now, I just want to ride and this board rides good enough for me to enjoy. It's work, but I enjoy the hell out of it and it's just as much of a challenge as it was my first day of eboarding on a dual +. In the end you are rewarded with the many benefits being able to move truly freely has. I expect on my commute tomorrow it will be very handy with all the pesky pedestrians :)

That sound is likely the washer bumping against the kingpin. The washers inner diameter is a little larger than the kingpin, so it slides back and forth. After a few days of riding it should stop clicking like that! (The washer needs to "settle in" to the profile of the baseplate, and then it will stay still!)

It is safe to ride with that sound as long as all the other nuts and bolts are tightened properly.  Happened on my normal longboards all the time.

Going to apply the 3M clear bra film tomorrow, plus grip tape in the high wear area in the pic I previously posted. It will also cover the CF blemish from my lead foot so that I will never have to see it again. It is like a new phone, eventually I will care less about scratches and all that stuff.

I applied the bra but only on the belly. And it was a nasty job. Tried doing it without water because I was nervous about it leaking into the board. But this 3M stuff for ~$20 is no joke, I tested it before and even with the sharpest knives I have it doesn't penetrate easily. Very clear and damn near invisible if you apply it perfectly. I put grip tape on all edges and it's helped tremendously. Will be doing a neater job in a few and post pics. I'm using vicious grip tape which matches the CF very nicely and sparkles in the light a bit : p

It should hold up really well, these things are used on cars and last for several years under the hot sun without discoloring. I haven't had any plans on putting it on the bottom because I am not sure how to shape it around. The top seems easy, its pretty much just flat. I looked into the two brands you mentioned in previous posts about grip tapes. I say put a little patch of clear bra where the nose guard foam makes contact with the bottom of the deck, dirt, dust plus vibrations may cause clear coat damage. If you haven't already that is.

I haven't put anything on the nose actually. The big ass abecs / AT wheels protect it from most curb impacts so I haven't issues with it. Will probably do it for good measure but not too concerned. I'm not riding in the street hard yet so I don't think it's gonna get as dirty as my BB did quickly. I put it on the belly because I wanted the branding to remain looking nice :p will probably take it off though since it looks really bad with a lot of wrinkles and air bubbles. Kind a gave up and just threw it on however it would fit lol

on the topic of sidewinders & bushings: Ive ridden an evolve carbon for 1.5years nearly daily, most often at max speed and what I leanrt about the sidewinders:

I dont like them at all :laughing:


but I can tell very well where they are coming from: someone wanted to make a stiff and light carbon board that can support internal electronics, but whoever build it (jeff annings) also wanted a turny surfy feel, playing with energy returns, all the things you can do with a flexy cruiser deck.

the sidewinders are able to emulate that a little bit - with their dbl kingpin they are quite soft and dampen vibrations quite well, with their 2nd stage kingpin they add turnyness and somewhat snappy energy returns which feels a little like a flexy deck and energy returns of the board.

in my eyes, jeff did the only thing that was possible for him.


nevertheless, sidewinders arent really great trucks in my eyes. they are not very precise, the board is superhigh above the ground and that "snap" of the trucks is just not the same as precise smooth trucks with a snappy deck. most people dont manage to tame the sidewinders, witnessed by the numerous videos about people fallingg off an evolve after speed wobbles. :yum:

I think they can be tamed, but in the end that most often means you make the 2nd kingpin quite dead which essentially leaves you more or less with a fairly imprecise single kingpin truck and in my eyes there are plenty better out there. :stuck_out_tongue:

I spend a whole weekend and a box of bushings worth 200€ trying to dial in the feeling I wanted from my evolve. I ended up with semi-dead boardside kingpins, a pretty stiff rear roadside and a medium front roadside. wasnt really any other way for me to enjoy carving beyond 30kph and to get the trucks to follow my lines halfway well.

What do you think would happen if someone were to run sold aluminum or steel bushings on one of the trucks and urethane on the other? Or maybe one solid and one urethane on each kingpin? Could that possibly dial out some of the excess movement of the trucks and make them more stable at speed, or would that cause other problems?

think there are a lot of reasonable middle grounds of low speed maneuverability, surfy cruising fun, comfortable damping and sufficient stability for evolves max kph. 

my vanguard for example is awesome and surfy at mid to high speeds, very stable at 45kph, but its maneuverability is really bad at low speed when you cant really flex the deck into a strong rocker and artificially increase the truck angle. 50degree calibers with a 42" deck isnt enough at low speeds. my evolve had a smaller turning radius, so thats one of the few food things about of those sidewinders.

@Tarzan I feel I need to weigh in on the truck concern. 
I'm a fairly noob rider, with so minimal background in skating. Few goes on older evolves, and random boards, and now the GT. 
I have to say as a novice rider I actually don't really have any issues. Adjustment wasn't difficult to find my happy spot, and I comfortably sit pinned in GT.
I had heard people having concerns regarding sidewinders so was asking around heaps before buying. (as people have prob seen me asking questions here) one guy from fb page was saying while they share similar design, the angle and geo are potentially different.
Also the GT has wider axle than their previous. 

Basically at the end of the day, I don't really have any issues and I'm happy with it. 
Like everything eboard, saying something is categorically right or wrong isn't really correct. 
@Mobutusan you be messing with the entire operation of geo I'd think. Plus as @whitepony stated ride quality issues. And I think noise too.

@Mr_Mahal you should put your noseguard on asap, if you have not already.  I just cracked my front end in a wipeout and had to install my noseguard post mortem.  Its an easy install, just need to drill out the two bolt holes furthest from the tip.  Worth getting 1" truck bolts to replace the 3/4" ones as the noseguard adds 1/4" to the height.  Will have to match hardware down the road, just used what I had on hand standard 1" flat head Philips screw bolts an resused same nuts,

You don't drill the GT, just the noseguard so that it matches existing GT holes!!

For those who think their wheels will protect their deck nose, yes if brick wall but no if guard rail, for example.  I will post a picture of what a guard rail, or signpost, etc will do to your CF nose at 20+mph,  Its not pretty, and no size wheel is going to protect that.

Ouchhh, damnnn. I purchased two nose guards and I installed them today but took them off because they were loud as hell. I ran out of time to fix the issue. I will fix it Thursday after work. 

I just got my GT back Wednesday morning and I have been working on it all day today. I had an area where the clear coat was coming off. I wet sanded the area with 2000 grit and then 3000 grit. Afterwards, I masked off the entire board minus the target area, I sprayed multiple layers of clear coat, of course giving it time to dry. After it fully dried, I wet sanded the area again with 3000 grit to blend the surface because the new clear coated area was a bit higher than the rest of the board. I finished it off with some rubbing compound or whatever it was, buffed the crap of it. The results were really good. Remember this pic? Well this was at its early stage, once it started the clear coat damage spreads fast.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/8282e49c9eb1028531a8c0dec8be5c2d1b8716bf.JPG" width="669" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c496470ee29448c9c04e9d31ecd1bf46d18eb778.JPG" width="669" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6ca9a347af6e459ae95f1bc29bec0acafba29d7e.JPG" width="669" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a4324fe8892847f07ec66f5c12be7c50ccf918d1.JPG" width="669" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2bc427ba48f96db8959919041b4150a3763ce3b5.JPG" width="669" height="499">

Also, forgot to mention, after the carbon fiber clear coat repair, I cleaned the board and put the 3M clear bra on. Noticed the clear coat damage was near the front left wheel and now take a look at the pic afterwards, it turned out great. BTW, Evolve sent me a free hat with the board =)

@caustin, you can try to do something similar. If that was my board, I would first make the surface as even as possible, take off all the crap sticking out, fill it with something (not sure with what at the moment, perhaps some black resin or something, wet sand carefully! with high grit to get it smooth and to get the shape of the nose back right. re-clear coat the area and then try to do what I did after. It should turn out great, it will be shaped back to normal and the area with no CF will just be black and hardly noticeable. Also, it will shine like its brand new again.

@mr_mahal working out the air bubbles out of the 3M clear bra is a pain in the a## I still have a few air bubbles, oh well , it will get scratched up eventually anyways.

I had 35% battery life left and charged it yesterday and took a little over 5 hours to charge. The same day (yesterday), I purchased a fast charger.  It finished charging around midnight :( and so I went for another midnight run for an hour and half with only street lights....kind of risky. It would have just taken piece of stick/little branch or good size rock to send me off flying on GT mode. So yeah, it does take a long time to charge with the standard charger.

If you left the power button on (pushed in) and it timed out, you have to release it for 5-10seconds and turn back on. 
I've left mine on couple times. Thankfully has a time out feature. 
Also I wouldn't worry about the remote showing 100% and it still charging. I've ridden up to 10km, come to a stop, and the battery % can creep back to 100%, but still take charge when I got home.

Slightly tangential, but as folks are addressing battery/range/charging, I did a quick test yesterday to see how long/far I would go on a single battery charge and then how long it took on standard charger to get back to green light/100%/42.3V.  Specifics won't be precisely relevant to others as I wanted to know how long/far I should budget for my rides, but for what it is worth I am 190lbs and temperature was 85 deg F, riding was continuous with a few leisurely stops.  Mode was GT for 50% of time and fast for the rest.  Terrain was NYC Manhattan streets from Soho to Harlem up east FDR, bridge over to Randall Ward Island, back via Central Park and down west side.  Lots of torque acceleration and actually up a few hills I could find <g>.  Hit max speed and cruised, but also alot of stop/start traffic lights acceleration at max.

Results were 21.9 miles over 2 hours 34 minutes until remote registered battery drain and died.  (try not to do this much as not good for your board Li battery BTW but I did just to see how the deck retired <g>.  Recharged earlier today took 6 hours and change (was not watching it closely) using the standard charger (I have not tried my fast charger, still want to research the impact on battery of fast charge)

All-in-all super satisfied as did everything I wanted to do, no holding back, and pretty much circled a majority of Manhattan Island.  So what more could I ask of this awesome deck at least for my purposes!  (I have gone from furthest tip south BPC to furthest tip north earlier this week).  In my estimation, 22 miles at my pace will clearly equate to over 31 miles on ECO if need be.

32T, still have not gotten to using the 38T or the kegel tangs or AT either...too busy banging up my deck!

Though I did match my pink 97mm clones with replacement pink noseguard screws <g>

So those 97mm pink clones fit I see, got a link to those wheels? @caustin So far, those who purchased black 97mm flywheel clones, including myself, found that the spokes are too thick. The purple ones fit.

One of the grub screws on the rear end of the motor fell off on my GT. There are 4 per motor. Does anyone know where I can get one?

Sure, one shop on ebay sold me thick spokes (black) and another sold me thin spokes (non-black).  The thin/standard abec spokes vendor is ebay luckystore930:
They have white, pink, purple, and lime in stock but out of black :confounded:
http://www.ebay.com/itm/Blank-Pro-97mm-Multiple-Color-Longboard-Flywheels-ABEC-7-Bearing-Spacers-/151887095681

BTW, on spokes did you have any tips or pictures on how you shaved down the evolve abec wheel pulley spokes to fit the thick clone spokes?  I want to try that when my spare wheel pulleys show up!

this might sound counterintuitive, but removing the cover can help prevent these problems. Belt covers are basically useless. Especially if you ride on paths with lots of small pebbles, which tends to happen more with AT wheels.

stuff goes in & can't come out.

I don't have any trouble at 40kmh. Can ride on grass at 35 kmh on 7in.

Not that hard to install tight rubbers and tighten them. Then you can carve as fast as you want. Also get that feedback. I love these trucks.

Have to agree with @darkydawson I tightened the bushings and have had no stability problems at all. I have since loosened them a little though so the board carves great (which coincidentally is also a technique to prevent speed wobbles). @onloop have you ridden the board yet?

## ATTENTION EVOLVE GT THREAD READERS & CONTRIBUTORS


THIS THREAD IS A MESS!...

I spent the last hour reading through everything and the topics are way too varied for one thread.

here is my idea.

1. Create dedicated category just for Evolve GT (already done)
2. Create separate new threads inside new "Evolve GT" category that only have thread-specific information. It will make it much easier to find info.
3. Threads i will create are. a) Wheel Sizes & Setups b) Problems & Solutions c) Evolve GT Videos d) Evolve Mods e) Evolve GT VS DIY f) any topic the community wants to create.
4. I will assign a new dedicated moderator to this sub-category, maybe @Mr_Mahal would be happy to accept this role? 
5. Forum moderators should begin working to filtering this big thread and removing good info and put it into the new smaller thread sections.


WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK?

Thanks @onloop, appreciated. Agree, I can't see the gain with a partial cover that opens forward. It just allows an intake/channel for debris.  Maybe it's there to protect the motor gear (or small fingers), because a rear mount set-up exposes them more than a forward design?

I just went for a 25km ish skate around the foreshore in newcastle where i live. Lovely day, about a million people everywhere. Handles like a dream. Brakes as smooth as.

My friend came along on a mountainbike.

Was on 97mm abecs. Even managed to ride on form grass more than once.

Would be awesome for a personal trainer lol.

I was carving most of the way from 20kmh to 35kmh. No probs. Still using stock everything.

Truck handle perfect. Factory bushings tight.
Point and shoot. Surf is always up.

Best fun you can have with your clothes on!

Just wondering with all the glossy carbon on the gt would it get all scratched up when you stand on it and use it all the time? I had the bamboo street and never had that issue. And whats the flex like on the gt deck compared to the bamboo street? On my bamboo i used to get scratches all over the motor mount and and motor itself and wondering if that issue is still current with the gt? As i would hate to see a scratch on those outrunner motors. New to carbon boards but ive seen videos of people jumping and flexing their bamboo boards and if that was done on the gt would it crack or snap?

 I've done maybe 120-50 km so far, including wet/ muddy days where my shoes get dirt/ grit on them, and I just had a good look at the deck- no scuffs or scratching from my feet at all. But @Rob.Endless had significant scuffing very early on from memory. Not sure how the others are faring.  I've scratched the back of the motor mounts slightly- a shop assistant held my board and when I got back she was resting it on the ground on the motor end... But because these have an exposed motor design, and the backend is heavy than the front, there is a good chance the rear motor mounts and motors will get scuffed eventually, especially if you ever pick it up from the front. The flipside is, the board has excellent clearance (relatively speaking) underneath, because the motors aren't forward of the rear trucks (more prone to scuff on speed humps/ driveways). No flex in the board at all. It feels like a tank so no, I no, you couldn't crack or snap it, IMO. It is solid. Being Carbon fibre though, it's pretty unforgiving on sharp/ blunt impacts as a couple blokes have discovered already. Where wood will dent a little, carbon fibre will damage pretty bad, but can be repaired.  At the end of the day as good as these things look, they are built for riding and they will wear with use. Keen to hear if others are finding their boards scratching up or not.

I'll be interested to see how those belts go in terms of life and durability. No doubt they'll be ok, but IMO Gates makes some of the best belts in the world (subjective, I know). They drive motorbikes (Harleys) , superchargers and timing belts- important benchmarks for high mechanical stress environments. You have bought a very expensive skateboard, and are now going to shop on price for critical components? A belt failure under brakes or acceleration across traffic would be a bad day.  Having said that, I have no idea if the linked ones have a quality reputation or not.

If time is not an issue you can get these pretty cheap from china. In terms of quality the belts are designed for high torque applications and are made of the same materials as Gates belts. Most wear is caused by debris and scraping the belts, which will degrade a belt regardless of brand. For the price I'm sticking with China.

I don't disagree with your decision logic, especially re stick/ debris damage, but the argument that they are the same thing is like saying Kumho tyres are the same as Pirelli P-zeros. True, both made of rubber, and they both go on cars, but they ain't the same tyre. There is a reason why one goes on Maseratis and the other goes on Datto 120Ys.  Still, if you want to save $15, fill your boots.

I do understand their are certain industries where material quality and design will make a big difference. I'm not saying they are the same thing, but in this case though I've used these belts for various high load machinery and quality has never been an issue. In terms of price, I just picked up 10 belts for $66 aud (5 street and 5 AT) delivered. 1 gates belt from evolve would be $25 plus shipping. Saving $20 a belt is one thing, having a few spares on hand and not having to wait a few days for shipping is the big bonus.

No thanks lol....no interest in that right now I want to ride the board I paid for. The epoxy just came in and I'll be filming the process once I get back from the gym. Also Evolve USA and Evolve HQ basically just said a replacement is on a way to Evolve USA so no worries if it fails. I got another BB d+ for $700 in the mean time so I can still do basic commuting either way.

Repair on my deck is about 80% done so far...just letting the JB weld cure atm...holding up nicely, recorded it all. One weak spot left and I should be ready to get sanding and then laying down some fresh fiber tomorrow. 

Now I kinda see why guys like building boards so much...when you spend time with something like this trying to improve it, a special bond forms (pun intended). It's like giving birth to something new, or in this case restoring something to its original condition. Truly powerful shit. Lets hope by morning it's all good :p

Also it's the "UART" connector on the chip if you take off the battery cover.
It'll force the board into slow mode and stay that way if it shakes loose. In my case, tightening that spot didn't work and I just shipped out my GT today

UART is the receiver/transmitter so I doubt it has much to do with the battery error. Evolve probably thought it was a loose connection which made the remote give a false positive.

Whew, long week... I really need to make a video or something.. I'm sitting on so much footage : p 

Long story short, my deck snapped back after the first time I thought the epoxy was holding. The main reasons for this I think are : 

1) I was not letting the epoxy cure its full time before testing (I usually let it cure about 50% or so then do slight testing)
2) I could not get the epoxy deep within the board due to not being able to use a syringe (because of the thickness) and 6 minute time frame that made it difficult to get it in every crack in one go.
3) I only tested the resistance of the deck with the trucks off the front. The pressure is distributed differently with them off as opposed to being pinned up on something.

So I got another strong epoxy that has a longer working time before setting and comes in a syringe (so no need to mix). Gonna test this out tonight and see the results tomorrow morning. Still worried about how safe it would be to ride this because of the potential sharp jarring vibrations coming from the road that could crack the epoxy. Will hope for the best..lol

Yeah they are currently getting a new one shipped out to Cali. But because the GT is still so new and they're still trying to get them out the door it might take a while. This is so I can at least cruise around on the smooth bike paths I have for long distances.. Probably nothing road related.

Got a d+ for $700 for my basic commuting which was money well spent...it may be a slow short ride but it's way better than no ride lol

Ebay fees cut me back a bit but yeah I basically sold for 1k. This one is in pretty good condition, about 500 miles on it, just discovered there's a slightly loose motor mount that I can probably fix myself. It's not hitting the ground but it might take a hit and get completely loose at some point..

Not interested in selling this thing again, even though I could make another $300 lol It has no issues, it just works and is predictable..I need that for basic commuting. I liked my GT for having fun though.

Starting to consider selling to get a Bamboo GT once I get this deck replaced...I thought I could handle a stiff deck but tbh I really did miss the flex of the boosted..I think the Bamboo GT would solve all the gripes I have with the carbon

Also, if that car tried to run over my bamboo GT like it did with my carbon it would fail I think :p The drop down deck of the carbon and super carve trucks makes it super easy to snap under a lot of pressure. Don't think it would've snapped like it did if it wasn't a drop down and had a RKP truck.

Bamboo GT is looking like a really attractive alternative the more I think about it. Might start looking for a buyer soon..

My original theory is that the ESC is just super efficient. I haven't confirmed max range with street wheels and I'm now using the 97's so I might not be the best person to test, especially in the hilly area of San Francisco. I can say, however, that I'm getting at least 20 miles of range (theoretically). Though the furthest I've rode is about 14 miles ending at about 50% on 83's. They state in their manual that the battery drops very fast after 40%.

Felt great while it lasted though lol

Damn man thanks for sharing. Sucks about the board but happy that you didn't get hurt, it could have been a lot worse. Maybe it's the New Yorker in me but I ride as if everyone is trying to hit me or cut me off ie: ultra defensive which is a little intense but it works for me. Now that I'm in Michigan I encounter a lot of drivers who are simply unaware which is a lot more dangerous than driving defensively in my opinion. It's why I actually feel safer driving in Manhattan than anywhere else. Stay safe out there!

That's a sad lost right there :frowning: 
Glad you did not get hurt. 

As an advice to everyone. 
I think more of us have to learn to ride GOOFY, it can save us from accidents, the reason is that because we need to ride on the direction of the traffic to the right side of the road, riding on a REGULAR stance will leave us with our backs to the passing cars  and this is just too dangerous. 

The driver are not to be trusted ever, they may want to see on what we are rinding  and not noticing that they are too close and we can not see them because our stance. 

This was the first thing I had to deal after ridding my board on the streets in the BX.
 ( 1 Week of GOOFY training :slight_smile: )  

Safe ridding guys.

@Dedbny that was quite some time ago I believe...where are you hearing this? The only two people that had issues like that had bad remotes. They bench tested and where able to replicate the problems, this was not too long after they got to board so manufacturing issue. They got new remotes

On Jay Bostons recent vlogg with GT comparo. Yes updated issue.  Remote replaced.  However are there any new long term comnents by them with the new remotes.  There must be some still out there with these issues.

I don't think we will find any systemic design flaws. Manufacturing defects, sure it'll happen no doubt, everything has a failure rate. Why? Because the end consumer wasn't/ isn't the test bed. These boards had months of beta testing which will (most likely) uncover critical design flaws. This is one of the unspoken benefits of the larger outfits. Sure, you pay more for what you get, but you are getting a product with many hours of testing under its belt, because they have the capital to invest in it (as opposed to having to sell the first batch to fund the second batch etc, and I'm not knocking the innovators who do that- those entrepreneurs ultimately drive everything forward). Plus, this company is one or so generations into its learning cycle. The faults in the previous evolves  will ultimately contribute to better GTs, makes business sense to reduce return rates and warranty claims. 

What we will most likely see pop up are manufacturing failures. Of course, I could be wrong.

Hi guys, I have the Carbon GT off road and street version, I'll write a short review when I have some time, however a quick question and I'm not a skateboarder.

How do you clean this thing?  Specifically the large area flat top where you stand with the grit grip tape etc?  You can't really wipe it with a damp cloth or anything because it is so grippy / sticky that any cloth gets caught on it and pulls fibers from the cloth that get stuck on this, and make it look even worse!!  I can't hose the top of the board off because of the seal, so wondering what you guys do to clean that large grit top area where things stick to, 

thanks,
Matt

I wouldn't bother, it's always going to get dirty because you're constantly stepping on it. Most dirt just comes off naturally anyway. If you really want to clean it, it's very easy to unscrew that part with the included allen wrenches and hose off if needed.

Search for "grip gum". Most skate shops have it, or you can find it easily online. That combined with a brass brush to dig into the grip will keep it in decent condition. It will get dirty no matter what, but that doesn't mean that you have to let it build up. Fortunately, it is easy to replace the grip if it goes to shit.

That's a 3mm pitch which won't work with the default 15T motor pulley on the GT if that's what you're asking. You should start your own build thread and ask questions there since we're getting a bit off topic.

These 8" Knobby tires fit on stock evolve AT wheels (the MBS wheels do not work, larger bearings etc) and stock 7" evolve inner tubes https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/collections/wheels/products/7-inner-tube.  Everything works fine, but have to take off AT belt covers to use 8" knobby wheels.  Definitely worth trying, and get going fast.

Is it true that it takes at least an hour to change from street to AT wheel set up. A tad misleading from Evolve adv. id expect 15min reasonable time to change all wheels, but am I too unrealistic.

Did you ever manage to fix this? I've had my GT only three days and the blue on-off toggle switch no longer lights up. Charger still "red" but board body not heating up as if it isn't charging.  

It did stop on its own after 4kms of riding yesterday. I assumed it had overheated but maybe a loose connection or bad solder?

Hopefully so. On another note, I really hope the deck chipping/snapping issue you had with your old GT deck isn't destined to happen to everyone :/ Someone else just had their deck crack on one side randomly...the durability of the CF is looking pretty bad since I've seen other degradation of the GT decks such as paint chipping off and whatnot

Yea, I'm not sure what's up with that. I got the deck replaced before I sold it so it was brand new, but now the new owner says one of the screw holes for the lid is stripped so he's sending it back to Evolve yet again. @kaly mentioned that the cracking may be due to how they're laying the CF, in a way where it creates a seam right where my crack formed.

It's unfortunate, not sure if they even bother to look at how these decks are snapping and are changing the techniques at all...my board was one of the first new decks (has 8 screws), so not sure how different it is. 

As for the stripped screw holes he could've fixed it himself with some tap and die. The holes aren't too small. I had similar issues on my BB when I was trying to mod it and had to open it up a bunch. Usually happens when using power tools or being impatient lol

$30 fast charger. from 0% to 100% in 120 minutes

I just tested a chinese fast charger on my Evolve GT. Had it delivered in 2 weeks to Canada
My board was completely drained to 0% when I tested .

after 60 minites remote showed 64% 
after 100 minutes remote showed 90%
after 120 minutes the charger showed a green light and the board was at 100%

I'm bad at math and want to get my head around this.

I did a ride, but forgot to change the wheel settings. I left them on the street wheels 83mm, while I actually had the 7inch AT wheels on. The remote read approx 20 kms. Approximately what would this equate to in terms of actual distance? More or less?

I had already ordered aftermarket pulleys of different sizes along with 3 other belts of different sizes. I was impatient so I bought various sizes in hopes that a particular combination will work. To add to it, i was even more impatient so I ordered two whole new motors with the stock pulley already on it so that I have less down time. Here are the results. I tried running a bigger motor pulley with 97mm flywheel clones and torque decreased of course but top speed was pretty insane compared to stock. Slapped the kegels on there and torque is about the same with a bit higher top speed vs the 97 mm clones.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/1/3191ab006dd93a77f0efc66aa03ead8408984691.JPG" width="669" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/c/fcf98a8a4e22289b99f5cd129f36efcc575d526e.JPG" width="669" height="499">

@caustin sorry for the late reply, I purchased a pair of these, in 8mm bore of course:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/HTD-5M-15T-16W-5-6-6-35-8-10mm-Bore-Pitch-5mm-Timing-Belt-Drive-Pulley-15-Tooth-/252402866384

And these as well: http://www.ebay.com/itm/HTD-5M-20T-16W-5-6-6-35-8-10-12-12-7-14-15-17-Bore-Pitch-5mm-Timing-Belt-Pulley-/252402877902

The grub screws that come with these pulleys are too short and they suck, be sure to buy longer M5 grub screws with a flat point, I believe I am using  8mm long grub screws. I just purchased a grub screw set: https://www.amazon.com/Raogoodcx®-250pcs-Socket-Assortment-Plastic/dp/B01G30ZN3E/ref=sr_1_9?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1477008133&sr=1-9

I believe the stock street belts are HTD 250-5M-15. I was impatient so I purchased a bunch of belts so that a pair was bound to fit, I now have 4 HTD 250-5M-15, a pair of HTD 255-5M-15, HTD 260-5M-15, HTD 265-5M-15 and HTD 270-5M-15. Don't waste money like an idiot like myself, just one size up fits (HTD 255-5M-15) with the 32T Evolve drive gears and 20T pinion.

Also, with the 97mm flywheels, you will obviously lose a crapload of torque but damn, you can hit about 30mph I'm guessing(15T pulley vs 20T pulley, quite a huge jump. It was too torqueless tho and I didnt want to stress the motors and who knows what else haha. I now run 20T+32T 80mm orange Kegels, good amount of torque still with a top speed around the same as the 97mm (I haven't measured the speed but it feels a bit faster than stock gearing with the 97s) I also live in an area with no steep hills, the board and motors are not any hotter than stock (I weigh around 160lbs)

Thanks for the response, super helpful with the links. One of the eBay links took me to a page letting me know I already bought one and do I want another lol. We have been shopping similarly. That said I am going to get one of those grub screw sets you linked!

Good advice and observations on the pulley/wheel combinations impact in speed/torque trade offs. I am 190 lbs and using the 38T evolve wheel pulley for torque so will probably end up with a different combo than you!

@caustin I should take a video of the GT hitting 30mph. I still experience absolutely zero speed wobbles with the double king ping trucks. Perhaps because these trucks are wide as hell. I keep both front and rear trucks really loose, too. Don't get me wrong, even with the 97's on and 20T motor pulleys (vs stock 15T, quite a huge jump), it still packs a punch. Uphills is where you really notice it, flat roads is not bad at all.

Evolve of course will rip you off on parts. Each motor(with pulley already installed) were $189 each, and yes I got ripped off, all because I couldnt wait a few more weeks to be boardless...and so I bought a pair from Evolve so that I can be back on my board within a few days (the aftermarket replacement pulleys from ebay took about a few weeks to arrive versus Evolve parts only taking a few days to arrive)

8mm bore, I tried looking for a steel pulley but could not find one. I contacted Evolve and they said it is impossible for the pulley to wear out (a bunch of BS) because they say it is the hardest part of the drive train, the belt being rubber and the wheel pulleys being plastic.

Thanks Rob, if I find a steel pulley I'll post.  Yes, I too contacted Evolve on the pulley before buying my GT.  MetroBoard changed out their drive pulley to be steel and the wheel pulley to be aluminum, they have a plastic wheel pulley too.  But the understand that the hard-core users/riders are mushrooming the aluminum small pulley and changed that out to make the board better.   When I got my GT I fell over backwards to find my small motor pulley was plastic!  Not aluminum and of course not steel.  The 2nd day of owning my board a damn pebble got wedged into the small motor gear and really put some beating on my belt.  That's why belts break.  I pulled the pebble out but the damage / stress has been done to the belt.  Still have to inspect the plastic gear but most likely that has damage, why, because its plastic.  I'm just thinking that Evolve at the moment does not have enough experience / customer data yet to change their design.  Running a belt setup and plastic gears on the AT setup is just asking for wear.  Its not even sealed.   But this board is amazing so I have to tip my hat at that.

[/quote]

Just an update to this, as my drive pulley wore out as well and I needed to get a replacement. I'm just posting here as this was the only forum I found discussing a worn pulley...

I contacted Evolve (Australia), and they now have replacements available. You need to email them proof of purchase and a photo of the gears and they will sort you out with replacements. 

I was a bit concerned when I first read this thread, but the guys at Evolve sorted it all out very quickly. Just thought I'd add to the discussion for the next person that needs it...

EVOLVE SKATEBOARDS ARE LEMONS!!

READ THE FOLLOWING CONSUMER AFFAIRS COMPLAINT AND DON'T SAY YOU WEREN'T WARNED!!!
***************************************************************
Case Assessment and Response Unit
Office of Fair Trading
GPO Box 3111
BRISBANE, QLD, 4001 

Re: Consumer complaint against Evolve Skateboards

Dear Sir/Madam,
I wish to lodge a complaint against electric-skateboard manufacturer Evolve Skateboards based at Varsity Lakes on the Gold Coast. I have had the worst consumer experience I could have ever imagined possible with Evolve Skateboards, and the matter remains unresolved. 
I purchased Evolve’s latest model carbon-fibre electric-skateboard back in early June 2016 at a cost of $2,159. For that price, I never expected the nightmare that followed. There was a six-week waiting period for delivery at the time as these were Evolve’s latest and greatest design of electric-skateboard, and therefore I didn’t receive the board until the last week of July. 
It was only a little over a month at the end of August, I was making the first complaint of electrical issues to Evolve, raising some serious safety concerns. The board would either turn off unexpectedly mid-ride, resulting in the board having no brakes to slow-down or stop; or switch to its slowest speed without warning leaving you with less power than expected upon going to cross an intersection leaving you vulnerable to collisions. 
To solve the issue, on the 5th September Evolve sent me a replacement “motor-controller” which is the main processing circuit-board between the battery, hand-remote and the power to the motors. This did appear to resolve the issues for a short while, but it wasn’t before long I was experiencing the same issues. In fact, I was making my second complaint to Evolve by mid-January. I was starting to feel frustrated with the board by this time as it was proving itself to be more trouble than it was worth. 
Evolve requested I send the board to them as this was the second instance of electrical issues; so I did (at my cost). The motor-controller was then replaced for the second time. I didn’t receive the board back until late February, as Evolve returned it to the address where I lived at the time I initially purchased the board, even though I had explicitly notified them of my new address to avoid such occurring. They were then asking me to pay for the additional return postage costs, even though it was their mistake.  
Despite the frustrations with the postage, I was pleased upon receiving the board back as I was hopeful that after it had made the trip to Evolve, that it would be finally repaired and I could start enjoying the thing finally. Unfortunately, this was not the case and it was soon the same old story. The board seemingly had a will of its own; some days it would turn on; others it wouldn’t; or quite often it would wait until you were a few kilometres from home before it completely died; leaving you with no choice but to lug it back home.  
I was seriously upset by this stage; the board was still not repaired and it was so unreliable I didn't even feel comfortable riding it further than 500m due to the fear of being stranded. I was tired with speaking to various people within Evolve about it, and wanted someone to take ownership of the problem and make this whole situation right for me. I knew the owner Jeff, was actively involved in the daily operations of the business, so I called and requested to speak to him, only to get the response; “Jeff doesn’t concern himself with customer complaints”. I raised my concern to the person I was speaking too, of the costs involved with continually shipping it interstate for repairs, only to get told that sending it back at my cost was their policy and the only way forward in getting the board repaired was to do just that.  
So I did – again. Before I posted it back however, I took great time and effort in monitoring and documenting via video the problems I was experiencing. I was hoping this would assist Evolve as I understood the problems were intermittent; they were not always present making it not the easiest to diagnose. 
The collated video, along with an email detailing the issues were sent to Evolve in Queensland, and so was the board a short time later. I specifically told Evolve that the 'symptoms' of malfunction often don't begin appearing after 5 to 15min of riding, and I requested they keep the board for however long it was needed for it to be repaired.  Well it wasn’t more than a week later I received a notification the board was on its way back after having its motor-controller replaced (again). Although once again, Evolve had actually sent the board back to my old address in Sydney and I had to wait for it to be returned to Evolve and re-dispatched. 
Before I had even physically received the board back, I expressed my concerns to Evolve at having heard that just the motor-controller had been replaced again. As this had been done 3 times now and the problems had just kept arising after a short while. I expressed my concern that it may be a battery or motor irregularity causing the motor-controller to malfunction, hence it needing to be replaced continually. 
After pulling it out of the box upon receiving it back, I only got roughly 500 meters down the road  before the board started turning itself off again mid-ride. I turned it on again only to get another 10 meters and it was off again. Well I was furious – absolutely livid. I was ready to throw the stupid thing off the rail bridge I was on I was so angry. How could it possibly be returned in this state? Do they really now expect me to ship it straight back to them at my cost? I was even more pissed-off when Evolve told me that they hadn’t bothered viewing the videos I made for them to assist diagnosing, as the file was “too large” (2gb) for them to download.
I knew too well by this time what needed to happen. The issues were well documented to have commenced a little over a month after I first received the board and Evolve had since attempted to repair it on 3 occasions without success. The board had failed to meet any basic and reasonable expectations in quality, reliability, safety and value. It's for these reasons I have never questioned whether I would be eligible for a refund if I deemed it necessary.   
Before any demand was made however, the slim possibility had to be ruled out that it wasn't the hand-remote causing any of the issues. Each time the board had been returned to Evolve, they must have had to use their own hand-controller, as the one that came with the board had stayed with me. To prove it was indeed the board that had the malfunction, I purchased from Evolve a brand new hand-remote at a cost of $120. Well after receiving the new hand-remote and experiencing exactly the same issues, it was confirmed that after 3 attempts, Evolve had indeed failed to repair the board to a usable, reliable state, and I simply needed to demand my money back. 
I sent the board back with a demand letter requesting to be refunded for the initial cost of the board, and took the opportunity to express my dissatisfaction. I also explicitly told them not to send the board back to me.
The only emails I received back thereafter, were emails that were attempting to suggest the board had been ill-treated in someway. For instance, I had replaced the brand new belts I had recently paid extra for with worn ones before returning, which they were ever so quick to criticise. That there was dust or dirt they thought had got in somewhere that shouldn't. The thing that infuriated me the most however, is their claim the boards carbon-fibre deck itself has been damaged at the rear somehow and it needs replacing at a cost of $550! I was given notice of this in an email several weeks after it had been in their possession and after several emails that made no mention of it; which makes me think if there is such damage, it's of their doing. I can swear on my own life there was no such damage when the board left my end last and I refuse to accept any different. Weirdly enough though, it didn't stop Evolve trying to return the board to me. Yes that's correct; after explicitly instructing them not to send it back; and demanding to be compensated; and after their email saying the carbon-fibre board had itself been damaged and needs replacing; they attempt to send it back! They sent me an email stating that some electrical component had been replaced again and further testing had been done (someone riding my apparently broken board around) with no further reports of any issues. Well I'm sure I can be understood for not being so gracious. I refused to sign the postal consignment and I assume the board has now been returned to Evolve. 
It's evident Evolve are deliberately trying any tactic to weasel their way out of compensating me by trying to pin whatever issues the board has on me, framing it in a way that I had somehow misused the board in some way. This is complete nonsense. Submitted with this complaint is the collated email correspondence between myself and Evolve from the first instance of malfunction to the present. This clearly documents this being an ongoing saga of electrical issues from little more than a month after I first received the board. The electrical issues being experienced rendered the board unsafe, unreliable and generally unusable as an electric-skateboard is inherently useless without working electrics. It's astonishing to learn that after the woeful experience I have had with Evolve and their product; after 3 failed attempts to fix the issues; Evolve somehow think they are not responsible or obliged to give my money back. I never imagined I would experience the misery I have had from a product that was intended to be fun and cost over 2 thousand dollars. I experienced nothing but continual electrical issues that made the board unreliable, unsafe and generally unusable from almost the time I first received the board. 
I believe I have a strong case and wish to take it as far as it needs to go to receive a refund for the initial cost of the board. I request the services of Consumer Affairs (CA) to assist in this process. I will attach the original invoice along with this letter. The 2GB of video showing the issues as they were experienced is also available upon request but is is too large to attach along with this letter.
I regrettably was unable to attend to this matter sooner due to a hectic end to the year myself, and therefore fully expect this won't be a matter that CA will assess until the new year. I would appreciate to hear back from someone around then. Please don't hesitate to contact me via the details provided if you may have any further questions that may assist in the matter.
Yours sincerely,

@uglyduck get yourself acquainted with the Australian consumer guarantee.

You are fully entitled to a refund AND the return shipping costs AND compensation for any losses resulting from the failure. 

If you need any advice please pm me, the Australian consumer law is much more simple to understand than the TPA 1974. It is heavily weighted to the consumer, I would take as a next step to quote your rights and evolves obligations under the law before lodging with the ACCC. 

Good luck

What is your location? There are many better options out there than Evolve. Stick around here for a while and read up. You will quickly see my point. Good luck.

LoL that's the point - it should be instinct to hold the camera the correct way.  You shouldn't need to concentrate on it.  Just remember your eyes are horizontal.

Evolve wants me to send it through the mail for examination but the Post Office won't ship it in it's current state.
I have not opened it or done anything with it, I am super busy right now.
