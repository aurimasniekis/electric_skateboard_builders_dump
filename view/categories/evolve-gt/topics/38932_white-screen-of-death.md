Today, in the middle of the busy three-lane street my remote control screen went white and everything stopped working...

After coming back on foot for 10km I managed to take it apart and reset power...

oh LOL i didn't see the tag. I'm a doof. 

Has anything like this happened before? What were the circumstances leading up to it? I'm super curious about anything related to evolve failing in any way whatsoever.
