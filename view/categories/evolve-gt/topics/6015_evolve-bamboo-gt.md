Please use this thread for all discussion regarding the Bamboo GT. It was just announced earlier today with full specs on FB. It's going on pre-order in two days for AUS, and on Monday for the US. Price is ~$1450, range ~ 20+ miles on a charge (in eco), same weight roughly as carbon and same power/speed. Wheel base is smaller as well.

There is no way the bamboo weighs about the same. The carbon deck weighs 1 LB or less and the bamboo deck plus the the battery enclosure probably weight about 4-5 lbs.   Thats about a 20- 25% increase in total weight.  That is quite significant, proportionately speaking.

The Bamboo GT battery enclosure alone probably weighs about the same as the carbon deck.

Maybe it's the same weight given the smaller deck and 6.5ah battery vs 10ah.

@Mr_Mahal If evolve gave you the option to get the bamboo instead, would you? I'm guessing not. 

Did you ever get the chance to test out max range on gt Carbon? 

I think CF is sexy as hell, but the material makes me nervous. I wouldn't want to chip or scratch it. I also kinda like a little flex.

Knowing the specs now, nope. I want as much range as possible. I do still intend on getting it in the future because the trucks with a bamboo deck at low speeds sounds like a match made in heaven.

Not in eco really. My last ride was going to be the first really good test but then ya know...it goes forever though rest assured. I have a lot of hills, and one time after a long ride I was blasting uphill full throttle and the battery died on me. Wasn't really paying attention to the % and didn't think about how much it'd drain going uphill. So definitely be careful.

I almost put a clear bra film on the deck but I stopped because I just wanted to ride the damn thing...lol you will find that it is inevitable to get little scratches, but you can buff most out anyway. When I get my replacement deck I will be taping it up. Putting on a nose guard and grip tape around the top of the deck where your feet go will also help a lot.

The Bamboo board DOES weigh the same. It has been stated very clearly. Why would they lie about it? Yes carbon fibre weighs less than bamboo, but the Carbon GT is a longer board and has a larger battery, so that offsets the weight savings of the carbon fibre.

What i do love  about  the  bamboo gt is that you ar not lock into one deck !! It is very easy to transfer all the components into another deck Like bustin or Another tipe of material besides the bamboo!  If you like !! And  35km range is not that bad at all !! Is more then enough for a ride around the block ,but if you commute all day long  and you don't have a car  then  the carbon gt is the one for you!!   But you guys are right the carbon fibre look more fragile and I'm worried in the future eventually it will crack .  What made me think like this, is after I saw what happened to Mr mahal!!!

Yeah. My wife thought my carbon GT was excellent so she is going to join me on a Bamboo GT. Being in Aus the pricing ($1400 AUD) is hard to beat for me compared to the offshore options (AUD to USD conversion comes into play).  The carbon GT has been used nearly daily since release and has been flawless (for me). Took about a month to be get my full (double truck) skate legs at any speed/ carve. Looking back I must have looked pretty unsteady. 

Eventually I'd love to be able to afford a smaller/ lighter board with certified for air battery to support work/ holiday travel. Keeping an eye on Inboard. Hard to justify, these things are bloody expensive, but it's hard to go back to walking or pushing.

I thought hard about it. Screw preordering. I want it now. I really should just sink 2k into an all out ballsy mountain board build. 

The vesc state of affairs makes me hesitate with that plan.

I was thinking of going DIY but with the bamboo GT I must say it thicks all my boxes: dual motor, 35km range ( enough no?) and a nice flex board ideal for carving. It probably will be unsteady on high speeds ( see comparison video carbon GT VS bamboo 2gen youtube) but yes ride on eco or max on sport. 

Only thing I'm a little concerned about is the los of connection with the remote. Anybody know if this is a big issue with the GT or just rare cases?

```
Can only speak for myself. Never had a lost connection while moving. 

My location is a small city/ suburbs- so relatively low radio spectrum intererance in comparison to a mega-city. 

I've had two occasions when it hasn't paired when I've turn the board and remote on. In perspective, that would be less than 1% of the time, and was fixed by restarting the board.  

If I did a risk assessment on the GT remote connection based on my experience, I would assess it to have a low probability of failure. I've seen nothing to suggest it is a broad issue.

It will be a good board but the flex isn't as flexy as the boosted board.  But should be better than carbon.  

My personal dislike about the evolves are their double kingpin trucks.  Besides that they seem to hit the check marks.

## \#23 Posted by: magnetvox Posted at: 2016-07-27T02:17:11.792Z Reads: 268

```
Now that they are releasing the bamboo, I feel like they could have differentiated the two boards better by focusing on the carving on the bamboo Gt, and performance on the carbon Gt. Put the double king pins on the bamboo Gt for flexy surf-like carve, more stable trucks (and larger motors) on the carbon Gt for speed and off-road. Then they probably would have captured a wider market, and appealed more to the performance dudes.

I think the Boosted Dual plus 2.0 is a good riders board for feel and comfort due to the loaded deck, and can go on planes. Not cheap though. Did you consider that for your partner as well. Would be lighter than a Bamboo GT as well I would have thought.

Yeah, all good points mate. Considered it but it came down to cost and range (and a little to do with Australian vs US for any warranty issues). I imagine the boosted 2.0 is lighter too. $1400 aud and 25km+ for the bamboo swung it in their favor. The air travel is actually important to us, but we would use them less that way than long rides at home.

Hi guys,
Been lurking for a few weeks, but finally signed up. I've got a Bamboo GT on order and it looks like they've arrived at Evolve HQ. Anyone else ordered one?
I'm getting pretty excited, this'll be my first e-board

I don't have any videos yet, but I've had mine for about a week and I love it. The thing just carves! It's my first electric board, so I can't really compare it to any others, but I'm in love with the way it handles. It feels like a snowboard when you get it moving side to side, so nice, puts a big grin on your face. I haven't been on an specific long range rides yet, mainly just carving around my neighbourhood, so can't comment on range yet. But so far it's a big thumbs up from me

I was going to get one of these because of the supposedly 50km range that it has but after electric wave's video on YouTube stating that it overheats only after 10min of riding is a real bummer. He mentions it 6:02 into the video as one major con. The Boosted board 2 looks great and with a 12.2 mile range or 19.5km is not too shabby.

1 you wont get 12m out of boosted ,since they dont ship this battery you get it with the 7 mile range battery ,
as a boosted owner i tell you the 7 is really a 4.5 ,and the 4.5 is really a 2.5 when you go uphill in pro .
the overheat he was talking about is true but did you look how this guy ride , he is crazy good and going sliding like its a snowboard ,1 you wont have those issue if you dont ride like him on grass and off road ,and for sure you wont have this problem if you get boosted since it CANNOT do this , if you all about range boosted isnt for you , bigger battery is not here its a hoax ,not in prod yet ,buy now get it with old battery ,and 4 months from now you get the bigger one ,EVOLVE is the only game to play here ,loved the boosted for 2 weeks now i need something better

I wouldn't say many users.  I've been constantly following any news and reviews about the bamboo and carbon gt.  Still very few reviews.  Your quote was from one disgruntled user who had a bad experience, and was referring to the carbon gt, not bamboo.  
I have seen a YouTube video of a user showing he had a motor issue (bamboo), which should be clearly covered by warranty.  He also reported poor wheels balance on AT, but that's all I've really found.

I would wait and see.

You really should have stopped reading after "it's going to catch fire." They obviously had a bad experience, but they keep making statements like that as if they are fact, when they are not. I'm still trying to find "soda can butter metal" on the periodic table too 😂 Anyway, wait for your board to arrive and come to your own conclusions, I've had my bamboo GT for the last week and ridden it over an hour every day with no issues at all. Any product will have people that love it and people that hate it, just don't get swayed by the over the top emotional statements and make your own conclusions.

Don't be too sure about that.  Jeff definitely reads up on forums and I wouldn't be surprised if he is reading everything in here, he just doesn't reply or participate.  He replied on reddit a couple a days ago when I posted a comment about a hill climb comparison video that was posted (to which boosted replied, and then Jeff participated in that convo since Sanjay from boosted was trying to say evolve video may be biased).

If they are using a smaller battery with a smaller max current draw, then the voltage sag might increase compared to the Carbon.

This is why I like A123 LiFePO4 cells. They can release up to 70A each... 

Also, limiting the acceleration on the GT would probably help with the volt sag.

The Carbon GT is awesome when it works, but there definitely seems to be some critical flaws that need to be addressed. My CGT is currently back at Evolve for the 2nd time after being "fixed" the first time. Even after being fixed my board would randomly shut down even when riding on flats and going slow. I wish it was while riding off road or when really pushing it up hills etc because I would then be able to anticipate when it would shut down. There were times when it seemed to work perfect and could go up and down hills etc. However then other times when I rode a less than a mile on completely flat road and the board shutdown on me randomly without warning. 2 of my friends order CGT at the same time and we have all experienced these issues at one time or another, but mine seems to be the worst of the 3. 

In summary:
I love my Carbon GT and want nothing more for it to work. 
The guys at Evolve USA have been great and appreciate their help, but I feel like their hands are tied without a solution and not able to admit the issue. 
Lastly, just be careful while riding and getting to know your board at first. Your board may not have these issues but there are enough examples of this happening that you might. So just be careful when riding especially in urban environments such as where I live. I have sustained some significant injuries due to the board shutting down randomly and fortunate that I wasn't hurt worse. 
Be careful and hope that Evolve addresses the issue.

I have been following this site for about a month and finally thought I would post now I have something to post about. I got my evolve Bamboo GT about 6 days ago and have noticed there isn't a whole lot up about it, especially where range is concerned. after about 40-50km I’ve had no control issues or anything else I can really think of.

RANGE

I ride 10 - 12 km a day right now, trying to get a feel for the board. I only have the AT setup and ride in a beachy type area in North Queensland, Australia that is generally flat with one or two big hills.

I wanted to do a range test so decided to ride the thing flat. The first afternoon I rode 2.5km to the shops and back to grab a bite to eat, then later that night I went for a 6km burn around the streets. This was all on paved roads mostly on the ECO setting. I got home and didn't charge the board.

The next night I went for another late burn around the streets. about 50% of the time was spent in FAST and of that time about 15-20% of the 40 minute ride was spent going up decent inclines in FAST mode at about 75% throttle. Generally during this ride I sat at about 50% throttle on FAST as I still haven’t quite found my feet and don’t have any protective gear. At about 10% battery I started to head home in ECO and got home at 6%. When I walked into the house and switched off the board the battery was reading 22% so as you can see make sure you account for battery lag when estimating range. The ride was 11km

So 19.5km with AT setup on pavement with a combination of FAST and GT on one charge. Not bad for someone who weighs 90kg. 

HANDLING

Tighten the trucks as soon as you can. Like before you even go for your first ride. They are way too soft when it arrives and you will kill yourself if going over 15km per hour. 

LIGHTS

If you are from Australia go and get youself a set of the Fluid USB rechargeable light set. I got front and back for $50 so saved a heap on the ones they sell on the evolve store. They are a must if you are riding at night.

 https://www.anacondastores.com/cycling/bike-accessories/bike-lights/fluid-luminite-usb-light-set/p/BP90074234

Hope this post helps those trying to make a decision about getting one.

Hey guys,

I noticed an issue with the Evolve Bamboo remote, and I wanted to see if anyone else had this problem.

I went to turn on the remote, the screen went all white, and stayed like that.  I couldn't turn the remote off and had no signal to the board.  

In order to fix the problem, i had to unscrew the small screws on the remote and physically remove the cable from the chip board to the battery, and plug it back in.  There is no manual kill sequence on the remote (i.e. holding down power button for 5 seconds for manual shut off.)  

Has anyone else experienced this?

Others have said to drain the battery fully then charge it again should be fine.  I guess unplugging the battery would also do it.

Ordered a bamboo GT myself, does anyone know if the brakes switch off is a problem with the street setup? Im in the UK so its not likely to overheat, but there are usually smaller puddles and bumpy roads.

Hi crew,

I just ordered the bamboo gt 2in1 yesterday. Really wish I read this site first before buying but I still think I made the right decision. I wanted the bamboo over carbon board for the looks. I'd use it for play and to commute to work too. I live in a small country seaside town in Bunbury, WA in Australia. 

Once I get the board I'll video everything from first unbox, first ride, most rides, range/battery test, pros and cons plus any issues with the board I may have. Full review coming!! I just bought the gopro5 so I'll start recording with that!

I'm trying to get my other friends to get the board too but they want to see how I go first! Doing it for the team! If Evolve treat me good and if their product works this probably won't be my first board!

Really glad to have found this forum

I know the gt bamboo has some kind of sprayed on grip or something else but I'm wondering if you can still apply grip tape over it.  The board looks great but I still would like to do this.  I missed the pre-order on the cf gt...prob gonna get the bamboo.  Just wish it had the same range, the extra weight wouldn't be a big deal for me.

Hi jeff, let me know if you can apply griptape over and you do end up doing it. I do agree that the cf is great for the range/battery... i might get it too next time if i have no issues with the bamboo... but I still think I made the right decision for bamboo haha.. a lot of reviews report the cf having cracking issues with the material

Thanks bud...do u remember the title of the video or have a link..also anyone know if this board is able to ride in rain...I know it's not safe and all that but if I get stuck in the rain or hit a puddle it would be really bad if it got messed up...they are pretty vague and sort of contradicting on the site but I know they have to watch their ass and don't promote riding in wet conditions..any opinions or experience I'm in New Jersey and shit gets kinda nasty here this time of the year

The Bamboo is heavier than the Carbon. Or is that what you are saying?

I don't have either yet but the carbon deck is definitely lighter than the bamboo deck...but it also has a bigger battery, hence the longer range...I was just saying I wish the bamboo had the same size battery as the carbon, which would make it a little heavier.  I hear they are pretty much the same weight due to the heavier battery on the carbon and the heavier deck on the bamboo...if anyone is lucky enough to have  bought both maybe they will comment with first hand experience.  Take care

It should be possible to change the stock-battery to a custom one to get 50km with the Bamboo GT like some people did with the Gen2 Bamboo. Would make the board 200-300g heavier.

But for the costs, it would be better to build a DIY-Board instead to get the same result.

I am lucky enough to own both and I can confirm what you say. The CGT and the BGT weigh exactly the same. The CGT's bigger battery is offset by its lighter deck.

I have both but I need to send it back because they or both defect. I'm really disappointed....I payed 6000 usd to get 2 defect board. Once this said (made me feel better :p) I LOVE the bamboo, the flex of the board give a really nice ride very close to snowboarding IMO. I think I prefer the bamboo, if it had the same range I would've preferred 2 bamboo.

im unsure whether if i can accept it that we bought new we should have a new and working board... but their apparently out of stock so the fastest way to get our boards back is for them to repair them... u really do end up losing abit of consumer confidence in the brand with this many reported bugs... literally unboxed and defective on the first day. I can accept a arepair if we were a few weeks/months into riding the board.. but im placing my trust in them if i get back a fully operational and working board ill be happy but if it becomes defective again and needs to be sent back im gona ask for a new board.. or report to consumer protection. because i think its pretty bad customer care if you just get back a product that fails within a short time frame.

I asked the same question about getting a new board when mine had issues on the first day of riding. However that is not how their warranty policy works. For me is it is a minimum 2 weeks without my board even if they turn around and ship it back out the same day since I live on the east coast of the US. The first time I sent the board back it came back and the problem was worse than before. The second time I sent it back, it came back and has been functioning like a dream for the most part. I agree I would have rather have started with a fresh functioning board for the start, but customer service has been really good so I am happy. Good luck with yours

Got mine a week ago and I'm so in love with it, here's a picture of the new grip job I made today
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/2/726ffa2f612577dd1d436f8185c196ffee950cf6.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Range wise it's very good, I'm doing some regular 12+km rides in Paris (which has massive hills) and get to 50% battery I believe. You might want to get the fast charger if you intend to make some stops for big rides or charge at the destination. The speed and acceleration are amazing too, went only twice in GT mode because it's insane.

I put the AT tires on a few days ago and was totally amazed, I'd love to ride them all the time so much but the range is divided by 2 and I can't really afford that in Paris...

**I plan on adding a battery to the back of the board or even replace the stock one to get more range, but I don't know where to start or where to search. If you guys have any idea about how to do this let me know! :slight_smile:**

So I picked my bamboo GT up a few months ago, I live in  Fremantle Wa, super stoked to own one. Carves beautifully with the double truck rig ( this literally blew my mind OH THE SWEET SWEET CARVE!!) Gets me around my area pretty well, I was however a bit bummed at the range once I found out it could hit "up to 20kms" that sold me and I put my order in, Fremantle's a relatively flat area I ride generally in fast mode and at best will see 7 to 8kms,which actually goes really fast before I'm kicking my way home
Now I've been thinking of doing a trip around Rottnest island on this thing but I know I'll be kicking before I can blink 40km loop which started my thoughts of an interchangable battery setup or 2, I can throw in my back pack and when one dies half way 5min change out and I'm off again
I'm no electrical engineering wizard and don't know where to start.
I'm not too sure if 7 to 8kms in fast is good or not as someone else above me said there's not really anyone out there saying much on the whole range thing, and I'm not sure if my expectations were a bit too high
But let me know what you guys think about the interchangeable battery setup would be a good idea<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/c/0cbd6e0459a862b4377c07295eaa0225ce130331.jpg" width="666" height="500"> This is what the inside of the board looks like anyways.

well i could not find them here only on an american website 
which were so expensive you'd have thought they were made of gold 
sorry i just do not think they are worth that sort of money ,just no way get real 
in fact i think it's sick to charge that much for them 
plus shipping on top to UK 
plus tax and customs duty approx 45 quid
which on electric skate boards are always astronomical more than 48 quid
so until i find them here ,and cheaper 
but soon as i do i will have one ,with the all terrain wheels as well 
i do want one ,so where do you think you saw them on sale i will have a peek
and cheers for the message 
but i better not get my hopes up ,
