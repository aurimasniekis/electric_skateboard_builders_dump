I am (im)patiently awaiting my CGT 2 in 1 and wondering where you lucky owners have been riding - what is the most extreme terrain this thing will handle?  I live very close to the beach and am wondering if hard-packed sand is ok for example or if it's a big no-no.  Can't wait to get it and take it offroad!

What beach do you live close to?
The offload version would probably be fun in sand. the only concern that I would have is sand getting into the motors.
The iron in the sand would stick to the magnets

I'd also be a little bit worried about salt, and how that might corrode things. In particular I think riding on wet sand could be bad, you don't want salt water getting into your electrical bits.
