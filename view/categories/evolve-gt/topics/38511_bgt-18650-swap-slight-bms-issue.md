Hey guys,

I'm currently having a shop do an 18650 swap for me.
The pack reads fine in itself fine but 4 cells don't show up at the BMS.
I think we might miss a red wire that goes to a contact in the corner on the BMS, I'm not sure though.

So the voltage is exactly 3,6 volts lower than it should be

Oddly when we use an old BMS of mine that is electronically fried but electrically working we do get full voltage

Does anybody have an idea what could cause this?

Oh btw apparently there was a revision of BMS somewhere in the last 12 months, as the newer BMS is longer and slimmer
