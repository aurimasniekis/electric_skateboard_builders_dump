that's my hands ;) I got these when I did the Evolve GT France premiere two years go to support the local distributor. This are 135mm prototypes that never came out. The ride was not that exceptional.

So, no chance to put our hands on a set, eh? Now that you are here, could you tell us if there are more than one type of Evolve tire being offered out there?

well, I'm no more that close to the Evolve French distributor has they are doing there own stuff for Evolve, by Evolve, with Evolve; too much Evolve for me as I promote complete diversity. Too much of a sect for me with people defending the brand or getting in silence mode for few set of freebies. For the tires, except what you have on the website, I don't really have much info or behind the scene info.

Those tires look nice. I want to know if is possible to get a set. I like the mounts with reinforcement bars you sent @longhairedboy not so long ago. They are the inspiration for my custom mounts. Cheers bro.

I have an unused AT conversion kit for my Carbon GT with an extra tire, and two extra tubes, but I wasn't trying to part with it just yet, even though I've never used it. ever.  I can't imagine keeping it forever if I'll never use it

They look very similar to that except they have 5 spokes instead of 3

oh and they're 175 x 50 it appears as well
