Holly Molly!! Evolve just posted this in their australian home page. It's a render but is official. They announced ABEC 11 and Evolve "..have aligned even further to release a co-branded Electric Skate wheel. Expected release date approx. early October"

Apparently they are going to brand it "GT - F1"

:) think I they could have increased the core size to reduce some weight and cost while they were at it.

Have you read @ChrisChaput discussion of core vs wheel diameter? He seems to have put quite a bit of thought into its ratio after trying many different combinations.

Thanks for the tip, i bet it is this one you mean: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hub-motor-urethane-riding-qualities/27818/13

Looks interesting, I will read through it :)

Edit: Read half of it, and will leave it at that, what a mess. Conclusion: stick to my Kegels and dont buy the Raptor 2.

Well I have abec 11 90mm, 97mm, and 107mm and Kegals. Small kegals are my least favorite to be honest. The 107's are the best ride with the least rolling resisitance Ive experienced hands down. Id still recommend them.

I have those too, no complaints about them but the 107's roll very noticeably better. Those MBS 100's are way cheaper though

The MBS are great up to 20mph, for me above that they start to rumble, at 25 it's quite annoying, been thinking of shaving them down but don't wanna lose size

I don't know if its worth it to go from MBS to 107's, considering the price is 150$ for a set. At that rate I may as well just get some pneumatics or solid core 6"s

Cost isnt really a factor, beyond it just being the look and ride feel I want, I don't want it to draw attention from the PD.

Are you saying that you'll draw less attn by having 107's versus larger pneumatics?

Yes
They won't draw any more attention than the 100mm MBS
If I'm coasting on the board it's impossible to tell it's esk8 without getting eye level with the deck to see the motor, with 6" wheels riding around NYC assumption will always be esk8

Ah I see. That's never been a huge consideration for my area, I'm more interested in how it rolls in comparison to mbs, and is it even worth taking that step versus going to a 6" tire

```
Also from the few times I've tried an esk8 with 6-8" wheels I've found the turning/cornering ability miserable, I'm guessing that's where something like a trampa deck comes in.  It was practically unrideable at speed around city streets.

@psychotiller  sixshooter pneumatics turned great on a stiff wood deck. I wonder if somethkng else on the set up you tried was affecting their cornering ability.

Yeah they look to be new Superfly mold, and the contact patch dimensions confirm this.  Which is good, because that means any pulley that fits on their smaller wheels will also work. I know Chris Chaput joked that the only wheels that electric skateboarders don't use are, ironically, the older 107mm Electric Flywheels

55mm contact patch on the Abec11/Evolve
55mm CP on Superflys
58mm CP on E-flywheels

would you prefer a 6" pneumatic over the 107s? 

I'm debating on whether I should get a set of those holed out solid 6" PU wheels or if I should wait for these. I'm currently on slightly shaven MBS's and I can get around fairly well.

Ive been getting a lot of flat tires lately which has me slightly reconsidering but atm I still really like pneumatics. They offer adjustable ride comfort and characteristics by changing pressure and tread pattern and seem to offer supieror and more consistent traction. They cost 2-3x more,  are bulkier and get flats though. Probably depends on your application but for communting Id probably still want the pneumi's with the 107's a close 2nd and smaller urathane wheels a very distant 3rd.

funny he would joke about that. I think nobody was using them because nobody could fucking order them. 

Good ol' Chris. He probably just didn't like them for some reason and said fuck it. 

Those evolve wheels are just black superflys with paint. Maybe I should get some red ones. Oh wait.. metroboard....

Purple ones would be cool.

there are 2 version of the Electric Flywheels and the pink one is 62cp

I've ridden Abecs in 97, 107, pneumatics, the 100mm MBS and the new 107 and I like the SuperFlys the most, they are heavy but worth it

I've measured the MBS's, they're not actually 100. They're more like 97-98 at the very highest tread. After you shave it a little, it becomes 96-97 and after you shave through to the second from furthest outer tread, it becomes more like 95-96. 

MBS is a good wheel on a budget. But if you want a true 97, get the ABEC. It'll have a full 97mm diameter and a larger full contact patch. The only thing the full contact patch doesn't have is as smooth of a transition going up bumps at a 45 degree angle or less. The slight coned angle on the MBS allows the wheel to not catch a 'ridges' when riding near parallel to them.
