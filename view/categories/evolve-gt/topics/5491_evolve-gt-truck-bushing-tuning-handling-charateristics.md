I've posted this before but these are the cheapest, hardest and most durable bushings I've ever seen.

So cheap you should try them.

Rode these on Carbon, now Gt.

1 set per truck. So 2 sets.

They are just so hard! ( thats what she said ) They don't seem to degrade.

I'm used to double setup as have old evolve. I love speed, so they need to be tight and hard. So it holds you but still allows you to turn. This requires more leg strength especially on forehand turns.

You can have em loose and stay on eco or tight and hard for speed. It feels a bit different but you get used to tight setup. Everyone who jumps on my board says "wow Thats tight" but all those guys don't like to skate at round 40kmh. My original carbon got up to 37kmh so the speed i'm used to but the acceleration was a surprise.!!!lol

They are just cheap chinese bushings. Don't think skate shops have em.

Just have to try something else hard until they come.

Here is my ultimate setup...<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4d97e7313521d9276b4d6ecbd0ec848e96bbba49.jpg" width="281" height="500">

97mm abecs for street

Fancy brand names on left (doh dohs) vs cheap chinese.( on old carbon )

Both these have done 100+km

the chinese bushings have been on for ages they dont degrade, just slightly squash.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6af34937262a0ba0e43e697c29c80d942fb7511d.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Also @darkydawson, do you put the hard barrels on the top top bushing seat (1st tier truck) or the bottom top  bushing seat (2nd tier truck). I'm trying to figure out where to put these bushings to be most effective because it seems like no which truck I put them on they still wiggle to no end.

All of the above.

1 set does a whole truck. ie 1 barrell 1 cone for 1st tier and same for second tier.

@Mr_Mahal No a single set has 2 barrells and 2 cones. This will do a whole truck so 2 sets will do 2.

Sorry if I wasn't clear in my other post

These bushings are a bit higher but will fit on truck. Squash a bit over time.
Think @Rob.Endless may have ordered some.

@Mr_Mahal Here is a pic showing how tight my evolve bushings are on GT. You can get them tight enough. Should last couple of weeks.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/74af35cfa3fbf900d404a98905723c8ddf90e816.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I haven't changed em yet.

Tighten top bushings ( closer to deck ) first. Make sure they're tight. Then adjust bottom bushings ( closer to wheels ) The top ones need to be overall tighter and don't move much. Then bottom ones are used to control most of your turning, so fairly tight.

I also find that my back trucks are tighter than the front. It's always a balance of stability vs turning ease.

Try not to be discouraged @Mr_Mahal.  It has a lot to do with muscle memory. Keep at it and I think you'll adjust to the double trucks pretty quickly. Mine are fairly loose with standard trucks and have no wobble issues whatsoever.

This is correct !!!! 110% Tighten top bushings ( closer to deck ) first. Make sure they're tight. Then adjust bottom bushings ( closer to wheels ) The top ones need to be overall tighter and don't move much. Then bottom ones are used to control most of your turning, so fairly tight.

I also find that my back trucks are tighter than the front. It's always a balance of stability vs turning ease.

What i did i bought 2 pairs of bushings one for the top and one for the bottom. The top one are 98(more harder) and bottom one are 95 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/ba8b04db9aa58351bf6b333847e2fcc3330f3a15.jpeg" width="690" height="227">

  My weight is 175 lbs and this set up is amazing!! No wobble guarantee!  So the key is top bushings harder then bottom for stability and bottom soft but not that soft for good turnings  !!  Mr mahal this is the only way to have the perfect set up for stability vs turning with double trucks kingpin in IMO . <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f29b80805419e853ab93a6038b57f2a3b46cf4f2.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

And don't forget this part "back trucks are tighter than the front. so  The best way to find out you go outside with your T tool or skate tool  whatever you call it and follow the step above till you find the right spot for you !!!

Just kick starting this thread. I am using Venom DH Eliminatir stepped bushings 97a on rear truck both tiers and front board side/top tier  still experimenting with front truck street/bottom tier with various combos of softer duro and barrel cone combos. All bolted down firmly tighter than typical, but following the truism of front leads & rear wobbles lol

It might also be good if someone could take a photo of their Evolve GT from the side, then label each Bushing to clearly identify them...maybe a basic tutorial on how to tune it for less turn & more stability.... I think a noob would get confused with just words.

i had a pretty complicated layout in the end on my carbon (not gt), took me 2 days to end up like that. i was usually riding constant full throttle hard carving on at wheels!

boardside front and rear: ripride krank 93A barrel
boardside top bushing front and rear: bones hardcore hard

roadside rear krank 93A barrel, bones hardcore hard
roadsidefront krank 87A barrel, bones hatdcore 

most important for sidewinders: always cupped washer, these trucks otherwise become way overboard imprecise.

For those that were interested, the middle section of the sidewinder trucks can be removed for the front truck. However it is not possible on the back due to motor clearance. Even if a different base plate was used the motors would still sit under the deck with the stock hanger, therefore motorbite would become an issue.

Also of note the bushings are 55d cheapos from china that @darkydawson recommended. Can't go wrong for the price.

From these photos you can see the rear hanger does not sit in the base plate as the motors hit the deck first.

I've managed to dial the stock bushings in and find my board handles great, but I don't have a reference point with other bushings. I found there is a big difference even with just a 1/4 turn on the truck/ bushing nuts. What ride/ feel difference do you find in the bushing you have there @zoo?
```

## \#23 Posted by: zoo Posted at: 2016-07-04T08:20:47.186Z Reads: 382

```
Both the stock 95a bushings and the 55d (approx 100a) bushings I'm using at the moment can be tightened to the point the trucks are quite stiff. So either way the feel can be dialed in basically the same. I actually ride them a little looser now as the way I ride stability has not been an issue and I like to be able to turn sharp. The plus of using hard bushings is they should last longer and I've got 8 sets for each truck for the price of 1 evolve bushing set.

[/quote]

Try mounting truck on bottom of deck. Will give another 15mm of clearance for motors.

```
As can be seen from the second last photo, the hanger still has approx 10mm vertical distance to be seated properly. Then combined with the change of angle once it is seated correctly would push the motors at least another 5mm. So whilst it may just fit, you wont have much room to turn before the board hits the motors.

Also I was doing this to lower the center of gravity for AT setup. I was not too interested in changing the handling of the binding itself so changing where the truck is mounted won't really help in this case. My next preference would be to keep the trucks as standard but add a riser to the top of the board and get some longer bolts.

BTW guys, the only major noticeable difference between hard bushings including stocks is durability.

The Evolve bushings are fine. After enough kms I find most bushings start to disintegrate. The cheap chinese bushings seem to be the most durable.

Also the latest 55d's I got (black) seem a little different to my original white ones but I still haven't noticed any wear.
That cheap doesn't really matter.

Sorry @zoo didn't notice your older posts mate. Well said.

I replaced the stock bushings with [RipTide KranK short street barrels 93a maroon color.](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/bushings/71642/riptide-krank-short-street-barrel-longboard-skateboard-bushings-pack-9f25fbb8-2f5b-47c8-9a3e-4d9ef2c95e15)

I am completely satisfied with it. Tried leaving both bottom and top bushing nut flush with the bolt and could still ride at top speed and still be very carvy. I could not ride that fast with the stock bushings and keep the carvy depth at the same time.

However I did not need it to be that carvy, only enough to navigate 90 degree corners of footpaths is all I needed, so I tightened the board side bushing just a bit and the roadside bushings a very tiny bit and could not be happier with the result.

This thread has "Handling characteristics", so I am posting about what I assume is the lack of traction control on the Evolve GT's?

It becomes noticeable when I go near or over 40kmh/25mph, especially on upward slopes. The back side of the board would go along nicely then want to go to the right and then either back to straight or over to the left by varying degrees before going straight again.

Not really a problem with the AT's, but then it only goes to 35kmh on these things. I know what speed wobbles are and had experienced these when I first start riding, but this is not it.

I have been riding for half a year and have not fell off from this sort of behavior and have gotten used to it. ( just would be nice if this thing would go away ) It is more of the feel of power pushing the back from one side to the other which is what I mean by being more noticeable when going up slopes due to powered wheels pushing against gravity.

Discussing this because this is just my own presumption that the GT's do not have traction control as opposed to knowing this for certain.

I have read in other threads that traction control generally is not missed if there is none. This is not the case for me, but then perhaps the quote "generally not missed" is for slower boards?

I highly recommend my setup. I weigh 140lbs, but I ride this setup relatively loose, so it will work for heavier riders as well. On the boardside of both kingpins, I have the red RipTide APS barrel bushings with a 95a duro. On the roadside, I have the green RipTide APS Street Series short barrels with 97.5a duro. I have gone 33.5 mph with this setup (very stable) and the bird is still extremely playful at low speeds. I am an experienced longboarder, so I've never really had any speed wobble issues, but these feel very stable at high speed and the APS bushings turn 10% - 15% more than other bushings with the same durometer. I have tested with around 6-7 different setups, alternating bushing shapes and duros, and this is by far the best.
