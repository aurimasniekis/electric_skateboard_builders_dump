As an fyi for everyone, GT pulley uses a larger 10mm bearing and will not fit most trucks. The wheel uses a more common 8mm axle. I wouldn't recommend you try to buy the gt pulley for your diy build unless you don't mind the extra work.

I swapped out the evolve 83mm wheels for the 97mm Abec 11 flywheels (same 15/32 for both). Unlike most the commentary, I preferred evolve 83mm wheels. I live in an area with plenty of undulating hills to bomb up and down, and it feels to me like the torque of these motors using the 32 tooth pulley is tuned better for the 83mm wheels. The board felt much more responsive and alive, and the evolve wheels have a wider contact patch with the road, so they feel grippier and allow harder carving on the downhill runs. I'd like to try the 38 tooth pulley with the 97mm wheels to see how that runs. Not really interested in the higher top end speed of the 97mm + 32 tooth,- these boards handle great up to 32 km/h. I don't have a comparison, but I feel there are better boards (larger motors and high-speed stable trucks) for going close to 42km/hr. Maybe I'll change my tune once 32 km/h stops feeling quick. I didn't find much difference in terms of vibration, the 97mm are certainly better on paved footpaths, but I tend to ride in bikelanes on the road- no real advantage. Anyways, I found I prefer the standard wheel setup.

Yeah I might @zoo. I was going to keep them in case I decided to increase the speed more down the track. If you aren't in Australia the shipping might be hexy though. Let me know. I bought them from the evolve website and they have maybe 5 kms on them- they are brand new.

Quick questions on wheels, I am switching over from street setup to try AT for awhile instead.  What tire pressure are you guys riding on the stock AT evolve tires, and any different for real offroad vs streets/parks combo?

Secondly, I picked up these 8" MBS T3 Knobby tires and installing them on evolve 7" hubs, more or less tire pressure you think as these are less tuned for streets.

Lastly, I got a few tire/wheel color variations lol, green/yellow tires and pink/camouflage wheel hubs...which combo looks best lol!

I reinstalled the 97mm Flywheels today. I take back my previous assessment. I found them excellent. I think I never put the board in GT mode before (and the road was wet + I was not as stable as I am now). In GT mode in clear weather I really enjoyed the addition top speed, the extra thane definitely makes rubbish roads or footpaths much smoother, and they just roll. As someone previously mentioned, they also smooth out the torque on take off a little. I'm a convert. I'd love to see a board with a raptor dual setup that can take 97mm flywheels (no doubt someone's done it). That would be a sweet ride I imagine with the beefier motors.

Btw, spent time on the 38T street wheel pulley last week. I found it to feel noticeably different. More acceleration torque, at expense of only 1moh top speed. The more significant difference was in braking lol. Luckily I was initially cautious and first tried acceleration in fast mode, not GT.  Not thinking about it much, I softly braked as usual and almost got thrown off the front of my deck at modest speed!  Worth trying vs 32T, I am leaning towards leaving them on.

Yeah, it's not that it lacks torque, but for some large hill bombing I can tell the motor is in a happier place with the 83's than with the 97 mm. But you are right, I went 97s partly for the comfort, mostly to get the extra speed. Probably just need to change between 83s and 97s depending on whether I'm hitting the big hills all day for carving (I find the 83's more grippy for hard carving), or more speeding around elsewhere. Speed is one of those things I'm finding that slowly becomes a problem.... a couple months back 30 km/h seemed quick to me, now 39 seems mundane!  I don't reach the 40's on this board, do you?

I'll have to check the clearance on the pulley and motor mount. If it sticks out the other way, its fine, i just wont use the belt cover. The other issue is the grub screw location on all the pulleys i see online. Its not within the tooth itself, which means there is a section of the pulley, like a collar basically that will stick out. This can be an issue if the motor shaft is not long enough for the grub screw to catch. I will take pics later to tonight when i get home.

Hmmm, I thiught I usually see motor pulleys with grub screws in teeth as well as versions not in teeth. Worst case, you can always downsize to a 12mm belt. Sacrilege, I know but probably work just fine if the 15mm motor pulley sticks out extra depth of a grub screw and not perfectly line with wheel pulley. Or just put a few extra speed washers in axel and move wheel and wheel pulley out a grub screw distance.

Sorry, got home late last night...no pictures. So, evolve just replied and said a whole new motor assembly cost $189. A simple worn out motor pulley is going to cost $189.....pretty ridiculous on parts support on Evolves part. They should be able to provide the pulley itself. I think it is made out of aluminum and not steel.

Hi all - my first post here. Ordered my gt carbon 2in1a couple of days ago and excited!  I've already found this forum useful so thank you. 

My question is about wheel sizes and I'm hoping you can please help.  Roads around here (Adelaide, South Australia) are fairly rough and I am questioning my choice of the 83mm Evolve wheels. I don't care about top speed, but I want the smoothest possible ride on the street setup.  I actually rang Evolve today to ask their opinion of whether I should go for something else (eg the 97s) but the dude said that they were harder and thus the 83mm Evolve wheels were a good choice.   Whilst he seemed nice i didn't feel like overall i got the best advice.  I'm happy to change my choice and don't want to find that i never set up the street wheels because of a bad decision - so what do you all think? What are the smoothest wheels on potentially rough roads?

Thanks in advance!

Well, he is correct... **but**
they offer evolve wheels 83mm 76a
and flywheels 97mm 78a

So the flywheels are 2a harder.... But if you can get 97mm 75a they will be better than the evolve ones...

I agree, the 97mm in 75a is the biggest and softes wheel you can get.
If Evolve don't offer them, get them elsewhere, but you'll have to try very hard to get some, they are very popular and 95% sold out.

Evolve doesn't make the wheels, just the wheel pulleys that insert into them. All of this is more clear when you get your deck!  You can buy the wheels anywhere, just need to make sure they are the right ones. If 97mm then either ABEC genuine or clones. Easier to know what durometer you are getting with genuine abecs as will be specified. Clones not so much, but 1/4 the price. If clones then need to get the ones with thin spokes as the thick spoke versions are harder to fit the evolve wheel pulley inserts into. My experience at least has been on ebay where one seller lucky930 sold me thin spoke version and a2zezshop sold the thick version which did not fit well without modification.

The pulley that goes on the evolve 83mm is also used with the 97mm Abecs. There is another optional pulley with different number of teeth which will give you more torque but less top speed.

Although I haven't done any form of rigorous testing, empirically, I noticed that I have to charge my board more often. So for sure I'm getting less range with the 97's. How much less? I can't say. I'll have to start logging range data for that.

New to forum. Very help[full! About to order my first Evolve Carbon GT. Previous Boosted owner. Debating wheel sizes. Looks like most prefer 97m but Evolve also mentions having a 90 option. Don't need to go much over 20-22 mph and wondering if that might be a happy compromise. My area is very hilly (about 10-15 deg max). Also very few mention the 38T option.

Hey I have just put on my ATs and I have to say I have been surprised how much friction there is now compared to the 83mm. The engines make a lot of noise and it rolls down hill pretty slowly now so I end up using the motors downhill to get a good speed on gentle slopes. I'm not sure if I have installed them correctly. I have tried loosening and tightening the belts and only makes a small difference. I've inflated the tyres to the spec. I'm not sure what else to do?

@asuras the bore size is 8mm

If your in the US I sell a pulley similar to this for $11, but in steel so it will last much much longer. It comes with grub screws and 3mm keyway with key included. @Fiori has used them on his evolve with good success

Yes the pulleys are 15mm wide.

I'm a very heavy user of my Evolve for the last six months and still have no issues with the wheel pulleys.

No I'm not in the US... would you consider posting them overseas (Australia)? Although I have no idea what the postage would be...
I can probably survive with my banged up pulley for now but if it eats another rock I should probably replace it. Seems wise to use a steel one.

Hey errbody, I am compiling a spreadsheet of parts & specifications for the C-GT board to help owners source cheap spares, addons and accessories. Here's what I've done so far; the link below will allow you to comment on the spreadsheet. If you've got information to add to the spreadsheet you can type a comment onto it, comment on this thread, or send me a message and I'll put it in the spreadsheet. 

Info on any of the following goes in there:
* Battery Chargers
* Bearings
* Belt Pulleys
* Bindings
* Carry Bag
* Controller
* Liquids / Greases
* Puncture Protection
* Rims / Hubs
* Safety Gear
* Screws / Fixings
* Timing Belt
* Tires
* Trucks
* Wheels

I'm particularly keen to find sources for any parts that are cheaper than what Evolve does them for or cheaper than what I have in the spreadsheet. Also if you live in a part of the world where certain spares are hard to source and you've found a place to get them, that's useful information for others too.

Thanks for the mention. For my steel pulleys to fit evolve light sanding may be required for "key" to fit, but it should fit snug. Loctite is a must. Also @Fiori  mentioned to me that the flange might be need to be removed for clearance issues in AT mode specifically. The flange is easy to remove (permanently) with pliers.

I have that setup and it rides just like riding stock torque wise. Unfortunately, range takes a huge hit. I can barely get 15 miles in Fast mode which is 30% less than with 83mm, but I have huge hills.I may sell the 38t and go with 83mm 75a flywheels 32t setup for more range in exchange for smoothness. I haven't done a range test with 97mm and 32t. Will have to do that sometime and compare differences for the 97mm flywheels.

I put 20T pulleys on my board. I also have the 97mm 75a FlyWheels. The board can do 33 mph, but you do draw quite a bit more amps, especially when going uphill, so it does take a toll on the range. I just ordered an 18T pulley, which I think will be the perfect balance of speed and torque for my riding style. 26 mph (24 mph most of the time) got pretty boring for me. With the 18T, I should be able to still hit 30, but also not wreck my battery life. If anyone has any info on a battery builder that could make me a better quality battery for my board that won't sag as much, I would appreciate it. That is the one last thing I would like to improve on my board now. Here is a screenshot of me doing 33!

Hey all, I did a quick calculation of motor gear / wheel gear / and wheel size ratio and the possible speed to achieve on an Evolve GT skateboard. I saw on the forum 'tequilaman' verified that the motor gear of 20 teeth, with 97 mm wheel size achieves 33mph (that's slower than the calculated 34mph but probably due to increase wind resistance). The 107mm requires shaving 10mm off the width of the wheel to accommodate the rear wheel install.

Is it possible to achieve the theoretical 38mph? (or does the increase wind resistance at high speed make this not possible). Of course, throw the acceleration factor out completely if you want to achieve the top speed.

What is everyone's sweet spot on torque and speed and wheel size. It a balance game between distance, ride comfort, torque, and speed.

Thanks for pulling together that data set.  I can validate the 107mm on 15/32 and 15/38 looks correct (depending on rider weight etc).  There are other eSk8 in NYC that ride 20T on the motor side, maybe they can weigh in on 20T for 97mm wheels, thouhg moste are doing it DIY not CGT.  I have settled on 97mm on 15/38, and more likely to tune it for torque than topspeed for nyc esk8.  Don't know of anyone trying 20T on 107mm yet, but torque would suffer so much that only do it for science lol!!

I used my calculator to go a bit deeper into this (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/path-of-esk8-build-tree/16774/19)

For my understanding of physics, torque is independent on wheelsize, it is messured at the axle.
But the wheelsize defines the force that is put on the road which defines acceleration and hill climbing.

about the same data as above:

What is the procedure for taking the pulley off of the motors?
Then, can they be put back on?
It looks like the 20mm pulleys need a shim and the hex nut. 
In any case is locktight used?  
Will locktight release its hold if you heat it with a torch?

Great torque Calc table.  Thanks.   Can everyone weight in in their favorite gear and wheel setup of speed vs comfort vs distance vs torque?

I have 76mm / 15t-32t.   Man the torque is insane but it's like riding a low rider.  You feel every bump and crack.  Very rough ride. 

I am leaning heavily towards 107mm / 15t-38t but hesitant due to lost of distance.  Can anyone please tell me what distance they are getting out of that setup in stock battery?  Also this setup is costly because I have to buy another gear set.

In my experience, wheel size makes a huge difference in range. 

Everything tested on Fast mode only on the same route.
**Rider weight:** 105kg

**83mm**
15-32T: 18-20mi
15-38T: Yet to test. Too damn slow. Probably bore myself to death.
20-32T: 16-18mi
20-38T: Don't have a long enough belt.

**97mm**
15-32T: 13-15mi
15-38T: 12-14mi
20-32T: LOL
20-38T: Same as above. 

Also I'm selling my 38T gear set. So I'll probably never get around testing it. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

So I get faster speed and longer range with 83mm 20-32T than 97mm 15-32T. Wonder what the results would be like for a 50-65kg rider? In this case it seems I get 25% less range with 97mm wheels.

Range should not heavily depend in wheelsize, it should be about 10Wh/km (more or less)
Maybe the range lost is to heavy Voltage Sag, so it's maybe a problem of the battery, not sure

Can you compare the Voltage Sag on different wheels?

## \#92 Posted by: Aeroquiv Posted at: 2017-05-01T19:24:45.068Z Reads: 263

it's a carbon. I still have to try to calculate the internal battery resistance. My route requires me to stop a lot. So it's possible I notice a significant range penalty because I have to decelerate and accelerate so often. If I was in a scenario where I stayed at a constant speed until depletion on level ground, then perhaps the wheel size and unsprung weight wouldn't matter as much.

When I have the time, I'll try an experiment to calculate internal resistance by doing several acceleration runs in fast mode since it limits to 20 amps. It would be much easier in a controlled environment with the battery alone, but I just don't have the equipment. So there will probably be many sources of error.

Installed the 38t pulley on the stock 15t and 83mm wheels. The top speed is 19mph yes, however you get there much faster. If hills are what you ride on all day, this is a fantastic set up. 
Last month I upgraded to 97mm 32t and hit 25mph on the flats all the time in fast, 20 in eco.Down hill hit speeds of 32-36.  Up hill was slower and in GT I would stay on the power down to 0% then hit battery drain usually right at the top of the hill. Turn it back on and it would bounce back to 68% or whatever.
Now riding with the 38t and 83mm. Up hill in fast or GT, much less sag from the battery. Braking is much more powerful and it seems like a lot more recovery as well. I road twice as many hills as normal and went faster up them and never had the board shut off on me. The battery motor and controller were all very hot.  
Does the 20t pulley on the thread above work on these motors?

Haven't heard the GTX belts being any different than other GT but you need to be sure to correctly specify to the wheel type (street or AT) and wheel pulley teeth count (32 or 38) as these affect belt specs etc.  Once you have the belt right, easy to source from various vendors from Aliexpress to vbelt or polybelt or etc

So I picked up the Evolve GTX 97s for my Carbon GT and I LOVE them. The new top speed is awesome and I love the new torque curve....however.
I had a little rub in the beginning and now I can hear the belt rubbing against the wheel. 
I've tried adding spacers until there is no more room left for spacers (3 on the inside, 1 on the outside) I even tried 4 on the inside and none on the outside (around the block) and still got rub.
I tightened everything but I can't get the rub to stop. I called Evolve and they said to check motor mount fasteners and they're fine so I really don't know what to do. The board has already been sent back for a bad motor controller so I don't really want to loose it for another 2 weeks. Also the wheels are blowing themselves to pieces. Evolve said they will replace the wheels but I can't help but think this will happen again. They look worse than my Boosted V2 D+ wheels which have gone 500+miles and these new Evolve 97s have barely gone 100mi. I might have to get the flywheels but I don't like the green.  

TLDR; anyone else running the Evolve 97s and getting rub/know a fix?
