I actually contacted the manufacturer on Alibaba the other day when I ran up on these.  Its a nice looking board and the flex battery enclosure is sweet.  The sample price is $750 though, pretty steep for a test.  Also, I dont believe the range and speed, not at 36v with 950w motors.  Here's what they said to me...

anyone known why these people call them "samples". I'm just wondering because when I go to Costco, samples are free. Why don't they just say $750 for one board?

Check out the Bisek thread for this one.  I've ridden one - first generation I think. Remote cut out every 2 seconds, making it pretty impossible to ride.  Also the bushings were insanely soft for some reason and I'm only 135 lbs so that is saying something.

Bizarre thread, I actually have both of these decks. I bought them while waiting for my evolve CF GT this summer. First is a NextGen "spine" and second is a Bisek CF hub. Both about same price delivered to nyc. The Bisek was more of an experiment to compare with Carvon's. The NextGen is actually super flexy and a real beast of a performer and I don't let people borrow it afraid it will toss them or SYF, seriously. Anyone in NYC wants to try them lmk lol.

I can verify the battery, top speed and acceleration are correct if not more actually. The range not so much. I pulled it apart considering some mods. The build has a screwy gearing ratio on proprietary parts and electronics. Surprising torque for low gearing ratio that resulted in better top speed. Would have to check but was something odd like 17/23 for motor/wheel pulley lol.

I actually work in a company that literally get free samples of food constantly. So it confuses me when Alibaba sellers says sample... Anyway sorry to go off on a tangent as usual
