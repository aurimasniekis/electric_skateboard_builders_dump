So I am thinking about buying this for christmas.   http://actonglobal.com/blink-s2/. I just wanted to ask you guys first because this community I awesome.
Is the brand known. And whuold you recommend this board. All information i handy.        


Thanks Reuben

It all depends on your needs, I suppose. My personal opinion is that, if this if you're on a budget or if you are new to e-boarding, then I believe that the S2 will the best choice out there. It won't be the best board out there (not by a long shot), but I do expect it to be a solid board at a great price point. I have a Blink Hub myself, I'm happy with it, and I'm looking forward to their new models. 

That being said, I'm pretty sure my opinion here is a minority one. Unlike well known brands like Boosted or Evolve, Acton has stronger ties to Chinese manufacturers. For example, you'll see that their remotes, trucks, and hub casings are identical to eWheelin boards. I think this is the main issue I think most folks have with Acton. If you have more money to spend, and would like to wait a while longer for something top-notch, I'd recommend Mellow Drive (Board Choice + Swappable Battery + Waterproof), Enertion Raptor 2 (Great Hubs; All-Rounder), Evolve GT (Offroading; Range). The Qu4tro looks cool, but I think the Raptor 2 would probably win out. I'm guessing the Qu4tro would get you maybe a little extra inclined, but the Raptor 2 would have more range and higher top speed.

I would be careful with range numbers... If you are riding in an environment with any amount of hills or are a taller/heavier person, or both (like I do), you won't get close to the numbers they advertise. Range is one of the easiest numbers to bs, because you have no idea usually how they even come up with it.

I don't think these boards will be total crap, but when you look at prices in this industry, you generally get what you pay for... If a board is at a low price, expect a low quality board compared to what what else is out there. I expect they will have a lot of motor overheating issues.

I personally don't see how they can do this. They must be using a very cheap esc and motor. A decent quality hub motor should cost no less than $150 IMO, the even better ones are $200+ per motor. Then you have a battery, which should be no less than $200 if you want a short range. $300+ if you want a decent range (like what you want). So we are at $600-$700, and we still need speed controllers. High quality speed controllers go for $180 a piece, so your up to $780-$880 for the single, $1060-$1160 for a dual. Then add another $100 for the deck with enclosure. And another $100 for the connectors, wiring, bms, and other little parts. so your up to $980-$1080 for a single and $1260-$1360 for a dual drive with high quality parts, and this is assuming you get the motors and battery at manufacturer bulk pricing cost. bulk pricing of the esc of a lesser quality could save to $100 per esc, so you could potentially pull it down a bit more. But as a company selling completes, they would need to spend at least $800 for a single drive and $1000 for a dual drive. And to the consumer, they would need to mark it up at least 10 percent.

So you can see, it costs a lot to create a high quality board. To bring costs down, and offer the insanely low prices they do, they must shave quality. I would say these boards will be a great gift for kids or young adults to play with as toys. But they are just that in my mind, a toy. They are not a high speed, long range transportation devices, which is more what I would imagine you would want, based on your reason for buying one in the first place...

This high speed, long range portion of the market is small right now, and your options for such are limited. Evolve and Enertion are the two best that come to mind. Ollin board company will have one soon that will destroy everything, and I'm working on a complete that can compete in this portion of the market also.

Just ask yourself what your goals are with an eboard, and understand that the numbers they give in terms of top speed, range, ect. are usually based on light people and while going on flat or downhill only. On my board, 1 block up hill = 5 blocks of flat = 8 blocks downhill. Board manufacturers will never give you these kinds of numbers, because they don't want you to think hard about it. On my normal route, with over $300 of battery cells alone, I only get 5 miles with solid performance before I sag down to 0%. Get rid of the hills, and 10 miles easily. Half my weight, and 20 miles easily. Board manufacturers will always give you the best looking number they can come up with, so just be careful :)

If you are looking for a reliable 10km board, I'd recommend the Yuneec Ego. Mine has been extremely reliable and I keep it around in addition to my Evolve Carbon and DIY boards. 

It just works. Gets 10-11 MILES of range and does 12-13 mph. In an urban environment, this works well as I have found that 15-16 MPH seems to be the fastest I want to go around traffic (cars pulling out of alleys, UBER drivers, etc). 

You can also fit all the components on a shorter deck which makes it even more practical

I just preordered one, $530 shipped seems like a good starting point for my short commute/ new hobby. 

Definitely struggled with considering the Raptor2, but the lightness/compactness of the s2was a big factor, as was cost of course. 

This post on the Reddit sub is interesting:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/6/7698aa376c8bf42307c5b8806ae363c13d2b5256.PNG" width="281" height="500">

The Carvon emc2 which is speculated to share hub components with the Acton s2 has a 2500 mAh battery, but I haven't been able to find this metric on the s2 - it is reported to have 160Wh however, so assuming 36V like the Carvon = 4444 mAh? Please do correct me if I'm wrong, am completely new to this world and am just basing this on a google search that showed the following: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/4/e4f19ac3939300bbce0cddc0beeff1fe9b5faeb2.PNG" width="281" height="500">

I would be shocked if 2500 mAh gets you 5 miles... Unless you weight 120 pounds, ride in super flat and downhill environments only, and at 12 mph max in the lowest torque mode.

Honestly, I use a 10000 mAh and I barely get 5 miles... This is due to the fact I weight 200 pounds, live in a super hilly environment, and like to ride above 20 mph at all times. Again, there's hypothetical and there's the real world, and the real world is never a perfect scenario.

they are using range number from the factory. not real world because it doesn't seem like there is a single skater in the company, aside form the ones they pay in their videos...

the older actons were claiming. 6-7 miles. users are reporting 3/4miles! not surprising since they are using **cheap low discharge, low capacity batteries.**

$500 seems cheap compared to other boards. when you consider you can order from china(randomly branded) for $300.

or build a real custom board for about $600 :thinking::sunglasses:

Saul, 

Do you know which batteries are being sold on the s2? I've not found anything definitive from Acton except that they are 160Wh (found this info when researching the possibility of air travel w/ board) which assuming 36V ~ 4300mAh, which jives with the specs of the "Koowheel" board which is claimed to be derived from the same/similar hardware (or straight up re-badged?)

I definitely plan on building up an electric board myself, but for the price I figured this isn't a bad way to go as I get into the hobby and learn. Perhaps I'm mistaken however, I admittedly am ignorant and there isn't as much info to go on as I'd hoped.

I've got quite a large quiver, having been pretty active in the downhill scene, so I'm considering cancelling my Acton order and instead going with an Eon or Dash drive system... had been following mellow but it's just too much$.

Ha! I wrote that post on reddit.

I ended up just building my own using Carvon 2.5 dual hubs.
It was a lot more expensive. But I am pretty happy with it.  I even think I might go ahead and build a single hub too.

I see that single hub drives are pretty common, but I'd assumed that this kind of setup would negatively affect handling, having weight and drive coming from one corner? And wouldn't the urethane on the drive wheel wear faster than the rest, compounding this asymmetry?

I don't think it would make that much of a difference unless you like showing off and have your board do burnouts and stuff. Also peep the V3's they use regular wheels so you could just rotate them like normal wheels.

if its 160whr then i'm pretty sure its the same battery as koolwheel/genisis/..../
from what I can tell they are using 2200mah 10A discharge cells, basically what hoverboards used but boards push them harder so the life is going to be really bad. voltage sag and horrible real world range.

I have 2 single drive boards, if i'm right you only push with one foot and there have been no issue with that? lol
since the width of the wheels is so small  there is not really noticeable torque steer or anything like that.

with a custom board you have real, proven longboard components, on a china board you have real cheap components! lol

would you slide on a walmart board? :head_bandage:

So if it's 160Wh and 2200 mAh, that means it's 72V? (assuming that formula is correct: Watt hour / Voltage x 1000 = mAh)?

And I kick on both sides when doing any distance, was a big fan of Chris Yandall and his "skogging" method - regular, switch, mongo, switch mongo. I like symmetry. ;)

Ah, I see. Perhaps I should just build my own, as the dual drive modular units are pretty spendy themselves.. $850 for the Eon, $650 for the Dash and ~ $1600 for mellow.. Or just go with a cheaper single drive unit for now, while working on a build. 🤔

If there is a board on the market at only 1k, be affriad, because they are not using high quality parts. you need to add 20-30% mark up to the diy price, so really, that 999 board likely costs them $600 at most. I already showed you that you can't do that with quality parts...

Tons of "real, prove longboard components" are made in China though. When I was first getting into DH, Paris were the best trucks available, for instance. The really integral parts of a setup whose failure can be catastrophic during a slide are all made in China, or at least 95% - bearings, spacers, nylon lock nuts.. so yeah I wouldn't be overly concerned sliding a "Walmart board" like Kryptonics.

Well those prices are the cost for you and I to build a board.  But you tell a manufacturer that you've got a million dollars in pre orders and I'm sure you can make our a lot cheaper with out shaving quality. Example; costco sells prefab vanities for an incredible price. If i build these exact same vanities with materials bought at lowes, it would cost me triple what costco sells it for. And mine wouldn't be as nice. Manufacturing, marketing and distribution is a successful business for a reason. Wait til the boards are out and then we'll review and critique them to prove or disprove their quality.

I don't think you understand... I have been in contact with manufacturers about bulk prices. I've been in the process of sourcing parts for a board I hope to release near the beginning of next year. I'm telling you, that even if I order enough parts for 100 boards at once, your still looking at no less than $4 per 18650 if your lucky (you'll likely get fakes at that price), more likely $5 per cell. You need at least 40 cells to get a fair range, so that's $5 times 40, which is $200 in cells at the lowest price possible. Motors, the cheapest I can get is $80 per motor, plus the bulk pricing paris truck deal hummie gets still is another $20 plus shipping, so about $200 for the motors. Then esc's, you might be able to get down to $50 for a decent esc if your buying massive bulk. That's $500, and that doesn't include the board, the wheels, the bearings, and everything else you need. The hobby price of a board like this is more like $1500, instead of the $1200 price I quoted. You might be able to get this down to $700 if your really good about finding deals, and ok with taking risks with fake parts. But if you want high quality parts from respected manufacturers, you will pay more for the quality.

You just can't build a high quality board this cheap, even if your getting mass produced bulk pricing... I'm in this boat right now. I'm not making these statements from ignorance, I'm stating what I have found from the last 6 months of research and contacting manufacurers.

Well it looks like the battery is 20 cells, I emailed Acton and they confirmed it's the 4400 mAh 36V, and previous statements mentioned Samsung and 160Wh so must be this one right? 18650?

https://fullbattery.com/products/37v-lithium-battery-pack?variant=25355037766

So that's a $80 battery, retail. So assuming when one orders in thousands rather than hundreds, perhaps it's $70 or $60? That would shave your estimate down to $380 or $390, leaving $110-$120 for wheels, deck, bearings and hardware. Now, that doesn't leave much room for any margin, but it got us to talk about it.. selling near cost during a product introduction isn't a radical business strategy - do you think enertion would turn much of a profit selling the raptor2 for $900? Of course not, they're using the same basic marketing strategy.

If 40 cells is decent range, the s2 must have half decent range right?! (Maths!)

Thats exactly what I just said.... :smirk:

and again if that is the battery.
Samsung 18650 22p cells
Max. continuous discharge current: 10A
Nominal capacity: 2150mAh

10A MAX discharge means these are being pushed to their limits. Just like you see with bb users will discharge till empty, then charge, and start riding right away. This means the cells will probably die in 1/4 their stated lifetime because their measurements are usually based on .2C discharge. 

and as for other longboard parts. yes paris and other brands are also made in china. But You have actual brand to hold acceptable for quality, as opposed to generic parts that can be made by a number of factories with no proven record. 

and well its a good thing that you're ok with a "krptonics" quality board, it seems like that all you want. Please wear proper saftey gear, you are most likely going to need it. :sob:

if your riding a board with a 10s2p only, your not getting close to 20 miles, heck, with a very efficient system, your going to get 4 or 5 at best. My first board was a very efficient enertion belt drive system (r-spec, enertion mount and belt and gearing). on an 8000 mAh, I could get about 6 miles. by that logic, 4-5 miles.

And these are hubs, so you'll get even less range...

Not to mention, hubs pull more current. And at 10s2p, those cells are actually rated to 20 amp continuous cells, so you can do 40 amps continuous in a 2p, but you will sag soo bad, that it's not even funny. 10 amp continuous is probably what they can do without sagging, but you need so much more than that. I'm pulling my max, 72 amps, on certain hills, and even on flat, I pull 20-30 amps. 10 amps will give you an extremely weak acceleration, and won't be able to climb even a moderate incline.

For belt driven systems, you might be able to get away with it a bit better. But not with hubs.

If you want a toy, buy this. It will probably bring you a lot of fun. But it is just that... A toy. This is not a device for serious commuting. I would not rely on it to get me to class or work on time.

What? There's 2 sets of 10 cells each right? So 2150 x 2 = 4300 mAh total, unless I'm misunderstanding something? You and others in this thread keeps saying "oh 2500 mAh won't be enough juice" but isn't the total capacity a function of mAh and wH? Doesn't this battery have a much high wH rating than the boosted? 99wH vs 158wh? I'm confused. How does one calculate the discharge rate?

Regardless, I'm not trying to commute from the suburbs, I live right off of a huge bike path that cuts under the streets, my work is .9 miles from my home. Mostly flats. Also I actually skate, so I'm not afraid of brakes failing - I can stop just fine without them. I don't want a giant monstrosity of a longboard - like almost everyone else who skates DH, short wheelbase topmounts are my preference. 

So, I get that a lot of this community values speed and hill climbing and distance, but those just aren't my priorities. If I can get a few miles between charges I'll be good.

Wow, alright then. You know what's even more important than equipment and safety gear? Proficiency. Almost every electric skate video I've seen looks... dangerous. 

Paris was an unknown brand 10 years ago, people said the same things then that you are saying now. I'm not convinced.

So, in other words it sounds like it might fit my needs. If I can get 4-5 miles and not have to lug around a 20lb behemoth, I'm good. Short wheelbase and narrow hangers = a setup that can _turn_. I like turning. Had to lol at that evolve GT - ridiculously long wheelbase and dropped platform for "stability" @ a whopping 26mph... then they go and put the kookiest trucks imaginable on it so it just _might_ be able to do a uturn on a 4 lane hwy.. there's clearly a lot of understanding of engineering, but not much knowledge of skating.

Ha, I've heard so many people disparage skateboarding in similar fashion, but usually its folks who have never touched a skateboard that make such remarks.

Is it ok with everyone if I don't need or want a "serious" commuting skate? Is fun ok? Expression? Is a paintbrush a "toy" because it doesn't get you get to work on time? :rolling_eyes:

A paint brush is a toy when it does a half ass job at what it is suppose to do.

I've been a heavy street skater for 10 years now. I'm not a n00b to this stuff. Your right about evolve. I find the fact they use a drop through with those trucks absurd.

I used to skate everywhere's in SF by pushing on my normal street deck. I love to push, and electric skateboards will never stop me from pushing (heck, I even push on my eboard from time to time, which is one of the beauties of hubs).

What makes something a toy is that it is likely to break quickly, and cost a fraction of the respected board companies, not because they use a smaller battery or motors ect. but because they skimp on quality parts and engineering. I already broke down how you never get close to its range and will have very little power under your feet. If someone feels the need to exaggerate numbers this badly, I would not trust them with my life, which is what your doing on any thing you ride in the street with.

Like I said, if you want a toy to play with, this will likely do the job. But you want something reliable, this is not it. Never thought I'd say this, but if you really want something light and reliable, buy a boosted. There's a reason they are not $700, and it's not just because they have a larger markup...

What if the discharge rate was like 10A continuous, 20A max? Looking around there are 10s2p 4400mAh 36v batteries with specs along those lines available.. and how do you explain all the YouTube videos showing decent range and speed with the "koowheel" boards which are speculated to share drive components, and are the same price range? There is a mashables video showing the s2 proto going several miles with ok acceleration... faked, or what?

There's batteries of all specs imaginable available, so that means nothing...

What I'm saying is 10a continuous is very low for an electric skateboard.

Watching videos on youtube tell you very little... There's no science behind them, unless they have video overlays that give data straight from the esc's. This is why I have spent over 100 hours developing software for in app video overlays. This gives more data about the performance of the board at any given time. To use my software though, you need a vesc, and boards in this price range will never use an esc as nice as the vesc, because it's too expensive.

Videos are deceptive. You can be going 15 mph and make it look like 30 mph if you get the right angles with the right lenses. Video overlays with speed data straight from the esc remove this illusion, but even most overlay videos on youtuve uses gps data. GPS data can be very inaccurate, so even those videos are invalidated.

And the s2 videos your seeing are prototypes, not the final board. Imboard did the same thing... They showed these great videos, and the final product is nothing like the prototype they sold everyone on...

You also need to be careful, because companies like this love to use light riders. The reality is, the biggest environmental factor on torque and top speed is weight. When you have someone whose 100 pounds and someone whose 200 pounds, those motors have to work twice as hard to move that 200 pound person. This means you need twice the continuous amps, which will half the range, ect...

I get, you want to validate your purchase. If your light and its your first board, you'll be happy with it. But you'll get bored quickly with the lack of torque. One day, after I release my board, I hope to compare these boards to show the world how weak these boards are.

Besides the reasons I have listed, being a street skateboarder, I'm sure you know how important is is to support the skateboarding community. The same is true for the electric skateboard community. Buying these boards from china do nothing for the community, but sink us into a deeper hole. The same thing happens every time you buy a deck from some off brand china board instead of supporting your local skate shop or skate companies.

Sure, no data overlays but one can get some insight into range and speed watching a 40 minute streamed ride through real life city start and go traffic, narrated by a guy whose job is reviewing shit for a tech website... Perhaps it'll a bait and switch, but I don't get why a company would invest so much time and money into marketing if they were just planning on running their reputation..

I mean wtf makes one company a purveyor of "off brand china boards" and other "local" when almost everything is being manufactured in China regardless? I'm all for some healthy patriotism but nationalistic rhetoric is wack.

Anyway, perhaps I'll be learning a $529 lesson here, or perhaps it'll be close enough to the claimed 18mph/14mile, idk but neither does anyone else commenting..  at the very least, it'll be good for travel, at 158wh - I fly often, and the airline I use most often has a <160 limit. So, ideal.

Many people who buy these boards know nothing about eskates, so they just watch comparisons between the specs claimed. Once they bought it, they probably don't even check what's the real top speed and range. Acton isn't new on the market, and we've seen how poor the first generation was. What makes a brand a "Chinese reseller"? The components they use, even if they're all produced there. Hub motors on alibaba are all crap, batteries are all produced in China, but a Samsung 25R is better than the unspecified 10A cells of these boards, even if they're all Samsung. Chinese boards use poor components, quality boards use known components. Acton use the same components of any other Chinese board. Do your maths.

How do you know these are 10A cells? Afaik that's just speculation at this point?

It seems that the koowheel/e-wheelin i4/carvon emc2/genesis/e-go boards are all of the same general class, and while their given specs differ slightly, there isn't extreme controversy over their performance, which is relatively close to the claimed s2 specs... they all do around 14-19mph and have a range of 8-12 miles and cost approximately the same.. why would acton go out of it's way to destroy their own reputation by offering a product that isn't even on par with these other "brands" which clearly don't allocate much $ to marketing?

Up to 30A means it's 10-15-20 with 30 peak, that's very very low. On esk8s people try to go for 60+. We know because there aren't Li-Ion cells with high discharge rate and those exact mAh on the market, easy. I would say youneec is a bit better than other chinese brands, the other ones are all the same crap. Acton is on par with these other brands, but being on par means being mediocre. The fact is, people buy those same boards on Alibaba knowing they're chinese crap, while these kickstarters try to make them look like new appealing products that they clearly aren't. Don't trust any board with hub motors if you don't know which hubs they're using. If there were good ones out there, we would know. But there aren't yet, except for the ones produced by guys from this community or carvons (and even with carvon, I wouldn't use singles or the prebuilt, that looks like it's not even using a carvon motor)
Edit: those will never get 8-12 miles, more likely 5-7

Ok, sure, so hardcore enthusiasts pouring thousands of dollars into tools and builds shoot for 60A discharge rates, and top of the line setups like the raptor2 have 360 wH capacity... does it stand to reason that a slower discharging battery with roughly half the capacity would have roughly half the range? If the e-go does 14 miles on a charge at 202wh, why is 10 miles so unbelievable on the s2 at 158wh?

Is 10-30A really that terrible? evoheyax stated that he puts out 20-30A on the flats with his build - as flats are going to be 98% of my riding, why should I be shooting for 60A?

Pulling 20-30A on 30A peak cells is bad. They're not supposed to run at peak level normally. 60A is usually what we aim at, but that's not peak, that's nominal. People get away with 40 nominal, but you will kill your cells if you run them at max current constantly. And I'm not a hardware enthusiast, but I'm building a full board for less than 600, with a 270 (or 324, depends if I decide to go with 3000mah per cell) Wh liion 10s3p with 60A nominal, you just have to look for group buys and you can do much better for the same low price

Well, I can tell you that starting with no knowledge at all (I knew nothing about motors, batteries or electronics except for my custom pc build) is really not a problem. You can get everything you need from this forum. Check out @JLabs' group buy, you may still be in time to enter. That's pretty good stuff at a ridiculous price. 
Oh, not to mention that if you break your custom build you can get it back working in a couple minutes/hours/days, while sending a board back to Acton (and you will probably have to do so) may take you weeks if not months

I think at this point, since he doesn't even a working motor yet, we can say how good this board will be. This is his first time with hub motors, and he's assuming everything's going to work off the bat with minor fixes needed. But he's going to have bigger issues with those motors that will push the release back, or he will ignore some problems and ship them anyways, mark my words. I wouldn't say it's top of the line, everything he has always done and said is hype. He's a great business man, but just a decent builder. If your not well informed, you will believe a lot of the lies he says. He's making claims right now, and has sold over 200k USD in boards and doesn't even have a working motor yet, which let me tell you, takes more than 6 months to work out the kinks of.

There's a hand full of us on here who have the experience to see through the BS of his company and many others on the market (especially the china board companies).

In terms of range, like I said before, none of these ranges numbers mean anything. Unless they tell you what weight and the terrain's incline those numbers were gathered with, they mean nothing. A 200 lb person will get half the range of a 100 lb person on the same board a terrain. So you can watch videos on youtube, but they just tell you the boards work. Theres no science. I hope you keep your order and tell us about the range when you get it. I would like to see more real world tests of these china completes.

So have you made your mind on what to do?

I think @deke997 will have some interesting stats to show, as he is planning to use some li ion cells to test his board and different configs, I believe.

His thread is here:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/test-max-battery-amperage/14631/6

I do hope he gets some results and also publishes them.. Im just also curious what happens when you run a board with not so strong batteries..

Nah I'm still unsure what to do, I believe I have until Sunday to cancel (when the indegogo campaign ends)? 

Recently what has really got me thinking is the whole hub motor in-wheel design - I like to pump and slide _hard_, and I'm not a little guy - perhaps belt driven is the way to go with my riding style, or offset hub motors (like the Carvon design). Honestly at this point I'm thinking about just getting on the v2 boosted dual+ list... probably would have already  if they used a stiff directional deck, instead of a vanguard..

The other option I've been considering (aside from just biting the DIY bullet of course) is the benchwheel b2+. Info is pretty sketchy but it's been suggested that this newer version has the 25r Samsun 18650 cells rather than the lower discharge 22p. If I could confirm this (plan on trying to reach out to the manufacturer/importer today) then I could probably justify the $650 cost - worst case I have to buy a couple of vesc's and a new BMS.. maybe some lower kv motors... but at least would have a decent battery pack/enclosure/motor mounts/pullys/wheels and remote control - 2.4 ghz radio vs Bluetooth, which seems to be preferred? Trucks are noted for weak axles but I have a friend who distributes calibers and another who can CBC lathe, so no problem there...

Personally, I think 2.4ghz might be a better option, at least mini remote uses it and so far it has been all okay for me.. I think for some reason bluetooth has more problems / dropped connection than 2.4ghz.. but others are welcome to prove otherwise..

I think nyko kama had dropped connections.. and also 'winning / nano' remote, but for nano, I believe the problems were not with transmission technology but with something else..

---

I dont know for how much boosted is gonna go but if you're okay with what raptor 2 offers (the looks, claims, etc).. I might actually choose raptor 2 over boosted, in case you choose the commerical boards route..

Upgrading (if it is possible) the benchwheel, also sounds okay.. but yeah, do you own research as Im not eying these longboards as much as some mountainboards china offers, though, only 2 models so far and both are pretty sketchy and seem to be unreliable..

In your case (short distance, good turning radius, not big board).. I would look into something like Bolt or keep with the idea on upgrading the existing batteries.. I think there was exactly a thread on how to improve Blink's distance..
