Apparently the units for sale on [alibaba](http://backfireboards.com/https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/2017-New-Backfire-electric-skateboard-dual_60664998526.html) are sample unit which contains no water potting sealant, wheels which are the wrong tolerance because they are from the first 1000 batch and a whole host of other potential issues with battery life, I cannot confirm this but I would stick to buying them from [backfire](http://backfire) 

This[ reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/6nejfx/backfire_ii_galaxy_editioninitial_thoughts/) discussion has some info in it if you are looking for more context

Anyways I'll update this in the future, give me your thoughts of what you think.
