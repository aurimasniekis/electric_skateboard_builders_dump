I'm thinking on setting my eyes on this one. Lots of room for upgrades and mods. You can order the thing with a bunch of different options. The look of this beast is awesome.

FWIW was over at the Bajaboard workshop today. Axle to axle the S2 is exactly the same length as a Trampa MTB, but overall length is shorter due to the inboard motors. It’s lighter, but at over 15kg I still wouldn’t want to carry it. Dragging is fine though, since the front-end is light.

Wait, Freebord bindings? I thought they hated us Esk8ers. I guess everyone has their price...
