They Build board with no brand on boards that are very similar to ownboard, wowgo and meepo, and they are very cheap!. How it's possibile? They are the supplier for any cheap brand? Or it's a scam?
They are on Alibaba

[/quote]

He does make that claim and calls himself the factory outlet.  He also shares private credit card details publicly so no more of this generic crap.
@DerelictRobot  not aimed at you man.
