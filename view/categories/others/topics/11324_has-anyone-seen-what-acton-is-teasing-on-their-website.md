It looks like they're teasing a quad hub motor set-up. Official announcement is on the 20th this week. What do you guys think of it? 

Literally the first picture on their site: http://actonglobal.com/

I feel like I've seen this (or at least very similar) design on Alibaba. No doubt it looks cool! 

On another note, other than because you can, why would you want to drive all 4 hubs at the detriment to the battery? I would rather have a lighter weight (or longer range) option with dual.

@LEVer any chance for a quad version of the cruiser? http://www.carvonskates.com/store/p38/CARVON_E-Cruiser_--_Drop-Through_Dual_Hub_Motors_Electric_Longboard.html 

I think the acton quad will be very similar rebranded thing...at least their design is getting better....

No way they would let out a board that fast...

this is the opposite approach for sure but since those tiny hubs are cheap and the low power escs are too it makes sense for their model....sell 4x perboard

youre being too practical about this...it has lights all the way around, its a "look at me" board...awd. :sunglasses:

[/quote]

So what is the future?

With 4wd, I have torque that accelerates me from 0-20 in under 3 seconds. In a city environment where there's stop signs every 1000 feet, this allows me to travel at the same pace of traffic and still maintain an 18 mph average. On top of that, I have equal traction all around, which makes the board feel more stable. If you haven't tried 4wd, you would have no way of knowing.

Hubs have less moving parts that can break. Literally, the beaings are the only thing that can break in a good hub motor. There's no adjusting alignment, belts breaking, etc. I don't have to do much maintanece ever really.

If you don't use Bluetooth as a builder, how do you know what's going on in your board and make improvements?

And bigger wheels... well that's just personal preference.

What are you innovations? What have you spent time researching and developing?

I'm amazed that they can even offer it this cheap. Wonder how the quality will be. Glad to see someone finally produce 4wd hub motor boards for the market. But I can't imagine they are of any quality at htat price. Decent quality hub motors at factory prices are $400 in bulk, and another $400 for the escs (of questionable quality, over $700 for high quality vescs). And that's before batteries, trucks, and a board.

I can't imagine they are of any decent quality at this price...

the cost goes up so much with the redundancy.  I'd rather get as much power with one or two motors that were bigger.   less things to break.   less weight. 

dont know why but you were showing worse efficiency with the four than two I believe.  could be four low-rebound tires increasing the rolling resistance but other than that it seems it would have to be running four motors vs less.

maybe electric skateboards in general is just a hype and will go over in a few years, like the internet 20years ago, but wait...

I think 90mm+ is great, hubs are legit and dual-drive is the way to go, 4wd is kind of extreme

[/quote]

It is, but certain environments, like San Francisco, need a lot of torque. And I don't want to slow down climbing hills. I go up 7% grade hills at 23-24 mph, so I only lose 2 mph of speed to climb a decently steep hill. And when you have 6 of these kinds of hills back to back... It really pays off 5 miles in 15 minutes in a city is pretty quick, and a lot of that comes down to being able to accelerate quickly and being able to maintain speed while climbing hills.

I want a 4wd board I just don't trust this mfg. I mean their specs list "zero maintenance required" which I'm not sure I believe.

Although maybe they are saying no routine belt tensioning etc which makes sense.  I just assume one of the 4 ESC/motor is going to have some sort of electrical/mech malfunction.

yes, yes and yes. I would love to see how long these really last. Like I said, they have have to be cutting corners somewheres to bring down prices, a 4wd board should never be that cheap to produce...

I also doubt they are running FOC, so they are probably laf (not saying my board isn't cause of my bearings right now, but..)

Calling it "talking shit" is ridiculous, i said they are fads that arent really improvements, just differences. 

Right now on the market there are glorified grocery getters and borderline death wishes. 

For stop, go, and blinkers (i ""innovated"" a really cool blinker system, ill share it in my forthcoming prototype build log), 2.4 ghz all the way. For transmitting realtime data to your phone or other device, bluetooth wins. Im working on my own hybrid remote, amongst other things.

Im quite alone on this forum in thinking that, even with protective gear, its foolishly dangerous to be going over 20mph in a city commuting fashion. Every amp spent going faster than that is sacrificed from a more efficient and higher torque build. Im not sure how steep the hills are on my commute, but ive been blasting up them at 24mph without issue on a single drive with 83mm wheels and 16/36 gearing. Im playing around with 73mm self manufactured "all terrain" wheels for the sake of less amp draw but still getting over bumps and cracks in the sidewalk.

My board is also unique in its construction, Im recessing the motor into the board and to get it higher off the ground to comp for the smaller wheels.

Im also writing up a schematic to individually charge 10 cells individually, since my balance charger and BMS are still not getting everything up to 4.2v. 

I dont consider anything i do innovation

Getting dual hubs from CarvOn is at the very least $500 each, battery pack is at least $400, four ESCs at let's say $125 each, add in an aluminum/CF deck would be about $200. A DIY 4WD would be over $2000 so their retail of $1,700 is not bad I guess.

Although the Acton Qu4tro's $1,100 Indigogo price is tempting, their advertised top speed is only 23mph, which is a bit disappointin. I'm glad I have no hills that my Boosted 2 and DIY (single 6374) can't handle or I would've ordered one. I do like that modern look.

i wonder why they are stalling.  Maybe they're still developing, making sure it wont fall apart.  They all sell little motors and people are going to expect to go up mountains from the videos they show.  If people do the claimed wattage and angles advertised maybe the motor will get too hot and then the rubber will soften and come off.

The dude on reddit said the motor casing is the same as ewheelin because they had to send the molds to China and everyone copied it from there. But the motors inside are completely unique. According o him. Honestly, watching the evolution of the blink board, the improvements they made with the 2nd gen, I think these new boards are gonna be pretty well put together. And the service/support seems better than boosted. Also the companion app is legit. I think as for as entry level low cost pre builts, this is way better than the chinese clones or that genesis the just started shipping. My guess is that acton will be mainstream like boosted in no time. They'll be the ford and Chevy of esk8s.

I like these.  nice looking.  cheap.  I dont want to put them down but putting it in perspective I wont even sell single hub motors because they're too weak and that's all these people are selling.  If youre not expecting speed or power these might fit the bill. 


 6.5 or 5 miles range is their claim but the 72 watt hours it has wont do that (but all the companies hugely exaggerate so no surprise)
15mph max on the regular blink and 10 on the lite version.  Wonder how legit this is given companies claims are exaggerated on this too in my experience.
The grade of hill they claim it can climb I'd have to see to believe.

There are a few reviews on YouTube of the 2nd gen blinkboard with a hub motor. Seems like most people are confirming the speed and range. Also, according to the acton guys, they improved the battery and the ESC in this new blink s. Sounds like it's a slight improvement ver the blinkboard and its $150 cheaper. I cant imagine finding a board like this for any cheaper. It's more like a toy than a vehicle, but for someone on a really tight budget for time and money, this seems like a decent idea.

Oh man. I don't know about those Genesis boards. They barely started shipping like a week ago and it's not looking to good in my opinion. They claim some bonkers stuff on their website, like 20 mile range and they're only getting like 5 out of them. Plus I bunch of problems like once the battery gets down to half, it loses I lot of power. And. If you hit I large enough bumb, the board turns off. And the remote can lose connected while ridding, so you lose your brakes. I'd go with something else in my opinion.

I'm not sure about the range, but I can confirm the top speed on the last-gen Blink (Hub version). 

As for their current product, it was cheap, and based on what I heard about their first belt-driven model, I had very low expectations. To my surprise, it's been working out quite well (pushing around 230+lbs) and I use it almost daily. The hubs and trucks look identical to the e-Wheelin/Paradox board and even their remote looks identical (with the internal switch and everything). I suppose who designed it doesn't matter as much to me, as long as it works. 

Maybe I got lucky, but I was impressed enough to order the S2 and the Qu4tro. In the worst case, I'll have many good rides, something will break, and I'll build something fun out of the remaining parts. Speaking of which, they've recently announced that the S2 gets 2 miles more range than expected (total of 14miles).

The reviews on reddit seem to say that they have drastically lower range, with a decline in top speeds between 6-8 miles (https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/59w3m8/genesis_hellfire_10_day_40_mile_review/). I wouldn't trust the board. 

That being said, I was reluctantly impressed with the Stinger model. The board may be awful, but it seems to hold up well enough in a skateboard (unless they kept feeding Josh Katz a replacement board every 10 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWAQRqG3IPM).

You're not alone @itsmikeholland I practice slow speeds when I'm around any traffic. There are too many unknown variables in city settings, for my comfort level, to exceed 20MPH. I'm cool at 15MPH, I still get there on time.

So i bought the indiegogo Blink S for $369 and i just got it a week ago. The board is quality legit. I'm super happy with it. It fulfills every spec that it states. Top speed, range, hill climb, charging time, water resistance. It seems really well made. I'd say it looks better quality then a boosted. I think acton really polished their boards and that's why they had to virtually rebrand them all together. This is a hug step up from the OG Blink. I'm curious to see how the S2 and Quatro turn out.

I actually just pre-order the qu4dro looking forward to it...hopefully. will make a review when i get it. its suppose to ship on early June :D... BTW if anyone is interested in buying any board from Acton you can use my referral link and get 150 dollar off. ( Yes, i will also get 150 per referral, not trying to scam anyone here.)

I doubt the BLINK QU4TRO will even go to market in the current form, looks like they have some patent infringement hurdles to overcome from stealing the suspension idea from another company..I wonder if Avenue trucks knows about this thing yet, looks like a local company to them too...wow

Yeah no, they are not, talked to Avenue already, there's an interesting backstory, but yeah, no, they are not working together on it..

Not after January the 1st. Longhaired dude pockets will be empty by then, he just warn me a few days ago. Little weasel is raising the price on them Witchblades. He want me to get one before Jesus Christ birthday.

Suspension

I suspect the suspension system will polarize a lot of people. The main problem here is physics.

Here's the thing. Currently, the way a regular TKP (traditional kingpin) or RKP (reverse kingpin) truck is set up, there's a pivot cup and a kingpin that forces the truck to only rotate in a sort of semi-circular fashion in one plane around the pivot point. In other words, the truck rotates around the axis determined by the pivot point and the kingpin keeps it in place. However, with Acton's suspension trucks, in addition to the regular RKP single plane rotation, the suspension is further allowed to deform in infinite directions due to the nature of the design. See my beautifully drawn graphic for an example of what I mean:

Keep in mind that in a traditional suspension, you only want yourself to be suspended along one axis. If you need to be suspended along more than one axis, you add more distinct axis along which to be suspended. You almost never want yourself to be suspended in all possible axis, because then you're really just jiggling around. That's what's happened with the suspension on the Qu4tro: You're really just... jiggling, which prevents you from properly turning or carving with confidence at any reasonable speed. The suspension will deform and neutralize the majority of your turn. It's honestly not great, and the default hard bushing Acton includes doesn't make it any better.

Edit: Avenue, the makers of the original suspension trucks, have informed me that they have in no way licensed their suspension trucks for Acton, nor are they working with Acton on suspension trucks. Here is their statement:

"In my opinion Acton’s suspension has many flaws in its design, much so that I wouldn’t step on it for possibility of failure. We have warned them about the implications of their design as they skipped what we found to be ‘very necessary processes to ensure the integrity of the baseplate’  Yet they chose to ignore us and run with their design anyways as they obviously wanted to go around our patents as 'best they could’, or so they thought. Sounds like your Quatro 4 test confirmed many of my suspicions regarding their flaws to be true. Ultimately I’d hate to see someones Acton suspension system break and fail at top speed on a board in traffic resulting in injury or worse.. simply because Acton didn’t want to license our design properly."

I'd originally written a review on Avenue TKP suspension trucks modded onto my Carbon GT and quite enjoyed it, so please do not let this review scare you away from suspension trucks!
