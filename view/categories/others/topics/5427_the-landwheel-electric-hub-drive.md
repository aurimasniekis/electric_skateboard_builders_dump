hi guys

i needed a solid waterproof board for the rainy commute. i realy wanted it to be small and light power was not much of a deal . i was thinking about mellow but it was waaayyyy to expensive . so i dropt the bom on this product . thinking about mounting this under a nickelboard or chop down a regular skateboard.

it will come in mid-end of july . there is a german seller that sells this as well as the lofty ambition boards. 

does anyone have experience with this electrick drive ?

@daanstoorvogel keep us posted, I'm sure many of us would like to know what your experience is once it's all set up. If the specs are as stated, and it is durable enough to endure a few years or riding, it could be awesome. While not a DIY kit, I think it's cool that there could be a way to get a setup like this for a decent price.

With videos about e-skates and... water technology?
I don't know how that happened but it looks like the guy is located in Munich

yeah i know pretty weird combo , but the guy got to make money some way haha, he has a video on a simular drive but thats the ONAN drive . that one is floating all over alibaba  but ik has way less power than the orange one

How can you ever get a range of 12-15 km with 60 Wh ?? I can't even get 10 km with my 6s 5000mah = 120Wh battery

i know , pretty sceptical. hubs are pretty efficient but still... i looked it up an alibaba and the specs are all over the place. nobodys has the same specs 24 volt 36 volt  top speed 25 to 45 kmph . so just hoping for an good outcome . otherwise gonna be preety creative with 18650s or lipos

## \#9 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2016-07-01T19:25:42.610Z Reads: 951

```
by going very slow i would imagine. This thing only has 6 cells in it, probably 3000-3100 mah cells based on the specs. 67.2Wh is odd. And that's a big box for such low power, i feel like they could have gone a bit smaller.

Hubs are not more efficient than belt drive if I'm correct , And i have a single drive, this one has dual hub motors ... 

Really curious what the performance of the board will be, 
Maybe you have to carry 5 extra batteries with you :)

```
Everytime any company puts range numbers they find horse jockeys to ride the distance attempt laying flat.  They get so low and reduce the wind resistance so much they get better range going faster..as close to max speed as possible. Someone somewhere on the web explains it all but I don't remember and you'll have to search.

I think a hub motor could be more efficient if it's the right kv   Low

I am really interested in these as well, I saw them on Instagram and have contacted them and can get one for a real good price, just don't want to be the guniea pig and have no money for my build. I got some different specs to the other website (I've only been on landwheels) I asked for the kv rating of the motors but all I got was this...<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0829c4189c60446091f5b88b938f49c708928b5f.png" width="281" height="500">

Hello guys, I am new to this board and new to e-boarding in general, but my research on Alibaba also led me to this landwheel drive system. I also had some nice chat with the people involved. I'm yet to buy my first eboard, b/c frankly I'm to clumsy to build one myself and this seems like a good, affordable option. I think they priced it at 350$ (400 with board) last time I asked, which really seems like a competitive price.

@daanstoorvogel, hey thx man, yea, the video is a bit lame, I asked them to show it off a bit more, I want to see it at full speed with some nice turns, also I am concerned about customs, I think their battery lacks certification. I live in EU and I dont want customs to confiscate the board or pay extra fees. My budget is tight for these things.

I was a bit concerned about the range too, but the freewheeling kinda settles it. Btw is this a common feature of hub motors that you can push them like a normal skateboard?

Another thing is that the motors could be noisy, I found this vid where you can actually hear them run, what do you think?

I would say it would sound different with weight on it?? And if you are concerned about the range just get another battery. That's the whole idea of that design.

I really like the waterproof, if it keeps its promise. I mean I wouldnt ride it in rain intentionally, for my own savety, but here in Austria we have many moist days where I wouldnt risk to ride a board without that feature, motor damage would be inevitable, also it should give me a much more relaxed ride if I dont get the panic from every puddle of water.

7s15c  . Kind off weird but with the right kv and mah  should be still fine though? Or is that not possible . I've been checking up on them and it seems that they are useing  a chipset  wich  is common for hoover boards.. the taotao system as she calles  it. Tried to talk some vesc sense into te guys . But my guess it will be to expensive.  But then again I prefer an hobby grade esc over Thier system . Can't really judge I don't know the taotao that well  . Anyone ?

I met the ONAN sales/engineer team at a recent Vegas convention and their newer model is coming with bigger wheels and it's seemed super promising for. beginner buy.  It's much cooler than the toy blink boards and other models out there. :) Price was a little expensive but I'm going to try it and sell my x1 to a buddy.

ooo that would be awesome. But honestly until I loose weight or get a bigger battery setup/motors my X1 battery can't pushme more than 10 minutes or  5-6 miles which ever comes first depending in hills. I'm past their limitst like 80lbs over their Wight limit lol. :) Or more. I appreciate the offer. :) Once I make my own board with some good size batteries and good motors I'll be able to ride.lomger that or I lose this belly i got. Lol ;)

I tried the Onan 2WD (X1?)
it drives really good. (regarding the price)
I go to France testing several boards then I will know more.
they told me to make a bigger motor and do some protection circuit on the board. (mine died after 5 min, whils I was still in China, so they sdnt a replacement, which I have now)
their support us good.



the Landwheel I can not say, because I didn't drive it. 
they said to reengineer their electronics. they found some issues and need to change that.
I respect their descision, otherwise we all would get broken boards. 

as I said to Rex in another thread: 
THEY DO NOT PROPERLY TEST THEIR BOARDS

I couldve gotten it for a good price when they did their presale, but what I really wanted was a complete board where everything is screwed together nice and solid and with enough range. 12-15km just doesnt do it for me and replacing batteries on the fly and always having to recharge two...nah, really dont need that extra work.

So i received mine and this SOB is FAST! Holy hell it almost scared me the first few times riding it. 
Unfortunately it somehow shorted out and won't run now. Somehow it created burn marks on two of the battery leads and board leads. They said they would ship me another  drive mechanism shortly. Regardless, this thing is my all time favorite stock toy. 29 volts i think too.

well I got an answer from Mellow in german. Allegedly they are observing the competition very closely. They claim they have tested the Landwheel system and found that it doesn't keep its promises. They go on saying that they already had a couple of comments on facebook saying that the quality would more compare to a "toy for kids". Now where have I heard that before lol. Sounds like they are already in desperation mode.

I just had a back and forth Whatsapp conversation with the woman who manages their sales.

She said it's $799 (shipping included) for one unit. I told her I have 5 colleagues that are interested in either DIYing or buying their product, she quoted me $379 + $73 freight charge. So basically group buy of roughly $450 each. She mentioned tax, not sure how that's paid. I told her it's too expensive for an unproven drive system. I would've gotten gotten it if it wasn't for that shipping cost....and having to buy 5 and hope it's good enough to recommend to my colleagues and get my money back thru them!

Can someone provide me insight on the lipo vs Samsung lithium ion difference as far as which is best used for a non diyer/ retail consumer. To me units with Lipo's aren't really retail consumer friendly due to the lipos needing extra attention when charging, not being completely discharged to avoid being damaged, Right?  Educate me please. :) I know my buddy who handles tons of Lipo's in his RC cars says unless your a DIY'er which most of you are here then this unit is not suited for the average Non- Diyer.... anyone agree to that?

THanks, read them and I think to my point the landwheel is using Lipo and without knowing how to properly charge/discharge these the average consumer is gonna go through battery packs like crazy. For the DIYer this could be a quick alternative and cheap to getting a fast esk8 unit so thats cool... but man I can imagine the returns due to battery packs going bad.  What do you all think?
Am I being to negative nancy...?

Sorry misunderstood, yes the boards protected on the new models from what I saw on the X1. Must have been early prototype that BBQ870 tried. Mine has been put through rigorous testing...like i said, i'm a big boy 6'2 320lbs and it works for me :)  If it were going to short out, it would have happened already and I've been riding it hard, scraping the battery back a bit and the trucks.

got mine yesterday. Broke after 10 minutes. One hub motor failed and barely turns. Because of that it shuts down the drive. 

Although the short ride I had, I totally liked, it was smooth and very quiet. The acceleration is pretty fast. I can compare only with a single motor that already have.

Mine too! One of the motor's cable melted 10 minutes in my first ride.

I gotta say, I own the Ewheelin i4 (which after 2 rides doesn't charge anymore, I'm waiting on a replacement), the Onan x1 (which so far is holding up pretty good!) the landwheel is by far the fastest, I could never tap the full potential of it since I had it installed on a 29' board but yeah... 10 minutes in it cut out and i smelled burnt plastic, <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c6351bedd3005a8f12b5f8172f6811b78a46923b.JPG" width="375" height="500"> now it doesn't turn on.

I agree with @cantstopme about Landwheel people not being bad people. From my conversations with them, they are normal people trying to make a honest dollar with a business, a for profit business which is totally understandable.

What they are, are not skaters, There are sales people, designers and engineers, but they don't seem to have anyone there who actually skates and USE their product for it's intended purpose. Rolling down a small street barely able to balance and turn is not a true test of your products potential. Melting wires covers would've been noticed by any riders on this forum in one riding session.

them being bad riders is no excuse tho. surely they had other options to test their unit under stress in their factory. They need to learn to pace themselves and double check everything and every unit before release. They lack, what the Germans are known for and almost have too much of: thoroughness. And that almost always results in a waste of energy and resources.

No need to say "I told you so" or as @bbq870 said "wake up dude". Some dumba$$ is going to have to test these out, I guess I'm that guy. I already put together an awesome DIY and have a Boosted 2. I got this as an extra for friends with no board.

Anyway, I don't have time for a real long ride so I've only tested it a few blocks. Hub motors are quiet and smooth as you all know, there's no problem with that. Batteries haven't caught on fire yet. And the board seems to have good torque, smooth acceleration and braking.

Remote might be put together wrong as the forward/reverse switch is illogically flipped where the forward position in front is actually reverse?!

These pictures shows the two issue I have AT THE MOMENT, I'm in contact with Eileen at Landwheel to see what can be done. There are burn marks on the battery that weren't there before. I noticed a screw "missing" after the ride, turns out it was actually broken off!

"Why should we avoid sparks ? to avoid damage to UAV's battery connectors (gold plated contact areas are damaged by repeated sparks, the plastic of the connectors will be burned, etc). Some sensitive electrical circuits do not like short bursts of high currents. For example, from experience, an attopilot (voltage and current sensor) circuit has been damaged by repeated sparks using a 6S battery...."

But maybe it's just the design of the contacts .... but since the battery is clipped in...there will always be some type of movement at the connectors 

What's the connectors on the boards? Are they like protruding nubs? Flat as well?

@hummie do you have a click pen, It's maybe a TINY bit stiffer than that.

@Sean555 they definitely made and improvement on the revised one I got as far as those connectors, yours seem to be ill fitted? or did you mess with it?

@daanstoorvogel Mine was shipped out last Friday and I got it on Monday via UPS. I think custom did open it since the box was cut open AFTER the shipping sticker was placed. It was from Hong Kong to California. Who was your sales person? I got mine through Eileen (who also used to sell Vape contraptions and Self Balance boards...scary). I'm talking to her via Whatsapp about my issues. She's pretty responsive so far

I recorded this video last night because Eileen wanted something to show their engineers in regards to the problem I have with this system. Sorry about the mumbling as I've got a cold at the moment. The drive wheels are making a clicky noise as it rolls. I think it might be because their wheels are too soft and it's being compressed when I get on it, making a squeegee kinda noise? There is no noise when there's no added weight.

The units looked new, but they are all technically refurbished. They "fixed" their unshipped units after that melting wire and battery shorting issue in the 1st batch.

My experience is that this could be great, but was rushed to consumer's hands. The acceleration is great and the braking is gentle. My default Vesc setting tried to kill me. I told thme my height and weight and they said no one there is that big. The dual hub motors can handle my 206ish lbs. The problem might be the wheel being too soft

Maybe I just have more compassion than you when it comes to this. I already have two good working boards so unlike many, this is not my primary ride. so I have less urgency, thus I don't get angry.

Starting a business is not easy. Rip off of Mellow or not, these people made an impressive product that can be useful once these problems are worked out.

As far as me "protecting" them. It's not about protecting. It is respecting a company and basically being a beta tester, unlike you I knew the risk when I paid (plus I'm lucky to have a well paying job). Not everyone is comfortable with a full DIY. Boosted's first board was just like some of our member's boards. Everyone has to start somewhere.

It may be slightly different but the load on the motors could slightly outweigh the magnetic force allowing for your coils to grind against it. With the problem that I had it would grind sometimes and not others, so yours could simply be less out of place compared to the hub I worked with. Looking at how this land wheel thing has worked out so far I'd be willing to bet the problem is simply cheap epoxy

good to know it might be a simple fix. the sound is coming from both units (maybe all four motors?) That's crazy % of failure then.

Also if it's cheap epoxy, then would all the magnets eventually fall off as well with the vibration?

Eileen (sales person) is forwarding my video/s and issue to her boss and their R&D people. She told me that their European customers are still waiting for their units due to customs. She wants to see what everyone else's issues are as well.

I was told not to worry and that I will be getting replacements once solutions are found. I have to agree with her that there's no point in sending a replacement that will probably have the same problems. Time will tell if they are going to stand behind their warranty.

What is odd is that they are not asking me to just send them back my faulty units so they can use it to figure out the sources of failures. They just need to get a 125lbs person, and somehow suit him up with 80lbs and they can replicate my issues perfectly.

They finally replied to me as well and said they are looking into it.  I think they tested the boards without a rider. I had someone very light try it and it still did the same thing as mikenoplos said .

They didn't once request for me to return mine. I think they are really confused at what's happening to their product because they really though it was a premium drive system. Last night I got a message from Eileen to spray lubricant between the wheel and the hub motor as it might be ride of the clicking noise according to another costumer! At least she's the sales person and not the engineer there.

Proper thing to do would be to take back a few failed/failing drives and find out where the problem lies. I am being promised replacements once they have a solution, but I have no idea where they are in terms of finding a solution.

I haven't. I don't want to give them a reason to void their one year warranty. They really need to invest in better material. the plastic cover over the electronic in the base cracked, I assume it's from road vibrations. I have two units and they are both like that.

From landwheel contact today 

The problem which make the board can not use normally, we decide to change another circuit, we will use the Taotao Circuit then, I don't know whether you know Taotao, Taotao Technology is a famous skateboard circuit manufacturer, which has good reputation on Scooter and skateboard.

But Taotao Circuit is not ready now, it will ready next month, and when we use it, we need to test it, and a test at least need 1 month then, so the next shipping time is around end of December, I know this date is a little late, but a normal period also need.

Hopefully this fix is legit.

Eileen can promise all day and night. But realistically she's only relaying information from other people at LW. I rather them spend more time testing the durability of the 3rd batch instead of rushing them into production again. I feel really bad for her because she genuinely thought she was selling a great product.

What weatherproofing, there are no o-rings anywhere. I think the motor is probably water resistant, but the main until is just plastic and screws. I would not ride it in puddles.

Hi guys,

Just came across this thread and wish I had found it earlier. I myself bought a sample landwheel L3-A around September, had similar problems as mentioned, then after many delays received the updated version a few days ago. It is definitely a major improvement, seeing as it is smaller, the wiring seems better. At first use it seemed fine. But it suddenly started turning off randomly and is really dodgy when going fast. 

Personally I do believe they are telling the truth and find it such a shame that they haven't sorted out this issues. I myself have been dealing with China for many years and I find that this is one of the few companies from Alibaba which are trying to be a proper brand and are honest guys trying to create a quality product. 

As far as I am aware this product is pretty unique with only the Onan X1/X2, the mellow drive and the Eon being out there. Personally I wanted to support Landwheel over  the Onan.  To me it seemed that even the smallest touches made me feel like they were trying to create something of quality. But I am really frustrated how they couldn't fix their previous problems. I know this thread is for landwheel but what do you guys think of the Onan X2. When the X1 was out I wanted to support Landwheel, but I just found out about the X2 and it does seem really good...Can they be trusted?

Michael

I personally think it's their testing methods and who tests them....

I doubt very highly they have guys close to 200lbs testing... maybe 150lbs at the most soaking wet

And def not enough real world 🌎 useage .... not everyone has nice plazas to ride around or factory floors or parking lots...of course QC isn't up to snuff....

I'm sure they are trying to make a good product but their engineers don't seem to be sk8ers and seem out of touch with the stresses that are put on electronics when placed on a piece wood or carbon fiber riding on wheels that don't absorb any shocks and vibrations.

They need to go back to the design stage and resolve their common issues

I got a question to the ones here who knows battery safety...How should we handle this LiPo battery pack now that the board is pretty much dead and we are sitting around waiting for potential replacements? Obviously not going to be using it now that the thing is dead. 

Do I charge up the battery every 30 days, stick it in the drive and run it with no load (my drive works except the battery disconnect after a little vibration)  to drain it a little so it's not stored at 100%?

HOW should I store the battery? should I put it in an ammo box?

I think the new battery connection has more "surface" connection than before, hence better connectivity, meaning being able to take a bigger power load. Same for the taotao pcb, since it's meant to be of a higher quality I guess it'll handle power better than the previous one. 

One thing is that they added an extra metal cylinder over the motor which concerns me because it is slick, so the PU wheel might spin.

So not only will the old broken drives I have be worthless, so will the two batteries? I agree the battery needs a new design, but it would have been cool to have a few extra batteries. Hopefully there will be a way to modify them to fit the new design.

I decided to try the Onan X2 for that reason which I just got today. I haven't ridden it yet but what frustrates me is Landwheel are doing everything right aesthetically and their products have so much more potential. But of course what matters at the end of the day is how they ride...or well if they actually work haha.

Hi guys, believe it or not my second unit turned to km with a charger, the second test turned to other 13/14 km at speeds in excess of plain 35 km/h.
Now the connectors were crushed inside then get little energy but nothing burned.
I must say that for what I tested the drive isn't bad indeed the driving feel is truly pleasant and enjoyable. Sorry my English
I think a thicker wheel can be better

I bought the first landwheel in July, the first one went short now this is the second version
In my opinion these engines have a great potential
I was lucky enough to test the second drive in a good way
With modifications I think you can get a good product 
My second drive for now does not work you have advice on repair this connector?
As far as driven I repeat it is an excellent engine I have exceeded the speed of 35km/h 
For how I see it not all decks are good to assemble these engines
Battery Plate Flex Curtains
I have built this dedicated deck out before doing the second Test

to make it clear:
Landwheel is NOT TESTING ANYTHING!!!
they don´t know how to do that. step on the board, turn it on, go 20 seconds, turn it off. thats their testing.
you can wait 10 more revisions, there still will be issues.

you can take any part from this skateboard. ANY!! its too weak, wrong material, wrong dimension....
they don´t know what they are doing.

dude, I live in China. all my comments are based on 1st person experience.
I am in design/development over 15 years. I deal with this on a daily base. (in fareast)

Landwheel told me they have superior parts inside, best quality yada, yada, yada.
serious? melting battery terminal? if I was a "normal user" I would call that a blatant lie. but as I have some experience with Cn suppliers, I don´t believe everything.

and yes, I have a board. one? no, multiple.
since months I just hear b****sht from them. honestly, I think they don´t know what they are doing.
my humble opinion: Landwheel is worse than the "standart"chinese supplier.
after multiple attempts, they still lie to me. that is un-acceptable.

my litte story: early 2016 they told me to get one sample in July before going back to Europe. 
I had to rebook my flight 3 times, because: no board, no communication, misinformation,...broken electronics...
and all this after months of back and forth by email, and telephone.

if you want to import these "toys" you must be patient with them. good luck for you!!
not me (any more)

rough night? yes, but that involved too much sangria ; ) 
not e-boards

ps: next time I go back to Europe, I will bring 2 landwheel, 1 onan and many other parts. (half of them is broken)
and sell them for 1€ on ebay

Southern California here. I ride a Boosted 2 (until that battery issue came up) and an awesome DIY. The Boosted is comfortable because of the flex, and the DIY is good for long distance when I actually want to get somewhere further than 3 miles from the house.

I bought the LW because I want to just keep a board at the office to run out for lunch. I liked the idea of just slapping it on any deck as I have three decks just sitting there these days.

EDIT. Just looked further into the FedEx detail, looks like it's coming from Monterey Park, CA which is an hour drive from me. That is a predominately Chinese community (I would know since I used to live there in my elementary school days). I guess shipping is cheaper that way.

weird. I just got a FEDEX tracking number and it say shipping label has been created and the scheduled delivery will be TODAY? I'm assuming that's an error.

Mine is showing the same "label created" , arriving in Monterey Park CA (supposed yesterday) and set to arrive in Detroit MI by end of the week ...  but my other recent china orders were similar and that wasn't accurate .  i ordered an i-wonder board and it showed this and was about a week later before it hit CA and began tracking out to me.

hopefully we'll get ours soon,  looking forward to testing these out (the i-wonder SK-A3 has ok power but the control is terrible btw... it's too bad because build quality and swappable battery is really nice )

I bought an Onan and it was faster and better at maneuvering. But it was heavier, bigger and the better maneuvering made it seem quite unstable and unsafe at times. Most importantly they are less of a brand I find and from my experience much worse customer support. Landwheel may have messed up but they offered straight away to send us new ones without the need to return. Onan expected me to fix it myself, with instructions, but I am no engineer. They sent me a new motherboard. Then it still did not work. Of course haven't heard back from them (I know it is Chinese New Year, but they had time to reply before hand).

I have had the label created too and has been for a while. From my experience this is just UPS and with DHL I didn't have the problem. Once it is "picked up" then it comes pretty quickly. I bought the smaller i-Wonder. I was considering buying ones like this before, but I bought just one and re-sold it as I didn't like the control either. The build quality and reliability did surprise me but the remote is basic and the acceleration is quite sudden.

This happened to my last order (just not for as long). The strange thing is that if I call UPS they say that it hasn't left its original place - Netherlands...Even though it is in fact China. I have a feeling that they send them out to the main depot place for that area or continent (Europe being Netherlands I guess). I have a feeling that UPS are holding it as they haven't paid the duty but the are on holiday which is why Landwheel haven't got back to them. 

Just a theory. But either way, they are back on the 7th of February

Mine just arrived at the office today. Charged up the battery and then recorded the video below.

TWO issues right off the bat, the forward and reverse switch on the remote is still wrong, one would assume if the arrow point towards the front it's forward. Someone there lacks logic. I mentioned this to them last time, guess it's not important enough to correct.

The polyurethane wheel is not perfectly round. I'm not sure how much this will affect the ride or if it will correct itself after a bit of wear...one has to wonder if this revision would even last long enough for that.

Rode mine today and so far so good. Only used slow mode though. My blind faith in this design was shattered when the last one locked up on me at damn near full speed, and of course tarded me wasn't wearing a helmet. 
The braking seems a little sensitive so be careful not to launch yourself off the front. 
Too bad we can't re-purpose the old batteries. Feels like a waste. Any idea if the hub design is substantially different from the first two iterations precludeing a swap of one shits the bed? I would love to be able to do something with the two defective drives sitting in my garage. This thing definitely blows my benchwheel board out of the proverbial water though. Needs an endurance and heavy load test. Anyone else received and ridden theirs?

Considering the connections are now very different, the old batteries will require some modifications. If anyone figures out how to make that work, the beer is on me. I got one of the hubs working on the previous drive so I made a setup for my 8 yr old son that accelerates a lot slower. This latest design, while being A LOT louder than the others, seems pretty solid so far. The loud noise  almost sounds like grinding, so I hope it's not slowly destroying itself.

the previous model's wheels shouldn't fit. The new ones are designed differently when a metal sleeve.

I didn't notice the uneven wheels with my short ride. Did anyone notice the "wrong" forward and backwards button on their remote? LW actually reads these posts and told me "Our engineer told me you installed in opposite way".

I know that the motors should be in the rear, and that the battery part should face forward. I have no idea what LW expects me to do...make this a front wheel drive?

Very powerful and fast. great.
but brake must be careful.

Slightly noisy on start spinning, When the speed comes out, I don't hear any more.

There is no problem if you get used to the forward / reverse switch on the remote is still wrong.
Apart from that, It's hard to use that the forward / reverse switch, and mode change switch is much smaller.

understandable that you paid for two batteries. But so far they have been pretty good in terms replacing their faulty products (twice now for some people). They are trying to get every customer something to ride on ASAP, as long as they promise to send us the "accessories" we should just have fun with what we got I guess.

#4 would be the only way that the board will go forward with the switch in the front position. I think that's what they want me to do.

NOTE: I don't want an exchange or fix on mine. I merely wanted to help them, yet their responses are basically "we did nothing wrong, you put it on wrong". Am I the only one laughing at this?

1 = Rear wheel drive (the preferred setup)
2 = Front wheel drive (loses traction due to lighter pressure over from end)
3 = Possible what they asked me to do?
4 = The ONLY way to have the remote switch in the correct direction, the drive in the rear and going forward.

Considering the fact that a lot of my weight is in the back and turning is also from the back the drive train should be in the back as well. I will open up the remote and see what I can do. as for the phase wires swapping. I rather not do it on this since there's very little space to work with. I wish it was as simple as just pulling out two bullet connectors and switching it. Building your own board definitely makes it easier.

I can run it fine by it self but as soon as i turn the board over and stand on it starts beeping and then nothing .... has anyone else experienced this?  

I have a spare battery for this one and i tried that one too (both charged fully) .. i'll have to give the other one a try and see if i just got a faulty one.

Eileen (and Landwheel) is excellent with their communications and willingness to perfect this product...even if they are not skaters.

you say it's powerful.  I wonder how powerful as I forget what batteries it has but they are li-ion and few.  The root of my wondering is what amps does the esc allow.  Is it pulling more amps than what the cells are rated for?  Maybe a simple speed test against a diy board that has a watt meter.   Generally people need to put a lot of li-ion cells in parallel and also series to reduce the amp draw on individual cells.  Maybe it has magic in the board.

It is a hub motor which usually means you need higher battery currents because you can't compensate with gearing.
It can all be fine as long as you don't push the board's limits too hard (like long hills at full speed).
The cables will get warmer compared to thicker ones though.

Having taken apart the broken drives and experimented on them, I think I can answer a number of the questions that have been asked so far in this forum.

Several have complained that the reverse switch on the remote is backwards.  I think that the position of the switch is supposed to indicate where the wheels are positioned.  So the backward position of the remote means the wheels are on the rear of the skateboard.  If you think that the position of the switch is forward/reverse, then you will feel that the switch is backwards.  To me it seems backwards as a forward/reverse switch. But to the people who designed it, I think they feel the switch is correct because the switch shows where the drive wheels are located.  

Anyway, if you want to make the reverse switch function the opposite way then there are two easy ways to do this.  The simplest is to flip the wheels on to opposite sides.  Just disassemble the trucks and bushings, then remove both wheels from the axle and reverse them.  Now both motors will push in the opposite direction as they did before the modification.  In order to do this you will need to completely disassemble the trucks and remove the trucks from the base.  That is the only way to get enough slack in the wires to be able to remove the motor from the axle.

The second way to change direction is to remove the plastic plate that covers the electronics and switch the motor wires from the left side to the right side and vice versa.  This means disconnecting the connectors for the three large gauge wires from the left and swapping them to the corresponding color connector on the right.  Be careful not to mix colors.  As I recall, blue goes to blue, red goes to yellow and black goes to green.  Something like that. It also means swapping the five wire speed sensor connectors.    This is much harder because the wheel speed sensor connectors are wrapped up in heat shrink and the white connector inside the heat shrink is glued. It needs to be cut apart, re-glued and re-shrink wrapped.  Therefore, reversing the wheels is the much easier and much more fool proof method.

Since we focus on product before and the Spring Festival holiday, we didn’t reply your questions on time, I read many questions here now, below are answers for your reference:
 1). The remote direction switch: we adopted your suggestions, and will repair this bug in the subsequent mass production.
 2) The PU wheels are non-circular: the gap of PU wheel metallic in-wall and the motor wall is a little large, resulting in misalignment. We are making efforts to adjust the gap from 0.12mm to 0.05mm. Btw, our supplier didn’t provide enough PU wheels timely before our Spring Festival, the spare PU wheels will be shipped later .
(3) A part of the skateboards are not be able to use when it’s loaded: some employees do not carefully when they assembled the motor, which lead to the truck squeeze the Hall line. The Hall line problems will cause the system alarm, so the drive can not work. We will pay much attention on the production process to ensure that and ensure there is no problem in mass production.

Hi "Landwheel::

I was interested to hear your discussion of the Hall sensor problem.  I was doing some testing on three of my broken landwheel V2 drives.  I made the following observations:

1) All three had one malfunctioning motor.  The windings had electrical continuity so I assumed that the fault was with either a controller that is internal to the motor or with the hall sensor.

2) If I removed the broken motor, the landwheel would no longer "system error" and the remaining wheel would function with the remote.  I was able to fix one of the units by scavenging a working motor from one of the three broken drives.  

3) Another unit could not be fixed on one side because the Circuit Board was damaged.  It could not power a known-to-be-functioning land wheel motor but it could power a sensorless motor from another manufacturer.  This tells me that the broken motor damaged the speed sensor circuitry on one side of the circuit board.

So all three of these observations are consistent with your explanation that the Hall sensor circuit is failing or short circuiting in the hub motors.

However, I am not 100% certain that you have identified the cause.  I bought 6 land wheels.  They seemed to work fine for my 100 pound son.  However, as soon as I tried to ride one of the boards, they board broke instantly. Five out of six broke within seconds of me trying to ride it.  I weigh 210 pounds.  Each of the broken boards had the same problem.  One motor functioned.  The other did not.  It was always the motor that sits below the land wheel logo on the battery.  Its the same side of the board that I tend to put more weight because that's where my heels go.  

The fact that the motors all failed on the same side could just be a coincidence.  

However, I don't think the rider weight is a coincidences.  If I was the first to ride a board, it failed instantly.  If my son was the first to ride the board, it would function until I tried it -- and then it would break instantly.

So I would not be too quick to blame the problem on people assembling the motors incorrectly.  As far as I can tell the failures are related to the weight of the rider.  It could be the weight of the rider crushing the wires (less likely).  It might also be an overload when the motors are trying to accelerate from a stand still.  If I were to guess, I would more strongly suspect that the Hall sensor is damaged when a heavy rider attempts to accelerate.  It may in fact be the ESC that is not effective at accelerating a heavy load.  The ESC may be sending a strong current through the small guage sensor circuit wires.  A strong current through these small gauge wires may be melting the wires or the sensor.  If you take apart a failed motor, you might not be able to tell the difference between a short circuit that melted the wires or a melt down caused by excessive current.  I don't have a V3 yet.  So all of my observations and speculation is based on the V2. 

Like others in the forum, I'm just trying to help.  I am suggesting that you take a much closer look at why the wires leading to the hall sensors are failing.  I also suggest you test the units with much heavier riders on much rougher roads.  Mikenopolis made a similar suggestion.

One more thing.  When I first received my 6 land wheels I noticed that two of the PU wheels were out of round.  I measured thicknesses with a vernier caliper and sent pictures to Eileen.  The difference in wall thickness was out by 2 mm. I was able to swap in spare wheels that were not out of round.  So I'm not sure if the loose wheels that you wrote about is a new problem.  But at one point, it appeared that the mold for the PU wheels had at least one out of round mold cavity.  For example there may be 12 cavities in a mold, at least one of those cavities appeared to be out of round.  So please have you wheel manufacturer take a closer look at each mold cavity.  Also, please take a vernier caliper to many wheels to measure consistency.  


Thanks  Paul

Hi Mike:

Very interested in your comparison of Landwheel to boosted board.  Are you comparing the LW V2 or LW V3?

I also have a boosted board (which by the way is 44.4 volts). A light rider like my son (100 pounds) could out accelerate the boosted board if I was on the boosted board as a 210 pound rider.  However, the landwheel advantage disappeared if his friend rode the land wheel.  His friend is about 120 pounds.  As for my 210 pound weight,  as I mentioned in an earlier post, the V2 Landwheels just fry immediately when I try to ride them.

For fun, I tried wiring up the land wheel base unit to two 6355 260 KV motors.  For my son, the board takes off like a rocket.  That's just an indoor test because the roads are covered with snow and salt.  I took the hybrid 6355-Land wheel to a parking garage.  There was no problem frying motors but I was running the motors with sensors disconnected.  However, the acceleration and top speed  were poor compared to boosted board.  I suppose that's not surprising given that one is running on 44.4 volts vs 24 volts.

If you don't mind sharing, I am curious how heavy of a rider you are.  Have you tested the V3 36 volt LW.  Do you think 36 volts is enough or do you think that LW really needs to look at a 44 volt or 12s configuration in order to satisfy heavier riders.  I'm wondering if they should consider having a 36 volt model for light riders and an auxiliary battery that heavier riders could purchase to boost the system up to 44 volts or higher.  Either a replacement battery or a secondary battery that installs just in front of the LW and plugs in to the LW base.  Those are my ideas.

What are your thoughts?

Hi guys v2 and v3 when your board is trucks up and you accelerate . The board works  but if I grab one wheel it start scratching and the wheel stops . The drive still drives but somewhat close to a differential it seems to disengage this wheel .. is still has a bit of power ( pinching 2 fingers should hold it )  but it makes an awfull  noise and I wonder wat breaking force will do to the wheels . I know there is no weight on te board when tested this . But mine does not function with me on it  I have a version 3 with the beeping alarm problem . Could the sound be a hall sensor that is scratching?

As mentioned in my earlier post,  I tested three broken land wheels and found that in each case the motor that sits below the landwheel battery logo was broken.  Some made a loud noise when turned by hand.  Others did not make a loud noise but when activating the remote wheels up, one the undamaged motor would turn and the damaged motor would not.  Wheels down, the Land wheel would power down within seconds of using the remote.

A replacement motor might correct the problem assuming the motor that is broken has not damaged one side of the circuit board.  If you want to have a bit of fun while you wait for a replacement LW then I believe you might be able to convert the landwheel into a single wheel drive board.  I tested this wheels up.  I did not test it wheels down so I cannot be certain if this would work.

If you want to try this you would have to remove the panel below the battery and you would have to disconnect the three wires that are connected to the broken wheel.  All wires should be taped or shrink wrapped to prevent a short circuit  If the broken motor is on the right, then you need to disconnect the wires that are on the left. In other words, the wires cross over like the human brain.  Left is controlled by right and vice versa.

you should also disconnect the 5-wire sensor connector.  Just like the three wires that power the motor, the sensor wires cross over to the opposite side of the circuit board

The broken motor can be left in place or you could remove it and replace it with a regular long board wheel.  Alternativley, remount mount one of the unpowered Land wheel wheels from the front trucks to replace the broken motor.  Then  mount a complete set of trucks from a different manufacturer on the front.  When you reassemble the drive, don't over tighten the Allen nuts that hold the electronics cover in place.  They only need to be gently turned until until flush,  don't tighten beyond that. If you do the cover will crack.

If you do decide to operate the land wheel as a single motor drive (which I have never done), then it would probably be best to push start to to a good speed before engaging the remote.  Also, keep in mind that your brakes will be particularly weak.

I'm curious.  How heavy of a rider are you.  I'm taking a poll to see if rider weight is related to the motor failure.

I don't have a V3 and I have not been able to take the V2 motors apart to look on the inside.  The allen screws have stripped when I try to remove them.  However, it is a brushless motor so in theory, the only thing that would make a scraping sound would be sensor wires with the insulation melted off. In that case you would need a new motor.  

Running without sensors, brushless motors tend to have much less torque -- especially starting from a stop.  So I would guess that your sensor wires are melted and that you can run sensorless if you push start.  However, with the sensor wires melted, you risk damaging the sensor portion of the circuit board.  I would ask for a replacement motor if they will ship you one.  Otherwise, you could try removing one motor a per my previous post.  Or send Landwheel a video of the malfunctioning motor and wait for a replacement unit when they fix the problems.

At 167 pounds, you are half way between my son (100 pounds)  who has no problems with the Landwheel and me (210 pounds.  For me, the V2 Landwheel motor fails within seconds.  The failure is always on the same side.

Landwheel posted that the problem is improperly assembled motors that cause the sensor wired to fray and short circuit.  I have an alternate theory but no proof.  I suspect that under heavy acceleration load a strong current runs through the sensor wires and melts off the insulation. If my theory is correct, the circuit board is causing the motors to fail.  If the Landwheel analysis is correct, the failures originate in the motors.

If they can fix this problem then they will be on the way to having a reliable product.  I think we all wish them success.

I weight roughly the same as you around 205-210. Weather and life with a 2 year old makes it really hard to ride recently (she either wants to get on which result is slow rides up and down the driveway or she wants me to blow bubbles and whatnot)

I had two V2s, both lasted about 1-2 miles, I think the battery connections went bad after the sparking, then road vibration disconnects it and turns the boards off. I now have the V3, they definitely need larger batteries to accommodate heavier loads. Many people use these not just for fun, but as an alternative form of transportation, so carrying a heavy backpack with books, laptops, groceries should be part of the equation. 

I NEVER start from a stand still, and I usually do gradual acceleration. Belt drive has more torque, so when you "punch it" it really feels like you are moving.

I have a second LW V3 that I haven't opened, my colleague decided not to but it after the V2's epic failure, he rather have something proven, can't blame him...I wish there's a way to pair two receivers with one remote, instant 4WD, that would help right?

When weather and time permits. I plan to ride my usual route which would be a 10 mile round trip, will likely take an Uber home since only my DIY is the only one that can make that trip and still have 70% battery. Maybe I won't even make a mile? I'm not sure what performance changes they made with V3, but I'm 80% sure I can kill this thing

Hi Mike:

You don't really need to pair the remotes.  Its not rocket science to hold one remote in each hand.  If you have two 32 Volt V3's then I'd go ahead and put those on one skateboard.  I think it will lower your odds of frying the V3's before LW sends out its next batch of replacements.  Another option you might have is to add the V3 to the front of your DIY board.

The  picture that I sent of the Hybrid 6355/Landwheel actually has a second conventional Land wheel mounted on the front. I use the  6355's to get up to speed and then push on the second remote to activate the conventional landwheel V2. 

I've only done two passes in a parking garage because it's freezing cold out.  Even with two 24 volt drives connected to one board, the acceleration is still well below boosted board  (for me as a 210 pound rider).   

I'm afraid to take more test runs for fear of blowing the V2 Drive motor(s). I'll probably reserve it for my son for the summer.  For him, the 4WD skateboard would be a 35 MPH rocket.  I have a second boosted board on order so I'm not sure if he will ride the 4WD skateboard much.  The 4WD unit weighs a tonne.  He can barely pick it up.

I think one of the problems with my 6355 set-up is that I had to run the motors without sensors.  The sensors on the Landwheel circuit board had the same connector but a different number of wires and different order of wire colors.  

Without sensors, the brushless motors run with about half the torque especially from the start.  With sensors, the ECS knows how to both pull and push against the magnets.  Without the sensor, I think the ESC only knows how to pull the stator arms towards the next magnet.

I'm thinking of purchasing a new ESC to drive the 6355 motors.  Running those motors with sensors, the acceleration might be pretty good just as a 2WD skateboard.  However, I'm still concerned that the 24 volt battery will fall short.  I could wire two 24 volt batteries in parallel to double the amps.  But I'm afraid that If I wired them in series for 48 volts, that I would blow the on-board charge controller that reside within the batteries.

So just to confirm, your V3 is still working, its just does not have the power to get you 210 pounds up to speed at a satisfying pace, Correct?  Also, you always push start.  You never use the remote from a stand still?  Correct?

Thanks Paul

YES, V3 is working but haven't even done a mile as of yet.

Acceleration is on the slow end. like trying to get onto a freeway/highway ramp with a 4 cylinder car

the thing with LW, Onan and Mellow, is that they are all just dual hub with everything in one unit. saying they are a rip off is like saying cars copy each other because they have a steering wheel and wheels. Onan definitely copied Mellow. LW is more like inspired by Mellow.

I don't see a huge problem here (not that I'm an attorney). If Mellow delivers on their promised quality, they will be the luxury version. LW is a Honda....sadly at the moment, they are the lowest model of Honda with recalls

I really want to turn one of the older models into a 1 wheel drive for my 8yr old grom.  Such a waste to let them collect dust. 
Anyone had more problems with V3?  Since it finally stopped raining I would love to take it out to see what she's made of tomorrow but work calls and I'll be out of town till early next week. Fingers crossed that I can get at least a few miles out of this one. On the plus side, the personal one on one customer service is amazing and rare. That and it has a cool box and a poster.....

I received my v3 yesterday and rode it twice. Once for about 5-7min and once for 15min all in fast mode.

So far so good, I weigh 170 pounds and the board is really fast for me, definitely noisier than the previous 2 versions, although the noise goes away near full speed. I reached 21mph easily. I'm taking it easy for now though, slowly throttling up, I noticed that once you reach full throttle after about 2 seconds the board feels like it goes up a gear with more torque and more speed.

I have an Onan X1 (1st gen) so I'm used to kick the board first before giving it some gas, I think everyone should do this, it's better for range and components fatigue, if you don't know how to kick then you shouldn't this thing at all.

I tested both my batteries, one thing I noticed is that half the time I load them onto the drive there's a little spark. The drive is a little thicker because the battery is thicker. One last thing, the remote's battery seems to still be crap...

Rhino in flight:
It will be tricky to find a replacement hub motor. The Land wheel sensor connection may be non-standard.  They are different from torque boards anyway.  I'm not sure if any hub motors run sensor less.  The landwheel motors don't run without sensors.  Could be the same for others.   As per my post on the 6355 hybrid landwheel, its possible but lots lots of work and you have to run sensorless unless you also want to replace the ECS. Also, its my theory that the LW circuit board is responsible for melting down the sensor wires in the motor.  So if I'm right then any replacement motor could melt down if you do connect the sensor circuit.  Try the single wheel drive solution first.  It's free and only an hour of work. I provided instructions in a previous post.

It is true that the capacitors retain a charge after the battery is removed and that you can discharge the circuit by pushing the power button after the battery is removed.  As you re-install the batteries, the capacitors will draw current and recharge.  I'm pretty sure that is the source of your arching. If you want to stop the arcing, apply di-electric grease. You probably know that arching happens when voltage jumps across an air gap.  Di-electric grease eliminated the air gap.  It will also prevent arching as you ride and hit bumps in the road.

Actually, I do mean dielectric grease.  Silicone grease is conductive.  Dielectric grease is an insulator. The land wheel battery terminals are spaced pretty close together. You would not want to use silicone grease on the LW battery contacts because it could conduct current across terminals if the film is continuous between contacts.  Obviously that would produce a short circuit.  Dielectric grease does not interfere with the electrical connection once the two metal contacts are mated.  However, as the contacts approach each other and the air gap narrows, dielectric grease will act as an insulator to prevent arcing. 


I used dielectric grease very successfully to prevent arcing on the LW V2 batteries.  Without it the battery contacts were heavily damaged after the first short ride.  The vibration caused air gaps and the arcing was significant.

Silicone grease would be good for a permanent contact that is screwed down tight and is not disconnected while the current is live.  Dielectric grease is more appropriate for switch contacts to prevent arcing. If you put silicone grease on switch contacts, it won't stop arcing because it is conductive.  Furthermore, when subject to arcing, silicone grease produces bi-products that actually damage switch contacts.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone_grease

"Silicone grease should not be applied to (or next to) any switch contact that might experience arcing, as silicone can convert to silicon-carbide under arcing conditions, and accumulation of the silicon-carbide can cause the contacts to prematurely fail. (British Telecom had this problem in the 1970s when silicone Symel® sleeving was used in telephone exchanges. Vapor from the sleeving migrated to relay contacts and the resultant silicon-carbide caused intermittent connection.)"

maybe you can prevent arcing with anti electric grease and maybe this battery is unique in that you can't add an antispark and the contacts will deteriorate with connection but that's not normal and for battery connections using only compression to make connections I've only ever seen conductive grease.   A compression connection for a battery is rare to begin with.  I wonder how much resistance it has with  either conductive or dielectric grease.

you say the contacts were getting damaged from just one ride?  If it's arcing then it's losing contact and that might also be stopped with the conductive grease I think.   If they were damaged from arcing wouldn't you board be losing power often..every time the connection was broken?  as it is now with the dielectric grease you would still have breaking connections just not the burn marks as it arcs.  You'd be having more time with a broken connection with dielectric vs conductive.  

conductive you definitely don't want to connect terminals where it shouldn't be and you have to take care about that but it generally stays put.

Hi Hummie:

Good question.  You asked what the resistance was with the dielectric grease on the battery contacts.  I put an OHM meter to it.  The answer is 0.2 OHMS.  If I measure the resistance of an inch of 10 gauge copper wire, the same meter also reads 0.2 OHMS.  So the dielectric grease adds no resistance when there is contact.  It only insulates in the context of an air gap.

I recognize that it is counter-intuitive to put insulating grease on battery contacts.  However, it does work.  And as per the wikipedia article you should never put conductive silicone grease on contacts that may arc.

Prior to winter, my son drove the one landwheel V2 that continued to function. He rode about 10 kilometers before the snow fell. He rode it with a healthy layer of dielectric grease on the contacts.  That unit had no arcing and no signs of intermittent connection.  Before I started adding dielectric grease to the contacts, the arching damage was pretty aggressive.  I'm just sharing this information with V3 Riders because  I'm confident based on experience that dielectric grease will extend the life of the contacts.

Also, I'm confident that the dielectric grease played no role in the failures of my landwheels.  Three broke before I started adding the grease. Two broke after.  Rider weight seemed to be the one consistent variable in the failures. The unit that continued to function was never ridden by me. It was only riden by my son.  I disassembled three of the broken units and determined that the sensor wires were damage in the left motor of each unit.

Hi Pantologist:

If you look at some of the earlier posts, you will notice that the Landwheel representative posted that the V3 immediate shut down error was due to a short circuit in the "Hall Line".  Search for those two words and you will find his post above.

When he says "Hall Line"  he is referring to the five wires that connect to the Hall Sensors in the motor.  Hall sensors tell the motor controller what position the stator is is in so that the motor controller in the ESC can send the correct polarity of current to the correct coils.  There are three coils on the interior of a brushless motor.  The current through those coils needs to pull the stators towards the magnet that ahead of it's rotation.  Several magnets  are mounted on the inside of the cylindrical motor housing.  Torque doubles when the ESC is smart enough to push away from one magnet and pull towards another.  The ESC needs Hall sensors to do this.  Some brushless motors can function sensorless but torque is compromised, especially at start-up.  I believe that sensorless operation only provides for pulling forward (no dual action).

The land wheel rep indicated that in the motors that they examined that had failed, the wires running to the hall sensor were damaged.  He attributed it to faulty workmanship.

I replied that I was suspicious that the hall sensor wires may have been damaged by an excessive current flowing through the small hall sensor wires when the motor was subject to heavy load (such as accellerating a heavy rider).  That's exactly the moment that each of my landwheels blew the left motor.

I was unsuccessful in disassembling the malfunctioning motors.  The screws appear to have lockite on them.  However, I was able to identify which motors were functioning and which were defective by swapping motors around.  Also, With a continuity tester and OHM meter, I was able to verify that the three stator coils on the damaged motors were intact and normal compared to working motors.

By process of elimination, the sensor wires are at fault.  This was corroborated by my observation that one of the Land Wheel circuit boards had a manfunctioning sensor circuitry on the side that was connected to the broken motor.  I estimate a short circuit of the sensor wires in the motors damaged the sensor circuitry.

One more observation that I'll mention is that most brushless motors have six sensor wires.  I believe that's one pair of wires for each of three hall sensors.  Oddly, the LandWheel V2 motors only have 5 wires. I suspect that the absence of the sixth wire might be a factor if indeed an overload current is flowing through the sensor wires.  I'm wondering if one of the hall sensor circuits has only one sensor wire and if the circuit is completed via one of the wires that run to the stator coils.  That's just speculation since I can't get the motors apart.

Thanks  "Landwheel".

I suggest the following testing program.  

Test 6 different Landwheel V3.

With 220 lb rider (or rider carrying enough weight to add up to 220):

**I  Endurance tests:**
    1) Try up hill 1 kilometer 10% grade. (Repeat x 10 per LW)
    2) Try continuous ride, top speed from full battery until empty battery.  (Repeat 2x per LW)

**II Acceleration Load Tests:**
    1) Try full acceleration from a stop to full speed without kick starting (repeat x 10)

**III Rough Road tests:**
    1) Try the endurance and acceleration tests  (I & II) on rough pavement.  
        If you can't find rough pavement then spread 1/4 inch grains of gravel or salt on the concrete floor of the warehouse. Use glue to hold the grains to the testing surface.
    

**IV Road Crack Test:**
1) Drive over sidewalk with expansion gaps 
  example (http://ww.stonegraphix.com/Gallery/sidewalk_A.JPG)  
  or 
2) drive over 3/4 inch plywood to simulate cracks in the road.  Use two pieces of plywood with a 1 inch gap between them. Glue  or screw the plywood to the warehouse floor so they do not slide.

Road Crack Simulation Diagram:

________________------------------__--------------------_____________________
Warehouse Floor.......Plywood......Gap...Plywood..........Warehouse Floor  

  Try to ride over both sheets of plywood at full speed with 220 pounds of rider weight.

  Repeat 10 times per landwheel

**V 250 pound  load.**
Repeat tests I, II, III, IV  with 250 pounds of rider weight.

If  all 6 landwheel V3 can survive 8 these tests then the units shipped to customers should be pretty reliable.

If the landwheels fail during any test, then the test should help identify the vulnerability.

I like that extensive test mentioned by PK. It's a bit extreme, but LW needs to realize their customers all ride differently and have different needs and it's only a matter of time before we kill faulty designs, engineering and manufacturing. Because of LW previous issues, I personally would not ride it as rough as I do with my other boards that have proven to be dependable by abusive riders aka Casey or easily fixable in my garage with knowledge from people in this forum. 

I guess many of us are lucky to have Uber that can give us a ride if we get stranded. BUT I'm not sure what the liabilities are if the board bursts into flames in their car

i appreciate all of the help and i do have hopes for Landwheel to get these bugs worked out and make a great product.

I expected would happen, my v3 doesn't work anymore
I don't know what it could be, I drove for about two minutes with a charged battery and after changing slightly rougher the asphalt drive type is disconnected by sending one long beep until I turned off
Now if remote controller signal not power back up or better battery indicator drive reports download but you are charged
My v3 worked then for about 5/6 cycles battery
the first day was more powerful, I realized that the couple declined after two days Although slight had a power failure
now my v3 how do I repair?

Does anyone in the USA want to sell me their broken V1, V2, or V3 Landwheels (cheap).  I'd like to do a few science experiments to teach my 13 year old son some electronics and mechanical skills.

I'm holding off for a few more months before I ask Eileen to ship me my 6 replacement V3's.  No point taking delivery of them with so much snow on the ground.

If you are interested in getting the broken skateboards out of your basement, let me know.  Here is a temporary Email Address  (that I can delete in a few weeks when the spam starts rolling in):

ScienceProject@kasanda.com

For shipping, I can provide a New York Post office box. I live in Canada but can drive across the border. I can pay via Paypal.

Thanks, send me an email and we can discuss price and shipping cost.

@pkasanda you have/had 6 broken drives and that wasn't enough for you to experiment on? what on earth are you trying to do over there?

At this point, I'm wondering if you should wait for V4 or have @Landwheel  fly you to China and teach their people along with your son while you are at it.

He Mike:

I have some experiments in mind that will need a few more broken Landwheels.  I'd like to try to synchronize two drives to one remote for a 4WD single remote board.  I may fry a few boards in the process. If I'm successful, I'll post a how to video in case others want to try it with the more reliable V3's that we are hoping for in the future.  

I'd like to try it a few different ways.  First I'd like to try it with the stock Landwheel circuit boards.  Second, I'd like to try it with four aftermarket VESC's.

Hence, I'd like a few more broken Landwheels.

[quote="pkasanda, post:354, topic:5427"]
One more observation that I'll mention is that most brushless motors have six sensor wires.  I believe that's one pair of wires for each of three hall sensors.  Oddly, the LandWheel V2 motors only have 5 wires. I suspect that the absence of the sixth wire might be a factor if indeed an overload current is flowing through the sensor wires.  I'm wondering if one of the hall sensor circuits has only one sensor wire and if the circuit is completed via one of the wires that run to the stator coils.
[/quote]

I'll confirm in a second, but the second pin is missing the wire. That is the temp sensor. You can check that out in the schematic of the Vesc. It does not matter without one. The ESC just does not know the temp of the motor.

Hey Rhino:

Once you video the problem to prove to Landwheel that the unit needs to be replaced, can you try three experiments please:

1) Try disconnecting both sensors.  In the V2, you needed to cut off the shrink wrap and use a jack knife to peel off the glue and pry apart the connectors.  I'm curious if the drive will operate sensorless.

2)  Disconnect the left side only, including the three motor wires and sensor.  Reconnect the right sensor. Does one of the motors now operate with the remote?

3)   Opposite experiment as #2.  Connect the left side, disconnect the right.  Does one of the motors now operate with the remote?

What were you doing when the unit failed?

Mixed up Sensor wires? Unless they are intentionally mixed up? Temp wire and Blue sensor wires are mixed up. Seems like the orange wire indicates the temp sensor wire since it is obsolete on the ESC input.

I have riden on the road but also done quite a lot on the pavement (the majority of which was far from smooth) with many cracks, also short steep hills. I also found going back over a steep hill to be quite good, just needed a little push start at the beginning.

Re: Sensor wire mix-up

I think Landwheel is making/subcontracting their own ESC.  So it's not known if they are intending to follow the standards set by Benjamin Vedder.  The V2 Landwheel was one wire short on the sensors which caused me to wonder if this missing wire was related to the near 100% failure rate of V2 landwheels.  

But, I guess that's all old information.  Can someone with a broken V3 post a picture of the complete V3 circuit board.  Someone posted a partial and it looked like there were 6 sensor wires but it was not clear.  

I'm really just curious if there are now 6 sensor wires.

Update...

I tried the connection described below.  It was unsuccessful.  The remote activated both sets of drives but the speed was unstable.  The power to the wheels cycled on and off.  Then when I undid the connections, the receiver was no longer able to connect to the remote. So looks like I fried one receiver.  I cut the power to the second receiver before the experiment so it was unharmed.
Given that the experiment failed with the V2 -- obviously, its not worth risking with a V3.

End of update... 

So I'm trying to network two landwheel V2 Drives together to work with a single remote.  I want to try this with the V2's because they are in my mind "disposable" if I fry something.  I'd like to master the skill before my V3's arrive.  

I've read up on other threads that you can network two ESC's together by patching one receiver to two boards.  Normally receivers have 3 wires. You patch two of the wires to both boards but you patch the center wire to only one of the boards because the center wire is the power to the receiver.  You don't want to double the power to the receiver.

Here is a link to where I gathered this info.
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-faq-connect-two-vesc-via-canbus-for-dual-motors/142/42

In the link above, Nik provides a picture illustrating the center wire cut on one of the boards --resulting in 5 wires total connected to the 3 ESC leads.

The LandWheel V2 has 5 wires because its already connected to two ESC's.  I figure if I identify the one that has power, the the remaining 4 are the ones that I patch over to the second board.

I've rigged up a Landwheel drive so that it gets power externally. This allows me to access the circuit board while the drive is powered up.  Using a DC voltage meter, I find the following voltages:
1) 28v  (pin cosest to the front of the box, furthest from the wheels)
2) 0.8v
3) 0.5v
4) 1.6v
5) 3.3v

So I'm thinking it's pretty obvious that the first pin is the power and that if I patch over the other four wires to the corresponding locations on the second drive, that I will have a good chance of networking two drives to one remote.

Before I proceed, is there anyone who knows more than me on this topic that might like to offer advice or experience?

Landwheel:

Regarding the testing and hall sensor wire damage problem:

I have some disassembled Landwheel V2 drives, trucks and motors sitting on my workbench. I just realized something very surprising. 

There is no metal key to prevent the motor from rotating on the shaft.  If the motor rotates on the shaft, then this would squeeze, pull, or sheer the wires.  The only safeguard against the motor rotating on the shaft is the compression of the axle nut.  I'm not sure that's enough. In fact, I'm pretty sure it is not enough.  

I'm thinking this leaves the wires very vulnerable to sheer forces, impacts and other stresses.  Has the design changed for V3?  Is there a new design that mechanically locks the motor to a fixed position on the shaft?

Take a look at these two hub motors that I spotted on-line.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/c/5c8c52845922488e9c80cfa0fd19c565104919a8.png" width="295" height="238">

Notice one has a square recess that locks the motor from rotating on the shaft.  The other has a "flat detail" that also prevents rotation.

I have one more observation that I feel is very relevant.  I just now took apart one of my Broken V2 Drives that I had never disassembled before.  Both Axle nuts were only finger tight.  Literally "finger tight". I removed them with a deep socket and my fingers -- no wrench.  If the intention was a friction fit, then I doubt the nut was tightened enough to support that.

Can you comment on the V3 motor design and if it has been changed to have a mechanical interlock that would prevent rotation on the axle shaft?

Kind Regards,

Braking is very abrupt,  just a cheap ESC not much you can do about that other than replace with VESC yourself.    In addition to that i've had many remote cutouts and even acceleration after i released from the throttle...scary stuff.   and for me i'm still getting the Hall Sensor issue on one of the two replacement V3 units sent back to me.

how fast was "high speed"? tighter trucks would help with stability. Carving instead of doing straight away will also help. work on braking with your foot, it's a good thing to know in case anything goes wrong.

Having opened up the V2 and just looking at the V3 drive housing and battery connectors I would not ride it in the rain. Although they advertised the unit to be IP54 (Dust and Splash resistant I think) There are no rubber seals anywhere that would prevent water from getting in. The motor might be splash resistant hence the IP rating?

Landwheel:

Re wire damage at motor entry point...

I have one more observation that is potentially relevant to hall sensor failure.  Based on observing V2 drives, I feel that the wires need more slack or that perhaps the wires should not be routed through the center of the truck.  I notice that the V2 motors that failed appear to have wires that have been pulled partially out of the motor.  Specifically, insulation is pulled away exposing bare wire where the wires turn 90 degrees to enter the motor.  Also, I can observe the wires pull away from the motor when the skateboard is up side down and when I compress the trucks fully to the left and to the right.  More slack might work.  Routing directly to the housing without going through the center of the trucks might work.  Embedding the wires in a block of plastic or rubber where it threads into the motor is another potential solution.

I recommend you take an especially close look at this as a potential cause of wire damage.  I notice that your videos of product testing are "static".  You are testing the drive against blocks of styrofoam and bashing it against the ground.  You need a heavy rider taking the drive through deep turns in order to subject the drive and wiring to the real life stresses that your customers are applying to the drives.  Failures in the lab are good.   It prevents failures after the products are shipped.

And last comment for today.  I saw the diameter tolerance test that appeared in your video.  Keep in mind that it was not all wheels that were out of round.  Most were in-round.  The odd one was out of round.  It means that only one or two mold cavities are out of round.  You need to test a wheel from each and every cavity of each and every mold.

after about 5k on perfect asphalt, flat, 0 degree incline it started to lose connection. (short time, but noticeable)

then it worked ok for about 5 min. and after it shut off constantly and was too weak to power the board at all.

Realistically what is the permanent improvement V4 should have to resolve this dangerous connector. I assume not removing the battery and adding in a port on the drive to charge directly would be a good idea? @Landwheel It looks like V3 is doomed to fail sooner or later.

Hi @bbq870, First of all, we are sorry for the problem.
The reason of losing connection is that the crystal oscillator on remote  receiver is not perfect in SMT process, it will be loose when the drive  vibrated terribly.
We have started to solve it, There are two solution ways:
1.The receiver directly built into the controller to reduce the failure  rate.
2. To thicken the thickness of the receiver, and add more tin when we  solder the components, make it more firm.
If you have any questions, you can contact our sales. We will help you to  solve the problem. Thank you

Hi mike, Thanks for you feedbacks. 
The sparking phenomenon is due to the fact that there are two large  capacitors on the control panel, when the battery contacts
terminals, the capacitors on control panel will be charged instantly. 
This is a normal physical situation, we also looking ways to improve it. As  the contactors are gold-plated, and contact way is changed to three-points  connection. It won't lead to short-circuit when you riding. V3 contact is  safe.

Mike:

My experience with the V2 is that dielectric grease stopped both the initial spark when inserting the battery and the arcing damage to the contacts when driving over rough surfaces.  Conductive silicone grease should never be used where arcing is a possibility.  See my previous post on this topic for Wikipedia links that state the same information.  Also, arching is more likely if you push the power button to drain the capacitor before inserting the battery.  The arching is caused by the capacitors drawing power to charge up.  If the capacitors are already full, they will draw less current when the battery is inserted.

Hey Pantologist:

Looking at the schematic that you posted, I'm looking at the 6 pin power/comm connector.  Can you advise me on which pins to use to connect an LED power switch?  I'm guessing red and green are for the momentary switch and yellow and white are for the LED light.  I could be wrong though.  Do you know which pins are for power up and which pins are for the power indicator light?

Landwheel:

You are working on the problem of preventing damage to the motor wires.  That's good.

I notice that there is one very important issue that several posters have commented on.  Many have commented that the Landwheel e-brakes are very weak at higer speeds, but that the brakes lock and throw the rider off the board about 10 feet before the rider expects the board to stop.  These complaints are accurate.  As one of the posters who owns a boosted board, I can tell you that the boosted boards have much safer brakes.  They are stronger from high speed and they don't lock as the board slows down.  The braking force is very proportional to the input on the remote.  I think the fundamental difference is that boosted board is trying to drive the motors in reverse to accomplish deceleration.  Land wheel is trying to magnetically lock the rotating stator  arms to the fixed magnets.  This works poorly at higher speeds (poor brakes) and results in locking at low speeds.  If Landwheel is potentially faster than boosted board (for some riders) it needs better brakes.  It is also not acceptable that heavy riders will not be able to stop effectively from high speeds.  I'm recommending that you look at using reverse power to for braking under most conditions.  I think battery overcharge condition is the only situation where the magnetic lock approach makes sense. I'm operating on the assumption that reverse power forces some electrical charge back into the batteries and that the magnetic lock does not. I think the magnetic lock should only be used an an emergency brake when the battery is at or near overcharge.

Finally, I'd recommend that the slider on the remote allow for the board to stop and then continue into reversing.  Its a strong safety feature at an intersection.  If you overshoot an intersection, then backing away from it quickly is very important.  Its one of the things that I really love about my boosted board and OneWheel.

I'm wondering if some other posters can back me up on the importance of improving the Landwheel braking.  Mike, you have a boosted board so please chime in.

I don't ride at high speed because I do not trust my own abilities on the streets I ride on and can't risk any major injuries due to a young child at home, usually 17-19mph at most on any board, 22-24 a few times during short testing or really smooth road. I have noticed that the V3's braking is more abrupt compared to the V2. I have not had the opportunity to brake while going fast (never had the emergency need to do so) 

I actually like the drag from belt drives because I can essentially coast to a easier stop as long as it's anticipated. One thing I do is stop, stay on my board and keep the toggle pulled back to apply brakes so I remain stopped if I'm talking to someone and whatnot. THAT is one thing I hate about the Boosted board because the second it comes to a full stop, it reverses, there needs to be a pause where after it stops, it needs to be reset to zero before it goes in reverse.
```

Mike:
I think 19 MPH is fast enough to want strong brakes/rapid braking. But your comments are interesting.  I guess everyone has their own braking preferences.  For me, the boosted board brakes are ideal. I can go from top speed, down to a stop in a couple heart beats.  I feel glued to the board when I stop.  The board never stops faster than me. Instant reverse is something I like and I don't find myself accidentally reversing at the end of a stop.

During the summer, I ride the boosted board and onewheel at top speed every day.  I use the boards to run my dog and to go boarding beside my 13 year old son. My son and I ride and stop the same. But I guess other riders are going to have their own distinct needs and preferences.

What would be cool is if the LandWheel was running the Benjamin Vedder open source software and if the owner could configure the VESC to brake according to their own preferences.  Benjamin's software lets you choose between "Ebrake" and "Duty Cycle".  I thinks that's the difference between the way that brakes are applied in Landwheel vs. Boosted Board.

You commented that the boosted board should lock stationary before heading in to reverse.  Personally, I have no complaints about immediately going into reverse.  Even still, you have a neat idea.  I agree that when stopped on an incline, a stationary lock feature would be handy. 

Landwheel has the stationary lock.  But more than one poster has commented that the brakes are too weak at faster speeds.

One personal suggestion I have for you is to practice rapid deceleration on the boosted board repeatedly until you are fully comfortable with a full tilt stop.  Its an important skill to master when there is no emergency--so that you can use it when there is an emergency.

Are you sure what they are selling is a V4? I have a hard time believing that alibaba has newer drives than those of us who are still testing The V3 directly from landwheel. I have been riding the V3 quite a bit and no issues after the one loud beep that wouldn't stop unless I pulled the battery. The drive is annoyingly loud, but seems rideable.

Have you guys ridden a DIY board like the ones we build here? Majority of us use VESC as a speed controller of choice because of reliability and the ability to adjust settings. Or maybe ride a Boosted boards? Brakes should be soft and not a sudden deceleration that causes a ridder to fall. You may think having hard and fast brakes is good, but this only cause the board to stop, the person on the board will fall forward.  

One unit stops harder than the other one

our brake system is electronic linear brake, so you need to brake slowly, better don't pull it to the bottom directly.

"Don't pull it to the bottom directly" that is Obvious.

the problem with it is that the two drives do not act the same which is a quality control issue on your part. Pulling the toggle back slowly on drive #1 results in a gradual slow down, pulling the toggle back slowly on drive #2 results in nothing happening for a bit, then the the board jolts when the brakes is suddenly activated.

What @Mikenopolis is saying is right. 

Even if pull back the breaks slightly it is way too sensitive.  This means that the faster I go the greater risk I have of falling off. Although I still find it dangerous I find that only after a lot of practice I am able to break safely. Saying that, I can't go too fast because of the dangers of breaking.

If you drive a car you need to be able to break suddenly and abruptly for emergencies. But if I am riding my skateboard at 20 mph and suddenly a danger appears (a car in front breaks suddenly) of course I need to break suddenly to avoid danger. But with your breaking system that would only make me fall off the skateboard into the car in front. 

It is simply too sensitive.

If I go at the slowest possible speed it is still really easy to "jolt" forwards from breaking. This shouldn't happen

I think the idea is very sexy. Being able to make every board ina few minutes into an E-board is awesome. If the perfomance is enough for relax riding and having fun then it might even be awesome. It will definetly not be an option though for long distance riding. We will see how they hold up.

yes, the concept is great for quick board setup, their V2's brakes were much better but all the other issues made it fail. the V3 durability is still good as there are no seriously failures reports thus far, but as @mbkahn3 said, it's dangerous and forcing us to go slower just to be safe makes it not fun

Hello everyone, Landwheel has refined the design and have been fulfilling their warranty, they have worked and done well to recover from the premature fulfilment and lack of testing and have improved aspects of the production. Through this, they have come close to the stage where they will have crafted amazing product that has awesome features and a quality assurance that'll suit lots of people. 

I have been testing all their prototypes from the beginning as a sample customer and am proud to see what it's coming to now, the brakes are one of the last things to be adjusted as @pkasanda has noted and softer 85a rated bushing are going to be used. I've only recently found this forum and I'm loving how the DIY community has helped refine this product directly with the manufacturer, V3 performed very well for me and the only real issue I've had with it is the braking being too weak at high speeds and too strong as slow speeds, I will be testing the final version soon once it's ready and I'm sure all issues have been ironed out.  

I am the director of a UK based limited company who will be supplying a variety of professional electric vehicles that have quality assurance, we've been generating interest for this drive system and will begin taking pre-orders of the final version drive system with a custom cruiser deck option soon for delivery aimed for June. 

The launch cost will be around £575 for the drive system and £75 for the optional deck as we're trying to make it obtainable for as large an audience as possible, subscribe to our email list on our website for a money-off discount and the launch information when it's available. Full details of the drive can be found at bit.ly/AL3DHD and Landwheel will continue the job they're doing well to receive further feedback and pursue a finalised reliable solution. 

We are trying to get this kind of cleaner technology in the hands of more people faster and this truly is an optimised electric boarding option, it's perfect for those who can't afford expensive electric boards or who love the practicality of the mountable system with its features. We have also released information regarding our first PAS rear hub electric bike and it will be also be sold for a fair cost in relation to other products available similar to its nature as part of our Alpha release.

This company has a promising future ahead of it as it's waiting to finalise details for the drive system and the Alpha MTB, with other electric board and vehicle releases to come including an All-Terrain belt driven board and bicycle conversion kits with options for the higher performance market like the mid-drive version of the Alpha MTB, another Asphalt attachable drive system and a possible full suspension MTB option. Follow us on our social media and remember to subscribe to our email list for that discount at www.yave.co.uk.

@Landwheel Why couldn't​ you guys put a just connector on the board itself? It would have made this thing some much easier to repair. 

I'm recycling this thing. :P

Well I finally got the beep of death. Is Eileen still working for @Landwheel ? She's been quiet online for a while. 

I rode this about five miles this morning without issues and it was actually an enjoyable ride. Charged up the battery and remote at the office. Decided to use it to go get coffee and meet with someone and this happen on the way there AND on the way back

The right motor on the v3 we have has hall sensor issues from heavy sliding and now beeps on and off and doesn't run completely meaning the drive can't be used, I tried to run it without the right sensor by disconnecting the right motors hall sensor cable on the left of the circuit board but it just continuously beeps, I don't think the drive can run without the sensors connected to both motors unless the programming can be altered. When stationary there are some positions where the drive doesn't beep but if the wheel is moved then the beeping happens. Oddly when I changed the direction by the switch I can run the other motor without the faulty motor and without stopping or beeping most of the time, and when it does begin beeping a push of the slider to accelerate stops it beeping and allows the other motor to turn again. Wierd.

This is why sensors suck... They are probably responsible for a few of the issues on the past models. 

Apparently TI has an​ algorithm that can predict the position of the motor and does not require pesky sensors.

Interesting, never knew about that, gonna look further into that for my own board. I hope the adaptions LW have made for their next version will prevent these issues, I believe they've altered the motor contact which I think has been the thing causing the issues.

Yave:

Try this.  Remove the malfunctioning motor from the axle. 

This requires disconnecting the wires from the circuit boards and threading the wires all the way out of the trucks.

Look at where the wires enter the motor.
Can you see bare copper wire in contact with the steel of the motor?  If so, try sliding some heat shrink tubing on to the exposed wires.   Shrink the tubing with a heat gun and re-assemble.

I've never tried it.  Let me know if it works.

I've been trying to take the hub off for a while, I removed the hub nut and the cables but for some reason the motor just won't come off. I had to scrape inside of the truck to get the prize the cable out because of the glue and I'm thinking that some glue is keeping the hub on the truck. I've been trying to scrape the part by the hub with a small flathead and even tried prying in between the hub and truck but with no luck, LW also don't know why it won't come off, any ideas?

So it looks like the heat shrink tubing around the wires was glued into the groove with a soft adhesive like silicone. If it is just silicone, then a small wheel puller should be able to dislodge the wheel from the axle.  However, if the wheel is held to the shaft using locktite then it would be necessary to heat the shaft to melt the locktite. Since there are electrical windings involved, the heating could destroy the motor.

What I find interesting here is that Landwheel seems to have decided to use an adhesive to prevent the wires from pulling out of the motor.  However, they have applied the adhesive to a loose fitting shrink wrap that will accomplish little if any thing to anchor the wires against pulling away from the motors. At the same time, they may have made the V3 motors un-removable.

It will be interesting to see if the V4 features the same mechanism for securing the wires to the trucks & motor.

Both drives worked well for about 5 miles before it happened. I'm glad they are working on the fix, hopefully this V4 board would also fix their horrible breaking as well and be their final product.

Landwheel:

If you are shopping around for a new circuit board or can you please consider picking one that has a USB connection that would allow the user to connect the board to the vedder BLDC tool and choose thier own settings.  For example, I very much prefer current control with reverse.   This setting allows me to switch to reverse immediately and I find braking with reverse to be much easier to control than the E-Brake method.  Alternatively, it would be great if the same settings could be change via blue tooth connection and phone app.

Thanks pk

You wrote 

"The braking system of V4 is stronger now."  

Stronger brakes are not necessarily better.  Several of us on the forum have complained that the Landwheel brakes are too weak at high speeds but way too strong at slower speeds.  When testing the V2, neither my son or I could stay on the board as it approached a stop.  We would have to jump of and run almost every time we stopped. It was not very safe.  Its a problem that we have never had on our boosted boards.

The ability to connect the board to the Vedder BLDC tool would allow riders to choose the best braking settings for their own needs. I suspect "current control with reverse" would be a much better setting for riders who find they can't stay on the board near the end of the stop.

One more comment on board set-up is that the pivot bolt needs to be a 1/2 inch longer than it was on the V2.  The bolt is too short to allow the trucks to be loosened up enough for a lighter rider.  Even for myself as a heavy rider, I find that the trucks are way too tight even when the pivot nut is on the last thread.  Setting up the trucks for the right amount of pivot is very important to  long board riders.  It is very limiting when  the board comes out of the box with very stiff trucks and the pivot nut is already on the last thread.  

I realize that the V2 bushings were to stiff and that you have switched to softer bushings.  Switching to softer bushings was the first thing that I did to make the V2 easier for my son to steer.  Even with the softest bushings, I still needed an extra half inch of thread if I wanted the trucks to pivot properly for safe and effective steering.

So I should clarify.  

I had some 1:1 conversations with the "Landwheel" rep who replies to this forum. We discussed the brakes in particular. Through those conversations, I arrived at the conclusion that that the landwheel circuit board is most likley running the Vedder software.  Vedder's software is open source so there would be nothing wrong with that. 

The Landwheel rep mentioned that they were switching from square wave to sin wave and that they were making adjustments to the brake force.  These as you may know are settings that can be changed via the vedder BLDC tool.

A VESC is essentially a small computer board that can be loaded up with firmware.  While the Landwheel board does not look like a VESC, I'm pretty sure it is running the Vedder firmware.

It is true that I am speculating a bit about the software that is already on the boards.  

But now I'l pose the question to everyone on the forum.  Thumbs up or thumbs down...

Would you like to be able to plug your Landwheel into the BLDC tool and adjust the setting?  Please use the like button to vote.

I do worry about how many of their customers are actually able to make adjustments without blowing something or endangering themselves. Us builders with some experience with VESCs and BLDC might be better at it than "normal" people. As frustrated as I am with these failed V3s I have now, I feel bad that Landwheel has to keep investing in R&D to make it work after this long. I truly appreciate their effort and customer service which is something very rare in Chinese businesses.

Hi Mike:

We don't see a USB port on the land wheel circuit board.  So presumably, Landwheel is loading the firmware in the factory either via Bluetooth or via some thing similar to a Canbus to USB adapter.  Obviously I'm speculating.

You pointed out that not all users would be competent to make these changes.  I agree.  I'm not proposing a USB port that is accessible to the outside of the case.  Only that a user who feels competent to take the cover off the electronics would have access to a USB port to change settings.

Honestly, I agree with the two of you.  I'm hoping for  a V4 that brakes safely. I don't get the sense that the Landwheel team has taken our braking concerns to heart -- possibly, they may not understand the concerns.

We talk about safer brakes that don't throw us off the front of the board at low speed.  Then we see comments from Landwheel that the V4 brakes are now stronger. 

Mike and I talk on this forum about how safe and proportional the boostedboard brakes are. I've tried to get Landwheel to look at using reverse power for braking instead of E-Brake. I'm concerned that the really important and helpful suggestions that the forum members are contributing on the topic of brake concerns just are not translating into the right type of changes.

So, not having confidence that the brakes are moving in the right direction -- (or may be moving in the wrong direction), I'm thinking the next best thing would be the option of choosing our own braking and reversing preferences.

it seems like 5 out of 5 people on here with the board are either already disappointed or have high hopes for some fixed version to come.   
If you've never ridden an eboard before maybe you'll be happy with its low power, but if you learn to plug a couple things together and go diy you can have a much much better and more reliable board.

by low power I mean the thing surely puts out little power because the few li-ion cells would be cooked otherwise and the esc must be programmed to keep amp draw low.  

the ease of attachment is super cool but in practice, as you've been the one to show more than anyone Mike, these things die within moments.   Given the choice of a diy board that will TRUELY put out 3000 watts and may take 2 weeks to get together vs buying this weak slow thing and spending a lifetime waiting and hoping one day they fix its problems and send it...Id rather the former.   But then a lot of people don't want much power or speed, until they hit a hill.

Just got a new circuit board from Landwheel. Looks like a simple swap. Hopefully this will fix the issues I have <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/2/024cc6b7c4d78e265e7883d4f9fddd3dd93567e4.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Hi Mike, 

Appreciate for your videos. We'd like to explain some differences between the old circuit board (pic 1) and new circuit board (pic 2), In the new circuit board, we do the changes as follows:

1.Change the Samsung capacitance
2. Add earth wire
3. Cancel Capacitance
4. Add capacitance and resistance

So there is looks something difference with the old one, please kindly check it.  @Mikenopolis

Hey Mike,

It's Fred from YouTube. Thanks for sharing all the details about v4.

Mine should arrive today, as I mentioned in your comment section I am still not too sure whether I should accept parcel... everything sounds great about V4, except for the brakes, possibly the most crucial part in any electric skateboard.
Did they make you pay shipping for the replacement parts? They respond rather quickly, which I appreciate, but if I have to pay shipping every time they send me one of their "beta" products, I think I am just gonna pass on the system entirely....

Say what you want about Koowheel and Benchwheel, but at least their brakes works very well :). Being scared for your life at 10mph doesn't exactly boost my confidence ;)

Landwheel has been great so far in their quest to improve their product and send all of us the new versions. Ultimately we all want a rideable board and landwheel wants a competitive product. It's a win win considering the price most of us paid to get the beta v1 and most of us are happy to provide feedback because I think their local feedback options are limited at best. I'll happily be patient as long as they keep working on producing a quality that eventually makes its way to my door step. They have never charged a shipping fee for later versions, and if they did, most of us would bail as the cost of multiple shipping from China would far exceed the cost of buying a boosted board outright. Keep up the good work landwheel. The more high quality e boards out there the better. Next on your list should be a 4 wheel drive off road version.

Hi Everyone, 

About our brake system, we use linear sliding positioner, the brake force is according to the brake range when you braking. As the picture shows, there are three intervals with brake force at 60%-80%-100%, you need to brake extremely slowly.
 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/1/c1010948ef9ddbc0133540d37f548b0db7656f2d.png" width="377" height="500">

Now we are still adjusting the brake force to be more comfortable. In order to avoid injuring, please practice brake more at low speed first. When you are familiar with it, then you can choose fast mode.

Thanks for all supports.
Landwheel

That was after about 1 mile, freshly installed. They look a lot worse now ;)

On the topic of wheels, just me or could be motorised wheels be a bit softer, their lower polyurethane thickness makes them a bit rough on the less than ideal roads around the city. I've been looking into moulding my own wheels for this, doesn't appear to be that difficult. In some of the car modding communities I'm in I've seen people pour their own bushes and mounts to stiffen up suspension, I'm thinking I could 3D print a thin brittle mould, pour the PU and and then just break the mould to remove. The accuracy of the 3D printer would set centre the motor perfectly (I hope) and as long as I get the air bubbles out i'm thinking I could get away without too much lathing / post processing. For London's roads a 100mm wheel would be a lot more forgiving for daily shredding.

Hey Guys,

Not been on here in a while.I just got my V4. What does everyone think overall? 

I have only ridden it for one day so far but I am still worried and don't feel safe riding it in the roads of London yet with the current braking system. What does everyone think of the braking of the V4?

The trucks seem to be much loser which is good for riding on the pavements around tight corners. But I have done a little bit of riding at fast speeds on the road but with the loose trucks it feels more unstable. Before they were too tight. I will tighten them but not sure which is the best balance because turning is way better now.

Search "gullwing" trucks. Double king pin. Super stable at high speeds with an excellent turn radius and carving abilities. I replaced the stock front trucks with these and never looked back. If landwheel did this with their drive trucks they would have the best carving electric skateboard in existence.

Okay so am I the only one who finds there is no improvement on the braking and in fact it might be worse?

I am also interested to know what speeds people go at, average and max

I don' know how accurate it was but I used a speedomeeter on my phone today. I realised that due to the braking issues and handling at high speeds I am only comfortable going at a max of 11mph and at a nice cruise pace of 7mph

Hey guys. I'm new to the forum and I'm very interested in getting an e-skateboard for myself. However I have seen many different brands such as landwheel, Onan, eon and recently walnut tech spectra.

I have also been following this thread for awhile now. But it seems quite inconclusive to me as to which brand is the most reliable now. 

I read some negative reviews about eon failing to deliver on their promise of sending out their products and Onan being somewhat unreliable in terms of customer service and after sales support. 

I am not keen on the walnut spectra's weight sensing feature and I feel that the remote control is a safer option.

So ultimately I'm back to landwheel, however I have seen some of u guys complain about the braking issues and others with issues with the board fresh from the factory.

I'm still a student, so budget and reliability is high on my list.

I would like to know if I should order a landwheel or if there are any other options available around. I'm from Singapore so my options are quite limited. 

Any feedback and replies will be greatly appreciated! 
:)

How much can you pay for?
Longboard? or short?

However, the drive is still being improved.

True. But considering the amount of work I have to put in. Sourcing the right components as well. Actually making sure my entire set up is weather resistant seems too much a hassle for me.

I'm 74kg's. When I say rough, I really just mean normal i.e not park smooth tarmac. London roads are generally made from rough aggregate to handle the heavier vehicles. The wheels are generally to hard for daily road use. I'm not sure about the nuts yet, Landwheel kindly sent me a deep socket driver to tighten them up and that's mostly fixed it, there does seem to a little bit of play in one hub even with a really tight nut, could be bearing related. A PU washer between the hip motor and the truck could be a solution to the metal on metal knocking that noticeable on the rougher surfaces.

Hi Mike,

Thanks for the advice. Do u mind recommending any threads with guides on diyboards? (Including where I may be able to get parts).

Also, is it possible to diy a setup with hub motors?

I was looking at landwheel as a place to start off, with something physical to tinker with it would be alot easier to understand how things should work. And it's also waterproof. In terms of performance, I'm not exactly looking for the fastest board I just want something that can get me from point a to point b hassle-free. 

Again, I understand why most advice I get prompts me to try and diy 1 myself and I greatly appreciate all replies and feedback. This is a great forum, thanks alot! :)

After 4 landwheels and months of riding I have finally fallen off it!

I realised today how flawed the acceleration is. I have always focused on the braking issues but not the sensitivity of the acceleration. With V4 I was warned that the acceleration takes time getting used to as it is sensitive. I do find I am better with it now and after a few rides it is okay. But keep in mind that I have been riding it on the pavement (sidewalk) and not much on the road. 

Today I was going a mere 3-5 miles an hour, suddenly out of nowhere the skateboard jolted, I flew off. I wonder and fear what would have happened if I was going faster. My fears have always been around braking but this time I was not braking. 

One positive of this board is it does seem to do very well going over rough surfaces and uneven pavements. So I was shocked to have fallen over. I think there was a tiny rock I went over which might have caused the fall. But the main reason was that by accident I had it on "fast mode" which accelerates much quicker. With V4 I have not been riding in this mode. It is simply way too sensitive.

either 4 or 8 screws/bolts is all that's needed. If you don't care for matching front trucks to rear, then you can just have a bunch of decks with permanent front trucks and swap the drive system from one to the other with just 4 screws

I have not read all the comments... I actually own a few Landwheel V4's sorry to tell you they are not water proof. I am working on this for my own set up. The hub motors may be water proof as for the ESC it is not enclosed properly. As for right now to keep any splashes that may get between the battery I I put a thin layer around the ESC cover
hope this helps I still would not submerge.

Hey guys

I think the LANDWHEEL V4 brake is too sensitive.

I want to proceed at a constant speed while braking slightly a long downhill. However, as the brakes are sensitive, I often fall from the board.

I have two other electric skateboards and the other two can go down hill at a constant speed while applying the brakes.

I have been using the Landwheel for about a month now and everything was going great. Unfortunately, while riding my board today it randomly shut off. After further inspection, it seems to be jammed inside of the casing and now the entire board does not work. When putting the battery in, the board automatically turns on without pressing the button, and will no longer accelerate or brake. My guess is that the board will not allow me to accelerate when the power button is being pushed in even when the board is on, which is a problem because the power button is stuck into the pushed position. Any suggestions for me landwheel or fellow riders?

Hello. I'm new here :). Since you guys share a lot of useful information and tips I decided to subscribe the forum. Cheers everyone 👍.
Yesterday I contacted what was supposed to be an Alibaba producer of the Landwheel board and she informed me that by the end of this month they will release version 5.
Do you guys have more information about this model?

Welcome to the forum.

Are you a current owner of a Landwheel or just looking to buy?

The "V5" is supposed to address the hard braking the V4 had, They haven't mentioned is the battery has been improved upon because V4 experiences a cut-off once the battery falls below 50% and some have gotten only a 3 mile range out of it. Lastly, V5 have larger wheels so address the vibration of the earlier iterations.

Hello Mikenopolis.

I was just looking for some information. 
I already knew about the company and the problems with all the previous versions.
Recently I found the V4 and when I searched a little more I found that, once again, it has problems.
By this point I think it is very probable that new V5 also comes with problems.
I was also considering the Onan X2. Do you possess any feedback about the quality and reliability of this board?.
Regards 😉

what is your budget and is this going to be your ONLY board. I have multiple boards therefore LW's issues never bothers me too much and I'm just patiently waiting...again for the next fix.

Onan has harsh brakes...most lower priced boards have either weak or harsh brakes. Their X1 were plagued with issues, X2 were better, I think they are at X3s now. If this modular system something you really want/need so you can use your own deck? I say this because CarvOn's current indigogo offering is at $749 at the moment and since I have a build with their drives this is a GREAT deal to jump on. Their drive system is on a Koowheel system, but will be calibrated in the US for quality assurances.

Yes, it's going to be my only board. Unfortunately ikonrtunately I can't afford another one. 
Landwheel seems to have very premium quality besides that problems. Though those are important failures, special the brakes o can easily throw out of the board...
I can go to a maximum 700$.
CarvOn's seems pretty good but the fact they don't possess good reviews on the board it's a now

Hey Mike, have you ever had a problem with the LW drive periodically beeping and not working (like 3 beeps/second including sound and light)? I'm waiting for them to send me another circuit board (V5 i guess) but just wondering if anyone ever came across something like this... They sent me a replacement circuit board previously to address this, but it did not help.

But yeah it's been like 3 months since I bought it and have only been able to use it for the 1st day then it broke lol...

For those of you who do not know, I'm one of 4 or 5 unofficial beta testers for Landwheel. That is, we are previous customers of their drives stemming from the FIRST version. One tester has had great communication with one of the engineer at LW who translates back to their team. We discuss the problems and improvements needed on their drives within a private forum here. The reason for that is to reduce negative reviews that would drive away future business since we all just want them to have a good and safe drive system. And they have been open to all our input and stood by their warranty.

The current situation is that they are nearing the completion of the "V5" which LW is calling "L3-X" and the beta tester will be sent these units in the next month (November). The 4 or 5 of us live in areas where weather is not an issue for esk8s and we have experience with various "better" boards or built our own boards which is why we were selected to test and provide feedback before they send out replacement units.

Keep your fingers crossed everyone. I'll update here once I know more.

This is an image from Onan’s factory. Do you see their testing “track” and “Hill”? I assume that’s how LW’s testing looks like. Many of us are actually riders on rough streets that truly test the durability of boards under vibration and hard acceleration and brakes.

It depends on what you think is safe

My V3 felt perfect in speed and brakes. Enjoyable until it stopped and beeped after 5 miles.I had to turn it off and on or remove the battery to reset. A few feet later it does it again, then again. 

They shipped me what we call a Version 4 circuitboard that supposedly fix that beep of death issue, but it gave harsh brakes, literally either go or dead stop which shoots you off the board. Than another V4 circuit board came (my current one) and there was a slight improvement. The brakes are no so sudden as seems to apply 40% then 60% then 100% brakes. So it still JOLTS instead of stopping you smoothly. There’s also cogging when braking. The next version is supposedly going to have smooth braking

Now I received the message that they got problems with "delivery parts" and will ship in middle of November, so delivery for me would be end of November.

Yes. We are all told mid November due to production shortage. I believe the battery redesign was the issue. The whole eSkate industry require patience. Most of us have waited months and even over a year for parts or board. It’s just not mature enough to have stock in hand at all times.

Kinda feel like I/we (Those that got in from the very beginning by sending a descent amount of money) are being neglected and all manpower is now being geared towards new customers.

I noticed that Michelle seems to be the one sales person that not that great towards LW customers in terms of service and communication. Hopefully Jason has some pull and can get you a working drive if that’s indeed what this is. At the end of the day, if we don’t get a working product we are SOL and our only option is to make these complaints public. If each of us make a video of our flawed systems it would be bad for their image (which is not great at this point). Try to be patient and see what Jason can do in terms for fulfilling what we all paid for, which is a WORKING drive. @pkasanda FYI might want to forward this to Jason?

So here is some good news for the forum.  I received a pre-production prototype L3-X from Landwheel and was able to do a few test runs before the snow fell in Canada.

It’s fantastic.  No risk of being thrown off the front of the board, no power downs or cut-outs.  With a light rider like my son (105 lbs) the Landwheel out accelerates and out brakes and exceeds top speed of the boosted board G2.  It’s now my son's favorite board. The brakes are really easy to control.  For him the acceleration is a little softer than the V4, but just marginally.  

For me, who weighs 225, I'm aware that the acceleration is a bit below the boosted board and the brakes are a little soft.  From 20 kph, I estimate I could stop about 15 - 20 feet sooner on our boosted boards.  The acceleration is still good.  I can tell that the new circuit board is carefully regulating the acceleration to prevent voltage sag, power reduction and power-cut-out.  So unlike the V4 that would suddenly drop to 50% power, the L3-X keeps accelerating.  The acceleration seems to be well regulated so that the battery voltage stays up in the range that prevents any type of power reduction that would shift the rider’s weight.

The remote now vibrates to indicate low power.  It may or may not vibrate when dropping down from one of the four battery levels to the next.  I was testing the L3-x  in -2 degrees celcius and the impact of the temperature on battery performance could have been a factor in the vibration alerts. Even in these very adverse temperature conditions, the L3-X operated safely and predictably.

My gut tells me the L3-x might outperform the Boosted boards for riders up to 175 pounds.  That’s just a feeling.  The snow fell very soon after I unboxed the L3-x.

The new PU wheels are awesome.  The vibration is very low. They seem very durable.

The switch also functions differently.  You need to push it for 3 seconds in order to power down.  I believe this will prevent the power downs that some of you might have experienced with the V2, V3, & V4 after hitting a bump or crack in the road. I think the bump related power outs on the old Landwheels were as a result of the bump triggering the power switch.

The new L3-x battery has higher capacity.  I think this is mostly as a result of a better BMS that allows a deeper charge.

It’s my impression that production line Landwheels are still 1 – 3 weeks out. I’m hoping to see some L3-X units go out to some beta testers in California & Neatherlands so that they can test range and durability and make more comparisons with Raptors, Boosted Boards and Carvons.  Stay tuned.

Dave:
More is now known about the new L3-X batteries.  They have more capacity and range and a better BMS and require a different charging base but operate on the same power supply.  V4 batteries work in the L3-x but the range would be limited.

I suspect L3-x batteries would work in the V4 drives.  The peak voltage on a fresh charge is the same 42.5 volts.

So, if you needed a new battery, you would not need to toss the drive.

Mike is correct.  The video has been out there for months.  I've seen it before.  Its a V3 or V4 Landwheel.  It's not a V3-X.  I reposted that Video a month ago inside the private beta-tester forum. 

The V3-X production units will start shipping this Friday I'm told.  The first four will go to 3 beta testers in California and one in the neatherlands.  I recieved a pre-production prototype in time to ride it for a few hours before the roads in Ottawa Canada got covered in snow and salt.  Based on the little time I had with it on the road, its fantastic. At first glance appear to have solved every single problem that there was with the V3/V4. I can't comment on range and durability becasue winter conditions interupted those tests. 

The next 4 beta testers will be able to perform range and durabilty tests.

Like I said in my earlier post, my son also rode the V3-X.  For him, it out accellerates, out brakes and far exceeds the top speed of a G2 bosted board. We have it mounted on a Flex 1 Deck.  My son prefers it by far to our G1 & G2 boosted board.

I'll post some indoor pictures in a few hours after my cell phone battery charges up.

L3-x pictures:

Note that I have mounted an old V2 Battery on the front to power a 30 volt 1300 lumen headlight.  The risers are my own custom 1/2 inch vibration absorbing rubber blocks. They sandwich the deck. My knees love it.

The deck is a 42 inch Loaded Flex 1 Vanguard.  We like it much more than the 38 inch Flex 3 that comes with the Boosted Board.

Looks awesome! The only other board I own is a dual drive Benchwheel that I bought a few years ago. Pretty reliable so far, but acceleration is paltry. When I receive the landwheel drive I'll do a side by side video once I get a chance to ride it for a bit. Super stoked!

Hi everyone , I would like to get your comments on this. I bought the land wheel long time ago and received the  V3 which had the breaks issue. I am in contact with one of the sales people and they are trying to make me pay around 100$ for them to ship a new version to me. Is this the case with everyone who had an issue with an old version ? and do you pay it? or are they trying to get the most out of my pocket?

Here's is the inside. It's possible to fit 10 18650's in there if I remember correctly. It wouldn't be a good idea as you'd loose half the capacity and discharge rate.

Hello Everyone, 

This is Jason, glad to have this opportunity to communicate with you guys here. 

The motor sound when the L3-X turns on.

This is the sound of FOC standby current. It’s similar to the idle speed sound when the car starts, the voice is not big, but can be heard in the quiet space. It’s unique designed in our circuit board and won’t cause any malfunction problems. We can use the software to cancel it, but it will affect the response time of acceleration and braking. If this sound bother you guys, we will try to cancel it.

OK! I received the L3-X (V5) unit today, and immediately bolted it onto a brand new Loaded Fattail deck. I noticed that using just the tools provided in the box, it can actually be quite awkward to put on the back truck since the hangar cannot easily be removed and moved aside to mount the baseplate. I was able to do this with the front truck, which made using the skate tool a breeze, but the skate tool cannot get to the front bolts while the truck is fully assembled. Moving on. I got the board assembled, waited for the battery to fully charge for a little under two hours. Time for the first ride- here are some observations.
1) The remote is fantastic- The acceleration curve is nice and smooth and very well adjusted, and has a braking curve that matches well. Although the "braking zone" on remote is very small, it is still very easy to brake in a controlled manner, and to a complete stop (even on a downhill). I know that braking was an issue on the V4, but in my opinion, the braking on this unit is just about perfect. I like that I can slam on the brakes completely and It will not throw me from the board. I believe this is the best implementation of brakes on e-boards.  
2) Power- this thing is no slouch. The acceleration curve is well designed which means that it's almost difficult to have the board shoot out from under you like some other boards do. That being said, this drive will get you up to speed very about as quickly as you would ever want it to. I usually give my boards a kick push before starting to engage the throttle, but starting from a standstill on this board is no problem at all and is also very smooth. I rode on a flat bike path tonight, and got up to 25 mph and felt completely in control. I spent most of the time cruising just below 20 mph, and it felt fantastic. I will include photos of my garmin watch, which I used to track the stats on this ride. 
3) Battery- a large part of what got me excited about this board was the swappable battery. I knew the range would not be enormous, but I am slightly disappointed. I had guessed that I would go 5 miles on a single charge, but I only got to 4 miles flat. **DISCLAIMER** there are a few factors to take into account her that I should mention- first of all, this is the first time I am using the battery, and the range is said to improve after a few charge cycles. Second- it was below zero tonight, and there was definitely some wind. Combined, I understand that these factors could have severely impacted my range. I hope this gets better, but even so, I will be ordering extra batteries soon. 
4) Everything else- Overall I love this thing. It's fast, it's fast enough to get me smiling like an idiot, and does so with the polish and feel of something much more expensive (like a boosted board). It helps that I put it on s very nice deck, but I have to hand it to @Landwheel, they really crushed it on this one in my opinion. The thicker urethane/larger wheels is a game changer. This ride is incredibly smooth and takes pebbles/gaps in the pavement (of which there are plenty where I ride) like a champ. Although I can't say anything in terms of long term reliability or durability, this thing feels solid, and so far I'm blown away. AWESOME.

TL;DR
Top Speed: 25mph confirmed
Range: 4 miles- take this with a grain of salt, my testing conditions were poor
Charge Time: just under two hours
Overall: dope.
Here Are some photos

you can just barely see the rear corners of the drive poking out on either side of the deck at the back. overall a solid fit.

Sounds great. Nice to know that they fixed all those issues. Now it is a question of reliability. Only time will tell... Man, but 4 miles only? Even if it was 5 miles, it's almost nothing! How much is a spare battery for that? I'm also interested in getting the L5-X but knowing that, that it has a very short range, I don't feel to get one yet unfortunately. Meepo board has a much longer range for the same price per example, right? Please keep us updated. Thank you for your review!

I’m most likely going to get two extra batteries, which will cost about 230 USD total shipped to me. Even though this all sounds expensive, i would say that having ridden a meepo board and this, they are not in the same league. The Landwheel is incredible. I think with better conditions / more charge cycles, 3 battery packs will get me close to 15 miles, which is further than any of my rides has ever been.

Added miles, a standard pack will generate so much hub motor heat but adding more miles(swapping batteries) might show different results than if you rode a single pack, like a substantial spike in heat after swappping the battery once

I don't currently have any extra batteries, so I don't know if they heat up all that much. From what I can tell (although I am in very cold wether at the moment) these get just barely warm to the touch after pushing it hard without stopping until the battery pack wears out. I don't think heat will be an issue with these. Rode it again today, and taught my girlfriend to ride it. She has some skateboarding experience and no e-boarding experience, but after about 5 minutes of riding the board up and down a hill, she was cruising on fast mode at about 18 mph no problem and felt confident and in control. Clearly @Landwheel have been doing some good work because I've never seen anyone pick up riding an electric longboard so quickly. now if only I could ride it for more that 4-5 miles at a time.... I really need to get my hands on those batteries.

@Thelol182 I will start with a old battery next time and see how long that goes before putting in the new one. 

As far as the rest of the drive goes. No issues. Just remember that it is NOT waterproof or resistant no matter what they say. I can see where all the dust enters the battery are so water will likely to the same. Problem is not their circuit board as it’s sealed better. But the battery terminal will get water eventually. So just stay away from water if you value you investment

Can confirm that this board does not like water. I was impatient and rode on wet pavement. I was very lucky that my board id not short circuit. While the motors themselves are pretty much completely sealed, the battery/esc compartment has no waterproofing whatsoever. I have taken the whole thing apart (not all the way into the motors, i'll wait a bit before doing that)  and sealed the compartment with silicone in hopes that at least if I happen to go over a wet spot/puddle my board won't short out. It seems to work pretty well because I've noticed that considerably less dust makes its way around the battery when I take it out. If there is interest, I can post some photos of the bare hub motors and what the ESC looks like. 

In other news- I was pretty blown away this week when I took this thing up a hill I was certain it could not climb. Although it slowed down quite a bit, this hill is pretty long and gets extra steep right at the top and I was able to to take the board all the way up. twice. breaking going down the same hill worked well too. I took it up a much longer hill that is not as steep, and it made it up that one too. The key to making it up hills with this drive system is different than with my "Jank Tank" single motor belt driven system where I can just floor it at full throttle. Using the Landwheel, it is important to keep it about 3/4 of the way on the throttle, and to not go full throttle- If you do, the battery gets strained too much and the board auto shuts off as it senses the voltage drop and thinks the battery is dead. When the board shuts off the brake is engaged, so you just slow down. Nothing scary like no brakes or braking too hard. Overall, I'm still stoked on this this drive system. I've been using it to get from the train station to work every day for the past week, but it snowed today which means riding it more will have to be delayed until the roads are cleared and dry. I am expected to get two more batteries on the 26th, so I should be able to get some more serious distance out of my board.

one last thing- it does seem like the range is getting better after a few charge cycles- I'm getting closer to 5 miles (always on fast mode, usually going about 15-20 mph)
```

I assume all electronic are not waterproof/resistant. Even if it is. Silicone and rubber seals may break after aging, vibration, temperature changes. 

Seeing the dust marks between the battery the it’s enclousre shows s the air flow...which is basically the water flow if it’s water from puddles. Probably no big issues with a wet spot here and there but it’s always a risk 

Lastly you have to realize that if water gets into the bearings and rust it will be hard or impossible to change.

 Hi there, the range on my skateboard is about 11km and I own 2 batteries (11km each). I'm trying to get more batteries but they are expensive to ship to Australia. I was wondering if you know a good supplier?

I'm ordering my batteries straight from Landwheel on alibaba. Two of them Shipped to the US cost 230 USD, which I think is a fair price considering that a single extra battery from companies like Inboard cost 250 USD a pop. It's not exactly cheap, but I'm not willing to take any risks trying to buy them from an-off brand/ no name supplier just to save a couple bucks up front. If I were you I would just pay the price Landwheel is asking for just because their batteries are reliable, they are a known company/supplier, and have very good customer support which means you won't be disappointed or ripped off. How much are batteries shipped to Australia? I can't imagine it's all that much more expensive than shipping them to the US?

Ordered my landwheel drive yesterday. Now I need a board to mount it on. I was looking at this NKD Ghost Rider because if the drive end up not working I can just put the trucks back on. DO you guys think the landwheel will fit on it?

Start watching this video at the 4:40 mark. 

Cold is definitely not good for batteries. Not sure why the Boosted’s 123 were fine by LiPo weren’t. 

But overall very good results from someone who has ridden many boards.

Yeah, I have seen the video from FabTra about the Landwheel, it looks like that has it all but unfortunately I did not get it why the board shut down during the rides, with both batterys on a hill... Was it the cold weather the main reason? I really don't know... He wasn't clear about it also. So, the doubt will be on spot in my opinion. I would like the Landwheel would pronounce about it.

Did you watch THIS video? The beginning of it was the battery failure part on a different day that was colder and he tried it ahhh when it was on a slightly warmer day. 

From my knowledge, batteries do not perform well in the cold or if it’s left in the cold. I’ve had my phone on a magnetic mount on the A/C car vent in the summer and the battery drains 50-60% after an hour because of the cold air.

He wasn’t the owner of that Boosted board in the video, so my assumption would be the Boosted came from a warm house, and the Landwheel came from Fabian’s car that sat in the cold for a day or two which depleted the battery. This is probably why the Boosted didn’t fail as cold affects all batteries negatively. 

Luckily I live in Southern California. Not really ever cold enough to happen to me

What he mentioned was concave. I think you have that mistaken with camber. I have a Boosted as well as the Loaded Flex 3 deck. They have camber and no concave which is what LW copies.

radial is just a TYPE of concave. Concave is a general term for curvature along the width of the deck. It helps with control in turns as well as the feel of a board under your feet. The camber helps with absorbing vibration<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/c/ec13be392f55e239b5d5cbef6eb6c16c90cbb892.png" width="250" height="178">

So I've been in Florida with the family for the past week and had a chance for my first long range test.  I rode on very rough roads/sidewalks with a lot of stop and go.  I tested the L3-x with  two L3-X batteries wired in parallell.  Others were getting 4.2 miles of range on 1 L3-x battery.  As I suspected, I got better than 8.4 miles.

Instead, I got 10 miles of range.  I ran the batteries down to nothing which may have been a mistake.  One of my two L3-x batteries is down to 33 volts and won't trigger the charger to go in to charging mode.  No problems with the second L3-x battery.  The one with the problem is the white Prototype that I recieved prior to the L3-x production run started.

I'm hoping the battery recoves enough overnight to take a charge.  I've tried bosting the malfunctioning battery a few times by plugging it into the same dual set-up board with a fully charged battery.  I can tell it is sucking up current from the second battery becasue after a few minutes the source battery is depleted enough to go back on the charger and  triggers the red charging light.

I'll try again tomorrow to see if the battery recovers and may try boosting the battery a few more times to try to get it above 33 volts.

I'm open to any suggestions.

Has anyonw else tried a dual battery set-up with the L3-x?  DevoCut?  Technotron?

Anyway, the good news is that the 10 mile dual battery range is impressive for a stop and go run with  tonnes of braking at dozens of intersections and scores of large sidewalk pot holes.

The Acceleration and braking were smooth and "fool proof"  There was no way to over accellerate or over brake.  I have an injured knee so I in consideraton of the poor sidewalk/road condition, I tried to keep the speed very slow. 

Even still, my GPS says I hit 19 mph.  The large wheels did a great job of absorbing road imperfections.  Mounted on my Flex1 board the ride was incredibly smooth despite the horrible surface I was riding on.

While the Acceleration is not anywhere close to boosted board, I've actually learned to appreciate that.  I'm starting to apperciate the option to move my thumb to full throttle and let the landwheel modulate a nice smooth acceleration curve.

Same thing for braking.  I could definitely stop 1 - 2 car lengths sooner on my boosted boards, but I've learned to appreciate how the landwheel makes it impossible for me to make a mistake that could throw me off balance.  I've got a miniscus tear right now that's affected my balance.  I'm actually way more comfortable on the landwheel than on my boosted boards.  We've been in Florida for a week and I all of my riding has been on the Landwheel or my onewheel.  The boosted boards have not come out of the RV storage bins.

I've taken lots of video to edit together a review.  I hope to get some drone footage before the holidays are over.

I saw the Fabian Video.  Its no surprise that the cold weather tests did not go well.  The new Landwheel ESC does a lot of thinking to keep the battery above critical voltage.  His batteries were frozen in the trunk of his car befroe he started.

Over all, it was a very positive review.  He says he hit 45 kph which is pretty darn fast.  I won't be taking mine up to that speed.

Fabian also did a great job of reviewing the best features of the Landwheel.  Easy to swap wheels and batteries,  buttery smooth brakes, easy to swap to a different board, More reliable and better priced than mellow boards.

I think the Fabian review will work out well for Landwheel.

Everyone talking about the swappable battery and you get a better range. What's the point of having a battery that do only 5 miles/8km where other competitors can do way more and you have to carry 2 or 3 batteries.
And these batteries are not light in weight.
Agree on the braking of the landwheel very smooth and way better than the evovle down hill, the remote also is awesome better again than the old evolve remote (they released a new one and apparently it's awesome and have a dead man switch). 
Speed wise it is fast ... and to be able to custom your board it's great.
For me the negative of this board is the range, the tires are a bit too soft they do break on rough surface. I have not enquire any issue with the electric so far so touch wood!! 
This is what I think of the landwheel

I do agree with your comment on it being lame to carry three batteries to get the range some other board can do with one. That’s the hardest thing for me with this board since all my other board get around or over 20 miles (except Boosted)

The thing is, Landwheel, like many esk8s came about due to the popularity of Boosted which advertised 7 mile of range ON ECO so I get about 4 on Pro which is the only mode I use. LW probably used that as a starting point in their design. Just with that fact, slapping the Landwheel on a Flex 3, I get a board that is comparable to a Boosted Board in terms of ride quality and range. But not in quality as Boosted can take a beating and still be reliable. 

Now that Landwheel has gotten the ESC to perform well, I think a new design would be best for their next drive system, by that I mean a new unit where we will no longer expect a replacement unit as the L3x seems to finally perform as promised/advertised 2/3 years ago. As long as this drive works for one year, then they will no longer the responsibility to stand behind their warranty with replacements. 

The original drives came with 99wh batteries which once again matches the Boosted and would be allowable on flights. They have move away from that flight allowability and increased the battery past the 100wh flight limit in the recent 3 iterations, so making a long/wider battery should no long be a question. Just make a larger battery and battery compartment to increase range. 

Lastly an improvement I’m thinking about and not sure possible is... can the BMS be moved out of the battery? Like put it in the charger or in their drive unit? That way the batteries have more room for extra cells thus more range per battery.

Ive been following this post since sometime ago. 
I really think Landwheel is taking the right direction to produce a quality product by listening the riders opinions and accepting their improvements suggestions. BUT, at least for me, their electric skateboards still seat behind in terms of quality and reliability in comparison to other boards of the same and even low price. A 2018 electric skateboard with only 4/5 miles of range it's disappointing and for most people isn't enough for their daily commute. 
I know Boosted Boards are a much more expensive brand that also possess a very short range and like Landwheel I don't consider them a good deal. 
I possess a Kooboard from Koowheel, which had some problems in the hub motors and bearings, and after all I still consider them a better option for the price.
Of course the capacity to choose the deck and attach the Landwheel drive is a plus but the problems don't worth it...

Don't forget the evolve ... The GT had a few issues but they listened and care for their customers and now gtx is one of the best on the market with an awesome customer service. 
Landwheel needs to treat the v5 as a new beginning after all the issues they had in the past. The v5 is not bad, I think it is just us customers who try to compare among the other board on the market. Now when it comes to accessories it is incredible how for just 2 batteries and a couple of tires including shipping the price is as much as the price of their drive. 
The more they make their existing customer happy the more sales they will get as it's us (customers) who sell their board from either mouth to mouth or online forums. 
I have check every reviews on the net and everyone was saying the same thing about the landwheel, "they are not good enough" but I'm sure most of them do not owe the v5 it's their experience from previous models or they have read them off the net ... 
We get frustrated with landwheel because they sell a mid range product with high end price when it comes to accessories.

So lots of posters are commenting on the range and the weight of the batteries.  These comments are fair.  However, everythin is a trade-off.

Boosted board has 7 mile range but thier batteries cost $500 for a spare.  YOu can pre-order an extended range if you buy a G2 at the same time.  However, I've been waiting for almost 2 years for my extended range battery.  Still love my boosted boards.

One Landwheel battery gets just over half the range of a boosted board battery but the batteries are cheap -- Under $200.  So with 2 batteries you exceed the boosted board range and the spare batteries are affordable and available. Yes the Lipo's are heavier and with significanly less range than Lion.  That's the trade-off.

We can suggest a LION option for Landwheel.  Its a good suggestion. But those batteries are going to cost a whole lot more than the LIPO's. They may cost so much more that no one will be wililng to buy them.

On the Wheels.  I weigh 230lbs and I've been hitting a lot of gravel.  The PU is surviving very well.

I've networked 2 L3-x batteries together for a 10 mile range.  That's pretty good for a 230 pound rider on a route that included a lot of intersections, pot holes and braking and speed changes with very little coasting.

I've been in Florida for almost 2 weeks with 2 boosted boards, 2 onewheels and 2 Landwheels.  The dual battery Landwheel on a Flex1 deck has been riden the most becasue of the range and how well it absorbs poor quality sidewalks, and roads.  The onewheels have been riden almost as much because they charge up so fast.  I can ride 2 miles to Home Depot, Charge it up in the store in 10 minutes and ride back to the RV camp on a full battery without worrying about exhausitng the 5 - 7 mile range.

Boosted boards have been mostly stored in the RV.  They lack the range for the 10 mile round trips and the shorter trips are more comfortable and more manuverable on a one wheel.

The Landwheel does not match the accellration and brake strength of the boosted board.  However, I've grown to enjoy the landwheel accelleration and braking.  Its fool proof.  I'have a miniscus tear and my balance is off.  On the Landwheel, I can't make a mistake that would throw me off.

Everything is a trade-off.  Sometimes less is more.  Less range is more range if you have two batteries that you can afford.  Less accelleration can be more fun if you get to top speed a nice pace that is super safe and smooth. Less powerful brakes can also be more.  My landwheel brakes across sand and gravel patches without spinning out like I'm pretty sure would have happened on my boosted boards

LiPos arent heavier than Lions...for the same weight you get more discharge and capacity from LiPo than Lion :) Boosted uses LiFePO4 batteries (in standard battery pack) which have the worst specs in terms of weigh and capacity compared to lions and lipos, but their advantage is that they can take much more charge cycles, output more amps and they are safer :)

And yeah I undestand your opinion, everyone prefers different board...But if I had landwheel or any other chineese board I would be afraid that it will break after some time, thats something that doesnt happen to boosted.

Yes, I agree.  Only time will tell if the landwheels are durable. Everyone likes different boards for different reasons which is why many of us own multiple boards.  I too appreciate the boosted board quality and reliability which is why I own 2. The same is true of my 2 onewheels. I'm hoping for good durability from the landwheel because there is a lot that I like about them also.  Specifically, I get to choose the length and flex of the board to fit my weight and stance.  Also, I get to choose my own maximum range, with affordable spares.

One more Land wheel positive is that when mounted on a Flex 1 board, it tows behind nicely on two wheels.  Boosted board does not do that without me crouching over.  So if I ride to a store, the landwheel becomes almost weightless.  This positive is a function of the taller wheels and 4 inches of extra length that I get from my own choice of deck.

Stick with it and you will master it.  You are a heavier rider so you likely need to pump up the tire.  They ship them out inflated for lighter riders.  If the tire is under inflated for your weight the contact patch will be too fat and distorted, especially at higher speeds.  The tires will wear quickly and the range will  be very short.

Check the specs for max tire pressure then pump it up to the max.

Next, practice in your driveway with two pilons.  Make the tightest curve possible at each pilon until you can do a 1.5 foot radius turn. Practice turns in both directions.

Next go to a socer field and practice bige figure eights.  The trick is to let the board correct itself and just let your ankles float on top.  The big fat tire wants to lay flat so when you hit a lob sided pot hole, just let your ankles float with it.

As for dismounting, I have both the one wheel and the one wheel plus.  I don't like the new foot sensor on the one wheel plus.  The old one was better.  Anyway, you probably know this but there are three ways to get off.  

1) lift your heel and stand on your tip toe on the sensor pad while getting ready to shift weight to the rear paddle when the balance cuts out.
2) Lift your insole on the sensor pad so that the outer edge of your shoe tred is standing on edge.
3 Jump off with both feet and run away so you don't get whacked on the heels.

Tips.  Never ride wiht the sensor pad at the rear.  If you hit a bump, your rear foot will bounce off the sensor.  the front pdel will drop.  Your front foot will slide off the front.  Then your rear foot will land backon the paddle and the one wheel will smash into your front ankle and keep on plowing until you jump off the rear paddle.  I speak from experience.  Its super painful and can have lasting effects on your ankle.  So always ride with the sensor at the front.

Their esc uses 3.5mm bullets. 

The problem I see is clearance of the motor mount and motor. The way this is designed. You will need the rear mount. 

Also the stock truck on these have four threaded holes that is used to mount it to the aluminum alloy plate of the unit. So keep in mind it’s a little different if you plan to on moving from one deck to another as your mod would become detached once the four hardwares are removed

Hey guys long time no speak. I was so happy that the new version of the landwheel actually worked and the breaking was better etc.

But after day one of using it the casing literally just fell off with the screws flying everywhere. No idea how this happened or if I hit a rock. Just wondering if it happened to anyone else. Landwheel said it wasn't screwed tight enough. Firstly not sure if that is the cause, but I worry about future users if it was the cause.

So far three people including myself saw this problem. What is the condition of the drive after the casing split open? This is a known issue that Landwheel has resolved now. I believe because the battery is heavier now so the screws that held the metal plate to the plastic case is not long enough to take the vibration and weight 

@Landwheel can send you the replacement screws of you can just do it yourself for under $2. 

This is what I used. Just take off the drive. Peel back the rubber pad from the battery end. Once you expose the 7 black screws you can stop as those are the only ones that needs to be swapped

Mike's fix worked brilliantly, however.  I did opt for softer brass screws + purple Loctite (low strength).  Just remember to use hand tools and your human torque spidey sense when tightening plastic to metal.  

Happy to report both units are solid as a rock, now (we bought two v5's and I'm looking for a 3rd that I can splice into an AWD). :cowboy_hat_face:

Thanks @Mikenopolis!

The cover fell off and they sent me a replacement with the screws. but my concern is there is a loose wire I am not sure what to do about.

@mbkahn3 Yeah, that's just the antenna wire. If you look at the plastic housing that came off, there is a thin sticker PCB on it, see if you can solder it back on. 

If you can't, the better thing to do is strip about 31mm of the insulation to expose the wire, then tuck it in under that panel (just remove those 6 screws), make sure the bare wire doesn't touch metal.

Have a read of this that explains 2.4Ghz antenna length

I have yet to get an answer from Jason. I emailed him on the 23rd of December.
And now after a long while I will be shipping back the v4 with the metalplate of v5 they sent me...

So far I would NEVER recommend Landhweel.
Hopefully that will change but i really doubt it.

By the looks of it I'm gonna be riding V1 board with orange wheels but V5 esc.
I bet that the panel gonna hit the ground and crack.
I really don't like their support at all atm.

[/quote]

The buzzing sound may be vibration between the battery and the socket (this also happened on the Mellow).  

You may wish to try placing a little piece of foam between the removable battery and the frame and see if that works:

https://www.amazon.com/Isolate-Sorbothane-Vibration-Isolation-Circular/dp/B0042U8P9C/ref=lp_3031799011_1_1?srs=3031799011&ie=UTF8&qid=1517414061&sr=8-1

I like Sorbothane because it doesn't move.  Drawback is weight so I'd suggest using it sparingly.

Hope this helps!

Partly due to concerns over the board and partly due to not being the best skater I only just tried going full speed when the road was pretty empty late at night. Once I was close to full speed it was shaking a lot! Felt like I was not in control and was seconds away from crashing. 

Has anyone else experienced this?

What exactly was shaking? or was is speed wobble? the unit or the entire board? I had an experience with the old V3 where it was shaking me so bad my eyes wasn't able to even focus. I think THAT problem for me was uneven wheels, turn your board upside down and push the throttle slowly, does the wheel wobble?

This is perfectly normal (and can be improved upon with training and minor equipment).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMauq_6kti8

For 'acoustic' skateboarding you need to position your weight towards the front of the board and foot brake.

RGK in CO demonstrating a "footbreak" lesson to manage out of a death wobble: 

https://youtu.be/9OMARKuPRx0

For the Landwheel, I swapped out soft parts immediately and then did so again after I discovered @Alphamail's KranK formula.  It truly makes a big, big difference in feel (boardfeel begins in the foot and ends in the pivot cup).

I'd ask @Alphamail what he suggests.  Maybe Landwheel could offer it as an official upgrade or something - it's night and day over OEM.  Hope this helps.

This is from our website:  KranK™  Formula:  Performance Under Pressure 
Our highest rebound formula to date, KranK is designed specifically to change under pressure and is controlled by the amount of clamp pressure you subject it to when tightening the King Pin nut!  The effective range of control is from barely snug for the loosest feel to 2 full turns for the tightest feel.  KranK will turn the same or less than the same durometer of other brands which is also a departure from APS and WFB.  As for washers, flat washers work great with this compound, but for the greatest control and range of this performance feature, use cupped, precision flat or precision cupped washers.

Boardfeel is very personal.  You know it when you feel it, so here's my take on it:

We've all been kids at a store where we spent mamaw's quarters at one of those [spoiler]child consumerist training tools[/spoiler] toy vending machines that spit out bouncy rubber balls, right.

Remember that kind of heavier one you barely bounced - and it could hit the ceiling?  That's kind of how KranK feels.

To be specific, KranK gives me the confidence that I can lean _way_ deeper on shorter wheelbase boards, like my BuddyBuddy Cruiser and Penny 27".  I think this is because KranK snaps back to attention faster than anything not-a-Hamboards-HST-with-pro-silver-springs.

Springs on a rigid deck feel like I'm surfing the garage door, however - I think springs need a next-gen deck like Trampa.  That's the genius of @Frank's design and why I only skate Trampa at speed downtown on a @Kaly that'll outshoot me.

Where I think Riptide KranK 87a really, truly shines is on both 22" and 27" Penny cruisers.  Straight up makes them pump faster, making the 22" especially easier to ride and way more forgiving.

No idea. The receiver can be removed and probably wired up to other boards. But when bins the remote we had to use the power button from the LW so not sure if that is needed

Does anyone here have ANY idea where I can find/make a charging dock for my L3-X battery? I have the charger cord itself, but managed to lose the dock. I've spent hours searching and haven't been able to find anything online in regards to a replacement charger.

Any help would be greatly appreciated

They sell under different names, but this is the same.

I think you should contact the store where you purchased LANDWHEEL.

Even if the charger is connected, the LED will not be charged while remaining green.

Hi guys 

Hopefully, someone could advise me on this issue.
So, I was riding around and at some point, I made a slow turn in which the wheel made a small impact on an edge of the curb.

Since then, in this hub motor, the rattle is presented.

Took it apart checked two bearing and one of them seems to not be aligned. Swap for a new bearing, unfortunately, nothing has changed.

In the video attached, you can hear and see what happens 
I really would like to sort this out and jump back to riding it.

The easiest thing to do would be to find a female DC connector in an eletronics parts store. You want one that fits the charger cord.  Drill a hole in the plastic enclosure of the landwheel drive and mount the Female connector.  Finally, solder positive and negative wires between the Female DC connector and the battery terminals.  Check the polarity with a multi meter but in theory red should be positive and black should be negative.  I say check becasue the red and black are reversed inside the L3-x battery.  But I don't think they are ever reversed inside the  drive chasis.

Now if its an L3-x you want to connect the charging wires to the battery terminal that is disconnected from all wires.  I forget if thats a negative or a positive terminal...but one of the terminals is isolated from the ESC.  thats the charging terminal. 

Just for clarification the V4  had both negative terminals connected to each other and both positive terminals connected to each other.  The L3-x was different.  On of the four terminals was isolated by grinding away the printed circuit board that holds the four terminals.  The reason this was done was to allow regenerative current to bypass the BMS.  That was important becasue if the BMS disconnected the battery from the ESC to prevent over charging, the ESC would pop because the regen current had no where to go.  

So you don't want to wire the charger up to the red and black wires that power the ESC becasue that would connect the charging brick in a way that would bipass the BMS.  So the charging brick would never get a signal that the battery was full.

Understand?
