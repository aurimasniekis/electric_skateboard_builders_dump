 Hi Guys. I am kind of a newb, but Me and another more seasoned esk8er, are trying to build some boards to sell, basicly an excuse to build esk8! The boards can be customized, and prices are negociatable. It you are interested, please PM me. I am in The San Francisco Bay Area, sand it would save shipping costs if you were near bye. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and please consider buying.

It's a generous offer, considering you have absolutely no idea what's involved.

I am a total newb, and my first build was a hub motored board. I am planning to use a sk3, 192 kv motor, and I was wondering would my esc give the motor  a bottleneck? Thank for helping a newb like me.

Just a comment but if you are actually trying to sell something, it may be a good idea to at least read through your post and correct the basic spelling errors/grammar. 

It makes it seem like you are actually serious.  Js :sunglasses:

Hey mate I've been here for a while but I'm not very good at building things. I am looking for a board that can do about 45km/h with a range of 20km. I was thinking a 10s3p 30q pack with dual sk3 192kV motors and torqueboard 218 trucks. I don't know about the deck and anything else tho I guess Vesc would be good, maybe maytech ones or if you can't get those I would like to use some 200a boat escs from eBay. Do you think you could build this for me, I would be willing to pay $2000. Oh and who is the other guy building it with you?

Edit: do you think you would be able to make it friction drive? I think that would be super efficient

its mostly the other guy who would prefer to stay anynomous.  I'm just a ghost writer!:rofl:. The idea was we would build for people who know what they want but may not have the time.

In order to be a writer, you need to be good at spelling and grammar.  It's a prerequisite for the job.

Typically nobody buys from folks who are anonymous and don't provide photos or have any other customers.

Sid, Sid, Sid.


You're going to have to close the business down. 
I think there are some basic things presented here that are um.. outside your capabilities.

@moderator can we close this thread is getting really sketchy... look Alex kinda of s***t 

I suggest that when @sid1 has more info, and the other can confirm his identity the thread could be open up again.
