Hiya i am new to the forums my plan is to try upgrading a cheap Backfire Clone board's ESC to VESC since i've seen it done in a video on youtube by Dr Circuit i believe he is a member of the forums also, i am wondering if anyone else has tried it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcECQVdFO2E and where maybe i can get spare wheels  compatiable with these boards or any other parts i am buying the board for about 450$ and i belive VESCs go around 100$+?

I just made a tutorial "step by step" to replace the ESC by a VESC, inspired by Dr circuit's video.
Made by a noob, for the noobs :slight_smile:
