This was not full throttle, as i wasnt quite enough used to the board to push the throttle all the way. More to come!

I wonder how fast it could go if i put on @onloop â€˜s R2 hubs and configured the VESCs for them.....

IRL Specs:

I weigh 150 lbs, and achiever a top speed of 27mph on flat ground, and a range of 18 miles. uses dual VESCs with 800w hubs. Theyre soon offering belt drive option and higher-end hubs. 25r 10s2p battery



I will be including a standstill->full throttle acceleration and speed test in the future!

Cool. I think you meant 18miles* What does the 25r mean? I made mine own esk8 too but I was too pussy to ride full throttle. My friends got a max speed of 31mph who weighs 140 lbs and my most efficient run was 20miles on 12s 5ah(around 14~mph)  How is it that I use one 3kw motor yet you achieved a speed just lower than mine with just 1.6kw?

Watts do not determine speed they determine power. Speed is determined by the motors kV, battery voltage, wheel size and gear ratio
