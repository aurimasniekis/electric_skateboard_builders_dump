Just recently picked up this 'broken' Acton S2 for 100 bucks!

Back on topic.

I've always wanted a small, inexpensive shopping mall board for cruising around town. This came up on the Sydney Esk8 facebook group and I couldn't resist!

It also came with an extra set of dual hubs with brand new PU sleeves directly from Acton, obviously down the road I'd like to rebuild this into a 4WD cruiser.

Pics!

Fuck, the wires are so damn tiny! I'm guessing max 2A per phase wire :rofl:

Dusty as shit!

The issue is that the board doesn't latch onto the on position when the button is pushed, the leds light up only whilst the button is held down, Others on reddit have had the same problem. I've held down the tiny surface mount button on the esc which doesn't solve the issue. 

The battery seems fine and reads at 38.7v (10s battery). I'll soon tear down the whole thing and try and identify what's wrong.

Most likely I'll end up buying a replacement esc to get it running. Since the dual esc is so generic there is an identical unit on DIYeboard (I know that they're a total scam scrap of mouldy ham sham)

Does anybody know where I can get this esc from a more reputable seller? Or if there are any similar budget esc's to get this running? I've looked at Meepo's website and they seem to have a similar offering.

Can we get more pics of the switch? Make sure it clearly shows the pins on the back.

This could literally just be a case of a faulty switch with a broken latch barb

For sure, I'll post more when I get home. It could just be a faulty switch but I doubt it.

Of it truly is toast, just buy some cheap vescs and call it good. It will be much better

I've got two maytech vescs which have run perfectly, but even a pair of cheap vescs seems overkill for this? The hubs are most likely max 20A each, probably not even that.

Its not about overkill, its how smooth a vesc is. It is infinitely configurable and even has decent resale value.

Of course, my thinking though is that a dual hub esc does not necessarily have to be of shit quality. The myriad of chinese hub boards typically use the hobbywing foc esc which is proven to have good reliability and performance (this is just my opinion, anecdotally speaking. There are obviously many here who would completely disagree).
