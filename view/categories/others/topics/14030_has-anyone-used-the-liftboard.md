Hey Guys, I just picked up my LiftBoard (made by www.goliftboard.com) and i have tons of questions about it, since the  website has absolutely no videos/reviews/etc

Has anyone purchased one of these?

looks alot like the chinese knock-offs of benchwheel boards.

It looks exactly like a benchwheel. But black.

yeah I noticed that, but never been on one of those as well

I'm just wondering if anyone ever tried those and if they had issues with motor spinning automatically after braking?

I have a benchwheel, and I do not have that issue. The board itself is actually pretty good. It's just the parts need some quality control.

there is almost no info on the site, not even a location. so i checked the domain. Ontario Canada.

back to the board, no real info on that either. 50mm motors. htd3 belts, benchwheel mounts and remote. the wheels are oddly skinny!! and board is flat.?

hope you didn't pay much for this....especially if your brakes are having issues :head_bandage:

The feel is nice and acceleration is good.
It is flat and the grip tape is meh
Thankfully I spent only 400 (from a friend) so I'm not too worried. Worse case I'll pop in 2 vescs to improve the control and also swap the controller

If it's like the benchwheel, then the BMS and ESC are one single unit. And the remote will be particular to that unit. What does the remote look like? Tbh, even the specs (top speed and range) are exactly the same as what's quoted for a benchwheel.

I just went and explored the website a bit more. It's definitely a black benchwheel with what looks like thinner wheels and a flat deck.

but only once I break it

Well, mine has been very reliable since I repaired it. And I do know some guys now who have had the board for way longer with zero issues. Luck of the draw I guess. Hope yours is one of the good ones!

let's hope so!

Are your belts really tight? As in, when you manually try to spin the wheel, is there a lot of drag?

Yes they are. I can only just barely push the board with both belts on. It's even enough for me to ride down some hills without brakes.

same. about $400. so ks price of about 6 with shipping is reasonable(if it survives). but retail at 1k? come on.

wow just look at this.
http://shop.actonglobal.com/collections/electric-skateboards/products/blink-board-lite
the old single hub goes for $400, they are letting it go for $200 and still making money(they must).
just get this! I kinda want one for 2.

i just tried the pro mode and when braking it locks the wheels after letting go of the brakes
also, launches randomly even in beginner mode (almost crushed under a truck lol)

this sounds like it could be the remote is just trimed wrong. if its the benchwheel receiver it should be easy to swap out for a regular rxtx, unless they integrated it into the controller but I don't see why they would.

I don't know much about electronics, but while I was searching around to repair mine I came across a few videos that helped me. Search for benchwheel disassembly on YouTube. There's also a thread somewhere in this forum that has a teardown and rebuild of the benchwheel.

Yeah, I heard good things about those boards too. I got the benchwheel mainly because I read that the belt drive is better for climbing hills. And I need to get past 2 big ones on my normal commute.

I know that this thread is old but I just want to say that I bought a liftboard dual from walmart. They were on sale for 450$. I was impressed with the performance. I am 300 pounds and this thing just took off full speed (advertised 18 mph) I measured it with map my bike. I dont know how reliable is it gonna be in the future... but yeah this thing is awesome. As for the range at 8 miles I still had 2 lights on meaning 65%. I was on flat surface the whole time so no idea about slopes...

Hey how are you liking the liftboard?? Thinking about picking one up, but it seems like most of the reviews are from people with their opinions based on their $1500+ boards against a more cost effective board, for a board with near the same power as a boosted and for a third of the cost the liftboard seems pretty cool

The lift board is an electric skateboard advertised as a quote Last Mile vehicle. Now there are two options to this board one is a single motor version the second is a dual motor version. For the sake of this review, I will be reviewing the single motor version. Now as far as the things I like about this board is that it has a very long battery life. It is advertised that it can go 13 miles without a charge. And I can confirm that that is very much true I've gone on many trips without having to charge it. Another thing I do like about the board doesn't speed and color. it has a Sleek all black design with black wheels black deck and black trucks.  and it seems to get me places at a very high speed so I can get anywhere I want and only a short matter of time.
     this board is obviously not perfect. It has its flaws as everything else does. now electric skateboards are very new things so you have to expect some things will not be very functional. For example when it comes to this board and water it doesn't mix if you run it through a puddle you run the risk of having it going to your charging port  thus breaking the poor although this is unlikely I would recommend them providing a charge port cover So water Cannot get into the port while you are  Riding. Also another gripe I do have with this product is that over time the belt will not down over time. Although they do provide an extra belt there are no real instructions on how to install that belt. the last big gripe I have with this product is that it is extremely heavy. It does have a handle to help you carry it although this thing weighs a good  35 lb. So you can imagine if your skateboard dies mid-trip you're going to have to carry this giant heavy board with you which will be very inconvenient. So all-in-all I do recommend this product and the major issues I have with it can obviously be fixed and it's really nothing major in my opinion.

Here's the deal:

I definitely would recommend this board because it is a fun way to get around town. However, if you haven't had a ton of experience on a longboard (non-motor) then I would be extremely careful when riding this machine. It's kind of worrisome because the board is **way** more powerful than advertised. I'm 5'11 and 154lbs, and when I pushed the throttle as far as it could go, the liftboard started to do a mini burnout trying to get some traction. I used a speedometer app on my phone to test the speed, and I was able to reach about 18-19 mph. Keep in mind this is the single motor, not the dual. This board is really awesome but I would be very careful when riding this, because you could seriously injure yourself.

post your review/impressions on reddit.I dont think you will be able to convince people here that a single 8s3p 5055 motor board is powerful ;)


reddit might, tho. people are always lookin for budget boards there

I'll tell you one thing tho ....I have the single version and it's a piece of shit. The remote connection is the worst part of it and second is the motor clamp that rotates on the round truck hanger. Front truck hanger cracked and the wheels have large chunks that come off. Lastly is the ride height. Trucks sit on top of the 36"aluminium battery enclosure and not on the deck so it's just like running a 1 inch spacer block. To top it all off it likes to keep going in neutral. Kinda have to play fidget with it to stop completely . The liftboard has so many problems that it's the reason I have started to build my own boards from this forum ....so Thankyou liftshitzboards

I got the dual motor liftboard about 3 weeks ago.  I really love it, it surpassed all my expectations. Although I must say it is my first e-skateboard so I can't compare to something else.  I had ridden a regular longboard sporadically before.
I also used to ride a 2kw kick scooter I put together myself that goes about 35 mph (12s 20ah lipo).  And a 10 kw ebike (cromotor hub motor, 24s lipo, 24 FET controller) that I never use because is heavy and unpractical.

I've been using the liftboard to commute everyday (5 mile round trip) with no problems.  Acceleration and uphill power is great, it really feels like those little motors put out 1800w as claimed.   The top speed of 18-19 is more than enough in an urban enviroment (Boston/ Cambridge for me), although I wish it went something like 22-25 mph for wide open areas, but then again 18 mph is plenty fast on a board.  

My board is a second generation board (last manufacture run), so the motor mounts are totally redesigned, they are more sturdy, and the belts are completely covered and protected.  

Also very important, the wheels are now 90 mm wheels, instead of the previous 80 mm wheels.     They run great, no need to upgrade as I was planning before I received the board (though it would have 80mm wheels).   

The belts are 225-3M-15  , so they are 15mm wide belts same exact belts as V2 boosted boards.  I believe the previous gen liftboard had 12mm wide belts. 

The pulleys in the wheels are one piece with the wheel, but new wheels cost only $9.99 at their website.

I have not had a single remote disconnect of malfunction since I got it.

I couldn't avoid leaving it in the pouring rain for one full afternoon last week.  Dried it with a cloth after, waited until next day to turn it on, and it runs as new, not problems at all, not even rust anywhere.

I think I will keep this stock for a good while, has plenty of torque and decent speed, and is realiable. And might build my own board later on for more speed just for fun.

The two 50mm motors on this thing are being utilized to its full potential.  After a 2.5 mile ride to work with some good hills and lots of full throttle and stops, I can only old my hand on the motor for about 5 seconds before it starts burning, so the can is heating to close to 80 C I think.  Running more volts or amps on them would make them overheat I think.  ( I weight 180 lb)

I don't notice any drop in power at all after the motors cool down, so there's no irreversible demagnetization of the motor magnets after a beat up.  Like I said the thing runs reliably.

Hope that helps.

PS: The liftboard people were very fast and helpful everytime I emailed them with questions about the board or inquires for parts, highly recommended.

This is my unbiased opinion, I have no connection with liftboard other than having bought one of ebay.

Update on how fast this goes.

I weight 180 lb.

I GPS the speed of this.  Right of a fresh charge, it goes a consistent 21 mph for the first half mile or so, with a Max speed of 22.3 mph.

After one mile or so it drops to a consistent 19 mph for another 2 miles or so. It even goes 19mph with slight uphill inclines.

Didnâ€™t clock after that but my feeling is it does about 16 mph after 4 or so miles.

The motors heat up to 55-60 C measures with an infrared gun at the motor can after 3 miles of heavy continuous use.  Not bad 

At this temperature thereâ€™s a noticeable decrease in torque and speed as the magnets loose some strength at the higher temp.  If you let it cool down the magnet strength bounces back to normal with great torque and power.
