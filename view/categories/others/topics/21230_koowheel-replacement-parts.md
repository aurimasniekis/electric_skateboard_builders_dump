Hi guys,

i am pretty new in the e skating topic. I would like to buy a Koowheel but i dont have too much trust for this brand. I would like to ask if anybody knows where i can get replacement parts for this board? For example if one motor will die could you point me how to buy replacement for that? Thank you.

Is that last picture with the hub motors accurate? Are 6 screws the only thing keeping the urethane on the motor. There doesn't appear to be anything else keeping it locked in place and on the motor. All I could picture was that portion of the wheel with urethane coming off in a hard turn or from a good bump. That can't be right can it?

How works the service in case the board is not working? Do you sell spare parts, how is troubleshooting done?

Hi Ron13

Koowheel offers 2 years EU warranty from their Germany warehouse free of charge including the shipping, usually the process take 7-10 days. 

In our side we have accesories, spares and replacements for out of warranty claims. We are trying to get the service in house for UK but Koowheel preferred to keep all centralised from Germany. We will keep trying...ðŸ˜‰

thats whats funny I'm looking for some really random parts. lol 

I'm looking for an EMPTY enclosure and the rubber around it. as well as the battery cage with the rubber around it as well. 

im trying to prototype something and dont want to use my current board for the parts since they will be destroyed in the process, and it will leave my board unusable.

Hi I have 2 Koowheel and I do not advise these boards after 2 loads one has caught fire because a capacitor is desoldered with vibrations ...![20180610_215606|666x500](upload://2sqxpU0AFD8OFjlAmXNSLOvaaW0.jpg)![20180610_215613|666x500](upload://9ikrNElRmsJMnvEABzyFFh2x7sY.jpg)
and the second starts one engine and blocks the 2nd. at first i was thinking of 1 faulty motor but by reversing the cables i found that the problem comes from the motherboard too.![20180610_192030|666x500](upload://8EFY3JVLirURuHN4W0SkDiDrmKQ.jpg).
The problem seems to be known because the new motherboard is better isolated.
![Screenshot_20180611-082124_Chrome|281x500](upload://dq7qhjyPAygT4X1QYxX1qzS8179.jpg)
and as Koowheel's Tina does not respond to my email the warranty is useless.
the only solution left is to pay to fix the blow I am a little disappointed.

Would anyone know where I can get parts to repair a battery? I need to repair the plug part. The rest of the battery is just fine, it's just the connector.

be VERY careful with the polarity of these plugs when you solder, you actually can plug it in wrong because the trapezoid shape is not too well defined.
