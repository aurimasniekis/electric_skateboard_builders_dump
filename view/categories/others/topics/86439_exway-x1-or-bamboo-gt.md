Question, should I purchase a brand new Exway X1 or second-hand bamboo GT?

Both are around the $1000 AUD mark and am looking to buy a prebuilt.

Thanks for any and all input üëç

Yeah th√© exway is very cool (a new one is coming !)
Evolve could be good if it comes with an at kit too

@nono_fr  The pro is already out but costs a fair bit more.

@Grozniy it's a long story. My Diy build has been out of commission for almost two years and it has literally killed me spending so much money on something that I only got to ride for a week or two üò≠üò≠ 

I miss that feeling so much and just want to ride again!

Down the road I'll part out my old diy and start afresh. But for now I just want to ride again!

I would like to but it's simply out of my budget, the X1 easily goes for under 1000 AU shipped in australia whereas the pro costs over $300 more...

I think the pro is worth it. 50% more battery and future belt upgrade.

Then get X1, it will be new, with warranty and you'll have some fun

Prebuilts have gone a long way since two years ago. They went from death machines to something that you can actually ride comfortably. I would say go with the Exway....Evolve is still what they were two years ago.

@Mikenopolis absolutely they have! My plan is to eventually go all out on a diy with a unity, haya, surfrodz, gear drive build, but for now I have a limited budget and don't have the luxury of spending over 2K on a diy üòÇ

Which brings us to resale value since I'll most likely sell and upgrade to the diy down the road, I'd imagine evolve would have better resale value?

@MasterSpoon I didn't consider purchasing new from evolve! The price does seem quite affordable where I may be willing to spring the extra $$$, especially if the resale value is better.

If I was getting a cheap board to use while a build was down or something I'd be looking at the new backfire board. Its like $600 i think. 

I don't have one, but they seem like a decent deal for the price considering they use 30Q cells and decent trucks. Comes with 97mm wheels too.

You probably also couldn't really go wrong for the money with some of the other cheap boards(Wowgo, Meepo ect..). All of the above brands seem to have sold a lot of units, and most people seem to be happy.

 I think I even saw a meepo deal the other day for like $350. EDIT: close, $389 https://www.meepoboard.com/boards/classic/

Stay away from slim boards that you cannot see where they're hidding the battery. Just imagine the range for such a board :-1:. For large production ones just spill their guts, grab their hardware, drop their electronics (with just few exceptions) and start over with the way you want your dreamed DIY.

Yeah the first gen had some issues, but they are solved.
There are some reviews on youtube about the 4WD.
Im riding for about 1/2 year now without a single issue.

By that logic the Hyper Beast range is trash. It‚Äôs not about where the batteries are but *what* the batteries are. 

The proper way should be to look at reviews across multiple platforms to get a gauge of the boards average performance. By doing so one you can that the exway suffers from short range and voltage sag. The Pro is meant to solve this , but that will take some time to see multi-platform testimonials in regards to it‚Äôs performance.

Keep in mind this is for the OP Getting out of the DIY game , not in.

Thanks for all the replies! I've thought for a long time about this and am now convinced to go through the diy route again! 

I knew that there weren't many positives to write home about with evolve, especially regarding reliability and safety, but initially I was prepared to accept that, however, risking one's safety due to poor design is never good! 

I also didn't want the underwhelming range and performance of the Exway. There are many steep hills around where I live in good ole Sydney and I don't particularly want those to be an issue

I'm now saving up to go all out on an Evo (@Deckoz style) as many others have done due to the excellent deck and fantastic platform. Half of me though wants to go all out on a stealthy Haya and Hummie hubs when they are available, so torn right now üòÖ

I'm confused, why not Metroboard from @isabar ?  It's far better than Exway or Evolve.  Or you could always buy a custom build from @longhairedboy or @psychotiller

The main turnoff to all of those excellent options is the overall cost (including shipping) due to the Aus dollar as well as shipping a complete with Li-ions being a tad risky.

Now I know that Diy (especially the builds that I am looking at) can be just as expensive, if not more so than even the custom builds for sale. However I have already purchased some of the parts needed for a future build (surfrodz rkps, motors etc) and intend to use them! 

Great advice though @b264, if I was starting completely afresh I would more likely consider buying a @longhairedboy or @psychotiller custom.
