Hello,
I'm on a long ride. (8+8 = 16) and my controller won't connect to my board.

Both items turn on.

For a short while my board would beep one lonely beep when off but only if the wheels were turning.

Since I had a long ride, I was walking up the hills and I normally keep the board on but today I started turning everything off when going uphill. 

After one hill the controller wouldn't connect.

On one recent trip my board lost "power" briefly 4 times but it always restarted in about a half second.

Yuneec auto announce for tech support said 65 minute wait so I'm just walking.

Any suggestions?
