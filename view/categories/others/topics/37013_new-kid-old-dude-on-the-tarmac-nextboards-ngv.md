> And after all this time the wait is finally over for every speed-freak out there. Pre-orders start on November 14th, there will only be a limited amount of Nextboards for this first batch so get yours while they last!

not really news bro, seems like there is a NGV thread every week...

Powa-also making big claims: "Behold...the fastest and most powerful electric skateboard on Planet Earth!"

Well, the world record is just a side note. I only care about the board which I think is neat. Little different from others. Time will tell how well it goes. For now is pricey. On the other hand, they are getting away without the crowd funding bull and selling a few boards straight with pre-orders just now at the end of October. Deliveries 1st quarter 2018. Your bet **Cobber**....

You don't see Powa's racing team supporting those claims, whilst NGV attempt was well documented....

yeah, it's cool the first time you see it, I'm just saying it's not really **_news_**

not much diff. from this thread:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-makes-the-ngv-skateboard-able-to-be-the-worlds-fastest-electric-skateboard/34987

or this one:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/interested-in-high-speed-electric-skateboard-tech/34728/

or...

on the otherhand a search for _**POWA**_ though yields "0" so it adds new content to the forum rather than duplicate topics

I explored their site the other day. They developed different truck configurations. A super modern concept...but also pricey. My concern with Powa's truck is the way it holds the deck which seems too fragile and brittle for most people's weight.

NGV kind of look a bit like a one trick pony though. NGV is geared so high you have to kick it to certain speed before it will start. I assume it cogs like hell because of the wind-your-own scorpion motors they most likely have used are heli motors (12N 10P) designed for rotor speed & power/weight, and do not make as much torque (7%) as the average rc plane (or scorpion) motor in 12N 14P config. optimized for torque/ efficiency...
(this is just jargon though from the scorpion site)

Looks like an interesting board to say the least. Really like the lights. Been trying to integrate lights like that for a while, it's not easy.

I'm curious as to how hot the motors will get. They look around the same size of hummies old motors, which for lighter riders (130 ish lb), in 4wd, will not have over heating issues. But for 200 lb ish guys like me, or even heavier guys, I can't imagine heat won't be an issue, especially if they are making the kv so high for high speeds.

My ngv board is finally done and it will be to me either Saturday or Monday, it goes that fast because they use different batteries than most they use 2 22.2v Lipo batteries in their set, and most people want to stay away from lipos due to their "nature" my YouTube will be up soon so stay tuned for updates!

high KV hub motors and heavily modified airplane ESCs running custom firmware coupled with high output lipoly packs. That's basically the secret sauce here. 

Also, making it look like a kaiju weapon makes it even faster.

What's so crazy about their esc?

What they are really doing is they wind their motors to 150 (plus or minus a bit) kv. I'm sure the focbox blows their esc out of the water.

Whats the real point of a board like this? I don't understand why people seem to associate high speed with high power. There's not a lot of correlation. High speed will result in less efficiency and less torque.

It's the kind of board that's cool in certain places and the track, but not really practical most of the time.

[/quote]

They're souped up Flyers with custom home-grown firmware. Some of the components have been replaced, or so it appears, and they've been mated with a custom CNCed heat sink that mounts to the truck base in order to better disseminate heat throughout the truck. Thought i mentioned that. Not a lot of people doing that kind of shit anymore now that we have standardized VESC based ESCs literally everywhere and fucking china shoveling shit out the door. 

Also i'm pretty sure those motors were wound to target 190kv, but i can check on that. 

You are correct in that this is a limited application board. I don't think they're trying to build commuters now. I think they're trying to use everything they find out by going as fast as possible to build a better general purpose board later. That's only my guess. Its not a bad plan. Its not dissimilar from my own.

My philosophy is to ride my boards as hard as possible in the hilliest environment. If you can survive that, it can survive almost any thing. Speed will only be good for making sure their cores and wheels are good.

I don't know how these esc's will perform, but I can't imagine it can do the same amps as a focbox or vesc 6. And with hub motors, lower resistance in the wind (to lower the amount of amps you need for the same torque) is important. Since we can only lower the resistance so much, at some point, we just need to be able to run higher amps to get the power we're after.

If I gave you 4x hummie v4 motors wound to 150 kv and 107mm, with 4x focbox's, you could do 60 + mph with more power than this board, for less than $1500 + $500 for a 120a con battery with a smart bms, so basically 2k (instead of $2700), and you can run 480 motor amps (like I do) and have insane power and speed (instead of just insane speed).

At the end of the day, they are trying to working with rc plane esc's, and probably general bms's. Your paying way more, for lower tech. The best electronics in my mind are the ones custom made for electric skateboards.

It's like me taking 2 motorcycles, and saying hey, I have 4 wheels now, lets make a car... I can make it work, but how will you ever get it to work as well without some hacky stuff that's questionable in the side effects it will have in the long run.
