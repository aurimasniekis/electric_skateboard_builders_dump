Clearance issues.
Hub motors / not much torque?
Bumpy ride with those thin wheels. 

It's probably going to be a fun ride around town/will tackle shitty roads like a champ, but I would not market it as an off road or all terrain solution.

Pretty sweet but yes I agree with @teinol it appears to be much more of a hybrid strret board or enduro board rather than a strictly off road board. Damn good price though! Spectacular price and functionality especially for beginner enthusiasts for sure.

10s2p won't handle all terrain good enough. You should invest time in bigger enclosure and more cell capacity

When I asked about the batteries they said Sanyo 18650 10s4p with 48A output.

So it's a backfire ranger, possibly with a different esc curve, and a wowgo logo instead of backfire. Also a slightly higher top speed. (possibly done using a calculator and not factoring "loaded" speed with a normal rider, wind resistance, and battery sag)

Don't get me wrong, I like the ranger. But one would think something else would be different. At least it's a fair bit cheaper, I appreciate that.

Ninja edit, the enclosures are different.

*who knows it could still be bad D:

I dont know much about the sanyo cells but would it make sense that theyre using the NCR20700B cells then?

thats the only 12a cell from them I can find.... o.O 

if thats the case its probably going to dethrone the ranger

(no one should buy from this link, its just for clarification)

these? :thinking:

Only problem is thats a render, it looks more like this i think so no drop.
And slottet inserts for the hubs so prone to snapping if you jump over things with it.

Exactly, with that i wouldnt ride something like that on anything but perfect roads since that looks like it will snap or be a super weak spot.

Also they have no angle on the trucks so its not even a real dual kingpin wanna be evolve truck but idk.

It kinda is, its better then what half of the chinese companies in this case makes.

The ones on the Ranger X1 are basicly 10mm version of the Evolve trucks, they even fit together (The hanger works on it from Evolve)

interesting

I know someone found a seller for the brandless evolve double kingpin... i wonder if they just put in a bulk order :P 

looks cool none the less, solid trucks and I guess I would be on board..... the motors are a different story :laughing:

Not that again. Looks like they haven't learned from previous failures.

Frustrating. They could create a stunning mtb with more effort.

How did those hub motors perform?

if theyre totally identical to the rangers, then they have pretty decent performance. check out Daniel Kwans Esk8ing across China special on youtube, its great footage for the ranger.

Actually, it's Wowgo AT1, with different ESC, battery, truck and remote, different brand as well. 
The speed is higher because the truck is stable, you won't feel swinging when in high speed like other all terrain board.:wink:
