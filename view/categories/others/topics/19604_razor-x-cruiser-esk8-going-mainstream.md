All right up to 10mph !  Honestly at least that won't kill anyone and will get more peeps into esk8.  Pretty cool

These boards looks interesting! Since it is from an american company I believe it is going to be the first very low budget eskate woth buying! As said before, this would be perfect for taking with you on a plane (and ride in the airport!)! 

I might order a bunch of them and sell them to eskate newbies!

At this price point I care less abt speed ...I care abt time and distance... and if it's a quick charge time... 10mph max is slow...I may look at those ego 2 again ... that is at least docile and has a higher top speed ....

These look fine but it's the top speed that's kind of a deal breaker cause it's really slow...and people do learn very quickly on esk8

But...if they had easy replaceable battery packs....I think they'd have a true winner

the issue with replacebale pack is mainly size, arrangement and charging, also somewhat expensive

The problem with interchangable battery packs is that you have to carry the other ones with you. Kind of annoying
