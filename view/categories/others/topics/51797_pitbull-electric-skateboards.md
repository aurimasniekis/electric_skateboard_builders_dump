I got my first two boards fro Pitbull and have been more than happy. The first board was a dual motor carbon fiber deck 6s4p  and ive upgraded to dual hubs and a 10s5p. The owner Chris has amazing customer service and always takes the little time he has to answer your questions. I highly recommend them just on customer experience alone!!! Included a picture of my very first board an him taking the time to explain how everything works. He actually recommended this amazing website. Been hooked ever since

Berto, be honest. Dont slander my business. We became friends, or so i thought, then you became extremely mean when i reached out to you as a friend. We stopped talking because of disrespectful you were/are.

I still have the text messages. So dont try to discredit my business.

Read what I said. I didnt slander anything publicly. We had a dispute. If anyone wants my opinion i will gladly pm them and let them know my side of the story but you need to chill with calling names. Im not the one posting about not receiving a board and ive kept our incident out of public discussion so maybe just work on fixing your problem with fenchie
