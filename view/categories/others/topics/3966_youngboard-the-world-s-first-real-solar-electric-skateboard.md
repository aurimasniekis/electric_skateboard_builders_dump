25W panel? It will take hours to charge a decent pack. 

Also, it only has a 100Wh battery

Another scam on kickstarter claiming to revolutionize a product by using solar panels. At least it isn't solar roadways....

"This makes the solar panel reach 25 W power, and the capacity of battery is 100 Wh. Theoretically, 4 hours solar charging is equivalent to the time of conventional charging."

Some serious science went into this glad they did the math.
