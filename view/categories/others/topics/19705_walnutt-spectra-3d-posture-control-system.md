3D Posture Sensing Module
With a series of sensors, an integrated gyroscope and differential speed motor control that belongs in an electric car, anyone can learn to ride the SPECTRA in under 5 minutes, even you!

Driving System
Powered by 3.1‚Äù motors integrated into the wheels, SPECTRA has the ability to ride up to a 15 degree incline and then recharge on the way down.
 

Instant Brakes
SPECTRA is the only top tier electric skateboard that activates its braking system when it senses something is wrong. Saving you from embarrassment and physical harm.

They made them unmet the CEO a few months ago when riding and he let me tests it out then offered to let me be an alpha tester

üòÇüòÇthe thing is tiny and the the weight sensing isn't something you would commute with but they have a phone app u can control it with too

I have a Spectra Pro and something is wrong with it as it goes a max of 4mph! Being in UK they aren't able to help for months so I was wondering if anyone may be able to help me fix the problem?

Very few spectra out there so hard to tell. Could you be more specific with your issue ?

Basically the sensors just dont really speed up more than 3-4mph and when I use remote control even on pro mode it occasionally gets to 8/9mph. Im not a heavy guy so its not weight related...just feels like the power isn't getting to the motors and if it is, although I cant hear anything, the feeling is that something may not be catching and therefore not getting full force. Sorry for the strange explanation but Im not knowledgable at all in this field

If you can somewhat open the board check for loose connections etc. 
Then check for voltage of battery. 
Then it should be ESC related if nothing is wrong with connections

My guess would be that the battery can‚Äôt pull out enough amps for the 4 motors
