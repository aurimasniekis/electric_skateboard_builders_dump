Am going to say this I bet it's going to be straight cancer , annoying to ride and just gana want to kms ,like TEEMO (ignore all this it's a league of legends joke) you should have named it hec or singed board man those specs look nice, I don't see why you would name it something from hell that every person wants to kill lol

I am a rider based in Boston MA. if you would like someone to truly test your board and push it to its limits, send one to me. I will give a no BS opinion on the board. I have ridden the high end boards (boosted) along with boards similar to this one (meepo) and am currently testing the Landwheel L3-X. I know a good board when I ride it, and I can give you detailed and constructive feedback. Message me if you are interested. Thanks

I could help you test it I live in an old town that has tons of different roads to test it on there are newer roads, older roads, gravel roads, and just beat down roads it would truly test its ability.:slight_smile:
I have road a few boards to compare it to.
Kind of broke tho.
If you want you can reach me at esk8js@gmail.com

I could give you board a true flat out test as I have a start road with a bike lane and it is newer pavement I think only 1 and a half years old.  I also have some roads in my town that are in very bad shape so I could test the toughness of your board and post it to youtube.

I can provide a review of your board if youd like me to. Im familar with the components you are using and what to expect from them. If it doesnt have random remote cutouts,  doesnt shut down climbing small hills with an average sized rider due to voltage sag to the LVC and the urethane doesnt get loose or slip within the 1st few charge cycles I would be impressed and able to provide a positive review. U can even have the board back after, assuming you pay return shipping.

FYI. 

TEEMO will only provide you with a test unit if you have a high subscriber count (understandable). His offer of test boards is purely for advertisement purposes. So in my opinion, nothing to see here. Stick with @kieraneboard who has provided exception customer service with his budget board.

Not sure what you want anyone to review? This is a meepo board, or Diyeboard.com board, or a (insert dumb name here) board. You have done nothing new TEEMO. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out. 

Just go here and use any of these videos as your review. https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=meepo+board . It's not like you're unfamiliar with copycatting dude.

How about I will only test your piece of shit board if it was quality or promising in any way...sorry your crap doesn't meet my expectations..anyone willing to test this crap for a free board is a sell-out shill and will lose respect from the community..why would they want to do that to themselves?

edit, didn't mean to reply to mikenopolis..

Having someone review a board only because they have a high sub count is stupid. 

I can’t stand to see another YouTube blogger who knows nothing about esk8, get one of these, put clickbait title like “AMAZING NEW ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD, FASTER THAN BOOSTED!!” 
And then the review consists of: 
“package is nice hurrr durr”
“Looks nice hurrr durr”
And then 2 minutes of them riding it
“Goes forward, and worked for 2 minutes, incredible board, great company, buy it with my discount link HURR DURR”
```

There needs to be an affordable 20mile range board. They built a paved trail a few years ago and connected two a short walk from my house. It's 11 and a half miles to reach the train station to Chicago. Lord only knows why they've created train cars on the South Shore for bicyclists... SMH When we are the target audience...
Best honestly is a short board that can cover medium distances to ease on all the commuters.

Here is a link to a review I did on a board... the video has 3.9K views which is not real high but I have a few more review videos that have a few thousand views each also on the same board and some test videos that have a few thousand views on the boards also but I am looking to replace the brand as far as reviewing and standing behind the company and seen your boards a while back and been watching for the past month and love that you used the same hub motors used on another board that is selling at 3x or 300% more!!! SO I would love to see and test this board!!! I would do multiple review videos and test videos as well as mention it on other channels because I have networked with a few electric skateboarding YouTubers that wanted to have me on their channel because of a couple projects I have been working on that is for the electric skateboarding community!!! I would love to join the TEEMO team and do some solid review and test videos for the TEEMO BOARD!!!!!

I know you want that free board, but it’s probably not gonna happen since this Teemo thread is old and he stopped providing the few free units he was offering. You might consider sending him a PM. But I’m not sure you all cap essay will be easy for a Chinese person to read through. So keep it simple

I know it's another board from China but it seems that those guys had quite a lot of fun with it.

Hey Andy here with Speedsociety.com, I'm very familiar with E-boards and we have one of the largest network of followers on the net spreading across all social media platforms, (not just youtube) Around 60 million in total. Send us a board and we will review it. As you can see for yourself, most of our posts get between 300k to 1million plus views on facebook alone, not including all the views we could easily get from instagram, youtube or any of the other high ranking pages we own. 
Let me know if this is something you might be interested in,
Thanks
