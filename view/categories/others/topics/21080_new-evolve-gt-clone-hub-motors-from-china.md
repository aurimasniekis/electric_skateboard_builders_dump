I've been trying out the China e-boards for awhile. And over teh years, ive seen quite a few quality products like Landwheel and benchwheel coming along.

A quick google search on aliexpress lead me to discover an Evolve clone on the listings(with HUB MOTORS option too) This China company has been in the ebike business for some time and seems to be venturing into the eboard market in the recent. Thanks so much in advance. 

Other than flaming these clones, just wanted to know if anyone can verify the specs on this board?Thanks so much in advance.



Oh and here is the aliexpress link
