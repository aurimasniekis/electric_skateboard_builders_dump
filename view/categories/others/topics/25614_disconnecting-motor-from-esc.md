Which part of the cables do pull on to disconnect the motors from the ESC?
Can someone circle where i am supposed to disconnect it and show me?
Or do i just yank it from the socket, where you can see in the first pic?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/7/07e629cb031cd1ab2f531dff517687d9c6dc950c.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Do i pull it from the middle, bottom, top?

I thin you need to take the trucks off and take the component case off and diconnect them from inside. don't just yank on stuff.

```
you need to remove the trucks either way. 
I don't like the term "yank" I would prefer if you "gently unplug"
