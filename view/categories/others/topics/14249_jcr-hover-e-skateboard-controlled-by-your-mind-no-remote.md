this is funny, https://www.instagram.com/p/BNnv6RmAqeo/?taken-by=jcr_board, seems to accelerate on the motion of the board, you can see the dude thrusting his board to change direction.

Yes,There are sensors in the motherboard inside the board.just the familar technology as hoverboard.So it's much safer,much easier,and much fun than normal Eboard with remote.
I am the PM of JCR.
We will go on kickstarter soon. Follow me @jcr-board on instagram,and get more information.:grinning:
Any other questions,please let me know.

The problem with balance control motion is that if you got hit by something, you will naturally balance your self and that might put the eboard in a behaviour that the rider might not want. At some point it's just not really safe in my opinion.

It does not need the remote controller. You can control the forward and backward by intuitive control. The board will go when lean forward, to stop by lean backward. If you jump off or fall off from JCR skateboard by accident, the board will stop immediately.

Even if you ride skateboard at your first time, do not worry, you have never experienced the electric skateboard that can bring such a simple and pleasant feeling. This is the world's first truly intuitive control skateboard that incorporates gravity-sensing technology in a hoverboard. Furthermore, JCR board is safer, simpler, more practical, and more fun than a hoverboard and other e-skateboard. You can learn how to ride very well in less than 5 minutes. You can control the body's tilt angle to easily control the speed of the slide, the maximum speed is up to 20 km / h. In the event of an emergency, you are off the skateboard and the JCR board will stop to protect you.

JCR Board allows you to experience that you can control the board by your mind and the body, there is the feeling of flying. It is safer, more free and more fun than the skateboards with remote control.

Thanks for your good questions.
It's easy to solve. 
In our firmware,The speed don't change fast according to your balance,so it is really not a question.:grinning:
We have invited many ESK8 players to test JCR. All of them feel very good, fun,free,and easy.will update many videos on youtube later.

Welcome more questions.:slight_smile:

So i guess it measures the weight on the axles to identify if there is more weight on the front or the back. Hoverboard lean angle doesn't make sense to me when the board can't lean. So the only thing to identify what the rider wants is the weight difference on the axles. But maybe my imagination for other solutions isn't strong enough.

It is great to see that there are new ideas. But when i think about it then i think that you will concentrate more on your body balance. And i guess it could be very disturbing during carving. Next thing is the max speed. So i think it will find it's place for those who would buy a Hoverboard and are satisfied with it. 
But for DIY esk8 people the performance would be :sleeping:

If this accelerates by weight on front/back, then its super counter intuitive, as acceleration makes your body weight go back, but you want it to go front to accelerate. Same problem when trying to brake.
```

That looks pretty much like my theory. And i guess the acceleration and brake force is no problem when it does that very soft.

That's a pretty large claim. To be frank with you, I won't believe it until I see some serious tests, way more than a fancy video like that, maybe eve by some of the regulars on here.

On a side note, when did this forum become such a hotspot for the newest kickstarter esk8's to advertise? I was under the impression that most of us mostly built our boards...thus the "builders" part of the URL....

For your question: concentrate more on your body balance,you can think about how we walk? we concentrate on our walking when walk? You can see the feel on the video you just posted.(the boy play basketball),you will know it's same as walking.On the other hand,when you use remote controller,you must concentrate more on your speed control from remote.

it's total different tech. we use balance tech,same as quadcopters(DJI),handheld gimbals and hoverboards.
Zboard just transfer the control from your hand(remote)to your feet(pad),the control method is same.
Do you find any pads in our board?:wink:

I guess you measure the weight difference on the axles. Otherwise i would be really surprised. And by the way, i don't think about my control when i drive. It's like walking. 
But anyway, i like the idea of different control method's. Maybe it feels great. But i am pessimistic when it comes to carving. But hopefully you prove me wrong.

Yes,more serious tests are needed. 
we are doing other tests(range,speed,motor lifetime,ects) now. so we will do more compare tests with normal ones.
Certainly, remote controller must have its advantage too.Any techs have their two sides.

we know,this place is not a place to sell somethings.we just want to show this new tech,and get some advices.:slight_smile:

I know the feeling is also great by using remote controller.I rided it many times. So I know the feeling is really different.think about hand control vs body control...

How does it compensate when riding hills? Many change how their body weight is distributed when riding up and down hills.

I will also note, since I didn't notice it before, your top speed is 20 km/h (12.43mph). We generally aim for much faster boards so that will feel like a snail to anyone who has ridden any of our boards. My board goes about 50 km/h. That will also definitely change my weight distribution on the board (ie, I'm sure I'd be more cautious and aware of how my weight is distributed when I'm going faster)
```

If you think it as walking,it will be easy to understand.when we walk up hills,our body lean forward,when we walk down hills,our body lean backward.which is different with the ones with remote controllers: when you go down hills,you need brake frequently to control your speed.
We can take a shot to show the different later.

About the control methods when fast speed,we can think about the running.The caculation of angels of axis changing is fast by MCU,so the feeling you ride it just like running on the road.
For this,we also can post a video to show the feeling later.

As for the top speed(which is about motor and code),we will think about your advice to set a higher speed to fit for more needs.We can set different modes for different speed.

Thanks for your advices.:slight_smile:

It is intuitive and automatically stable. If it was the opposite you would fall off the board.
When you lean too much forward you step forward and when you lean too much backwards you step backwards.

Well, did you ride snowboard? Or seriously eboard? :stuck_out_tongue:

When i brake really hard with my eboard i **have**  to lean backwards otherwise i would fall forwards because the braking force is quite big. It is the same for the acceleration.
(By snowboarding you have always you pressure on the forefoot to control the curves!)

It is a intuitive motion and makes really sense!

I ride snowboard almost every night. You do not always put pressure on the forefoot.
As for body weight on a board, when you prepare for a strong brake you are actually putting pressure on your front foot, not the other way round.

Yeah, my thoughts exactly, and why I questioned that part. We'll see how this develops, but I'm not sure it will ever reach the level that we would need for very high powered boards.

I agree here. I have been considering this feature for a while. But after riding high speed boards now, I would never go 35 mph with a control like this. Your just asking you fall like that guy who road into the sand, and that was not pretty.

I'm interested to see where this goes.

@Sparki I don't know if you'll have anyone around the Bay Area with one, but if so, let me know and I'd love to give it a test. I am one of the more experienced members of this community terms of trying a lot of different technology and electronics.

@Michaelinvegas @Namasaki @rpn314 

Yes,according to our test,it's different when suddenly stop.

For JCR,you can't stop at once when the high speed.

For remote control,it's ok.(Certainlly,it is also very dangrous).

Is it a advantage or disadvantage? I dont know....

As for the two modes,a good idea!

Mix those two modes together.you can have remote in hand and body control same time. and remote function is priority.

Jason who owns endless sphere explains how he sets them up with stress sensors in the trucks. On his site I think he still sells the kit. It's pretty simple it seems. Amazing how accurate those sensors are measuring exact wattage through bicycle cranks. 
I'm surprised more people haven't done it.  Dying to try it.  Maybe it's awesome. He has some video of him accelerating and braking and at first I thought I wouldn't like it but the more I think about it I like it

Slick video and like the lights under.

The thing is, all of these examples vary pitch angle to control like a hoverboard. But on a skateboard your pitch angle is constant, you're relying on the other axis of the imu, which could be fun to compliment the remote, but it creates a very risky control method.

Another question, if only choose one,is the high speed important or climbing ability more important for users?

Thanks in advance.

A mix of both. You need torque and speed.

Considering the nature of this board, i would go for hill climbing. Speed would feel too scary without a remote

Agreed torque in lieu of speed is a better option with no remote.... it will have an easier time on rough pavement and sidewalks

[quote="laurnts, post:12, topic:14249, full:true"]
The problem with balance control motion is that if you got hit by something, you will naturally balance your self and that might put the eboard in a behaviour that the rider might not want. At some point it's just not really safe in my opinion.

i do agree if the item is a skateboard  with small wheels ,
but on a nine bot mini and alike its not  a problem due to the inflatable tyres 
the size of the wheel or wheels 
but on a skate board its really bad idea 
even the small wheeled 6.5 glide board was awful ,for this reason ,
plus if you have a wobble you are then in speed flux as well
it has buttons in the deck front and back and if you shift your balance 
and it thinks your foot is not on the button any more even for a second  
it apply's the brake instantly ,or you go into wobble major mode  very nasty 

the 10 inch one wheel glider is better as its self balancing like a ninebot mini 
 but its so hard to get on to it and set off 
i have had mine for about 2 months and i still can not get on to it a go yet ,
but it is better than the 6.5 inch version glider 
a self perpetuating see saw becoming dangerous 
from getting caught  on stones or any uneven ground as it is only 2 inches off the ground ,
so forget going up any even shallow inclines 
anyway i'm talking to much  
hand held controllers are the best 
,but not the ones that are pull back to go forward and forward to apply brakes 
thats just stupid .!

Those trucks look a bit fragile, I might be wrong but I'm heavy LOL. Did anyone get to ride the board yet? curious.
