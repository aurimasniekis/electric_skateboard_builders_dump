For Christmas/ New year 2018, I took a trip to Florida with my family and:
- Two Onewheels/ Onewheel+
- Two Boosted boards (G1/G2)
- Two Landwheel L3-x (Stock and custom)

Here's my review and compare video

The Chinese New year will be keeping Landwheel out of the office until Feb 27.  After that I can help you connect with the right people at Landwheel.  Find your original invoice.  Post again here after Feb 27 and we'll get you talking to the right people.

No pkasanda doesn‚Äôt. He is part of our group of testers who have been testing several iterations of the Landwheel drive and been providing Landwheel with realistic and sometimes very harsh feedback. They have taken the issues from the past very, very seriously and are constantly listening and improving their drive.

We are almost a year into this whole thing and the Landwheel drive has gone from borderline suicical to really one of the smoothest rides out there with great braking, great acceleration and a number of safety features. They really did listen to all the feedback and for the first time I would actually recommend the drive. The performance you get for this little money is unreal.

Cheers!

As @Technotron sais...  I do not work for Landwheel.  I'm a Landwheel customer who bought into the first batch that did not work so well.  Other early buyers like @Technotron, @Mikenopolis and about 6 others banded together into a volunteer team to guide the product improvement and road test each iteration.  As a community of Landwheel customers, we like to help others who purchased landwheels.

Oh I gotcha, makes sense. Yeah I recently got selected by Landwheel as one of the reviewers for L3-X, but the battery recently went out, and I sent them a video of the issue, just waiting for a response.

I would have to agree though, during the time I have been testing, it has been absolutely excellent.  Much better than the previous versions.

thanks to @pkasanda and @Mikenopolis   we've purchased two Landwheel L3X V5's 

Oddly enough, I discovered your original written review (about your family trip to Florida) searching for '_OneWheel Plus vs BoostedBoard_' 

I doubt very much I'd have ever discovered Landwheel if were not for your review (I've never considered riding a 'prosumer' board 25+ MPH downtown).

I believed you on the brakes so instead of 1 OneWheel, we went with (2) Landwheels and you guys were right: they're smooth at all speeds.

Mike's suggested fixes + his crazy little jetspud made me a fan.  Ours (today) are wearing a Mellow BuddyBuddy Cruiser and the other is bearing a prototype surf skate cruiser deck I designed in '99.  

Vibration is a concern _for_ the unit, not _from_ the unit (as with the Backfire 2).  I've mounted the Landwheel on pretty much every style of deck accessible and the 92MM? geometry can get a little weird with 1" riser blocks.

A little Loc-Tite here, a little Sorbothane there protects the Landwheel and delivers a better ride.  Definitely suggest replacing all soft parts out of the box; on the surf skate I have all white KranK (87a) and this is my new favorite setup.

I would prefer if the Landwheel battery had a USB port so I could call it a "charger" when flying (if you say it's a laptop battery it is OK).  A competitor of Landwheel will soon announce a new "twin battery" system that consists of two smaller and plane-friendly batteries - this is kind of awesome and I would suggest Landwheel consider that.

Anyway thank you, both. :slight_smile:

Hey Peron:

Congrats on the 2 landwheels.  

Your idea for the twin airplane sized batteries is a good one. 

Also love the idea of USB port to call the battery a power block.  It could also work to add the USB port to the charging dock. 

I'll make sure Landwheel takes note of your suggestions.

1 Inch riser blocks are pretty big.  You added those?  Pictures please.

Nice instructional Video from Andrew Penman.  He prefers a rigid board.  So that's contrary to my thoughts on chosing a flexy deck. But I supose thats the beauty of a Landwheel -- we get to pick the deck we like.

Andrew has some good mounting tips that appear to work well on a rigid maple deck that has no camber, but it does have a concave cross section.  

Specifically, Andrew's neoprene landing pad looks like it will prevent the L3-x from slapping the deck.

Skip to 9:09 if you want to jump to the Neoprene

Despite my usual complaints about CF boards causing numbness after about 6-7 miles, I tend to choose them over flex because of their stability at higher speed

Re Eon/Unlimited. Kickstarter appears not to have worked out for them between 2016 & 2017.   Now they are taking pre-orders on thier own web site.  The PU on the hub motors is unreasonably thin. All things to consider before you risk your cash on a pre-order.

Pre-order and start-ups are risky.

ATTENTION- I have the L3-X, and I have been a huge fan of it. However, I started having my doubts when I was told I would have to replace the screws on the unit since the wrong screws were used during assembly. EDIT: I replaced the screws on my landwheel and used a threadlocking compound. DON‚ÄôT DO THIS: it damaged the plastic housing causing it to break. If you already have, ask landwheel for a new enclosure and don‚Äôt ride your board until you replace it. for those who still need to replace the screws, just screw them in dry- don‚Äôt add anything else and it should hold up just fine.

@Penny_Pincher :
Thanks for the warning about how not to install the longer screws.  

In general, thread sealers like Loctite cure by interacting with metal.  So when you use these types of compounds on plastic, the liquid never cures. Instead, it sits there in liquid form disolving the plastic.

New landwheels now ship with the longer screws already installed. So the longer screw information is only applicable to customers who recieved theirs a month ago.

For purchaser of the early production run Landwheels, when you get your replacement screws, install them dry to protect the integrity of the ABS.

Also, just so you know what happens if you apply Locite (etc.) to ABS plastic, this article and picture provide details.

@ Mikenopolis thx!
(now I remember why he is familiar.) saw some of his PELTIER videos recently.

btw: I am happy to see Landwheel could eliminate the major problems and has a decent setup now.
(I told them 2 years ago to actually listen to the community, not just say "say it")
seems they learned their lesson, even it was the hard way.

Wait til the 27th.  And I'm sure you won't need to ship anything back if it is a replacement that you are seeking.  IT would be replaced with and L3-x.  No one should be fixing V2/V3/V4 Landwheels.

Hey everyone!  With the advice from @Mikenopolis I‚Äôve got my hands on the L3-X drive.  I saw from early stages that Landwheel was working with the DIY audience to get some hones feedback.  Unlike many of the esk8 companies, popular and generic, Landwheel basically fed themselves to the wolves!  This was really admirable to me and I‚Äôve noticed some big strides to get to this V5 iteration.  I‚Äôm finally working on a quick unboxing video but will eventually be doing a more comprehensive review videos well. If ya‚Äôll would invite it, I can post the vids here when their complete.

@nmagz3 Even though the drive is good in terms of performance (swappable battery somewhat nullified the range complaints), I hope you read up on the falling apart issues and the potential fixes we discussed. Until Landwheel addresses these breakages and offers a retrofitted reinforcement, the durability of the plastic battery enclosure is doomed to fail over time.

Please get yourself a long Velcro cinch strap and secure it around the unit so the battery and metal plate has no room to move. This makes battery swap slightly more tedious but it will prevent catastrophic failure.

Yeah I have read that in your guys‚Äô discussions which will help me review this honestly, thanks!  Before my review, I should make sure with Jason that I have their longer hardware.  In addition to that I appreciate your tip on the Velcro strap.  For the review I was hoping to keep any modifications incognito.  Do you think a Heavyduty Velcro strip would fit between the drive and the deck would work?

Mike's comments are fair and timely.  Over the last week, within the volunteer group of beta testers, we have observed in our private forum a new failure of the screw posts that hold the plastic shell to the metal base plate.  In this new case the longer screws had already been swapped.  The unit was about 3 months old.  

A number of the beta testers have some manufacturing and injection molding back ground.  We've  studied the characteristics of the plastic shell in detail and have identified specific changes that we feel should be made to the mold for the ABS shell.  We have also recommended the addition of a number of metal components to bind the ABS shell to the Aluminum base plate.

We agree the recommendations are fundamentally sound and flexible enough that Landwheel should be able to translate these recommendations into their own improvements to the mold and fastening system.  Experience tells us that Landwheel takes our safety and durability recommendations very seriously so we anticipate a positive and swift response.

I suspect the recommendations will be accepted and customers will receive replacement parts to correct the identified vulnerabilities.

We need to wait until the end of the Chinese New Year to get a response to these proposals as this period of holidays is very strictly observed.  I expect we'll hear back from Landwheel very close to the 27th of February.

In the Interim, the beta testers all agree that two Velcro straps (with buckles) attached tightly  to the battery after it is inserted is the best way to prevent the plastic fatigue on the screw posts and safe guard against the type of failure that would cause the battery compartment to pull free of the aluminum base plate.

These are an example of the type of strap that we feel would be best.  Notice the buckle.
https://www.homedepot.com/p/VELCRO-Brand-3-ft-x-2-in-Velstrap-Straps-2-Pack-90440ACS/202261929

Like Mike says.  Nylon strap.  Not Elastic.

We recommend that everyone ride with this simple low cost addition until such time as a set of replacement parts is available from Landwheel.

Yes.  Slide the straps between the deck and the drive.  Position the buckle to one side and close to the deck.  Thread the velcro to get as much surface contact as possible, then trim to length.

I'm curious to know if this happens only to me?
I have also extremely voltage sag, I mean I can run like 2 kilometers good but then if I press full throttle the BMS jumps and cut the power, the only solution I find it at the moment is on/off every time to make it work and give gas gentle until at least reach home.
I hope you guys can comment on this.
P.s I did run like 8 batteries fully charged, as a reference for the wheels and the battery sag
Thanks!

Yes, the blue sticker of certification is there, I got it from landwheel to test it and reviewed.
The range I can do is around 2km full specs and after that just cuttings all the time. 85kg + gear 90+-2
Now I'm riding in cold temperatures, but I'm starting with warm the batteries from home.
Anyway after the 2 initial km It goes warmer from under the batteries and the batteries where is the esc, but I believe that's normal.
How about the urethane of the wheels? Riding in Amsterdam is amazing because everywhere is bike path, really smooth.

I got 2 km range in canada at -6 degrees celcius.  I too started with warm batteries. I weigh 225 lbs.  Your riding weight is 200 lbs.  So our cold weather range is similar.


With the same batteries I got 5 miles (8 km) in Florida on a really rough sidewalk route with stop and go every intersection. Temperature was cool for Florida, not more than 22 degrees celcius.

Andrew Penman got 7 miles (13 km) on a single battery in Australia on a continuous route and even warmer temperatures (perhaps 27 degrees I'd guess).

I'd put 99% odds that your 2km range is entirely due to temperature.

When I first saw your picture of the Urethane wheels I was puzzled becasue I thought mine had no such cracking.  I was ready to blame your cold weather in Amsterdam.  

But I took a closer look at my wheels and If I tugged on the edges, I could see the cracks forming.  The good news is that I have a fix that will correct the existing cracks and should prevent this type of damage in the future.

The same fix is something Landwheel should be able to implement on the production line so that the products don't need to be modified after shipping.  See my next post for details

This is a permanent fix for cracking urethane at the edges of the motor wheels and a temporary fix for the problem of screw posts and battery latches breaking.

Thanks to other landwheel owners who have been looking at these issues with me in our private forum.  Contributors include @Mikenopolis @Technotron  @DevoCut  @rhinoinflight @jaysleezzyy  and others.

Also thanks to     @Surfer  and @ShutterShock  for escalating the Urethane cracks on the edges in the Landwheel review group.  I did not actually notice any cracks on my wheels until I went looking for them.

The following video shows how to fix any cracks that have formed and prevent them from propagating. The same fix will likely prevent all future cracking at the edges.

There is also a fool proof temporary fix to prevent any form of shell failure at the screws or battery latch.

I also discuss the root cause of the screw failure to point out that minor changes to the mold can correct the current deficiencies.  I supect the fix will be drilling out the mold to create large well supported posts and to implement either metal inserts or some other form of metal re-inforcement to transfer load.

I expect landwheel will be responding to correspondence from the beta testers shortly after the 2 week Chinese national holidays end on the 26th.

It is very important to note that the urethane fix involves some sanding that creates a lot of dust.  Any kind of dust can be very bad for your lungs immediately and can be lethal much later in life.  Please wear an air tight dust mask with proper filters and preferably perform the sanding outside.

Please watch the video for details.

I really appreciate the depth of which you guys have tested this.  Unlike many of the new esk8 companies out there, I respect Landhweel for diving head first into the opinions of the DIY scene.  This is opposite of what I've seen Evolve do.  This makes this a very interesting product for me to review.  I've actually received many offers to do reviews on Chinese companies & new kickstarters.  However, I've recently decided to hold back on reviewing those type of vendors as the quality control of products, with the boom of esk8s in the scene, has been lack thereof.  I'm happy that I can review this product with the preface that Landwheel takes the customers opinions seriously.

Just to clarify.  I do not work for  Landwheel.  But it is true that myself and the other customers who interact closely with landwheel as a volunteer beta test team have been taken very seriously and every one of our recommendations over the past two years has been addressed and resolved.  So yes.  They are very customer driven.  Myself and the other testers are very confident that these remaining issues will be fixed on the production line and that corrective parts will be sent to the existing customers.  Landwheel has been very consistent about doing this in the past.

For sure, I know you're not employed by them.  Just an enthusiast with the desire for a good product!  That to me is admirable from both the perspective of the company and tester.  The only electric drive vendors I'm familiar with are Landhweel, Mellow, and Onan.  I haven't found much history on Landhweel.  May I ask how long you all have been testing with them?  It's good to know the face behind the company and Jason has been very responsive.  I've also noticed in recent weeks another company that has a clone/white label of Landwheel's L3-X.  I believe they go by Revel Boards.

There‚Äôs also the brand I hate which is Psykoboard. I kept telling everyone on their social media post that they are just rebranding Landwheels (the failing versions). they constantly state that they designed and engineered the things and that it's 100% Italian made which is why it's better...also their deck looks stupid and thick for no apparent reason.

HAHAHA, I always thought the psykoboard look stupid too! 
 Well, the reason I ask is that I want to give credit where credit is due.  I have nothing against Chinese companies.  If anything, vendors there are at an advantage because most of the manufacturing in the world is done in China!  However, I am against crap companies that have very little quality control.  It looks like Landwheel has been taking a beating for the end result to be a good product.  It's annoying that a company like Revel Boards would just take the credit and pretend they've been doing all the work. :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

Revel Boards
[/quote]

As for Revel Boards, I suspect this company may have recently brought in a large shipment into the US via shipping container to streamline the transportation cost.  Rebranding may have been part of the deal.

So customers would get an L3-x. Price, branding and local stock would be the differentiatior.  That's what I suspect. I found the link.  I'm not promoting it.  This is just what I found when I searched for revel boards.

https://www.revelboards.com/electric-skateboard-kit.html

Edit:  I took a second look at their web site.  They did put together a decent north-american grade web site that makes it easy to order accessories, pay by credit card etc.  They do have a california address and phone number.  So they may have been wise to re-brand so that they do not end up supporting customers who purchase landwheels else where.

They do keep local stock and ship in 2 business days.  So given the choice of purchasing from an amazon store front and this re-branding, the Revel may have some advantages.  I suppose it depends on thier customer support.

[quote="nmagz3, post:66, topic:45697"]
May I ask how long you all have been testing with them?
[/quote]

Many of the original beta testers ordered their V1 and V2 units from Landwheel prior to July 2016.  Individually we communicated through the Landwheel sales representatives the things that we observed were not working. Progress was initially hard to see.

We beta testers came together as a group about a year later in July 2017.  Up until then, Landwheel had sent out many replacements but the improvements were not resulting in a safe or reliable product.  Consequently the company's image was getting beat-up pretty badly in the forums --- despite what seemed to be a genuine intention to satisfy customers.

The original six beta testers agreed that we wanted Landwheel to succeed both because we wanted working products for ourselves and because the people that we had interacted with at Landwheel seemed so dedicated towards satisfaction.  

We estimated that the Landwheel drives worked well on the factory floor with light Chinese riders at relatively slow speeds.  On real roads at higher speeds with heavier riders, the drives did not function well. 

We felt that a team of testers was needed to test on long challenging rides, and to provide feedback.  We agreed this might be the only way the many product flaws were going to get resolved.  

We also wanted to communicate with the top level of the Landwheel company because we suspected that culturally, Chinese workers were likely not going to be comfortable presenting the very harsh criticism of customers to their bosses.  Also, we wanted to craft the communication with Landwheel to be very respectful and to remove the harsh negativity that typically erupts on public forums when customers don't get what they expected.

We reached the owner of the company and proposed to be a small volunteer test group and suggested that new versions be sent only to our group until we as a team agreed that the products were safe and durable.  We also proposed to reduce the number of replacements to help control costs.  So when a new version was ready, it was sent out to a subset of the test team, not everyone.  We also proposed that new units not be sold until the Beta test team felt the product was safe.

Finally, we moved our conversation from the public forums to the private forums so that the discussion of the product flaws and risks could help Landwheel -- without simultaneously bringing about the public disassembly of their brand and reputation.

The original six members were very experienced electric longboarders and DIY builders.  Several had expert level experience with Lithium batteries, and BMS design. We each brought some level of testing and diagnostics experience.  Most of us were from the software industry and understood the value of scientific methods, experimentation and documenting results.

Some of the major items that Landwheel redesigned based on our feedback included increasing battery capacity, redesigning the ESC to throttle back acceleration to keep the battery above critical voltage and the incorporation of electric locomotive grade braking algorithms into the ESC logic.  

Landwheel also redesigned the battery BMS, upgraded the urethane and increased the diameter of the wheels based on recommendations from the beta test team. This is just a short list.

The beta test team was comprised of riders of a variety of different weights.  This was a critical success factor as it exposed how brakes could function safely for a rider of one weight and completely unsafely for riders of a different weight.  

In this area, I believe Landwheel gained a huge advantage over their Chinese counter parts and even over some of the prestige brands.  

Today, when I see video reviews of other Chinese boards, I hear comments from some reviewers saying the brakes on board ABC are "great" while other reviewers are flying off the front of the same board. 

Even some of the top priced North American brands are having difficulty with downhill braking that can throw a rider on to the pavement or leave them without brakes.  When I hear a reviewer say "whoah those brakes are powerful"  it‚Äôs a sign to me that people are going to get hurt.

The braking outcomes in the L3-x are spectacular and Landwheel might actually lead on many dimensions of braking logic.   Brakes are so important in my mind (as you may have gathered from my recent post on a Pomela YouTube review).  

So few people who are reviewing electric skateboards understand that brakes that perform marginally poor for one rider can have catastrophic results for another riders of a different weight.  

Similarly brakes that work well on a flat surface can perform in very unexpected ways on a downhill grade.

There is a huge difference between one youtuber test riding a board and giving it a thumbs up compared with a team of riders testing the same board.

Landwheel made many of their own improvements over and above the recommendations of the beta testers. 

Between July 2017 and today, Landwheel sent the beta testers over 50 units to test.

The L3-x was the first version that we beta testers gave the thumbs up to.  Our reactions were universally positive to the first low volume run of L3-x.  Most beta testers owned multiple boards and the L3-x became the favorite ride for most of us.

Three months later the beta testers continue to stress test the L3-x.  This testing has produced some failures of the L3-x shell.  We have directed a great deal of study discussion and experimentation to this flaw and feel we have put together a menu of viable re-engineering ideas to Landwheel.  It will be up to Landwheel to translate these into changes to the product and production line (as they have done many times in the past).

To date, the Beta testers have exchanged 1200 posts with each other.  The initial 6 members have now grown to 14.  The new members have been invited based on posts that show up in the public forums. 

When a customer posts about a problem that seems new, the beta testers draw them in to the private forum to gather more details, pictures and testing input.  In this way, the testing and analysis reaches beyond the numbers and miles logged within the beta testers.

So, that's the history of the beta testers.  The journey for the testers and for Landwheel has been long and interesting with some pretty amazing results.  The beta testers have done most of their work out of the public eye, for reasons that I described above.

However, you are correct.  Companies that have a solid beta test program end up producing much better, safer and reliable products than those who do not.  So the quiet background  efforts of the beta testers are indeed a very valuable ingredient to consider before recommending a product.

Also, as you say, a company that embraces its customer's feedback in this way is worthy of recognition and trust for having done so.

Sorry for the late reply, as I wanted to really give your piece a good read.  This was an incredible documentation of you're experience with Landwheel.  It seems to be a long time coming for you and the others that have either just beta tested or needed a working product.  But, the outcome seems to be positive.  The combination of experienced riders and builders really gave the product a transformation that I don't see many Chinese companies doing.  

It's interesting to see how common it is to hear a reviewer say "those brakes are strong" in a positive way.  Unlike some of the DIYers, the common person may not know that a comment like that may lead to a possible hard braking issue that Chinese boards have.  My first build was built with the VESC and the buttery smooth and configurable braking was something I was used to.  So after reviewing a couple boards with hard breaking, I knew that it was my responsibility to report truthfully or people can really get hurt.  But, you're right that many production board companies are not getting the braking on their boards right.

I really appreciate you sharing your experience and letting me pick your brain.  I've noticed Landwheel sending out LX-3's to esk8 YouTubers such as Andrew Penman, Tishwan, Ronnie Sarmiento, myself and others.  As part of the DIY community I see things from a different perspective than some of my counterparts.  I've had my experiences with other Chinese and Kickstarter type companies and really ran into the same things...an unrefined product.  It refreshing to hear your story and to hear that there are companies and esk8ers that have worked together in hope to bring a great product into the market.

So, right now I'm sitting on my LX-3 trying to figure out my approach to review and report on the interesting machinery that it is.  The back story to it is great and It would be unfair to categorize it as your typical Chinese company.  However, it does still sound like it is a work in progress.  Thanks again for your help. 

I hope it'd would be okay with you if I used your write up as a reference to my in depth review.  I plan to do an unboxing, talking about general specs. Then I'll follow up with an in depth review of my experience along with the experience of others.  Your write up will help me approach this review with a journalistic perspective.  As a reference it will help me paint a picture of how the product came to where it is now.

Thanks again!

I would suggest that you delay your review video until Jason reads up on the issue we currently have. I'm pretty sure stating that this drive is "a work in progress" would drive away potential customers and not saying it would be false advertising and dangerous. 

Once Landwheel gets back to us on their next step you can at least honestly let viewers know of what to expect and in the meantime they can add a strap onto the unit and feel confident that the company will standby their warranty.

Just wanted to point out to anyone in a winter region where the roads are salted that you should wait until the early April showers wash the salt dust off the roads. 

 Salt is deadly for most any skateboard.  The salt will permeate the bearings.  Corrosion will follow shortly thereafter.

For any e-board, salt will also permeate battery contacts & BMS (if there is a removable battery) and electronics unless these areas are completely dust and moisture proof.

Outrunner motors (like a boosted board) would be seriously damaged by salt dust.  Hub motors would be affected primarily at the inner bearings.

The only exception would be a OneWheel if you are diligent about giving it a shower every time you get home.

Other than that, no matter what electric skateboard you ride, salt dust will destroy your skateboard. 



Just because the snow has melted does not mean its riding season yet -- not unless you consider your e-board disposable.


And if the roads are only sanded, then its still worth waiting for the street sweepers to brush the slippery sand of the roads before you start carving.

Quick Update:

Landwheel is now working on a set of metal brackets that anchor the  ABS shell to the aluminum backing plate.  One clamp makes use of the two truck bolts that are closest to the power switch.  The second clamp is a strike plate that reinforces the battery latch and clamps under the Aluminum base plate.

I believe this will work.

If I understand correclty, you want to know how to remove/replace the hub motors on the V4.  As I recall, the V4 shipped without the special tool required to tighten or remove the axle nut.  The L3 X ships with this tool.  Its just a thin walled socket. It looks like this.

![image|543x292](upload://boKoyDhJiSaOF4N50rMTkReuQmd.jpg)

If you have a spare 13mm deep socket and a belt sander, I imagine you could mount the socket on a drill and turn down the outside.  Not sure if that would work but its possible.  Otherwise, you might be able to order the tool from Landwheel.

Does that answer your question or were you just wanting to know how to remove/Replace the PU Wheel covers?

Removing the PU wheel covers is much easier.  Remove the hub cap.  Then you will see 4 screws that need to be removed.  Finally, you need to look for the matching four screws on the back side of the wheel.  There are 8 screws in total.  

When you re-install the new PU wheel covers, use proper technique to tighten these up. Use the same technique as for tightening lug nuts on a car.  Tighten each screw a little bit at a time and cycle across and around.  For example do a light tightenting of opposing screws  1,3,2,4.  Then repeat the opposing screw cycle four or five times.  Then finish up with a few cycles of  around the clock -- 1,2,3,4.

The wrong way to re-install the wheel would be to fully torque one bolt before moving to the next.  If you did that, you would likely end up with a significant wobble or you could end up cross threading some of the screws

wow!!! ... yes i needed that because someone else answered my question... but didnt include that info... but i did notice that the axle nut is somehow recessed into the wheel so that makes sense now...  i would have been shit outaa luck trying to unscrew it with needle nose plyers or something





the main info i was looking for was how the hub wheel locks onto the truck... i later found out it was with a square section of the hanger that locks into the stator...  same as maytech hub motors... for some reason no one ever talks about this as though its not important,... which it is.. because hub motors require special trucks... and sellers never make it clear and it just becomes a nightmare down the road when you need a different truck or something.. or if you want to create a private label brand using certain hub wheels and find out you cant use just any truck... etc.....

wasnt really interested in removing the PU wheels... nor will i ever be... because i refuse to treat that as anything less than actual common sense information lol... and am pretty peeved that everyvideo ive ever seen on "how to remove the hub wheel" just covers removing the PU wheel and nothing else.. and im left pausing the video for the half a second the camera is pointed at the backside of the wheel butted up against the truck trying to decipher how it is mounted. 

doesnt help that most chinese manufacterers are dumb and often times on an alibaba listing... one picture shows the underside of the board with one type of hub motor... and another shot you can clearly see a completely different type of hub motor with a different truck... and cant even be sure what youre getting on a massive order of 100 boards or something to be private labeled... kinda messed up if you ask me 

i am trying to actually use my own custom trucks with this same hub motor... with a very tight hanger width... 

im curious how long the axle is (not including the square part of the hanger)  in order to fit the unusually widehub motor width cmpared to regular longboard wheels with the recessed bearings...... it seems liek it could just be the regular axle width such as on regular skate trucks...

So you want to produce your own brand of electric longboard with wider stance trucks and you want to base it on the Landwheel Motor only?  Or you want to private label a Landwheel but substuting wider trucks?  I can see the advantage of wider trucks, not just for stability at speed but also to extend beyond the width of the board to avoid wheel bite (Board hitting the wheels when you turn).

i actually want to offer a variety of truck widths... some up to 230mm total width... (the boards are extremely long and therefore never really get tripped over when kicking off analog style...) which yes... does reduce wheel bite.. stability... but also is part of a whole different subculture of skaters that is totally unaware of electric skateboards.. its basically the chill layed back 6 foot longboards that are very flexible and low to the ground and meant to ride slow... it has a huge following in my area

also i actually want to offer SUPER NARROW trucks... that in no way shape or form stick out from underneath the deck... and want to prototype the SMALLESAT EBOARD EVER MADE... google search the SPECTRA e board... and tell me that thing doesnt look super goofy AF with the wide trucks... 

when i used to own an acton blink the first thing i did was transfer everything over to a smaller deck for portability... and the main issue was not the battery fitting on a smaller deck thats a cake walk and without even sacrificing the kicktail... the main issue was the stupidly wide trucks... and the hub motor version AND the belt drive version both only worked on the proprietary trucks... and even if i did a diy belt version... that means even less space for squeezing the battery between the truck and needing a  longer board... and it means that the trucks can only be so narrow before you cant fit the before you have problems fitting the thick brackets and belt gears... hub motors could basically be a hair away from touching the kickpin and wouldnt really have any problems... 

the only options are spend thousands of dollars to argue with chinese people about building a mold... or take an angle grinder and cut a square piece out of the truck hanger and call it a day... but you can only use certain hub motors with the square hole... ill chose the latter..... also removing material to make the hub motor slide over the hanger... or even removing entire parts of the hanger to expose more axle... means that most hub motors will go past and expose some threads to get a few turns on the axle nut... while without that the hub motor would be too wide...

Do you have pictures? I think the long dance boards are kind of cool in general but I don't see the advantage of putting narrow trucks on them.  Regarding the micro boards, I can't imagine putting a 48KPH set of hub motors on a micro deck.  Your interests seem to be at two polar opposites of the spectrum of e-boards. Not criticising you for it.  Its just an observation.

basically:

the extra wide trucks go on the long boards... 

the mini trucks go on the mini boards...

i wouldnt put the mini trucks on the long boards because the whole point of the mini trucks is to fit the board in a backpack (standard size trucks make it difficult... no matter how tiny the deck)


when i first met the guy who makes these decks...  i was riding a "alva" 60's style wood penny board style thing... i was obsessed with carving and turning around tight corners and stuff is what i was after... we were smoking a joint at a bon fire when i met the guy he walks up introduced himself and proceeded to comment on my "nice" Alva board but added that he himself prefers the much longer boards...  

i was imagining he was talking about more like boosted board length (didnt exist at that time) so i thought to myself... what an idiot... to each his own... if he like giant boards that arent portable thats his problem... and also what a snob... i guess hes one of those speed freaks that wants the 0.2% more speed that longboards give... but also cant turn around a sidewalk corner to save your life... and tick tacking around the corner is even more difficult... and the long boards just overall suck at carving down the street in a tight S curve.... 

then when i talked to him months later he explained to me that he is not some downhill speed snob at all...  it would actually be DANGEROUS to do that on his boards... these boards are basically 2 boosted board lengths... nothing like what i was imagining... and actually meant to be ridden slowly... theyre designed for safety for like 40 year olds that just wanna barefoot ride these giant bouncy flexible boards to the beach or boardwalk and cant really afford a fall... theyre super low to the ground and good for your hips when pedaling... and the trucks are super wide but tripping over them is never a problem because the board is so long... and furthermore... turning around the corner on sidewalks worst case scenario you just stop the board and spin it with your hands... and jump back on... i rode it for the first time and was sitting there like "oh i understand now"... its not like some ergonomic old person medical board either... it just ends up coincidentally being a lot easier and safer to ride... 

if anything..... the boosted sized board crowd are even bigger idiots than him because they WONT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE how shitty they are at carving or turning corners or tic tacking... they just act like theyre totally fine and theres no pros and cons to moving to a short board... and just say shortboards suck because the longboards go like 1% faster and i guess theyre trying to set the downhilling world speed record or something...  

this guy at least acknowledged... yeah they suck at turning... its meant for straight lines and chill, safe, bouncy flexible riding or like hanging ten on an exaggeratedly long board...  and its a conscious decision that you dont mind spinning the board with your hands sometimes... in order to get those other benefits...

he actually makes them in his basement with a CNC machine and stuff uses sand as the grip tape in the stain on the wood... and has a huge following... people pay him like $500 for them... its kinda dumb expensive but its all his neighbors and stuff so i get why they do it... for like a custom board... etc... 

as far as having polar opposite interests... im actually only interested in personally riding one of these style boards... but interested in prototyping and possibly selling both... try to guess which one... (the mini)... 

the larger board was a nightmare to convert because no hub motor factories sell 230mm wide trucks... not a single one

same issue for the mini trucks for smaller style board... 

the only option these days is to use both style boards with the same size truck (speaks volumes about the damage casey neistat has done to the hobby)... WHEN I CONVERTED BOTH BOARDS TO ELECTRIC... i got complaints from the longboard crowd that they miss the giant trucks and asking why the front trucks are so much bigger than the rear drive trucks... nobody complained about the mini board having wide trucks... (but i still noticed the cumbersomeness)


also n$%#@ please... I could ride 20mph on one foot drunk on a board the size of 1 and half feet WITH NO GRIP TAPE... its not an issue for me...  so i refuse to discuss stability, speed wobbles, etc... its all nonsense... speed wobbles OK MAYBE... its also just minor issues that can be worked out later on... the main thing is the overall concept.. dont worry about the details...

thats liek saying a prebuilt electric skateboard is bad because the plastic enclosure is brittle or the trucks crack in half... uuhh.. doesnt say anything about the motor/ battery/ esc... and would be even less important if companies and factories would just STANDARDIZE HUB MOTOR TRUCKS... then you could easily go and buy fancy (SNOBBY) titanium hub motor trucks or some shit that will fit your hub motor wheels... people on this forum saying the such and such koowheel or landwheel production board trucks cracked on them... uuh then use the trucks you like... or build some that are made of serious metal... and keep the motor/esc/battery from the product.... same thing happens on cheap longboards....  the hanger will crack in half sometimes... oh thats funny for a second i forgot we werent on the ANALOG LONGBOARD STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY FORUM.... a production e-board product shouldnt be judged on the hanger being type 5 aluminum (lol thats nonsense im not a metallurgist)... it should be judged on the battery specs being shitty and the esc having cheap wiring... and whatever.... 

and complaining about speed wobbles on the SMALLEST EBOARD EVER MADE is akin to complaining about lower grade aluminum perfectly machined trucks on a raptor 2...  (he actually uses some fancy heat sink metal so bad example)


 people need to stop assuming for me what i can and cant ride... like oh thankyou! for deciding for me that i wont be able to ride fast on a mini board so putting a speed limit on it (*cough* Kuickwheel Serpent C)

sure... i dont imagine youre judging me... but i hope you understand what it is im after... lots of people dont see the point of different sized trucks... and have been telling me to just buy a raptor 2 or a meepo and im like... did you just listen to anything ive said... or telling me to buy meepo boards or something and to use the parts for a diy project.. when the meepo hub motors are specifically impossible to make custom trucks for...  or to just buy an Acton blink S because its "portable enough"... when it uses huge trucks... and proprietary hub motor brackets... that would be very hard to create custom mini trucks for...  actually meepo and acton hub motors are the same bracket system... 

also i enjoy one more than the other... but if i were to use both... it would be under totally different circumstances and applications... its really just recognizing what people in my neighborhood are after.... and trying to build it for them... 2 major crowds... because its really not available on the market so far...


oh and yes i will be posting the results!

The alibaba price is for a minimum of 5 units.  Also, those Alibaba adds are from manufacturer's reps.  Hold off for 48 hours and I'll see if I can set something up for you.  The beta testers are about to order a bunch of L3-x and parts for themselves.  I'll look into inviting you in to the ordering process.  I always like to point out that niether I nor any of the beta testers profit from Landwheel sales. We just have good contacts at the manufacturer and want to see them succeed.

So just took a 4WD ride.  230 pound rider including helmet & Gear. Zero degrees. 5.59 kilometers consumed 1/4 battery.

Note the up hill acceleration.  I was no where near top speed for any of this.  The roads have too many pot holes and my knees are still recovering from a christmas time immune system attack on my joints know as PMR.

Anyway, you can see me hit 35 KPH on a flat.  Then later, accellerate up hill from 23 kph to about 32 KPH before slowing down for  an intersection.  Brakes are spectacular  check out the full tilt stop at time index 8:20 and again at 12:00.

Send  me a PM with your original invoice and I'll try to help you get back on the road.  I don't work for Landwheel as you  may gather from prior posts.  I do collaborate with the volunteer beta testers and we do get special prices for replacement parts. You'd be ordering from Landwheel, not from me or the beta testers.  We'd pass on your details.

The majority of my batteries have lasted for over 2 years.   Only 1 out of  six of my batteries failed and it was a used prototype battery that came to me with 200 km already on it.  Based on my experience with that battery, I can tell you that a landwheel battery that drops to 36 volts is very difficult to resurect. Even if you do resurect it, the capacity would be mininmal and it will fail again.

Opinions on battery maintenance vary.  Personally, I never leave my batteries in the Landwheel dirves overnight. When I store the batteries for months, I leave them in the charger (green light).

Others say not to do that for fear of fire.  

However, have a number of V2 batteries that I've been storing for several years in the charging bases. 

EDITS:
I check them periodically and they all stay NEAR peak voltage. Periodically, I remove and re-insert them and they'll take a fresh charge. THEN THEY CHARGE UP TO PEAK VOLTAGE

I left my V4 and L3-x batteries for 3 months in the chargers over winter, all with good results.

I've done the same with my boosted boards and One Wheels.

Leaving any lithium battery out of the charger for more than a month or two risks letting the voltage drop to a level that will permanently damage at least one cell in the battery.

Are those V4 batteries or L3-x batteries.  What drive do you have, V4?  V4 upgraded to L3-x?  or L3-x?

Well, i think it is fact that a battery degrade even quicker when hold at Peak voltage.... I only Charge my batteries to 4.1 and store them at 3.8-3.7. Thats common practice

The main issue with the last orange wheel version (the one we call V4) was the harsh braking

The latest black wheel ones (L3-X) are great as far as the ride and operation. The issue we have is the weight of the battery and vibration over time pulling the plastics casing away from the metal base so everything essentially falls off. This is due to the new battery being heavier and the abs just not being strong enough for the abuse a Esk8 puts on it. Landwheel is working on a retrofit fix to this. But a simple Velcro cinch strap will work. You just need to strap the battery and housing to the base of the drive unit so the weight it distributed to the strongest material.

did the V4 have the same issues with the battery being heavy or comming apart in any way? 

what about the V3?

were there any issues with electronics failing due to poor onnectors or something? on V3, V4, or LX-3?

did the V4 or V3 need the replacement screws or otherwise have anything wrong with the screws or locktite used by the factory...

[/quote]

Yes.  The V4 had limited range becasue the ESC lacked the pacing needed to keep the battery above critical voltage during accelleration.  The V4 would accelerate full tilt without concern for battery voltage.  Voltage would drop during accelleration and then the V4 woud suddenly shut down.  The L3-x paces the accelleration so as to maintain a buffer between battery voltage and critical voltage.  L3-X range depends a lot upon temperature and continuity of the run.  Temperatures near zero reduce range.  Long continuous runs increase range because the relatively frictionless hub motors can coast very efficiently.  Andrew Penman in Australia did a "warm" continuous run of  11.1 kilometers on 3 out of 4 battery lights.

https://youtu.be/NQFI0hfoRGs?t=471

Stop and go rides with heavier riders in colder temperatures seems to produce a ride of about 6.75 kilometers for a full battery down to zero.

Naturally, a second battery to swap or a 4WD set-up extends the range.  I get about 6 KM of range on 1/4 battery at zero degrees on my 4WD.  However, I doubt I'd get an additional 6 km for the remaining three lights.  Cold weather and low battery don't work well together.  In warm weather, I'm pretty sure I could get 20 - 24 kilometers out of the 4WD Landwheel.  No way for me to test that theory out for a few months.

ESC failures were common on the V3 and V4. 

The L3-X ESC is completely different and has been very reliable unless used in conjunction with a V4 battery.  The L3-X battery and ESC are designed to work together to support full battery braking.  The V4 Battery is wired differently.  When the L3-X ESC attempts to do full battery braking with a V4 battery, the ESC cannot properly divert the regenerative current.  This fries the ESC.

Riders are advised to  never use V4 batteries in L3-X drives.

The factory never used Loctite on the screws.  Loctite disolves and weakens ABS.  ABS tends to fail shortly after.

One customer is known to have used loctite when installing the longer screws and his ABS posts crumbled within days.

The longer screws from the  factory were not an effective solution and may have actually made the problem worse becasue more torque is required to tighten them so damage to the posts during assembly became more likely.

Until the Stainless Steel Reinforcement kits are available, riders should use a large velcro strap to hold the ABS Shell and battery to the Base plate.

oh wait a minute... i thought the long screws had to do with the hub caps or something... judging from the loctite post above with the pictures broken circular plastic things.....  its just the battery compartment that needs longer screws? 

im probably just gonna buy a LX-3 and use either velcro or a metal S shaped bracket to bolt to the deck and then comes up and over the battery to hold it tight against the deck... i dont mind screwing right through the deck im using

also im wondering if theres a way to charge the battery without removing it from the board and docking it on that dock thing? or some kind of regula charging cable i could buy that will do the job..

Correct, the longer screws hold the ABS shell to the aluminum base plate. However, these longer screws were not an effective solution.

Yes, there are lots of ways to bind the ABS shell to the base plate.

I've often thought of cutting the neck off the drive, then mounting the truck to the deck and seperately mounting the electronics case section directly to the deck.  Doing so would result in better ground clearance and better suspension and vibration isolation for the electronics case.  I may make this change to my own board in the future.

Obvoulsly it makes the install a little more complicated compared to just using the standard 4 deck bolts.  But its not that much more complicated.

Hi paul, I`m also interested in ordering a landwheel L3-x together with you guys. Is it still available now?

i play longboard before and just became an esk8er with my boosted board two months ago.
i`ve been dreaming about a esk8 drive which can turn my favorite decks into esk8 board easily and practically. According to the very informative posts from all of you guys, i think the landwheel l3-x is what i want in spite of the remaining few issues for the battery case.

for now, the best price i can find in the us is more than 500 usd on ebay and wondering if i can get one at a more reasonable price. I check on alibaba and find there are cheaper ones but with minimal order for 10 pcs. So wondering if i can order it together with other people.

btw, the story of the volunteer landwheel beta testers you shared is very impressive and positive, which also gives me significant confidence to try this "product in processing" ,lol.

Today, I hit 48.1 Kph on the 4WD L3-x.

I had a chance to go for my first warm weather ride on the 4WD L3-X.  I went for an hour long run with my son riding the  G1 boosted board dual, my daughter's boyfriend on the G2 boosted board dual + and me on the 4WD L3x.

Warm weather makes all the difference.  I did 10KM on just one battery dot even though I was accellerating hard, up hill, down hill and top speed.  We cut the ride short becasue the boosted boards were down to half battery at the 5KM mark.

The range and roll-on acceleration of the 4wd L3-x in warmer weather is so far beyond the zero degree weather experience.  I'm blown away.

On a gentle down hill section, I hit 48.1 kph.  

Top speed handeling was amazing but note that I swapped out the standard L3-x bushings with Bones Medium high performance cone bushings on the top and KHIRO Barrel Bushings on the bottom.  Without this mod, I would not have felt safe riding the L3-X above 33KPH.

![image|608x500](upload://dnBOYiEIaD2R4nR3lh9J7QCSguX.jpg)


Here is the map my ride chart.

![image|359x500](upload://v27qhZQXd279CKNXJwPifJ8foMs.jpg)

I also raced the boosted board+ G2 on an up hill section.  The BB+G2 rider weighs 165.  I weigh 225.  This is just the first 30 seconds of the race before the boosted board hit its top speed and I disapeared into the distance.  

https://youtu.be/75tDNYPxOxE

The map my ride charts don't show the uphill race becasue my Iphone was standing still doing the filming.

I'l try to get some better race footage and charts tomorrow.

We left for this ride with no SD card in the Go-pro.  I won't make that mistake tomorrow.

Now to be fair to the Boosted Board  the steering on the boosted board is noticibly more precise.   I attribute the precision to the wider trucks, smaller wheels and lower center of gravity on the Boosted board.

My 4WD L3-x is higher off the ground due in part to the larger landwheel wheels but also due to the half inch rubber risers that I use to absorb vibration.  While those risers cost me some handling, I finished the 55  minute long ride without any vibration numbess in my feet.  The much younger G2 Boosted board+ rider finished the ride commenting about how numb his feet felt.

However, without the 1/2 inch rubber risers on the 4WD L3-X the vibration levels would have been comparable to or slightly higher than the Boosted Board. So the vibration differences are primarily due to mounting choices.

And while the price of two Landwheels and a Vanguard deck is close to that of a boosted board, its not really fair to compare accelleration and top speed of a 2000 watt boosted board to a 4400 watt 4WD L3-x.

A final point of fairness to the boosted board is that the product quality, assembly and durability are perfect. Both boosted boards arrived perfect and performed that way for 3 years (G1) and 2 years (G2).  I've had no battery failures or any other type of failure on the boosted boards.  Landwheels have yet to earn that type of reputation.

So definitley this is not an apples to apples comparison.  I'm just saying a 4WD L3-X can do some pretty cool things for a very heavy rider who wants great brakes, great acelleration, long range and lots of flexibilty for deck length, and other mounting options.

My plan for tomorrow is to finally mount the extended range battery on the Boosted board G2+.  Boosted board has sent me extra risers.  The Extended range battery is very thick compared to the stock battery.  So the extra risers are recommended to give the battery proper clearance.

When those changes are done, we can take both boards for a super long ride.

Update on Landwheel Shell failure Solution.

The beta test team recommended a stainless steel retrofit solution to prevent the ABS Shell failures.  After consulting with engineers, Landwheel has decided to go with a different solution.  They are switching from an ABS plastic to a polycarbonate.  Most motorcycles helments are made from polycarbonate.  Polycarbonate has high impact resistance and much more density, flexibility and structrural integrity than ABS.  

Landwheel shared some 6 foot  drop test videos with me.  The L3-x with the new shells survived the drop test.

I'll keep you posted on when the stronger shells will be available.

Until then, any ABS shell Landwheel needs to be reinforced with one or two heavy duty velcro straps.

<hi there! I have been using the Landwheel L3 for some time, and now switched to the L3-X... Sadly. That only caused issues so far. The first one stopped working after i used the break (battery was fully charged).. Could never turn it back on again, I got a new one luckily, that one broke after a week or two, the ABS Battery Case fell off... (I have read that problem happened many times by now). Well, I fixed that by using longer screws its still in one piece for now. But since today, the weird fan (i think it is a fan) doesnt stop making its weird noise. 
Even when the board is turned off! As soon as the battery is inserted, this L3-X "idling cycle" sound starts. Does anyone know what is causing that sound, and why it doesnt stop unless i pull out the battery?

Thanks and also this is my first post here, sorry i dont have anything other to contribute..

Hey! Huh.. good to know! I do have and use a V4 battery too, yes.. but after reading this, I'll better not use it anymore.
However, at the moment, no matter which battery I use, when fully charged the breaking doesn't work. It shuts down or almost dies when doing so -
And the weird sound issue right now also doesn't stop no matter what battery i put in. Do you think because I've used the V4 battery already, that the ESC is damaged at this point? (I mean the board does basically work its just the fully charged braking issue, and since today the noise that doesn't stop no matter the board is on or off....)

Fred:

You need a new ESC and a replacement PCB shell.  I can help you get set-up with both if you can wait a few weeks.  Where do you live?  I don't work for Landwheel but I'm helping fellow riders to get thier units back up and running with the right list of parts.

Here are a few answers to your questions

The ESC is likely to be damaged under two conditions:

a) Braking with a fully charged V4-battery (because there is no place for the Regenerative current to go)
b) Battery ejection due to large bump or ABS Shell failure (Regen current from the motors can't be dissipated into the ejected battery.

You had both experiences so take your pick as to which event damaged your ESC.

You may also need a replacement terminal block depending on whether you have a V4 that was upgraded to an L3-x or if your unit was ordered and arrived as an L3-x.  If it arrives as an L3-x then you do not need any extra parts.

If you received it as a complete L3-x then you just need the Shell and the ESC.


Please note that the longer screws were not an effective solution.  In fact, the longer screws actually caused more damage to the ABS screw posts and resulted in earlier failures.  Failures of the shell are very dangerous because if one out of three motor wires becomes disconnected then the result is instant motor lock that can throw you on the pavement.  For this reason any riding of a landwheel with an ABS Shell should be done only after taking the precaution of fashioning one or two Velcro straps.  If you skim this thread, you will find a video that I posted on tuning up the landwheel with a wheel radius and Velcro straps.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/landwheel-l3-x-reviews/45697/60

Another caution that you should be aware of is that a damaged Landwheel ESC tends to over deplete the L3-x batteries.  If L3-x batteries fall below threshold, they will not take a new charge.  So this is another reason to stop using the landwheel until you get replacement parts. Naturally, don't leave your battery mounted in the drive as you have already observed that your ESC does not power down.

I should have a batch of the new PCB shells in my hands in about 2 weeks.  Landwheel has them on hand and will be shipping them to me sometime this week.  I've volunteered to perform a series of drop tests and rough road tests and to inspect the condition of the posts after those tests.  I will also be trying a few different screw lengths and configurations to see if there is an optimal screw to work with the new PCB shell.

When I'm done with that, then the team at landwheel can make the decision to ship more broadly than to the beta test team (of which I am a volunteer member).

The last thing that I'll point out is that an alternative to getting the parts that I've outlined above is the option of receiving a complete replacement unit fully assembled with a new warranty.  That option is not free and the shipping is not free.  However, you would end up with a new fully assembled unit and lots of spare parts from your original.  You end up with extra battery, charger, wheels, motors, etc.  It‚Äôs an offer that is technically only open to the beta testers.

Dear pkasanda,

Thank you so much for this super detailed post and answering all questions, and the offer as well!
I did also contact landwheel, got a response, and now waiting for the next one. As soon as i got the final response from them, I can let you know whether i still need the replacement parts or not. 

So does this mean the new PCB shells aren't officially on sale yet? (or not officially in the set when you buy a full set)? 
Also becoming a beta tester sounds pretty cool. I think I'd love to be part of that, if they are looking for more testers I guess.

Thanks again for your time and your reply, as mentioned, i will wait for the landwheel response first and then let you know hopefully within a week. I really appreciate your help!

I will talk to you soon,
Fredi

I took my 4WD L3-x for a massive 22km ride today.  On Friday, I bought my wife an electric bike (Trek) that has a 70 km range.  

She wants to ride it to work on the Ottawa bike paths so we tested the route out.  I packed two extra batteries in her saddle bags and off we went.  We followed the river heading down stream so gravity was on my side for most of the first 11km (before doubling back).  But at the 10km mark, I ascended a slope that climbed from 45m above sea level to 85 feet above sea level (from the river shore up to the top of Parliament Hill).  The 40m rise follows a path winds 150 up Parliament Hill for an average grade of 26%.  But I swear, portions of the path were pretty close to 45 degrees (50% grade).  The 4WD landwheel easily accelerated my 225 pound weight like the hill was not there (and like as if I was on a full battery).  I wish I could have videotaped it but the twists, turns and pot holes needed my full attention.

Here is the base of the climb:
https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.4230321,-75.7052384,3a,75y,153.76h,75.94t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1DVR6jgj_ChWQhPs_sFIWg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656

and a 3D view:

![image|690x467](upload://5AUietIht5GhZz9fuDbKCE9vj7h.jpg)

And here is the map my ride elevation chart.

![image|475x500](upload://d3A1zrXtB4T9DH0DO8GfT930syM.png)

The green circles are the base of the climb by the river.  The red circle is the top of Parliament Hill.  The Orange circle is the 14.94 kilometer mark where I stopped to change batteries.

So from the top of Parliament Hill/Supreme court plateau, (11km) we turned around and headed back the same path that got us there.  I charged up my batteries a few dots on the way back down Parliament Hill.  The braking on the steep slope was spectacular.  I had complete control of my downhill speed.  Then 4 more kilometers of minor hills until the battery swap.

The 4WD Landwheel is not perfect.  It really needs a pair of battery balance wires to avoid draining one battery more than the other.  I think my double remote union part allows the remote posts to shift off center during the ride. Then one remote becomes dominant and drain it's drive faster. So without the battery balancing wires I need to watch the battery lights much more than I'd like to.  And near the end of my range, I worry that one Landwheel is going to initiate the low battery braking curve.  So I'm going to try to add the battery balancing wires (simple jumper cables) this week.

I've been riding with my tether.  It's just a dog leash tied to the back of the deck and a neoprene covered carabineer to improve the grip and comfort.  I've added them to all of my boards.

![image|513x500](upload://zkFkch3OzuNDpUmHeNKN3fGKwFC.jpg)



It‚Äôs amazing.  I have to do a video on this.  The benefits are huge.   Added balance.  I can lean forward into acceleration and pull myself back for deceleration.  Crossing roads, I can just hop off and pull the board behind me without having to stoop. When I'm crossing an intersection and the curb is too tall to rise over, I just hop off and let the board climb the curb without my weight.  This dog leash thing is the greatest electric skateboarding invention ever I swear.

Speaking of dog leashes -- not just one but two different dogs lunged at my groin on this trip.  Once right in the middle of this narrow wooden pedestrian bridge.  

![image|334x500](upload://azvxYyWPfDQ6PhT184DOwA6AS1i.jpg)
https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.4137596,-75.7198137,3a,75y,95.89h,72.82t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipMuctAxrZ48pHSluA0qcM2oE59VHBMj7MMEQVfS!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMuctAxrZ48pHSluA0qcM2oE59VHBMj7MMEQVfS%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya192.72011-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352

The owner was walking towards me coming the other way with a leashed yellow lab and as I passed him he lunged.   He missed my groin with his teeth by less than 4 inches. Then it happened again closer to home with a black lab on a residential street.  It‚Äôs the kind of surprise that could easily make you lose your balance and hit the pavement.  But my tether kept me upright while I pulled my midsection out of harm‚Äôs way.  It‚Äôs hard to explain how the tether helps to anchor and re-center your body.  Losing my balanceon that pedestrian bridge could have thrown me over the guard rail and into the river.

https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.4138352,-75.7194381,3a,75y,285.91h,67.23t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1secmI0uz0I_uqXmFR6X0-YA!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo0.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DecmI0uz0I_uqXmFR6X0-YA%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D197.87364%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656

So to jump to the conclusion of this 22km trip, I arrived back home with ample battery on my second pair of batteries.  The max range for 2 batteries seems to be 15km (30 km for 4 batteries).  That might go up a bit with balancing wires.  Also, there were a lot of hills and quite a bit of stop and go because the bike paths have a lot of pedestrians that walk in pairs and don't seem too care much about the bi-directional bike traffic traveling at 20 -30 kph.

Oh and by the way, I combined a V4 battery with a V2 ESC and Hubs to implement what I call virtual suspension on a rigid kick tail deck.  

![image|690x346](upload://u2CPqhUART1XdK5zoEv8R43qXmq.jpg)

It‚Äôs pretty cool.  I can ride it over side walk expansion joints and float right over top of the cracks.  I am planning on doing something similar to keep the 4WD landwheel from getting its wheels caught in some of the massive cracks that are so prevalent on Ottawa streets.  The V2 did not work at all with its original 29 volt battery.  But it‚Äôs surprisingly competent when powered by a 42 volt V4 battery.  Its neat to have an E-board with a kick tail.  I wish the pavement quality was better in my neighborhood though because a rigid deck combined with crappy heavily dimpled pavement is hard on the knees and ankles.  I might add my 1/2 inch anti-vibration pads.  Also I'm thinking of adding a second battery -- though that might make the front end too heavy for tic-tacking around the corners.

And I did a few cool things with my Boosted board G2 plus.  I mounted the extended range battery which came with taller risers.  But I saw a big problem.  The extended range battery is massive in height.  I think it‚Äôs a half inch thicker and the risers only add a quarter inch.  So I ditched the Boosted board risers and added my own half inch rubber risers.  

![image|612x500](upload://lpipTU43UlkLA7nkR3zIM8JgjQI.jpg)

The vibration reduction is impressive but the responsiveness of the steering has taken a big hit.  The sharp drifting turns that I use to be able to do are not really available any more.  So it‚Äôs a tough trade off.  But the thickness of the extended range battery is a real issue.  I estimated that even with the oversized risers, I'd be scrapping the battery almost constantly.  

So before "hitting the road" I decided to make a stainless steel skid plate for it.  

![image|629x500](upload://dt9K0ledfSODLAdESqmFcbeEKN.jpg)

This took me a few hours of metal forming.  It's not a project for the light hearted.  It was a 4 hour effort.  It really works well.  I actually do bottom out and scrape at least 2 - 3 times on a 5 kilometer run. The stainless steel skid plate takes all the abuse.  It‚Äôs glued in place with a checker board application of foam tape, silicone and hot glue.

As I mentioned, I added the dog leash tether to the boosted board.  The dimensions of the boosted board and the tether length make it so I can clip the carabineer to the front truck and the tether makes a perfect carrying strap. The G2 Plus is so comfortable to carry like this.

![image|480x500](upload://z9NPp0cawMnx7gO2rrzHEsCL2qi.jpg)


Tether !  Tether !  Tether !  Tether !

You gotta try it.

Hi everyone, I'm a landwheel owner V5 L3x and have just spent a very rewarding hour poring over this thread.  Most of the fixes I've sort of got to on my own (fairly new to this forum) but its still been a great help.  thanks..
I love this drive, it out performs practically everything else out there for a fraction of the cost.
Range has been an issue but with multiple batteries that is not something worth noting, I do love the fact that if you have an even number of batteries you can always get home and don't get caught out by lying battery indicators (theres always uber)
Mine does cut out under heavy load (and I am a fairly heavy load lol) and being a diyer its perfectly understandable that the bms cuts in to protect the battery when it senses voltage sag (these are small batteries after all), to compensate i just throttle down when attacking hills and the problem doesn't occur.
I will definitely use the wheel bevelling hack as mine are badly chunking and every replacement has done the same so thanks again!  
I took my drive apart after my first ride to check it all out as it was so quick I wanted to be sure It was put together properly and noticed the screw issue so changed them all out with longer from my RC parts bin and they've been fine for 4 months and a lot of ks so far but what i did do that was slightly different to you guys was stop the battery rattling in the case. I know from experience that vibration is the biggest cause of mechanical failure and so I used a sheet of adhesive velcro in the case and the battery and it holds it snug with very little movement.  Does make it a bit harder to get the battery out but not a real drama.
What i really wanted to know though before this comment turned into war and peace was 4WD?
Is this a factory specific thing or a DIY hack? Can you purchase another drive and sync it to one remote?  I tried their website but for some reason I cant access it  
Anyway thanks again for such an informative thread and I will keep you posted on any issues that come up as I use this thing very hard and most days and living in Aus all year round too.

It funny that you arrived at the Velcro hack on your own.  If you watch my latest video I show what is probably the exact same Velcro hack.  

The new PCB shells seem to shrink out of the mold so there is no longer room for the Velcro and the battery is held very tightly.  

I'll be performing some drop tests and other testing on the shells this week. I'm also going to be trying a variety of screw lengths because I too estimate the prevailing screws are too short.

The 4WD is definitely an end user hack.  Landwheel has not been successful in synchronizing remotes.

If you watch the various 4WD videos in this thread, you'll see one method of harnessing the two remotes together.  The best double sided tape to use is Acrylic tape for mounting mirrors.  You can find it in home depot with other double sided tapes. 

I recommend this one:
https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/p.no-more-nails-mounting-tape.1000406813.html

If you use a lesser double sided tape, the remotes can slide around causing one drive to work harder than the other.  Then the batteries get out of balance.  If the foam tape is strong, the batteries deplete very evenly.

Back to the longer screws... longer screws were of limited help with the ABS shells.  In fact longer screws often contributed to the splitting of the posts.  So definitely use a Velcro strap to hold things together until you get your new shell.  Also inspect below the battery cover frequently to make sure none of the wires have slipped between the ABS shell and the aluminum backing plate. This can happen to the antenna wires or the senor wires and damage to the wires can happen as a result.

Hi Guys. First off, big thanks to pkasanda and the forum for the tips on the wheels and velcro straps! I sanded a profile onto the wheels and it fixed the chunking. Glad I found the video from pkasanda :)

I bought my L3-X Unit on the 12th of May. I was told the unit is PC and not ABS after asking them. My batteries both came with no blue stickers. I was told they are the newest and not to worry. As in the video above, without a comparison, its impossible to tell if its a new or old unit.

My issue is range and the safety of the Landwheel. I have been flung off it 3 times already.

The batteries only last less than 2 miles on high mode. They then die and I have to take the battery out, put it back in and restart it. After that I can only ride in low mode without it switching off. At this stage its super slow and I can then get the 5 miles of range. (By slow I mean I could jog faster).

Also, on a few occasions, while in high speed mode, the board had cut out and flung me off! Was flung off today going 19MPH! Fun times....

Is there anyone else having these issues? if so how did you fix them? I would really appreciate any help on this topic as I no longer trust the unit. Feels like I should of bought the Onan, backfire or koowheel instead of the Landwheel.. Pity as I want to like and enjoy it.

So inside the beta-testers thread, I left you an absoloutley massive post with a bunch of diagnostics to go through.  As I was writting those diagnostics, I came up with the most likely scenarios that would explain your limited range and the 100% brake lock that threw you the board.

First its normal for a brand new L3-x battery to have low capacity that starts off as low as 2 miles.  Over a number of charge cycles, that should build to about 4 - 6 miles. However, if you are a very heavy rider, in a neighborhood wiht lots of hills, then 2 miles or so could be a natural limit for a single landwheel.  The batteries are small and range depens a great deal on rider weight and temperature.  Cold weather knocks the range down to below 2 miles for certain. The best solution for very cold weather or very heavy rider or lots of hills is a 4WD landwheel configuration.

Now back to your brakes locking on you.  Every electic skateboard has limits when it comes to down hill braking.  Boosted boards and Onewheels can cut-out completely.  Most chinese boards will either cut-out completely or lock the brakes to prevent over charge when down hill braking on a full battery.  Boosted board and onewheel recommend walking down hill some distance, then traveling up hill to burn off some current before turning around to travel down hill.  It works.  I've tried it on my One wheel.  When you get the over charge warning from any board when traveling down hill, its time to stop the board and head up hill.  If you don't do that, you are putting your life at risk.

So when I looked at your post and studied it for a long time and put all the pieces together, I see this:
- Lives at the top of a hill and heads down hill on a full battery
- Might be a heavy rider (assumption due to low range)
- Might be a colder climate (assumption due to low range)
- Travels down hill at very high  speed
- Ignores the over charge vibration warning when traveling down hill

So I'm not saying you are foolish.  It took me a while to piece all this together.  But I'm thinking the BMS is signalling the ESC that the batteries are at risk of overcharge and the ESC is locking the brakes to prevent an explosion.  

Sucks for you that you get thrown from the board at high speed.  However, the scenaio is avoidable and preventable if you are aware of a few facts: 

The landwheel is able to support down hill braking by slightly undercharging the battery.  The battery leaves the charger with a limited amount of spare capacity for regen current and down hill braking.  When you reach that limit the remote vibrates.  Don't ignore the vibration alert becasue if you do, bad things can happen including damage to the ESC or worse, damage to you.  If you are going to head down hill on a freshly charged battery, then do so at very low speed.  This will reduce the force of the Regen and give you more time to stop if you get a vibration alert.  If you are a very heavy rider and the landwheel brakes can't limit your down hill speed, then a 4WD configuration will give you the brakes you need for your situation.

See my post in the private forum for more diagnostics and some ideas to make things safe for you given your "top of the hill" environment.  If you are not willing to use the walk down, and ride up, before riding down method, then you may need to build a custom board and configuring it to use e-braking (no regen current)  Without the regen, you may need a larger battery.  

A 4WD landwheel configuration may also help you if indeed you are a heavy rider in a cold climate who lives at the top of a large hill.

Here is a better way to identify the PC shell.

The polycarbonate shrinks alot as it exits the mold.  So your battery should fit in the drive very tight with no play.  If you have 1 - 2 mm of play front to back then it's an ABS shell.  Also, the PC shell will have two vertical shrink marks that line up with the screw posts on the side of the drive.  The shrink marks look like this:

![image|690x191](upload://n3fKk0tAFN19WfiuDZiP168o0th.jpg)

To confirm the battery type, try the wiggle test that is shown in the video.

Hi Paul.

Thanks for taking the time to respond and to help out, really appreciate it!
Without your videos I would of bought another board to be honest. The fix for the wheels is just brilliant!

Just had a look at the shades of black and the shrink marks. It is the new polycarbonate shell I have. Might still keep a velcro strap on it, any extra support is good with these hard plastics.

The area above the hole where you have the battery latch, did you put a metal plate over that?

With the battery, I actually did that test already and it seems to be the new ones. Although with the issues I am having, they might have faulty BMS's I suspect.

I have been thinking about getting one of my batteries redone by a friend  who builds custom electric bikes and battries. He could fit in 11 lithium ion Tesla battery's and a new BMS. As I don't trust the current battery anymore (Cut out on a full charge going 19MPH on a flat road and flung me off the board), it might be worth doing. These batteries also only last around 1.5 miles on high mode - thereafter you have to unplug them, replug them and ride in the low mode for the remaining 3.5 miles at a max speed of 9mph.
```

```
So if your brake lock experience is unrelated to downhill braking then:

1) Check for pinched wires as per my post in the beta test forum
2) Check that all 6 motor wires are well connected.  A single disconnected motor wire will lock the wheel on any electric skateboard.  So try to rule out any intermittent connection due to a bad solder or loose connector.  Also make sure there is no damage to any of the motor wires from any of the six screws that hold down the ESC cover plate.

If none of the above problems exists I would contact landwheel and request a replacement battery.  Assuming you are not extrordinarily heavy, riding near zero temperatures, or climbing and decending hills constanlty then your range shold be in the 4-6 mile range on a landwheel (after 10 - 15 charge cycles). 

Be careful mixing the Landwheel ESC with non-L3x batteries. The risk of frying the ESC would be high.

Hi @pkasanda, I am a landwheel owner since the beginning of 2018 and recently I got thrown off the board when the battery is about 75% (3 lights) on a flat ground, do you mind helping me with sending the diagnostic that I need to do? I fell of at 10 mph, not too bad, but got open wound across my arm :frowning: not sure what to do now, a little bit scared to jump back to the board.

Before I was thrown off, I sensed something wrong with the board because the brake didn‚Äôt engaged fully.
I was riding at 20 km/h, hit the brake, the board slows down (braking) until the speed is +/- 5 km/h and i lose the braking power even though my slider is still at the bottom position causing the board to continue cruising at slow speed. Have you ever experienced similar problem?

It seems like a failing battery.  I've not had this experience with an L3-x.  However, I continue to ride one of my V2 Landwheels combined with V4 battereis.  One of those V4 batteries has ample capacity.  The second one has difficulty accelerating and often lacks the power to brake.  So I've stopped using it.

I'll invite you to the beta testers group.  We can discuss your battery further in that forum.

[/quote]

My 4WD has two different clamping systems.  The front unit is an earlier design.  It consists of a latch plate and a clamping arm.  So yes, that unit has a plate similar to a strike plate on a deadbolt.

The second unit is a newer design where the clamping arm doubles as a skid plate.  This clamping system has no strike plate.

Here is an improved 4WD remote design (top).

Improvements:
1) Longer so its easier to get the USB cable into the rear remote
2) Wider slider to enable access hole to front remote power switch
3) Extra thumb tab
4) Post stopper above the rear remote post.  This stops the slider from sinking down and creating friction on the top surface of the rear remote

![image|690x347](upload://54mFpcd3jzIC2JD1qvD76bii0Sh.jpg)



Note that you need to use a heat gun to curl the slider at the bottom.  
The curve prevents friction contact between the slider and the top of the remote.

![image|690x363](upload://jh1rWQtz0zxa1NSFy6N1Ni2K4GB.jpg)

If you don't have a precision tip for your heat gun, then use aluminum foil to shield the material on either side of where you need to bend it.

Hi guys,

I have been riding my Landwheel L3X for about a month or so, got two batteries and both have worked fine, switching them on my way back. But today one of them just died on me. And it would not start again. I plugged in my other battery and was able tog et back home, i charged the failing battery until the light turned green, but still same problem. This time it turned on, but as soon as i started rolling it turned of and would not start again. Tested with the functioning battery again, and it still works. Any suggestions or ideas on what to do? Could it just be a warranty case?

best
Vilhelm

Batteries do fail from time to time.  Sometimes its spontaneous.  Other times is seems to be a result of riding the batteries down to the last drop.  

I've had two batteries fail.  Since then I've changed my riding habits.  I swap in a fresh battery as soon as I hit the last blue dot.  Since then I've had no battery failures.  I've also ordered extra batteries so I'm never tempted to streatch out a battery.

I recommend ordering two extra batteries and asking for a warranty replacement on a third.

Yes, of course, I don't think i have been ever riding them to the last drop, except maybe once.

"I swap in a fresh battery as soon as I hit the last blue dot" So you only ride 50% of the battery? Or do you mean the last red dot? An still just ride about 75% of the battery then?

Hopefully they replace my battery without ordering an extra, two of them has been plenty, as long as they work. I seldom ride longer than 8-10 km so i usually last one battery on the way out and the other on the way back.

One of my hub motor wheels are also starting to feel just a tad bit loose, it is not really loose but it does wiggle a little bit more than the other one. Are they easy to open and tighten? And as a custom build, do you think it is possible to change the back truck on the landwheel? I swapped the front one for a proper longboard truck and the experience is so much nicer, would be fun to try the back one to!

My tips on battery usage were more to help you get better results in the future.  I was not suggesting you had abused the battery.

That said, I now swap in a fresh battery within minutes of dropping to one blue dot lit.  I don't wait for it to flash and I never wait til I hit the red dot only.  I also pay attention to the vibrations in the remote.  If it vibrates up hill on a reatively full battery, I back off the throttle.  If it vibrates on two blue dots then I get ready for a battery swap if it happens a second time.

On the extra batteries, I still suggest you pick up an extra one or two.  The beta testers get a special price on batteries.  I can invite you to the discussion if you want to know how low that price is.

Loose hub motors are very easy to tighten but there are two different components that may need to be tightened.  The simplest is the axle nut.  Just remove the hub cap and tighten the axle nut.  Its even better to remove the axle nut, apply loctite, then re-torque the axle nut.

If that does not fix your wabble, then remove the four outer lug nuts, then loosen and retorque the inner lug nuts. Tighten them incrementally using quarter turns in an alternating pattern just like the proper method for torquing lug nuts on a car wheel.  Then re-insert and re-torque the outer lug nuts.

I do not believe you would be sucessful in swapping the rear trucks unless you have a lathe to turn down the truck to the diameter of the inner bearing and a milling machine to cut a slot for the motor wires.

If you want an effect similar to wider trucks then try doubling up the truck on the rear end.  Watch this video for an illustration.

Hi @pkasanda. Thanks again for the response.

I wanted to do more testing before I replied. Of the 2 batteries I have, the issue is the second battery I purchased from Landwheel. It lasts no longer than 1 mile. For some reason it also causes the board to fling me off. This issue is unrelated to downhill braking or anything related as I am 80kg and I there are no hills here where I did my tests.

I have since emailed land wheel but they are really dragging there feet even after I sent a video of the battery going flat under a mile from a full charge. Its a pity really.

Unrelated to the battery issue, I want to warn people that they need to tighten all the screws/ bolts on there units and wheels periodically. Mine became very very loose. I had to unscrew the housing and re screw down the screws for the power supply and esc board as it all came loose. When I re attached the housing I noticed a screw that holds it down won't tighten. The housing screws hole is damaged too - kinda falling apart! Think the velcro idea even with the new housing is a must. also, the wheels came loose.

Anyway, hope your are well and not having issues your side. Thanks for the help and information, it has helped out loads.

Hi Byron:

It looks like you have confirmed a theory about the sudden braking.  If a battery is deffective then this could result in a sudden extreme voltage drop or power loss. The ESC may react to the drastic voltage drop or power loss in a way that locks the brakes. 

I'll reach out to Jason on your behalf concerning a replacement battery.

On the topic of the plastic housing, are you certain that you have the polycarbonate version?  Do you know how to tell the difference.  The polycarbonate version shrinks a lot after it leaves the mold.  So the battery fit is tight and there is no back and forth play for the battery.  You should also see two large vertical shrink marks on each side of the plastic housing.  These shrink marks line-up with the screw posts.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/3X/a/1/a1902a841a6707f2b1c1a5a278524f48ffe250d7_1_690x191.jpg

You have described two things that are consistent with the ABS shells (post failure and a loose fit for the battery.  If you don't see large vertical shrink marks, its very likely you do not have the repacement PC shell.  The ABS shell is dangerous as it can fail completely.

On the urethane quality on the rear wheels, yes, they are a bit slippery and the life expectancy is shorter than the front wheels.  The defficiencies of the motor wheel urethane never bothered me too much becasue the replacement wheels are cheap and spares are included in the box, There are a few work arounds to give you better traction and longer wear including:
- switch to front wheel drive
- set-up a 4WD system
- double up the trucks  (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/landwheel-l3-x-reviews/45697/138)
- Put a large radius on the edges of the motor wheels.

I ride a 4WD configuration almost exclusively and I've doubled up the truck on both front and back.

Hi again.

Thanks for the help. Well got another nice surprise while taking pictures of the unit. Its defiantly PCB but the build quality seems very poor and the shell is coming apart.

(images won't upload to site)

The screws just don't hold all that well. Really sad to see the unit like this already. Ill need to take it apart and try fix it somehow. Will need to add the velcro too to try keep it all together.

As for the urethane quality, as much as it might be an issue, I think the unit won't last as long as a pair unfortunately :frowning:

Byron:

Thanks for sending me the pictures.  I can almost guarantee you that you have an ABS Shell.  The ABS shells have very small shrink marks relative to the polycarbonate shells.  Your posts have split exactly like the ABS shell posts.  The Polycarbonate shells have zero play in the battery compartment and there is no room inside the battery compartment for a strip of Velcro.

The shrink mark on your pictures are exactly like those on my ABS shells.  Much shorter, very shallow.  They appear closer to the top of the shell and do not extend below the midpoint.  

Compare the polycarbonate shrink marks on my image to those on your image.

![image|690x191](upload://ngoLRXfRZRbAglkQds9S3qGMQhc.jpg)

![image|690x359](upload://vfk3CUTsNbVVD4SIQbaHeKywaLk.jpg)

One more indicator that your shells are ABS is the absence of a wet film on the disassembled underside of the shell.  The polycarbonate shell slowly secretes a liquid.   I‚Äôm not sure if it is an oil or a solvent.  I think it‚Äôs an oil. The liquid accumulates on the surfaces that are in direct contact with the aluminum base plate.  On other surfaces, the liquid is not visible.  I assume it evaporates.

I‚Äôve tested the polycarbonate shells on some very rough roads and inspected the posts afterwards.  The posts were in perfect condition.

So if I'm right about your current shell being ABS, your replacement should be very durable.  At the same time it is disappointing that what you were told was a polycarbonate shell is almost certainly an old ABS shell.

Things like that should not happen.

[/quote]

Use some agressive tape or hot glue to fasten the antena wire out of harms way. Fasten it in 2 - 3 places. If you don't do this, the antena wire is very likley to slip between the ABS shell and the Aluminum backing plate.  If that happens, the antenna wire could be damaged and likely could not be repaired.

Hi Paul.

Thanks for reviewing the imagery. I thought it might have been PCB as landhweel told me it was along with there being no space between the battery and housing. I know on the older one you mentioned you needed a piece of material inside to fasten the battery connection.

With the shell being ABS, I actually wonder if the batteries supplied re the latest as there was no blue sticker and no way to tell. 

Lets hope they send a replacement and that its PCB. Is there a stronger material one could 3D print?
Also, how long are the screws holding down the housing? They seem very inadequate given there job.

As for the antenna cable, I meant the velcro strap around the housing. 
Many thanks again. Hopefully this information can help out other land wheel users.

I understand where you put the velcro.  Your screw posts are all broken. When the velcro is loose there is an opportunity for the antena wire to slip between the shell and the backing plate.  Then when you tighten the velcro, the wire can get pinched.

I finally completed my testing on the polycarbonate shells.  It's a pass.  I tested it with the original 1/2 inch screws and a set of substitute 3/4 inch machine screws.  Both sets of screws passed two tests:

**Test 1:**
10 kilometers of the worst roads in my neighborhood -- really horrible roads with a hundred teeth rattling /wheel grabbing road cracks.  I made a rig to tow a test board with two Landwheels.  I towed this behind my eight wheeled land wheel.  My eight wheeler floated over the cracks while the test unit took the full impact of the road cracks.  I disassembled the test unit after the road test and found that all of the screw posts were intact and undamaged.

**Test 2:**
I performed a total of 20 drop tests from 5.5 feet on to pavement.  There was no damage to the battery latch on the shell.  I disassembled the test unit after the drop tests and found that all of the screw posts were intact and undamaged.  On the unit with the 1/2 inch stock screws, I found one screw that bent and pulled free of the screw post.  However, the screw post was undamaged.  So it seems that one of the twenty drop tests overwhelmed this one screw.  The 3/4 inch machine thread screws and screw posts were all intact.  I'd also say that battery ejections are unlikely even from a 5.5 foot drop.  My test set-up was a bit stripped down so as to protect the ESC.  I removed the ESC and battery cover and used a small block of Styrofoam SM to take up the slack.  One of my blocks of foam was loose so I had some battery ejections on that one.  However the second drive had a tighter fit with a slightly larger block of Styrofoam.  On that unit, I had zero battery ejections out of all 20 drop tests.  I performed all of the tests with two Landwheel mounted on the test board

**Conclusions:**
The combination of stock 1/2 inch screws and polycarbonate shell seem strong enough to withstand considerable and extraordinary abuse.  I think the 20 drop tests were excessive compared to worst case impacts with road cracks and potholes.

If the roads in your area are reasonably good, the 1/2 inch screws are likely sufficient to prevent any type of shell failure (Damaged screw posts, battery ejections, etc.)

If you travel roads that are bad enough to damage just about any electric longboard, then upgrading to 3/4 inch machine screws is a worthwhile precaution.  These screws are hard to find. You may need to go to a specialty fastener store and you may need to have them special ordered.  I found my 3/4 inch machine screws in Lowes but these screws were horrible quality.  The metal was soft and the slotted screw heads all stripped during the removal process.  So I'd say special order some stainless steel Philips or Robertson screws.

In general, I'd say the possibility of a battery ejection from hitting a crack or pot hole is near zero with the Polycarbonate Shell.  But once again, if you ride the types of roads that could damage just about any brand of electric long board then a Velcro strap is a reasonable precaution to safeguard against a battery ejection.  I would not say this is necessary or essential for the vast majority of riders.  I'm just saying its sensible option if your daily route includes one or more massive cracks or pot holes that you normally ride around or jump over.

14.75 kms  is the longest I've gone on two batteries. Speed was under 32 kph becasue my wife was accompanying me on her electric bike.  The first 10 KM was trending down hill because we followed the ottawa river down stream.  then I climbed a massive 30 - 40 degree hill from the river base to the top of parlaiment hil.  Then turned around and headded 4.75 KM in the opposite direction (upstream). Thats when the remote started vibrating so I swapped in Batteries 3 & 4.

Range is less if I'm accelerating hard or traveling top speed.

What do you want to do:
a) Squeeze 2 foc boxes inside each landwheel?
b) Squeeze 4 FOC boxes inside the Raptor enclosure?
c) Squeeze two Landwheel ESC inside the Raptor enclosure?
d) something else?  

MIke is correct in stating that the landwheel ESC enclosure below the battery lacks the space for 2 vesc or two focbox.  There is not enough height or width.

It sounds like you have a complete raptor except forthe hub wheels.  So in theory, you would want four foc box connected to the Raptor battery.  Since ther  Raptor usually only accomodates 2 FOC box, you need to find space for another 2 FOC box.  Correct?  

Have you thought about an external waterproof aluminum box for 2 FOC box?

What is your plan for the landwheel batteries?  If you left them behind, then you could cap off the landwheel enclosure with an aluminum plate and some silicone.  THat would give you a waterproof enclosure that would easily accomodate 2 foc box  mayby even 4.

The other option would be to relocate two landwheel ESC inside the raptor.  This would power 4 motors.  This won't work if the raptor battery is 52 volts but might work if the raptor battery is 42.5 volts.  The risk is that wiht the raptor battery fully charged, the Landwheel ESC is at risk of damage under any full battery braking conditions.

Super helpful guys, thank you.  

I'll install the new Maytech hubs and 100A ESCs in the R2 as temps, until the next generation of hubs (and the Unity) is out - and leave the Landwheel chopping until another time then. :) Thanks guys.

I have this clear vision of a faster, smoother quad Raptor 2.1 - wearing high-quality rubber racing slicks, using the Raptor 1 deck - that I just can't seem to shake.

when that happens with me, I have to build it

Hi folks, I'm new to the forum, this is my first post. 
(Been hiding in the bushes reading your awesome tips and comments)

I've had my Landwheel l3x v5 for around a month and I'm loving it, i mainly use it for commuting to work each day. 

I have had couple issues you which folks have already discussed (plastic housing stripping and wheels cracking) which I have fixed thanks to your tips and ideas.

One issue I've not seen mentioned is one of my hubs is rattling (the bolt in the middle seems to have come loose).

I've taken the wheel bit off but not been able to tighten the bolt as a normal wrench won't fit around the nut as there's not much space around it. 

I've ordered a set of box spanners to tighten it but was wondering of any if you guys has disassembled the hub motor? And if you think I'd be better disassembling the hub motor then tightening it or if you think the box wrench will work?

Any tips or suggestions would be great. 

Thanks and hello again.

Check the bag of tools that came with your L3-x.  It usually includes a special tool for tightening the hub motor axle nut.  Its a socket wrench with a very thin wall.

If you don't have the tool then it is possible to make one.  Purchase a good quality 13mm 
 or 1/2 inch socket wrench, mount it on a drill or impact wrench and spin it against a running belt sander to grind down the walls of the socket wrench.

You could start with something like this but I think you would still need to grind down the walls thinner

Here is another potential source:
https://www.grainger.com/category/ecatalog/N-/Ntt-thin+wall+wrench

If you want do do things on the cheap, you could grind the plastic off of a skateboard wrench and then grind down the walls of the  axle nut socket as described above.

[/quote]

If you have multiple Landwheel batteries then once you replace the internals on the battery, you could mount two of your modified batteriesin parallel.  I'm not sure if you have spare parts left over from an old V3 or V4.  If you do, wiring the batteries in parallel may give you the capacity you need to prevent voltage sag.

Another approach might be to make an ABS spacer with the same shape as the battery.  You might be able to make the spacer thick enough to to allow for two rows of batteries.  I'm suggesting doubling the height of the battery by making a spacer that sits between the top and bottom halves of the battery case.

Keep in mind that the L3-x has a split terminal on one side.  One terminal is for charging through the BMS.  The other terminal is for powering the Landwheel and for regenerative braking.  I'm not sure if it's true but one person wiht some battery and BMS expertice previoulsy wrote that the second terminal bypasses the BMS and runs straigh to the battery.  

I believe this wiring is important for two reasons:
1) When the L3-x is braking, it needs a battery available to absorb the charge.  If the BMS cuts off the battery and there is no place for the regen current to go then the L3-x ESC can be fried. Bypassing the BMS ensures that the battery is always available

2) This may or may not be true, but the highly responsive acceleration of the L3-x may in part be due to its power being drawn directly from the battery (not via the BMS).

This is how you wire two bateries in parallel.  Positive to positive, negative to negtive, just like boosting a dead car battery.

Obviously you need a second landwheel chasis for this.

Something similar could be done with the battery case.  You do need a few tools including a band saw or scroll saw to cut the ABS, a heat gun (with precision tip) to bend the strip, a solvent applicator and Acetone.  Plastic shops sell the plastic, solvent applicators and they also sell solvent blends that are slightly better at bonding than acetone.

A plastics shop could also cut the strip of ABS fo you if you do not have a saw.

I suppose someone with 3d Design skills and a 3D printer could draw up an upper shell that is deeper than the landwheel battery shell.  Then print it off at the local library.  In Ottawa, the local library lets you do 3D printing for the cost of materials.  Not sure if that service is available in other cities.

**Question Translated to English...**
I'm having the same problem with in my country. 2 km is fine then it gets really dangerous for me. I weigh 220 pounds. My sons have no problems with this board can ride as they want. It never cuts out for them. Anyway I like this board it's one of three that I have. I have a voltage tester mounted and could watch how  the volts go up or down. Teh voltage does not fluctuate much for riders to 70 kg after that really dangerous.

**English response....
(Siehe √úbersetzung nach Deutsch unten)**
Germane:
You are correct. With a heavy rider voltage sag is a problem. Lighter riders don't have this problem.

I also weigh 220 pounds (100 kg).  I find the battery is too small for my weight.  The range is too short.  You never want to ride past the third flashing blue dot.  NEVER ride on the red dot.  The battery can be damaged if you ride the battery past these warnings.

Cold weather also shortens the range.  So the weather in germany may not be helpful this time of year. 

My first solution was to mount two batteries in parallel.  This works well as long as the batteries are from the identical model (L3-x).  The other solution is to mount two drives on one board.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/landwheel-l3-x-reviews/45697/138


The other solution  would be to leave the landwheel for your sons to ride.  Just make sure the battery never drops below the third flashing light.  This will protect the battery from damage. Riding in cold weather is not good for the battery.  The voltage can drop suddenly.

**Translated German Response**
Germane:
Du hast Recht. Bei einem starken Fahrer ist die Durchbiegung ein Problem. Leichtere Fahrer haben dieses Problem nicht.

Ich wiege auch 220 Pfund (100 kg). Ich finde die Batterie ist zu klein f√ºr mein Gewicht. Die Reichweite ist zu kurz. Sie wollen nie √ºber den dritten blinkenden blauen Punkt hinausfahren. Fahre NIEMALS auf dem roten Punkt. Die Batterie kann besch√§digt werden, wenn Sie die Batterie √ºber diese Warnungen fahren.

Kaltes Wetter verk√ºrzt auch die Reichweite. Also das Wetter in Deutschland kann zu dieser Jahreszeit nicht hilfreich sein.

Meine erste L√∂sung bestand darin, zwei Batterien parallel zu montieren. Dies funktioniert gut, solange die Batterien vom gleichen Modell (L3-x) sind. Die andere L√∂sung besteht darin, zwei Laufwerke auf einer Platine zu montieren.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/landwheel-l3-x-reviews/45697/138


Die andere L√∂sung w√§re, das Rad f√ºr Ihre S√∂hne zu verlassen. Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Batterie niemals unter das dritte Blinklicht f√§llt. Dies sch√ºtzt die Batterie vor Besch√§digung. Fahren bei kaltem Wetter ist nicht gut f√ºr die Batterie. Die Spannung kann pl√∂tzlich abfallen.

Awesome Idea. Brilliant! Its great how you can charge one battery right on your board. I think you solution will work well even though your spare battery is wired to the incorrect terminal. The Landwheel has a split negative terminal. One negative terminal is for charging through the BMS. The other negative terminal is for operating the landwheel. The operating terminal bypasses the BMS so that the regenerative current is never disconnected by the BMS. If that were to happen, the ESC can be damaged. Despite that wiring problem, I think your solution will work as long as the main battery is always inserted during operation. Your main battery is connected properly so your regenerative braking current will always have at least one battery to accept the current.  Never ride your modified landwheel without a battery in the drive chasis.  If you ride with the spare battery only, then you risk damage to your ESC during braking.

With some small wiring changes, you could double your regenerative braking capacity.  You could also add a wire so that you could charge both batteries at the same time.  

If you disassemble the charging dock, you will see that the outer black terminal is disconnected. That's the operating terminal.  The inner black terminal is the charging terminal.

![image|690x452](upload://ivMwHMcEsgB9z5pJ7sXhzH3JTmD.jpeg) 

If you disassemble the landwheel drive and remove the shell, you will see that the inner black terminal is disconnected.  That is the charging terminal.

![image|687x500](upload://pL0BxaN0hzUtzl5jOZ3fcWng3YQ.jpeg) 

So if you want both battereis to always be available for regenerative current
And if you want to be able to charge both batteries at the same time...

You would make these three hard wired connections with a soldering iron...
- Negative charging terminal to negative charging terminal
- Negative operating terminal to negative operating terminal
- Red positive terminal to red positive terminal.



![image|441x500](upload://pNHVv0GRtnY41cgAm61bEO1jjK5.jpeg) 


When you plug your charger in to the port on the charging dock, I think both batteries would charge at the same time.

Pkasanda thank you s√≥ much for your feed back. Yes you're right about the regenerative braking but I think it's not worth it because I will always run with both batterys and the regenerative braking is not that efficient, even if we doble it.
In case of charging both batterys, how can I charge both if I unplug the connection between then to insert the  charging port?
To do that I have do make a new plug into the middle battery connections right?  Is also just connect negative to negative and positive to positive? 
Thank you one more time for your amazing response

[quote="Bertolini, post:196, topic:45697"]
the regenerative braking is not that efficient
[/quote]

The benefit would be that you would double the amount of down hill braking that you could do before you get the vibration alert.  If you brake past the vibration alert, you can damage your ESC (or your battery or both). You would be adding more safety and reducing the possibility of damage.

When you leave your destination with two full batteries, its going to take longer for the power levels to drop.  So you need to travel twice as far to get the same down hill braking capacity. Wiring both batteries to the operating port would allow you to safely brake down hill much earlier in your trip.

Also, the regenerative braking is much more efficient than you might think.  It's hard to tell how much battery range you are gaining from regenerative motor power when you have only one remote control.  On my 4WD landwheel, I have not added a battery balancing wire yet.  

So when one battery gets lower than the other, I adjust the remote linkage to put more load on the battery that has more power remaining.  When I do this, the battery in the other drive quickly increases its power level becaue it is being pushed by the other drive.

Under these conditions, comparing battery lights on the two remotes, you can see that the regenerative power recapture is very efficient.  

Also, the power recapture happens not just when braking.  Any time you travel down hill, even a small hill, the motors are adding power to the battery, even when you are not braking.  Braking down hill increases the amount of power going back in to the battery, but your speed and the distance you travel is decreased by the braking.

So your total range is not much different if you brake or don't brake.  But the regenerative properties of the motors are always maximizing your battery range.

Coasting to a slower spead on a flat surface has the same effect as traveling down hill.  So any time you coast or travel down hill, the regenerative power is recharging your battery. 

Braking puts power in to the battery faster but slows you down faster.  So if you compare the same trip with and without braking the range without braking will be a bit longer.  But that's not measuring the efficiency of the regenerative motor power.  Its only measuring the efficiency of coasting vs braking.

[/quote]

So in my proposal, you do not use the charging port to connect the two batteries.  Using the charging port is improper wiring becasue it connects the operating black terminal on the drive to the charging terminal on the dock.

To do the wiring I have proposed, you need to drill some extra holes in the charging dock.  Three wires go directly from the drive unit to the charging dock and all of the connections are soldered and permanent.  

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/3X/b/4/b4d4d411f157b67d771c12089eed0901e62a5c2d_1_441x500.jpeg

This leaves the charging port open when you drive.  When you park and plug in the charging brick, power would travel to both batteries on the red and purple wires.  Both batteries would charge.  Each battery BMS would independently determine when to cut its battery off from the charger.  The charger light would turn green when both battery BMS's have disconnected from the charging terminal.

It would probably take twice as long to charge the batteries.  But overnight charging would be simpler.

Of course, you would still have the option of charging one battery at a time if you remove one battery when charging.

If you omit the purple wire then you would have all of the regenerative braking and safety benefits.  But you would have to charge one battery at a time in the charging dock.

If you decide to follow my wiring instructions, then you might want to invent a plug for the charging port or cover it with electrical tape.  You want to avoid geting moisture and grit into the charging port.  It will corrode quickly during charging if the contacts get scratched by grit or if the surfaces are moist.

Hallo Germene,

Ill respond in english as my german typing is poor.

Im sorry you having issues with your land wheel. I still cannot ride mine, 4 batteries later and a new power button and the thing still does not work. Its a poorly made system (My own opinion). If you still can I would send it back to them and get either a koolwheel or backfire.

If you have energy to tweak the system like others on the thread you could get it to work but as a busy person with a business to run I don't have time to do this. Im still waiting on Landwheel for a solution to the problem other than a refund.

Good luck.

[/quote]

German Translation:

I do not give up ... the engines are super strong vsc and Battery are faulty I'll get it I'll get in touch.

English Response:

Hi Germain:
I understand what you like about the landwheel.  It is certainly not perfect but the acceleration and speed are incredible.  Since you say you want to continue, I would like to help you understand the technical problem with the Landwheel.

There is actually no problem with the ESC.  The ESC is the same ESC that is used in about half of the Chinese boards on the market (hobbywing).  The reason the acceleration is so strong is the Landwheel LIPO battery.  This battery has a discharge rate that is 3x the rate of the Lithium Cell batteries like Samsung and LG.  That discharge rate is why the Landwheel can climb a hill without slowing down or accelerate so much faster than a boosted board.

Unfortunately, the landwheel has a small capacity.  So the fast discharge rate combined with the limited capacity means that the voltage can drop below critical voltage very quickly.  Light riders like your son's don‚Äôt have as many problems because the battery does not have to work as hard and the discharge is slower.

For a heavy rider like you, the range is very short because any acceleration can drop the battery below critical voltage.  The voltage drop can be so sudden that the ESC can stop functioning before it has time to power down.  If that happens, the brakes can be very sudden and too powerful.

Heavy riders like myself and other riders who want more range have fixed their Landwheel by doubling the landwheel battery.  I did that in January 2018 and it worked fantastic.  The ESC performed perfect. Acceleration was stronger.  Range was about 13 kilometers.  I weigh over 100 KG.  May 2018, I converted the landwheel to 4WD.  It works even better than double battery.

The fast discharge rate of the battery causes one other problem.  If riders ignore the vibration alert and continue riding, the battery can be damaged.  Riders should not ignore the vibration alert but they do.  Riders are confused when the vibration alert is activated but then seconds later the landwheel accelerated like it has a fresh battery.  So they keep riding.  I have taken voltage measurements with single battery landwheel.  The ESC is programmed to cause a vibration alert at 36 volts.  However, in the time it takes to remove the battery and test the voltage, the voltage recovers to over 40 volts.  If you insert the battery again, the remote shows the blue lights are on so the rider thinks they can continue past the vibration alert.  This type of riding damages the battery because the voltage keeps bouncing below 36 volts.  Riders don't think they have done anything wrong so they blame the batteries as defective.  However, the proper way to ride a landwheel is to stop at the first vibration alert.

If you double the battery, the problem is solved, even for heavy riders. The discharge rate is cut in half so the voltage does not fluctuate so much.  The vibration alert is not activated until the rider has a long ride and the rider is less likely to continue because the battery indicator remains stable at a low indicator light.  The rider should still stop and change batteries after the first vibration alert.

In my riding group in Ottawa, my 4WD landwheel is the fastest at accelerating, has the fastest top speed and the longest range during the warm summer days.  When the weather is cold like now, my range becomes shorter.  I have raced against Mellow boards and Evolve GT.  They are much slower at accelerating and at top speed.  I have tried a Meepo 4WD.  The landwheel 4wd is much faster.  My brakes are safe.  The Meepo brakes are very dangerous.

So yes, the Landwheel is not perfect.  But if you understand its weaknesses, it can be the most amazing board in any group of riders.

I understand the frustration of people who have landwheel with single batteries.  However, if you really love the way the landwheel accelerates, there is a way to fix it.  If you stop quickly after the vibration alert, the batteries last a long time.  

The story of the landwheel is a bit like the fable of the Turtois and the Hare.  The Turtle lasts longer in the race.  But who wants to accelerate like a turtle on a skateboard when you can accelerate like a rabbit.

Hallo Germain:

Ich verstehe, was dir am Landwheel gef√§llt. Es ist sicherlich nicht perfekt, aber die Beschleunigung und Geschwindigkeit sind unglaublich. Da Sie sagen, dass Sie fortfahren m√∂chten, m√∂chte ich Ihnen helfen, das technische Problem mit dem Landwheel zu verstehen.

Es gibt eigentlich kein Problem mit dem ESC. Der ESC ist der gleiche ESC, der in etwa der H√§lfte der chinesischen Boards auf dem Markt verwendet wird (hobbywing). Der Grund daf√ºr, dass die Beschleunigung so stark ist, ist die Landwheel LIPO Batterie. Diese Batterie hat eine Entladerate, die dreimal so hoch ist wie die der Lithium-Zellen-Batterien wie Samsung und LG. Diese Entladungsrate ist der Grund, warum das Landwheel einen H√ºgel erklimmen kann, ohne langsamer zu werden oder schneller zu beschleunigen als ein Booster.

Leider hat das Landwheel eine kleine Kapazit√§t. Die schnelle Entladungsrate kombiniert mit der begrenzten Kapazit√§t bedeutet, dass die Spannung sehr schnell unter die kritische Spannung fallen kann. Leichte Fahrer wie Ihr Sohn haben nicht so viele Probleme, weil die Batterie nicht so hart arbeiten muss und die Entladung langsamer ist.

F√ºr einen schweren Fahrer wie Sie ist die Reichweite sehr kurz, da jede Beschleunigung die Batterie unter kritische Spannung fallen lassen kann. Der Spannungsabfall kann so pl√∂tzlich auftreten, dass der ESC nicht mehr funktionieren kann, bevor er heruntergefahren werden kann. Wenn das passiert, k√∂nnen die Bremsen sehr pl√∂tzlich und zu stark sein.

Schwere Fahrer wie ich und andere Fahrer, die mehr Reichweite w√ºnschen, haben ihr Landwheel durch Verdoppelung der Landwheel batterie repariert. Ich habe das im Januar 2018 gemacht und es hat fantastisch funktioniert. Der ESC hat perfekt funktioniert. Die Beschleunigung war st√§rker. Die Reichweite betrug etwa 13 Kilometer. Ich wiege √ºber 100 KG. Mai 2018 habe ich das Landwheel auf 4WD umgebaut. Es funktioniert sogar besser als doppelte Batterie.

Die schnelle Entladungsrate der Batterie verursacht ein anderes Problem. Wenn die Fahrer den Vibrationsalarm ignorieren und weiterfahren, kann die Batterie besch√§digt werden. Fahrer sollten den Vibrationsalarm nicht ignorieren, aber sie tun es. Fahrer sind verwirrt, wenn der Vibrationsalarm aktiviert wird, aber Sekunden sp√§ter beschleunigt das Landwheel, als h√§tte es eine frische Batterie. Also fahren sie weiter. Ich habe Spannungsmessungen mit einem Batterieladrad gemacht. Der ESC ist so programmiert, dass bei 36 Volt ein Vibrationsalarm ausgel√∂st wird. In der Zeit, die ben√∂tigt wird, um die Batterie zu entfernen und die Spannung zu testen, wird die Spannung jedoch auf √ºber 40 Volt wiederhergestellt. Wenn Sie die Batterie erneut einlegen, zeigt die Fernbedienung an, dass die blauen Lichter eingeschaltet sind, sodass der Fahrer denkt, dass er den Vibrationsalarm weiterf√ºhren kann. Diese Art des Fahrens besch√§digt die Batterie, weil die Spannung unter 36 Volt springt. Die Fahrer denken nicht, dass sie etwas falsch gemacht haben, also beschuldigen sie die Batterien als defekt. Die richtige Art, ein Landwheel zu fahren, besteht jedoch darin, bei der ersten Vibrationswarnung anzuhalten.

Wenn Sie die Batterie verdoppeln, ist das Problem auch f√ºr schwere Fahrer gel√∂st. Die Entladungsrate ist halbiert, so dass die Spannung nicht so stark schwankt. Der Vibrationsalarm wird nicht aktiviert, bis der Fahrer eine lange Fahrt hat und der Fahrer weniger wahrscheinlich weitermacht, da die Batterieanzeige bei einer niedrigen Anzeigeleuchte stabil bleibt. Der Fahrer sollte nach dem ersten Vibrationsalarm noch anhalten und die Batterien wechseln.

In meiner Reitgruppe in Ottawa ist mein 4WD-Landwheel das schnellste Gaspedal, hat die schnellste H√∂chstgeschwindigkeit und die l√§ngste Reichweite an warmen Sommertagen. Wenn das Wetter kalt ist wie jetzt, wird meine Reichweite k√ºrzer. Ich bin gegen Mellow Boards und Evolve GT gefahren. Sie sind viel langsamer beim Beschleunigen und bei H√∂chstgeschwindigkeit. Ich habe einen Meepo 4WD ausprobiert. Das Landwheel 4wd ist viel schneller. Meine Bremsen sind sicher. Die Meepo Bremsen sind sehr gef√§hrlich.

Also ja, das Landwheel ist nicht perfekt. Aber wenn Sie seine Schw√§chen verstehen, kann es das erstaunlichste Board in jeder Gruppe von Fahrern sein.

Ich verstehe die Frustration von Leuten, die mit einzelnen Batterien Landwheel haben. Wenn Sie jedoch wirklich die Art und Weise lieben, wie das Landwheel beschleunigt, gibt es eine M√∂glichkeit, es zu reparieren. Wenn Sie nach dem Vibrationsalarm schnell anhalten, halten die Batterien lange.

Die Geschichte vom Landwheel ist ein bisschen wie die Fabel des Schildkr√∂te und des Hasen. Die Schildkr√∂te h√§lt l√§nger im Rennen. Aber wer m√∂chte wie eine Schildkr√∂te auf einem Skateboard beschleunigen, wenn man wie ein Hase beschleunigen kann.

I love it on the Vanguard. I chose Flex1.  4WD is spectacular.  So much more traction with the brakes. It out accelerates everything else even when the other rider is half my weight.  Top speed is 48.3 kph and it takes seconds to get there.  

I highly recommend swapping pivot bushings.  Bones Yellow barrel bushings on the bottom.  Yellow Bones Cone bushings on the top.  Watch my videos for instructions on mechanically connecting the remotes together.  I also recommend connecting the two batteries together to balance the power levels.  If you don't, then one drive will run out of power before the other.

Power down as soon as the remote vibrates or within a minute of the third blue dot flashing.  This will protect your battery from damage. Expect about 13 km of range.  Avoid riding in cold weather.  Even with 4WD, the cold weather range is limited and the voltage can drop quickly. 

The roads in my city are horrible so I turned my Vanguard into an 8 wheeled 4WD Landwheel.  Naturally you don't need to do that.  Its an interesting option if you have a band saw and a drill press.

Road vibration is minimized if you isolate the deck between a layer of rubber top and bottom.  You can do it with risers, or you can do it with 3/8 inch rubber flooring material -- the type that often goes on workshop floors.  This tip to reduce vibration works on any electric skateboard.  Landwheel L3-x already has lower vibration than most electric skate boards due to the large wheel diameter, Thick PU on the motor wheels and softer than normal PU on the motor wheels.

Make sure you have the polycarbonate shells.  If you don't, then re-inforce with a velcro strap or metal bracket.  Also, put a radius on the motor wheels before you start riding.

Notice that I added a teather to the rear of my skateboards.  The teather allows you to brake faster and lean forward harder prior to accelleration.  Also, if you make a mistake in your balance, the teather can be used to pull yourself back to the center of the board.  Or if you need to jump off, the teather keeps you board by your side.  Great for towing the skateboard across the street at busy intersections with high curbs.

Okay ich verstehe das Problem liegt einfach daran dass die Landwheel Batterien sich dreimal schneller entladen als normale Akku









Ich danke f√ºr den Unterricht bin sofort runter in die Werkstatt und habe begonnen aus der Ladestation ein Akku Schacht zu bauen habe mir etwas Gutes ausgedacht Plug-and-Play so dass meine S√∂hne noch jederzeit mit einem Akku fahren k√∂nnen wenn ich fahren will habe ich in 2 Minuten den zweiten Akkuschacht installiert und schlie√üe den einfach √ºber ein XT60 Stecker an und siehe da es werden sogar beide Akkus geladen wenn ich einstecke. Konnte es nicht erwarten und obwohl ich Fr√ºhschicht habe bin ich gestern Abend noch raus und habe unseren 15 % Berg in Angriff genommen der ca 500m hochgeht mit gef√ºhlvollen Gas fuhr es mit ca 20 kmh bergauf beeindruckend aber Drossel ich es im Berg auf ca 5 kmh und gebe dann Vollgas schneidet es aus aber es geht nicht komplett aus es bleibt an was es fr√ºher nicht gemacht hat und ich kann wieder Gas geben das ist der einzige Fehler den es jetzt noch hat wenn man mit Gef√ºhl Vollgas gibt hat man aber keine Probleme und kann bis Endgeschwindigkeit beschleunigen. Ich glaube ich w√ºrde doch gerne noch einen anderen ESC ausprobieren aber die Kinder lieben diesen ESC weil der so sch√∂n sanft und glatt ist. Auf jeden Fall Luzifers schon mal viel besser und so kann ich auch ab und zu mal mitfahren die Kinder kommen mit einem Akku aus.

Okay I understand the problem is simply because the Landwheel batteries discharge three times faster than normal battery

Thank you for the lesson I am immediately in the workshop and have started to build a rechargeable battery bay from the charging station I've thought something good plug and play so that my sons can still go with a battery at any time if I want to drive I have in 2 minutes installed the second battery bay and connect the easy via an XT60 connector and see there are even both batteries are charged when I plug in. Could not wait and although I have early shift I'm still out yesterday evening and have our 15% mountain tackled about 500m high with soulful gas drove it with about 20 km / h uphill impressive but I throttle it in the mountain to about 5 km / h then full throttle cuts it out but it does not work out completely it stays on what it did not do before and I can accelerate again this is the only mistake it still has when you feel full throttle but you have no problems and can to accelerate to final speed. I think I would like to try another ESC but the kids love this ESC because it's so soft and smooth. In any case, Lucifer's much better and so I can also ride from time to time the kids come out with a battery.

**English Response:**
Hi Germane:
If i understand the translaton correctly, you have built a double battery landwheel using the charging station as the second battery bay. YOu can now climb a 15 degree hill for 500M at 20kph and you are a 100KG rider.  This impresses you but soon after the Land wheel cuts out more safely.  The 100% brakes problem is gone.  After the cut out you can continue.
You are thinking of canging the ESC.

Here are my responses:
1) Great job on the dual battery Landwheel, you should post pictures of it including your wiring.
2) The performance improvment is expected.  The voltage is droping slower so the ESC has time to power down gracefully.  This solves the 100% brakes problem.
3) After the power shut down, you sould not continue.  This is how landwheel battereis get damaged.  The voltage recovers quickly but the capacity is too low.  The ESC thinks the battery is sufficient becasue of the rapid voltage recovery.  To protect the battery stop riding after the first vibration alert and most definitely after the first power down.
4) The ESC is not the problem.  The same ESC works well in many different chinese boards that use normal lithium cell batteries.  If this ESC was connected to a normal battery, the landwheel would have a much longer range, but the incredible accelleration would also disappear.
5) If you accelerate full speed up hill for 500m, on a cold day, that is probably as far as you can go.  The landwheel is for warm weather. 
6) I weigh the same as you (100KG).  My solution now is to only ride the landwheel in warm weather.  Also,I have six Landwheel batteries.  My range depends on how hard I accellerate.  and how fast.  If I ride Gentle I can travel 14km on two battereis.  If I ride hard and fast, then only 5km.  Heavy riders always have this problem.  The advantage of the landwheel is that a heavy rider can accelerate as fast as a light rider.  But that takes a lot of energy out of the battery in a short time.  So range can be very short.

Hallo Germane:
Wenn ich die Umlagerung richtig verstanden habe, haben Sie ein doppeltes Batterie-Landrad gebaut, indem Sie die Ladestation als zweites Batteriefach verwenden. Sie k√∂nnen jetzt einen 15-Grad-H√ºgel f√ºr 500 m mit 20 km / h und Sie sind ein 100 kg Fahrer. Das beeindruckt dich aber bald nachdem das Landrad sicherer ausschneidet. Das 100% Bremsen Problem ist weg. Nach dem Ausschneiden k√∂nnen Sie fortfahren.
Sie denken daran, den ESC zu verfolgen.

Hier sind meine Antworten:
1) Gute Arbeit an der Dual-Batterie Landwheel, sollten Sie Bilder davon einschlie√ülich Ihrer Verkabelung.
2) Die Leistungsverbesserung wird erwartet. Die Spannung f√§llt langsamer ab, so dass der Regler Zeit hat, sich ordnungsgem√§√ü abzuschalten. Dies l√∂st das Problem der 100% Bremsen.
3) Nachdem der Strom abgeschaltet wurde, sollten Sie nicht weitermachen. Dies ist, wie Landwheel Battereis besch√§digt werden. Die Spannung erholt sich schnell, aber die Kapazit√§t ist zu niedrig. Der ESC h√§lt die Batterie aufgrund der schnellen Spannungswiederkehr f√ºr ausreichend. Um die Batterie zu sch√ºtzen, h√∂ren Sie nach dem ersten Vibrationsalarm und ganz sicher nach dem ersten Ausschalten auf zu fahren.
4) Der ESC ist nicht das Problem. Derselbe ESC funktioniert gut in vielen verschiedenen chinesischen Boards, die normale Lithium-Batterien verwenden. Wenn diese ESC mit einer normalen Batterie verbunden w√§re, h√§tte das Landrad eine viel gr√∂√üere Reichweite, aber die unglaubliche Beschleunigung w√ºrde auch verschwinden.
5) Wenn Sie die volle Geschwindigkeit f√ºr 500m an einem kalten Tag beschleunigen, ist das wahrscheinlich so weit wie m√∂glich. Das Landrad ist f√ºr warmes Wetter.
6) Ich wiege das gleiche wie Sie (100 kg). Meine L√∂sung ist jetzt, nur bei warmem Wetter das Landrad zu fahren. Au√üerdem habe ich sechs Landwheel-Batterien. Mein Bereich h√§ngt davon ab, wie stark ich beschleunige. und wie schnell. Wenn ich Gentle fahre, kann ich 14km auf zwei Battereis fahren. Wenn ich hart und schnell fahre, dann nur 5km. Schwere Fahrer haben immer dieses Problem. Der Vorteil des Landrads ist, dass ein schwerer Fahrer so schnell wie ein leichter Fahrer beschleunigen kann. Aber das nimmt in kurzer Zeit viel Energie aus der Batterie. Daher kann die Reichweite sehr kurz sein.

Thanks for the pictures.  Now I see you have the V4, not the L3-x.  I'm surprised you can stay on when you use the brakes.  The V4 brakes were insanely strong.  Perhaps you should add the dog leash teather to the back.

I am very impressed with your mount for the spare battery. The battery is very heavy so maybe the middle screw should be bolted through to the other side of the deck.  Is your rubber band strong enough?

The L3-x brakes are much safer but a little soft for a 100KG rider.  For me the 4WD L3-x has perfect brakes.

I'm happy that the double battery V4 works out for you.

Germane:

I must warn you that the V4 Brakes become much more powerful with dual batteries. The brake force is stronger when the batteries are full. Even Stronger when braking down hill. Even Stronger braking down hill with full batteries. This scale should explain:

BoostedBoard Brake strength = 10 (perfect)
V4 Landwheel Brake Strength =  20
V4 Dual Battery Landwheel Brake Strength = 25
V4 Dual Battery LW, Down Hill, Full Battery = 50  (Very dangerous, to powerful to use)

Please be careful.

Germane:

Ich muss Sie warnen, dass die V4-Bremsen mit Doppelbatterien viel leistungsf√§higer werden. Die Bremskraft ist st√§rker, wenn die Batterien voll sind. Noch st√§rker beim Abbremsen. Selbst St√§rkeres Abbremsen mit vollen Batterien. Diese Skala sollte erkl√§ren:

BoostedBoard Bremsst√§rke = 10 (perfekt)
V4 Landwheel Bremsst√§rke = 20
V4 Dual-Batterie Landwheel Bremsst√§rke = 25
V4 Dual-Batterie LW, Down Hill, volle Batterie = 50 (sehr gef√§hrlich, zu leistungsf√§hig zu verwenden)

Just remember the brakes on a hill are completely different. At least 2x stronger when traveling down hill.

You should think about ordering L3-x PU for the motor wheels and mabey L3-x Fly Wheels for the front.  The vibration is much lower.

Yes, the black wheels look bad with wear, but its only an appearance (cosmetic).  They hold togehter very well.  They don't fall apart.  They look like they are falling apart but they actually last for a very long time.  I have never seen a broken pair.  I have 750 km on mine.

The reason for the bad appearance is that the PU is very soft for the purpose of absorbing vibration.  It works but there are many dents in the surface.

Also, you motors will not last long with the Orange PU.  It is too thin. Rocks can damage the motor.

92 mm is much safer if there are cracks in the road.  The higher center of gravity is a very small change.

My VESC settings are pretty standard: 50A/-50A motor, 45A/-10A battery "power mode" and 30A/-50A motor for "normal" mode :) I can do 10s and 12s with these values. For BLDC they should be the same, my friends use only 30A with the Maytechs you got but they're still impressive :) even in BLDC the hubs are quiet. FOC is a little bit better but BLDC is fine too. They're afraid that they'll fry the ESC with FOC.
I'll get you the XML later ;)

**Pros.**
I run over 20km with this battery pack, it seems there is no problem.

**Cons.**
The inside of the case is quite tight.
Since the capacity of the cell I used is 3500mAh, I can only run the same distance as the original battery pack.
It is not waterproof at all. :joy:

Open up the compartment below the battery and disconnect the sensor wires for the motor that is locking up.  Leave connected the sensor wire for the other motor.

Let me know if it works much better afterwards.

If it works better, you can assume that the sensor wires are damaged in one of the motors.  Disconnecting the sensor wire makes the ESC run sensorless on one side.  

You want to run the other motor with sensors becasue it will help you with low speed starts.

If this fix works, you the acelleration should be almost indistinguishable from when both motors running with working sensors.

I have not had this problem myself.  However, I recall another poster having the same problem as you.

Also, dont assume that the left sensor socket on the circuit board corresponds to the left motor.  They may actually cross over.  If you disconnect the three motor wirers on one  side, and then run the motors, you will know if they cross over or if left corresponds to left and right to right.

Once you figure that out, reconnect the three motor wires and diconnect the sensor corresponding to the damaged motor.

I'm guessing the wires i have outlined are the sensor wires? I couldn't disconnect them because they're glued together. I decided to put everything back together after disconnecting and reconnecting the motor wires and fiddling with the sensor wires. Miraculously the motor worked fine under low load once again. My guess is one of the wires is either loose or pinched. I messaged the company from which i ordered my Landwheel from in case my warranty covers it but I'm worried it doesn't.   
Yes the wires for the motors where on the opposite side. 
Thanks!

It might have been a loose motor wire.  You may have fixed the problem by reseating the motor wire connectors.  It is also possible that a bad solder joint is present in one of the motor wires.  If that is the case, the problem might return but it could be very easy to fix with some solder.

Another possibility is a broken wire in the sensor wires.  Breaks inside the insullation can connect and disconnect depending on the position of the wire.  Moving the wires around like you did can temporarily restore the continuity.

If the problem returns, and you want to try disconnecting the sensor wires, this is not difficult to do.  The yellow glue that you have circled is not hard to remove with strong plyers or wire cutters.  Just use the plyers or wire cutters to crush and tear at the glue.  Once you break the glue's seal in a small area, the entire blob of glue becomes easy to peel off with pliers.  I find wire cutters are best for crushing the glue. You can glue them back together with hot glue if you find the sensor wire is not the problem.

One other thing to look for is this.  The landwheels with the ABS shells all  suffer from broken screw posts eventually.  when this happens the metal backing plate and the ABS shell won't be held tightly together.  That can allow wires like the sensor wires to slip between the ABS shell and the backing plate.  It is one way that the wires can be damaged.

If you have replaced your ABS shell with a PVC shell, make sure you did not pinch any wires between the shell and the backing plate during re-assembly.  Pinched wires can either break or short circuit.  Both types of problems can be intermittent. So it may be worth it for you to disassemble the backing plate to inspect the condition of the screw posts.  Prior to disassembling the backing plate you need to remove the electronics cover.  During the disassembly check that the motor wires and sensor wires are not pinched between the backing plate and the ABS shell or between the backing plate and the battery terminal block.

The fact that just assembly and re-assembly has resolved the problem suggests that there is a possibility of intermittent connecetivity of a wire or intermittent shorting of wires. 

The best case for you is that reseating the motor wire bullet connectors has fixed this permanently.  However, I think this is less likely than the various intermittent scenarios that I described above.

It's worth taking the time to track down an intermittent problem.  For example, if you are traveling along at full speed and one motor wire diconnects, then having only two motor wires connected can lock the motor into a fixed position.

The way to test the motor wire bullet connectors is to gently pull each bullet connector away from the wire.  If its a bad solder connection, the connector should pull right off the wire.

I think I fixed my issue. I read somewhere that someone had issues with their phase wires shorting out with their hall sensor wires on their eboard. I decided to separate the wires and use heat shrink over the bullet connectors and put a little dab of hot glue over the hall sensor connector. So yesterday I took a 14.5 miles trip on the Landwheel and clocked 9.5 miles on a single battery with mixed riding (pushing downhill) on slow mode and did the rest with another battery in high mode and still had a flashing blue light left. I'm so happy again üòä ![KIMG0672|281x500](upload://qo06yBTlXyoaOcZhWPWzYDyr2T7.jpeg) ![KIMG0673|281x500](upload://f10ArTW24jjh5SkmcSNxfuq7gJW.jpeg) ![Screenshot_20181205-133242|281x500](upload://rpm7njzWsDjyMTjGzh5VBz45hq2.png) ![Screenshot_20181205-153546|281x500](upload://1IyFWt3rPjpJmemuPs30kvk0vIO.png)

9.5 miles on a landwheel battery is far to long.  5 - 6 miles is the practical upper limit (if you power down at the appropriat battery indicator).  As soon as you hit the third flashing blue light, its time to stop immediately.  It is possible to ride longer but it puts the battery in peril.

The landwheel battery has a rapid discharge rate which gives it the wild acceleration and hill climbing.

It also has a rapid recovery rate. 

So if you ride down to the third flashing blue light, then coast or push or just ride with a very light thumb on the throttle, the battery will recover voltage. Unfortunately, the voltage recovery is a very shallow charge. 

So if you keep repeating this riding style to squeeze the maximum distance out of a landwheel battery then you are likely to destroy the battery in a single trip.

You can‚Äôt ride a landwheel battery on the last flashing blue light. As soon as the last blue light starts flashing it‚Äôs time to power down.  Easing off on the accelerator, heading down hill or anything else you do after the third light starts flashing blue is just serving to progressively ratchet the battery down below its minimum safe charge.

I did exactly the same thing myself  a year ago -- the first time I took my first L3-x for a long range ride. I ruined the battery on that one trip.  It‚Äôs just not the way the product is supposed to be ridden.  I recall the manual does say to stop riding when the third light starts flashing.

Once a LW battery is damaged, it becomes very unsafe.  The voltage tends to drop extremely fast down to nothing.  That sudden loss of all power can trigger the wheels to lock up.  I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs an intentional emergency brake or if the circuit board just fails to cycle the power between the three motor wires.  I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the second scenario, I think below a certain voltage, the ESC gets stuck in one of the three charge positions, effectively locking one or both motors in to place.

With an undamaged battery, the ESC has time to power down gracefully.  But with a damaged battery the voltage drop is so sudden that there is no time for a graceful power down.  

For the same reasons described above, you never want to power up a landwheel that has just powerd down due to low voltage.  In the time that it takes to step off the board and turn it upside down, the landwheel battery can recover enough voltage to trick the ESC into thinking it has enough power to continue.

[/quote]

If the heat shrink on the motor wires appears to have fixed your intermittent motor lock,  then the original problem was likely a bad solder joint.  I really doubt that you had a charge jumping the huge air gap between bullet connectors.  That's very implausible.

So I supect the heat shrink is only masking a bad solder joint.  I recommend you  cut off the heat shrink and tug on the bullet connectors until you find the bad connection. If you can't find the flaw then just resolder them all.

An intermittent connection on a motor wire can cause the wheels to lock in one postion.    Safety first.  An electic skateboard is not something you want to hold together wiht bubble gum, duct tape, or heat shrink.

If your Landwheel ESC is functioning properly, you don't need an anti spark switch.  The V2's and V3's sparked when you inserted the battery.  The V4 does not spark.

Yes, after purchasing my landwheel and 4 batteries, all of them failed to work as well as the device.
I mean completely failed. even after installing a new ESC. I think I kept getting sent dodgy parts.
The owner Jason said to me Landwheel was a bust and a let down and that he was starting another e skateboard company. I was told I would get a free board once its up and running as I couldn't get any refunds.. A few months later I get no reply's etc. Had a feeling it was all a lie. Not a good sign for landwheel owners. The lesson I have learned is to spend a bit more on a US or EU board. 

As the thread says Landwheel L3-X Review, my review is to stay clear. I wasted $700 on this peice of kit and many many hours trying to fix it.

@Byronel

Visnu has a point.  There are lots of ways to fix a landwheel.  My take on the landwheel experiment is that it all came down to the batteries.  it was an unconventional choice.  The plus side of that choice was a rapid discharge rate that supported spectacular acceleration.  The downside of the choice was that the same battery also had a rapid voltage recovery rate that allowed riders to run the battery down to automated power down, then restart the landwheel and keep running.  That was contrary to the usage instructions but alot of riders including myself did just that.  I figured that out after wrecking my first two batteries doing long range tests.  I bought 6 more batteries and none of them failed with the proper usage. So the batteries could be durable, just not in the way that many riders use them.  This problem is not unique to Skateboards.  I wrecked an EGO 54 volt chainsaw battery by over depleting it in the same way that I did to the first two land wheel batteries. Now I have a half dozen Ego power tools and batteries and no additional batteries have failed becasue I use them properly.  I've seen others wreck boosted board batteries over depleting them.  It's a characteristic of many lithium batteries that running past the first power down is the kiss of death for a battery.  Landwheel batteries did have limited range so they encouraged users to mis-use them every time the rider tried to streatch out the range.

I sympathize with your experience.  Its no fun to spend a lot of money on something and end up with it being unusable.  I also sympathize with Jason who set out to make what he though was going to be the greatest electric skateboard and encountered so many more problems than he expected.  He paid a heafty price for what in my opinion all came down to a battery that was not well suited to the expected range and usage patterns of most riders.

I overcame those limitations for my self by doubling up the drives and buying enough batteries to swap my way up to 20 kilometers of range. By rigerously powering down at the last flashing blue dot, I've traveled many hundreds of kilometers with zero battery failures.

I know Jason is trying to regroup and I wish him well.  If he learned all the lessons that were to be learned from Landwheels V1 through V5, then he may ultimately suceed.

At this point, being bitter won't get your landwheel up and running.  Vishnu has one solution which is to repurpose your landwheel hubs.  They are spectacular and can be unioned with a pair of Vescs and a conventional Skateboard battery or even a Mepo replacement battery.

However, there is a simpler solution which is to replace the battery only.  It's a pretty simple task to patch a conventional skateboard battery in to any version of the Landwheel.  The result is longer range than landwheel riders are accustomed to and virtually the same acceleration curve.

Recently, I've experimented with connecting the Landwheels up to power tool batteries.  I've actually assembled two of these.  One is made with a V2.  The second is an L3-x.  you might wonder why I did this if I have six working landwheel bateries.  The answer is that I made these as air travel boards. Landwheel battereis are questionable by some airlines becasue any lithium battery that is associated with a skateboard is questionable.  Power tool batteries are accepted without question.

Both landwheel boards work when powered by power tool batteries.  Especially the V2 (which was famously unusable when it was shipped) transforms into a top notch electric skateboard.  Power batteries are super cheap.  Two in series output 41 volts.  So far my only caution is that the V2 has no brakes when the batteries are fresh off the charger.  But moments after burning off a few joules, the V2 Brakes are rock solid.

So you have lots of options to get back on the road.  There are some private forums up here where Landwheel riders collaborate around VESC settings.  I can invite you to those forums if it interests you.

When I'm done my vacation testing of my "Rigid Landwheels"  I'll post some how to pictures, Instructions and maybe a video.

Im new to electric longboard and I just got the l3X gen5 second hand. I tried to buy a battery on the web but im not getting any answer from the original seller.
 From what I read on this post, the company is dead.

[quote="Xmir, post:258, topic:45697"]

[/quote]


Easy. especially if you buy the Meepo enclosure. Then you bolt the Meepo battery and enclosure to the front of the board and the L3-x drive to the back.  Two wires to jumper the meepo battery into the L3-x drive.  Suggest you disconnect the L3-x terminal block to prevent shorts and don't make any use of any damaged L3-x batteries and don't try to combine the Meepo and Landwheel battery to run them in parallel.

I'll be posting a video in a week or so showing how I replaced Landwheel batteries with power tool batteries for the purpose of a travel e-skateboard.  It worked.  But a Meepo battery would be more suitable for daily use and group rides. Get as large a battery as possible.  The L3-x is capable of massive acceleration.  But it needs a serious battery to get the most out of it. If the battery can't keep up, it will limit things like up hill acceleration.  The L3-x ESC likes a battery with 42.5 volts fresh off the charger.  Check around to see if a 36 volt Meepo battery will give you that or if there are other batteries that are more suitable. The two 18 volt power tool batteries (wired in series)  output 40.1 volts fresh off the charger.  Its barely enough.  The L3-x thinks its dealing with an almost depleted battery so its touch and go for the start-up.  Sometimes takes 20 pushes of the power to trick the ESC into starting up. I found that the power tool batteries changed with more charge cycles.  The range capacity increased dramatically but the peak charge voltage dropped marginally.  That small drop eventually made it impossible for the L3-X ESC to successfully power-up.  No such problems with the Landwheel V2 ESC.  It was built for much lower voltage.  A Landwheel V2 is actually a formidable skateboard when powered by a larger battery than came with the V2.

Since you are seeking to restore an L3-x to full function, see if you can find a Meepo rider to tell you what the peak voltage is fresh off the charger before you go out and buy one. It has to be somewhere between 41.5 and 42.5 volts for you to expect good results.  The other option is to pick just about any battery and swap out your ESC for two Vescs.  

Be careful running the L3-x on any fully charged battery with brakes.  The L3-x battery comes off the charger under charged to support full battery braking.  If the battery has no capacity to absorb the Regen current, you can fry the L3-x Esc.  So if you swap batteries to something other than Landwheel, you need to run a few blocks without brakes before braking.  MUCH LONGER BEFORE YOU  HEAD DOWN HILL.

Hi there, thanks for the reply. I do appreciate everyone help on this thread! I am really busy with work and life currently that I have no time for myself let alone try fix my land-wheel, hence my frustration at Jason and the land-wheel team.

When I get time again I will try read up more about what solutions to look into as you are all very skilled and have a lot of knowledge as to how this all works. I think my issue is the batteries have very very poorly made connectors. On the charger if I bang on the battery is shows it want to charge but then shows fully charged even tho its dead. I have had my batteries looked at by an ebike shop and the cells are all mostly all balanced so it must be the connector or BMS. I guess the only solution is to either try using meepo parts or somehow fix the batteries connectors. 

This is going to sound really noobish  but is a VESC a ESC ? And can any BMS be used on the landwheel batteries given they are from the same maker as the VESC/ ESC?

Many thanks and also thak you @Mikenopolis and @revel_flo

From your description, your charger is behaving in a manner indicaitng the Landwheel battery is damaged.  My opinion is that this is usualy as a result of over depletion.  Typically this is from trying to squeeze too much range out of the battery or continuing to ride after a power down.  For those who still have functioning landwheel battereis, its avoidable by powering down as soon as the last blue dot starts flashing. The very first vibration alert is another good signal to power down and swap.

I'm guessing Byron, that you only have one battery and that its damaged. A different BMS is not going to help you.

So connecting a different battery from another manufacturer is one good way to resurect the Landwheel.  You just need to make sure the peak voltage off the charger is up around 42 volts.  42.5 is perfect.  40 is too low.   The landwheel ESC will check the voltage when you power it up.  If it finds less than 40.5 volts, it will shut down during the start-up cycle.  So the blue light will come on for a microsecond and then turn off. I found that with 40.1 volts I could get the L3-X to start-up if I pushed the button six to 10 times.  But Below 40.1 volts it was hopeless.

A VESC is a programmable ESC designed by benjam Vedder.  It has programmable settings including minimum and maximum battery voltage.

Hi Paul. Thanks for the reply. So I have 4 batteries. After reading this thread I never over deplete the batteries. I know you mentioned this too me before and I took your advise.
Of the 4 I have, only the one works and not 100%. Its enough to go 2 km but any more and I literally dies at any time. Of 4 batteries, 2 of them have this charging issue, one of them kinda work and the last one is a complete dud. I will try the six to 10 times button technique. 

I will get a voltage meter this week and check all the voltages on the batteries.  

Thanks for the clarification on VESC vs ESC.

So that's interesting.  You put landwheel hub motors on the front and belt drive motors on the back.  Which power tool bateries did you use?  What are the specifications for  volts, amp hours, watt hours?  What does the volt meter say fresh off the charger with the two bateries in series?  YOu may have noticed from my video that I did something similar with 18 volt rigid batteries.  The peak voltage started off at 40.1 volts which was just barely enough to start up the L3-x.  Eventually the peak voltage was lower (after a number of charge cycles) and the L3-x would not power up any more.  I'm curious what your battereis add up to.  What's your range?  Why did you choose a hub/belt drive combination?

Requiring 10 button pushes to start up was an observation, not a solution.  Two power tool batteries in series output 40.1 volts which was barely enough to start-up an L3-x.  After a number of charge cycles, the peak charge voltage dropped just marginally and the L3-x would blink and then shut down during the powe-up cycle.  Extrapolating from that experiment, you need to choose a replacement battery that has the right voltage range or you need to switch to a vesc.  

Also, don't run the L3-x on damaged batteries.  They have no capacity to absorb the Regen current so you can blow the ESC during braking.

The rear systems actually setup on two Vanda vesc and I haven't had a chance to plug those in either because my computer is not capable of it so I have to get a new computer then I'll have more accurate readings of what my board is doing but current setup it's running great lots of speed if my motor is in the rear didn't blow the other day in San Diego I'm guessing I'd still be hitting about 32 miles per hour. I went with Milwaukee because they have the longest amp hour range at five point 0

@Byronel buy some Milwaukee's drills with the 5.0 red Lithium, Wire it up in series, You can't go wrong. Milwaukee offers warranty on the battery. Anyway get some vesc's if you can Fully customizable they are. You can use whatever power tool battery you really want cuz I really like the look of Milwaukee's and they're strong and pretty waterproof. also I don't know if any of the other companies for power tools are putting the redlithium 5.0s which give me the max range

Battery 1 has the correct peak voltage.  If it is in good condition otherwise, the range can vary between 2 km and 4.5 km.  Each time you ride beyond the range limit, cells can be damaged.  Temperature, weight and how hard you accellerate or ride up hill all reduce the range on each trip. The first vibration alert indicates time to power down.  If you stop at the first vibration alert and go through a charge cycle, you can gradually build up the range of most lithium batteries including the Landwheel batteries.  


Batteies 2,3,4 likely  do not have enough peak voltage to power up the landwheel. If they do, thye won't go very far.  Maybey only a few feet. Most likely one cell is damaged in each battery. Thats my guess.  Some have restored batteries like these by disassembling them and equalizing the batteries with a single cell charger.  From what I understand one cell is usually damaged beyond restoration. I have no experience with either method that  myself.  Working with lithium battery cells can be dangerous.

If you live near california, you might want to team up with @ShutterShock   He is looking for dead landwheel batteries and he has the skill to swap good cells for bad cells.  He may be able to caniblaize one of your three bad batteries to repair his own battery and maybey two of yours.

Others have gutted the Landwheel batteries and replaced the cells with tesla style cells.  But the example that I saw left no room inside the battery for a BMS so they taped the BMS to the exterior of the battery.

Other than working with @ShutterShock, your best option likely involves connecting the Landwheel to a third party battery.  Just make sure the peak voltage off the charger is in the right range.  42.5 is perfect.  41 volts might be enough as long as the peak volts don't drop too much over time.

It may be possible to order the guts of the battery for landwheel ownsers who would like to remove the guts of thier landwheel battery and swap in a replacement core.

This is the manufacturer:

I don't have the time to persue this myself.  @revel_flo It might be easiest for you  to work with Jason or directly wiht the core manufacturer to see if there is  possibility of a bulk purchase of landwheel battery cores. 

Your thoughts?

This might help to identify the specific battery to the manufacturer.

Thank you very much Paul, appreciate it. Unfortunately I am in London. Will try figure out either how to do it or find someone who can.

I am a 3D designer and I have wondered about giving the land-wheel battery a little bit more height in the centre (think where the logo is), This would allow for Tesla batteries and a BMS inside one housing. Does anyone here on this thread have access to a 3D scanner? I could redesign the housing and share the 3D printing file if they could send me the 3D scanned file.

It means the BMS has detected a bad cell and for safety reasons will not accept a charge from the charging brick.  Green does not mean the battery is good.  It means the charging cycle is over because the BMS is not drawing power from the brick.

I believe that the 25 volt V2 batteries wer 3200 MAH.  The very first V3 & V4 36 volt batteries that came out were mis labeled as 3200MAH becasue the battery sticker from the old product was used.  In fact all  of the 36 volt batteries were 4200MAH.

Just a word of warning, these land-wheels are dangerous. I was on a road, a very smooth road, going at around 22mph until the land-wheel snapped.

wow, that axle snapped clean off! I'm surprised it did that with the smoother roads you ride on. Sadly this kind of breakage is not new as its happened to many brands of trucks. Raptor 2 just had ANOTHER one snap recently. I wonder if the torque weakens them over time with the twisting motion.

Before you throw the whole thing away, I believe @KaramQ is in need of a battery

So, that's a thing that can happen to any hub drive electric skateboard.  

I see Mike had the same thing to say and beat me by 1 minute.

I've too  have seen people post about the same type of failure happening to raptors and carvons.  I've only seen one other complaint about a landwheel motor sheering off from the trucks.  There may be more than I know of. But the one I saw previoulsy was a V3 and it looked really beat-up.

For what it's worth, I've always been terrified of loosing a wheel at speed so i've engineered my set-up so that I never need to worry about it.  8 wheels!!!

This adds som weight but it also adds tremendous safety.  The double trucks float cleanly over large cracks in the pavement.  With single trucks, getting caught in those cracks puts eormous stress on the axles and also present the risk of throwing the rider off the front if the wheels get completely locked in to a crack.  I use to hate the whalopping sound of a set of wheels dipping deep into a crack in the road.  Its a frightening sound.  Roads in Ottawa Canada are just horrible.  So this set-up fixed it all for me.

![image|690x382](upload://thlnEyk5g8fHzVsW0e1Eps2b7zG.jpeg) 

And like Mike said, check who wants spare parts before you toss your landwheel.  Mabey someone wants an ESC, remote, your other hub motore, etc.  I know @Vishnu was looking for motors.

Back to the topic of repacing the Landwheel battery with a different battery...I happened across an informative video form Mboards:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pouyqky2pF8

Mboards sells battereis:

https://www.mboards.co/collections/batteries

This is the biggest one:
https://www.mboards.co/collections/batteries/products/12s4p-complete-battery-solution

but its 44 nominal volts which could be a 52 volts or higher of peak voltage.  So that's probably too much for a landwheel ESC.

Here is the 36 volt version:

https://www.mboards.co/collections/batteries/products/10s4p-complete-battery-solution

It might be worth using the seller's contact link to find out what the peak charge voltage is.  42.5 is ideal.  40 volts is too low.

Thier batteries include a BMS inside the battery enclosure plus a charging brick.

If you are going to get pre-built batteries, but not custom packs, I would suggest asking @Jlabs /BuildKitBoards though he's out of stock at the moment. or just go with @torqueboards / https:///collections/electric-skateboard-battery-pack These are still mostly Chinese made packs but you are dealing with someone who know the specs and product they sell and will have after sale support. They don't sell you anything that is not in stock (unless it's listed as a presale or group buy)

I ran the battery in series inside the mounts. I took the mount from the drill itself
[/quote]

So I checked out my the L3-x that I had set-up as a travel board.  I thought it stopped working as a result of lower voltage from the drill batteries after several charge cycles.  It turns out my ESC won't start up even wiht a fresh L3-x battery.  My conclusion is that I likely damaged the ESC by using the drill battteries.  The most likely cause would be that the regenerative braking current had no where to go either becasue the batteries were full or because a circuit breaker internal to the drill batteries cut off the current to protect the batteries.  

The V2 Landwheel does not have the same problem yet.  I'm not sure if a VESC might have similar problems with full or overload protected batteries. 

Anyway, my conclusion from the drill battery experiment is that the most likely outcome is not a durable electric skateboard.

Yes, the two Rigid batteries in series output 41.1 volts.  But the L3-x was hard to start-up on the rigid batteries and was easy to start-up on the L3-x battery.  So when the L3-x eventually completely failed to start-up  in the dominican republic resort, I assumed the peak voltage was dropping.  That was a guess becasue I did not have a volt meter with me.  Now that I'm back home, the L3-x will not start up at all on the original L3-x battery.   The same battery easily starts up a different L3-x drive. Also, the volt meter still shows 41.1 volts from the pair of fully charged Rigid batteries.

So I believe The ESC is damaged.  It could be something else.  There might be a problem with the power button or power button cable.  It could also be a delayed reaction to the polarity reversal that occured when I built the battery from 9 volt batteries.  

![image|537x400](upload://8Nn5X3E55pNPDpbqWaDX1YEEcNG.jpeg) 

The L3-x battery has the red and black wired reversed where they connect to the battery terminals.  So I did have the 9 volt travel battery connected wiht reverse polarity for a minute.  I rode for about 40 - 50 kilometers in the dominican republic before the L3-x would not start-up any more.

I suppose the longer yours works on power tool batteries, the less likely it is that the batteries dammaged my L3-x ESC.

Full battery braking has been known to damage the L3-x ESC.  It happens when riders use V4 batteries.  V4 batteries come off the charger fully charged.  L3-x batteries come off the charger under charged.

Keep me posted on how long your L3-x  continues to work on power tool batteries.  I'm curious.  Next week, I'll try swapping parts around to see if its the entire ESC that is damaged or maybey just the power button or cable.

Hi Guys. I have a landwheel battery design that I modified. The top of the battery shell is now 25mm taller and the square area by the landwheel logo is another 25mm higher to house a BMS above normal Samsung cells. 

Please let me know if you are interested an I can send over the file for use in a 3D printer. You would just need to print the top and use slightly longer screws. Also, I can create a version with even more space if needed. 

It would be good to test it out and see if it works.

[quote="Mikenopolis, post:348, topic:45697"]
why
[/quote]
Naturally, I recognize that 6 wheel drive looks a bit extreme at first glance.
However, I had lots of good reasons for doing this.  

I'm a big guy.  I enjoy an extra-long board that gives me a wide stance.  The roads in Ottawa are really horrible.  Every street has dozens of potentially catastrophic wheel grabbing cracks and pot holes.  Last year I found that the double trucks on each end made it possible for the board to safely float over those dangerous obstacles.  The double truck also cut road vibration down to almost nothing.  That numb feeling that a lot of riders feel after riding over dimpled pavement was eliminated.  Last year, this was a four wheel drive board.  In that form, there were so many improvements in the areas of traction, high speed steering, uphill performance, improved range, braking and acceleration.

One shortcoming last year was still range.   I had a hard time matching the range of other riders in my riding group even if I traveled with extra batteries. The landwheel batteries take a long time to recharge so I could not pick up much of a charge during 20 minute pit stops where other riders could pick up a full charge. My wife‚Äôs E-bike has a 70 km range.  So riding with her, my range was also a limitation. 
Over the winter, I experimented with different batteries.  Those experiments gave me longer range but I it made the L3-X ESC relatively slow.  The top speed and acceleration were both cut in half.  One of my ESC's also stopped functioning as a result of the experiments.

The 4 wheel drive configuration that I had last year lacked balancing wires for the batteries so the batteries were always discharging unevenly.  That was reducing my range and putting my batteries at risk of over depletion.

So this year I decided to put 4 batteries on the board with balancing wires.  I felt it was preferable to carry the extra batteries on the board instead of on my back.  Now, with four batteries in parallel, I‚Äôm expecting 20 to 30 kilometers of range without having to swap batteries.  I won‚Äôt need to fill a pack sack with spare batteries or chargers and a power bar.

Originally, I was going to assemble eight wheel drive.  However, I decided to stop at 6 wheel drive for three reasons:

1) The effort to lengthen all of the wires and run them through the board took days for the first top-mounted landwheel enclosure. It took 22 solder joints total.
2) I wanted a big headlight on the front.  That required a voltage splitter and voltage regulator.  Omitting the ESC on the front of the board was the best way to make room for those electronics.
3) The drive wheels don't steer as sharp as the conventional trucks.  So I was worried about losing too much steering radius if both front trucks were motorized.

The results are pretty cool.  I've lost 30 pounds since last year, so I'm down to 205 pounds.  But I'm still a heavy rider. I know you are a heavy rider also Mike, so I think you should be aware that guy‚Äôs like us have a hard time stopping fast in an emergency and we can also loose traction in those situations.  


With 6 wheel drive, the acceleration, braking, traction and high speed steering are just so far beyond what is possible from any 2WD board out there.  Having had the unpleasant experience of being thrown from a boosted board with a loss of rear wheel traction, I really appreciate the traction advantages of what I have now.  The reduced vibration is something that really benefits my joints because my knees and ankles are not in great shape.

I really enjoy electric long boarding, but I‚Äôm over 55 years old now.  This set-up has made the board much safer for my road conditions, weight, etc.

The lighting is also a huge advantage.  I can see 50 feet ahead of me and the entire width of the road.

I have got to say the amount of effort you guys are putting into this really beggars belief.  
I was an early user of the drive system but hopped off the bandwagon when the issues just got too much to deal with.
@pkasanda  your level of commitment to a very flawed system is truly awe inspiring and the level of help you furnish other users with is again commendable but I have to say that if the effort was directed elsewhere then you could be rolling a fully tricked out lacroix by now.   Not knocking anyone here because the interesting designs are very entertaining.  Keep up the good work.

Well, I bought six  V2 Landwheels.  Jason replaced two of them wiht V4's and then sent me six L3 -x replacements.  So I have a bit of inventory to play with.

I have two boosted boards and two one wheels.  I ride them all.  But my favortie long distance board is the multi drive landwheel.  It is by far the fastest electric longboard in Ottawa.  People who have ridden lacrox boards in Montreal, tell me that the lacroix would not keep pace with my Landwheel.  thats when it was a 4WD.

My Landwheel V2 with Rigid batteries was also pretty impressive as a light weight travel board.  Huge range, strong acceleration, light weight.  The board was too short to establish top speed but it was probably 50 kph.

I've raced against Raptors  and mellow boards also.  They  were both slower -- though the mellow board surprised me to the extent it kept up.  There was a much lighter rider on the Mellow board -- but even still it was impresssive that he kept it a close race.

I was actually talking about the diy aspect of a lacroix not the pre-built.  I just wonder what innovations you could have come up had you started with a better system.  I actually got 46kmh from my standard landwheel and much better results up hill in fwd format and loved it for an everyday ride but the limitations eventually outweighed the good.  My son has never forgiven me for selling it though because it was his favourite board.  Hes 11 and weighs nothing so had none of the inherent battery issues I experienced and the smooth curves on acceleration and braking made him feel much more secure than on the meepo I replaced it with.  Now start on the raptor 2 and see what you can come up with.  Skies the limit.

I've been here since the beginning my friend.  And in the closed group but since I don't have one anymore there wasn't anything to contribute.  It is a good read though so I pop back from time to time.  I'm actually glad you took over the brand because it had such potential. (I presume you are a revel rep/owner?) As I said it was my favourite pre-built for a while because with an even number of batteries in your back pack there was absolutely no range anxiety.  If took 2 to get there make sure you have 2 to get back and its a fast, smooth little drive.  Good luck with the endeavour and I will keep checking back in.

One other thing the bloody remote ruined all other remotes for me.  Such a nice unit.  Maytech saved me though.  Same form factor and nearly as much travel.

FYI, 6 wheel drive seems to be a bad idea.  The new (Fresh out of the box) drive that I added to the rear stopped working within a week. Lots of possible reasons why.  I extended  all of the wires in order to top mount the ESC and battery.  The new wire lengths were not identical.  Its also possible that the rear most drive slips and sticks becasue it has less traction than the two drives in the center.  So I've decided to go back to 4WD but keep the 4 batteries.  The brakes were better modulated with 4WD than with 6WD. So an interesting experiment but 4WD wins.

So i figured out why my third drive stopped working.  One of the 22 soldering joints that I made to lengthen the wires broke,

![image|640x475](upload://8VMaySTTUGnl2ZMVj7cwgDMk8WT.jpeg) 

So that translates into aproximately 60% brakes.  So I guess the cool thing about three drives is that if one of them goes into lock up mode, the other two drives have the combined power to keep traveling at 50 kph.

It will be interesting to see if I have damaged the ESC or if it will be all fine after I fix the solder joint.

Hubs yes (they are very fast which is super fun and the torque kills other hubs too :slight_smile: ) but the trucks I disagree with. The hubs get too hot for them and they are just not strong enough (case and point, mine snapped clean off).
 
They would be good with less powerful motors or better trucks.

As a lifelong skater, I do also prefer smaller wheels like the backfire and mellow drive (80mm), makes the board feel more like a skateboard and less like something else hence my question about using different hubs or even belt drives with the land-wheel. 

Side note, with enertion and carvon, The same sort of issue is at play; hubs too strong for the axels. I do however think they have stronger trucks than the landwheel so my feeling is; use the landwheel at reduced speeds or use a different setup.

Landwheel friends,

We have some exciting news to share. After more than a year of product development, we are super excited to launch the next version of the product.

Meet the Revel Kit! 

![DSC00672|690x459](upload://t9WZyr3V6QZw7gvQU1JUKbyi3ij.jpeg) 

We kept what was awesome about the Landwheel V5 - the ability to mount it on most decks - and expanded the versatility of the product to now include a variety of standard longboard wheels.

![compat|680x357](upload://k2DvC5yjsayKbBAi3hcCOdDKd8w.jpeg) 

The enclosure has been completely redesigned and attaches to the baseplate, securely, with copper nuts inside each mounting screw hole. The battery has been redesigned as well, now using a slide-in system instead of the click-in system from the old version. Moved away from LIPO to high-quality LI-ION Samsung cells.

I have been riding the final prototype for the past month or so and overall, I can tell you this Kit has more torque, better brakes, higher top speed and better range. 

This is my favorite setup currently: Never Summer El Jefe + ABEC 11 Flywheels 97mm

![DSC00659|500x500](upload://eoURIcSYTg8BDGmIPuTE0KYLayG.jpeg) 

We are close to mass production but need to raise additional money so we can proceed with manufacturing without needing to sacrifice anything. 

**We will be launching a Kickstarter campaign on June 4th** (tentative date!) and it would mean the world to us to have your support once again.

You will be getting first dibs at the Early Bird price of $499!

I know many of you already ride awesome boards and perhaps don't want to deal with angry wives or girlfriends about our esk8 hoarding habits :rofl:, but please consider sharing this news with friends who might be interested in joining you on the endless ride :+1:

Best,
Flo

This new board looks amazing! I would be lying if I said my fingers were not itching wanting to hit that "Back this project" button. I probably should not though (still waiting on parts for my landwheel) looks like a solid product though. I might take the plunge for 530 (w/ samsung battery) will try to justify it for sure hehe... 10 backers in 14h means 100 won't take long. 

The one question that might push me over the edge one way or another is this. My Landwheel often buzzes at me going up hill on anything but eco mode. Is it better at keeping high power for sustained time? (perhaps an ESC cooling solution?) in general, how is torque compared to landwheel v5?

[quote="BearBoi, post:381, topic:45697"]
My Landwheel often buzzes at me going up hill on anything but eco mode.
[/quote]

I think the particular Landwheel that I ride allows me to field your question.  The Landwheel's LIPO batteries have a rapid discharge rate that allows them to accelerate up hill like its flat ground.  However, that dischsrge characteristic also allows the voltage to drop rapidly.  Landwheel batteries are also a tad low on total capacity (115 WH). When accelerating up hill with just one Landwheel battery, its not too long before the ESC detects the low voltage and the remote buzzes.

Most of you know that I build a double battery 4WD landwheel.  Even on 50% battery indicator, it can climb a 25% slope for more than a minute on full throttle.  I'm not making that up.  Its parlaiment hill in Ottawa.

More recently, I've added two extra landwheel batteries to my 4WD for a total of 4 batteries. If I ride between 20 and 30 kph the range is about 20 kilometers on 4 fully charged batteries.  But if I travel at the 49 kph that its capable of, my range drops to less than 8 kilometers.  Neither of those are great ranges considering I've quadrupled the battery capacity.

This is all to say that the low battery warnings you are getting are not as a result of heat or faulty ESC.  It all has to do with a battery choice that gave the landwheel relativley short range, particularly under hard acceleration.  Landwheel batteries can have particularly bad capacity if the rider over depletes the battery by riding on the red dot.  Red means stop.

I gave Jason suggestions based on my own battery observations.  I know many other riders echoed those recommendations.  The concensus was that the landwheel deserved a large capacity Lithium Cell battery instead of the smaller LIPO batteries.  

We  see that these suggestions were acted on with the Revel KIT.  The smallest battery is 159WH.  The Largest is 216WH.  The manufacturer is Samsung.  These are widely used battery packs that are yielding 15 - 20 mile range for other brands.

I have not had any riding  experience on the new Revel Kit.  But on paper, the battery choice addresses one of the main weaknesses of the landwheel. 

I'm really looking forward to the Revel Kit becasue I'd love to have everything that I have with my current set-up without having to lug around four to eight batteries.  I'm also looking forward to the option to mount massive 100mm plus wheels.

So I jumped in with both feet today and pledged for a double KIT with two 216 WH batteries.

Good Luck Jason.  Good Luck Flo.

Hi all, I have been in Germany the last few months and was unfortunately not able to bring my landwheel kits with me. I have been a big fan of the landwheel drive system and it seems like the Revel is nothing but a pure upgrade in every way, addressing all of the shortcomings of the previous drive system. I am seriously considering getting one of the revel kits but I have one question: are we able to get both the standard range and extended range batteries straight from the kickstarter? I see that it says something about it in the FAQ of the kickstarter page but I can‚Äôt see it. Not sure if this is because i am on the mobile version of the site and the formatting may be different.

I posted the below on a different forum but might be good context for anyone curious to learn more:

> 3. We‚Äôve got a lot of ‚Äòtoo good to be true‚Äô type comments (Ha!) Short term, this meant people who did not know us (Landwheel or Revel) thought it might be a sham. Long term, this is actually great news, as it means we managed to pack enough value to make this product a success once it‚Äôs out there!

I can not wait to test one of the new drives.  I am still convinced of this drive.  have 5 drives that all work and are supported by jucker Hawai with parts that are very pleased with my projects.  the new drive interests me very much and I keep my fingers crossed for you.  in Germany there are mellow boards but too expensive with 3 children who drive a lot![20190610_115239|281x500](upload://4EoXd6JF8Vcn6T3qhefz6JmKgNf.jpeg)

Check out the axle shaft square part, its a weak spot in the construction and tends to break off. In the end it might lead to something @BearBoi experienced so as long as this part is still connected you sould try to fix it to the axle (real weld, JB weld epoxy glue)

^^ I second this. I heard a clicking noise every time I would accelerate. I think because my motor mount (square bit on the end of the axle) was loose it would shake and vibrate and make this noise. It stopped once I got up to speed. It eventually snapped off completely and ate up my motor wires. Might not be the same noise you are experiencing but I would still look into this.

no I mean the game inside the engine in the camps (achsial) of the four knows stuck because I basically when the drives arrive at me the wheel nut and square with Loctite  and then put together again there is no game.  The motors have about 500 km behind and work well I think one or two magnets are loose I just do not know if I should open the can because the screws only with strong punctiform heat dissolve (blue little flame) the noise (light rattle  ) does not get louder.  Paul sorry the one has only 2 batteries 4 wheel drive I have tried and have connected the remote with the sliders together and put together in a plastic box worked great but the board was too unwieldy and heavy but very strong.  I also advise everyone to swap the base plate with kingpin turned in to make the steering a lot more precise it also works with a strip of coladose sheet metal with loctide and the screw is stuck.  the everyday usability is in the foreground with me I've secured all connections to a block or break minimize. The v4 esc with two good batteries is incredibly strong even stronger than the 10s5P battery I've tried I think that's because of the poor quality cells  ,  20sec accelerate works after that he turns off but I have in the feeling.  Range is of course bad but for something I have other boards.  My next project is a custom board from Jucker Hawai where I try to make everything transparent so that you can see the electronic assemblies best with the new drive. Paul: Your 4 (6) 8 wheel drive is certainly very safe and safety goes for![Screenshot_2018-12-01-09-27-44~2|418x500](upload://iJ42O7SqMZaOy0BiSwpNWBerQH4.jpeg)

Sorry for the german @others 
Hi @Germane, guck mal auf der Achsenseite auf den Kugellager-Bereich und dreh das Rad bis das klicken kommt, springt das gef√ºhlt ein bisschen zur√ºck? Das Problem mit dem viereckigen Schaft ist nicht ohne, ich w√ºrde an deiner Stelle nochmal schauen ob du den betroffenen Motor trotz Loctite abbekommst und mal danach gucken. Der Riss ist soweit ich das bisher mitbekommen habe nicht unbedingt gerade, daher h√§lt es bei Gegendruck durch die Schraube die den Motor auf der Achse h√§lt eine Zeitlang und f√ºhrt dann zu dem klicken. ich glaube wenn du lose Magneten h√§ttest w√§re das Ger√§usch weiter pr√§senter.

Today I had yet another breakdown with my landwheel :( last time my motor mount broke loose and ate up my cables, also in the process it fried my hall sensor and made pretty sparks fly and threw me off the board (thankfully no injury just a sore knee) not fun though. Got that sorted, got a replacement truck from @visnu777 and a new good motor from Revel, aswell as a tool for the lug nut inside the motor. I have been riding now for a week with mostly no issues, I have had a blast, until now...

This time it's an electrical failure. Yesterday going home from work the motors were "jerking" and did not keep continous power. then it did turn itself off and lost connection completely including breaks. I then assumed it was because a connector got loose because after going down a curb I noticed the case popped loose a bit. I tightened the screws, made sure all connectors were well (I had tools with me) I rode all the way home with no more issues. The screw holes on the back plate are stripped though :/ 3  of the screws don't screw in at all.

Fast forward to today, I took it out for a quick ride to the grocery store on smooth asphalt. I got about 200 meters before it lost connection again like yesterday. This time I knew the case was intact and no cables were pulled. This time the power button does nothing, not even a flash of blue light.
Kicked it back home and opened it up.

I unscrewed everything so I can see if any cables were visibly damaged or pinched, no capacitors blown, everything looked fine. I tightened the connectors a bit more and plugged in a battery to see if there was any sign of life... Saw continuous large sparks from the battery terminals before even pressing the power button, so I quickly pulled out the battery. After further examination I notice little burn marks on almost all the the battery terminal prongs.

![IMG_20190615_121258|120x180](upload://nuUb6tCpVzzPuoRo4MmEznbz52.jpeg) ![IMG_20190615_121307|120x180](upload://cWldRx0vHvCKjWSC4s3GS6MQToO.jpeg) 

At this point I think my Landwheel is done. I don't have the tools or knowledge to further analyze and figure out what works or does not. Could be the battery terminal, or the esc, or the wires, or all of the above, and I don't know how to start debugging. What I have posted on esk8 are only the major problems, the times I haven't been able to fix it myself. I also have various cracks in my frame, stripped  and cracked screw holes I have patched up my landwheel with glue more than once. This (thing) had plastic that broke which I replaced with a strong adhesive pad underneath. My antenna cable kept getting stuck in little cracks and I worried it would get damaged and I was told it is sensitive. So I glued it to the metal frame.

![IMG_20190615_121416|120x180](upload://adIwrusKlXmxuioPB80xbxJiuY3.jpeg) ![IMG_20190615_121900|120x180](upload://uQUTwrUl8U7yEA1Ixm9w4Yk8hB6.jpeg) 

I have a cracked hall sensor, which does not work, I've been fine without it though as one working hall sensor is enough as long as I'm on flat ground.

I live on top of a large, long hill, fairly steep at times too. All the way from the inner city to my apartment is about 5 miles of mostly going uphill. That is tough for any electrical skateboard, especially for a landwheel built for rapid acceleration. I've always made it work though using eco mode or just being gentle on the throttle, I'm a light rider so it works. My batteries are all getting worse and worse though and after getting my board assembled again after a month of sitting, only one of the batteries manages to get me home and past all hills without turning off. One of the batteries shut off just from being idle. The other two work great for city use and going down hills, can't get me home though. I have 4 batteries. Only one I would say works really good, two of them decent, one seems unusable after being unused for a month (I did make sure to charge it inbetween, but still made a difference)


 ![IMG_20190615_130609%20(1)|250x180](upload://6JPV5RT606n3ACi3CjhE8sjH7Dt.jpeg)  

Despite all this I check my emails daily hoping for an update on the revel kit. Why? it promises to fix most if not all the problems I have had with my landwheel. Larger capacity batteries should mean they last me longer and are more reliable. The carbon frame means I shouldn't have to worry about cracked plastic. Going away from hub motors means not all stress is directly transfered from the wheels to the motors and to the trucks, it's more spread out. I have hope that Revel and Jason will provide a great product with great customer care which is why I'm looking forward to spending $799 for a new kit.

The Landwheel has been my main form of transportation for a couple of months now. I have put maybe  around 700 miles on the board myself. I am not the first owner hoewer, I got it for around $500 used. At that point it had no signs of breaking, all the cracks and broken components are from me, so I have no one else to blame.

Still figuring out what to do with the landwheel parts and how to move forward, I might buy another board while waiting for the revel kit, or parts to make one, or find a way to repair the Landwheel, or just bite down and wait patiently for the Revel kit and be without an esk8 for the next couple of months.

@revel_flo & Jason please make revel kit badass and reliable, and thanks for your great support and communication with the community.

@BearBoi

I invited to a forum that might interest you.

Here is a second related forum:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/landwheel-hall-sensor-wiring-for-vesc/51323/4

Based on your descriptions, I'd say your ESC is fried.  This may have happened for one of four different reasons:

Damanged motors can fry an ESC
Bad batereis lack the capacity to absorb  regen current  so the ESC can be damaged braking or down hill.
Long downhill streaches on a full battery or damaged battery can do the same thing.
Brief loss of connection wiht the battery also gives the Regen current no where to go.

So if you have good motors, then a VESC conversion is your best option.  The links I gave  you have all the info you need.  Just don't use your landwheel batteries.  The discharge rate may be to high for a VESC.

If the Vesc conversion does not interest you then think about a used boosted board.  The V1's are pretty cheap.  Just check the serial number with BB to make sure its not stolen.

I have two flipsky vescs at home already. Thanks for the invite. Will be reading through that post after work. My biggest question is what battery I can/should get. I think I can get that answered from the thread you invited me to though :) if I can get my board up to working order for less than 300 USD, I'd be satisfied.

I suspect a bad battery is what caused the damage. I was using my battery that is in worst condition when the damage happened :/ one that frequently has issues. I used it because I thought it might get better after a few charge cycles, that was dumb.

I don't know what battery to recommend for a VESC.  There are lots out there.  I Just recommend against the Landwheel batteries.  They are very specific to the landwheel ESC.  But the Forum that I invited you to has examples of sucessful VESC conversions  Ask the posters which batteries they used if its not already part of their post.

So Yes.  A landwheel battery that won't take a full charge should not be used becasue it does not have enough capacity to absorb regen current.  Wiht no where to go the regen current is likely to fry the ESC.

I woudl not throw them out just yet.  One landwheel owner has created a 3D printing file for printing a deeper landwheel battery enclosure.  I think as his project moves forward, we'll see some designs for  soldering together banks of lithium ion cells and a BMS.  If you ever want to follow those instructions, you are going to need the terminal block form the old landwheel battery.

Talk to @Byronel if you want to be invited to his deeper 3D battery case thread

Landwheel x3 .Hey Paul I wanted to post a few pictures 1. to the slight click noise it's just the bearings I've disassembled a motor and I noticed that there are slight tolerances in the production also the slight squeezing of the engine  but not bad, everything is well greased and runs free objection.  When changing the bushings, you must be careful that you do not pull too strong on the motor cable sensor and thereby hurt.  you are right that the 4 wheel drive is incredibly strong and so far unbeaten my son with 50kg drove against a diyeboard with monster engines 52v ca.1500 ‚Ç¨ board and it had no chance in acceleration.  I have connected the balance cable between the drives and installed a charging socket whereby I can charge both batteries.  i have limited my charger to 41, 8v with diodes so i do not have any problems because i live on a mountain.  Regular control over the regular charger is a must for the BMS to readjust.  All my 5Batteries work well 1 v4 Battery which I drive only in v4.  a friend with whom I pass these passion parts we tours where I take a 5amp charger with me.  This sport fills me up a lot and I'm a skilled motorcycle mechanic and Esk8 is a nice replacement because I gave up the hobby of my family after 3 serious motorcycle accidents (long distance cup).  plus some pictures and my costum board![190704_073527_COLLAGE-1|400x500](upload://jxDeD3JxuFbFohtcJ0UaPJBhCBp.jpeg)![20190621_202912|281x500](upload://kgrZWvnR0Ey6RZgTd932d2MPGkw.jpeg) ![20190703_162720|690x388](upload://hsEHAVeONq8dVEg4dJKuNrWZcgq.jpeg)![IMG_0879(1)~3|351x500](upload://4TKIfjav4ckshgJiCOHwIvrWDRL.jpeg) the next project the hollow deck needs a lot of parts in clear for the next time .....enjoy your ride

So I know you are all going to be insanely jealous but I convinced Jason to send me one of his prototype Revel Kits.  Would you believe that a single revel Kit accellerates faster than a 4WD landwheel.  Its true. 

![image|405x500](upload://PAQyaMg7vcZ95m1yZVF5pkgpbR.jpeg) 

O my gosh its strong at acceleration and  fast. Smooth acceleration and smooth braking but fast.  It‚Äôs actually stronger at accelerating than my 4WD quadruple battery Landwheel L3-x.  My 4WD landwheel is the fastest skateboard in Ottawa by far.  It leaves Evolve GT‚Äôs behind like they are standing still.  The revel Kit is significantly faster.

Zero to 20 mph in 13 seconds.  I had it up to much higher speeds but forgot to save the ‚Äúmap My Ride Workout‚Äù.  I‚Äôm guessing I hit 42 KPH before I had to let off.  The pivot bushings need to be tightened and I‚Äôll swap them out for top quality pivot bushings before I try to hit top speed.  I can already tell its going to be above 50 kph. 

I compared it to a 2WD landwheel.  The revel kit accelerates so much faster. And the brakes on the revel kit are so much better than the L3-x brakes (which were pretty darn good brakes).

I like the Revel kit brakes better than my 4WD brakes.  The brakes are so effective its hard to describe.

My daughter took some video and drone footage.  I'll post it after she edits it.

So I leared a few new things about the Revel Kit.  The front Trucks are new and about a half inch wider than the L3-x Front trucks.  I did not notice that at first.  So I was using an L3-x front truck becasue I assumed ther was no difference.  With the L3-x trucks, I had a speed wobble even after tightening the pivot bushings and also upgrading to bones bushings.  After swapping the Revel Kit front Truck on to the board, the speed woble is gone.  I'm pretty sure I hit top speed with the proper trucks.  It seemed faster than 50 kph but I did not have my cell phone with me to measure top speed.  Tommorrow, I'll go for a long  ride to evaluate range.

51.1 kph (or faster)

So I went for a long ride with my ottawa riding group. I have the 216 WH battery.

I was able to travel 17.5 kilometers on a single charge.  However, I was riding pretty fast (above 30 kph for most of the ride and the route was mostly up hill. I gained 50 feet in elevation. The last three kilometers i was riding on a solid red dot with flickers of blue.  I switched to economy mode and streached out the ride to get the next charging station.  So 17.5 KPH was an absolute maximum for my weight (206 Lbs) and the route that we took.  If I rode any further, I would have been on flashing red.  I wish I would have had a spare battery to swap in.

I then recarged over lunch.  Charging was very convenient becasue the Revel Kit has a charging port built in.  only had to carry the charging brick with me. The charge time is a little long but it seemed on par with the other boards.  ONe rider wiht a boosted board mini extended range was able to get his batery up to 92%.  I think we charged for over an hour. My charger did not switch from red to green but I was able to get up to a full charge indicator on the remote.  So I was probably also at 92%.   If I had the newer version of the remote I would have had acces to battery statistics. 

We got back on the bike paths and rode for another 15 minutes.  I dropped down one blue dot which confirmed my charge was less than 100%. 

At that point,I had a drag race with the whole riding group including a modified Evolve GT.  The GT rider had upgraded from the stock 100 KV motors to 200 KV motors.  This evolve GT was a lot faster than other evolves that I raced.

Anyway, we raced from a rolling start at 11kph.  He pulled ahead of me by about 10 feet.  That lasted for about 45 seconds-- then I blew past him.  He was probably 200  meters behind me by the time I hit top speed.

I hit 51.1 kph but had to ease off the throttle  as a matter of safety.  I would have to make some additional changes to my pivot bushings in order to have felt comfortable going faster.  I estimate the board would do at least  55 kph if I invested more time in tuning the board for high speed stability. Considering I just slapped the drive on a Loaded Talib Flex1 Dance board and swapped/tightened the pivot bushings, the stability at 51.1 KPH was pretty amazing.  

Now, the Evolve GT rider said he had to stay below 75% throttle in order to maintain control.  I believe him.  His board was very powerful.  I rode it briefly.  Punching the throttle was enough to throw many riders off the back of the board.  His brakes were good.  The Revel Kit brakes were far superior.

I think the big difference was control.  The revel Kit is a really solid ride which is why I was able to blow past him while he held back on the throttle.

Interestingly, his remote control told him that he hit 53 kph. "Map my ride" told me that I maxed out at 51.1 kph.  I'm not sure what is more accurate.  But if he actually hit 53kph, then I hit 60.  But I don't think thats the case.  51.1 kph seemed about right.

So its official, a single Revel Kit Drive is faster than a 4WD Landwheel L3x both in acceleration and top speed.

The following chart shows our drag race.  Check out the last big spike.  You can see we matched speeds at 11 kph then raced.  the acceleration curve on the Revel Kit looks like a perfect straight line on a 95 degree angle.  You can see the same behaviour in the braking curve.  I think I used almost 100% brakes to scrub off enough speed to make the right angle turn that was ahead of me.

![image|331x461](upload://fi9BZzSEZmxXHnvHmpI2m0U9WJg.png)

One last comment is that 4WD likely has some high speed stability advantages over 2WD.  I cant really make a 1:1 comparison becasue  my 4WD setup has a Loaded vanguard Deck.  But I did take the 4WD machine down the exact same path last year at 49.1 KPH and I recall it was effortless to maintain high speed control.  It took some concentration and corrections to keep the 2WD Revel kit on a tight line.  I don't know how much of that was due to the different deck choice but I'm sure some of the difference was attributable to 4WD.

Hey @pkasanda

nice review.

What do you use the wheel size?
For the same battery voltage, the same motor KV, the maximum speed depends on the wheel size.
```

Same wheel diameter as the L3-x.  90 mm.

What I learned today is that maximum speed in practive depends largely on the straight line stability of the entire system.  If I had a death wish, I could have kept accelerating at least up to 55, posibly up to 60 kph. Who knows...I'm just guessing. But I had to ease back the throttle at the limits of where a minor course correction started to have twitchy outcomes.  

The same can be said of the modified Evolve GT.  The GT rider claimed he never got past 75% throttle because he was not confident the his board could maintain a steady course.  In theory, his skateboard could have out accelerated mine from start to finish.  Instead, I overtook him within 45 seconds and left him  hundreds of meters behind by the time I hit my own limit.

Considering how little time I spent setting up the board for speed I think 51.1 is pretty impressive.  Acceleration and braking were phenomenally effective.  

I should say that no one should take any electric skateboard out of the box and aim for top speed.  And that's certainly not what I did.  The night before I did ten short test runs while I swapped in better quality bushings and experimented with the tightness of the pivot bolts.  I ran out of bones Barrel  bushings so I was only able to swap out the top bushings for bones medium cone bushings. Swapping out the lower barrel bushings would have really helped the high speed stability.

It would have been extremely dangerous to attempt such a high speed with all four of the stock pivot bushings and without adjusting the pivot bolt tightness. 

Road conditions are also critical. This was also done on a perfect streatch of pavement with no cracks or potholes.

Hi Jason:

It was a one time test becasue we were all curious to know how fast it could go. But I did take precautions. I have the prototype strapped together with two velcro straps becasue I know the protype is more fragile than the injection molded version will be.  I also wore full safety gear including a padded motorcycle Jacket (sholder pads, spine protector& Elbow pads), and knee & Shin pads and of course a helmet.

But if it makes you feel better, I'm finished with the high speed test and long range test.  I won't be riding it much more except for taking video and drone footage.

Congratulations on an amazing product.  The braking and acceleration are perfect.  The geometry of the trucks give a very stable ride.  The battery range is excellent.  The direct drive hub motors are very powerful with great cooling.  The 90mm complete Urethane wheels keep the vibration low and the traction is excellent.  One Revel kit accelerates faster and brakes more effectively than a 4WD landwheel.  The Revel Kit with the extended range 216 WH battery has two or three times the range compared to a 4WD landwheel with two batteries.

I am really impressed and I have now again in a very large parking garage here at the airport with two Evolve driver with my 4wheel landwheel a race made every floor and then down the guys were good and had a lot of grip in the corner but in terms of acceleration and  I was able to decelerate it for me ... it was really fun despite 20kg lighter opponents but it is also an advantage to be able to brake with the front axle because the ground was very smooth and a bit dusty ... now I read the revel  even more effective braking and accelerating much easier and you can lift your nose I could use twice in the race .... it is too good to be true.  2 times drove this route and both batteries were down to a blue dot ... I'm really curious to hold this weapon (ordered with 216Wh) in the hands

Hi Germane:

I would love to watch a video of you racing.  It sounds like you have "mad Skills"

I think you completely understand that the most important part of speed is CONTROL.  The L3X 4WD had acceleration and braking curves that were superior to any other board I have seen.  There might be some boards that are more powerful but the power can't be controlled in a way that is usable.

The 4WD L3-x was so easy to control that other boards have no chance of keeping up.

One weakness that the L3-x had was the PU on the motor wheels.  They were slippery and the vibration was high.  

With the Revel Kit, the standard 100% Urathane wheels are a huge improvement  to vibration, traction and control.  The wider trucks also make a big difference. The truck Geometry also seems much better. 

The only weakness of the revel kit is the pivot bushings which are easy to replace and should definitely be replaced by the owner.

For those of us who love our 4WD landwheels, its hard to imagine a system that is superior in every way.  Yet the 2WD Revel Kit seems to do that. 

You are correct, by moving the drive system foward 3 inches from the standard bolt holes...

![image|638x476](upload://opL1H8CVw9aJt7Snji7nhhTVvLk.jpeg) 

...I can lift the nose for sharp turns and 180's.  It will be a hard choice for me between 4WD kit and  2WD Kit.

The first thing to do would be to check your battery voltage.  Assuming you have an L3-x, It should be up around 40 - 41 volts.  39 is marginal.  Below that the battery is damaged. If you can find another  36 volt battery (typically 40 volts Peak off charger) then you can test if you landwheel starts up with it.  But don't run the wheels fast and brake becasuse you can pop the ESC if the battery has no room for regen current.  Two 18 volt tool batteries connected in series  will allow you to perform the same test but the same warning applies.

What version of the landwheel do you have?

I went for a long group ride today. 

![image|690x283](upload://vJz4L2K0hksX9Rm5IB1w9LPk6iE.jpeg) 

I rode the 4WD landwheel 26 km, then swapped boards and rode the  2WD revel Kit for another 13 before calling it a day.  Both the 4WD Landwheel and the Revel Kit are the fastest boards in Ottawa by far.  Its not just the acceleration and speed, its the handeling and the ability to travel fast safely and with total confidence. 

The Evolve GT and GTR are pretty fast at accelerating but they are much less stable at high speed.  The Revel Kit accelerates faster and has a much higher top speed. Its only the Modified GTR's that can beat the Revel kit for the first 10 seconds.  Then the Revel kit blows past them. The Evolve boards are too short and the double hung trucks are prone to wobble.  

There is a Mellow board rider in our groups who is half my weight.  He can keep up to me up to his top speed of 46 kph.  His drive has been replaced five times under the 2 year Mellow board warranty.  So you have to wonder how long it will last outside of warranty.  The Evolves also seem to be broken more than half the time.  Thier riders love them but they seem to ride thier back-up boards more often than their Evolves. 

One of the riders in my group has an Inboard M1.  It seemed as fast or faster than the Evolve GTR.  But neither can keep pace with the Landwheel 4wD or the Revel Kit.  None of the other boards are even close -- including the boosted boards, Own Boards, Meepo's. Exway's etc. etc.

The 2WD Revel Kit accelerates faster than the 4WD landwheel and has a higher top speed.  I'm going to try to chart both the acceleration curves for comparison.

So far the Revel Kit prototype has really been a perfect skateboard.  It out performs the 4WD L3-x on acceleration, top speed and more. One 216 WH revel Kit battery gives me the same range as 4 mint Landwheel batteries. My Revel Kit board is one third the weight of my 4WD landwheel -- and I get to tick tack around the turns becasue the nose is so light.  

The Revel Kit Trucks are wider and have much more stable geometry compared to the Landwheel.  The Standard Urethane wheels grip the road far better than the soft Landwheel motor sleeve urethane. My only caution is that the stock bushings need to be replaced immediately in order to take advantage of the Revel Kit at higher speeds. The stock bushings are only safe up to about 30 - 35 kph.  As soon as you swap in some top notch 95a Cone and barrel bushings, the Revel Kit handles like a race car  at all speeds.

The revel kit acceleration and braking curves are superior to the L3-x.  The thrust is greater but its delivered more smoothly. Acceleration is phenomenally faster than a 2WD L3-x and noticibly faster than a 4WD L3-x.  Same observation for braking.  Shorter stopping distances and perfectly smooth braking from the Revel Kit.  For those of you who found the 2WD Landwheel a little soft in the braking department, the Revel Kit fixes that.  Revel Kit braking also outperforms the 4WD landwheel.  The Revel Kit stops faster and smoother  --  very surprising becasue the 4WD has an extra set of braking wheels. I think a big part of the improvement is that the Revel Kit has much better Urethane.  But the Revel Kit braking power curve is the other big piece of the improvement

I look forward to the final product so I can buy an inventory of batteries.  With just one battery for the protoype I have to be careful about managing my range.  I can go 17 km if I ride the same speed as most riders.  But if I ride at the speeds that the revel kit is capable of the range does drop a bit (just like it does on any electric skateboard).  The extent to which range is reduced by hard acceleration and high speed  is not nearly as sever as it was for the L3-x. Nother nice thing wiht the Revel Kit is that recharge time is much shorter than it was wiht the L3-x batteries. For example, I can match both the range and recharge time of a boosted board G2+ Extended range.  I can do that even when I'm accelerating faster and traveling much faster than a boosted board is capable of.

So I'm routing for Jason and Flo to get the right number of pre-orders in place to go to production.  If you are still  sitting on the fence about whether to upgrade/pre-order, then ask me questions about the prototype.  

What I see so far is in my opinion the ultimate electric skateboard drive.  It outperforms $2500 boards and does not lock you in to any particular style or length of deck.

We L3-x owners all had a thousand suggestions for how to improve the L3-x.  Riding this prototype, I see that its all there.  Range, speed, acceleration, durability, lighter weight, less vibration, better traction, wider truck stance, better carving, improved braking more durable urethane.  It even has a USB port for lighting or for demonstrating to TSA that its a power bank.

I've got two boosted boards and I've test ridden over a dozen different boards in my riding group -- including Pleanty of  set-ups that cost over $2500.  My L3-x 4WD was always better on most dimensions but fell short on range, traction, truck geometry weight and recharge time.  The Revel is superior on every dimension except maximum range.  17 Kilometers on a single battery is good but its not "better than everyone else".  But with multiple batteries the Revel it will win on that dimension also. 

I'll try to get my review video posted.  My daughter is doing the editing.

If you have any question feel free to ask.

Looks really cool.  Do you have an order link for the battery holders? I assume they are not AA sized.

Also, potential risk is that if you hit a bump that causes one of the cells to disconnet for a second, you could pop the ESC.  So you might want to think about having a second battery in parallel.  Maybe a Mepo battery or something like Germane's hover board battery.

I moved back to China last summer and disappeared for a while in the forum becuz of the fire wall of the government. I`m happy to find the way back to this old forum and the group. Very excited about the totally new generation ---revel kit !! already ordered a 216wh kit.

 What`s the most amazing part is that i find i live in the same city as Jason`s factory locates!!
So i just went to his factory and got the possible 1st mass product of new revel kit in the world this Friday!! LOL

Where should i post and discuss things about the new revel kit?  Still this forum or the new link u just posted?

I think you should post in both places.  The  forum is a better public forum.  I see you already have some posts there.


Its my understanding that electric-skateboard.builders forum is now engineered to make it harder to find info on products that are competitive to the products sold by the founder of this forum.  for example, if I search on Landwheel and L3-x, I can't even find the "Landwheel L3-X Reviews thread"  The only way I can find it  is to look at the list of my previous posts and messages.

Thanks for remembering me hahaha. 
i really appreciate the posts u put in the forum, especially the reviews about the new revel kit prototype. U never know how much help those informative and detailed posts did to me and my friends. I decided to buy the new kit once i heard the news because the L3Xs brought me lots of wonderful time.   but I did read ur posts and check ur videos many times before i made up my mind strongly recommending the new kit to lots of my friends. I even translated some of ur posts to Chinese abstracts to discuss with my friends. LOL. I`m glad we have 6 men in the China Revel group now. I`ll keep our group updated about discussion from both forums.

Yesterday, i did some test ride with revel-icarus. the ride is pretty enjoyable, which is smooth ,responsive and reliable. the brake is also powerful during the ride at normal  speed.  I just feel the acceleration of my mass production kit is not stronger than boosted or exway pro and max speed is about 45-46 kph with full battery and 90mm wheels, which are a little different from your prototype kit.

Another thing i want to talk about is the brake at very low speed. i felt that the brake power turned to be weak when i braked to the end, which makes it a little difficult to park my self precisely as i want.    There was also some slide when i pulled full brake,trying to be still on the slope (5-6 degrees). not sure if u came across such conditions during ur tests.
I`m now waiting for the feedbacks from my friends.

Lemon:

The boosted board G2+ on Speed 4 definitely accellerates faster for the first few seconds.  That's because the Kit is moderating the rider's input so there are no sudden jolts.  Its safer but you won't win a short 25 to 50 meter race against a boosted board.  But as soon as the first two seconds are over, the Kit has a much stronger acceleration curve.  It catches up to and passes the boosted board.  That's my experience.

Make sure you are on the fastest Kit Speed.  I have never handled the new remote so I don't know how simple or complicated it is to change speeds.  

I think you also know that there are three different brake settings.

I found the Kit prototype brakes to be perfect for my weight.  Just like the acceleration curve, the braking curve is intended to be soft when you first  pull back on the remote.  

Make sure you are not using the remote like a boosted board remote.  On the boosted board you have to pull back on the remote a little slowly so you don't fly off the front.  With the Kit, you pull back 100% on the brakes then you can release later if you don't want to slow down as fast.

I did not test the revel Kit prototype on many hills.  Yes, a boosted board can maintain position and even back up when you are on a hill.  The Landwheel was never perfect at maintaining position on a hill.  So I understand your criticism.  

In general, the Revel Kit brakes were perfect for me.  I found them very safe and very effective.
But different riders like different things when it comes to brakes.  

Very powerful brakes are great when you use them perfectly. But when you make a mistake, they can throw you on the pavement.  So I prefer very safe brakes over very powerful brakes.

As far as top speed, treat your batteries well and they should become stronger after 6 to 12 charge cycles.  That might help you hit higher speeds.  My prototype had already been ridden by Jason for many months.  So when I recieved it,  the battery was already broken in.

What? You get a higher top speed after 6-12 charges?

[/quote]

The ESC used in the Kit is very similar to the L3-x.  Jason developed the L3-x ESC it to solve a sudden cut-out problem that occurred with the very early V4 Landwheels.  The V4‚Äôs would accelerate like a rocket until they suddenly cut out.  As an electric skateboard accelerates, the battery voltage drops. The V4 basically accelerated until it hit critical voltage and then it would cut-out.

So for the L3-x ESC, Jason programed in a pacing algorithm.  The ESC monitors the battery voltage and as the voltage drops during acceleration, the ESC throttles down to reduce load and keep the battery above critical voltage.

Consequently, a stronger battery will give you better acceleration and higher top speed.

One example of that is the L3-X riders who connected two batteries in parallel.  Their L3-X drives accelerated much faster and reached higher top speeds.

Naturally, a damaged battery has the reverse effect.

We also noticed with the L3-x that range increased from the time it was new.  Jason advised us that this would happen and I certainly observed that it was true.

My son and I notice similar improvements with our boosted boards each spring. They sits idle all winter so the first few rides in the spring have very short range. The range improves with charge cycles and gets back up to the normal range after six to ten charge cycles.

So if you put the two ideas together ‚Ä¶
  - more speed from stronger batteries
  - New batteries gain capacity with proper charge cycles

Then, it is certainly possible that the Kit top speed might improve with some proper charge cycles.

However if the batteries are over depleted then the reverse would happen.  So eskate riders should always stop on the first vibration alert instead of just slowing down to squeeze more distance out of a battery.  Think of your battery like it is a horse that you care about.  As soon as the horse is exhausted, you need to let the horse rest and you need to feed it.  If you just keep riding the horse at a slower speed, you can travel further but you are doing damage to the health of the horse.

Similar experience with hub motor systems like exway and backfire but they seems slightly better than my revel direct drive.Not sure how about other direct drives. 

As a boosted rider for most time, I`m wondering if it`s possible to add boosted brake mode into revel system. Users can change to their preferred brake mode on the remote. Exway pro supports this and i think it`s practical.

  I see what u mean about the race between boosted and revel. For me, the acceleration of revel is pretty linear, making it very smooth and controlable. I think boosted acceleration is more dynamic, which makes me feel more passionate and excited. 
    
the new remote is still simple i think and has more great functions while I feel that the acceleration throttle range is a little long and the brake throttle range is a little short.![y1|375x500](upload://2Pptuu0zWdWn8UuG8T9ECovnn5y.jpeg) [Uploading: y2.jpg...]() 

For the brake, I prefer safe brakes over powerful brakes too. 
As far as battery performance, i just used 3 cycles. i`ll wait and see how it is after 10 cycles. The top speed of mass production may get slightly limited. Jason told me speed over 45kph consumes much power and put much load to the whole system. so it`s possible that they lower the top speed.

If you want more speed, then  A second battery in parallell or 4WD is a sure fire way to do that.  That's been my experience.  I've always used multiple L3-x batteries but others have paralled in third party batteries.

Rememer that Jason's ESC monitors battery voltage and throttles back when the voltage starts to drop.  So more amps of battery power results in less voltage sag which allows the ESC to operate without holding back

For 4WD, i'd be really surprised if the Revel Kit did not go significanlty faster than a 4WD L3-x.  I guess i'll find out soon

My revel kit arrived today. I have the range+ batteries with a 2wd kit.

I only spent about 10 minutes on the board, cruising at fairly low speed. The reason is because it's dark out and was raining earlier so pavement is slippery. Anyway, I want to get my first impressions out there.

The torque is superior to the Landwheel. I was getting wheelspins up steep hills and went 20 km/h and had to ease off on throttle (wet pavement, but still) those same hills the Landwheel struggled on and went almost walking pace.

The breaks almost got me to a complete stop down the same hill... Not quite, but almost. The Landwheel rolls significantly faster. Breaks will probably work better on dry pavement though. Will try again tomorrow.

The remote is great, beyond expectations for me. It paired instantly and automatically out of the box. The display shows all the information you need. Feels even better in the hand than the Landwheel remote, which I liked a lot. Scratches easily though, and no satisfying plastic film to peel :frowning: also wish the strap was adjustable because I have tiny wrists. It is swappable though so that is a minor complaint.

Handling is hard to judge as I haven't gone far or fast, also was on wet pavement. The bushings seem a bit too soft for my liking though. The wheels and trucks absorb vibrations well, I don't feel the need to change wheels or rubber paddings, my thoughts on that could change after more riding though.

The overall fit and finish feels premium, materials look and feel nice. Swapping batteries feels a bit stiff and hard, I will probably get used to it soon though. The charging dock is great. It is tiny and light and just snaps on. The box art is minimalistic but does the job.

It was well worth the wait, and I am a satisfied customer :)

Didn't sell any. Had some interest from people overseas, but realized shipping would be too much, will ask Germane. Now it has been a few months of them sitting though. I would need a volt meter to verify the condition before being comfortable selling.

Um... I said in my first impressions.

"Swapping batteries feels a bit stiff and hard, I will probably get used to it soon though"

I then changed battery again and tried to take it out. Spent about 30 minutes yesterday, pushed down the little release button and I pull with all my strength, even ended up pulling my body weight so I slid on the floor... Surely this is not by design. Now it's the next day and my hands have rested, still can't get it loose, even after riding 9 kilometers.

Anyone else experiencing this? also I would appreciate tips on how to get the battery out easier, until I succeed I have a non replacable battery :sweat_smile:

Can you post a video and some pictues of all three sides of the battery.  Also try this.  Push the battery back in towards the back of the drive as you push on the release button.  Jiggle the button a few times,  then try to remove the battery again with the release button depressed.  I think something similar happened to me the very first time I tried to remove the kit battery.  I think I pulled out on the battery before I noticed the release button.  then I could not pull it out because I had jammed the catch into place.  When that happened, brute force did not work. I had to push the battery back into place and use the release catch as it was intended to be used.  Depress button first, then slide out.

I rode it to the office, hence why it is dirty. I don't think a video will give any information. The battery does not budge one inch. I did follow your recommendations.

I never pulled my battery out without pressing the button. I only changed battery once successfully. So I have never actually ejected this battery.

I have disassembled and studied the latch mechanism.  Can you confirm that you have a full 1/8 inch of travel when you depres the release button.  Also sorry for asking a silly question, but also confirm that you are pushing down on the plastic release button not backwards on the rubber USB port cover.  Answer those two questions and I'll we'll talk more about how to get the battery released.

ok,

There are two possibilities.

the less likely possibility is that the battery is jammed on the track.  I think that's really unlikely because there is just nothing to catch on.

The more likely situation is that the button mechanism inside the battery is not properly depressing the latch that springs up from below the drive.  

The battery button is supose to push the latch down flush with the top of the drive so that the battery can slide out past the latch.

So stop trying to force it.  I'm going to make a video to try to illustrate how to release the mechanism without damaging either the drive or the battery.  

Until then, just charge the unit that you have without trying to take the battery out.  Let Jason  and Flo know you have a problem and that I'm trying to help you.

Lets keep the conversation here in this thread until we get things figured out.

Hey @BearBoi that's a bummer! But no worries, we should be able to find a way to get you back to a swappable battery kit :laughing:

We have not seen or heard of any other instances of this happening, so we'll have to somehow try to find a way to replicate your scenario. 

I'm leaning to believe it's not the actual button release at fault here. It just sounds hard to believe it would break, especially since this is a brand new battery.

My first thought is that the battery is somehow jammed in place, since you mentioned not being able to nudge it not even a bit, which I think would be the case if the release button was indeed broken. 

I know this might be a long shot BUT you did mention you have "tiny wrists" at some point! :grimacing: Is there any way you might be able to get some assistance from someone able to apply more leverage into removing the battery? By no shape or form is this normal, but I'm thinking once we are able to remove the battery it will just be a lot easier to understand where the issue lies. 

@pkasanda As always, your willingness to help fellow riders is commendable and greatly appreciated :raised_hands:

@revel_flo

**Edit:
I watched the VIdeo again and its crystal clear that the bottom of the battery button is sliding off the top of the latch mechanisim tha spring up from the ESC enclosure.  The only way for this to happen is that the latch is on a 45 degree angle tilting forward.  There is no way to force the battery out of the drive.  We need to push the top of the latch towards back into a vertical position.  Then the battery button can propely engage the top of the latch.  The best way to do this is proceedure 2.  Use a slim putty knife to slide between the battery and the drive. Then use the putty knife to push the latch back to vertical.  If we get the latch back to vertical then the battery release button may work.
**End of Edit.

Flo:

I suggest that BearBois does not get two people involved in trying to forcefully release the battery.  The most likley outcome of that will be a broken shell on the drive. Specifically, the front of the shell near the latch will break off. Then you have to replace the whole drive and you never find out what the original problem was.

I think the best solution is to find a gentle way to release the mechanism.  I'm pretty sure there is no way for the track to jam the battery into place so it must be the latch that is not releasing.  If you look at the video, the button is exhibiting a stick and slip behavior.  I think the bottom of the button is slipping off of the top of the latch and the latch is not getting depressed.  I've disassembled and studied these two mechnisms.  For the stick and slip behaviour to happen, the latch is most likely leaning forward instead of perpendicular. Leaning backward is another possibility.

Potential causes:
1) improper assembly
2) Latch leaning forward --Customer pulled forward on the battery without pushing battery release or with the battery button not fuctioning properly
3) Leaning backward -- Battery hit an obstacle while in motion.

If you want to find out exactly what went wrong then you  invest in sending out a new unit and having BearBois Ship the malfunctioning Unit back to One of us (Jason, Paul or Flo).  I am confident I coudl get the battery released without further damage and I would be able to determine what happened.  Jason could probably do the same.  Your an engineer so you could probably do it also. Germane in Germany or Technotron in the Netherlands is another option.  I think they have the skills to release the battery and perform some diagnostics.

If you want to try to first try to fix this remotely then here are a few methods:

1) Procedure 1: Gently tap the battery back towards the rear of the drive. This manuver would hopefully push a latch that was angled forward in to a more vertical position.  Then hopefully the battery release mechanism would function without slippin off of the top of the latch.

2) Proceedure 2: use a very thin putty knife blade.  slide it between the drive and the battery.  See if it is possible to push the latch from a forward leaning position to a vertical position. When the latch might be vertical, depress the battery button.  Hopefully it will not slip off the top of the latch and the battery can be released.


I have a theory to offer about what might have caused the Latch to shift from vertical to angled.  When I first got my revel kit, I could not remove the battery. I hammered on it and eventually got it out.  In the process I cracked the front of the drive cover,   I later realized that I was pushing the USB cover thinknig it was the battery release button. I think that there should be some product design change like a red button to distinguish the release button from the USB port cover. I think something similar might have happened with Bearbois but I'm not saying its his fault.  The USB cover looks exactly like the release button but it is more visible than the release button.

If this is indeed what happened then repairing the unit would likely involve replacing the ESC cover plate, and the latch.  

It is also possible for the latch to be just shifted out of position. If this was the case then no replacement parts would  be needed.  The solution would be some disassembly and reassembly to get the latch back into its proper position.  I don't think the battery button would need to be replaced.  I don't think it is part of the problem.

3)Proceedurre 3: if it is not possible to remove the battery using one of the first two procedures, then this is the least destructive procedure. Use  a three inch exacto knife blade and a light hammer to cut the latch from left to right.  So, insert the exacto knife blade to the left of the latch.  Then lightly hammer the blade towards the right until the latch severs. you would need a firm hand on the knife handle while hammering. This should release the battery allowing further inspection.  I think this method is too dangerous for the customer becasue the customer could cut themselves.

As per above, don't get a friend involved in forcing the battery.   Don't try to force the battery yourself.  If you try those things you will break it to the point that you have nothing to ride.

@BearBoi
CC @revel_flo  , @Landwheel_Jason 

Bear:
I have created a video to show you what I think is jammed and how to release the battery.

Before you try the procedure in the video, give the battery a little shove towards the back of the drive.  Just a quick shove with the palm of your hand.

https://youtu.be/gFsXTZWnoSE

Don't read too much in to the broken plastic.  All the plastic was 3D printed and it arrived in ottawa with alot of cracks already.  I did a real number on it the first time I tried to get the battery out. THen I rode it hard and might have hit a few obstacles.  These white 3D printed parts are not representative of the strength of the black injection molded polycarbonate plastic that makes up the Production Kit.

But I do think there is one Flaw in the Kit Design.  The rubber USB cover looks more like a battery release button than the actual button does.  I suspect @BearBoi and I both made the same mistake.  So something should be done so that others don't make the same mistake.  Posting some information is a good start.  But I think the Latch button needs to have a different color and Maybey the product should ship with two stickers.  "USB Cover"  and "Battery Release"

I can definitely see how the USB cover can be mistaken for a release button, I never did that though. thinking back I think the reason mine got jammed could be due to sliding the battery in too fast?

I haven't found anything thin enough to slide in between the gap. Tried with my thinnest knife, only the tip got in. A very thin putty knife would likely work. I can check with a hardware store this weekend.

@BearBoi

when you do find something thin enough, only push the latch back about 3/16th of an inch (less than 1/8th of an inch). That should be enough to get it into alignment with the bottom of the release button.

If you need something really thin, an old flat razor blade would do the job. Hot glue it to the end of a screw driver and use the non sharpened edges to push against the latch.

![image|97x60](upload://hxspVwzVqgGHWv0WIN2JT7PERuO)

![image|245x61](upload://mPucVCpr9ZBT11uRgeb91BQvpGg)

Tap the release button gently as you push back the latch to explore when you have a good contact where the button does not slip off the edge of the latch.

Try to take some well lit  video of the procedure.  If it works, someone else may need itin the future.

Another option to make a thin shim would be to cut up an aluminum soft drink can.  The aluminum is so thin that you can cut it with a pair of kitchen sissors. However, the thinnest shim is going to be the razor blade

Thanks!  That means a lot!  I am going to be finishing it up with the rest of the batteries soon.

I will definitely let you know when I come back, I am at school in Riverside, SD is my home tho.  Didn't know you were down there!  The Revel kit is pretty awesome I would love to try it out

It's thin enough, but once it reaches the button it is too weak and crumples up. Gonna go to the mall now and get a straight razor, they are a lot sturdier than a soda can. Hopefully that will work.

Hardware store.  Thinnest putty knife that you can find.  That will be the strongest
Or a regular scalple style exacto knife handle and blade.
I'm worried the straight razor won't be strong enough if the soda can did not work

Managed to get a wedge in further. Hard to know what it does inside because I can't see anything. The button is still slipping and not releasing however.

Also my rubber cover has come off, I realize it should not be able to. I tried to push it back in with tweezers, but no luck there either :/ this battery is just giving me heaps of headache

Also, if you can wedge one or of these on either side of the latch:
![image|287x275](upload://1tTy85kNmhWfRMCoup745vi3lOK.png) 

Then that might lift the battery up enough to make room for one of these to push on the latch.

Update. I did go out to look for a hardware store. Apparently all hardware stores in my city are closed on Sundays...

I did get a stronger soda can piece which held up well, I could not feel it hit any part going in. I could only jam the button even further in certain positions. I was careful not to over do it so I checked the button each time I got further in. I don't think the locking mechanism is wedged forward. Might be wedged back or something else entirely. 

As for Using cooking oil and lifting the battery? Is there not a high risk of that cracking the frame? Would be nice to see what's catching, but I'm worried of breaking things that way.

@BearBoi:

Lets assume the latch is tilted in a way that it is weged in place.

That means we will need to cut the latch.

Can you ask Jason to ship you a new latch and an extra cover plate for the ESC enclosuer.  We want the cover plate just in case it is already damaged.  

The latch is a small part that should be easy to cut and replace.  but don't cut it now or you will have nothing to drive.

When you have the spare parts, I'm going to have you insert an exacto knife blade like this

![image|211x219](upload://xLEJWTwszlWPmrTaIw1U2KNFXmB.png) 

 The blades need to be mounted in the proper knife handle.  Then insert the blade to the left of the latch and use a small hammer to tap the blade to the right. Hammer as close as possible to the latch.  If yo ulike, you can put some duct tape or masking tape on the battery to protect it from getting scratched.

We will use some cooking oil as a cutting lubricant. Just a little bit of oil to coat the blade so it cuts and slides better.  Polycarbonate is oil resistant and we are going to clean all the oil off right away anyway.  

Once you slice through the latch, leave the knife blade in between the two cut halves so that the broken part of the latch does not spring up into the battery cavity.  The battery should then slide out.

Wear some leather gloves to protect your hands and never slice towards you.  Always stand on the dull side of the blade and hammer away from you.

I think a dozen light taps should slice through the latch

Do you feel comfortable wiht that procedure.  If so, please contact Jason for the two parts.

Here are two battery hacks:

 https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/landwheel-l3-x-reviews/45697/460

A landwheel L3-x will run of of just about any 36 volt battery, however, you uneed to bypass the BMS becasue if it wired through the BMS then the ESC will get fried the first time the BMS disconnects the power. 

also, Andrew Penman lives in Australia and has a few Landwheels.  You could connect with him on facebook or youtube to see if he has any functioning LW batteries.

https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=Andrew%20Penman

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB79c1khdTE

Either that or sell your Landwheel for parts and order a Revel Kit.  There is good demand for L3-x ESC and drive assemblies.

Sounds straight forward enough, what is the easiest way to get a hold of Jason? is that through the official Revel email, or through this forum?

I practically became an esk8 surgeon from owning the LW, this sounds easy enough and uses things I have at home/can cheaply get. I will film the whole procedure and of course wait until I have replacement parts.

Is the ESC cover removed with just screws, or is it glued shut? as long as the cover is easy to remove, replacing the latch should be simple from what I could see in the video you sent.

@BearBoi:
Send a PM to @Landwheel_Jason  with your shipping details and email address.

CC me and @revel_flo on the PM.  I'll copy and paste the info to Jason on Skype and in an email with a CC to you (just incase he does not get the PM notification).

I have already sent him a list of parts.

1) Latch
2) Polycarbonate ESC cover  (the part you remove to access the ESC)
3)Battery button
4) Rectangular battery button spring.
5) Rubber USB cover (Bear Bois says it has fallen off)

The ESC cover is removed easily with just six screws.  No glue.

When it comes time to cut the latch  I think this is the safest way to secure the kit and stay clear of the blade:
1)  put the skateboard upside down on a carpet or on soft ground
2)  Put your feet on each tip of the skateboard to hold the work in place
3)  Hold the knife handle in your left hand with a thick leather glove.
4) Insert the lubricated blade into the latch cutting position
5) Drape a cloth over the battery to protect it  or tape folded cardboard into place.  Or put the knife through a rectangle of cardboard before you  insert the blade  to the left of the latch.
6)  Hammer lightly with your lright hand. Staying close to the latch
7) Make sure there is nothing behind the blade to get sliced if the blade breaks.  Keep you feet and ankles far from the blade.  Lean your butt up against a wall or sit in a chair if you need more blance.

Please show these precautions in  your video.
Compare the broken latch to the new latch.  I think the eyelets will be broken.

I have had the revel kit now for 8 days. First hour  my battery got stuck. A few days later, my USB cover came off. Yesterday I was having a new problem. This time, I don't know how to diagnose the issue.

My board turned itself off twice yesterday. Both times were on "low battery" still 2 bars and over 20% battery. I never go down to critical levels. The first time it would not turn on until a bit later when I got into the office and it warmed up a bit. I think temperature might have something to do with it as I am in Sweden and it's between 0-10 Celsius this time of year.

I then charged my board up to full and rode home. On the last 200 meters same thing happened again. I have let it rest since, this morning I can't even charge the battery, and it won't turn on.

Because the battery is stuck, I have no way of disassembling and troubleshooting. First thing I would do is check with another battery, but I can't. The USB port outputs current but that doesn't really say much as it is much lower voltage than the kit needs.

I sent Jason a Skype message asking him to take over.  I'm sure he will take care of you .  When you get your replacement or replacement parts, just make sure you shut down on the very first vibration alert, especially in cold weather.  I don't think its a good idea to ride long distances in temperatures as low as 0 degrees.  If you do ride in the cold it is probably better to stop at 50% battery power instead of 20%.

At this point there is not much that a fellow customer can do to help you remotely.  I think Jason should try to get the drive back to china so that he can study the problems that you have encountered.

Like I said, I'm sure he will take care of you.

Only once, when it actually turned off. I never ignore vibration alerts. Furthest I have gone is to the second vibration (20% on kit) Last time was odd actually. I looked at the display and it say low voltage on remote, not the kit, and then it said disconnected.

I don't remember the details the first time, I know I was on 2nd speed mode full throttle up hill the second time, that is when I got low voltage on remote and disconnect.

So when you get back on the road again be much more careful with cold weather.  Voltage can drop very quickly with small batteries in cold weather.  Normally, the first vibration means stop immediately.  In cold weather, I don't think you should ride past 50%.  That means you would stop long before the first vibration alert.  I have similar comments on hard uphill accelertion in cold weather.  Hard accelleration causes battery voltage to drop quicky.  The drop in voltage would be more rapid in very cold weather.  So hard uphill acceleration in very cold weather with less than 50% battery would be a triple bad combination.

I remember wiht my L3-x.  I tried riding it in 0 degree weather.  I could only make it around the block before the battery started fading and vibrating.  So I stopped riding in cold weather.  I'm not trying to blame you for these problems.  But we all have to pay attention to what works and does not work.  The batteries are the most vulnerable part of any electric skateboard.

I see, I know to be careful on low battery, Hence speed mode 2 and not 4. Didn't know cold weather had such high impact, in the manual it warns of -20 I think and it was maybe 5+ yesterday. I do think some more detailed care & safety instructions would be nice. In my mind I was not in a risk zone at all on low speed mode and before first buzz, seems I was wrong :/

Like I said, I'm not trying to blame you.  These boards and batteries are designed tested in China, not sweeden.   One of my cars is a Nissan Leaf.  It has a massive battery and it also has a battery heater for cold weather.  Electric skateboards do not have battery heaters.  We might not think of these things ahead of time but when a battery fails in colder weather, we need to re-evaluate the reasonable limits of a small lithium battery.

I'm going to give some thought to whats happened and perhaps write up a warning for other customers.

One more thing to think about.  Low speed mode might not offer much protection.  Lithium batteries recover voltage after you let off the throttle.  So riding on low speed mode might allow you to deplete the battery much more before you hit a vibration alert.  I think its hard to explain but if low battery threashold is 36, then low speed mode could let you deplete to 37 without a vibration, then the battery recovers to 38, then you deplete to 37 with some light throttle,  The ESC is going to reduce acceleration to maintain voltage.  If you travel a good distance this way then the charge could be much more depleted than is indicated by the voltage.  The recovered voltage is a very shallow charge.  

Think of a car battery.  If you crank in cold weather, the battery may drop from 14 volts down to 10.  when you stop cranking, the battery may recover to 13 volts but its a very shallow 13 volt charge. If you measure the battery wiht a volt meter then it looks like a fully charged battery.  But if you measure the battery under load with a cold cranking amps meter, then you see just how shallow the charge is.

An ESC measures only voltage to identify the charge level of the battery.  So the recovered voltage can be misleading to the ESC.  Cold weather and low speed mode might be a bad combination because it could delay the vibration alert.

This makes sense when you explain it. Batteries to me have always been a bit of an unknown, tried to do research but not much is known about best practices, especially for e-skate. It's a learning experience for sure. As for reviving this battery, is there anything I can do? I have seen some boosted board riders ride their boards turned off until it gets enough power to accept a charge. Is this a reasonable thing for me to do aswell? I also wonder if leaving it plugged in to the charger would help, or even risk damaging it? I have just left it as is at home and I have not done any real attempts of recharging the battery after seeing the charger show green.

Once a battery is damaged it is doomed.  I after overdepleting one LW battery, I was aboe to resurect it by boosting from another LW battery.  However it only lasted another week and it was dangerous because it caused spontaneous braking.  The only thing you could do wiht the kit battery is to disassemble it, charge each cell wiht a single cell charger, then test each cell and replace the damaged cells.  I've never tried it with a revel kit battery.  I judt know that in theory its possible.  Personally, I would rather see the drive and battery returned to Jason so that he can reverse engineere how the battery got stuck.

My battery started working by itself now after being left untouched in room temp for a while, so I'm guessing it was not that badly discharged after all so I think it's fine, I'll just stay above 50% and be careful for a bit. If Jason wants to examine the drive, that's fine but for now it's alive again :slight_smile:

@BearBoi if you open an disasemble the battery, please take some pics, i'm really  interested about how is built this battery for maybe a future DIY upgrade... 
Do you have the 158Wh battery or the (long) range battery  ?
By the way @pkasanda, i suspect a problem with my battery, i can't reach more than 40km/h with 90mm wheels ( 85kgs rider, flat ground , no wind, full charge ) and i have my first alert around 4kms with a moderate aggressive riding in 4 speed mode. I never drain totally my battery and never did dumb thing.
@revel_flo @Landwheel_Jason , do you think this specs are normal ?
But first thing, i LOVE my revel kit, for me it's a perfect city commuter, the ride is really smooth. You did an awesome job guys !

@BearBoi
Now that I have the production revel Kit, I;ve studied it in great detail and I'm starting to think that there is nothing wrong with you battery.  I'm wondering if when you put your hand on the back of the battery, you are actually holding the battery and the drive at the same time.  The battery only stick up about 1/4 inch from the back of the drive.  I wonder if you re putting your hand on the back of the drive and pulling forward  thinking that you are pulling on the battery. 

So instead of putting you hand on the back of the unit, place your palm on the very top of the battery and slide forward as you push down the release button.

If that does not work, do what Flo said and get a friend to help you.  

I really really can't see how the latch could have been broken on the production model.  The prototype was very fragile so I totally understand how the latch can jam on it.  But the production model should be bullet proof.

[/quote]

Unfortunately, I've never tried the standard size battery.  I would say it's 80/20 that the standard battery is capable of less speed or that your battery is not as strong as it should be.

The 
context that I have is that the L3-x was never strong enough to carry me more than 2 - 4 kilometers until I started doubling the  batteries.  Also the V2 was completely useless with its original battery but it turned out to be a really impressive skateboard if you did the work to substitute a V4 battery.

Small batteries can make excellent skateboards function very poorly.  Larger batteries can turn useless skateboards into  long range rockets.

Here is some more info.  as a 200 lb rider, I could get 17 kilometers of range out of either the 4wd L3-x or the 2WD kit prototype.  But if I rode flat-out, with hard acceleration and at top speed then I could get as little as 6 km of range on either machine.  So I could totally see how a smaller battery could give you not much more than 4 km of range if you are are riding fast and accelerating hard.

I should also point out that if a battery is damaged, you really can't go anywhere on it.  It should  only take you one or two blocks or maybey less.

So I think in the end, you need to buy the extended range battery.  If you are disappointed with the standard range battery, I think Jason would give you a special price on the extended range batteries.  If I were you, I'd order two and ask for a discount based on the standard range battery not meeting your needs or expectations.

I suspect that if you have Jason ship you another standard range battery that you will just be disappointed again. I suspect your weight and riding style are not consistent with what the standard range battery has to offer.

Again, I have ot say that i'm guessing because I have never ridden a standard range battery.

Hey Fred:

Befor you give up on standard range batteries, try one little experiment.  I have a theory that setting the wheel size on the remote may actually affect the top speed.  So for example 110 mm wheels as a setting may limit the max RPM to less than it would be with a 90mm setting.  

So set the remote wheel size setting  to the minimum size and see if it improves your actual top speed.

Look at GPS/Phone speed, not the remote speed indicator.

This was my first thought aswell, I studied my other battery to make sure I was not grabbing onto part of the kit. There is a little indent in the back of the battery, that is where I curl my fingers in and pull towards me. I did get the battery out once before having problems, that time it slid out fairly easily without much force.

I'm not super strong, but I also wouldn't describe myself as weak. I have held the drive down with my feet and pulled with a significant amount of force while pressing down the button as far as it goes. I can definitely ask someone to help, but I think the risk of something breaking is greater than the success chance :confused:

Yes, saw the video, I tried it. Had my girlfriend push the button so hard it hurt her fingers, and me push so hard with my palms it made them red and blue üòÖ no luck unfortunately.

@FredXanadu  mentioned spending an hour with a friends help. I will need a way to release it easier than myself and someone else.

@pkasanda unfortunately your warnings came true even though the battery did revive itself over night. This time it happened again, this time not shutting itself off. But I turned it off myself and the next morning it would not take a charge. Wasn't even low on battery, I rode maybe 2 kilometers. This time the USB port doesn't even give out power, so it's clear that battery is done. Makes it even more important to get this battery out.

As for lubrication, would armor-all be my best bet? I don't think I have any suitable lubricant at home, would need to purchase one either way.

@BearBoi I tried one hour alone and after my friend coming the first try was the good one !
When you push your release button do you feel something or the button is stuck ?
My battery was glued by some dirt and after cleaning the cases, the battery slide now easily. After seeing your pics, it's cristal clear that you have the same problem than me... You rode on a wet dirt road, and your case is now glued... if you follow attentively my video and if your girlfriend clamps the button between her fingers  ( check the pic below ) ![IMG_6602|666x500](upload://pFAwrmGyNj9pQwu6V3GzJ6OhoLx.jpeg)
she need to push and you pull the battery with your 2 hands like the video. you'll remove the battery, for sure...
Your pics explain everything about your problems, you rode on dirt wet road who killed and glued the battery...

I think you are right, I likely have the same exact problem. It will come loose with enough force, My button is not completely stuck but it does need more force than it should to press down and makes a "click" could be like you say from dirt, there is a lot of grime and dirt, leaves and dust on the road now, a bit of dirt is inevitable.

We did look at your video and did the same thing. I have ridden 100km on it while stuck though which likely just makes matters worse. I want to use something to lube/remove dirt. I have a WD-40 like spray, but I'm afraid that would damage the plastic, do you have any suggestions on how to clear the dirt and help get my battery out?

I don't think we can brute force it because it doesn't move any, and we uses a lot of force with the drive held down with feet just like in your video.

1) if you look attentively the video, my friend first only push the button, the battery don't slide... It starts to slide when he clamps the button between his fingers. it"s a key point of the procedure.
2) your girlfriend NEED TO CLAMP BETWEEN HER FINGERS the button
3) you pull the battery with your 2 hands, your feet under the truck to have a good leverage.

You don't need to brute force only to be synchronized.

PS : I rode 120 kms of the parisian streets :slight_smile: 

Try again, you'll win this time !

@BearBoi:
Armor All is a silicone based spray that is designed for plastic and makes plastic very slipery.  Thats why I suggested it. In general Polycarbonate is very oil and chemical resistant.  

In addition to fred's video technique, what about using a little leverage.  This is a 2x3  but  a 2x4 or 2x2 would also work.  Just put the tip of the board into the notch on the back of the battery and lever against the motors while simultaneoulsy pushing on the battery button.  I don't think you should need to push hard on the battery button.

Getting help to attempt it today. Will update tonight. My battery seems to work fine though. Not sure how to know if any damage has been done.

I have learned to live with revel batteries in my climate. Like you said, never ride far or push it hard in cold. Another thing that helps a lot, and I have had 0 issues since doing this. Keep the battery warm and plug it into a charger as soon as I get home. Also keep the board in a warm spot and keep it warm with body heat, heaters, towels. Whatever is nearby.

I also am very careful about not idling for long or cruising for long in situations I know it will get cold. I don't think there is any damage to the battery, I have had no issues for a week now since I really payed attention to maintaining my kit.

If your voltage fresh off the charger is  the same for both batteries then both should be fine.  The correct voltage for the L3-x batteries was 41 - 41.5.

I remember wrapping scarves and clear food wrap around my L3-x batteriy & drive so that I coud do some late season testing.  But I only did that once because my L3-x arrived  in December.  That was back in 2017.

Best not to push your luck with cold weather.

Gotcha, yeah in December-february I think my kit will spend its entire life in my apartment. boxed up. So far it's usually not that cold out. I'll stay careful and keep an eye on the thermometer when going out.

Been above 10 celsius recently which I think should be fine with proper care. I won't be wrapping any scarves or food wrap, I will let it rest during winter season.

@FredXanadu and @pkasanda I got the battery unstuck this weekend. It is very tight, but I found a technique that works for me.

I used a long metal shoehorn for leverage and pushed on the back of the battery instead of pulling. Cleaned it and put it back, stuck right away. Seems I always need to use the shoehorn.  Works for now though :) I'll look into lubricating and or lightly sanding it in the future. For now this works.

My kit is more alive than ever and I will write a proper review of my whole experience soon.

Hi guys. I just wanted to post an update with regards to the team at landwheel.

I have a really bad unit that eventually ended with a broken axle. This was at the time Landwheel stopped and started development of the new Revel kit. At the time Jason said to me he would replace my device with the new one once its developed.

Its been a year later and true to his word, Jason replaced it :slight_smile:
There are not many people in this world that stick to there word so this was a brethe of fresh air.

I want to publicly thank Jason and the Landwheel/ Revel team.

As for the device..... Its really good :) 
I have only had a few trips on the board but from what I can gather, its much better!
The new batteries are trustworthy the option of using all 4 skate wheels (Like boosted) is really smooth. 

From my experience, I hope Revel take off. The customer service is something I can vouch for :)

For those in Europe, anyone know where to order more revel batteries from? 
From the US there will be customs charges and they usually high.

Sorry I read through the thread but there so much. I have issues with my land wheel v2, battery is charged but doesn‚Äôt work. Now does someone have a guide to either fix it, create a new battery from scratch, or is there someone who can make one and I‚Äôll pay for it. I‚Äôm in London, I did see one of you guys is in London

Be careful with Armor all. It can discolor some plastics. I believe there are similar automotive products that do no do that.
