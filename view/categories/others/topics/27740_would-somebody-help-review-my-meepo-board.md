Send me one down! 

I'll do different tests in different scenarious, speed, range, durability from vibrations... so on. I have roads in some places still since Soviet Union times, so no better  field for testing :wink: It also would be interesting to try flexy, split enclosure board.

Sure, if you send me one I'll promise to give it an unbiased review.

What's it's current range?
So I know whether to use it at the park or to ride it to the beach. (I'm in Southern California)

thank you guys for being interested.  I run a small company Meepo Board.  So I am not capable to send free board at present stage.   I sold like 50 boards already.   My offer would be that I give a favor discount  to friends who can help me marketing the board some, by review video or somehow.

If you are willing to cover shipping on the board to a reviewer and back then I'm sure you can get lots of people to review the board, but without reviews you're going to have a hard time getting people to pony up cash for a relatively unknown vendor here.

Lots of people recently burned by a new vendor and lots of people who are probably waiting on R2's.  The time to review a board edit a video together and then ship the board back probably is worth more than the cost of the board itself.  Not to be rude just saying it's an economical setup and people value their time, especially if they have skills both in editing and communication.

If a reviewer spends a couple hours charging the board a few times and ride it for a few hours, then cut/edit video of the experience down and give a summary of pros and cons is a considerable amount of work to ask to be done for free (unless the person already has a successful YouTube channel and this is just an opportunity for content that they can make some profit on, Braille or John Hill's channels for example where they make their money from the views).  Say someone spends 10 hrs between testing, editing, and uploading, if they are being paid $30 an hour it's $300 (pro editing software costs about $30 a month from Adobe or more for other software), even if you paid the person $15 an hour it's $150 at which point they should only owe you like $150 for the board (also this is undercutting real photography or editing severely but we're assuming the reviewer is happy to get the board and try out some new hardware).

If your margins are too small and this is impossible to do given the current volume you've sold then just wait it out until it's worth it or take the risk now in hopes that getting more reviews leads to more actual buyers.  Just make sure you give them to people who are trusted on here and ideally have their own shops not in direct competition with your complete so you can get unbiased reviews and feedback.

I'd be willing to buy a board and review it if you would be willing to cover the shipping. I could also post said review to Reddit and get a few other riders to give their honest opinions as well.

I just got my board and put it on the charger. It looks great out of the box. Just curious @kieraneboard which wheel is supposed to activate the smart turn on. Also how do I DE-activate the smart turn on feature? I just read on reddit about how a few users had to rearange the motor phase wires and I want to make sure I don't need to do that. Thanks.

The one on the right.     You can unplug the hall sensor of the right motor to DE.  But its not recommended, that way your motor works on SQUARE WARE.   You dont have any issue, nor do any other customers will have.

So my initial opinion of the Meepo is very positive. The only negative I could muster would be touchy throttle(may be a plus for others). The board is a little beast for the price. It easily tackles all hills around my immediate neighborhood, including some pretty big ones. I didn't notice any excessive heat or voltage sag either. I'm very happy and will update with a more complete review with more use. This thing is badass.

If I purchased a board and you just cover the shipping costs I'd be more than happy to do an extensive review including a video showing all parts of the board and preforming all kinds of tests. I will share on youtube, facebook, and instagram. If it does well (which seeing other reviews it seems it would) I will also encourage my friends to purchase one in the video I make. I will also post a review on your company facebook page. I live in Salt Lake City UT USA and I've been researching almost every kind of Electric board there is. Let me know if this kind of deal works for you

Hello @kieraneboard!!

Your board is so awesome. It definitely stands out of the crowd of electric skateboards under 600 and it is significantly cheaper than most with its specifications. I am very interested in checking it out for myself and I would love to help get the news out about your product if it is indeed as good as it looks on paper!
I don't know if this thread or your offer is still  going, but I'd love to review your board on youtube and social media for a discount code!

Thanks for your time!

Hello Kieran!
I am a college student at Western Michigan University and this product peeks my interest. On a large college campus with many hills, a high-speed electric longboard would be the best mode of transportation. I also work for the office of sustainability and will promote your product to all students on campus as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective board. A discount code would be very useful because I am just a college student with no source of income. Advertising a sub $300 board would boost sales for students all over campus as well as everybody in the office of sustainability. Thank you so much for this amazing product!

Sorry to tell you, but he's shipping so many boards that some are complaining about delays. As a meepo owner I suggest you just buy it at the current price so you aren't disappointed with wait times...its a solid board for less than $400
