This is a small thread of how I converted a 8Ah Sanyo 20700 battery in the Meepo board to two 18V 8Ah batteries of 144Wh so that they can be removed and then carried on select airlines that allow 160Wh batteries. In this case it is Virgin Australia.
The battery is only being split for transport only so there was no issues with charging two separate batteries as they would be charged as one battery when back in the board. 
I split the battery open and found the configuration really easy to make two 18V batteries with. I split the battery in two and then cut the balance wires and fitted a 6S plug and socket to the two batteries then attached a couple of XT60 plugs and power leads then shrink wrapped it all back up. Now the board can be taken on Virgin planes throughout Australia.
