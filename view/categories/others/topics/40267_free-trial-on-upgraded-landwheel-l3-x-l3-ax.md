Hello Everyone, 

Glad to be with you guys to discuss technical problems of electric skateboard, thank you all for your support and help for more than two years. Now we made wide range of improvement according to your suggestions, and sincerely invite you to review it free of charge .

**Please contact us (White@landwheel.com  / Jason@landwheel.com)**


Here is our latest product picture.It seems to be no improvements on the picture, let's see what details we have done.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/1/e159aae78cb37216de3120ac5ae702005f450f8d.png" width="399" height="399">

**1.Replaceable PU wheels**

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/6/c6c520e811e8aa3b56a8aa90a82b04dcddd83645.png" width="312" height="312">
We upgraded the wheels from 83mm to 92 mm, the thickness of the PU wheel increased 9 mm; and the material upgraded from HR85A to SHR 80AA, this improvement is that the wheel is more wear-resisting, increased ride stability, more comfortable.

**2.Remote**

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/6/86bae173c3fcf3a5fd15f1077dc4f2d6345b47bc.png" width="499" height="499">
Although the appearance is the same as before, the PCB inside is completely new design, we added vibration tips on it, so that you can master the status of the skateboard better. The brand new optimized control code and the remote distance upgraded from 10M to 40M, which makes it more effective.

**3.Circuit board**

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/a/aa264185fee40c630898a7770893c631e77f0873.png" width="377" height="377">
The most core part of this update is the whole seal-able circuit board inside an aluminum alloy base, which makes the installation and maintenance more convenient, and avoid the interference of the external environment to effect its performance. This is only the appearance, the new circuit board use sine-wave, dual mode control (can be used with/without hall sensor), linear soft brake, fireproof protection circuit design, 12 safety protections,etc., those functions make the circuit board much better than the previous generation.

**4.Battery**

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/b/fb0dbf5e457b75523fd137326215306e4254f70f.png" width="353" height="353">
There is no change in appearance, but the BMS are new designed. We added different charge-discharge ports inside, the output current is more stable, the regenerative braking system is much effective and safer.

It hard to tell you what comprehensive upgrade we did through these sentences, sincerely welcome skateboard fans to contact us, we will choose some of them to test our products free of charge. We are looking forward for your joining.

The improvements sound amazing! Seems like quite a few earlier issues are solved with this update.
Looking forward to actually testing it out and hearing from other reviewers/testers who have gotten their hands on it first!

Glad to see you guys took our recommendations seriously and improved your previously faulty product. There is a place and customer base for you in the esk8 community as long as you have a durable and more importantly safe product. I'm looking forward to testing out the revamped drives. You might want to hit up Neil "BigKids" on YouTube to test and review your drive.

Good to see you are listening to the community, Jason. I have received tracking for my unit last week, and with a bit of luck I will get it this week or next week. Decent weather provided, I will test the unit to the best of my abilities and report back.

I know @Mikenopolis has had earlier versions of your board. I think he would definately be able to speak to any improvements you've made after trying your new version. Im interested in testing your new deaign as well. Ive emailed you. 

Thanks,

Yep, trust me - we have been working with them since around May/June and it's been a great collaboration. They WANT to make their product better. It simply takes time, but at least they (Landwheel) have been listening with a good amount of feedback going back and forth. I've tested several incremental (unreleased) upgraded LW units and I honestly can't wait to test the L3-X and report back with how far they've come :)

I'd like to try it out, the older version just looked scary, but I can see you've put work into improving the design.

Awesome initiative.
I am riding my v4 almost daily and take it everywhere i can :slight_smile:
Unfortunately the PU Wheels waering off really fast, so i am happy they have changed. Even though i am not sure if the bigger wheels might be to big.

Also the remote had to get an update. With my previous version i was able to turn it off and ok by just pushing the back of the case. This was quite dangerous since it turned off sometimes during the ride. I fixed it with some tiny washers in the case...

Hope the new one will make it a even better board.

i ride my v4 almost daily my only complaints are the PU Wheels wearing  off fast, the brakes take some getting used to, but with a practice you get the hang of them, and last but not least! Available parts for people in EU! i tryed ordering 2 spare PU Wheels and was quoted ¬£40 just for shipping (thats not including the price of the wheels themselves), thats not cost effective.

I just got home from my range test. I only went up to 21mph max. Forgot my skate tool and I had the trucks too loose so decided not to potential street my face. 

My GPS unit indicated the battery fully drained at 4.71 miles from a fully charged battery. I had the throttle down midway majority of the time. Gave it a little push to 21mph on the very smooth asphalt parts. Hopefully the battery will improve after a few cycles. 

The ride itself was great. The larger wheels really made a difference in the ride quality. The FOC (or equivalent) performance was smooth from a stand still and made no bldc type noise. All in all a good board and I would recommend it at the moment. Durability would be the next test. So if it holds up to multiple rides without cracking trucks or battery compartment this would get a thumbs up from me

Beauty of this drive system is the quick set up. I had no real plans for a build until my CarvOn drives and FocBoxes come in... meanwhile I picked up a Jet Spud from @JLabs gripped it and slapped on the Landwheel and I got an Esk8. Ride is finally good enough to recommend to n00bs. Range is my only issue, with under 5 miles per battery this would get expensive to get the range I‚Äôm used to. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/6/8630aeae09622ae47fa18422df14ffc5ada089c4.jpeg" width="499" height="499">
