Has anyone heard of zenboard technology? Theyâ€™re about to launch a kickstarter and it looks like one of the coolest production boards Iâ€™ve seen. ![image|626x334](upload://p6FZx61VAfWIbhioSIJ2wM388po.png) ![image|690x312](upload://6pIwVLEd9VwizafYtwTNTQKLOoi.png) 

Itâ€™s a carbon fiber deck with planetary gear hubs and which appear to have a good amount of 74a thane around them. The board is also controlled by what they call flowcontrol, which senses your body weight to accelerate. Seems interesting, what are your thoughts?

Hub looks like Stary componentry. Didn't they rip a ton of people off?

Stary remake. Flowcontrol? The more unproved concepts, the dodgier this feels. Lost count of the amount of kickstarters that fail to deliver, XTND is another one that was hyped as fuck. Floating remote charge dock station and "Artificial Inteligence" inside the board..loool. They still havn't delivered, soon two years later. 

On a positive note tho. The planetary gear motor is a good concept, it will be noisy as fuck with straight gears, but good concept nonetheless.

I had myself a stary board that broke in 2 days. 
But I still kept the planetary hub ! It's very powerful and works well. 
Tho it makes so much noise even more than belts.

Would be intresting to do a verision with helical gears for noise reduciton, not sure how well it would hold up mechanically tho. Or if its even economically viable

looks like any another cheap chinese hub board to me...

edit: I take it back it looks more polished than the chinese counterparts. For 1300usd, i think it could be a nice competitor to the mainstream boards

I'll stick with reliable remotes

Would hardly call it a production board when only cute renders exist.. :roll_eyes:
To me it looks like a prime example of a scam.
Don't waste your money.

When riding on a board you constantly move on the board and shift your weight, these weight sensing boards are obviously designed by someone that has never skated because it's just not smart.

The only way I'd ride a board with no remote is if its a regular push board.

Like the reduced gearing.  No remote no way.  I'd be jerking around all over the place with that shit.  I move around all over the board when I'm riding.   
@Schulerbible mate I think so.  Sure they were at that Melbourne tech show last year.  Much less refined product but the same weight concept.

Well my guess would be high costs, low income. 22k isn't much to build such a complicated product.
I went to check the campaign and there's no way this board goes 22 miles with this deck even if it was full of batteries (which apparently is not the case as it requires sensors)

Edit: this project is pretty nice too: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1855079651/affordable-top-of-the-line-electric-skateboard?ref=discovery&term=electric%20skateboard :sweat_smile:

I was one of the only US Kickstarter backers who actually received theirs years ago. Got it brand new, hated the planetary gear single drive, promptly sold it in a week. The guy I sold it to offered for me to buy it back for $40 which is a pretty good deal so I did. Gonna try and fix it up and give it away at one of our group rides I think.

Good luck fixing it ! I haven't seen the point to do so.. 
The deck is really bad and much too thin to accept 18650. Only 6 pouch cells can be in there..
I let you imagine the range you can have with the tiny space inside

It's more about the joy of the build than actually riding it haha. It should be a good starter board for somebody, and it does get up hills pretty well for a single planetary drive...

They actually made a Stary V2 board, but the team lost motivation after the whole Kickstarter fiasco and pivoted to scooters. I learned this from chatting with the Metasurf guy, who visited Stary while he was in China looking for factories. Disappointing end for an (in)famous product...

Definitely not 18650 Li-ion battery cells, a deck with this kind of thickness must be assembled with Li-pol battery

Zenboard got cancelled because they infringed on a patent on the leaning to go/stop technology that another brand possessed.
