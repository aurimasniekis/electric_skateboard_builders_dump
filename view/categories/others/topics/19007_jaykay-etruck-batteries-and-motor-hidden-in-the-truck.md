that makes no sense - how many batteries can fit in there? 2 per truck?
A 2S System? The current draw will be enormous.
Range? At 2x2S1P this would give you a maximum of 4*3.6V*3.5Ah = 50Wh (with Sanyo GA batteries).
On Hub motors you get around 1Km per 15Wh --> 3.36Km

Energy consumption per kilometer is highly dependent on riding speed. That number doesn't make any sense to display without any other variables of the board.

 "JayKay says that riders can expect to zoom along at up to 30 km/h (18.6 mph) for a range of 12 km (75 mi)"

Wow 75 miles!!!!

I'm calling it fake until I see a cross section cut of the truck. Even 4 cells seems ridiculous. And obviously real world testing with at least a 150lb individual.

Now I'm cool with the answer. I can also attest to those numbers being legit based on my testing and data logging.  

On the board concept of the topic however, no way it can achieve those numbers and I agree with your earlier comment.

Apparently that is the cross section render:
https://www.jaykay-sport.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/e-longboard-truck-kit.jpg
looks like a notebook battery with those pads to me - probably just some photoshop with a mirrored section of a generic battery

On the instagram however they show this:
https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/16585595_887714261370688_1747102385735467008_n.jpg

looks like two single round 18650 (or even 26650) cells to me.
Edit: Forget it - this is probably just some tape around the motor section to protect it from getting scratched - not actual batteries

Hah i saw the same thing today and also didnt believe how are they going to fit 4 batteries there? 

No way they that they can put 4x of 18650 per truck, maybe max 2, but how about structural strenght?

I think this idea is way off :smiley: 

People who want to 'hide' batteries just put them in deck.. 

On a side note -  There are some of these small li ion batteries but their capacity is only about 1000mah per cell and im not also sure can someone expect any good power from them unless it is for flashlight.

Dont rember correct name for them.. but they were 10.. something

Could work with some of these cells , these are mostly used on gokarts ive seen.  Thought about using them in builds but theyre more expensive per WH http://www.batteryspace.com/lifepo438120pmsizecell32v10ah100asurgerate32whwith6mscrewterminal-unapproved.aspx

This is 100% Grade A+ bull shit. 

Where is the ESC?

Not to mention, standard longboard trucks become structurally unstable when you remove more than a inch of aluminum off each axle. I doubt a hollow truck would ever withstand the weight of a person.

This "testing" seems super legit...

That's the one thing that actually seems somewhat feasible to me. I would think that the esc and receiver could potentially use the void in the baseplate and maybe thicken up the sides to allow for some cleverly configured components. Also, the truck could act like a heat sink, which you would need if you were running a 4s1p battery system. Unless they're running 2s2p or 1s4p? :laughing:

I think those are just from casting the truck. Will probably get rid off later on. I still don't get why you would sacrifice stability and strength in the truck for the esc which doesn't take space at all...

Well from the picture alone does not look like they gonna fit a lot of batteries in there.. if that pcb is bms.. then it already takes up a lot of space.. not sure why someone has come up with the idea to sacrifice strenght / durability of the only thing that holds wheels in place.. just to make something more aesthetically looking.. 

unless they plan to make huge trucks.. just to claim what they said about everything integrated into the trucks..

They seem to be pretty open about that. So far everything that they got asked they answered in detail and seemingly very thruthfully.
It is refreshing to not see exaggerated specs so I want to believe that that is also true for the range.

base the range on the watt-hours whatever that may be and not claims.    It seems every seller exaggerates range as well as everything else.  they ride with 4 cells.  don't expect much range or power.  that's 1/12 of what I ride with.

I can see this having a niche market as a semi-electric skateboard. Just put it on any mini cruiser or penny board and take it with you on vacation/air travel. But it seems they are marketing it as a regular eboard. 
Anyway, just 5 days left :/ Doesn't look too good. Maybe the youtube gig will hype it a bit.

[/quote]
Where does this 43.6V came from ? 2x2S1P is 4S for me, so around 14.8V nominal.

Edit : Ok, got it ! The forum replaces "4 * 3.6V * 3.5Ah" by "4*3.6V*3.5h" if there isn't spaces between operators.

Woooooow it s amazing, I found only today this new product.
It s sound cool, but how does it works?
How can they controll the motors and everthing with a very small pcb board?
I can t undestand, on my e_boards I have a normal vesc, and it has a size that everybody knows.

Second point, if the truck outside are similar to normal trucks, but inside they have the battery, plus the board, how much can be the tickness?

I really love but im afraid about the hardness.

Just dropping this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLnT4uTcuCY

Seems like they are going through with it. The performance is weak, that's for sure, but that price?

They want almost 2k usd for the trucks with motors, esc's, and batteries, alone... Come on, those esc's cost maybe $10 each for such low voltage and amps.

At best, it's 12v x10a per motor = 120w per motor = 480w total. And with voltage sag, it's more likely 400 watts at full charge. I think 5% hill climb is exaggerating what they can do, none the less 20%? I want what they are smoking!

It's not even about the value of a meepo lol. It's just so over priced for the power output. Most china prebuilt boards blow this out of the water in performance. Worst case, it costs them $500 a set to make, with mold costs and everything factored in over time and they charge $2000.

I wouldn't compare this to a regular esk8 that weighs 11kg / 25 lbs and has a 40km / 25 mile range.

I'd compare this to a downhill longboard.  For what it is, it seems pretty good.

I think the market segment this is targeting is different than the high-performance market.

I missed that topic some how (maybe I was away from the forum at the time). This is the first time I've ever seen this particular one.

I respect that it is something uniqe and I love the innovation. My only grip is the price has crazy markup. People love a good deal (or what they persevere to be at least).

EDIT: take that back, It was the same one now that I look at that thread, lol. Still interesting that they are going through with it.
