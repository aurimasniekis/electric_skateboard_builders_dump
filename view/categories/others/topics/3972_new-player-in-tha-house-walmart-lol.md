Yeah, probably won't be too long before some kid decides to paint it black, and potentially creates a real problem.

Kids should have to kick-Push until they are 12. It builds character!

Stupid Walmart site on Ipad. Convertion $209Aus not including postage. From 2 years ago you could get items shipped to Aus, but now I dont think they do it.  16km/hr. 40 min ride time decent.

Altered has been around longer than Boosted...

A little strange that they haven't made any changes now that I think about it.
