New to the community, yet I'm a Landwheel staff, anything you'd like to know about the Landwheel produtcts, we can discuss here. 

Wish a new category for "Landwheel" in Prebuilt E-boards will come up.

Then why have you not addressed my emails to your manufacturer or company regarding the illegitimacy of several of your product claims in Winter 2015 and Spring 2016 (Range, Speed/Hill Claims, Battery Capacity, and average motor temperature)?

I appreciate that you're on the proverbial e-Board with us, but your product is essentially a clone of the Mellow Board (which has since fallen behind).

Not sure what are you talking about in the first paragraph.

However, Landwheel is distinguished from Mellow from inside out, we're applying for the patents in EU. Let's wait and see.

Sounds fair enough. We'll see.

Mod Packs for e-Boards aren't really DIY or "built" however. Until reviews, modding and teardowns happen, a Landwheel section will probably remain undeveloped.

Let's not get hostile here, forums are places of learning.

If Landwheel had offered some kind of competition for best Landwheel mod or coolest deck + pack combo, we would all be down to get our hands dirty.

With that said, we don't really want to make this e-Board Craiglist (too late), E-Board Alibaba/Aliexpress, or a single companies forum.  It's hard to keep on track which is why we remind ourselves and others about why we commune here.

I'm not hostile at all, if I would like pre-built stuff comercially put into my mouth, I would google it. I'm here to learn the background (electrics, electronics, mechanics) of all that. 
That's why enertion, ollinboards, longhairedboy, torqueboards,...  are here. 
Yes there are commercial companies topics, but not for sales purposes ...

Again,no offense to you as well, I had to check some of your posts just to get your standpoint on this, I'm  no mod, don't have the intention to be, but this is basically a DIY forum. 

This is where you have double-standards cause you couldn't trust something you've built on your own in preference to something that's pre-made and has been proofed and tested.

I see you mentioning an e-go which you don't like cause of the limits. Well, then buy something pre-made DIY. Like a Scarlett or raptor or ollinboard, etc... Sure those won't disappoint you.

(And on top of this, I didn't want to go into this, but this is just a Chinese copy ripping off someone else, I want to see you put all your efforts (read money) in designing something and see it copied)

I think it's good that landwheel staff is here and talking.  It's not very diy but the more of anything related the better in my mind.  What's there to fear?

I'd like to know what they think about mellow board and what distinguishes them!?

The more inclusive this forum the better I think, that is if they're here to be open about what they sell and have the balls to compare

Yizhi can u show us your motors apart and describe the components in detail?

On top of that, He's been a member for quite some time, with zero contribution to this community, slurping up our good ideas to afterwards turn it into this:

I know what Mellow is and you seem a bit ignorant thinking that every company making their own attempt at a drive system is a rip off. But I can clearly sense a pro-western anti-eastern bias here b/c I haven't seen any of you write in such harsh words about Eon.

of course I wouldnt trust anything I build b/c I am clumsy and know nothing about all these components, so I wont even attempt. 

"pre-made DIY" now that's a contradiction by itself. Just b/c Jason puts his boards together in a garage doesnt mean they have a special DIY status. In that sense every factory was DIY.

yea I give you a reason why I dont buy your beloved pre-builds, they are expensive and/or too dangerous for my beginners ass.

I was going to buy your product but after waiting and waiting with excuses all the time I gave up, but I have a few questions that I couldn't get answers to so maybe you can help and other people might be interested. I know you use 7s 15c lipo for a battery but what's the details on your motors?? What is the kv rating on them?? I was interested to see if you could actually get 35kmh like you say it can and before people buy it I would wait till it is actually released, it will save a headache like a few of us were in.

Please link me if u have some good photos.  If it's the same grooves then I'll see if I have prior art rights.  I doubt it's the same though. Exactly the same grooves?
From what I see it's very different in construction and grooves.  It's an extruded metal tube with screws holding it to a plate like so many others and with fewer grooves.
No one wants to make what I'm having made!  Costs too much. It's not extruded tube with bolted end plate but a machined bell.
12x14 is super common and ur that as well

The rated volt of battery is 24, when full charged it becomes 29.4, so we see the 28v as nominal voltage.

The truck of the powertrain is custom made, not compatiable with regular wheels.

Yizhi - Keep it affordable, use REAL specs in marketing and get some real distributors, especially European.

If it only hits 12mph and achieves 6miles, just say it. I am sick to death of Chinese manufacturers constantly lying about performance. They're all shooting themselves in the foot. If you don't start being honest, you're gonna end up with a lot of returns and un-sellable stock. This community is savvy and your product needs to be achieving what you claim. Otherwise, it will get annihilated on here and on reddit's Electric Skateboarding forum.

It would be great to see usage videos. Flat ground with a speedometer. Uphill with proof of hill angle. If you literally cover all bases, you'll be able to shut everyone up so they have nothing negative to say.

Reaches 35km/h - prove it.
Weighs 7kg - prove it.
15km range - prove it.
11.3º climbing - prove it.

Otherwise, you'll be ignored like every other lying Chinese manufacturer.

I was considering the Onan X1 Booster too, but it turns out that the specs on that were hugely inflated. It's unfair that manufacturers do this as it does have a negative effect on honest companies. If you can provide video proof of your product claims, it may well turn into  a 'shut up and take my money' product!

Thank you Kevin for the suggestions, I'm sorry the decent proof of max speed, weighs, range and climbing has been unavailable so far, we have enough reasons to doubt the reliability of the given data. The team is working on it and will release videos recently. But please do not every time put a "lying Chinese manufacturer" tag on us, that's too unfair.

All you need to do is take a 30 minute uninterrupted first person video that shows your 15km range @35km/h, even if you do this on a dead flat circuit with a light weight rider it would still put all the doubts to rest. Plenty of free phone apps that can track total distance and speed, a phone and go pro on suction cups to the front of the board would be pretty good evidence :)  Jumping on a set of scales at the start to show board and rider weight would be awesome aswell haha

How bout a video of it crashing then throw it down the street and get it run over by an suv!?  Looks like thin materials and lots of little screws going through to hold it together 

What size is the stator and how thick are the laminations and what temp can the magnets get to?

Why are people freaking out and being rude I don't understand.

Excuse me I think I'm coming off like a jerk talking badly.  I can't help being cynicsl given the past.  Maybe it's super robust and I look forward to seeing this motor on the street

Power. What size stator is it and how much copper if you know. And the magnets? 

And the bearings?!?!?
Yizhi

And the shaft and housing material? 

Super curious about your motors and hope you come to SF to ride!!!

Now you can ask question so this is clearly a win win for the lurkers who aren't building themselves.

imo it was irresponsible to throw out specs and post shiny 3d models of your product all over Alibaba when your actually in a state where your own team is unsure about these specs and the product just isnt ready.

A couple of days ago this was posted on reddit. A seller on Ebay uk is already offering your product and strangly they claim that the range was 20-25km. How do you respond to this? How is this seller related to you and why does he promote these inflated specs?

Yazhi i feel I came off like a competitive asshole above.  I'm cynical about everything that's for sale in the eskate world!  Everything breaks!  

I'm really curious about your motors and hope can you tell me what the details are and maybe get some good photos

What size bearings and what are the shaft and bearing housing made of?

What size stators? 
What kv?

How does it compare in torque and speed  and noise to something like the vesc and riding 50 or 70 amp limits?  (O no I feel a motor vs battery amp question) 

Are the motors serviceable? With what tools?

I hope to see these motors or board out there somewhere on the street,  are you coming to San Francisco and doing a demo or anything? 

Do u sell just the motors?

Chinese will never answer a question which makes them look bad. [spoiler]NEVER![/spoiler]
so we can just wait for their second batch and hope quality gets better. (which I doubt, because they still won´t test it properly)

[quote="Yizhi, post:1, topic:8285"]
anything you'd like to know about the Landwheel produtcts, we can discuss here. 

Wish a new category for "Landwheel" in Prebuilt E-boards will come up.

FYI, the Landwheel discussion seems to have moved here:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-landwheel-v4-build/25857

Technotron, Mikeopolis and myself (Paul) have made some progress with Landwheel.  Technotron is pretty impressed with all items except for the brakes.

The three of us have put our voices together to influence the brake programming and there is a bit of excitement that something really good is perhaps just around the corner.

Also, more Posting happening here including reports of a 45 KPH run

the new one is an awesome booster   smooth  fast and reliable,  my daily driver.
the only problem is that it cuts out under extreme load and being heavy this happens on hills with me.
i've clocked this thing at 46 kmh on 3 different apps.  It moves trust me.
with two batteries i can get 25 ks and they're light and swappable in 5 seconds.
I have a meepo, a carbon gt, a mellow and this one shits all over all of them for speed. the evolve is not really comparable though as it is batmans skateboard and thats all im going to say about that.
Its my go to board though because it never disconnects (yes my evolve does this) and its seriously fast for a pre built.
well done landwheel for addressing problems and putting out a decent product.

http://www.diyeboard.com/v11-dual-hub-motors-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-p-608.html ich habe vor den vsc auszutauschen gegen den von diyeboard von der Größe würde es reinpassen ob er funktioniert das weiß ich noch nicht aber für ca 100 € würde ich es gerne ausprobieren. Ich habe noch das alte V4 landwheel schneidet bei vollast aus das nervt oder geht mit der Leistung runter. Funktioniert das ?????

Nein; Kaufen Sie keine diyeboard-Sachen, sie sind von geringer Qualität.

Kauf zwei davon, die funktionieren wunderbar mit den Motoren, frag mich einfach wenn was nicht klappt / just buy two of them, they work perfect with the hubs, if you need advise just ask me.
Die DIYEboard Dinger sind ok aber tendieren dazu ohne Vorwarnung kaputtzugehen und die beiden VESCs sind bei 100€ inkl. Porto ähnlich teuer wie ein DIYEboard ESC mit Porto, dafür hast du ein vollwertiges VESC das du ganz nach Belieben konfigurieren kannst. Du brauchst natürlich noch eine fernbedienung aber da gibt es auch viel mehr Auswahl wie bei den China-Dingern. / These ESCs are ok but the tend to not work anymore without warning. Two FSESC 4.12 are the same price as a Diyeboard with shipping and you get a fully configurable thing. Of course you need a remote but with a VESC derivative you have many options.

Ich habe bisher nur die diyeboard Fernbedienung in der alten Version und die flipsky mini remote ebenfalls in der alten version gehabt, letztere leistet bei mir störungsfreie Dienste seit ich sie habe. Vielleicht kann man auch die Landwheel remote benutzen, damit kenne ich mich nicht aus aber sie sieht so aus als ob das funktionieren könnte, musst ein bisschen recherchieren.

I have experience with the old diyeboard remote and the old flipsky (winning) remote which worked without any issues since I switched to FSESC. Maybe you can even use the landwheel remote, at least the pcb for it looks like it could work (external).

Es gibt drei Ausbaustufen von der Landwheel V4 ich habe die C Version dass die die langsam mit der Leistung runter geht wenn es dem Motor zu schwer wird obwohl sich die Motoren kurzeitig stark anfühlen. Die Jungs schätzen die sanfte Bedienung für mich ist sie zu indirekt und schaltet bei vollast ab also indiskutabel.
