Just thought I‚Äôd share. 
I‚Äôd love to try out a onewheel I haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger yet. I think it‚Äôs cool that they‚Äôre releasing a more accessible/affordable version.

Yeah, and I think this smaller "Pint" is a very good option to get the younger kids started as well. Future motion makes America great again.

Nahh...Im saving money for the Onewheel XR.
I got 2 hub motorized boards that I love so much...Im not the belt drive guy. I don't like the boosted mini as well, if I had to choose, I would go for the new boosted stealth. But honestly for that huge amount of money the boosted costs, I would send the money to @eboosted to build me a board.

It's the different kind of ride that makes it intriguing.

I had a OneWheel and didn't like it, but not really because of the ride quality but because of how you get off of it. You have to lift your front heel off the sensor pad and it take a second to turn off. I kept going off balance because of the move and it basically turns off mid turn then tumbles.

The Pint actually has a feature where you can stop, then lean back and it disengages. I'm wondering if that would malfunction when you decided to ride in reverse.

It seems the ‚Äúsimple stop‚Äù is something you have to turn on or off via the app. When it‚Äôs on there‚Äôs no reverse. I could be wrong but that‚Äôs the way I read it.

yeah I'm wondering if you only get one or the other. I never rode switch but the backing up a little was useful. I ride nothing but smooth bike lanes around here, as much as I like the smaller Pint I'll wait until I get to try one before buying one

Me too. At my size I think I‚Äôd get the lower end of the range at that wouldn‚Äôt quite cut it. I really need a long test ride on a onewheel :). The only time I‚Äôve gotten to ride was a plus that had 3000 miles on it at some guys garage sale.

It seems like it has the for the most part the same specs as the xr just small tire and smaller frame and the range of the original onewheel.  The deck does look more plastic looking.

I think whoever gets it is going to be severely dissapointed with the top speed. I have a ninebot which is limited to something like 14mph, and even though I've hit 15/17 for extended periods of time... It's still not enough. 

Such low speeds on a euc/other leaning device leave alot to be desired. Unfortunately it becomes a game of either: "how can I upgrade this?" Or "should buy the next model up?" 

It's just not like an esk8 where I can be content with my topspeed by jamming the trigger my whole ride :confused:

e: holy fuck lmao the range is ONLY 7 MILES BAHAHAHAHAH

no thats no true my friend. The pint just goes up to 7 miles range and XR(Xtended Range) goes up to 15 miles with 20mph. Its a bit faster than the pint
```

The xr will almost never hit 20mph

The most people have hit is 18mph and at that speed the one wheel backs off causing the front to scrape on the ground

Agreed, it's all fun until you get bored.  I never full throttle except for speed test after finalizing a build, but riding "fast" and still having more trigger room is awesome!

I have a Backfire Ranger and at full throttle I might get up to 19mph (22 advertised for people 1/2 my size), it gets so damn boring, plus having AT wheels make it like riding on a mattress.

The wheel on the one wheel just can't keep up

I rarely hold the trottle down, but with trim adjustments and VESC parameters you can totally have a 'jammable' throttle if you wanted to. Thats another caveat of these things.. 

Eh. Someone throw a vesc in it and then we can really start making progress :rofl:

also to comment on the speed.... My ninebot gets almost 10 miles at full speed, and another 3/4miles at the 'crawl of death' speed

7 is just pathetic :man_shrugging:

e: to be clear, my ninebot was also HALF THE PRICE

I know its sort of apples to oranges here but still.........

I borrowed a onewheel XR for about a week, I really loved it but one time I tried to accelerate too hard and the front end went down pulling me with it. Screwed up my hands and waist but it was definitely good fun.

Trust you? I own a onewheel+ and a onewheel+XR and have used it every day except winter here in Sweden.
I love going of road with it and it's perfect for it.
My dog loves it to because I can now keep up with here.
So unless you have one yourself... Noop, you are wrong.

I've ridden one too and there's not that much power in my opinion, what kind of offroading are you talking about?

cause my 800w segway es4 can go off roading too :joy:

Yup. The OneWheel (and other toys) are great as long as you respect it's limitations. The OW is not really meant for "high" speed, at least not the speed that some of us esk8ers tend to reach. The thing was great for leisurely rides. And I'm sure if you use it on a daily basis, it would eventually be second nature like EUCs.

(till i get my 13s10p up and running, then basically no euc can keep up,the fastest euc is the gotway monster 100v,goes 38mph) :grin:

still a euc has a bigger batt and im salty :sob:

That is true, fun rides in the woods, trekking trails and carving in the city. I never had this much fun on the boosted or the evolve (but I only tried the gt).
