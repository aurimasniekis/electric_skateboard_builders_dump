I moved closer to my job so I sold my car and got the wowgo 2s base model. Samsung INR18650-20R. 36v, 4ah, 10s2p battery and dual hub motors. 

Been riding this thing for 2 weeks and haven’t had any problems, it even rained 3-4 days. I have read the whole beginner guide and enjoyed the education.

Nice to meet you all, anything further you guys care to share about the BMS, ESC, battery assembly I’m all ears! Thanks
-Tom
