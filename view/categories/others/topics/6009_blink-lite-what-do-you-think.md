Promo is really bad. Like they just hired someone to commentate over edited footage. Board looks promising though.

That guy shouldn't be doing promos. He should be running for President.

I like the promo, but not the board, check the specs, this is a kids toy, 8km range in slow mode (fast mode is 16 km/h btw.), max 82 kg...

The specs and price appeals to me so they're probably after teens and the college crowd. I don't plan on commuting long distances with mine and am comfortable with a slower speed. I would have gone for a very similar configuration if it was available in the DIY community for this price, but hub motors just aren't that cheap yet and I prefer belts.
