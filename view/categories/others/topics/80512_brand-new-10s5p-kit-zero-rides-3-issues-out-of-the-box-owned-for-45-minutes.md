```
So literally JUST received my 10s5p kit from DIY eboards... and right out of the box i noticed some shit... i payed for the 10s5p kit and 6 x extra belts ( or 3 pair ). Once i opened the  box to inspect everything i noticed i was only given 2 spare belts. KEEP IN MIND, they advertise this product coming with 2 extrra belts in the box. So first issue: missing 6 x spare belts. Secondly, before even turning the board on, I went to tighten some nuts and bolts under the board as everyone had told EVERYONE to do.. 4 of the nuts just spin freely.. not able to loosen, or tighten. 2nd issue:  stripped bolts.  After these two DEMORALIZING issues were spotted.. i was feeling pretty fking bummed out. But alas, i turned the board and remote on to pair them and see how she goes. Turned on no issues than i add some throttle just to try it out ( the board is on my lap). I get some nasty nasty fking noises coming from of the motorized wheels. Major resistance from what seems to be belt rubbing on the wheels pulley ( the one that plugs into the actual wheel), and nasty noises.  i took a couple vids with my phone just to share and get an idea what i should do. I mean... im so bummed boiz.... i waited for evvvvz for some stuff that one, dont work properly, and two, didnt even come in ( AND I PAID)   anyways... pretty rattled. I sent off emails to the diyeboard lads a few min ago, but there is a pretty dirty time difference.. so i guess ill just have to wait. 

Any tips / advice? 

Side note: i DID already check to see if the wheel's nuts were too tight, and they are not. but definetly replacing bearings. these spin for almost 3 seconds and come to slow stop. 

side note 2: i have been longboarding and skateboarding for almost 10 years. Just to clear up any misconceptions about wether or not i have a clue as to what im doing.

Get a refund, 
read and research more on this site,
buy quality parts.

I had terrible experiences with diyeboard too, there is a reason why they are banned from this site. 
For me it turned into, Buy cheap buy twice.

If you fail a claim to get your money back.  They will contact you.  If they offer to replace everything,  do not drop the claim until you have new parts and confirm that they work. 
Not a lot of vendors get themselves kicked off the fourm...... they did

Return it....if they let you.


I'm sure if you ask nice enough, people on this forum could put you together a set that could more or less be a "complete"

It may cost you some more money than the diye kit, but it won't suck or have the potential to burn down your house.


I've just seen so many horror stories with their kits....I'd stay away if you could! If they won't let you return it, we can work together to try and fix your problems in the best way possible.

Thanks Itsmedant. i appreciate the support my dude. I did close to 2 or 3 weeks of research before dropping some mulah. I was concerned at first but the positive vibes outweighed the negative from what i could find (clearly didnt dig enough) I think being so excited and consumed with your first eboard, it gets harder and harder to really find the negatives on something you want pretty badly. I had relativley good responses from jason @ diyeboards throughout the process of ordering. That made me feel good. but now im so rattled. I will without question be looking through these forums for more info. thanks a ton

I totally get it man. I was the same way. I paid for my board in Feb and got it in October. Luckily I haven't had any problems with the board but I get not wanting to change your mind after you are pumped about it.


This site will save you so much money in mistakes, but cost you alot more in "Ooooooooo look at the shiny, I must have"

I'd say do some digging on what it takes to build one. Your money invested in a DIY board feels so much better and you get alot more bang for your buck!

For me the trucks are pretty much the foundation of a skateboard.
So after that failed so catastrophically I have a hard time trusting anything they sell.

But at the same time I know there's more than a few members on here that are running their kits with little problems.... 
But im pretty sure most of them are under 150 and only ride occasionally.

You won't see that problem with a nice set of Surf Rodz trucks and some @psychotiller mounts.

Hell, then you'll be buying a set of 6 shooters from him, and enclosure, a battery.....F it....have him build the whole damn board and never look back. Laugh at all of your friends envy and spite and kick up some dirt in their faces. Be the talk of the town, the bee's knees.

Or.....similar thing.....buy some high quality mechanical parts, scoop some up from the forum used, and slowly put together the board of your dreams. (That's what I've been doing)

You can build a solid board off $30 caliber trucks,  @Boardnamics mounts and some race star 5055 motors.  
Get a flipsky dual vesc and keep the settings low.

Surfrodz are amazing but the price is a big leap from a diyboard kit.

P.s.- building is not difficult and if you have the time, can become pretty fun. I got into it after getting tired of having someone have to fix my problems.

I was more giving @Skunk a hard time than expressing any criticism on the mod. It all goes back to doing the job properly, check everything, check it again, then test.

The failures we see here are sometimes due to one of those steps missed!

Don't mean to rain even more on your parade but those esc's.  I have never had one last longer than 6 months on 10s.  Get your money back and buy a @torqueboards kit.  Bit more money but as they say **you get what you pay for**

Alternatively scour the sell sections and scoop up some used loveliness.  There have been some great builds and parts for sale on here lately.
Good luck man

Don't ever drop your chargeback against them.  They can promise the world but this company has a history of scamming and even releasing people's contact information and credit card numbers on this very forum.

Immediately request a full refund in writing and put an expiration date on the request

"Respond by {date 2 weeks from now} if you want to be involved in the resolution of this claim" is what I would put at the bottom of EVERY communication with them

That way if the date comes you just full-on file chargeback against them without playing games.

Don't accept anything except a full refund.

And please do research before you buy.  Those guys are known scammers.

Yes, however you paid them, you report it as a fraudulent charge, because they did not deliver to you what you ordered.  But first you must try to resolve it.  Just never forget the expiration date on EVERY communication.

Otherwise you get in a spot where they just don't reply and you keep sending them messages and you go over your chargeback window and then you're scammed.

[quote="b264, post:4905, topic:9"]
It’s easy.

Be honest and truthful. Never try to scam. Never give in and let a corporation walk on you. Never try to get more than you legitimately paid for or are owed.

If you’re right and you’ve been screwed, then
A) try to calmly and peacefully yet *firmly* resolve it
B) If a corporation has only robot customer service, or no way to contact, skip to step G immediately without further action. This is their clear way of telling you they don’t want to be involved in the process, and they accept your resolution.
C) never leave it open-ended, ALWAYS end EVERY communication with “response window open until 2019-XX-XX after which you will not be involved in the escalation process” which is typically 2 weeks out
D) Be super polite, but call them on every lie – example:
“Sorry sir, but we cannot do that due to policy”
“That’s a lie, because unless it’s illegal, you can decide to do that – just as you’ve decided to make a policy you could decide to change the policy. Please do not lie to me. Your company can do anything you want so long as it’s legal.”
E) never forget step C
F) Never threaten them – do or do not do, but never threaten to do. Example: never say “I will file a chargeback”
G) File a chargeback against them if they have screwed you and steps A - F have not r

Update!

so this is the fucking email that clown sent me...

Hi Jason

Sorry for the late reply due to my absence recent days for business trips.

I checked your order, nothing missed, we sent you the correct things without missing anything, you ordered the complete board, there's no extra foam pads and extra belts, we have included a T tool as gift.

**a picture of a board and a bunch of spare belts next to it**

if you think there's any problem with the board, you can send us video proof for diagnose and trouble shooting.

Please take a video and upload it to this site and tell us the video address for our check.

[https://streamable.com](https://streamable.com/)

We are sorry for the inconvenience for you making video but it is necessary as our support team only make solution based on valid video proof. Hope you understand it.

You may not familiar with the belt drive board, belt tension is not same for left and right, there's always one tight another bit loose, it is for speed difference to balance the high speed direction turn.

And torlerance is inevitable.

By the way, this board is for **light use only** , typical use like climbing big inclines and long time riding on grass field or bad road will cause much heat and vibration thus may fuse the esc connectors or fry the esc. So don't extreamly typical use it.

end of email

Keep following the steps listes above. 
Inquire about belt tension claim.
Ask about stripped hardware. 
Ask why site says 30% incline and mentions nothing of "light use only"
Keep things civil. 
Be sure to take some screen shots of page so he can't add it later.

Hi Jason T,

Sorry for the problem and trouble, our mistake. We take full responsibility.

Can partial refund accepted by you?

or you can send it back if you don't like it.

i havent ever returned something i bought online so im not sure how that prrocess works.. any light on that?

Hmmm....
Well $100 could buy you proper trucks and @Boardnamics mounts. 
If you want to do a full return I would be sure to find out who's going to cover the shipping first.
And don't send a thing until you have money in the bank.

whatever you do just don't close the PayPal dispute until you have the money from them. another forum member here had an issue with them where they said they will issue a full refund if you close the dispute he closed it and never got the money and once you close a PayPal dispute you cant reopen it.

So Update:

Paypal has replied to me saying i am eligable for refund. Here is the email.

Hello Jason T,

You’re eligible for a refund of $593.20 USD once you return the item(s) associated with this transaction. You must return the item(s) before January 26, 2019. Before you do so, please read our instructions carefully.

To receive your refund, you need to:

1. Return the item(s) to the seller at the address we provide. If you purchased multiple items with this one transaction, you may only be required to return specific items. Please return the specific items listed below as instructed. If no specific items are listed in this email, then all items from this purchase must be returned in order to receive your refund.
2. Provide online shipment tracking information in the Resolution Center before January 26, 2019. The returned merchandise must be in the same condition as when you received it and you are responsible for any costs associated with the return. If the transaction was $750.00 USD or more, we need the seller to sign confirmation of receipt.
3. Mark &quot;Returned Cargo&quot; on the outside of the package to avoid tax charges.

**Return address:**

DIYEBOARD

XinZhou District, Dongshi Street, NanMen Road, Building 7#, Room 4-702 ShangRao city, ?? 334000 C2

**Transaction details:**

* Case number: *****

* Seller's name: DIYEBOARD

* Seller's email: info@diyeboard.com

* Seller's transaction ID: *****

* Transaction date: December 16, 2018

* Transaction amount: $593.20 USD

* Your transaction ID: ****
**Important information about return shipping**

To refund your payment, we need to confirm that the merchandise was delivered to the seller. To do this, you'll need to use a shipping method that provides online tracking information. If the transaction was $750.00 USD or more, we need signature confirmation from the seller. This is an additional service that most shipping companies can provide.

After you've shipped the merchandise, [log in to your PayPal account] and go to the Resolution Center to enter the online tracking information. We suggest you retain a copy of the shipping label to verify the address of the shipping recipient. In some instances you may be required to provide this document to PayPal.

Once we’ve confirmed your seller has received the merchandise, we will issue your refund. The refund should reflect in your PayPal balance within 5 business days. If you paid using a card, the money will be refunded to your card. It can take up to 30 days for the refund to appear on your card statement, depending on your card issuer's timeframes.

Remember, you need to ship the merchandise and provide online tracking information in the Resolution Center before January 26, 2019. You can also cancel this claim at any time in the Resolution Center. If we don’t hear from you before the deadline, the case will be closed and you will not receive your refund.

Sincerely,

PayPal

********************************************

some concerns:

Upon sending the item back with all the required tracking info.. what happens if they receive it... but claim not to have.... I am super skeptical regarding diyboards integrity.

Weird... maybe they are chinese? All i know is make sure to return everything asap lol. I would just make sure your tracking info confirms the delivery of the item to diyeboard once you straighten out wtf the address actually is...maybe have a signature required even if it is under $750!?!?  Im honestly the worst to reply to this because I struggle returning my amazon crap

You could always put Jiangxi instead of the Chinese characters.  The numbers are probably the postal/zip code, so you could forget the question marks.  

As long as you’ve got the tracking info, you should be fine.

specifically who gets what first? i dont want to send the board back and than them just not pay me… should i continue with paypal escalation or another route. anyone got a clue?
[/quote]

They've tried this shit before dont do that, theres a thread here on this forum somewhere where they told them to close the thread and they will return the money. The guy got fucked basically

Assume they are scammers because they are.

I did warn you about this but thats besides the point. Dont close the Paypal claim until you have the money

Edit- I didnt read the rest of the thread
