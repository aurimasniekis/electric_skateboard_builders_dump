It seems kind of hard to call it a review if you are the one selling it... looks good though

Really hard to see why everyone seems to be rallying behind these. What sets them apart from most eboard brands utilizing similar hardware?

This is half the price of usual Chinese boards with better quality. And the owner replies to your concerns. Very clear about all the parts he uses. He's not afraid to tell you there are better parts. But you can't get this price anywhere else.

The review is not from him, but the reviewer for the board for free from him.

I've had mine for a month now and it more than delivers, especially considering the price tag and customer support.
