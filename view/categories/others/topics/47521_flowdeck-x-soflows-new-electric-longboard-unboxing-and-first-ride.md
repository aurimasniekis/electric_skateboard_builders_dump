It looks like you got a bunch of free boards or something and are marketing for these companies?

How can he claim that it's carbon fiber deck. It's probably wood wrapped with glass fiber....

I‚Äôm surprised bud, we‚Äôve done business. 

I‚Äôve not received anything from any skate company. To put it bluntly, I have no need. 

Folks, we have a section here for pre-builds. If you don‚Äôt want new forum members posting links on what the competition is up to - why have it?

Raptor 2, bro :slight_smile: 

It‚Äôs fine, guys  I‚Äôve tried to contribute positivity yet it‚Äôs clear this isn‚Äôt a good fit. Wishing Derek Maseuli well was my first post. Good man. 

Thank you builders for your invaluable advice. You guys truly reignited a love of skating for me. 

To those I‚Äôve bought stuff from (lots of stuff haha) thank you for your honesty. You‚Äôre good people. 

Wishing you all every success and safety in your plans to take esk8 up and to the right. :) 

Sincere regards, 
Karl

I see nothing wrong with posting an unboxing review of a new pre-built in the pre-built category. 
This is the sort of thing that this category is for.
Neither would I call this a spam post.

@topcloud
 Thank you for your contribution. As far as I can tell, you did everything right.

Dude, I understand that you're young, but so many posts of yours are unnecessarily snarky. Dial it back.

Did he specify "the competition" as meaning DIY boards? No. There are TONS of other pre-built boards out there. That is the competition.

I appreciate the upload! I'm a DIY guy myself (love my two boards.. a third is on the way!), but I have a few friends that I've gotten into esk8, but don't have the knowledge/skills/time to do a DIY board, so I'm always looking for new pre-builts that might be good for them.

If you wind up doing a followup video, please post it! I'm curious about the range on a full charge.

its not just him...I asked why we're talking about this here when electric-skateboard.club exisits in another one of the threads about pre-builts.  I honestly think most people are not interested.  I also, honestly, think its a better fit at the Club...hence my question.

I cant think of a single below $500 pre-built board that would last 90% of the people here more than three months.  The quality is low, the completed product is typically problematic, and parts are almost non-existant unless you re-engineer the whole thing.

So lets ease up on calling people out for doing something that 20 other people have done and still havent gotten an answer too.

I was referring this, as well as various other threads where I've seen him go out of his way to simply post snark, rather than answering questions and/or being helpful.

Anyway, in response to what you're talking about, see a couple posts up:

Whether these boards last or not is another topic. I don't find anything wrong with using a section called Prebuilt Esk8 for exactly this. It's not the topcloud's fault that this is here. Whether or not this section should exist, or if this belongs in .club... is not a discussion for this thread.

I disagree, I think this is the perfect place for this topic.  It's the prebuilt category and these are subjects relating to this category.  You are the one who chose to derail the topic instead of approaching someone in PM.  For whatever reason you wanted to call out someone who's helped a metric shit ton of people over the last couple of years.

Nobody is saying you should post relevant info to this category, but having this category is like selling condoms in a fertility clinic :slight_smile:.

If you really want me to "call him out" in a PM, I can do that (just did!). But what he and I said were both directly related to this thread. That is not derailing. Me having to explain this to you is derailing, as it no longer has anything to do with the original post.

Is there a topic in the prebuilt section about why the prebuilt section shouldn't exist? If not, then I think a discussion should be opened up there.

I respect your opinion and I see your point.. I think what I was trying to say was that if this kind of thing might not belong here, then there's nothing @topcloud can do about that. That's something that needs to be taken up with admins.

I'm not disagreeing with that.  I was saying that it wasnt @GrecoMan that derailed the thread by commenting on the prebuild product. I think that was completely applicable to this thread.

of course they do, but freedom of speech doesn't protect anyone from being called out on saying stupid stuff.  I don't know why anyone would come here to sell pre-builts, makes no sense.

I guess my assumption is that the pre-built board section of a builders forum and website would have boards that are "pre-built" but from builders...Like some of the people here do make "pre-built boards" and sell them...and then there's giant companies making completes that are in an entire different demographic...they seem to not communicate or be involved in the community of builders, don't take criticism of their products seriously and they are in the hobby of business not building skateboards...while the demographic here is one of a community with high standards on products and innovation and push each other and hold themselves accountable. They speak through the products and not just their drive to sell them...I think it's fair to point out the difference between companies in and out of the community...they are grossly generalized, yes...but there's a reason why there is a divide...traditional skateboarders have been slow to adopt and be involved with electrics because they see and view this community as one of hipster commuters and consumers of those crappy eskates, the overall image of eskating is highly impacted by the marketing of only a few large companies and not skaters, not the people down here in this forum selling the best stuff and never getting recognition for it...they are use to the skaters running the companies, being the sponsored riders and pushing the industry, not the businessmen behind decks in giant nimble factories.....BUT!! IF!! the traditional skaters get a taste of what this community is all about, it's punk side, it's down to earth integrity, and it's badass innovative skateboards, they would think differently of this entire segment of skateboarding, be more accepting of it and the industry as a whole grows and hypes up increasing everyone's business including the giant companies screwing it all up and failing to understand "the skater"...
