Hey all, I've had a longhairedboy black metal scarlet for a month. Many of you may have seen me posting here, but for those who haven't I have had (or tried out) quite a few E-boards. I was an avid skater prior to E-boarding. About 3 years ago I started doing downhill but transitioned to E-boards. I've had boards such as the boosted dual plus, yuneec E-go, And the enertion raptor. Future plans are for faster and faster builds :slight_smile:

I'll keep my review format consistent, and break it down into categories.  

**Warranty/Customer support:**
The best customer service in the business. I never had to wait more than a day for responses to any questions or concerns.  He has resolved any issue I have had quickly, and answered all questions (and believe me I asked him a lot of things).  The post purchase support is awesome as well.  Got a problem?  Let him know, and if it's an issue that isn't your fault he will send you a shipping label right away to make it right.  He's pretty flexible with other things as well, for example he offered to upgrade my VESC to the 6.0 when that comes out just for the cost of the new VESC.

Update: customer service continues to be amazing, down to him covering round trip shipping and even fixing some scrapes and normal wear/tear on the deck for NO charge.  He replaced my steez remote no charge even though it was my fault for destroying it.  I seriously offered to pay multiple times but he wasn't accepting it.  

**Delivery time** 
My delivery time was approximately 6 weeks due to an issue he had with the first deck.  I would say it will take anywhere from 4-8 weeks for your build.  It seems like lot of it just depends on the specific build and the parts he has to acquire.  

**Quality control/Packaging**
All the nuts and bolts were done well. The wheels were tightened perfectly, usually they're either too loose or too tight.  Belts had the perfect amount of tension.  This board was truly ready to ride!  It came in a box with plenty of protective styrofoam as you can see in my unboxing video.  

**Aesthetics/handling**
Well it's a custom board.  I picked the colors and aesthetics so of course I love it.  You can pick any style of deck and color combination you like.  The deck is extremely stiff, there is no flex at all.  It is a heavy set up weighing in at 21.3 lbs overall.  The enclosure on the bottom is holding up okay for now, but I wonder if it is too thin at the points where the screws are holding it up to the board. I'm glad it has a kick tail, they're beneficial in my opinion.  As with all boards I feel most confident riding this on good quality tarmac.  Compared to the boosted I had, there are a lot more vibrations in this due to the stiff deck, but the stiff deck also feels more stable at higher speeds.  The deck itself is pretty long.  It is longer than my enertion raptor and my boosted board.  

**Performance**
This board is all about high speed thrills!  Measured with the iphone app Strava I have hit a top speed of 38 mph.  Keep checking my video list at the bottom of this review, I'll post an updated video with GPS overlay so you can see how accurate this 38 mph is.  Acceleration is good, but not to the point that you can't stay on the board.  The Enertion Raptor accelerates and brakes much more aggressively.  The gear ratio on this scarlet is optimized for top end speed rather than acceleration.  The brakes are gentle so I usually give myself more time to brake than I would on the boosted or the raptor.  The hill climbing ability is pretty good, it can tackle any hill in my area.  I have to test it on steeper hills that are greater than 20% grade.    I did a test with a moderate hill that is about 15% grade at its steepest, see video below. 

Update: After LHB updated VESC settings and threw more current at the brakes, the brakes are very touchy now... I'm almost scared to brake because they come on strong with the slightest touch of the throttle.  So I've been coasting a bit to let it slow down some and then applying brakes.  This is all VESC settings that you can adjust yourself after you learn to use the BLDC tool.

**Throttle response**
The throttle is actually not very touchy like it is with the raptor or the evolve GT, again that goes back to this being geared for high end speed rather than low end torque.  HOWEVER, there is a point at around 24-27 mph where it just hits a turbo boosted and all of a sudden just takes off.  The first time it happened to me it was scary, but now I'm expecting it so it's actually kind of fun getting a sudden acceleration boost at high speeds.

Update: LHB updated some VESC settings and the acceleration is much better now, it's not as fast as the raptor but I'd say it's on par with the boosted (except this keeps going and going whereas the boosted after 20 mph).

**Battery life/Range**
Range is amazing.  If I'm really pushing this board hard it will still get 16-20 miles.  And for regular old cruising, I can get 20-30 miles with ease.  Charging time is less than 2.5 hours.  

**Reliability**
To be determined.

**Other things I liked so far**
The board coasts pretty well because there isn't much resistance from the belts, much better than the boosted.  I like the fact that I'm the only person who will have this specific board.  The wheelbase of the board is pretty long, so that means stability at high speeds.  The little extras that longhairedboy gives you are a nice touch, for example the t-shirt and a very nice tool kit.  The tool kit will allow you to take the whole board apart if you want to.   I loved how I could watch the board being built step by step on the build thread and on his instagram account.  And of course I love that this is the only ready to ride board delivered to you that can break 30 mph no sweat.

**Things I didn't like**
I think this is a VESC issue which will be resolved, but braking really hard while going down hills at fast speeds causes brake failure.  In fact braking very hard from fast speeds causes the brake to intermittently cut out but then come back.  This will be resolved after the VESC is upgraded supposedly.  The board is big and heavy so it's not the best to carry around, you want to keep this under your feet

Update: I sent my board to LHB to try to fix the brake issue as best as he could.  I got my board back and haven't braked hard while going fast, but brakes are very touchy now.  It brakes hard with the slightest touch of the joystick.  I let it coast now and then mindfully pull the joystick back carefully to apply brakes.  I prefer the settings of the raptor in terms of braking, they feel strong but still linear.  

**Overall thoughts**
I'm satisfied with the board overall.  It is what I use for when I want to go fast!  I'm not sure if I would use it as a slow speed cruiser because it's not very portable or light, but it's nice to know that on open roads you can go 30+ mph.  I wouldn't recommend this board for beginners due to the high speed and risks that come with it.  I wouldn't want some teenager who thinks they are too cool for protective gear to have this board.  For the record I have a full leather race suit I wear if I'm doing max speed runs on this board.  Out of all the boards I've had, my two favorite ones would be the raptor and the LHB.  I'd take the LHB board for top speed thrills or the Raptor for low end torque/acceleration.  

If you want a board customized to your specifications and you don't want to build one yourself, or if you just want the board with the highest top speed outthere, then I highly recommend a build from longhairedboy.

Nice job LHB!

Lot of nice touches and well thought out.

What is the battery pack? 

Are the VESC's going to get overheated without ventilation on longer or harder rides?

If this is the videos your going to do with the Raptor that would be great. Just check your cameras focusing. Id say the Raptor combo should be slightly lighter than the black scarlet. Also will say that the throttle response probably will be more aggressive then how LHB set the vescs up for you. Be interesting to get your comments when you do that comparison video. The Raptor settings can be changed which you will likely do. Having the Scarlet to get use to the power of the Enertion motors will help you when you get the. Raptor.

The Raptors battery meter is handy on the top of the deck, so you can see the level as you ride. Great to see the regenerative braking work. Did the board come with any instructions and warnings. Looks like you are covered with the full face helmet. Make sure you where the other safety gear as well.

Hey this is a quick unboxing video, I put little effort into it really.  Sorry about the focus, I didn't check it even.  Just put the clips together and uploaded it.  Anyhow future videos will be of actual riding so they will be more interesting.  With raptor I'll also do a boring unboxing/first impressions video, then the riding videos will follow.  I may do a comparison video between the two boards.  

The scarlet is heavy, I'm sure the raptor is like 5-6 lbs lighter.  Which is why I'll have the best of both worlds, wood board and a light carbon fiber deck.  The scarlet did not come with any instructions, but LHB gave me plenty of instruction about everything via email.

I put a lot of faith in this board and LHB.  I was hitting up to 34 mph this morning.  If ONE thing goes wrong with any of the electronics or hardware or if the VESC over heats or something... Im toast.  At the speeds I go any unexpected behavior from the board would send me flying.  I'd be in the ER from skin loss, I need to start wearing leathers.  @Mr_Mahal I know what you meant by not wanting to throw on leathers each time you ride now.  It's a pain, specially in the summer.  But I'm gonna have to force myself to do it in case something unexpected happens with the board. 

@CSN you asked about the VESC overheating because of a sealed enclosure without any air flow, my answer is "I hope not!".

Nice run! May I suggest some elbow and knee pads as well. Speed is awesome but even @longhairedboy will tell you that you're playing with fire once your going over 25mph+. I probably sound like Dad these days but just don't want to see anyone get hurt. Be careful out there!

Please don't die. I need all of my customers alive and happy. Also I'd like to build you another one at some point in the future, who knows what kinds of cut out shapes i'll have going on by then. 

Overheating VESCs has not been an issue so far, but i am working on something that would allow me to integrate a lightweight heat sink into the box that can be shared by multiple components such as the BMS and the VESCs. Once i have this company i'm in talks with building my boxes, i'll have more time to experiment with that kind of thing because i won't be spending so much time and energy hand laying fiberglass, which i really kind of hate doing.

@Photorph I'd rather wear something like this that cost about $150 than drop $1500 on leathers

Or jackets with a similar touch that aren't as airy for more abrasion-resistance, but really this combined with some abrasion-resistant pants and some low-profile kneepads is a lot more bang for buck and easier to take on and off than leathers (I would think, I've never owned leathers). Looks badass too :p 

Also, side note: didn't you crash in your dh6? What part took impact? Are you still using the same one?? The hard foam could've been compromised and will probably be less effective if it's taken hard impact once already.

I did, so it turned out it was more scrapes rather than hard impact.  The sides are scraped and the bottom of front chin is scraped and slightly bent, hard to tell in video.  What took most damage was visor and the hardware screws to put those on.  I contacted predator and sent them pics, luckily they sent me a free visor and the screws so those are all new.  Based on pics they saw, they said no need to buy a new one.

Also I already have leathers.  

What you posted is armor meant to be worn under something.  Good impact protection but leathers are better for abrasion.  But having anything is better than nothing.  I think you will need that armor for the raptor, you're more likely to fall on the raptor because acceleration at low end of raptor will be much more vicious.  At full throttle the LHB has the same or even slightly less acceleration than boosted to start, it's when the board gets moving that's when the power hits.  It's like it takes some time for the torque to kick in, that's just how he must have tuned the VESC settings.  It works out good cuz that joystick on the steez remote is sloppy compared to the ring on the boosted remote.  I can imagine having some mishaps while starting from a dead stop on the raptor if there is a lot of torque right when you tap the joystick.

Good to hear it was only light scratches, would suck to have to replace. I'm hesitant to wear mine now until winter because that's when I would be need it the most. 

Yeah I was saying that or something more abrasion resistant like an actual abrasion-resistant jacket/hoodie (ex: http://www.revzilla.com/product/icon-anthem-2-jacket) would be good. Saw plenty of abrasion-resistant jeans.

The raptor is just as tunable as yours. I imagine the only real difference in power is that yours should have more torque / speed potential while not sacrificing range due to the bigger battery / ollin vescs right? If I can learn how to tweak the VESC settings without frying it I will be able to make it more manageable -- current owners have for the most part deviated from stock settings, so it does not have to be a "death trap".

I'd never want the take off to be as slow as Boosted. I'm a very get up and go guy so when I step on that thing I'm ready to fly. I guess most people are just not used to that or don't have the balance. As long as the grip tape is solid and I can tune the remote response to be predictable I believe I can handle the torque.

Ok I rode 15 miles today.  I'm pretty comfortable on the board and I'm comfortable going full throttle, max speed, and doing full hard brakes.  My riding was mostly flats with a couple of very mild rolling hills.  

The next thing I'm wondering is the durability and reliability of the board.  I'll ride 15 miles a day this whole week and see if anything happens.

The whole time I watched that video I was amazed at how fast those trees were going by...that's how I can tell you were going f**** fast lol 

All I could ever think about on my BB was how slow everything was going by when on open roads...cars passing me..cyclists passing me.. Found it funny when you complained about not being able to go top speed because you'd catch up to cars too fast -- something no one on any board has had to say :P 

15 miles on a 12s set up seems a bit odd. Makes me even more curious to test the range on the GT (a 10s set up) as I am aggressive on throttle as well..

Somewhere around 25-30 mph where there is a sudden torque nudge
[/quote]

@Photorph this is a known behavior of BLDC motors; they have a "sweet spot" where at a certain rpm even higher acceleration is achieved; I don't fully understand it but it's got something to do with rpm, kv, and having the right battery for the motor(s) in use. We discussed it in a thread here somewhere, I'll try to find it tomorrow.

```
I use the kick tail at very slow speeds or when I'm standing basically to make sharp turns, or just doing a 180 turn to go the other direction.  If you see onloop's latest vlog with the drone and raptor and how he uses the kicktail, I use it exactly like that.  It's not crucial to have, but it's a lot easier to turn the board 180 without have to bend down and turn it with your hand like i did with the boosted. This board is huge, so there is a lot of real estate on it to move around.

Wanted to do a quick update.

-Charging time: less than 2.5 hours for going from 1 to 100%.  Put in the charger and came back 2.5 hours later and it had a green light.  I don't know how much less than 2.5 hours though, but I'm happy with less than 2.5 hours.  

-Range: I got 16.6 miles last time WITH 10% battery left and that was when I was maxing out the board quite a bit with average speed of 17 mph and hitting 37-38 mph a few times.  This was on flat and smooth Tarmac.  I weigh 140 lbs.  no winds.  Maxing the board drains batteries.  I expect 20+ miles of range while riding at normal speeds.  

-brakes: as long as you brake gently and ahead of time, you're good.  Going full throttle and slamming on the brakes causes failure.  

-future videos: since it's hard to video myself while riding, per recommendations from others I have purchased a POV action cam.  Now just trying to figure out if I should do a chin mount or side mount on my helmet.  Look out for POV videos on my channel "electric longboard" soon.  

Any other test requests or video requests let me know.

I'm really looking forward to this issue being fixed in the upcoming VESC revisions. But braking to hard can also cause face streeting, which is also a known issue that can lead to discomfort.

Oh another thing I forgot to mention, I wish there was like a kick tail guard.  I guess I shouldn't be popping this 22 lb board, but the kick tail is gonna lose it's paint eventually from the bottom.  And I stand the board up on that part as well.  Doesn't effect anything really, just won't looks as pretty as it did when I first got i :frowning:

And here is my first POV style video.  Audio is total shit because my mic isn't here yet.  This was my first time doing a helmet mount and setting up this gopro.  Test was done at cruising speeds, I just wanted to see how the video turns out.  Didn't max out the board.  Better quality POV style vids coming soon.  What do you guys think about the side mount?  That was really my only option on the predator DH6.

RANGE UPDATE:  So today I decided to test range while riding at sane speeds.  I just did normal cruising and riding like almost all of you or most people who buy E-boards would. 

I am stokeddd, I got 23.2 miles...AND there is still 23% battery left.  It was 90-93 degrees out all day today so I could't do anymore and just gave up on trying to get the batter to zero.    @longhairedboy I LOVE THIS BOARD.  Thanks so much man, it's totally worth the price...in fact it's worth more than what I paid.   

More info about this run:
-my weight: 140 lbs
-temperature: ~90 degrees
-terrain: smooth tarmac, bad/rough tarmac with rocks, sidewalks, mostly flats and a few small rolling hills
-23.2 miles from 100% battery to 23% battery
-Average speed of ~12 mph, max speed of 31.5 mph

Evolve GT what??

I also did braking tests.  Braking is very gentle and will never throw you off the board, in my testing when I slammed the brakes going ~20 mph there was no cut out and it came to a stop over a distance predictably.  I'll also say this board is best on good tarmac, on bad Michigan roads you really feel it in you feet.  I wonder how the CF raptor will be...prolly will feel that in my spine on some of the roads I go on.

@Photorph Stop, you're making me jealous! And by stop, I mean keep up the great reviews. I've really enjoyed watching this board get built on the forum, and it's great to see that the performance matches the aesthetics. I also like that you're pushing this thing to its limits to see what it's made of. I don't think too many people would be comfortable pushing 30-35mph for very long, if at all. So, stay safe out there and keep up the great work! :thumbsup:

@Mobutusan  Thanks!  I'm trying to improve my video reviews and tests also.

I just posted a POV braking test and a GoPro selfie video.  I don't really like GoPro video quality much.  And I need to get better editing software.  And I think I'm gonna need to get another person to use my DSLR to film me while I ride.

I don't think I'll be posting every single video here so all of you feel free to subscribe if you want to see LHB board videos, and enertion raptor videos once I get it.

For those who have any interest in longhairedboy boards, I have updated my review to keep my format consistent.  I will also be posting more videos as soon as I get my LHB board back to me. 

For those that don't know, I had to send my board back to longhairedboy because there was a break cutoff issue.  Apparently I shouldn't be bombing down hills at ridiculous speeds and then braking full force while heading into an intersection cuz that causes brake failures because the current generation VESC can't handle all that current bla bla bla.  See LHB's thoughts on it here, he posted a blurb about 190 kv motors and the VESC in this thread in post #170.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/choosing-the-right-motor-kv-for-the-vesc/3125/169

Long story short, when the new VESC is out he will swap it out for me to get rid of that issue but for now I need to behave and not slam on the brakes while going fast.  A

ANYWAYS... once the board is shipped to me upcoming videos with better quality than the current LHB videos I have.  Plans are as follows.

1) Video with GPS overlay using my phone/vidometer to prove top speed is 35+ mph

2) better quality video of me riding the LHB board, with multiple angles

Kevlar fibre jacket - built in elbow shoulder and spine pads.

I removed the shoulder pads and spine protector - elbow pads are inconspicuous.

Haven't had to test it's abrasion resistance properties yet ( touch wood ! )

Guys I just got my LHB scarlet back.  Super excited.  @longhairedboy even touched up all the scrapes so it looks brand new!  I have a new steez remote, let's hope this one lasts.  I've mentioned before the steez remotes are pretty fragile.  He updated VESC settings to get rid of the braking issue, and probably threw more current at the motor for increased performance.

More videos to come on my channel.

I've isolated the fragility of those remotes to some very common switches inside that can be replaced, and as soon as I order a few dozen of them I'll be able to fix those remotes when the switches stop clicking due to extreme impact which typically cracks the back out of the switches for the A and B buttons.

As s proof of concept my son was able to weld the plastic on the back of those switches back together with an old soldering iron and get them clicking again in your remote, but I wasn't going to send that one back to you. 

They still take a streeting much much better than the GT2Bs which shatter if they land right.

Hey all, I wanted to keep this up to date.  For some reason I can't edit the original thread so I wanted to give everyone an update.  

I have since sold this board to fund another LHB build (yes I like LHB that much).  I'll create a new review thread when I get my other one which I predict will be in a few months.  

I also wanted to let everyone know the reliability of the board.  No electronic components on the board have failed, everything has worked great thus far. It needed to be sent in once to get the VESC settings fine tuned (which technically you can do yourself).  Also since I have sold it, the warranty apparently goes to phase 2 and transfers to the new owner which kind of blew my mind.  Very generous of LHB.  The new owner had to send in his board to get one of LHB's upgraded boxes.  As I showed in my video initially I was concerned about the enclosure, and the screws holding it together.  So my prediction was right, unless you are riding in good conditions the box will take major abuse.  The new box enclosures are tougher and will take more abuse from the elements.  Also the new owner wanted to get the brakes toned down as I saw on LHB's instagram, which he is doing for him.  (my brakes were mild, they were tuned up to be touchy, and now they are going back to mild).  All the brake settings are done in the BLDC tool which you can do yourself technically.  So in reality asides from him doing an upgrade of the enclosure this board has been doing well.

I did learn a few things, IF I was gonna get another LHB I would change a few things.  I would get a deck style that allows for bigger wheels w/o wheel bite.  I'm going to want 97mm wheels, after riding on big wheels I found I prefer comfy ride of the original abec 11s.  I would also see if LHB has figured out a better enclosure mounting system.  The steez remote is great as long as it works.  Maybe a modified GT2b would be better.  Drivetrain wise, hub motors may be a good way to go.  I believe LHB works with enertion and since enertion has new hubs out... those may be a good option.
