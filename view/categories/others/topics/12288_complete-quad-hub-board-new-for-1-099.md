[I'm debating buying this](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/acton-blink-most-advanced-eboards-ever--2#/). I want a hub powered board and I'd prefer one that's manufactured with a warranty as opposed to DIY (I have too many projects). 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/7/b73c6ccbe557a7d1a254e9862a54d6206a5591db.jpg" width="421" height="500">

Their specs seem farfetched, but if they're close to what they're claiming, this thing looks like a steal. My experience with every 'kickstarter' campaign is that they take waaaay longer to come to fruition than originally promised, but still..**.$1,099 for a quad hub board with integrated lights and a warranty from a California based company?!?!**

Somebody give me a compelling reason not to jump on this right now ;) Currently only 33 slots left, hasn't changed since last night.

I don't get it why they always have to increase the speed in the videos with fast forward effects to get the impression that the board is faster. Most Kickstarter do that. So I know already that the final product won't be what you expected.

I'm not gonna lie, if I knew about this before i built my DIY board, i would have went with this. It's cheaper than the cost of my entire dual motor setup, and it has good range. Now I'm just secretly hoping this board is gonna suck so I can feel beter about my purchase lol. It does look sick tho.

Seems too good to be true, and probably is.

I wonder if their 30% incline claim is accurate because that is very steep!  Even dual belt drive boards would struggle.  dont know how they can price it so low with 4 motors.  I couldn't even do a dual drive carvon build for that price, maybe a single.  

Has anyone done a 4wd build with @Hummie steel hubs or @LEVer carvons hubs?

This is a Chinese board and these losers are looking to rip everyone off. They're getting on Kickstarter to fund all the purchases from Chinese manufacturers. Haha

You can expect the specs to be over hyped and listed for sure. They have to be making serious cost cuts to meet that price and make a decent profit.

Unless this company has capital and can take a profit hit in order to create buzz and fan loyalty. Lots of companies give away free products for this reason - you take a hit in the short run and hopefully make it back in fold in the long run. 

I'm assuming that Acton either has capital from their previous products, an angel investor, or their employee's are willing to put it all on the line. If not, and they are planning on putting out a cheap product that disappoints everyone that was faithful enough to invest in this early adopter hoax, they'd be shooting themselves in the foot. 

Every new/growing company has to under-promise and over-deliver; if you do the opposite, you have no choice but to fold and reemerge under a different guise.

Just saying, if I were Acton, I'd tell everyone to expect 17lbs, 22 miles, etc. and then wow them with 16lbs and 24 miles. Overnight legion.

I refrain from dumping more than a couple hundred into kickstarters but go for it if you feel good about it! I am confident that my board I'm building for $850 will go further and faster than this and I will enjoy building it. Also remember any kickstarter that involves electronics ships about 1 year after the projected date. If you are lucky :) hahah

Do they actually have a working prototype? All the pictures and videos of the quad board i've seen so far have been renderings. 

On a side note, I wonder if I can buy the board and then strip out some of the electronics and DIY it myself.

Dual diagonal board with sk3's on chain drive. 360 Wh 10s4p battery from DIY Electric. Running on two vescs. And ya I'm almost a year over on a 3D printer. No guarantees but we somehow get sucked into those promising videos right?! haha

I don't foresee Acton keeping the rails of the deck exposed metal rather than grip tape. Seems like if it got slightly wet you could slip really easily. 

There's so much space between the wheels and the nose/tail of the deck in these renderings. It looks like you could fit massive all-terrain wheels or tires without wheel bite. If it's capable of going up 30% with 99mm wheels, I wonder how it would perform with the stock gearing using a beefier tire or an all-terrain wheel and pneumatic tire like the Evolve AT. Seems like you'd still be able to get up some hills.

Just because the product is listed on indiegogo is no guarantee that the product will be delivered. If you want a board buy something that is in production. If you think a indiegogo campaign is worth the risk of getting nothing or getting something that doesn't stack up to what you thought you where buying then go ahead.

Indiegogo is for those who don't mind a bet and understand it's a bet where they could loose it all.

Gladly! 

Battery Pack (includes bms, voltage indicator, charging port, xt90, usb ports, power switch, charger, and cells with everything completely assembled): DIY electric $400
Vescs: Axle $230
Motors: HobbyKing $180
Controller: Amazon $25
Chain: Ebay $8

Total came to $843 (that all included shipping)

Secrets listed below:
I built my own CNC machine that also doubles as a vacuum forming machine and I will be making a custom mold as trade for motor mounts with another eboard enthusiast. I will also be using it to make my own mold for the components under my board. Also the deck, truck and wheels is from a longboard I've had for like 5 years and barely used so that is technically cheating calling it an $850 build :joy: . I will also be milling my own sprockets for the chain to be driven by which is kind of fun because I can quickly design 3 different gear ratios on fusion 360 and have it spit out the CAM (gcode) to cut it out with. Then I can experiment so see what ratio I like the most or even change them out for different rides. I luckily have mucho spare 3/16" aluminum so I can play with that all I'd like. So yes my comment at $850 was kind of misleading in a way but I believe that many people have an least a few things sitting around already that they can use!

Hahaha ya, though used boards are cheap, usually lightly used, and of copious amounts where I live in Utah. Perhaps it's the same where you live?

I was pretty picky about the board i used. Longboards are definitely not cheap but $110 wasnt too bad for the deck I wanted. Could have been worse if i bought a loaded vangurad. But i think everybody on this forum can tell you how we all under estimated the cost of the little things. Connectors, wires, sales tax, shipping, shrink tube, grip tape, bolts, risers, belts, pulleys, tools. eventually it all adds up to the point where you ask yourself, what the f am i doing?

I don't see anyway how they can produce that board they are showing for just under $1100. 
unless they use total rubbish components.

Hahahaha it sure does! I'm glad that instead of pulleys and belts and everything I'm just going to have to make my own. And my schools maker space provides all metric nuts and bolt for free as well as 3D printers, soldering equipment and supplies etc. I'm certainly in a situation that I need to try to do as many projects as possible. Nonetheless my wife has wondered what on earth I'm doing quite a while ago 😂

In a few years, I feel like we will all be riding quad hub motors on decks with integrated batteries.  But we're just not there yet.

This feels like a scam to me.  I'm not going to tell you what to do with your money, but I sure wouldn't invest $1100 **now** to wait 1-2 years for something that might not even come to fruition.  I would rather pay a higher price down the road for a **real**, tested product. Not a video and CAD rendering

I exact sentiment. For them to even be able to sell the boards this cheap gives me the impression they are cutting corners some wheres. Even If I wet super buget with 4x axle VESCs at $83 a piece and hummies hubs at factory prices and a 12s3p (which Is probably close to the size of this battery in Wh's) $450 for the hubs + $332 for VESCs of untested quality (or $750 for the highest quality chaka VESCs) + $350 for the battery + $200 for the deck + $35 for a charger, your looking at $1142 for the absolute cheapest and $1560 for a quad with chaka VESCs, and this is assuming I get everything at factory bulk pricing, like acton is. So at $1100, assuming they are still profiting something, they are cutting costs some wheres. It could be the battery, it could be the ESCs, or it could be the motors...

The other benefit of building your own is with the VESC is FOC, you get rid of that annoying whinny motor sound, and get a nice, quite motor sound instead. You could also ride an actual wood board too instead of this metal/carbon board.

I'm building the v2 quad board of carvon v2s which should be an absolute beast (BTW @LEVer, I'm going to try to remember to get those trucks in the mail today. I keep forgetting, and have been quite busy building decks lately. But if you ever need a dual hollow channel 100% Canadian Maple deck, let me know).

I also am planning a 4wd board with hummies large motors, when ever they finally finish them.

4wd with hummies small motors are great for lighter people (under 150 pounds) who don't want insanely high speeds, the v2 carvons should be a super high speed board, while the hummies large motor board will be perfect for larger guys (like me). I can sacrifice a bit of that extra torque for a higher top speed too, while still gaining more torque than the smaller motors.

I've been working with a friend who graduated a few years ago with a film major, and I'm going to start releasing some videos soon of what this board can really do. I climbed a 12 degree (21% grade) hill yesterday that was over a quarter mile long while still maintaining speeds above 17 mph (unlike the CGT, which slows down to a craw). It's incrediable what you can do with 4wd... I'm just skeptical of what this acton board will be able to do...

Emailed them and this is what they confirmed:

- 1600W CONTINUOUS
- Panasonic 18650 30 cells, 240Wh
- they had 83mm wheels on the prototype and when they went up Lombard St. 
- they said they've delivered 3 products on time and expect to be on time with this one, too. "prototype is done and molds are open"

I'm not sure how it works, but running a quad hub motor must somehow be efficient if they're claiming 22 miles on a 240Wh battery. My 270Wh battery with dual outboard motors (Raptor) usually gets me around 10 miles (170lbs, decent winds, mixed riding conditions, high speed and acceleration). 

Still not sure if it's worth the risk. I feel like I'd rather have a dual hub for around the same price if it could go 30MPH instead of 23MPH. I'm kinda addicted to cruising comfortably in 25MPH zones and not slowing down traffic or having to hug the shoulder where it's all rocky in order to let cars pass.

I don't understand why a company would screw themselves over like that?!

Wheels are gonna be 99mm 78A PU, even though they look kinda like tires in the renderings. 

Still thinking of buying it...my alternative is a Carvon V2.5 dual with 10s3p or 10s4p. Would get me 30+MPH but would still cost more than the QU4TRO. 

Carvon can also do an EMCX with dual motors and extended range for $1,399 and free shipping. Still waiting to hear back from them regarding all the specs on that. I'm not a fan of their enclosures, but the higher top speed and immediate availability is nice. That said, it's about to snow where I am and I'll prob sell my esk8s soon and repurchase once spring comes around lol
