I just preordered this! I just want it to tool around New York. Seems perfect for my situation. But I can't help but think its a Chinese build. I dunno what do you guys think?

Carvon usually makes his own hubs, but that does look like a chinese prebuild, definitely not his dual motors for that price. He is @LEVer here on the forums. Maybe he will chime in.

I know this first hand, He stands behind what he sells with customer service that is unmatched. So, you can feel confident ordering from him.

Interesting. Never work for me, but could be a nice option for someone lighter weight in a flat area. I'd email Jerry at Carvon, I've found him to be very helpful and responsive.

I wrote Jerry and he responded very quickly!

I asked what the capacity of the battery was. And if this was a cheap Chinese prebuilt. 

He wrote:
"The CARVON Emc2 has a battery capacity of 2500mah which equals to a range of more than 10 miles. The controller will be a small thumb controller similar to the ones being sold by Enertion.

These hubs are actually better than our CARVON hubs in terms of power-to-weight ratio. They are also more efficient. These hubs are intended for a complete and light board. Our CARVON hubs have more power, but they are mainly for DIYers, are heavier and will need a bigger battery pack. The Emc2 with dual hub motors is lighter than the original CARVON EMC with a single hub motor. The Emc2 is also cheaper.

After months of searching, we have partnered with a manufacturer from China that we believe produces the best quality E-boards. We are confident that with their resources, combined with our knowledge on hub motors, we can offer a complete hub motors E-board that is both high-quality and affordable. As such, we are offering a six-months guarantee on manufacturing defect. We will repair or replace your Emc2 free of charge within six months. You will just need to cover the cost of shipping it to us."

I'm pretty cool with that! I live in the city where I can't really go that fast anyways. If this thing really does hit 18mph then that will probably be more than enough for me. I was gonna go the DIY way but I felt as though everything would be overkill and expensive for my needs. Even if this is a Chinese prebuilt I'm more than happy to buy this from Carvon.

Nice looking... good work at offering more budget driven option @LEVer. Your Carvons are what I want though!  I think this might be the same company making the Elwing Boards. Nice to see they are upping the game with the dual hubs. The single drive only went 18km. 

See below link for a sneak peek of the dual hub performance. I would imagine Carvons will be very similar.

I have a 2500mAH and just awaiting my CF deck to do a range test. With my weight and location, I'm pretty sure I can hit 10 miles on the right VESC settings. I'm originally from NY like @mikey and can understand how this setup makes a lot of sense navigating through congested areas. Can you elaborate on the real world?

@RunPlayBack do you think a similar build with a  single hub carvon could be good for NYC and weigh in under 10 lbs? I'm looking to use it to get around Brooklyn and take it on the subway to midtown Manhattan. 

Btw it was your videos that got me in this mess (of thinking I need an electric skateboard)

If you're not going to cross any bridges, the little Carvon complete will work just fine. You don't need much speed or torque and the lighter the better if you're going to be lugging it on the subway. 

If you're going over the Williamsburg, consider that the uphill climb is going to drain your battery quick, so think more like 6-7 miles to a charge. Also, the 70mm wheels are not going to go over expansion joints as easily as 90mm's. 

If you live near the Williamsburg, I recommend just taking the bridge over and going up the Hudson River Parkway to Midtown. It's a nice ride and you don't have to deal with cars for most of it.

Yup what @Mrmoonlight said. You're gonna want a stealthy minicruiser for the subway. I have a good friend who wants me to build him a board and his commute is from Greenpoint to 57th and 8th so my thinking is definitely a minicruiser. Depending on your battery and deck, a single Carvon could be around 10-12lbs. My single Carvon on a 29" Jet Spud + 10s Space Cell hovers around 15lbs which is heavy but still compact to take on a train or bus. I'm experimenting with a 12s1p LiFePO4 on FOC with the Carvon Single on a 30" carbon fiber deck and I think that might hit the sweet spot for weight and portability.

44.4v @ 5a is 222 watt hours, 36v @ 2.5a is just 90 watt hours, which doesnt make sense that they'll get more range. if the reduced weight of the mini board really makes that big of a difference, I'm gonna shit my pants when my 12s 8.4a 21" 18mph board is up and running. If they can get 10 miles out of 90 watt hours with an 18mph top speed, I should be getting around 40 miles weighing just 70kg. come onnnn chaka vesc! Can't come soon enough!

I've clocked 12 miles with 12s/5ah more than once with dual motors/belt drive. 
Belt drive does tend to get better mileage than hubs.

I had to cancel my order :-( 
I've weighed 180lbs for most of my adult life. But I recently weighed myself (first time in like 6 years) and I now weigh 190lbs.

So I had to cancel it because I'm FAT!

I ordered a the dual hubs after talking to Jerry. He was SUPER helpful and recommended I just get the dual v2 carvons.

I guess I will also try to lose some weight.

Yes you should, I wouldn't say that the blink board is bad but the blink I have broke down after two weeks.
The support is good though so they are sending new parts.
I believe the emc2 is going to be better.

So I have played around with the board a little more now.
I bought it from CarvOn to get the support if needed but I know that it is the same board that is called e-wheelin if bought on other places.
I have to say that the owner had great patience with me and all the questions I had, and I mean a LOT of questions!
Both the board and controller has a great build and looks great to.
Battery is actually better then I thought.
First charge took around 1 hour and 50 minutes but after I depleted the battery a few times and charged it up fully it took about 1 hour and 30 minutes for a full charge.
Where I live we got many hills and that gives me around 6km before its empty.
When I'm on flat ground I get around 9km.
But! I have only tried the rabbit mode so maybe I would get more mileage from the turtle mode. 
The thing I worry about is the motors. If the street is just a little uneven or if there is gravel due to the roads here in sweden isn't perfect at all, the wheels are getting some pretty horrible vibrations that can't be good for the motors! That's one of the things I like better with a belt driven board.
I'm really impressed by the motors though, they take my weight of 67kg up most hills and don't even get hot.
The max speed for me has been 24 km/h and that is plenty enough.
The acceleration and breaking is night and day from the belt driven board from Acton that I owned before this, this one is smooth.
I took a ride in the city today and got some creepy interferings so that I sometimes couldn't break and sometimes lost control of the acceleration. That's pretty common what I've heard but still very annoying and dangerous.
At my neighborhood I only found one place that gives me the same problem and it always seems to happen on the same spot every time,  It just loose the connection. I guess there is something in the ground that is more commonly found in the city. My guesses is a power cable.
I noticed that one of the front wheels didn't work as good as the other so I took it apart to change the bearings and I simply can not understand why they put a truck like that on it! The quality is awful and I badly need to install a new truck for the front wheels.
The part where the bearing and wheels are screwed on to the truck (can't find the word for it)  are to thick and messed up so that they lock up the bearings and I had to use a hammer to get the old of and the new bearing on. If you look at the pictures it looks like they had to machine it down (they are very uneven)  to get the bearings on there.
That's a little worrying because that locks up the bearing and what damage did they do to the metal while doing it?
Other skateboarders and longboarders who tried it and looked at it share my thoughts that it feels like a solid board with great power in the motors.
The charger that comes with it is small enough to come with me anywhere.
This is simply a really fun board and I'm hoping that it will hold up.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/d/9d6109903986100e9ce253434f7be4f1c1314c75.JPG" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/4/f4a5f793b80a3cdab97cf0808f91343597b7cb3a.JPG" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/e/8e56df7a597c65be3edc53ec3cacabb2222aad28.JPG" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/8/f87581de26ae96577bb4de4c2569aee386978ee0.JPG" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/f/aff38582cbf9784dd20f350dd9a9443acae9fb57.JPG" width="690" height="388">

Hey guys, I just saw this post and have a few questions regarding Carvon! I live in Toronto and need something to get around the city pretty quick as opposed to taking the subway/bus everywhere, especially when traffic hits. I've been looking into building my own board for a bit, but I just don't have the time right now. Do you guys suggest getting the EMC2 or E-Cruiser Drop-through? Thanks!

Okeeeey so my Emc2 is still working but... 
Just an hour ago I sat down on the bus on my way home. 
I started playing with the hub motor wheels as I was reading on my kindle. 
I noticed that one of the wheels are hardly moving when I'm trying to spin it around, while the other moves almost freely. 
I can feel that there is something wrong with the motor and it sounds like something scraping on the inside. 
I really liked this board a lot and now it's already broken  😥

Got the mail, it feels like a problem with the motor. When I try to turn it with my hands with power off I feel it scraping on the inside. 
But let's keep the conversation going through mail instead. 
I'll get back to this forum as soon as we know more. 
This is unlucky, I really like this board.

Another question to anyone here, the controller that comes with the Emc2 is really good and it has a switch to go in reverse. 
Really funny to see me when I thought I would go forward and a my daughter had switched it to reverse 😂
But when do you need a reverse on a skateboard? Is anyone actually using that and when?

here is an update
This is the mail I've sent to Carvon.
So i got the new Emc2 a month ago and have been waiting for the weather to turn from rain to sun.
Today the streets are clean and dry after the winter and its really sunny so i took the board out for its first run.
It took 10-15 minutes and suddenly it felt like it lost connection to the remote but when i stopped and lifted it up both wheels hardly turned.
I turned it of and on again but now the power switch doesn't light up and everything is dead.
Now im really sick and tired of this and would love to send both boards back and get a refund.
Last sumer i got only two weeks with that board and now i get 10 minutes, this doesn't seem to be a good board in any way.
