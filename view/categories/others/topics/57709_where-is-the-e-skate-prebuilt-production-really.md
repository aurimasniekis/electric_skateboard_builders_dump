Hi everybody.
I was  searcing on the web, the most famous e board on the market now, and in sequence we have, Evole, Boosted board, Inboard, Blink, Meepo , Lou, Slick revolution exc...
All with  beautiful website, all with cool photos, but in every case, you never see the factory production.
I was a baker of Lou board on kickstarter, because in the video the young guy said, we are Swiss and this is Lou, but finally it was a 100% chinese product.

So my question is:
is there a factory that produce them in USA or EUROPE, or in any case they come from China?
I see on my bamboo gt, made in China on the package :-(  
so what do you think?

If it needs service, shipping is cheap and fast and the personnel are very good at communication

I think you will always be scarfing with pre-buildt, not saying they are bad boards but doing the research and building your own is very rewarding and you can always change your design for riding preference and tuning purposes. I like taking things apart and learning how they work and eSK8 is one of the best options to learn about motors, drives, batteries, electronics ect... I know it is not for everyone but when you roll your own you end up knowing so much  more about whats under your feet doing 30mph. This community has such a strong commitment to helping the beginner to the most advanced enthusiasts I am so glad I did my DIY.
