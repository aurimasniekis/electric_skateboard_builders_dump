Looking at the first two boards, if you get the ones that use SLA (sealed lead acid) batteries, I think you you will be disappointed. SLA batteries are heavy and not very powerful (at least compared to the weight). They sell a LiFePO4 version which I think would be much better. I frankly don't think you'll even be able to get to the speeds they advertise if you get the SLA powered version.

As to the one on aliexpress, I am solidly against any chinese pre-builts, so I'd say run. I know that's not what you wanted to hear, but they almost always cut corners on the batteries and the ESC at the very least (which are frankly the most important, and most expensive, parts) and often the motors as well.

"Cheap" and "all terrain electric skateboard" are frankly opposites. I would not expect to spend below 1200-1500 for a halfway decent all terrain board. A good one will easily run you 2000+

These specs are for the Li-ion battery.   They aren't going to post realistic specs for lead acid because it will behave like a child's ride'on toy.
