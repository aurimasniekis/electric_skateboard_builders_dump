So I came across this board the other day while on offer up and I thought I should make a post about it. Its around 5 feet long, 1.5 feet wide, 2 feet tall, and weighs a whopping 90 pounds. The guy who owns it uses a crane to get it in his truck.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/c/4cfd6ee67d517c27b3a7fa2438e70fcc1d2c6fea.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/2/a2f041861545c1f5e0ce7adf005b49bd3974387f.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/f/7f2fc006fc6494c1c78f1c139e0360c5a38adfa0.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/3/33a03f5152c47544c19ef4a25545d6233fa783cc.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/b/bb9c90a69fc35c6614c65b526f193ea1b325156e.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Otherwise - nice big wheels, even if axles look super tiny on these wheels.

reminds me of the first electric skateboard I saw at a Sport Chalet in the early 2000s when I was in college riding a "Go Motorboard" electric scooter

A maverix border cross. First electric skateboard (?) I bought. It's like 80 pounds and clunky as can be <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/4/64876e53792b768adb0d2a64577cd8add753d3ed.JPG" width="375" height="499">
