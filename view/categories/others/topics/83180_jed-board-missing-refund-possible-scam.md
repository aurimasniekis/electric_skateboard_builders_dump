But maybe the mod could keep a close eye on this... in case it goes off the rail.

You rarely hear about vendor praising but second one thing doesn‚Äôt happen people start coming out of the wood work.

Atleast we got the boa wheels out of them.

The reason vendor bashing is typically a problem is because the whole truth is rarely told and you rarely hear both sides of the story before things divulge into a Witch Hunt.

*not saying this is the case with you or anything like that.

This shouldn‚Äôt be considered vendor bashing. It‚Äôs valuable. He‚Äôs potentially warning others before they too fall victim. 

Jed boards is a scam. They‚Äôve been ‚Äúpre-selling‚Äù for over 2 years. No one will actually see a jed board, they‚Äôre unicorns.

In all seriousness....is this your issue or something you found on reddit?

I feel like if we just post a bunch of bad gas from vendors as seen on reddit....we should just become reddit.

If a user on this forum has an issue with a vendor, we have rules and avenues to get things resolved.

I get trying to warn people about possible scams, but at this point, unless it is YOUR issue, its just cluttering the DIY forum

He knows he dun goofed but he fact of the matter is that this guys been involved in previous scams and i think people should be aware of this. he's literally stolen $2560 from him at this point, promising a refund and after that, conveniently not replying to his messages. hmmm seems pretty sus to me!

He has literally been hawking that thing for ages with no result.  I have a local here that put his money into it after meeting Jed and yet to receive.  I met this guy at a carpark while waiting for my son to finish rugby training.  I was flying round the area on my carbon build and he asked me where I got it.  I told him I built it and he asked me who I was.  Evolve or enertion or someone new.  I said just a builder mate.  He was like what?  You can do that?  That was 18 months ago and I'm damn sure he still hasn't got his Jedboard because he hit me up on face book asking for a build.  Shame on you Jed.  Fuck these guys for taking advantage of the industry in its infancy.  @Purewinter  Matt good on you for opening this thread and don't be scared of the no vendor bashing rule, its there to stop the forum getting filled up with complaints regarding late deliveries and such.  General mail order issues that all vendors suffer from.  Genuine problems regarding scamming bastards should be aired and its good for the community in general.  Trust me on this if you had crossed any line with this thread then @treenutter would have let you know.  Hes our collective conscience

Continuing the discussion from [Jed Board Missing Refund - Possible scam](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/jed-board-missing-refund-possible-scam/83180/22):

It's now eight months since I was promised a refund from Jedboards. The same email pattern repeated over and over...never get past the sending of remittance. Jeremy (in particular) appears to forget he's send the same lies over and over...it would be truly hilarious if he didn't owe me ¬£1k. I have the proof also. My comments on Instagram always deleted within minutes and my account now blocked.

I find Esk8 business difficult.
Boards that used to look advanced are becoming less attractive with the times.
The speed to finish and sell is also important.
Boards with their own battery packs and drive systems make business more complex and delayed.
And Esk8 has fewer users. Electric scooters will be much more in demand.
I don't know the correct answer for Esk8 business. It seems difficult to make a big profit.

Has everyone received their pre orders is what I'm referring to and you well know it.  Wheels make you money and where did the money come from to fund the Boas?  I'm sure all the people still waiting for their now very late completes would also like to know.  

I'm just getting a bit sick and tired of unfulfilled crowd funded ventures taking advantage of our community and my friend you are one of those people.  

Be transparent here.  You have the chance.

Boa was funded out of pocket and not with pre-orders. The money came from me personally. Jed Boards was also personally funded by myself. I have invested considerable money into both businesses.

We have had delays with manufacturing and run into many issues, we have detailed the issues along the way by means of social media, blogs and other channels to keep customers in the loop. At no time have we set out to take advantage of anyone, full stop. Majority of the parts used in our boards are not off the shelf and had to be designed and engineered from scratch.

We are still a small yet growing company, our communication may not always be perfect, but we're learning from any mistakes of the past and improving as best we can.

Pre orders are being fulfilled at the moment and customers will be getting boards.

So why did you (allegedly) ban folks from your social media accounts when they asked for refunds? Process refund requests in a timely manner and you won‚Äôt have threads like this to answer to. You collected the full amount on the pretext that production has started... more than a year ago. If you don‚Äôt need the preorder money it makes no sense to hold on to your customers money. You should refund everybody until their boards are shipped.

See a little dichotomy?

However you crowdfund.  Its still taking money before you have a product and with that kind of funding you have a moral responsibility to uphold your end of the bargain.

The only right thing you can do is to get refunds the people that you are due asap. 

Also the 'right thing' to do would have been normal business practice of getting money from the bank to create your product not crowdfunding or kickstarter bullshit where the customer will take the hit for you. When you fuck it up or just keep their money is easier than you owing the bank so its win win for you whatever happens. I still kinda struggle to understand why people will spend so much money in these sort of transactions tho.

Dude not even their ambassadors have boards yet. There is ZERO social media from customers. In fact if you got through weechat, Instagram, Facebook, etc you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs the same 6 or 7 boards also 
If they were shipping it would be big news. There would be a photo. Someone in the world would have taken a picture of one by now and uploaded it. 

Apparently they sponsored an event and didn‚Äôt rock up or pay the money for it. Terrible business practice. 

I don‚Äôt understand why they are not more forthcoming or why they can‚Äôt refund the initial deposits. 

Such a shame that the innovative ideas they had 3 years ago have all been beaten to market already. 

I‚Äôm worried by the time this board is released USB-C will be outdated.

Jeremy, I just watched your last interview...i don't know what to say really...You certainly talk too much....about what's good for the industry, products being fit for purpose with safety being a priority...you can't fall off a non existant skateboard i guess. You talk about others stepping up their game when your game is what exactly? is Jedboards a scam? There aren't any boards in the hands of those people who backed your company. Deposits and pre orders remain unpaid. When are you going to come clean? You've sent me so many emails promising repayment each time you go quiet, nothing happens, no transaction is ever made. How are you ever going to sell this product if everyone thinks you are a shyster?

```
The latest to happen: they supposedly began board delivery to customers in asia but a radio software bug was "discovered a critical radio bug that potentially results in a total loss of throttle control". So they grounded all shipments and won't resume until the radio bug is fixed. I posted on their Instagram post asking if we're being delayed by another set of 3 months but they said it shouldn't be anywhere near that long. However in the last few days they've disabled comments on the Instagram so now none of the customers concerns over this latest delay can be seen. If any customers in asia that discovered the bug come forward showing the board I would rest alot easier but currently it's still a little fishy. Unless of course these early board receivers are friends of the company or perhaps connected in some way which is what keeps them from coming forward with a preview/review.

Friends of Jed need to buy him beer and help him come clean.   His lies could not last forever.  I think he took all the money and spent it all on alcohol and women in Asia.

Jeremy, I just watched your last interview‚Ä¶i don‚Äôt know what to say really‚Ä¶You certainly talk too much‚Ä¶about what‚Äôs good for the industry, products being fit for purpose with safety being a priority‚Ä¶you can‚Äôt fall off a non existant skateboard i guess. You talk about others stepping up their game when your game is what exactly? is Jedboards a scam? There aren‚Äôt any boards in the hands of those people who backed your company. Deposits and pre orders remain unpaid. When are you going to come clean? You‚Äôve sent me so many emails promising repayment each time you go quiet, nothing happens, no transaction is ever made. How are you ever going to sell this product if everyone thinks you are a shyster?

Long time ago since they solved the last issue. Nothing happened since. What's the current state? I guess no one received a Jed so far?

They "shipped" to customers in HK but were "pulled back" and now they are "fully boxed up" but awaiting "upgrades" for the last few weeks.
