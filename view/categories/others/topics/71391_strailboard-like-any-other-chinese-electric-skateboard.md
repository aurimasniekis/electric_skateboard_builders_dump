In Paypal's buyer protection it says they **do not** cover when purchasing "motorized vehicles". I contacted them and they **do** cover smaller vehicles and smaller motorized vehicles such as bicycles, segboards, uniwheels, **ELECTRIC SKATEBOARDS** etc. They **do not** cover cars, motorcycles, trucks etc.

I contacted Paypal in Denmark, but it might be diffrent from country to country (i don't think it is.)

**Conclusion of my talk with paypal:**
If you don't receive your product you can get your money back. Not sure if you can get your money back if the product is just shitty quality.

@sk8l8r
Their certifications is bullshit.

Some more bullshit.

The board has nothing to do with the "Looking to build first board" thread.
I know it's a DIY forum but people might come to this forum if they are looking for a premade board. I also think it's a great boad if it turns out it is the exact same as the wowgo.

But after looking a bit more into it, it looks like a bad copy of wowgo and ownboard.

Photoshopped the wowgo logo away?

I don't **know** how Strailboard can sell the board so cheap but I **think** this is how they do. They order directly from [this site](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Cheap-hub-motor-smooth-ESC-longboard_60770507372.html?spm=a2700.7724838.2017115.1.6e943622OtUqkb) and make it ship directly to the customer. $1 profit :joy:

If im correct Strailboard (and any other chinese factory) pay about $145 excl. shipping per unit with Samsung 6AH battery (if they order more than 1000 units).

They raised the price to $400... not that good of a deal anymore. I would personally buy the wowgo mini instead. They got good reputation and their boards have been tested.

Dang, ur on top of checking that site. Strailboard sent me a couple of response emails and then a fed ex tracking number in Thursday for a 20lb package traveling from Hawthorne,Ca to Bay Area where I love. Since Thursday to today, the scheduled delivery is still pending package drop off.

I'm a tad concerned that I won't get a board but when I went to paypal to start a claim, it gave me their PayPal email and number and a message saying reach out before you claim please.

I googled the email and it took me to an electric unicycle forum saying this email/company did indeed deliver e-vehicles as promised. 

I send another email and am awaiting response or update on tracking info. 

:frowning:

Just chill out if they have you a tracking number they are almost definitely sending you something, board or not that’s impossible to know

Me being a tad concerned is pretty chill. I'm curious how/why it's being shipped out of Hawthorne,ca and not China. You'd think if they had a warehouse/distributor in CA, they could get packages out in a reasonable manor. 

We'll have to wait and see!

@legend27

she's arrived. first impressions. hella small. nice smooth acceleration/deceleration curve. kinda quick. charging her up for a full test ride as i type! thinkin about a deck swap. :smiley:

will open up battery case and see what battery is in there. super curious. i'll be amazed if i can go 30km as promised.

239 shipped. pretty impressed. too bad they made it 399 now.![IMG_0592|666x500](upload://38hS7Tluj3ZOr6dnBqX2v8Y5BIC.jpeg) ![IMG_0593-1|666x500](upload://qH8Q5aMaic0adSHgL3osB7WrYIU.jpeg) ![IMG_0594-1|500x500](upload://aei37CExjqBWSDmxyiTa27Gokp1.jpeg)

There is also another 240 dollar board on AliExpress. I believe it’s called maxfind or something

Cool board! for $240.. Not worth the $160 extra if you ask me. Plastic enclosures and not from a popular brand. We don't know how the battery is made. But hey! GZ on the board!

I can have a guess that the battery will be one of those 22p cell batteries for hover boards. All of the Chinese boards are the same, I would expect it perform the same as a meepo or wowgo board

Yeah but for 240 dollar it is very affordable. If it performs like the meepo or wowgo im guessing it will be enough for most people.

It will perform like a meepo/ wowgo the parts are identical, only difference might be esc firmware

Looks like the rc7 remote on the diy site vs the wowgo/boosted “clone”.

Looks like the perfect , throw in your trunk everywhere board.

I got my Strailboard V2 a month ago, just in time for my 2 week vacation at Wasaga Beach. 

The shipping was pretty good, 3 weeks... nothing to assemble and arrived with decent charge on batteries.

After approximately 35 years off boarding, I was able to get her purring around the parking lot with very little embarrassment and tons of smiles - my cheeks hurt after the first ride!

I've only put a handful of charges on the board, but I'm ready to say it's worth every penny...  I might need to move south when winter arrives.
