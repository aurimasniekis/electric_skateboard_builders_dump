The Mrs wants a midsize little kicktail type grocery getter.  Considering the Evolve Stoke,  Riptide R1's or a Boosted Mini (though that might be too short).

Any one better than the next or go with the cheapest?!  Or better suggestion?

Ownboard KT, or Meepo campus?  Iâ€™d honestly recommend the Build Kit Boards one

Do you have one Z?  Same price as the Boosted right now but sounds pretty good.  Building would be fun as long as I don't screw it up.  And love that it can allow for the squishy wheels unlike the Boosted.

Nah, too poor... already have a fifth board in the works ðŸ˜….  I really wanted one with a drophammer deck or something so I looked into it and it's 100% the best price to quality ratio you can get 

Maybe I'll sell off my weaker boards and get it in a year...but now is definitely the time to buy
