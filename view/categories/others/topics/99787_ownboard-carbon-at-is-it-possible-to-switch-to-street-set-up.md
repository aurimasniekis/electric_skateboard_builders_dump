Recently got Carbon AT and i think the board is compatible with street setup. Has anyone tried to switch AT wheels to regular street wheels ? If yes, what belts ,pulleys and wheels are compatible?

Wheels would be whatever pulleys you decide to pick (abec/kegel cored). Use a belt calculator to figure out the belt length depending on the gearing you decide to go with.

You'd also have to check the diameter of the axle the current wheel pulley sits on- iirc the ownboard w2 has several different diameters on the axle. And also maybe check the gearing ratio on the current setup so you can match/find something similar with the smaller diameter wheels.
