Hey guys,

I had a problem with my Ownboard, it suddenly stopped working so I contacted Ownboard and they said it was a BMS problem, they sent me a new one and I changed it, it was actually not that easy but it's doable since it worked for me, I know that some people had the same issue so if you want to know my experience with the replacment I made a video about it where I also review the board, do two range tests and tell what I think of the board :

The BMS issue is at 1:55

I know it's not really a tutorial but there are still a few pictures and some informations that may help you. If you have any question feel free to ask ! I'll be more reactive on YouTube
