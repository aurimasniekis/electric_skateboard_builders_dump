I've been searching a lot and finding that there are a lot of people buying chinese boards and wanting to upgrade them. I thought we couuld use a thread where poeple shared what parts they used and how they upgraded it. Maybe some of the pro DIY guys can give advice on what parts to buy and where to buy them. Please share any repairs or upgrades you've made to a chinese board. And i know people on here hate the chinese clones, but let's try to make this thread about building and repairing.  Not about slamming people for buying a chinese board. Please. Lol

Hmm, nobody documented anything in almost 2 years time after this thread got started ?! Anyways, here is my contribution, it started with my friend got one for his son after learning that i got one & he got his even cheaper online for about USD90 delivered ! After close to a month, it broke down, doesn't power up however when the charger is plug-in, it works fine. This is expected since it was damn cheap, he knows that i previously mod ebikes & asked for my help. i told him most likely its just one of the cell is faulty.

This is how it looks like dismantled, replaced with a recycle Sony US18650GR 2.1AH green cell. it was soldered back to the pack.

A close up shot of the BMS

![IMG_20180916_122003|666x500](upload://xrYzgctmr1vFBTRPRarVcdYTXHq.jpg)
To identify the faulty cell, measure each of the cell directly with a multimeter, you will have to desoldering the RED circle area then the whole BMS can be move freely. Or at the BMS, measure the RED circle area to B1, B1 to B2 so on & so forth, it should having about 3.7 Volt.

![IMG_20180916_122008|666x500](upload://yi30AC1rSHxvPNTt8rpkJvGAgt5.jpg)
The BMS measures zero volt between B5 & B6 meaning most likely it is dead. i've tried a quick reviving technique but still it won't hold charge. To know more about the quick reviving technique then refer to the below youtube videos.

Found some info on the other side of the battery. its a [2000mAh](https://phongdiy.com/product/pin-18650-3-7v-2000mah) capacity 

![IMG_20180916_122053|666x500](upload://tA9WHK1Q8uM8uiuU8A7Mf5sQgBM.jpg)
This is the latest controller that doesn't require powering up. Just lay the skateboard on the ground, give it a push & it will auto power up !

![IMG_20180916_124234|666x500](upload://tXwCtVUwN1s8XR8vNArLxZkiBM.jpg)
Everything installed back to the case.

![IMG_20180916_124653|666x500](upload://aLhXc8H2NjNwpiNm82GyaXvFA1H.jpg)
Yeoh man, you got the seal wrongly installed or is this the correct way, anyways, this is how it was when i dismantled it so i'll just reinstall it back the same way.

![IMG_20180916_125036|666x500](upload://7HqScoifBAeWGXWdssvG4e7xAwz.jpg)
Everything up & running.

![IMG_20180916_125101|666x500](upload://tdadkYeHi31421M3WuSn9yfgXtO.jpg)
it kinda look nicer with the screw being on the outside.

![IMG_20180916_125113|666x500](upload://pKyqupNIwXWPLCqNtUcsOBYdkwM.jpg)
The technique i use is to press & feel the screw on the grip tape sand paper. When you found it, use a pen knife, cut it a little bit where the middle of the screw is. After that, opening it with a Philips screw driver will be alot easier.

![HD%206S%207S|666x500](upload://aF6zLrcdjPbB8BH4SnkLuD56wRf.JPG)
HD capture of the controller, it is the same generic controller meaning it can be upgraded to 10S. Can you spot where is 6S & 7S ?

> **10S upgrade**

**WARNING !** 
Speed kills, this is no joke, Always Wear A Helmet, perhaps it is also a good idea to wear full body Skateboarding Protective Gear & even a full face helmet if you intend to go top speed with it !

Upgraded mine to 10S awhile ago & the acceleration is a huge different ! Got all the parts but took the longest time scouting for the enclosure to house the 3 extra cell. 

![4x1_holderV2_preview_featured|480x224](upload://1yIUg9UKUf86FEIuALx5KxTFBde.jpg)
Found a [4 cell holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:820139) but the 3D printing alone costs USD25 ! 

You'll fall in love with your toys, you wanna use the top grade parts & it'll end up costing more than the board itself so don't fall in love with it. :laughing: At the end, i use cheapo for my 10S upgrade, everything cost about USD25 & that is the same price for just the 3D printing only !

![inside%20case|690x494](upload://jaWCKSR0V1SRYQlCGerMpIsdzYS.jpg)
i end up using this cheapo waterproof camping case, cost me about USD1 only !

![long%20board|690x480](upload://eIlbbUEHQtPrV938tAq47EHCRoT.jpg)
If you are already using  this longboard then there are plenty of spaces for the extra batteries.

![cheap%2018650|320x500](upload://iWT8JM08fRBZvV9WH4j5Lgh78Dn.jpg)
You'll need a total of 10 cells, extra 3 cells as existing is already 7 cells, cost me a total of USD5 for 3 cell. This cheapo 18650 works fine on flat & will starts beeping on hill climbing.

![cheap%2010S%20BMS|660x500](upload://5aUo1ELB0H4HTDuIxZlHDqhusho.jpg)
You'll need a 10S BMS to properly charge all the 10 cells, cost me about USD9.

![BMS%20wiring|422x500](upload://iwn0nmrxM73WnRpGvz3a2jTesmc.jpg)
This cheapo 10S BMS is not able to supply the intended amperage so the P- is not connected,. The cons here is that it won't cut off when the battery is too low so you gotta make sure not to over discharge it or most of your cells will go bad very soon !

![cheap%2042V%20charger|690x445](upload://3ONZr0Y6410LWghtanW2zTBI3aO.jpg)
You'll need a 10S charger, cost me about USD10.

![my%20controller%20HD|690x447](upload://q23Yj0UKFUCbn2XLGiwtAWBsGcL.JPG)
HD photo, you'll need to remove the zero ohm smd resistor both at 6S or 7S if exists.

> **13S upgrade**

[details="Click here for details"]
![IMG_20180917_125625|666x500](upload://hd47A80SqKpcg4kGnJMgV4u9IAq.jpg)
Why 13S & not 12S you asked, parts required are more or less the same except for the price differences on 12S & 13S is hugh ! 13S BMS are mass produce for ebikes/ escooters thats why they are cheap. Overvolting 36V to 48V on ebikes is an easy job & it works the same for this V1.3 board. And the case fits 6 extra cell just nice. :sunglasses: ( existing 7 + 6 = 13S )

![13S%20mod|647x500](upload://aUiB6Lk6E7QveOkiAzHG60DLMfe.jpeg) 
All you have to do is replace the existing 1M ohm smd resistor with the unused 1.2M ohm resistor from besides the label 6S. Soldering & desoldering on smd is quite tricky so refer to the below youtube videos for details or you might spoil your board so be careful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JM4oCpWnjU
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW9aEkToX8w&feature=youtu.be&t=90

![2%20mod|647x500](upload://tCmcZpLQbhTzBzysbZkfaxQtXV2.jpeg) 
If you have the latest V3.2 like my friend then you need to add a 470 ohm 1 or 2 watt resistor or higher to lowered down the input voltage to 7815 at the back of the PCB. RED round circle is the built-in 200 ohm 1/4 watt resistor in parallel so total its 50 ohm 1 watt. 7815 has a maximum voltage of 40 Volts, i did measure existing stock 7S battery pack is 29 Volt & the input at 7815 is 27 Volts meaning the on board resistor doesn't really do its job. You'll need to trial & error as i didn't try it on my friend's board. 

![7815|666x500](upload://4EMJZ8dsWIuTWTXlq6m7kOroHMG.jpeg) 
Fyi, 13S charger charging voltage is 54.6 Volt so make sure that the 7815 is not over voltage at its input. The easiest way to add the resistor is lift the 7815 input on the right then solder the resistor to it & the other end of the resistor directly to the PCB.

The other upgrades you'll require is the 13S BMS, 13S Li-ion Charger & 6 additional 18650 for this mod.

Enjoy your upgrades, Think Safety First, Always !

May be its a new manufacturing technique to prevent vibration as normally these mosfets are mounted with screws & nuts. There seems to be copper on the mosfet side of the heat sink but they are not shorted ( common drain ) without mica sheet & bush

Or replace existing with 21700 aka Tesla battery, fits 6 cell nicely. Or even 26650 but i have not test whether it will fit as i don't have any 26650 cell

**16S Upgrade**
Upgrade mosfet to [FDP2532](http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/FDB2532_F085-D.PDF) or [IRFB4115](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/irfb4115pbf.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a401535615ba6a1e0f)

Also did a custom repair on that chinese "small fish plate board". Found this website just now but couldn't find anything on the ESC that's in mine. It's labelled Reintech RT-60D (single motor version). I tried to overvolt just for fun at on point, and wired on my 14S4P eBike battery which was at 52.7V.... Motor spinned crazy fast but ESC started beeping (probably to warn from higher voltage)... Did not try under load.

Question, when you upgraded from 7S to 10S ? How was your topspeed ???  On 7S, I top out at 16 km/h, so I imagine top speed would be 22-22 km/h on 10S, and even 29 km/h on 13S. The HB3GL-A motor is 37.5 Kv in reality (not the 110 kV advertised).

My battery quitted on me after a month. One cell died. So instead of using generic chinese 18650, I used some high power cells (Sony VTC4 and LG-chem HD2C) scavenged from good dyson vacuum battery pack (BMS were faulty but cells were good !). Made a 7S2P pack with twice the capacity. Transplanted BMS and made a custom wood gasket (made waterproof by epoxy coating) so the battery box could accomodate more cells without having to create an entirely new battery box. Initially posted some pics on the Endless-sphere:

Will try to upload a bit more pictures than the ones already on the endless-sphere for you guy who are curious about this board.

Thanks Banjaaxed The lights were not stock though. Got them Koowheel lights on eBay 20 bucks for the set of 4. Only prob is the holding metal brackets tend to snap due to vibrations. Lost on light and retreived a secobd one due to this. In the end i removed them. Will have to find time one day to deseign a more solid bracket. BTW, if your on off switch craps out, i found a much better quality one with the exact same dimensions (original momentary switch not the chinese clone). If you need to buy a replacement like I did, the link is in the endeless sphere thread. I also explained how to reverse direction on a hall sensored motor in this ES thread, as my board was always in reverse mode when powered on... I changed it... Got 200 km on this board now...

Seldom hangout here nowadays, got an email notification regarding [banjaxxed post today](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/chinese-board-repair-and-upgrade-help-so-you-bought-a-chinese-board-huh-wanna-talk-about-it/10607/12?u=yuweng)  then only i realize your post was here earlier :sweat_smile: Nice detail post at Endless-Sphere :+1:

With 10S as you said, it was about 20Km/h but easily wobble at those speed & the wheel will heat up very fast ! Fyi, i got it working up to 20S but on load, it'll fried those mosfets even though i've upgraded to 150 Volts mosfets, i guess those 3 phase motor PWM went crazy with 84 Volts, i lost counts of how many times i've repair it :laughing: On these single hub motor esk8, 13S or 16S won't increase much top speed but the torque is crazy, you'll need to get some use to it, my advice is better to stay at 10S :sunglasses:

Just in case anyone wants to dis-solder faulty mosfets, you'll need this type of [PTC heater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H16kdM7mJ8s) or it won't come off, got it quite cheap online.

Your board Reintech RT-60D is the same as those generic Chinese esk8, just dis-solder the link/ zero ohm resistor at the PCB label 6S & 7S then your board will become 10S. Reintech is the same company as [Microworks](https://microworks.en.alibaba.com/company_profile.html?spm=a2700.icbuShop.88.27.4c8f3f16QIf7Eq), recently bought a 30Km/h EUC motherboard from them, they use to be an R&D board manufacturer but last few years venture into manufacturing & selling esk8 directly.

Thanks Yuweng ! 20S is absolutely crazy !!!  You swapped the mosfet !!! I'm in awe seeing how ingenious people like you can be. BTW I'm guessing it would be a good idea to also upgrade the capacitors to higher voltage ones.On the Reintech they are rated 63V (up to 15S !!), but on the cheaper eBay ESC, the caps are typically only rated 50V (max 11S).

I love the small fish plate electric skateboard, It's a good entry level board for a very very good price so as long as people are a bit handy, It can be repaired easily. My initially had lots of problems, but only because of very minor and easily fixed failures that most people would not even think to inquire about.  For example I had to resolder the wires of the switch (they broke with vibrations and left me stranded with no power), had to hot glue one of the small capacitor (false contact with vibrations) and I had to swap the momentary switch providing power to  the ESC because It would not work anymore after being exposed to slight/moderate moisture and light dirt. This new R6BBLKBLKFF switch looks exactly the same as the chinese generic cloned swithc (KCD1-110 (On)-Off momentary version) but the genuine R6BBLKBLKFF switch gave me no problem whatsoever : https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=R6BBLKBLKFF   ( this is the "momentary" (On) Off  version, carefull not to buy the  classic rocker switch, which stays is On position after release). My battery also died after around 50 cycles (relatively shallow ones: 100% to 40% on average). So I build this one double the capacity... much much more reliable and long lived!

I'm must say that one day one I upgraded the bearing for Zealous steel ones because the stock one had a lot of friction resistance (would spin one revolution!).

I'm planning to eventually upgrade to 10S. I have an additionnal 6 Sony VTC4 cells (2100 mAh,30A, 23 mOhms DCIR) so I will make a seperate "3S2P Booster battery pack" with it's own balancing BMS to wire in series with the 7S2P pack I have on... But maybe I will change my mind altoughter and just rebuild a battery with 10S2P and a 10S BMS instead. But I do like the low profile original small battery box... Thanks for all the info on the Reintech / Microworks ESC.. I litterally spend days trying to find a replacement spare Reintech ESC (in case I blow up the original ESC by overvolting it too much!!). I could not find it anywhere (tried eBay, Amazon, Bangood, Aliexpress, Alibaba... Even though I don't speak or write mandarin or cantonese, I even tried taobao and 1688.com, using google translante....).... I found some text on the dual hub version of this ESC and tried to seach for it (used a online chinese caracter recognition website, drawing each stroke of the caracters....).. Came up with this from one picture, I saw some chinese text I was able to translate myself: 
![s-l16002|500x500](upload://5JvaEZb6yYfwgZ8RsrXLfAZWOBL.jpeg)

ShenZen Technology Dual Drive Remote Control skateboard controller

Model No : RT-60C3

Input voltage : DC24-36V

Matching Motor: Fǎlā dí

So I searched the web for a single hub ESC with similar chinese caracters:
"深圳 瑞 引 科技 单 驱 遥控 滑板 控制器" and some other combinations of characters.
No luck.
I could not find any spare replacement controller that could fit in the original battery box. The original Reintech RT-60D V 1.1  ESC has dimensions of 55 x 75 mm... The original battery box has a compartiment for ESC which can accomodate an ESC with maximal dimensions of 77 x 75 mm.  But no ESC on the market is small enough to fit. Except the Reintech RT-60D i think.

I did find an interesting ESC that I could pair up with an upgraded RC6 type Remote... Here: https://detail.1688.com/offer/572856146064.html?spm=a261b.2187593.0.0.25201e4dD7m2B2
But it seems like it's only available in china. This one is not currently available on the market for some reason... at least not the single hub version.... Tough to find stuff for this board, but I love it, the size and weight makes it very practicle even for the slow speed, but I would be more than happy with 20 km/h...!
The replacement ESC tah would fit and that has the RC6 remote would be this one:![ESC|690x305](upload://kpTNJinQ4ZpiLlmf5JLUuZtMYWr.jpeg)

I also looked up the motor. Was able to buy a spare on eBay for around 50 USD... The PU sleeve is starting to get quite beaten up. Also bought a replacement set of trucks (exactly as the original) in case it breaks (cheap metal cast ?), I will have replacement to mount the motor on.

i started off with ebikes, like you, move on to esk8 & nowadays, modding EUCs, its never ending :joy:, i actually learned alot of stuff from endless-sphere's long time user _**fechter**_, my ebikes was running 84Volts SLA battery back then, got a top speed of 70Km/h until the whole axle & mounting screw got spin out as i was not using any torque arm, luckily i didn't got injured, good times during those good old days :laughing: Still using my ebikes on & off nowadays :sunglasses: In case you are interested... 
but that will be at another forum

Back to your case, AFAIK, Reintech/ Microworks only sell to OEMs nowadays, use to see alot of their boards on taobao/ 1688/ ebay but suddenly everything went missing/ disappear. You can actually use any generic boards, it should fit into these generic fish plate. The Reintech or any generic controller is actually quite robust, you don't need to buy any spare if you're not modding it. i did order [my spare](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=568123518745) but never really got to use it. ( Warning : it won't work on 10S on default, you gotta do some micro-soldering on it then only it'll work & those step down resistors are hot on 10S ! )

As for these single hub motor, these fish plate uses the cheapest of all but again, they are quite robust ! A trick i found to keep the PU from aging is soak a damp cloth around it for awhile after use & it'll be like new ! i guess these PU needs water :grin:

Having said that, DO NOT USE IT IN THE RAIN or run it on any water surface, the internal of the hub motor WILL RUST even though they said its water resistant ! My friend's wheel got rusting so bad inside it after a week of not using that it wouldn't even spin.  When i open it up, there are still tons of water inside but anything is repairable :sunglasses:

These fish plate spare parts are actually very cheap on taobao or for that matter of fact, everything is cheap there but sending it to the West is a problem, you'll need to use [taobao agent](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+is+Taobao+Agent).

Thanks for the update. Good to see some solid RPM measurment. I did not have a tachymeter and based my calculation on speed and on some RPM figures on alibaba.
As per your measurment, this motor doesn't have a Kv of 110 RPM/V as advertised on alibaba... With my figures I calculated around 37.5 RPM/V,  But as your tachymeter shows in reality, in free air, it's more like 75 RPM/V ?

I received the new spare hub motor. Same central stator, but rotor can acommodate replaceble PU. 75 mm PU sleeve. Just can't find additionnal replacement 75 mm PU sleeve  anywhere on alibaba or elsewhere. At the same time I serviced my OEM hub motor. Not much rust in my case. But the rubber o-ring was destroyed. So I put a new one (it's 13mm  OD, 10 mm ID and 1.5 mm cross-section). I also ordered new screws for the hub motor cap, because they are easy to strip... They are 6 x 10 mm M3-0.5 screws with PH1 Philips flat head.

Previously, i've been looking for these fish plate replacement hub too but couldn't find one that offers replaceable PU, so i didn't order, AFAIK, only 83mm & 90mm has. do snap some photos & share it here.

i donno if you're refering to the back of the hub motor, i've change mine to SS allen screw for easy tightening instead of tightening with a screw driver :sunglasses:

This is 75.0 mm external diameter.
Could not find the replacement sleeves for this one. But obviously they exist, since they are removable. Let me know if you ever find some pu sleeves. I'd probably have better luck finding it if i could read some Chinese...

yuweng, Do you know what kind of antenna wire the ESC needs ? My remote only works for 3-8 feet... well more like 3 feets reliably. I would like to increase signal range between ESC and remote.
I noticed picture on the internet of the Dual hub Reintech ESC can accept an antenna wire... Do you happen to know wich kind ? I think it must be a 2.4 GHz right ?

2.4 GHz IPEX wire ?

Help!??

Ok, new to this website, so hopefully I'm posting this right. Last summer I decided to buy one of those cheaper "Small Fish Plate" E-Boards, and I went through a lot of hassles to get it. Debating on brands, very delayed shipping, very bad customer service, etc. It didn't take long for it to break down, from outside modifications until it completely conked out. The questionable company didn't reply despite many attempts at contact, so I took a chance and opened up myself. Luckily, I managed to bring it back to life, but it is still very finicky. So I'm opting to first fix and then upgrade it, rather than waste the inflated price I paid. 

The main problem right now is seemingly whenever I hit a bump (like continuing to hit the sidewalk impressions after awhile), the (ECU presumably) beeps 2 -3 times and the board disables itself, but remains on. I don't want to have that happen when I need the brakes on a hill. Yikes. After that, maybe upgrade the battery or make it swap-able on the go (The latter I already have plans for.) The rest like the motor power and such I can think about later. Any ideas or help would be immensely appreciated. Thanks.

Hello Everyone, I have a genesis tomahawk/Koolwheel electric board.The battery just died on me. Did some research to get a replacement, but it is about $180. Is there a way i can just upgrade the battery to something with more power and top speed with its current hub motors? I dont mind spending a bit more to do it. 

Thank you!

The speed.and "power" is not only limited by the battery,, but also the ESC.

You may see range and hill climbing performance improvements (less voltage sag).

 got some other questions aswell:
- will the batterie led status be destroyed or have to be changed or just show its allways full when the mod is finished?
- got a hub motor (150w) in it, can i change to a 350w 70mm motor or will it draw too much amps, not sure about the specification of the esc
