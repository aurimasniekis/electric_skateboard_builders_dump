Continuing the discussion from [Another Clone from the land of dragons](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/another-clone-from-the-land-of-dragons/1605/6):

Just for any interested, I just took delivery of this eboard from China while waiting on another build.  Have not taken it through its paces yet but don't feel ripped off yet either <g> lol 

For @psychotiller @lowGuido @delta_19 @longhairedboy @jacobbloy @LEVer who either posted on this or are helping my next build!
