Just found this board, what is your opinion on it?
the flexy battery pack looks cool.
I wonder what is the advantage of crowdfunding from the business strategy perspective.

You get all of your investment capital up-front, and you don't have to work as hard to get it. You really just need to make one great prototype and then share it.

It is 1200 Watts each, so 2400 in total for the dual. But only for a short peak, but that should be enough for the most people who don't need the most powerful board. Of course not for the members of this forum. But for 599 $ for the early bird it is a good deal. The Battery has 166 Wh which should be good for 17 km in average. 
But what i don't like is that they advertise their 7 S Battery with 29,4 V (4,2 * 7). Correct would be 25,2V.
And the wheels are 85A. I think that is too hard for e-boards.

@Hillso In these cases (kickstarter/indiegogo) my fear is that the manufactured version won't be as good as the prototype. There are a LOT of small production mistakes that can lead to poor quality. You have to wonder if the person who developed the prototype is capable of leading a large-scale manufacturing effort. Is that person able to assure consistent quality all the way through the manufacturing process (when said person has never done it before)? 

Building a great esk8 in your garage with 3D printed parts is really different than leading large-scale manufacturing efforts. So when you buy into something like this, realize that it's a gamble.

I think you get your money back in kickstarter, unlike indiegogo, if the product fails. But of course, the quality of the board will also be a gamble.

if you can find a 15km section that is all downhill maybe? or without the rider? lol

my new board is 8s 10ah lipo ~350whr and I can only get 20km....maybe 28 if stay under 12mph..but anyone who can do that on a board that goes 25+ doesn't deserve to ride it :joy:

I'm liking the deck design  and flexible silicone  battery box :thumbsup:......I would personally prefer a flexi deck due too my knee issues.

IP44 water resistence rating is also another plus point and video shows it coping with light off road and gravel.

Video shows extensive durability testing :+1:

Reckon a good entry level board......Any more info on the controller and esc?

Keeping my eye on this they currently have 47 backers $26k raised so far.

The main thing putting me off the Raptor 2.0 is the stiff board and enclosure....and 6 month wait.

Ticks a few boxes for me as an entry level board and I'm thinking the deck and flexible battery enclosure is quite innovative albeit the hardware is all basic belt driven.

Level of testing they have put into this is good (they are also applying for ce marking)

https://youtu.be/XDh3S481IbU

I'm getting quick response to questions from the owner the board is tested and ready for ship in December and customs included.

Am intersted in the single motor setup as no hills where i live and i'm only 75kg. Think the 7s battery will cope well for me They confirm motor size as  5065...i will get an answer on kv.

So talk me out of this one :slight_smile:

Those wheels look like unbranded Evolve GT wheels! I'm wondering on the longevity of the battery tabs when they're constantly bending. If they had a machine test to bend/unbend continuously over 'x' days I'd feel more comfortable getting one; that is, if I ever bought a commercial board :P

that test video above does show the board being put through its paces...though not know how long they ran those tests. I guess some flexability is a good thing as a stiff board with no flex is more prone to vibration and things coming loose....note a few raptor owners on here with battery / wiring  issues. Nice to see they are at least putting through a test bench.

There is no clone. I-wonder is the manufacturer for both of these companies and with a 5k budget you can create a custom enclosure and call it your own. :) 
However Buffalo has an odd history and or lack of and shady marketing by trying to sell the buffalo enclosure in a second marketing attempt on indiegogo under Motion Boards brand. So that's all i can say for that.

I expect the board to be decent for the money but nothing to scream about.

Too much flex for my taste. They took the flex thing to much forward. The boards shape looks funny, is almost like a toy. Like a chinese toy (which It is) too much plastic. The logo, which is ugly, wont help to the overall image either. In aviation they have a saying for aircraft design: "If is beautiful It will fly good."

Funny you said that, considering the B-2 is not only the first stealth intercontinental bomber, but also the first stealth tetra engine aircraft, still the only one in existence after more than 3 decades since the advent of stealth technogy, a flying wing, with fly-by-wire (your computers) and on top of that, almost 30 years in service (since 1988)... so not only is a beautiful plane (striking) but the most advanced aircraft ever designed, devilish accurate, the most expensive aircraft ever built, tested in battle and the most lethal bomber ever. You bet this astonishing beautiful aircraft flies (computers or not) like Aladins carpet, hell yeah!!

So I got a new motor, but the wiring is different colors.

[Old Motor wires](https://ibb.co/gaYSQ0)

[NEW Motor wires](https://ibb.co/jiNRJL)

Does anyone know how these colors correspond to each other?

Thank you in advance.

It shouldn't really matter how you connect them up.... Except that some combinations will result in the motor spinning in the wrong direction. Just play around with the combos until both motors spin in desired way.

99% sure I'm right with this. Someone will correct me if not 😁

UPDATE : 
I hooked up the replacement motor  [( the one with these wires )](https://ibb.co/jiNRJL)
in multiple combinations, for trial and error.

I get nothing, no forward spin, even if I give it a hand spin, the motor does not kick in. However, it does brake when I push the controller lever in the down position, so I know there is power getting to it.

The old motor has a sensor, the new motor is sensorless. Could this be the problem?
