Ummmm **_WHAT?_**... Video claims $799 USD 45Km/h
Anyone heard about this/can confirm?

I love that they keep coming up with new stuff. Handles are definitely a raptor rip-off. So what is the real advantage of AWD - he mentions braking in the video, but is that worth the added $$?

Well, I can't speak from experience but it'll be less intensive on the electronics as a whole I'm sure. Less amp pull per motor/esc, less sag etc. Raptor rip off maybe but for half the price idc

I dont know about this, it is too heavy. 4 motor is not necessary but they can get away with more motor less amp I guess. I don't understand why they don't put more voltage on motor. 12s will easily solve this issue

The esc is probably caped at 10s

45 km/h 4 motors It just sounds Like great fun, But a bit unpractical.

I understand that they gone far to update esc multiple times already and building 4wd.
I guess it could be a good selling point but anything more than 20~25lb is no go for me...

Same wattage at higher voltage - more efficient.

How can the handles be a rip-off? Don't be funny, anyone can design this handles. It's just the smartest placeto put them in.

OK, then why didn't all the prior Meepo boards have them there? Be honest, tell me you didn't look at those an immediately think "Raptor 2"?

Whats your source for higher voltage at the same wattage is more efficient?

Because Meepo Always had different style handles. They probably saw that having a different design is better optimally , especially since they always had a few issues with ensuring that the handle distributes the weight like it should. 

But calling it a rip off really isn't fair to technology as a whole. If there's a solution to an issue, and one person reaches a conclusion first, is everyone else that also reach that conclusion a ripoff? No. Just as DIYElectricSkateboard's incoming DD isn't a rip off of Carvons, Meepo's aren't a rip off the Raptor 2. The Raptor 2 shouldn't have a monopoly of symmetrical handles...

Many years in electric RC aircraft where all of this was debated, hashed, data logged, etc. ad neaseum.

less loss due to resistive losses.

So . . . maybe.  It depends whether they did their own R&D only to reach the same conclusion or whether they took a short-cut and said, "yeah, that looks cool, let's do that".

Knowing how things are most-often done overseas in that regard, I fell fairly comfortable speculating. I'm not knocking meepo specifically. They seem to put out a nice product. It's just a different culture there with regard to copying product designs and features.

whether the handles are a copy of the Raptor 2 or not, it doesn't change the fact that they are both hideous. To me, the Raptor is the worst looking board you can buy off the shelf (well actually put an order in a couple of years in advance....) and the handles are a large part of why it looks so bad.

Yeah it's all in the beholders eye, but my eyes behold a board that fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down.

Just as well it's fast, so it will always be a blur when I am near one...

I don't know about the handles sticking out.   Some time when I ride my eskateboard i like to push start and there where times I would kick the rear wheels if the rear wheels sticks out too much.    I can imagin me kicking the handles.   That could be painful.   But with 4x wheels drive ppl don't have to push start.

You’ve never had to push to start on a hub motor board. Im 200lbs and one dual motor meepo gets me up hills and up to 25 mph no prob on a 10s5p

I didn't even checked the video before i responded to you because as soon as you called it a rip-off i knew that enertion isn't doing anything ground-breaking in esk8 industry.(exlexcluding a well tweaked VESC) 
As i already said, Meepo just took the best solution to the problem. I don't know if they looked at Raptor or not but it was either way the best solution if you want to implement the handles.
Would it be a Raptor rip-off if Boosted went with hubs? Yeah...

So if their 2wd setup advertises 25mph or 40ish kmh would and extra set of hubs at the same specs get the board to the 45kph of would the hubs have different specs? 

I was thinking of doing an awd conversion for shits n giggles as I have a couple meepo ecs laying around... One 250w hub is seized so id need to find a replacemnt there.... But when that hub siezed I ended up upgrading to 500w x 2 from diye... 

Hmmmm

I don't think it can reach 45Km/h the motor are still the same. I use the diyeboard one with 2 vescs and I just reach 40km/h not more. It feel like I reach the max erpm so it won't go faster at 10s. For sure 4wd will increase torque.

Ok, so here is the deal with all wheel drive.  They wont go at any higher top speed then dual motors but you will get there extremely fast.  I think the Meepo GT may actually have a chance at beating the Raptor 2  but not in top speed. I kept asking them to sell me a all wheel drive kit.  nice

Turns out the unit was with someone else so I met up with him to test it out. Long story short I was a little disappointed. There was a huge amount of low end torque, but the highest mode was jerky as hell. The mid and high end torque was good, but not nearly as good as a 2wd raptor 2. That’s probably due to the small batteries used. The deck was probably the best thing about it, great concave, drop through, really stable. Trucks were pretty good as well. 

I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone unless you’re living in a crazy hilly area due to the jerkiness of the controls.

Thank you for the quick response.  It is about half the price of the raptor, but I guess it is their first generation and it looks like they still need to work things out to make it slightly comparable :-).
