Cheap ass, chinesium rebranded board. Costs 250 in parts to the manufacturer :face_with_raised_eyebrow:
Don't throw money at it, save it and build a kick ass DIY

Makes me want to go on a crazy rant everytime I see this bullshit.  This is our masterpiece etc etc.
No mate its not.  You got it off alie express and chucked some crappy grip on it with your lame ass logo.

Pedestrian, at best. 60mm motors, 10s battery (likely 25r), diyeaboard wheels and hubs.  I wouldn't pay north of 700 for it.

And thats you being very nice Sir.
It fires me up because a good friend just stocked his skate shop with similar crap that he now can't get rid of instead of coming to me first.  Firm called Urban, marketing that shit for 1700 aus.  Should be a law against it.
