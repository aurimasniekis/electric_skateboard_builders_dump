I decided to update this topic b/c I'm getting more and more excited about this board that I ordered from Aliexpress. The shy guys from China paid a visit to this forum the other day and I would want them to give us some more info on their board with dual hubs with impressive stats.

Here you can find some videos of the board amongst the other electric vehicles they are selling (just ignore the hoverboard stuff)
https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/koowheel/

I was very sceptical that they could have this performance and range out of a 4.4AH, but maybe the low-wattage motors do the trick here. Battery is swapable as you can see in the pics.

If you want info on how the Chinese imports hold up, check the others category. Also, knowing that this is a builders forum, I would strongly advise cancelling your order and building your own board. That way you get to make sure you like everything about it, because you built it. It may cost more, but 800$ and a single motor will get you one of the most reliable builds money can buy, plus building is indescribable fun. There are several experts on this forum that could help you, most have done countless builds. For inspiration you may want to talk to @longhairedboy @psychotiller @lox897 and there are many more.

 Amazingly cheap.  They exaggerate obviously on the range. Less volts is watt hours and less range.  I get 20 real world miles with 8ah x 46 volts so about 400wh and this is 4.4 x 36volts=
Depends what u want.  Every complete board I've seen is weak and slow compared to diy

Basically, the specs seem weak to me. those motors based on the watt ratings are weak, the range will be like 15 minutes of riding at full throttle on flat, way less if it can do any hills. Also, 6s 18650 batteries seem insane to me. You are limited in an 18650 pack by your discharge rate. Lipos can discharge almost always discharge at least 100 amps no problem. Those cells they are using are able to do 15 or 20 amps per cell in parallel. My guess is they are doing 2 groups probably, so 30-40 amps max. On 10s, I pull 40 amps on flat. At 6s I blew out a 120 amp esc, so I pulled more than 120 amps. This means you will be severely limited in your acceleration. But looking at the ratings of the motors, they probably can't handle more than 20 amps per motor anyways.

The whole board yells to me as "a toy for a kid to ride back and fourth in front of their house'. You won't get far, it will have weak acceleration, it won't be able to do any hills. And it's hard to say how many you can even upgrade later, seeing every piece of electronics they seem to use is designed for low amps, in what really is a super high amp system (due to the low voltage). Basically, you could build that board yourself for less, and have clear paths upgrade later. Or buy this now, get bored of it, and build your own later.

The price is so good, because low amp parts are way cheaper than the high amp parts our electric skateboards need. 6s batteries are way cheaper too than 12s batteries. I can why its so cheap, when you understand whats inside.

Hey thanks for the comments guys, I know this is a builders forum, but heck, this is one of the first complete skateboards with a dual drive hub motor for a resonable price. That's got to be worth discussing. In terms of hill climbing, they claim 25 degrees, which remains to be seen. What I found noticeable in the vids is the acceleration from standstill, driving in both directions (motor at front or back) and driving on rather wet surface, which doesnt seem to bother the motor. Motor looks well sealed inside and probably heat is not an issue due to its low wattage.

25 degrees I can safely say that it will not be able to cope with. 25% grade is more reasonable, but still unlikely for a hub drive.

Builders forum or not - that's a great price on dual hub setup!  

I doubt it will do the range claimed (they rarely do - especially the Chinese variants/clones), but if it works for you out of the box w/ good QC it should work ok!  If you are a heavier guy - i'd cancel and go DIY.  The videos i saw show it going really slow (as in poor acceleration), and some odd clicks/noises from one side when turning - not super encouraging.

Hey it's a gamble - can you burn $450 if it doesn't work out?  vs putting that $450 into a $600+ and nicer DIY build?

you got me, it's a ramp, but what matters is that your hill isnt steeper than the ramp and this board only has 2x250w and it can climb from standstill and that is kinda impressive.

The point is more toward the speed and the distance, any board can do 30m at 5km/h on a ramp, a real test is 500m at 20km/h over a shitty hill road (also the board in test was doing around 30km/h on the same hill).

The biggest question with hill climbing is how quickly do the motors heat up? People keep complaining about evolve shutting down due to heat on hill climbing. This board likely won't shutdown, but blow electronics when they get to hot. If you think the quality of this board is on par with the DIY boards, you will be very disappointed.

its' good to see some use and hills.  

The missing and critical variable for me is that you never see the rider.  

Yes, i could have my 90lb (40kg) niece ride the board up a ramp/hill/incline - but a normal sized rider (let along a gargantuan rider such as myself) will be _slow - or more likely **walking**_.

It's a budget board - i'd personally get the ego which seems to be a proven setup if slow.

or better yet - take that $$ and put it into a better DIY setup.  Ton's of options here to get inspired and spend that $!

I agree that their presentation could be better, but that doesnt mean that they are hiding something. These guys are workers from the factory, not pro-skaters. Btw you should know that Yuneec is a Chinese company aswell. Sure the Ego is proven and they have dealers all over the world. You can get it on Amazon and Ebay and 2nd hand. But why would I favor a weak single belt drive over a dual hub drive that promises to be way more powerful?

Now in terms of DIY. It's just not for me, I find it overly complicated, time consuming and dangerous, I have no workshop, no tools and no ambition to build my own board. Doesnt mean I'm trolling here. Maybe trying to bug you with a different perspective.

No worries and appreciate the question and discussion.  No issues w/ DIY not being your thing.  Totally understandable.

back on topic - why this is potentially misleading in my mind.  Not likely it's intentional, but when you don't see anything except the rider's shoes you have no idea on the load/weight the board is carrying.  So when smaller asian riders are half my weight - i watch this video and think i too can go up that incline (which i couldn't).  Not likely it's intentional, but definitely worth noting as folks get excited seeing these videos of them being ridden.

I don't have any issue whatsoever with chinese companies or components.  Most of what i use in DIY is made in China.  It's all in the QC and overall quality of what's made.  Good feedback here and elsewhere let's me know if it's worth the $.  Some things are more $, other less $ and a good value - regardless of where made.

The E-Go is a really well proven board, which is why i suggested it vs this less-known Koowheel.

Now the single belt motor vs hub motors.  This is where others likely will disagree, and i welcome their input to give you some perspective. 

A geared motor will allow for gearing below 1:1.  Those ratios (i usually aim for right around 3:1(3 motor : 1 wheel)) equal torque, acceleration, and hill climbing ability - with less top speed capability (i'm ok with that compromise).

Dual hubs is a great option, but it definitely may not out perform a single belt/geared motor for hills and acceleration.  It should do well on the flats assuming the same rider weight, but likely will suffer poor performance up hill where the geared motor has the 3:1 gear ratio to help keep rpm's up and keep power going to climb.

So depending on your weight, a hub motor(s) may work well, but i would set your expectations lower for hill climbing.  Especially if you aren't a light weight rider.

Now we should get the perspective of an expert - @LEVer - can you shed some light on this?

Well I saw the hub motor comparison that Jason did, Jacob vs. Hummie, and they seem to climb the hill pretty nicely. You can check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X8Nm1ZyMaM) if you havent seen it yet. I guess Carvon's also do well in the dual setup. So how do you think that dual hubs would be inferior to a single belt drive in terms of hill climb.
```

## \#18 Posted by: sl33py Posted at: 2016-09-06T22:26:59.052Z Reads: 389

```
i don't think you are understanding the idea of gearing.

a hub motor is 1:1 drive - no gears (stary's planetary gear being unique/unusual).  So every RPM of the motor = 1 RPM of wheel.

A more traditional belt motor setup will have some gear reduction.  So using Enertion's 15/36 - you get 2.4:1 - so 2.4 rpms of the motor for every 1 RPM of the wheel.

Keeping RPM's up w/ a brushless motor gives you more power/torque.

The hub motor comparison you linked (i saw it when originally posted) is a _hub motor comparison_.  Not a hub vs belt comparison.  Two hub motors being compared...

The new hub motors are awesome - some unique advantages with free-wheel resistance being really low, and super stealthy w/o the motor mount, belts, gears, etc.  But for a bigger guy and/or hills i still feel a belt drive is superior - even a single motor would likely climb and accelerate better w/ a larger rider like myself.  I can adjust gearing lower to give me better hill performance sacrificing top speed.  Take a look at any of the traditional speed calculators if you want to see the trade-offs.

Again - if you are 55kg/120lbs - a hub setup likely would work really well for you.  But a single belt setup still might out perform the dual hubs uphill.

here's a good thread where you can see a Boosted Dual+, Evolve Bamboo GT, and Stary do a hill climb.
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/boosted-dual-vs-stary-vs-bamboo-gt-hill-comparison/8756

What i'm asking you to read and note - is two belt drive setups and one hub (with planetary gears - not 1:1 hub drive).  Real world performance and the Stary does the worst of the 3.  Rider weight is obviously variable, but they look pretty close in size.
```

## \#19 Posted by: cantstopme Posted at: 2016-09-06T23:56:32.437Z Reads: 345

```
but this is a comparison between two dual belt drives and a single hub. Now of course I have looked into the Stary a bit and it really looks cool, light weight and all but I'm not sure whether their "planetary gear" (not pretending to know what it is) is doing the job. That is a special hub design. I think to make it fair you had to compare a dual belt with a dual hub. I would like to see that. I hope someone in the community who owns both can come up with it.
```

## \#20 Posted by: sl33py Posted at: 2016-09-07T00:24:34.579Z Reads: 365

```
let's simplify it a bit further for you.  A hub motor will not perform as well on hills as a *similar* belt drive setup.  Simple and you can now do additional research on what you want.  

a planetary gear is simply gear reduction like a belt.  just without a belt.  A set amount like 3:1 - multiple rotations of the motor for 1 rpm of the wheel.  I don't think Stary has released the specific gear reduction.  As for wear and noise - unknown and i'd rather swap belts as they wear.

If you get the Koowheel please post up your feedback when riding it.  I'm sure it'll work well on the flats, so as long as you don't expect it to climb bigger hills you should be fine.

I personally would still go belt before hubs (in a budget setup like this), but again i'm not an average sized rider.  You'll have to sort that out on your own.

The video is very misleading, I mean it's not that difficult to get a tripod, or another person to hold the camera. It looks interesting, but there are a lot of prebuilt options, and the newer prebuilt boards need to stand out against the competition not only in price, but quality, power, speed, etc.

we are saying 25%, sorry for misunderstanding.

Glad to see guys are talking about us, but we are new on electric skateboard,and we all are not skateboarder actually, so maybe not look so good and fast as what your guys want to see, but that doesn't mean our board can't do. 

We are the biggest manufacturer of hoverboard in China, we have work with the best motor supplier in China, and every single cell are original Samsung battery,our electric skateboard battery pack are with 20pcs 18650 cell.

We are new and we will prove,to let guys know Chinese factory can do something really good with really affordable price.

Honestly, its a GREAT board for the price. I am about to place an order for 5 boards (green color wheels). I am thinking about becoming a re-seller here in the USA and stock them here by December 27th right after Christmas. If your brother is interested in purchasing one let me know. I am not in the market to SELL someone something that is not good nor am I going to tell your brother to buy one because I might sell them. I own one and have been testing it and working out the kinks DIRECTLY with KooWheel and they have been very responsive. They even sent me the updated remote to resolve the disconnect issues and new screws.  

I just posted about the issues here: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/koowheel-hubs-dry-run/8838/17?u=speedyzach

Ordered it 2 days ago and should get it Friday, at the latest.  It is shipping outta Cali.  The guy was cool and called with 30 minutes of the order to ask me what color wheels I wanted.  I told him I wanted the fastest of course, orange. ;)  (no offense @SpeedyZach) 

Pretty excited to get it and start putting some of the claims to test.  We have some killer hills around here and I'm blocks from a trail that runs miles into the city.  Gonna try to talk @sl33py into coming and doing some videos with me.

I'm glad to hear @SpeedyZach looking to become a distro and the close relationship you have with the company.  I am assuming you would have parts as well?  I'm sure wheels will need to get replaced soon. I would also like to know how to get my hands on an extra battery or two.  Also, have they mentioned a stand-alone charger?

Hey I've had my Koowheel for around 2 months and after some tweaks and fixes it's been running like a dream. Only thing I would like to improve now is maybe use a better remote. Has anyone done any kind of mods to the Koowheel yet? I'm a complete newbie I wouldn't know how to do it yet but I would like to use the Benchwheel remote with it.

From that video review looking at the PCB it seems to be one big mainboard, TAOTAO I believe. Not sure if this is the same as a ESC. Anyone point me in the right direction?

Hey guys I'm planning on modifying my Koowheel, it involves permanently installing 2 of the Koowheel batteries on the board. Also I might switch the deck for a smaller 33" non-flex board. My DIY knowledge is limited, so I have a question regarding the batteries. Each battery pack comes in it's own enclosure with it's own BMS, I would probably remove the enclosure from 2 of these battery packs and put them both in some custom enclosure to fit it all in. If I understand this correctly, would I just need to connect the positive to positive and negative to negative from one battery to the other, then connect one of those to the VESC/controller board. 

I wouldn't be touching any of the individual cells or anything, that would be past my skill level, so I am wondering if the above would work. You can see the internals of the batteries here on this teardown video for any questions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDtqxf7BLiM

I am planning to build something similar to this, but with 2 battery packs instead of just one:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/5toexm/koowheel_deck_swap_jet_potato_33/

Any help is greatly appreciated. I am just trying to make the best of my cheap and first esk8 purchase.

For someone that has actually got one and knows what their talking about u like others that just talk BS. 

My first one broke after about a month of riding, it just cut out however this was a known problem and koowheel sorted it pronto. 
They sent me out a new one with the latest upgrades, known issue fixed and larger battery capacity. 

Whole process took two weeks. 
This one is bang on the money, I'm impressed and I push mine a bit more than I should. 

Top speed on normal is between 15 to 17 mph. Hits gradients pretty well although I haven't measured the gradients yet, and you get around 10 to 12 mile range. 

Tap 7 times and the top speed for me on the flat was 21.9 mph but it will get hot if you ride it hard in this setting and you only get about 7 miles out of the pack

Any more questions with a real world answer, just ask. 

And for the record, work directly with koowheel not the rebranded companies such as magneto. 
If anything goes wrong it's more long winded.

But the mass produced benchwheel that you so dearly love are an exception? 

All I'm saying  is that for the money, their a good peace  of kit and the service for any potential issues is top notch. 

And the fact that they have listened and improved the board to iron out the issues is commendable. 

So for anyone starting out that doesn't have the time or experience  to build a board and wants something that works,  I think this is as good an option as any. 

For you to claim that it is a bad idea period because of some preconceived ideas and no facts or experience is to wiseacre.

Antonio, I'm sorry for the bad experience, however from what I read Koowheel fixed all issues with bad connections and DOA motherboards. I'd call your experience a good one in terms of customer service. If you never riden the eboard I'd give it a new try, but if you have the budget for a DIY I'd definitely get one over the Koowheel.

We have been selling Koowheel skateboard for more than a year I must say the performance and reliability is outstanding, of course has been some issues with it at the beginning like any other new product in development but I must say the guys at Koowheel were always very collaborative with warranty issues and constantly improving the board version after version.

We just received the latest version and it's currently in stock. https://personalelectrictransport.co.uk/shop/electric-skateboard/koowheel-electric-skateboard-dual-hub-motor/

-Improved PCB board with electronics potting.
-5500mAh battery upgrade (+5km)

We also include a **FREE[ Carry Bag](https://personalelectrictransport.co.uk/shop/accessories/electric-skateboard-accessories/koowheel-skateboard-carry-bag/) original from Koowheel** with all orders.

I've been following this thread for awhile. is there a single person with a koowheel that hasn't had a problem.  I'm not hunting for great customer service but a board that works. What version are they on now? I was joking before that I was waiting for version four to come out but sounds like they're there now.

Talking about our experience as a reseller, the percentage of faulty units it's less than 10% and we have sold +200 units since started. 

Personally I do have one and no problems at all, I should say that I don't use the board every day.

The common complaint from clients and us as a business is lack of replacements but this is changing now, I guess that also Koowheel themselves realised that and they started releasing parts, we are expecting all kind of replacements in the next months.

Many problems comes when people buy from Aliexpress and other Chinese dealers, you never know when the boards are coming from, usually there are dealers not Koowheel itself. 

There is not a version number, is more like batches, they make improvements and changes every batch depending on dealers and client feedback. 

I hope all make more sense now...

Hi electric-skateboard-enthusiasts,
today I received my Koowheel board from a german reseller on hood.de.
It came with the updated battery (5500mAh), so I guess it is one of the newer batches. Another surprise was, that the printing on the hub-motors says "3.5AMK36V350W". Seems as if they silently upgraded the motors to 350Watt ones.
Just did a quick 1km run to check if it was acting normal, which it did.
I'll post here if I experience any quirks with tbe board.

Hey Hummie! For some of us, putting up $500 on a DIY without any knowledge of electrics/electronics or a decent workshop/tools, a $500 entry level board working out of the box may be a safer and smarter choice! I'm happy to do so and then move on more safely and knowingly to modding and building from that. It's a matter of using limited resources wisely!! 😉I appreciate the work you and many members of this forum do and will surely be using it, but some of us just need to do things at a different pace!

I'm 16 y/o with no knowledge about electronics and I don't know if I even have a working drill at home. I just finished my 500 euros diy build, I just had to buy a 16 euros soldering iron and wait for parts from a group buy. Just study on the forum for a couple of months. There's really no need to invest in a Chinese board (they make you pay it 500 for it, that means it costs them 250, that's obviously not reliable) that will probably cost you a lot of headaches when you can build a better one and learn a lot of stuff

Different strokes..
But without a doubt for 500$, which is maybe the same price as the already made cheap boards especially with shipping...get a vesc, a battery, an xt90s plug, a soldering iron and 60/40 solder, and a mini trigger remote and plug them all in, or just show everyone here a pic of that stuff asking what to do now and they'll be falling over to tell you how to do it.

The performance difference...it's like a silent Ferrari vs some 1920 antique without a muffler that's almost out of gas always.

I've built 6 boards already, the boards are tons of fun to build and ride and they were all around much better than a Koowheel. However when I tried to build a USD 500 board I came up with a pretty crappy board and a very long waiting time, parts were not in stock, I had to wait 2 months for the parts to arrive all the way from China, I also had to wait for a group buy as in order to get a decent deal,  I went with a single motor to save money and a 10s1p, Chinese BMS and a blank small deck from eBay, the charger was a Chinese 2A one and the amount of work I had to had to put on the tables was not worth it, you can add a burnt vesc I had to ship all the way back and loose time and money on shopping.  

At the end I compared the Koowheel (latest version) against my DIY board and the latest version  Koowheel was much better and pro for that price, better manufacturing, craftsmanship and top speed, the only thing better about my board was looks as I not a fan of their deck design.  

In this forum, recommending a chinese board is forbidden as it's a builders forum, however to be 100% honest they've put out a pretty good product for USD 550, nobody could argue that, besides the latest V3 version with pottied electronics seems to be pretty reliable and I've heart no complaints since then, I'm pretty sure they will have some issue in the future and a DIY as well. 

Hope to not get killed by people around here for being honest

Hi, a have a LecDec aka "Chinese clone" and until now I hadn't any problems with it. I must have put more than 300 km (I use a gps tracking to know) and I have good things to say about my electric longboard, the range is good (more than 17 km), the speed is more than I can handle, etc.

Maybe the Chinese boards aren't that bad after all... :) My only concern now is how will I get spare parts since LecDec now is a Stary representative and directed me to the longboard manufacture when I asked for parts.

The seller had direct communication with one of Koowheel's warehouses and assured me this was the latest board with updated battery/bluetooth antenna etc. Pretty excited for it to get here.

$ 260 + shipping which is US$ 120 to USA, so at the end would be US$ 380, still an unbeatable price.

I think there is always a market for cheaper products for people that can't afford a more pro product or just want to know if eboarding is for them, as soon they are hooked up they will diffinitely buy a DIY board o a brand board

i agree with this. I'm thinking there may be a way to mod the koowheel to get a little more sauce oout of it, kind of like i've been doing with the evolve bamboo GTs. 

Also i have a customer who sent me a penny board a long time ago and i'm just getting around to putting a motor on it. Obviously that's just something we all have to do: The Penny Build, as they say, but i think there's something there. If i had a "nickel" sized 7 ply deck, i think i could build a lightweight single drive that would compete in the "Slushi Run" category of boards, and be far less expensive and easier to assemble than my typical builds.

More powerful, Hell yes! Lower quality not so much, we had to spend close to 3k to get the hub motors useable and safe, honestly unless you own a Mach 1 Elite or have our new hub motors it best not to make assumptions of quality. I ride my Mach 1 everyday about 10miles to and back. So far no problems besides my urethanes getting nasty and replaced after 2k miles.

Thanks for your honest review. I share the same opinion on Koowheel board. I got mine a few days ago, still too early impression but so far, so good. 
My only thing against it is the deck and I'm looking for a new deck. There's a cool thread on Reddit https://amp.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/5toexm/koowheel_deck_swap_jet_potato_33/
with a Jet Potato. I'd like to have a shorter board and have been looking around for alternatives... and also price is a concern... I'd like a cruiser deck 1kick. Any recommendations? What minimum width would also be advisable? Would this be a good possibility? https://www.ebay.com/itm/322042150729

Sorry for bothering you with this but I just need some advise from PRO skateboard buyers. 

I work for a company that sells EV and we can suggest products that they add to their shops. So I suggested the Koowheel. They were psyched and started their marketing campaign because Koowheel was paid and they had their money. 

Now the issue. We are almost a week past delivery date and still no shipment of boards, no communication from Koowheel nothing. 

I asked somebody else at Koowheel a gazillion times where our boards are and they apparently haven't even started producing them, what to do? 

I feel like Koowheel is a fraud and that we have paid xx.xxx euro for a batch of boards that are never going to be delivered.

NOTE: This is for the Kooboard, the new one.

I can't tell you what to do, but me personally - I would email them and tell them they need to respond to you before (insert date 7 business days away) or you will default their answer to "We aren't sending you your boards".  I would include that on EVERY communication to them.  And if they pass the deadline, reverse the charges and report them to the police.  Also at this point you might want to do that anyway because you don't want them to get mad at you and send you all defective ones

You are right. I need to stay relaxed and wait. Right now we are really bumped out that they might try to scam us because we did a direct payment. So no CC payment (i know, i know...). 

I will keep you posted!

Ohh... in that case, I'd let them know on every single communication that they have until day X or court papers will be filed.  That's much worse.  If you let them control you, they will.  You're the customer -- control them.  This strategy works well for me, but I've never been in your exact situation.

It has been a long and painful waiting time for us too. 

After a week riding and testing the 2nd GEN Kooboard I can say it is AMAZING!!! and confirm we have stock ready to ship, all checked UK next day delivery. Spare urithane wheels and safe lights still to come and we will complete orders as soon we got them.

the video you are talking about is about the V2 (that never existed) from the 1st generation D3m Koowheel.

The 2nd gen is totally a new board in terms of performance.

You are welcome to come and try by yourself, we are pretty confident with this board and Koowheel as brand.

Hey there Mountchristopher senior, I saw your vids on youtube, well done for finding the BMS problem and fixing it, and a big "WTF you twats" to Koowheel! . of all people they should have sent you battery replacements, you were singing their praises to begin with, regardless of how good/bad their product is, all they had to do to stay "reputable" was send out a replacement, you would have made vids about it, and they would have looked pretty good, regardless of quality,  their loss in the end, mate!  I've not had major problems with mine yet, I bought mine through Voltaboards in Holland and they seem like decent folk, we'll see if I ever need the warranty? hopefully not. go easy Mt.Christopher senior, thanks for the info!

Only need to get new rubber for the back wheels on just the one board but they are only $22 for the set of 2 so that is not bad and don't need to do it until next summer probably... glad I fixed the motherboard boxes and replaced the bms on these boards but now my kids want to build their own board!!! But after all of the work and how close summer is we will probaly just wait until the end of summer to sell these and buy the parts we will need to build 3 boards

Koowheel ignoring your battery replacement request...sad thing is that they will likely said your fix voids the warranty if they ever get back to you. I hate these companies' horrendous business practices. Just opening it up probably voids it as well.

Like I mentioned, probably easier to sell these in the FB group since this is a DIY forum and we can build this stuff.

Hi All,

I wanted to post some pictures of the KooWheel charger that started smoking.
Purchased the board/delivered on Mar. 23, 2018, used the charger almost everyday, no more than 3-4 hours per day. Charger failed within a week.

HUGE THANK YOU TO KOOWHEEL USA FOR REMEDYING THIS ISSUE.

The capacitors closest to the board connection seem to have exploded.
(See the cotton bursting out...)
I suspect the capacitors can not handle the current discharge directly from the battery.

DO NOT USE THE SUPPLIED KOOWHEEL DC ADAPTER TO CHARGE BATTERY!

I RECOMMEND PLUGGING THE CHARGER INTO BOARD... THEN INTO WALL... NO MORE THAN 4 HOURS

Umm you mean plug charger into wall then into board? You want to precharge the cap in the charger before you plug it into the board. Really depends on the bms ( my bms the charge side is live ). So if I plug my charger into charge port first I get a rush of current into the charger vs plugging the charger into wall first :slight_smile:

Hi Acido,

Roberto here from PET. Regular maintenance is mandatory, check screws are always tighten but not too much if that make sense, dry after riding on wet and store indoors at room temperature. I recommend to charged using the board instead of the external adaptor. Avoid hard vibrations riding on rough tarmac.

Hi there,

has anybody an idea how to update/flash the ESC on a Koowheel d3m board? The speed controller seems to have a serial port and I wonder if it is possible to alter ESC settings (like on a VESC) or update/flash new firmware.

I would like to limit the speed to a certain speed so that it is in compliance with local regulations because otherwise you can be prosecuted quite severely here.

Thanks!
```

No you can't. As you said is a ESC not a VESC so you can not modify it without the factory software. The first speed is like 20km/h. How slow do you want it?
```

Hi rey8801. Thanks for your answer! Yes i wasn't expecting VESCs to be in there. However you can often change settings in regular BECs as well. I am deep into the RC hobby and most likely there is a way to alter settings on all kind of BECs. Just wondering if someone found out what controller exactly is used here and if anybody knows a software that allows settings to be changed or new compatible firmware that can be flashed.

I want to reduce the speed so that it maxes out at 6km/h in normal mode and is open in the secret turbo mode (7 pressed to the ON/OFF switch). There is a stupid law here in Germany and riding a motorized vehicle that goes faster than 6km/h needs a registration, drivers license and insurance. If the driver is caught in action, he will be prosecuted for two severe offenses: violation of driving without a driver's license and violation of compulsory insurance. For both of those offenses you can get arrested and will earn yourself a remark in your certificate of good conduct. You might even loose your drivers license for driving a non-registered vehicle. You see... not too much fun riding esk8s in Germany.

having a board that only goes 6km/h after you power cycle it would be a huge advantage if you get checked by the police. ;-)

Another idea (but not nearly as elegant) would be modifying the remote controller. A little resistor in combination with a reed switch (magnetic switch) could be added that reduces the signal of the throttle potentiometer. Then use a little neodymium magnet at the remote to go full speed (reed switch = closed) and when being checked by police flip away the little magnet (reed switch = open) and the board will only go slow regardless of how hard you hit the throttle. :wink:
```

I know about Germany's law, it's sucks! I heard about horrible stories, so I understand your fear. If you find out how to modify it the all forum will appreciate your contribution. As far as I know noone here did it. You can also think about replace the ESC with a double VESC. For the space you have in the Koowheel enclosure the new Flipsky dual vesc will probably fit and you will have an open source VESC for a bit more than 100 euro. To a VESC you can attach bluetooth module and adjust speed ecc from your phone. For instance in mine, I have different modes and if I need someone to try it I just need to switch between the preset profiles I made to reduce speed and watt. The nice thing that I see a perfect application for your situation is that if you set the lower speed as default mode, then you only need to change the mode from your phone, but in case the police stops you you only need to reboot the board (on/off) and the board will be in the default configuration again. Basically if you do not definitely change the mode, only the default configuration will be loaded on the vesc when you turn it on. I think that is the best solution, for better acceleration, power, control... @moon is organising a group buy for the dual unit. Just my two cents :wink:

Other mods I would do on the koowheel (I had it too!). Change the esc battery connector to a xt60, solve the disconnection problem. If you do not like battery sag, replace the cells with Samsung 30Q. Plus the VESC you have another board

- 3D printed modular enclosure
- 10s3P (of whatever cells you prefer)
- Held together by 4xM4 struds

only a few issues:
- you'll need to remove the front truck to swap the battery
- wiring of the batterie groups inside the enclosure will be quite tricky and fiddly
- not waterproof

color of cells is just random for fitting

Awesome thank you. Unfortunately there are 2 version of the Koowheel Battery v1 = 4300mAh (fits pretty much perfectly the Samsung 22p) and a v2 5500mAh (this is also said to be Sasmung cells - however it could very well be LG Cells). 

I want to build a smaller battery that is air-travel safe (i.e: <100 Wh) ... do you think a 10S1P with Q30 or VTC6 will be able to deliver enough Amperage for that kind of use?

Hmm?? However both variants (3000mAh) do end up at: 3Ah * 4.2V * 10cells = 126Wh
Still too much, I'd need something with a little bit less capacity but more Amperage... so to say 2380 mAh

Oh yes! The Samsung 25R looks promising.... how do you "oficially" calculate the Wh of a battery?  Capacity x 4.2V (at max voltage) ...or... Capacity x 3.6(rated Voltage)?

The later would sum up to:
2500mAh x 3.6V x 10 cells = 90Wh

I could even go for 11 cells:
2500mAh x 3.6V x 11 cells = 99Wh (PERFECT).  and the additional cell might very well compensate for a little bit of voltage sag

What do you mean with 11 cells? If you use the normal ESC is programmed for 10s you can not go 11s. I would suggest to make two 90Wh battery adn then you connect them together when you need it and get 10s2p out of it.

Very nice idea.... ;-) Yeah!.... make a plugable 10S 1P 2P 3P system and travel with seperate 90Wh packs! =) ....... I was thinking about 11S because most ESCs are rated for more than 10S (e.g. VESC... up to 13S)

yes but those are vescs, on koowheel you have ESC which are not open source. MEaning you can not customised. Of course if  you change it to a dual vescs set up (like 2 FLipsky vesc or the new dual 4.20 VeSC for like 100 Euro) then you have th benefit of VESC and you will have more power, better braking ecc... For the battery definitely make multiple 1p battery is a good way. On one of the battery you connect the BMS and make the balance leads with jst connects, so you will only need to plug them into the other 1p battery and make whatever you want.

Already ordered a Flipsky Dual-VESC .... will try to run the KooWheel ESC with 11S anyhow. If the magic smoke comes out this will not be the end of the world. Has anybody tried to do this before? If yes and it is certainly sure that the smoke will come out this would just be a stupid experiment and I might change my mind =D

Believe me it won't work. The ESC is programmed for a 10s set up. Best scenario in won't move, in the worse It will brake. Just connect the dual VESCs, make bigger battery and your Koowheel will be another board. Then the last thing you could do is to change the hubs to more powerful ones, but for that you need a VESC for sure otherwise you won't be able to deliver enough current.

Oh wow! I just realized the FlipSky Dual-FSESC 6.6 is out:
https://flipsky.net/collections/new-accessories/products/dual-fsesc6-6-based-upon-vesc6-with-aluminum-heatsink

I wonder if it's really worth the premium charge in comparison to the Dual-FSESC 4.2? Major difference seems to be 100A vs. 200A continuous current draw. Are there any other crucial differences in functionality that I might have missed?

You would need to dicharge those packs below 3.6v for them to be <99wh ;)

Acido you are right. However you must always take into account that the "real world" capacity does not count for a bureaucratic TSA security officer. So it is better to stick to the official rules to calculate the capacity. Hence my question if this is based on rated voltage or max cell voltage. There is no way to discuss with a TSA officer. You can only hope that he can calculate simple numbers and that the result is in your favour ;-)

Sorry this is a bit off-topic: Yesterday my FlipSky Dual-VESC arrrived and it is awesome. I also ordered one of their Bluetooth modules (https://flipsky.net/collections/accessories/products/core51822-ble4-0-bluetooth-2-4g-wireless-module-nrf51822-onboard-ws82013) .... However it does not show up as a Bluetooth device on any Apply device (tried iPhone 6, 7, X, and Ipad 5th Gen) - nothing...... It works with Android though. Any idea what might be wrong?

Which app are you using? Moreover is a BLE module it won't show up in the bluetooth device. You need to test it with a BLE app. Like Serial BLuetooth Terminal for Android. I am sure there is something similar for IOS too.

I don't know if ti does work with android has to be something simple to explain why it doesn't work with IOS. I do not use IOS so I can not help sorry. Did you set it correctly on the VESC tool? Meaning can you read the telemetry data on your android device or you can only see the module?

Yes set everything up correctly "PPM + UART " as application, 115200 baud... works with Android like a charm (at least on my Nexus 7 tablet - which is a big bit for driving arround with) . However it does not work with Google PIXEL (first one).... the VESC Mobile tool reports library incompatibilities with the most recent Android version. And with iOS nothing happens at all. Too sad

By reading in the thread they also use 9600 buad. did you try it?
Forthe library incompatibilities you need an orginal HM-10 or flash the original firmware on your module. You can find a giude on the arudino forum and youtube. With IOS is not needed usually though

Oh great! Did not read about the 9600 baud. I will try and report back... thank you very much for your help. Will also try the HM-10 original firmware then. I was just curious because those error messages popped up right when starting the VESC tool app... even before searching or connecting the BLE module. But anyhow... sometimes there is some magic involved! =D Thanks man!

No problem. Unfortunately I do not have experience with IOS and I do not use that app. I use Ackmaniac's app but is not available for IOS.

Hope I'm posting this in the right place, don't want to derail your thread.
After 1 year and couple weeks my koowheel died on my, 
A screw that holds the BMS in place came loose and shorted the BMS.
Not at all surpeized cos I've been dropping kerbs and pretty much Hammering it for the last year, so overall I'm pretty Impressed with that. I was expecting something like this from day 1.
Now to the point.
Where can I get a BMS replacement? one that fits in the case prefferably.
 I'm in the UK by the way.
Thanks ya'll

Hi,

I'm brand new to Electric Longboarding but have skated and longboarded for years.  That said I have a few questions as just ordered the Koowheel 2nd Generation Kooboard last night.

1) What size are the bushings on the trucks?  I'd like to order some aftermarket bushings, cone and barrel, in the same duros as what's on my other longboard trucks.

2) Out of curiousity, since I've never looked at the board(any e longboard) up close...can other trucks be swapped in?  Will the Hub Motor Assemblies just bolt on or are the trucks designed specifically for those Hub Motor Assemblies?

3) How much of a concerns is water with this board?  For example, if at the local park/paved trails the sprinkler system wets the pavement and there might be small puddles sporadically at low spots.  Should I not ride it on wet pavement? 

Thanks in advance, any info./advice is greatly appreciated.

Tony

Hey, I'm new to all the eboard DIY stuff, but I wanna start with small steps. I have a koowheel v2 and I really like swappable battery design, so I thought I'll start tinkering with it a bit. 

First, I wanna change the trucks, wheels and switch to motor drive. Later, build a better battery pack and switch to VESC, change deck. So my questions are below.

Any idea on how powerful koowheel's ESC is? What happens if I buy something like 63xx motors? Will current ESC give enough power for them to spin  with a ~40V coming from batteries? Or its just a waste of time?
```

Hey, no, no way, that esc puts out something like 7-10 amps only, will not drive not hub motors also.

Your project is totally feasible but you are starting from the wrong modification. You want more power keep the hubs they can give you more. Change battery and and ESC to a VESC and you have a new way more powerful board.

Ok guys I need help. I have a koowheel 5500 mah. Had it since may last year. Had some ups and downs with it like common battery problems, wheels snap of from trucks while riding. Hit by a car inside a roundabout (not my fault). Still alive and well though 😂. Now I have this motherboard issue.
Symptoms:
When I accelerate for a short while, maybe 3 sec the controller shuts off and comes back after 2 sec  and want to throw me off or don't come back at all until I plug into the charger. I checked the voltage 12 v Out from battery. And then back to 41 volt when plugged back to charger.
I can come around this problem by holding the throttle for 2 sec then apply for a small breaking then the board will not shut off. Then in this manner  I can go forward 😂. Fucked up i know.
I have maybe thought it is capacitors problem. So I soldered a big 2200 uf cap. Just before red and black  cable goes into the motherboard.
Still same problem. 
What is the problem?
I have tryed swap batteries, still same. 
When I start it up side down it can go forever. So it's something with my weight on it. Only 75 kg.
Please help :)
