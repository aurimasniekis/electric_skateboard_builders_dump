Hi. One of the motors on my benchwheel dual stopped working (it just kind of shudders and buzzes). It's not the motor cos it works fine if I connect it to the other side's wiring. I'm thinking it must be the ESC... does that sound right? If so, is it possible to fit a new pair of ESCs? Any help greatly appreciated.
