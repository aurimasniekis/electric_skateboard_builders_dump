"SPECTRAâ€™s battery module has the same batteries powering Tesla" very interesting but definitely looks like something a little kid would get for their birthday or something.

Looks slow, and 12.4 miles seems crazy for such a small battery. 12 of those cells at 2.5 Ah is only 126 Wh. I am interested in the remoteness technology idea though. Curious to see how they work...

Yeah, that's what I'm interested in too. I don't think anyone's ever put a gyroscope in a board before. Not sure if it's a super good idea. Slow for a board that size is a good idea. I've been riding an arcboard for nearly 4 months now, and it's very powerful for it's size. I took a fall on my very first ride because I wasn't expecting that kind of power out of such a small board and motor, and shifted the throttle to max near a small steep slope. There's just not much space to correct my footing if things go wrong.

How was the remote-less function? It sounds like a really cool idea on paper. But I can't help but feel like it will take some getting used to especially when I'm shifting my weight while turning. I tend to have very tight bushings and use alot of my body weight for turning. I feel safer on an eboard that way.
