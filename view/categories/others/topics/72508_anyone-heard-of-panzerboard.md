I missed the chance to get the Backfire Ranger X1 before the price went up. I never heard of this company before and haven't seen anything on these in Google search. Look like another chinese made All Terrain with Hub motors. What are your opinions?

A good mtb below 1500 doesn't exist. Most are above 2000. Take into account that a proper li-ion pack with a high enough A rating for mountain boards usually costs around 450 USD and how little that alone would leave for quality components.

Stop it.  Please stop it.  Cheap chinese crap.  They couldn't even design a proper deck with out bolting on side panels.  Really its just frustrating.  Look at the video when he climbs the little incline.  Tells you all you need to know.  Oh and Panzer board?  Really?

Never heard of the company but just by looking at their campaign it seems a bit sketchy. The goal is flexible which means they will receive your money even if they don't reach their goal.
It also seems weird to start a indiegogo campaign when the board is pretty much done. Right now they are currently "optimizing parts" and ready to ship in less than 3 months for half of retail price.

Seems like one of those products where you feel like you get a good deal but it turns out to be a shitty product.

I think Stryke board is better then.. it uses chinese board as a platform but they market it as aggresive off road board by doing lots of jumps (at least what i saw on their videos)

https://www.strykeboards.com


There there are Tranzite boards.. though not sure will they hit market or not (had a kickstarter)
https://www.tranzite.com

(Looks like they made 2nd edition now, with 2 hub motors also)

Hi, thank you for mentioning PANZERBOARD in this forum. Our company CELCIUS TECHNOLOGY is based in Hong Kong, we manufacture equipment for LE and Military. But the PANZERBOARD is our first electric skateboard. If you would like to know more about us, you can google ‚ÄúCelcius Technology‚Äù or visit our website [www.celciustechnology.com](http://www.celciustechnology.com)

This forum is great, there are always room for improvements and we would like to hear more from professionals like you. Please let us know what do you think about this design.

The GTX Carbon looks good, but Why 10" wheels? I would prefer 6.5" to 8" Wheels, because I'm not going to be on dirt and grass all the time. I just want to be able to ignore the cracks and small rocks on the street and the occasional transition to grass and dirt to avoid obstacles.

Where to find more information on your website about your board? The links go in the nowhere.
Why the deck has mounted on concave instead just to directly integrate it in the deck?
If to watch your promo video it looks like the board is already kind a out off power when climbing small hills.
Is it due to the voltage sag? Which batteries you use? Or is it due to too less power of the hub motors?
Why the battery box is on the down site?
If you in rough terrain you likely to rip everything off. As min it should be some how integrated in or on top of the deck. A box with corners on the down is definitely a bad idea when rubbing over stones.

Agree... What you guys are building is not making logical sense...
If it is a Mountain Board than 10" Wheels, Bindings, and Battery & Components on top... Mountain Boards would be a smaller market than Urban Street Carvers.
If it is an Urban Carver than 6.5" to 8" Wheels for cracks and small rocks and sometimes hoping  on to grass to avoid obstacles (not going on grass all the time)... Look at Lacroix Boards, they created a masterpiece of balance between power, control and feel of a board.

@DragonFZ Thank you for your input! We tried many different skateboards with 6.5‚Äù to 8‚Äù wheels. But with the road condition here, in our opinion the 10‚Äù tire (the wheel size is 5.45‚Äù) is more comfortable and safer. We build this board for more adventurous and to be a go anywhere board, from sandy rocky shorelines to muddy trails. The large tires absorb a lot of the vibration from riding, there is less stress on our feet. The large and wide tires have more rubber on their track, make a better contact with the road, better grip and traction. With pneumatic tire, the rider can adjust the pressure based on riding condition and comfort level. It also gives the board the ability to ride on snow.

@Andy87 At the moment, the link on the website will direct you to our Indiegogo campaign. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/panzerboard-powerful-all-terrain-e-skateboard If you view the Indiegogo website from your mobile, on top of the perks, you‚Äôll ‚ÄúRead the story>;‚Äù, please click that button.  The trucks are mounted on the board, supported by a piece of aluminum on top of the deck, it is much secure because the screws are tightened on stronger materials. We can also adjust the spring tension from the top of the board, without turning the board upside down.

![GTX-CARBON%20dwg|690x413](upload://3UyKN9NtEcWO96Zs1uYOdv9RZMK.jpeg) 

The current video is made short on purpose because of the advertisement duration. Some of you may think that the board is unable to climb the hill, that‚Äôs not true. This board can climb just fine. That scene was made to show the board move from grass to pavement and to a small hill and then stop. If you pause the video you can see some bags and camera equipment behind the tree, that is where our team rest. We will make another video with more detail explanations.

![GTX-CARBON%20gc1%20dwg|690x276](upload://ddgz1ntlwIQyH9E3zxvJF46D5wu.jpeg) 
With the 10‚Äù tire the ground tolerance is high enough. But binding the battery and components on top is a good idea, the battery and electronic compartment can be installed on top with simple modification. We can also customize it for our customers. If you like smaller wheels, we can also custom build it for you.

What ESC are you using? Judging by the enclosure, it is one that is capped at 50A total.

What cells are you using? My guess is something with a 10A discharge rating, 50a total. 

To set realistic expectations, perhaps market it as an urban board.

Hi @CELCIUS
This ![image|690x271](upload://cugq0Hv81SL75P4FSyoVD3KQoYL.jpeg) 
is definitely a week point and I would worry to break down the enclosure when going off-road.
It‚Äôs common practice to adjust the springs from the up, just look the trampa boards.
It‚Äôs nothing new and nothing special.
I can‚Äôt find any information about materials you use.
What‚Äôs the enclosure made out of?
Is the deck full carbon or only carbon enforced?
Did you thought about adding bindings on the deck?
What batteries in which configuration do you use?

Videos are nice but nothing tells more than real world experience.
If you think your board perform how you present it, the best way would be to sent out some samples to trusted members here in the for so that they can have a test ride and write a review about it üòâ

No...but it would be worse with 8 inch wheels. Personally, I am somewhat limited by the 5:1 gear drive. There is always something on an e-mtb that will mess up clearance. The difference there is that it is a solid piece of Aluminium with skid pads/ it will take a beating. Plastic battery tray in the middle and at the bottom is a no-no, I agree. Most of us here will destroy that within a few days.

Haven‚Äôt found this information.
Where is it written?
If it‚Äôs like this than sure it‚Äôs more robust,
But üòÖ still the enclosure is bolted to the deck, so there is a week point again.
Aaand honestly I wouldn‚Äôt want to street or better to say mud face because my enclosure get stuck somewhere instead of just sliding over.

I think with the 10‚Äú you already have a good clearance, but I would as min make the enclosure over the full length of the deck down side. For me it looks like there is not much flex anyhow in the deck. @CELCIUS please correct me if i‚Äòm wrong

Talking about my own Trampa/has nothing to do with the Panzer. Bought a Chinese board that has the exact same enclosure as an entry type board 2 years ago. The panzerboard appears to be using the exact same battery/esc/li-ion kit. If it is indeed the same kit, the Panzer is not going to provide a good offroad experience and the enclosure will crack easily upon impact.

Similar to that, just paired with different trucks/motors.

Ah ok i mixed that up.
Thought you have seen somewhere in indiegogo the information about the aluminum case...

I stopped loading the side you linked...
I have seen the logo in the top and that‚Äôs enough for me to understand that those not long living and performing parts...

Thank you for your input guys! 

**GTX-Carbon materials**
Deck: full carbon fiber
Wheels & Trucks: CNC Processed Cast Aluminum
Top Aluminum: CNC processed 6061 T6
Tires: Rubber. 
Battery: 42v 10Ah

@Andy87 If our campaign reach the goal, we will send 2 samples to the trusted member here.  If you don't like the wheel, at least the full carbon fiber deck is awesome :wink:

We are designing another model, it will be something like the pic below. Your advice will may help us to build a good product for professionals. What is your preferred top speed and range? The box can be smaller depending on the size of the battery. Now we know that most of you prefers smaller wheel, we'll change that fat tire to a smaller one. Let us know what you think, we really want to build a good product, hopefully we can keep the price reasonable.

The tires full rubber tires?
We have some guys in here using 9‚Äú wheels and they very happy with it.
Personally I don‚Äôt like the battery mounted on the tail of the deck.
With the battery in the middle the balance of the board is way much better.
If you use bindings I think it‚Äôs the way to go anyway.
Just keep in mind that in case your deck has a flex you should place the box with spacer so that the case doesn‚Äôt get broken or restrict the flex.

If you set your focus on off road everything between 40-50km/h is a good speed but more important that the hub motors have enough torque to move you through difficult terrain.
Traction control would be one thing which maybe can help with it too and already possible with a vesc/focbox controller.

Regarding range, 20-30km real off road I think is more than enough. This should be 30-40km on good roads. Maybe a swappable battery concept would be an idea too.

@telnoi the discharge rate was 5C, but we will make some modifications. 

@Andy87 The tires are full rubber, pneumatic, tubeless. We will change the dimension to 9". Thank you for your suggestions. We are working on the new design, and post another video when ready.
