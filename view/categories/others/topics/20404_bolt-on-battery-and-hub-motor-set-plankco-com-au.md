Starting up soon in Aus - big claims on the specs for such a small unit.
35km/hr 25k range 30% grade hills :confused:
They have vanguard clones listed as coming soon - might be a decent supplier for blank decks.
They claim they are using samsung cells - wonder what the specs are

Definitely a rebranded onan X2.  $400 plus shipping on Alibaba.  Kickstarterâ€‹: ivory boards in Australia or nuff skateboards in the US.  I ordered the nuff for science because it's actually cheaper than the sample price I got on alibaba
