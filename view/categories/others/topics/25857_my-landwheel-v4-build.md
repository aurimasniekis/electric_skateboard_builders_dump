```
After much back and forth and a few boards that just didn't quite convince me (Koowheel, Benchwheel stock), I started talking to the folks at Landwheel and weighed my options. If the above boards taught me anything over the last couple of months, it's that I really enjoy the hobby. I come from years of flying FPV, quads, fixed wing etc. and these electric skateboards really got me hooked fast! SO - after a defective Koowheel and modded Benchwheel (stock batteries died on me 4 rides in), I pulled the trigger and ordered a V4 Landwheel.

**Deck: https://www.skatepro.nl/209-15701.htm**
**Lights: https://shredlights.com/collections/products/products/copy-of-esk8-combo-pack**

This will be my ongoing review, as I've literally just unpacked and put it on my Enuff deck (which btw is way more compact than the Benchwheel longboard). Points I will address over the next couple of days/weeks/months:

* **brakes**: probably my biggest concern. Mike gave me some great feedback and I am just gonna have to take things real slow here. My fingers are itching to start on fast mode, but I'll keep it more casual on my first couple of rides.
* **mileage**: they advertise 12 - 15km. The battery is a 36V 3200mAh lipo, so I guess we'll see about that. If I get 8 - 10km I'd be a happy camper. I'll also have to test this in both speed modes. I am getting 15km out my modded Benchwheel with 2 6S 4000mAh in parallel, so this should be interesting.
* **speed**: probably too fast to be healthy, but I'll measure both speed modes.
* **hill climbing**: we have lots of hills in my area, my modded Benchwheel may not be the fastest but it takes 'em like a champ! So that will be a helpful reference.

Below some pictures. I will update this thread with further findings, videos etc. as I go.

Thanks and - wish me luck :stuck_out_tongue:

Here are my first observations from yesterday:

First of all, brakes: yes, they are super touchy, and definitely a weak point in comparison to other boards. It almost feels like there is a bit of dead zone on the trigger when applying brakes (not on forward throttle) and then you have about 1 - 2mm where the brakes feel somewhat useful. Beyond that point the motors just stop dead in their tracks, Mike wasn't kidding! So go practice your foot braking gents ;). Both the Benchwheel and Koowheel have way superior and more reliable brakes in my opinion.

Which is a bit of a shame, because everything else about this just feels so... premium!
Acceleration is smooth! Speed is ridiculous, it's faster in "slow mode" than my Benchwheel in fast mode. I haven't had a chance to measure this yet, as I was too busy getting the hang of the brakes system and not flying off the board :stuck_out_tongue:

I've also tried "fast mode" because.... I obviously had to. Holy moly! I didn't push the board beyond 2/3 throttle because it was ridiculously fast. Like crazy fast! I don't think they exaggerated with the whole 45kmh claim,  but I will provide some numbers soon.

Mileage seems great for now: I rode the thing 6km around the neighborhood with fair uphill parts and returned home with 4 out of 4 bars. Later I am doing a 8km ride to work and I am 99% certain the battery will last long enough, I have a spare battery worst case.

The build quality of the remote feels the most solid out of all 3 systems so far, it's really nice, although I still prefer the Benchwheel style remote ergonomics.

Anyway, more to come soon.

Even in low mode they are WAY too sensitive and dangerous to be recommended :)

As mentioned by others in this forum, I think the fundamental problem is that you (the people at Landwheel) think that the brakes need to be stronger. 
They do **NOT** need to be stronger, they are strong enough. The problem is that braking needs to be less _sensitive_, which means that braking strength needs to be spread over the entire lower throttle range:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/1/a113fb5664dbd3f8f7deb9bd2bcd5f0808e35f4f.jpg" width="369" height="500">

If you can get this right, you will have one of the best performing solutions out there! I just did 10km to work and speed, acceleration and hill climbing felt great! The brakes kept me from fully enjoying the ride though. A good reference point for braking would be the Koowheel D3M, which also utilizes a hub drive system and feels  super smooth and responsive over the full lower range.

EDIT: Still had 3 out of 4 bars on both the remote and board battery, so great first impression there!

OK so I've ridden the Landwheel for a little over 20km since yesterday. It kills me that I can not recommend the Landwheel in its current stage (as in: V4). The brakes are simply put super dangerous (I am not exaggerating here). Why does it kill me? Because performance wise it's a killer solution for a great price, although I can't say anything about long term durability of course.

- pretty smooth acceleration
- I got 12km out of it, so that's close to their specs
- super fast! Like.... dayum! 
- super steep hill climbing like a champ without slowing down (I am 84kg)

I wanted to shoot a video today but as it stands, it takes all my concentration to handle the breaks without causing an atomic explosion...

This is a perfect example of an "almost" great product. Shame really!

Well its definitely software, at least I think so. The problem is that we have no way of updating these drive systems ourselves, which is another missed chance.

At this stage I would not recommend Landwheel for commuting, which is only based on the poor brakes. Even though it's so close to being a great complete package :frowning: 

Landwheel: why don't you add a USB port to future versions so we can upload future Landwheel firmwarea to the board? It would save everyone so much hassle, time and shipping costs...

Hahahaha, The brakes and lack of full face helmet is why I haven't ridden the @Landwheel long range or shot a video. I need both my arms to balance or brace for a fall (and not brake my phone, camera or gimbal). The only flaw is the brakes at this point. Without good brakes I'm not going to go that fast. They posted a screenshot of a customer doing 28mph or so. I would only try that on a hill because it would naturally slow me down at the top.

Glad you gave Landwheel a chance, they are working on the brakes. I'm also excited that they are working on controlling two units with a single remote, I know @pkasanda was also looking to make a 4wd setup

Yes, this could be a total winner! They said they will keep me (and I am sure you as well) posted on developments regarding brakes etc.

I was also thinking 4WD before I even received the unit, but the way it pulled me al the way uphill without any noticeable performance drop was simply astounding....

Where else would you see the benefits of a 4WD solution?

Technotron:

Thanks for posting the V4 review.  Its very encouraging for most items. 

On the topic of the brakes, I've been corresponding privately with Jason from Landwheel.  We have exchanged a half dozen emails.  For some time, the Landwheel Team was very focused on fine-tuning the E-Brake.

That's changed.  Their programmers have now been tasked with reprogramming the boards to use reverse current for braking purposes.  Jason gave me an estimate of about a week for the reprogramming.

From my perspective, I think this is really good news.  E-brake functions by trying to magnetically trap the stator into a fixed position.  Jason's team now recognizes that this has a lot to do with the  Landwheel rider complaints about overly abrupt braking.

I'm very hopeful that the reverse current will produce some pretty nice braking.  As I've mentioned in prior posts, the boosted boards use reverse current for braking and those brakes are fantastic.

I also get the sense that Jason and his team are very grateful for all the feedback.

I don't speak for Landwheel.  I'm just an electric skateboard enthusiast who bought a bunch of V2 Landwheels.   I'm glad that Mike and yourself have added your voices to the topic of braking safety.

When you, Mike and I put our voices together,  collectively, we did get our message across.

Your really positive review on everything except braking,  plus Jason's commitment to a new braking strategy, suggest that a really good Landwheel may be just around the corner.

When I ask for my replacements, I'm very hopeful that I'll be getting some boards that are worth the wait.

Best Wishes from Canada

That's great to hear, PK! Really, really good news. I am hopeful I will receive a replacement pcb when the time comes. Could you let us know if you hear anything? Would it be OK to hook me up with Jason's e-mail address? I feel like I am having a hard time getting my ideas across to Monica. I definitely think it's a language barrier above everything else. 

Yesterday, Monica agreed that the brakes require some work and I think that's the general consensus. So we started talking about it earlier today and then, out of the blue, she basically starts telling me that the customers are fine with the brakes, as in: they know about it and still order the drive, so they must be OK with them. I go on to tell her that that's not really how things work and that the brakes simply do not suffice for safe commuting. Then this whole back and forth starts, and she basically ended up telling me that she believes I am simply under Mike's influence with regard to the brakes system (lol?).

I guess I am holding on to my Landwheel for now, although I am definitely getting a longboard deck to replace my current skateboard deck. It will at least make me feel a bit steadier on the Landwheel (although I am still pretty sure I'll do a proper superman before all of this is over :P).

Hi Techtronic:

I'll email Jason that you would like him to reach out to you.  However, I think you can relax about them not listening to you on the braking topic.  I know they were not understanding any of us for a long time.  We all saw that. That changed today. I'm very certain that our message has been received clearly and that they are on the right track to make this work the way the customers want it to work.

Also, since you are in the market for a longer board, here what I've been thinking about for my landwheels:

http://loadedboards.com/bhangra-longboard-skateboard
https://www.daddiesboardshop.com/longboards/decks-only/48in-and-up

Boosted boards uses the Loaded decks.  I like the ones with the kicks on both ends.

These are some nice bamboo boards that are complete, but cost less than the decks only from loaded.

http://www.tactics.com/completes/rs-44in,46in


These bamboo boards are half the price but slighlty shorter:

http://www.tactics.com/longboard-decks

And this one is an awesome looking 44" bamboo, also for half the price of loaded.

Also loved these but they are out of stock:

Jason,

That's great to hear. I think everyone, including Landwheel, will ultimately benefit from this approach :slight_smile: 

One more question: I noticed yesterday that towards the end of my batter, my drive beeped once and it felt as though throttle cut out completely for a sec. It was uphill, but I can't be a 100% sure. 
**Mike, Paul:** have you guys noticed anything like that while riding?

Hi Fred, 

For your question, we'd like to explain two points here: 

1.Battery protection: when you accelerate at low battery, if the battery voltage lower than 33V, it will beep alert and cut out for protection. 

2 Overcurrent protection: when you suddenly full speed on uphill, if the current is over 65A, it will alert and cut off to protect the board.

That's excellent to know, thanks for the response!

Perhaps it can be changed so that the motors slow down and not cut out completely? Because I literally fell off the board ;) (thank god it was uphill hehe).

Jason:

Techtronic's suggestion to reduce power instead of cutting power seems very important.  I don't have a V4 to test at this point.  However I don't need to be riding a board to agree that a power cut off can be very dangerous.  

Please bring this to the attention of your software programmers.  Techtronic seems to have done some very hard testing.  The recommendations that come out of that testing should be treated with the highest interest and priority.

My V3 beeped and cut out on me at a slight downward slope while I was holding a cup of hot coffee. foot braked and lost a bit of my black gold. I understand the need to protect the electronics due to over current, but 100% cut off is dangerous. Landwheel just needs to imagine this product with their loved ones on it to see the potential dangers. My car had a TPS Sensor that failed a few years back, when it fails, the car was limited to 25mph with extremely slow acceleration which is what they used as protection. Landwheel should go with that approach.

Bought a V4 from Monica, I agree with the brakes, it could be a software problem, it could also be hardware (the potentiometer in the controller may not have a lot of degrees of change on the brakes side). Ether way is there I way I can contact Jason and put my name on a list? If they update the board to fix this major issue, I don't mind swaping and resoldering the mainboard myself, as I wouldn't have the money to buy another booster from them.

Hi All,

New to the forum here. I've done about 100 miles now on a Landwheel and agree with some of the points listed above, mainly that the braking is too sensitive, but after some practise it's actually not too bad. If you throw you weight back and pop your leading hip a bit you can stop dead in a few meters.. it's pretty rad! 

Feel free to ask my any questions about it.

I must add though, that its INSANELY quick. I've clocked it at 43kph on gps while commuting to work in central London.

I've put it on a Loaded Icarus (Flex 1) and I tend to keep it in the slower mode.

It's not without it quicks though, at full speed on a less than full battery it cuts out to protect the battery, i'm not sure if this is the BMS cutting the power or the board, I suspect the board, but when you are leaning in counter the acceleration, immediate loss of power really get the adrenaline up and pants suitably soiled.

Very cool deck, been looking at a deck with some nice flex myself!
I think Landwheel has some great potential, with my only main grips being:

- brakes (a switch to reverse current braking a seems around the corner, as I will receive tracking for a new circuit board tomorrow)
- power cut off, as opposed to gradual power reduction. I have forwarded the information to Jason, not sure if he's read it yet.

Will keep you posted!

Edit: are there more budget friendly longboard decks with some nice flex out there? 😬

Edit 2: how did you mount the drive assembly through the drop through deck? Did you disassemble the drive first, mounted, then reconnect the motors?

@Landwheel Im sure if you solved the brake problem, a lot more people could be attracted to the product, if everything works as it should! Otherwise, it is a big risk to someone who would plan to resell these 'booster packs' .. due to dangers of using such product for consumers.

@Technotron Thanks for giving insight on how things are going on..

I like the general idea of 'attachable' esk8 drive / battery kit.. but the controller / bms issue does sound like a hazard :\

No worries, Jason has contacted me about their new circuit board revision with improved brakes over the entire lower range of the remote. They've sent me a unit and I will test it extensively once it arrives (and obviously share my thoughts with you).

Jason also told me he likes the idea of reduced power vs total cutoff, I am sure they will implement this too at some stage and keep us posted in the meantime.

I have to admit their responsiveness is second to none. They take us seriously and they really want to make it a much better product and improve their product.

As long as we handle them with care, they shouldn't be a problem. I like the higher C rating of lipos and the power they discharge compared to most li-ion batteries. Not saying they are better per se, but all these lithium batteries require some care... a certain risk is always involved.

Technotron:

Glad to hear you have a board upgrade en-route.  Two V4's should arrive for me this week with the e-Brake programming. Jason just gave me a tracking number for a replacement circuit board with the new brake programming.  I plan to do some side by side testing against my two boosted boards and perhaps get some drone footage.  I'm still curious if you are a lighter rider (under 200) or a heavier rider like myself and Mike.  I'm wondering if I should have my son do most of the testing for a few weeks before I subject the V4 to my own weight.

Welcome aboard.  Similar question.  45 Km/h.  Wow.  How much weight was on the board when you did that?

Cheers man, glad to hear yours are enroute. I myself am about 85kg, what's that.... a little under 200 pounds?

Just got confirmation from DHL that mine are in transit and should be delivered on Friday, so I am hoping to start testing in the weekend if the weather permits.

Technotron:
Thanks for the rider weight info.

All: 
So while we wait for the reprogrammed V4 boards, I'd like to  recap the various product improvement suggestions that have appeared recently in this forum, plus some of my own suggestions that I've pitched privately to Landwheel:

1)  Reduced Power instead of power cut-off to protect the battery (supported by all)

2) In concert with the reverse current for braking, I've proposed two items:
     a) Allow the brake to transition immediately from braking and into reverse allowing for operation similar to a boosted board.  Operationally, this is very useful for backing away from an intersection if you overshoot the white line.
     b) To protect the battery against overcharge during downhill braking, don't cut the power to the brakes (as is the case for a boosted board).  Instead, switch to a hybrid braking mode where one wheel uses e-braking at say max 55% power and the other wheel uses reverse current.  The E-brake should consume power to counteract the reverse current braking effect of forcing current into the battery -- With the objective of a net zero charge going into the battery and no loss of braking on a potentially dangerous slope.

3) I've proposed longer pivot bolts to allow for more adjustment of the trucks for tighter and more responsive steering.  Those suggestions were based on the V2.  I'm not sure if the bolt length increased for V3/V4.

4) Someone proposed upping the PU wheel diameter from 90 mm to 100 mm because there is not a lot of PU between the new larger diameter drive motors and the pavement.  I thought that was an amazing suggestion that could also improve the durability and do a great deal to reduce the motor failure rate on rougher roads with heavier riders.  I think the 100mm could be an optional upgrade with 90mm shipping by default to keep the base price in a sweet spot.

5) A number of posters have noted that the Landwheels have zero dust/water proofing for the circuit board and that this could be resolved with some strategically placed grommets and gaskets -- even a few beads of silicone at assembly time could protect the circuit board from the elements.  I'd like to see a battery overhang that squeezes a large o-ring between the underside of the battery overhang and the top surface of the chasis.  

Landwheel has had a pretty generous replacement policy.  For that to continue, better protection against the elements could save them an enormous amount of shipping and product replacement costs.  It would also be a huge boost to the reliability reputation of the relaunched V4.

Mike, Technotron, Navgor, Others:
Your thoughts?

Great suggestions right there, Paul!

1) Agreed!

2)  
a) Sounds useful, although I rarely ever use reverse. I honestly don't see any downside to this if the transition is smooth.
    b) This would be great in theory, but it would also require some serious testing in order to get the balance with the applied e-brake.

3) They still seem pretty short, longer would indeed be better.

4) This is most definitely on my most-wanted list and something I was thinking to myself roughly 30 kilometers into using the drive. I just don't see how the think PU layer will hold up much longer. The edges are already starting to chip off, thicker PU through different wheel diameter options would be more than welcome. Additionally, but not nearly as important: add a few color options, or at least add black PU as an option. Black goes with pretty much everything :slight_smile:

5) Isn't it supposed to be water/dust proof, at least to some extent? I think the manual mentioned this... I have no clue though. Definitely some really great additions you mentioned there!

Hi Technotron:

My water/dust resistant observations were based on the V2 which was described as waterproof but was wide open to water and dust.  When you swap your board, please take pictures of any dust/dirt on the board so that these can be shared with Jason.

have zero dust/water proofing for the circuit board
[/quote]

So far all the plastic panel over the circuit board on my drives has cracks on them. I don't over tighten any of them, that plastic is just too weak. My V3 came with cracks on them. So no amount of sealant would help if the plastic doesn't hold up.

honestly I don't care for waterproofing as water and skating don't  work well together anyway, but over time, dust would be a problem

Good point on the circuit board cover Mike.  The ABS is extremely brittle.  I think an aluminum cover plate would be far more effective and durable.  

I'll be more specific on my dust/water concerns. I'm not asking to go boarding in a thunderstorm.  This is more about routine contact with dust and incidental contact with some moisture one the road. 

The opening for the wires is wide open.  There is no rubber boot, seal or grommet.  Dust from the wheels shoots directly at the opening which sends dust straight into the circuit board compartment and even more directly at the back side of the battery contacts.  If you hit a moist spot on the road then moisture and dust both get fired into the compartment.  Just one splash frm an unexpected puddle could coat the back side of the battery contacts with droplets.   Its a short circuit risk.

I've seen plenty of dust migrate around the battery and coat the entire battery bay. similarly, I've seen substantial dust on the circuit board.

I noticed these dust problems with the hybrid board that I built using a broken V2 --replacing the hub motors with gear driven 6355's from DIY electric.

To be fair, the dust was actually the early spring road salt and the salt did more damage to the motors than the circuit board.  My point is that there are many spaces for dust/moisture to enter.  It might happen in one day in unfair conditions like road salt,  or over a few months in favorable conditions.

I think the three of us agree that dust/moisture resistance is important.  

Also, the Landwheel literature claims that the landwheel is  

"Dual brushless in-wheel motor-2*1100w, water and dust proof  (IP65)". 

and 

"Newest waterproof wireless remote control electric skateboard original from Landwheel" 

If customers think that the unit is designed for wet roads and they use it for that purpose then the outcome will be costly in terms of warranty replacements and reputation.

Yes, I informed Jason and also sent him a picture of dust accumulating behind the battery after every single ride. This could really end badly for unaware customers.

I also forwarded him this of idea of implementing a USB port in the next drive revision. Either on the side with a rubber seal of sorts, or behind the battery (which will hopefully be truly IP65 in the future). The benefits should be clear for both Landwheel and their customers: faster implementation of new (proprietary) software/firmware updates with new functionality, reduced shipping and replacement parts... I think it would be a small thing to implement but huge for customers and serviceability.
```

## \#47 Posted by: pkasanda Posted at: 2017-06-29T16:12:21.222Z Reads: 136

```
Agreed.  On both points.

Also, note that the dust infiltration into the battery cavity gives only a hint of what is happening inside the electronics compartment.  The infiltration happens from all directction.  From the battery compartment.  From the motor wire portal, even from the back side of the landwheel around the entire perimeter of the neoprene pad.  Be sure to take some pictures for Jason when you swap your board.

An alternative to the USB port might be a bluetooth connection to a phone app.
```

## \#48 Posted by: Technotron Posted at: 2017-06-30T18:57:29.708Z Reads: 147

```
Bluetooth would be a great alternative and definitely solves the waterproofing issue for that particular port. As long as Bluetooth works reliably (which I think is still an issue at times).

OK so I received my revised circuit board today. I replaced the board, put the lid back on, put the first screw back in and... yup, cracked the lid on one corner. The plastic is definitely too brittle. I agree that a metal lid would be better, they would have to insulate the bottom though with some coating or rubber because of the circuit board underneath.

So the big elephant in the room. Brakes. Right? The gist of it: they work better, definitely not as harsh and sudden at lower speeds. At higher speeds, I still find them a bit too strong and not gradual enough, but they are usable. I think they are a step in the right direction and will be usable with more practice. I am very interested to hear what Mike and Pkasanda have to say about them, I obviously have to test them more thoroughly for a final conclusion.

I had a similar issue. It might be that your on/off button on the motor/battery module is stuck on?

I just modded mine with a waterproof push to make button and even put an o-ring between it and the casing.

Not sure about more budget decks, my opinion is that you should not cheap out on the deck. I tried 10 different ones and the Icarus just felt amazing, I get on it every day and know that I made the right choice. If all my electronics go to shit I've still got a weapon of a board which holds it second hand value too.

While this is a drop through deck I didn't mount in that way, just the normal way. No disassembly required although that's a mod I'd like to try at some point, but that would require some pretty lengthy modding, at that stage I'd use a whole new motor/ VESC/ battery setup.

+1 longer kingpin bolts!

100mm-110 mm wheels would be delicious. It would also increase the top speed in low speed mode pretty much negating the need to use the higher speed mode, which is just straight up crazy - mainly due to the way it cuts the power randomly (I've yet to work out if it's a component overheating or battery BMS cutting back)

As for braking, I should add that after lots of testing I much prefer the handling of the drive when it's front mounted but the braking really is quite scary even though I've got pretty good at it. In rear wheel drive configuration hard braking causes a little bit of slipping which reduces the severity thus making it more controlled.

The real issue for me with the braking is the delay. When you know you need to brake its all good, but when a car door opens in your face the delay is the difference between your board braking or your bones.

Technotron:

If you have not shipped back your unit yet, please try an experiment for me.  
1) Disconnect the three motor wires from the left motor.  Insert the battery on an angle and see if the right motor works.
2)  Try the same experiment with the right motor.
3) If one of the above experiments results in a working single motor land wheel, then reassemble the battery cover plate and take it for a careful test ride.
4) If you don't have a working landwheel from experiment 1 or 2, then repeat them but also disconnect the corresponding hall sensor wires.

If you are successful with the above experiment, tell me what you think of the brakes on a single motor landwheel.  Tell me if you get different results with the original circuit board vs. the reprogrammed circuit board.

Does the remote has 2 button control for safety reason ?

1 for speed and 1 for safety button that we have to continue push so if we accidentally fall, the board will stop running with speed.

I prefer a remote that we can grip like a pistol, do you have any difficulties controlling the speed and the brake system using that remote model ?

I paid a little over $400 when they are selling V1. The first unit they sent me was V2, then I got V3 and now V4. It's been over a year now, so I would say hold off on buying unless you want to become one of their beta testers like us. at this point I'm pretty much waiting for PK and Technotron to test and let us know it's ready because I'm tired of going slow because I fear the fall the LW causes.

for testing, I pretty much just do up and down a street with a full face helmet. The braking issues stopped me from doing long distances.

Hi, I just upgraded the motherboard myself on the V4, to upgrade the braking system. I had a problem where after I upgraded I was going up a slight slow (5% grade) for about 400meters, with a few stop signs, so I was going full power and braking hard and going full power, and at the end when I was accelerating after a stop sign the board just stopped and threw me off. I'm curious what would be the first step for diagnosing this issue. Should I bring a IR temp gauge with me to check the motors? should I look for connectivity problems? The board still kept working fine all the way back home, but I stopped pushing it hard. I was wondering if you knew in what situation the board would lock up the brakes like that.

Thanks

Hey guys,

I just got my landwheel yesterday and it was great and all. But after a 5km+ ride around. I came home and realised that there is now a rattling sound coming from 1 of the motors. Any ideas on what may be causing this?

Facts:
Max speed during journey was 30km/h
Went up some slopes
Journey lasted 5km+
No rattling sound when I pick up the board and shook it. (Nothing loose inside?)
Sound only present when the motor is running (wheel turning)
Sound only present on 1 side
I don't think the axle is bent since it's not wobbling when the wheel is spinning

I've just purchased the drive. I hope to see great improvements in the future from this company. I was thinking about the onan x2 before deciding on the landwheel purchase, but after gathering some information about their hardware durability, I changed my mind. On the other hand, mellow is just too expensive, it'll just make me feel like riding my track instead. Giving landwheel a shot may just be a highly anticipated risk, but I have a soft spot for companies that thrive on their customer service; making their product have a potential status. Will update once I test out the drive, thanks for providing great information on this thread and the original landwheel thread.

I got a refund on the Landwheel drive because I decided to go diy. I did not test out the system, I asked for a refund before shipment as I changed my mind. The product needs improvement from what I have read about it. I do hope all goes well for the Landwheel team because they're definitely one of a kind. Customer service is still outstanding for me, for all the b.s. they dealt with while I was undecided. Even after the purchase was made, they continued to resolve my payment. Like no other company I have came across, these guys truly do a outstanding job being a honest company. I would still love to have myself a boosted drive like the Landwheel to attach a board of my choice onto it. Once the Landwheel have resolved all their current issues, it'll definitely be a good purchase!

Hi guys,

I've been using my v4 for a while and I have noticed a couple of things. Aside from the braking issue, which is indeed way too strong and it seems to only have one "strength".

In fast mode, when I accelerate too much too fast, the board cuts out and throws me off. I wish the board would just have a set max acceleration and that's it.

I've also noticed that on a full battery I can take it full speed (which is insane) but after a few kilometers, 3 maybe, the board cuts out at top speed and I coast until I let go of the throttle completely and accelerate again. As the battery goes down, that cut out speed also goes down. Meaning if I only have one "bar" left, I can probably just throttle 50% before it cuts out. I know it's a voltage thing but is the drive's tolerance too low or is it the batteries?(I have 2)

Are you guys also experiencing the same thing?

I agree with @Ezekiel28-17. I have experienced the same top speed/acceleration limitations at around half the battery level. It seems like the board refuses to accelerate once my battery indicator starts to blink at the 2nd light, just before the red one. Which is roughly after 7km worth of skating. 
I wonder if this is because the drive is trying to save battery life??

V4 is crap now, We are all looking at "V5" replacement.

these V numbers are named by us, the customers. To Landwheel, the product is really only called L3 and the latest will be L3-X which is what we are calling V5

The history of their failures are:

V1 - Melting phase wires
V2 - Melting and shorting battery connection (arcing)
V3 - Beep of Death (for me at least) board stops and just beeeeeps until a reboot
V4 - Harsh brakes and low battery life, their safety feature cuts off the board at 50% battery life giving us only a 3 mile range
V5 - Supposedly fixes the above issues and also provide thicker wheels

It's hard not to lose faith when a board constantly tries to kill you! One version somewhere between V3 and V4 had brakes that went from 0% to 100%, it was either go or stop. The current V4 that's out does something like 0% - 20% - 60% - 100% so it jolts from one point to the next. The V5 is supposed to smooth out that braking jolt.

Their customer service and promise to provide us with a better improved product is great though, it is just frustrating paying for two units over a year ago and just haven't had anything really usable so far

Mike:

I think each person in this forum should contact the rep that they purchased from and document the specific problems that the are having.  Instead of requesting an immediate replacement…request a replacement to be authorized for when the specified problems are resolved in the V5 (aka L3-X).

For those of you that have a Landwheel V3 or V4,  Mike and I can share some early signals that there is good news around the corner.  Mike and I have worked with Landwheel to assemble a team of beta testers around the world to evaluate the Landwheels and make recommendations for improvements.  Landwheel has been extremely responsive.  So much so that I think it is fair to say they have incorporated every single suggestion thus far.  The beta team includes a combination of riders who are light/heavy, expert riders/novice, long distance/short, rough/smooth road conditions.  We were also fortunate to have several experts in in battery management systems.

This team ran the V4a, V4b, and V4c through test rides where we measured both range and battery voltage at each power down. 

In response to the extensive testing and feedback, landwheel has incorporated the following improvements into what they are calling the L3-X.

The beta test team expects to start receiving samples soon.  So we can't yet comment on how effective the changes are.  Landwheel has shared with us what to expect.  This includes:
1) Entirely new circuit board, waterproof, encased in resin.  The limitation is that the battery connection is not waterproof.  So while the circuit board is protected from dust and moisture, the absence of a waterproof battery connection means this is not a waterproof unit.
2) The thickness of the PU has been increased significantly and the grade of PU has been improved.  This should reduce vibration.  In turn this should, reduce stress on the motors, axles, electronics and the riders ankle and joints.
3) The replacement of the circuit board and the remote is intended to provide more progressive braking to overcome the risk of heavy riders being unable to maintain footing while braking.
4) The battery has completely new BMS.  My understanding is that this should increase range and provide improved power down behavior.  I believe that they may have also increased the battery capacity.  I'm speculating a bit on the last point.  I only know that that the L3-X runs on a different battery.  I'm speculating the capacity has increased because I believe the beta test team was successful in convincing Land wheel that V4 battery capacity was a limitation. The L3 X also requires a different charger.  This further supports my speculation that the battery capacity or voltage has increased.

5) I have been told that the tab that holds the battery in place has also been strengthened to better cope with potential sheer forces when riding over bumps.

I hope the above news provides everyone in this forum with some hope.  The thing to do now is not to request an immediate replacement but to document your basis for an eventual replacement with a newer version.  Contact your reps for this.

Keep in mind that Chinese companies have a separation of responsibilities.  The reps, (who are not employees of the manufacturers) are incented to ship units and don’t really know if issues have been resolved.  They also lack the authority to tell a customer that they might be better off waiting for a later release of the product.  So if you have a Landwheel and it’s broken, my recommendation is don’t burn a free replacement until you have convincing evidence that all the issues are resolved.  Mike and I can return to this forum to advise you of when the beta team has reached this conclusion.

As with most things, a cup that is half empty is also half full.  You may have purchased a unit from Landwheel and it may have already broken or may not be working to your satisfaction.  That’s not all bad.  The price you paid is likely much lower than what the perfected product will cost.  From what Mike and I have seen, the company has a generous replacement policy so it is very unlikely that any one of you will be disappointed at the finish line.
The way I look at it, every electric skateboard is a gamble.  For example, I purchase a boosted board G1 then waited almost a year for it to show up.  Same story with the G2 boosted board and my Onewheel.  I’ve waited for well over a year for my high capacity G2 battery and it’s still being delayed. I’ve tried building a few DIY boards but mostly, I’ve fried Vescs and switches. While I never purchased a Raptor, I understand there were many delays and early shipments had problems.
What ever you might say about the Landwheels that broke, everyone seems to agree that Landwheel is very ethical about replacements and is working towards building a solid brand reputation.
I’d like to conclude with a few hints about what might be the shortcomings in your V4’s.  I’ll do this because some in the forum were wondering if certain issues were unique to just their units.  

There were three different versions of the V4.  The beta team called them V4a, V4b, and V4c.
V4a:  Over powered brakes.  Circuit boards tended to fail. PU Wheels wore out
V4b: Brakes slightly improved for lighter riders but still far too powerful for heavier riders.  Circuit boards tended to fail. Sudden power cut-off when climbing hills or near end of battery range. PU Wheels wore out.  Lighter riders rode these units very successfully but were fearful of the shut downs and sudden brake force
V4c: This version saw the introduction of a graceful power reduction instead of power off behavior when climbing hills.  Unfortunately, the range of the unit dropped to just a few kilometers, sometimes less.  The brakes were changed again.  Some lighter riders liked the reduction in brake force but noticed a significant one or two second delay in brake activation.  Heavier riders still could not stay on the board.  PU wheels wore out.  The Circuit board had a near zero failure rate.  Lighter riders rode these units very successfully (except for range).  

So my advice is to report the issues that affect your unit and kindly request to get in line for an eventual replacement.

Mike and I will keep you posted on L3-X testing outcomes.

Thanks

@Johno & @n_j_a_s:

You asked about the right time to buy a Landwheel.  Someone recently contacted me privately to ask the same questions.  I outlined the strengths and weaknesses and suggested he either A) wait for some L3-X testing results or B) order now but specify not to ship until the L3-X is proven.  He chose option B and told me that Landwheel did take his order in that format.  I think he understood it’s still a gamble but that he might save money relative to the eventual cost of a perfected unit.  So you could negotiate with a Landwheel rep to see if you can get a lower price now for pre-ordering and perhaps an assurance of a refund if the L3-X is less than promised. Mike and I have dealt with the same reps ( Eileen & Michelle).  Message Mike or Iprivately and we can provide an email address.  I think there are a lot of different landwheel reps out there.   I think our reps were pretty flexible.  The two of you might also consider putting your two orders together to get a better price.  I don’t know if that would work.  It’s just a guess.  My initial order was for 6.  Mike ordered 2.  Sometimes quantity gets you a better deal.

The Landwheel is something I will keep an eye on, but for now I think I will be going for a self build. I've weighed up my options and I think that's the best route for me at the moment. I am keen to try out a ready to run unit at some point and if V5/ L3-X revolves the issues with the V4 then I will pick one up.

Hey, guys

I bought only new 92mm wheel for hub motor.
It feels good to run on a rough road.

But it could not be installed in V3. Can be installed only on V4.
The V3 hub motor seems to be slightly larger than V4.

*My V4 is a 0-100% brake model so long distances are scary and I can not run.

THANKS! this info is hard to find...

im wondering if the axle nut plays a major role... because i want to use my mini trucks with the square part of the hanger... the axles actually are female threaded on the inside of the axle and take a bolt that screws into the ends of the axle... the bolt has a wide cap that holds the hub wheel on...

this also begs the question if the landwheel hubs could just be used without that black cap... or is that structurally essential

The urethane is held on by four screw BEHIND the plates so I guess technically you don’t need the cap? No idea. Take a look at this pic. It’s an old V4 I have under my desk at work, the bearing exposure might be a concern.

SWEET...

TBH i only wouldnt use the cap because i assumed the axle would be too long... but it looks like the nut is extremely recessed inside the wheel... so a shorter axle would work... luckily i can make any truck i want becuase the square locking peice is easy to do and i could just experiment with a shorter axle truck... or whatever i end up doing

bearing exposure is fine... but exposure of the magnets would cause big problems eventually... 

but it lookss that black diamond shape is some kind of hole exposing the a magnets and stuff.. or is that just some kind of black stuff on that secondary plate attatched to the bearing and urethane

exactly what is your goal here? looking for a new drive just to take off the motors? why not get the newest one which we have confirmed to be good?

The older versions are plagued with problems within the ESC, but the motors themselves are fine. It has been mentioned that the sensor wires are in an unknown order and vescs were potentially blown due to that so best to run them sensorless?

then get the NEW one with black wheels that are called L3-X, stay the hell away from the orange wheeled death machines.

However I would suggest you hold off on ordering one at the moment since they are working out a part to strengthen the housing. The L3-X battery is slightly heavier and there have been reports of the battery pulling the housing apart. If you don't want to wait, a velcro cinch strap would also work to distribute the weight pull to the metal frame instead of the plastic housing.

Hey, i've had the L3X for a while now and its my go to board.  best remote by a long way, best performance of anything in its price range by a long way, range is not great though but with the batteries being reasonably cheap that is not an issue. the only thing that bugs me is its tendency to cut out under pressure.  I can go out fully charged and it will cut out on a slight incline at full whack every time.  You have to turn off and restart to get it going again.  Bit frustrating but the buzz makes up for it.  I believe its a safety issue that is programmed in and @Landwheel if you want some constructive criticism, change that and make the trucks wider this board needs to be low and wide its too fast to be up in the clouds with narrow trucks. still my favourite though.
Thanks

if you want to go up steeper hill with the landwheel, don't go full throttle. Instead, try to build up some speed before the hill if you can and keep the throttle around 3/4 of the way up. I have been able to go up pretty steep hills by doing this. Although it will definitely not be going super fast, you will make it up the hill (at least I have and I weight around 190 lbs). When going up a hill and nailing down the throttle 100% you are pulling too hard on the battery which is too small to handle that kind of draw, which causes the voltage to sag which then triggers the low battery cutoff on the ESC. 

**TL; DR: To go up hills on a landwheel, limit the throttle to abbout 3/4 of the way up instead of trying to floor it**

Hi guys 

Hopefully, someone could advise me on this issue.
So, I was riding around and at some point, I made a slow turn in which the wheel made a small impact on an edge of the curb.

Since then, in this hub motor, the rattle is presented.

Took it apart checked two bearing and one of them seems to not be aligned. Swap for a new bearing, unfortunately, nothing has changed.

In the video attached, you can hear and see what happens 
I really would like to sort this out and jump back to riding it.
