You were still trying to put 4 longboard wheels on them, huh?

China knows longboards should only have 2 longboard wheels and 1 longboard truck.  It's the way of the future.  Cost above everything else.  Doesn't matter if it only lasts 14 seconds.  It was fucking cheaper!!!

Try sending a PM to @hyperIon1 once you know what all you want in a battery (size, shape, bms charge only or discharge too, charger desired, etc)

12s4p pack should be right in the $400 ballpark minus charger

I expect that would depend on the brand.  Most of them give the enclosures away with the esc or battery.  They want it to be completely plug and play for the consumer.  The last one I bought not only had the enclosure and foam pad, it had adapters from banana plugs to mr30,s in there because of the upgraded hobbywing esc.  This makes me think that the business model is volume not spare parts.  No one makes money in spare parts until the market is saturated.  Those ae guys sound like westerners cashing in on chinese prices and oem but missing the point.

The cells for that would be $240 right now plus shipping, BMS and charger is another $150

This is why i'm looking into building small connectible p-group modules so that people can just build their own packs. Unless you are buying 1000s of chargers and cells and BMSs at once, packs are expensive.
