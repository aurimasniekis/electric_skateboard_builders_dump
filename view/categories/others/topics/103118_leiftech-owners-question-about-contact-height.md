Hi there,
as Leiftech deleted everything linked to their first product to launch the new one, I can't find anymore what is the height needed between the contacts and the PCB.
(see the red arrow on the pic)

I can't remember.
Was it 5 mm?
Thanks for you help.

There is "summerboard private group" on facebook, recently there was video from owner (Aaron) about servicing those contacts. Try with that

Excellent, this is exactly the video I was looking for (it was the one available on Leiftech forum).
Thanks man. :grinning:

I know they changed the value later to higher measure, but this one is good enough for me.
