Anyone seen this guy? Looks like we can get a 4kw hub motors 42v battery and carbon deck for $45 shipped. Why are we buying overpriced enertion raptors with this on the market?? I mean, my wheels cost more than the whole board??

It is mainly a Enertion Video Remake and even with a bit of the evolve Video at the end.
Totally scam. I think they wont even ship anything. 

When they only would ship the Deck they would make loss.

If they actually deliver anything, did you think it's gonna even be close to what they said it would be? Or even work for more than a couple days before breaking? These are already problems with cheap boards that you'd pay full price for to begin with. Don't be jelly, bro. :wink:

This is scam guys. I see this type of stores poping up more frequently last few months. Anyone ordering this be ready to call your bank and ask for a chargeback. You will never get anything.
