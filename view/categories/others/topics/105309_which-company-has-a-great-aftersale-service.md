Hi guys, Iâ€™m currently searching to buy a new esk8 after my really bad experience with a dyieboard.com kit. 
I would like a company with good aftersale service just to avoid all the trouble I had with my previous purchase. 
Any company you would like to recommend me knowing I live in Europe?

No problem. However you would get more proper responses if you specified your requirements, budget etc.
Also go to https://forum./
You will find a lot more people there to answer your questions.

If you don't want to do diy and just want to buy a board, go with backfire. Best mid tier eskate brand. I've had meepo, evolve, and backfire, personally recommend backfire.

Thanks! Backfire seems to have really nice product but I wanted a smaller board, do you think I could just basically buy the G2 or G3 and just swap the deck ?

Their mini is pretty good, otherwise I'd recommend the g3. I've never done a deck swap but it's possible for sure.
