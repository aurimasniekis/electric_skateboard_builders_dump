Are you feeling sad now that Christmas is over? Do you need something to cheer you up? Read this crowdfunding from someone who admitted to never having built a board yet feels ‚Äúvery qualified‚Äù to build them. He‚Äôs going to build a ‚Äúpremium board for the budget market‚Äù. Cause that‚Äôs possible. Send him your money now! (Sarcasm).

Thankfully so far no one has donated, but if does get any monetary support, we should be careful, could have an AlexTech 2.0 on our hands.

Oh my goodness.  I have to mirror this here for inevitably when this crashes and burns and gets taken down:

```What makes you qualified to do this?
For about 3 years now I've been really into the electric skateboarding scene but I never had enough money to afford any of the boards that were available on the market. I didn't think I'd ever be able to manufacture my own electric skateboard but then I thought why not? I'm very up for this huge challenge and I'm going to stop at nothing to be able to achieve it! With that mindset, I don't see why I'm not qualified to start manufacturing my own electric skateboard.```

He doesn't see why...yet just enunciated why

And I'll add this

`The board will have 2 150w motors which will not only allow it to reach speeds of 20mph but it will accelerate to these speeds very quickly.`

Maybe he accidentally put a space between the 2 and 150w for motor wattage.

Couldn't help but notice that you can only post comments and questions on their page if you're already a backer. I'm sure that's just a coincidence...

I'm surprised this hasn't raised any funds yet.  Clearly this is such a good deal -- I'm just waiting for funds then I'll probably be snagging about fifteen of them

250 pounds thank you
2000 pounds 2 boards...
They do not offer just one board at a reasonable price. I didn't even read the specs but I doubt this is gonna work.

any one can offer to build and charge money in reward but you do need a qualified
electrician to sign off on the wiring and he needs to test all circuits.If you dont have all this i place and lets say the board goes on fire kills or burns down a house its lands on your door step.

I doubt even that. As far as I can tell he hasn't even built/bought a board or anything yet. And he says he is "very qualified" :joy:
