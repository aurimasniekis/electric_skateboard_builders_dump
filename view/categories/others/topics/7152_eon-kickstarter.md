I think it's especially impressive how they managed to fit such a large number of cells, the BMS, and the ESC all into such a small package. Wonder if they use the VESC :smile:

I think they mean "first modular"

I'm pretty sure the guys behind this are on the forum..

10 batteries?!  This thing is so under-powered, even if it did have two motors.  1000watts my ass.  make a good video and fill it with bull and put it on Kickstarter

Marketing crap.  The best marketing video we could do is to buy this and every other commercial board and crush them going up hills.  I don't believe this thing could do the grade it even says.  If these guys are in SF I'd like to see if they have the confidence to meet and compare. Doubt it.  
 If we did a video and compared and that simply was the Kickstarter video maybe people would understand
I'm going to contact them and see if they're still here and will come out.

for the record, their packs have the same 99Wh as Boosted's which means at best the 2-pack unit is 198Wh. Those hubtors and their secret "OFOC" VESC sauce better pretty special. As @Hummie points out, marketing is easy. Proving it is another thing altogether. We just need some super-nerd genius to come up with a super-tits battery pack and we'll all be saved. Calling all super nerds....

As stated, I remain skeptical. Here's the specs from their site:

99 Wh Lithium-ion cells (10S - 37 V)  
Meets IATA air travel regulations and includes a travel safety bag
Charge time at 2A = 75min  
Swappable: UNLIMITED range!

I wonder what those cells are.  One set in series none parallel...either they will destroy the cells with any kind of a hill or it has extremely low amp limit and won't go up the hill or go so slow the motor melts the rubber. .  I'd like to see them try to go up some hills and take some temp readings.  One small motor, so small you can even bolt the truck nut on...it pisses me off when people make a killing selling super weak stuff with bogus claims.

THE BIG QUESTION IS... how long until their hub motor becomes available to buy from the factory (on aliexpress etc)... people throwing shade on it probably didnt even watch the video long enough to descipher that THE HUB MOTOR MOUNTS ONTO ANY TRUCK... i guess theyve designed it to have the stator somehow grip onto a circular shaped axle... also there is a little sleeve thingy that slips pretty far over most cylindrical shaped hangers... probably because the axle most likely isnt long enough for the wider hub motors and are disgned for regular wheels that dip in on both sides... the video has a bunch of engineer dudes on solidworks designing the motor so im assuming that this is some kind of original design they are collaborating with the factory on... 

do these types of hub motor mounts already exist? the only ones i have seen have some kind of square hole that holds them in place... or have some kind of flange bracket that bolts onto the stator... 

 because i would LOVE to do a diy build with dual hub motors of this type that can just slide onto my super 210mm wide "Tracker" trucks... and then spec out the proper esc and battery to go with everyhing...

everyone is so quick to exclaim "oh great another mellow rebrand" meanwhile did you look close enough to see that its impossible that they got it from the same factory becasue the motor is mounted in an entirely different way... this goes for landwheel, onan, etc as well....  completely different hub motor than mellow just based on the immedately visible fact of how its mounted let alone if you opened it up to discover theyre not the same... mellow is also only produced in germany..

so if anything its a ripoff of the IDEA of selling just the drive train... which isnt really illegal or a patentable idea... just because mellow was the first to do it... btw... mellow is $1700+ and not better than a raptor 2 so wtf is with all the mellow dick sucking on this forum
