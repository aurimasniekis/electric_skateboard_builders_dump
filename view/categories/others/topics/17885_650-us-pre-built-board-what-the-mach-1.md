 Okay! Now brief introductions who dont know me, im Alex, Owner of www.aatorquesystems.com and create the best value Electric Long boards out there! (Its a opinion :smiley: )

Now the next thing to be released by me would the "Mach 1" the more economical version of the "Mach 1 Elite" Which i have gotten amazing support from the community by the way! Now im trying to hit a market that many E-Builders and Esk8 Companies i feel have not covered enough, the Value Board! The "Mach 1" Is (what im hoping to ) Going to cover that gap. Beacuse in [False Economy](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/are-diy-electric-skateboards-cheaper-the-false-economy/165) Thread is seems that DIY way can have it issues from really saving money, From cost of tools, to even user error. Since seeing this i have been trying to find the way of making a sub $700 Board that kick butt! We are now for sale at www.aatorquesystems.com  



SPECS: 

Mach 1 7Ply Canadian Maplewood Deck. 
6365 Motor 3000w 200KV
10s2p 6Ah, or upgrade for a 9AH 
15t to 36t Pulley kit 15MM 255mm Belt  
50 Degree Caliber stle truck. 
90mm Black 83A Wheels 
Vacumm Formed Enclosures 3/16
Vesc (With the Extra Caps) 
Legacy Off/On Switch For reliability. 
42v 45a BMS 
42v 2a Charger
Loaded Hardware 

The feel of the deck Is great, thanks to much time and work, we gave our decks some flex to it. Allowing for some absorption of any less then ideal roads. This Longboard was the solution to not having to buy anymore Chinese Crap boards. We are using parts I have used personally and I'm a big guy (220lb) so you know they will work with you. You will start seeing the reviews showing up on the boards anytime now. Everyone who has got there's is just in love with the torque and overall feel for the board. 

New Boards will be shipped out with the new deck, due to Wheel clearance from the drop through.

This is hundreds od times better than that first one couple month ago. Really love that drop-thru deck! 

Do assemble motor/s back side of reae truck? Because i think that in front of rear truck motor is going to take hit due to low clearance.

Lord I would hope so :joy: 

They are mounted on the rear, This is due to you guessed it! Clearance, Like @Pantologist Said its like a Evolve Style without a evolve price tag.

@Alextech Looking good, man! I also like that deck, and the little forward arrow. Lol. Could your deck accommodate 90mm wheels without wheel bite becoming an issue? I'm trying to make 90's work on my new drop through for the smoother ride and it's a challenge. 

What kind of range and speed are you shooting for with this setup? If you want someone local to help test or ride with sometime, I live/work in the Santa Rosa area.

Im riding 97mm on them with some wheel bite, so 90's should be killer! Id love to get some people trying the board out so that can easily work out! Im getting close to 23mph and about 16miles on a 10s3p

90mm is a good size. You can also make wheel wells in the deck to use 97mm wheels.

Nice to see your progress with your commercial builds. You asked the community for constructive criticism, got it, and adapted without getting defensive or irritated.
Keep up the good work and best of luck to you!

This is a very cool vision (and setup). Perhaps a TRUE value board! For a serious rider, the value doesn't appear to be lacking where it counts most. Which is unique.

If you are mounting motors in the back, you should add good guards to protect it so the user can stand the board up without damaging the motors. I think that is one of the biggest flaws with Evolve boards.

That can be totally doable! The Difference is that people would have order the board first. I don't like the idea of 3D Prints. If I was to do this there would be a 1/4 off the mount as a Stainless steel plate. It would be more durable. Those who bought then without them would receive them in the mail and would be a screw on accessory.

if you are making custom motor mounts, you can make the motor end of the mount longer/fatter so the mount would sit on the ground then you wouldn't need an add on part....adding some grip/jimping pattern would be cool too

Oh Mike ! I can totally do that! And the motors sit closer to the wheel already leaving some from the floor. I think this is very plasuable to do.

what a cool option for folks!  Looks really good Alex - kudos.

Can you show your motor mount?  Assuming a single - do you have a dual motor option?  Also like the idea of the guard - add on or extended mount to let you prop it up w/o damaging the motor.

looks like an evolve killer!!

The mounts were are using are from the group buy from @JLabs  Yet, I am thinking of changing the design and finding a independent manufacturer so I don't have to clear out Jared out lol. 

 @sl33py Hells yeah you can do a dual motor! I made this system to be as modular as possible.  You can get a discount from buying from us if you want to upgrade to a dual rear later in the future.

For everyone interested, the first 5 Boards will be sold tonight at 10PM (PST) get your hands on the price of $650 with a 10s2p 6AH or $700 with the 10s3p 9AH. These boards will be shipped in 1.5weeks after payment and the sooner your order the faster it will arrive to you, I'm expecting to get most done in a week and will probably be done sooner then 1.5 weeks. So act fast, and go "Mach 1"

I'm definitely keeping this as an option. I'm one of those eboard newbs that don't want to blow money on a boosted board or get caught up with the Chinese boards. I'm not too tech savvy so not really interested in building one from scratch but I do consider myself the tinker type. Probably a stupid set of questions...but what type of charger does this come with ? And is there anyway to upgrade the remote? Oh and any sort of "warranty"? haha :laughing:

reading the specs/parts list, it is definitely something you can tinker with. To change the remote, it's just swapping out the stock receiver and plugging in new one and binding. There may be some VESC adjustment needed to properly control the motor, there are plenty of examples here.

Even though I have built a board and helped another person build one as well, it's definitely not a hard task, for me the hardest, well maybe scariest thing to do is building your own battery pack which is why I used Enertion's there are other's here who make and sell enclosures and battery packs so you can always reach out to them.

Thanks for the response. I've given it some thought but I'm clueless about how to connect all of the components into one system..I feel like some of you guys are electricians! I'll continue to do my research on building one from scratch and keep all of this in mind..my goal is to have a board by the summer.

Good to know! I was actually tempted to go buy a brand new koowheel off of craigslist for $500...but something was telling me to be patient. Yours looks like a lot more board for an extra $150 :relaxed:. Waiting to see some more reviews about the Mach 1 before I make a decision.
