Personally I think a remote would be more reliable and u have much more control over the speed.

yea... google the z-board

nobody wants remote free control, especially me. I like to shift my weight while keeping my speed the same, something that’s not possible on boards like this one

If I want remote free, I'd just get a longboard.

if fact, it's more easier than remote to control the speed, it's Gyro & Gravity sensor design, very sensitive on body  reaction, you can also check this max speed test video, the rider holds two iphones in each hand and ride it without any problem.

For me the problem With this design is if you need to press pads to accelerate brake. 

But if the board respond to the gravity and body movements that would be pretty cool. 
I mean wherever your foot is on the board if you lean fw/bw it will accelerate brake. If you shif your Weight on the side one wheell will spin faster than the other etc...,

thanks for your kind advise, i won't sell it here, just want to talk with electric skateboard fans about a new controlling system. i'm a pro e skateboard rider and i have a idea of remote-free controlling, but i still need your advise about it, it will help me learn more,thanks!

thanks for your comment, this is totally new design, don't need press pads in fact there is not pad in the board, it's gravity design and the i can control the speed, brake by my balance. you can check this video to see how it works.

Alright I see. 
It seems like a cool technology to me. 
But the WHOLE surface of the deck need to be weight sensitive. 
The good longboarders will often move their feets/ re scale the balance etc... like your technology need to not interfere with riding style and work with it. You really need some good riders data to study stance shift of balance etc... 

It’s a technology we could embrace it just need to be natural  and safe

One thing you need to know as well is that notlike beginners in longboard you don’t really use your feet to turn. You use your whole upper body to turn. You don’t use your toe or you backfeet.  
So sometime riders Will lean forward on the front side for turning, but it won’t mean the board has to accelerate you see ?

Really appreciate your opinion and kind advise, yes we are keeping improving it. the WHOLE surface of the deck is very weight sensitive. in fact we design it with controlling level changing with each 2kg balance difference.
the rider's feet can't leave the deck but they still can do some interesting action, maybe you can check this video

Well I have to admit it seems to be a promising technology if applied well. 
I don’t mean to be rude or whatever but something is ticking me about both your video, the guys displayed on those are obviously no longboarders and have no experience in stance and balance, it’s obvious. Be sure your board is extensively tested by legit and hardcore riders ( 20 to 50 km at least a day, it’s a commuting machine it has to be tested like it is ) 
You won’t convince anyone here with guys without helmet not able to have a correct stance... 

Do you have a beta rider program ?

Hands free ESK8 sounds like a hazard to me. If the board’s not breaking , and you need to foot stop, but having weight pressed forwards forces it to accelerate... you’re going to have a bad time. Not to mention they force a specific posture and foot stance. Nor do you have full control of your board as you would with a remote. I trust the hand - finger (is that even a thing ?) of my hands than my body.

very sensitive on body  reaction
[/quote]

This is the whole problem with it.
Acceleration and braking needs to be independent of foot placement and weight distribution. 

Thanks @GrecoMan for helping with the name Z-board. The original remote free Esk8. 
I just couldn’t remember the name.

Hey can you kick push the board with this ? What happens when you lift a foot while rolling ?

Edit : Both cool and worrying to see you test it on top of a building roof. And you really need a helmet dude.

Wow you're a pro. What "pro" e-sk8 competitions do you participate in? There aren't any as far as I know, but if someone knows of any please correct me. The closest thing to pro e-sk8 events is probably the Performance Days organized on this forum, and I don't recall seeing you at those. 

And now instead of replying to people you're just reposting the same picture. This reminds me of the skateboard stabilizer guy......

I think that's his point. Onewheel is the only board to do it well so far. In a sense, the entire deck is weight sensitive, as no matter where you have your feet or where you move them, the board can still respond to your movements and go forward or backward.

Yeah like @GrecoMan said, this was already done by z-board, and didn't really catch on.  I would never want to ride without a remote, I can't imagine the control system of feet being reliable enough

People have done it with sensors in the trucks to measure weight distribution and translating it to throttle input. The more you lean forward the more you accelerate.

There was a thread here not too long ago where university(?) students demonstrated their prototype. 
I'm personally not a fan(yet). Seems too dangerous to me..

I just don't see the reason for something like this. It isn't a big deal to hold a remote in my hand and it gives me much greater control over the board. That way if I ride sitting down, with 2 people on my board, etc. it doesn't matter, I still control it the same way. 
It's not like I need my hands free when riding either, I'm not about to pull out my phone and start texting while I ride.

Funny you post here, I was wondering how such a system would perform on your nkp boards. Cause you reach scary speeds, hold my beer I hope to catch up one day :beer: 

I kinda feel like there's a way to get this sorted out but not like done here. Sensors in the deck / trucks should not be used for throttle and braking, only for measuring applied forces. 

But hey the dud preferred posting a boastful picture instead of answering relevant questions like : can it be push kick, what happen if we lift a foot while rolling. Well it's doesn't matter anymore to me.

I enjoy any functional piece. When a person takes and builds a functional piece to me it's like mechanical art.. Though It may in my eyes in every way be impractical or even a dangerous idea, there is something from that function that has a place or purpose that can be used elsewhere.. @Just-Goo  people will buy it. In my eyes your idea is like taking gas and brake from a car and adapting them to your steering wheel.. will work ok when cruising slow and negotiating slight turns but when the real work needs done your not optimising your control functions.

some guys though my post was a advertising and voted me, so i rethink my post and try to understand the right way. I think i will do it better on my next post to talk about the electric skateboard, with more practical specification and data, not the way to make others feel it's a promotion.  


Meanwhile it's just a little difficult to make anyone to understand and accept this kind of new e board controlling, but i won't give it up, because i do love it, and i also got a new idea, i can make a new design for the controlling system which can offer the riders control it by Remote and also without remote. because i understand now(from those replies of my post) many riders do love remote at this moment. but i always hope there is something more than a remote control, and there are more people getting love electric skateboard.

Million dollar plan right there!!

Able to make it to school or work on time, or the liquor store before they close using the tried and true remote controller.

Then hands free mode so you can carry a case of beer with each hand, or two slurpees. Or juggle, or just pat your head and rub your belly. 



With all your riches, you can develop an electric skateboard controller system using facial muscles and rule the esk8 world.

The bigger the smile the faster it goes. 

When shit gets real, you know like when stuff in the danger manual happens... the eyelid and eyebrow sensors would know it, and apply a soft throttle back off, and progressive braking.
