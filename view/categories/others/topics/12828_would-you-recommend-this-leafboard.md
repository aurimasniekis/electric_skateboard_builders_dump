At this point, I personally wouldn't buy an off the shelf board until it's been tested by the public for a bit. I got and EGO and an Evolve off pre-order and had many issues with both. I got the EGO first and I had ESC, motor,  and remote failures in the early months. I was well taken care of by the company and eventually upgraded my board to the latest version at no charge after the warranty was out. The final result was a very reliable board that has given me zero issues, not even a dropped connection. With the Evolve I had major connection issues, a couple broken axles, poor construction, burned out a wheel, poor board quality... Evolve too was very helpful and took care of everything, but it was all still a bit of a pain.

I highly recommend both companies and their level of customer service was excellent, but growing pains are part of being an early adopter and if you're not ready for it, it can be sort of a pain. Going the DIY route isn't problem free, but you have the option of going with well tested parts not to mention a setup that is exactly what you want.

..and you can repair anything that breaks yourself without having to ship your board around the world a few times. Well said @Mrmoonlight

It seems a little disingenuous to claim that our forum "featured" Leafboard... it's more likely that it was discussed and identified as "probably not something any of us would buy."

They probably searched "leafboard" on google and reported every result. That tells a lot about the company. Just look at what they're advertising, 28% hills? 18,5 km range with a 5000 mah? Not even on 12s

You bring up a very good point. It helps to consider where you're purchasing from as well. Shipping costs and times can really add up. Not just when you first order something, but if you ever have to send something back for repair. If it's as whole board, that could get pricey. If it's just a VESC, it's not such a big deal. You may just have to wait awhile.

dude i was looking at the leafboard, but i backed out of it last minute. if u saw the comments on it, they lost like 70k or something cause they're just a sketchy company. a bunch of backers dug up evidence that they're associated with this 3d printer that still hasn't shipped out yet on kickstarter. there was a thing where leafboard said digitaltrends was going to write about them, but they never followed back up with them. they also said that they're based in walnut california, but i think they're just a company in china.

idk man, it's weird stuff. i didn't trust it. i was looking at everything and i decided to just go with acton, they look way more reliable for a similar price

4 months delayed but at least there is some work being done. It's gonna be a SPECAIL board.
(I'm not a backer)

This was posted in their closed FB-group for backers by the page admin.

Digging this thread back up because I'm bored at work. Press reset has done a video on this board and it looks to be revamped with the new hobbywing esc and oled remote like the exway.

2 years is still a LONG time to be shipping a product. Hopefully they've finally worked it all out.

I did in fact order this, and did in fact receive it, albeit after 2.5 months (stated shipping time 8-15 days..).  It came by rail once they had it finished, and was 30-35 days in transit from HK (I think)..
So far it's been good, light, and I've managed the top speed it states.  I haven't had the 12.4mile range they claim, more like 6, but I was gunning it about.  They responded to some FB messages saying riding in mode 2 (of 3) got about 10 miles

Ah Leafboard. My very first esk8. 

Its ok for a 70kg rider like me, and can go up some slight inclines with momentum from speed. It lasted a good 9 months before it 'broke' down on me. Not sure what happened but the remote does not respond to the board. The funny odd thing was also that the button makes a weird deep pitched squeak sound when i press the power button. 

Now don't get me wrong, this board is great, if you are looking for a perfect commuter board with reasonable power. It's also super water resistant. I had to ride it in the rain quite a few times and nothing happened to it, although i had to wipe it down when i got home. The board is an intergrated deck with a 3mm carbon fiber plate on top, which i kept after the board died because its useful material haha. 

I got it for 299 USD from the first kickstarter, worth it for that price if you ask me, but had to wait a year thats all

I have the leafboard plus (the new one with the hobbywing esc)

Still writing a review, but it's a fantastic short range portable board. Got 11.4mi maxed out in mode 2 on my test track. The small deck and wheels make it best for good condition roads and sidewalks with 2-4mi between breaks.
