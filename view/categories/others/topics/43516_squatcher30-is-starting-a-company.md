I am starting my own electric skateboard company and designing my own board/s. Are there any bluetooth remotes already out on the market, or is Evolve the only one who makes them?

No. I've been searching for quite a while and there aren't any companies that I can find that make a bluetooth transmitter that can be a DIY addition. There are only a few select board companies that make them for their own boards. The costs are crazy high, so I'm trying to see what I need to invest in.

no I mean about starting a company.  what are the specs of the board you are planning to produce?

Without shedding too much info, let's just say I'd be able to compete with the Evolve board and reach the market for at least $500 less than they are asking, yet provide many enhancements. I'm thinking we are gonna need to have our own remotes produced too.

if your planning on bluetooth for signal, forget it.  it will disconnect in populated areas

So 2.4ghz is actually a safer option? I own a Scramboard (Trampa board with dual 3,400w motors, 2 VESCs, Maytech etc. It goes 30mph). The signal drops out near intersections due to some type of signal coming from the streetlights.

yes dude. use 2.4ghz for comm and bluetooth ONLY for telemetry.  i think you need to do a bit more research before building and selling any boards.

My goal is to produce the highest quality e-board on the market for $1,500 or less. I have a team of people working for free for me. Don't count me out just yet. I want to make electric transportation a viable option. I never said I'm going to crush Evolve. They are a respectable company and they produce a great product. I am producing something ... new.

Why is a wired remote option such a bad idea? You wouldn't have to charge your remote and it's not like you're going to use the board when you're not on it, right? I've seen a few boards with wired remotes (cheap boards yes), but what's your opinions on that?

an idea I had was to have a wired connection that goes to the board and disconnects in the instance you go flying off the board for some reason, but that would be disastrous if the plug came undone somehow while going downhill. Idea scratched. I just researched 2.4ghz. Looks like the choice we are going with, along with bluetooth for telemetry. In the next year, I will launch our website and begin selling our boards. We promise to make them the safest, most reliable, and most convenient amongst all other options on the market. 

I appreciate the feedback. If you have any suggestions (stuff you wish other e-board companies would have done, we will take them into serious consideration)

With a wired remote, it would be fairly easy to get the cord tangled in the motor, wheel, or belt/pulleys.

Wait, you are planning to start up a company and make electrical things and you don't know that bluetooth can barely handle a wireless speaker when a person walks between phone and a speaker

Im recommending you an airlive wl  1700 usb antenna for wifi access without walls it claim to have a 25km radius of signal, make a wifi remote and you are safe

Perhaps you would be interested in my project at http://eboardshop.net/product/advanced-electric-skateboard-remote/ 
Its an advanced remote control made for the DIY community.
It has everything such as telemetry, reliable connection using FHSS, long range, multiple receivers support, front, back, and left/right signals, cruise control, adjustability, safety functions, and many more.

If you are going to make your own Bluetooth module for a remote, you might have to get the FCC certification. 2.4 GHz is way overpopulated.

@Squatcher30 I want you to read this thread: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/horrible-communication-by-alextech/25597/527 the most recent posts in particular.

This community has a newfound intolerance for those boasting about "companies" with big promises and no product or history to back it up. I encourage you do to great things, but also caution you to save the marketing language until you have something to show.

Right now, you seem about as legitimate as AA Torque Systems. Give yourself a chance to succeed by bringing innovation before you tell everyone how epically successful you are :slight_smile:

Out of curiosity, have you priced product liability insurance?  

I've been wondering that about all the "garage" electric skateshops out there.

For the same reason people want wireless mice on their computer.

Obviously, I frequently use my computer from another room and sometimes when I'm outside too I can still use it since the mouse is wireless.  No longer do I need to be right in front of it to use it.  I mean, the monitor and speakers don't work anymore from that far away, but who needs those.  I'd rather deal with my mouse having required cyclical maintenance instead of just always working.

Actually, not to distract this thread but I am needing a handful of 10s1p <99wh li-on batteries terminated xt60 to piggyback in order to fuel a eSk8 trip in Feb over seas.  Can I source those from you, and perchance they are 30Q or better or 25r?

I will add this to our PM thread so not hijack this thread.  Answer is immediate need w/BMS, longer terrm answer is clearly BMS independent. Given time pressure, easier to deal with builtin bms,  Right now relying on a couple of these LiGo batteries which are great but too expensive to buy a bunch of and throw in airline carryon lol..  http://www.ebikes.ca/product-info/ligo-batteries.html
