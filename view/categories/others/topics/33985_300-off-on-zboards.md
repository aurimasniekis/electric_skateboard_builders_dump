Free shipping too. I went ahead and ordered the 24 mile Pearl edition. I live on a nice smooth bike trail and it's about 6 miles into the city so the extra range will give me a comfortable buffer for the round trip.  https://www.zboardshop.com/pages/the-2017-summer-sale?utm_campaign=ss300-web&utm_medium=retargeting&utm_source=adroll 

After looking at many pre builts I came to the conclusion that they are overpriced. Some have pathetic range, lousy warranties and long wait times to ship.  The Metro Board looks to be a good value for what you get and this Zboard 2 Pearl @ $1199 shipped is very good.
