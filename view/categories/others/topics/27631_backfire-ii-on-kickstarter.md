Hi guys,
I have just found out about this board on Kickstarter. It does not look bad at all to me (but I'm no expert) and it sure looks cheaper or at least similarly expensive to a board I could build myself (I'm from Europe and I've found that components tend to cost a lot more here). 

Here is the video of a youtube trying it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9ZSGxPpq00&t=310s

Here is the link on Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1171416995/backfire-your-affordable-best-electric-skateboard

Let me know what you think :smiley:

Prob gonna "backfire" on you 

No real reviews. Looks like an updated "backfire" esk8 they had before... quality maybe not there, bad support...and tough to fix if broken....

There are better options out there

I thought that remote looked familiar.

**Backfire II - GALAXY**

Hey guys this is my current compilation of information regarding the Backfire II, nothing special just thought I would share what I have found for this budget board.
Current reviews

* [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etw-4OqePzk)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9ZSGxPpq00

Apparently the units for sale on [alibaba](http://backfireboards.com/https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/2017-New-Backfire-electric-skateboard-dual_60664998526.html) are sample unit which contains no water potting sealant, wheels which are the wrong tolerance because they are from the first 1000 batch and a whole host of other potential issues with battery life, I cannot confirm this but I would stick to buying them from [backfire](http://backfire) 

This[ reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/6nejfx/backfire_ii_galaxy_editioninitial_thoughts/) discussion has some info in it if you are looking for more context

Anyways I'll update this in the future, give me your thoughts of what you think.

This is not true after talking with them and getting certificate sent to me they wrote this.
"HUNANNI FUN was our distributor before,but recently  Their operation was cancelled
So they got angry and make some lie.
We are the only one who hold the BACKFIRE brand
We design ,we produce,we sell

Apparently they're going on Indiegogo for the same price ($ 399) next week. I kind of regret buying the components to build my own electric longboard now, because I feel I could have got a better board for cheaper :/

I meant to say next month, not next week. 

Building my board is surely a lot of fun and I'm learning a lot, but it's a bit disappointing to see that I'm spending more money for a single motor with approximately 18km range, when I could have got a dual motor, waterproof esk8 with apparently more range for cheaper :/

Busted up knee, tendon broke... In hospital for a few days until they can operate because on braking down a hill it cut out and he lost all control.... No brakes at all!

Thanks for linking that, although one isolated case cannot really tell much. From my understanding, the board cut off the brakes as soon as the battery reached 100% from regenerative breaking. Is that something that may happen to vescs as well? It may be good to keep it in mind when going down hill :slight_smile:

Depends on the BMS. Bypassing discharge would prevent that issue but can overcharge your batteries. Though that shouldn't be much of an issue given how little we regen.

Seriously Backfire? They weren't even concerned with his well being, they were like "You shared this on Facebook, why?"!

I placed an order for the hubs & a spare set of thane, they seem promising and wanted a gander at a hub driven build.

Meepo may be larger (90mm Vs 80mm) but backfire seem more powerful spec-wise, also backfire seem to be the target of some malicious ex-dealer network social activity.

As long as you stay under the max voltage, configured on your VESC you should be safe. Normally that voltage is the max the VESC can handle. So If you not driving on 12S you shouldn't have a problem.

But hey, if your BMS (if connected for discharge) or anything else fails and your VESC drops out, you ain't got brakes either.

Hi!

I've been reading this topic for a while and thought I should contribute.

Firstly, I have no previous skate/long boarding experience, only snowboarded for 8 years.
So, while getting annoyed with walking between office buildings at work I started looking into skate boards, long boards and ended up at electric boards.
Since this is somewhat of an experiment, while I'm also kinda impulsive, I decided to buy the Backfire 2.

So, I received the board last Tuesday (26/sept/2017) and took it for a test ride yesterday night.
As mentioned before. I have no previous experience, so also no reference to what a good long board feels like.
But I'm happy with my first experience.

When the package arrived I was happy to see that it was packaged well (in foam and 2 small plastic bags).
The remote, key/tool and cables/charger were packaged separately within the box.
The remote and board were charged.
On the first night I rode the board through my living room.

Yesterday I took it for a test ride through a nearby park.
I realize that long boarding is somewhat different from snowboarding and I have a lot to learn.

So my experience from riding it in the park:
The Economic mode is fast enough for me while learning to properly control the board.
I tried the Sport mode and it is fast!
I will test the board tonight again, with a friend who does have experience and I'll come back to add some specs.
So far it seems like the battery of both the remote and the board are holding up properly.
I charged it yesterday during the day and did not see/smell any issues (as in sparks, electric smell). I did read about this on other forums, but did not encounter any issues.I charged it just to try.
The brakes (in eco mode) work well too. I used first about 50% and then 100% and was not thrown off my board.

I have 1 issue though. When you power up the remote and the board, the remote is set in Sport mode by default.
I would think it would be smarted to be in Eco mode by default. Reason for this is that as a super novice user I feel that the Sport mode gives a proper kick.

A personal thing is the size of wheels. I live and work in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and here we have roads with asphalt, but also stones and tram rails.
I'm not yet sure how confident I would be riding the 80mm wheels over the trams rails.
If any one has tips on how/where to replace the wheels for a larger size, I'm all ears. I would be looking for 110mm.

Anyways, my conclusion:
I'm happy with the board! So far so good.
I realize I need to spend some hours/miles on the board.

As mentioned, I'll get back here to write more.

Just for the record, I have no affiliation with the makers, so I'm just here cause I enjoyed the read in this forum and want to contribute.
Oh! And I just wrote a short review on the FB page of Backfire. So that might ring a bell when reading it.

KR,

Be VERY careful when your battery is fully charged! Your brakes will most likely not work. Because there is regenaritive braking (which charges the battery back up), if you brake too much and the battery becomes fully charged again, your board will shut down, which will mean you'll lose ALL control! Not good of you're on a hill! There's a guy in one of the esk8 Facebook groups who had a pretty nasty accident resulting in surgery because of this issue!

For wheels, you'd need to replace the urethane on the hub motor. This is something that almost definitely isn't available. You could change out the front ones, as they're standard, but that would look kinda odd.

With regards to the automatic sport mode, if it did default to eco mode all the time, once you got confident with it and always wanted it to boot in sport, you'd soon be annoyed about that...
What would be better is if it remembered the last setting and booted to that setting...

Hi,

It's been a few days, but I further tested the board.
Hill climbing in Eco mode was not a great success for me. In Sports mode the board eat the 'hills' (read: bridges). I'm 73kg btw (google that in pounds, or just switch to metric like a normal person ;) ).

So far I reached a top speed of 30 km/h. Not sure if I maxed out the board yet, so I will get back to this. So I did not yet reach the advertised 40km/h.

I'm still running on the first charge, and I rode the board 4 evenings now, about 1,5 hour each time. So the battery seems to last pretty long. I will do a distance test soon.

About the downhill issue which @darkkevind warned for, I did not encounter an issue here. The breaks worked fine on the bridges (of which some are pretty steep). Also the breaks in general work fine, as long as you break gradually. Make sure not to slam the breaks.

So again, I'm positive.
Saw a guy on youtube (Ronnie Sarmiento ([video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8gcglqeeLc) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7oQ0uxbZng&t=445s))) riding the board and he seems happy too  (plus he is pretty funny to follow anyways).

Hope this helps. I'm really curious about other people their experience with the board!

KR,

Think they got the 100% battery brake issue fixed.
I’ve started twice with fully charged battery on a hill at the local high school to test with no issues.
It hasn’t been an issue but if you run battery all the way down the board will silently shut down and if you’re coasting you have no breaks, which I thought it was supposed to shutdown motors but breaks still work.  Guess not

I’m looking to buy a electric longboard for commuting. It would need to be waterproof, needs off-road tyres or be able to switch out wheels for off-roading wheels or tyres. I would like a top speed of 20-25mph and also a range above 10miles. Can anyone help? I’ve no experience in building my own, and because of this I’d prefer to buy a pre-built one, ive been looking at backfires Ranger which seems to be okay. Also considered the ownboard w1s with a Sanyo battery.

Ps. Had no idea how to create a thread or post or whatever, if you could help me with that too that would be great as I’m pretty sure this is the wrong place to post this.

yeah its more appropriate to post on another category but in any case, ranger would be a better choice for you IMO because Ownbaord w1s can't use off-road wheels like what DIY builds use. It's one of the very few Hub motors with off-road tires. Don't expect to carry it far though but water resistance and durability look to be good

Backfire is a stable company, they will deliver. Maybe some delays, but they will deliver. 

As far as mudguards, you are going to have to make your own. And the board weighs in the 30lb range.
