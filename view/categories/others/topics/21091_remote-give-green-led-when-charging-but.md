My Remote's charging LED hasn't gone red in several uses, always green when I try to charge. This morning I gear up, turn on all systems as usual, get connection, test for a split second, then nothing.... won't connect again, green left light comes on but only while holding "A" button. Charge Status LED still registers green when I try to charge. Right LED won't turn on to Green...

Just drag and drop from your desktop into the place where you type and wait for it to upload.

My guess is that somehow the battery inside is not being charged. Not sure why.
Does anyone have a trouble shooting checklist I can run through?
