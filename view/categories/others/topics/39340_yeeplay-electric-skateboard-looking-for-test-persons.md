20 amps is very low. Those cells will fry in no time. 2p packs need high current cells.

this is legitamitely just a meepo on a different deck! he even forgot to change the word "Meepo" in his description :joy:

Direct from his site:
"The case come with charging port build in. charging port is a cord that connects the battery and the adaptor.
Either you buy battery or battery with case, you will get a charging port. So you can charge it without assemble it into **Meepo Board**.
Recommended to get an extra adapter/charger for each battery, so that you can charge multiple batteries at the same time"

The esc is rated for 25A in extreme conditions (uphills)

Soo for usual cruising won't hurt too much
