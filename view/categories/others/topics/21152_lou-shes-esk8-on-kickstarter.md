A couple of days ago a new e-skate Kickstarter campaign launched. The design looks awesome but I am sure the battery is tiny. 
Anyways I have ordered one - for science! 

What do you guys think?

The marketing language with the constant "her" and "she" seems a little weird. 

They make a point to say that the motors are silent while riding, maybe this means that their ESC (let's be honest, probably a fork of the VESC) is running FOC?

Quoted in full for posterity before it is likely deleted:

> For everybody who's thinking of backing this project, please do your homework first.
> Remember Murphy's Law: If it's too good to be true, it cannot be true.
> This campaign has massive red flags all over it, and from what I can see, too many of what the @SoFlow team is doing is either shady at best and outright lies at worst.
> They've claimed that the LOU board is an original Swiss design, but the exact same model can be seen from a China company WINboard called the GT-M7.
> Look deeper and you will see that WINboard operates out of the same city as @SoFlow team's "procurement" office in Jiangsu Province, China.
> Proof SoFlow has "procurement" offices in Jiangsu Province, China: 
> https://media.wix.com/ugd/40c439_f6b5420f2321485e95fceb73363d27fd.pdf
> WINboard is from Jiangsu Province, China as well: 
> https://www.winboardskate.com/electric-skateboard-manufacture/
> When this was found out, WINboard suspiciously removed the GT-M7 from their list of products available within one day.
> If you google WINboard GT-M7 you will still see remnants of the cached images and websites showing evidence, including these:
> https://www.google.com.sg/search…
> https://plus.google.com/collection/wMM4lB
> The @SoFlow team is not the first Kickstarter electric skateboard company run by chinese companies masquerading as a caucasian brand.
> They claim to have a design patent and won the Red Dot Design award but there is absolutely no proof of this on the internet, nor have they produced evidence here to prove otherwise.
> I have also contacted WINboard and they have confirmed that both boards are EXACTLY the same, and they will sell the LOU board first before they start selling the GT-M7.
> http://i.imgur.com/3C14O2i.jpg
> It will also not be the first time an "aspiring" electric skateboard "startup" is offering their boards to you for an "unbelievable" low price with an impossible timeline. Check out the Stary and Leafboard Kickstarter campaigns as example, after TWO YEARS backers still have not received their rewards:
> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/staryboards/stary-worlds-best-electric-skateboard-get-yours-fo
> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leafboard/the-lightest-and-most-affordable-electric-skateboa
> This and almost all the positive comments on this page are from people who have joined Kickstarter in April 2017, and ONLY backed Lou?
> You don't have to believe me, but take it from people who have more experience in Electric Skateboards and Kickstarters discussing this campaign:
> https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/656d6j/lou_kickstarter_3_epenny_boards_single_single/
> https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/65634e/newcomer_in_the_industry_apparenty_electric/

> https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/65e49r/so_lou_board_just_gave_two_updates/
> My conclusion is as such:
> 1. The LOU Board is the EXACT same electric skateboard as the WINboard GT-M7. 
> 2. There is nothing original. The only thing that the @SoFlow team did is to "design" the Swiss Crosshatch Grip on the LOU. 
> 3. Everything else about the LOU board is a complete copy of the WINboard GT-M7, using a battery and hub motor system that has been used and re-used in all the other WINboard models. 
> 4. The @SoFlow team and WINboard are working together to sell this LOU board/GT-M7 together, and LOU board gets first dibs in this Kickstarter campaign.
> I would not have a problem with the @SoFlow team if they were just upfront about the entire matter and admit they are partnering with WINboard to sell this model of the WINboard GT-M7 under another name.
> However, this team is outright lying to EVERYBODY from the start of this campaign, and I believe this says alot about their integrity and how they will treat you backers after they have gotten your money.
> You as a backer might have a chance of getting what you paid for, but from the signs and history behind electric skateboard Kickstarter campaigns, be prepared to wait 2-3 years past their promised dates, and when it does reach you, be prepared to be disappointed by the performance versus the claims you were originally promised.

That is a lot of research you have done here! :D 

Thank you for the heads up! I should probably have seen the red flags myself but sadly I was not looking! 

It is a shame though. This could have been a great product!

Well I live in the same city and gave them a call. A few members of our esk8 squad will meet with them in 30 minutes to test the boards and ask questions.

I will try to ask all of the above mentioned issues and also provide a short review in video format if you like.

Real. bpltplbpltplbptlbpl hahahahahaha 


2 hours to charge a board with 7 miles of range maximum?  damn. It takes me 2.5 hours to charge my muscle boards and they'll do 25-30 miles at this board's top speed i'll bet. I'll bet this thing can only do 15-18 mph too. 

so far, what i'm seeing here is a whole lot of tradeoffs. Lightweight? yes. Power? no. Does it look great? yes. Does it go far? no. Is it lightweight and easy to carry? yes. Because you'll have to carry it a lot when it goes dead. Oh but wait, you can push it too. Reminds me of Mitch Headburg: "We're sorry, the escalator is out of service and is now stairs. We apologize for the conveninece."

If i had the cash i'd get one for science too. Then i'd hack it. 

It might actually be kind of perfect for a beginner though.

Can anyone derive any pack info from this blurry bigfoot pic of a battery? I can't tell if its a thin stack of lipos or a row of 18650s. It kind of looks like it could also be a 12S 1p lion or perhaps a 14S 1 P lifepo4, which are roughly equivalent in power/voltage. If I had to guess i'd assume they were using lifepo. If they're stating a range of 15miles on the 3.0 then they must be packing as much juice or close to the juice of the original raptor cell, which was 270 watt hours. I don't see how they're doing that though. 

This is all very suspect.

The manufacturer's data says 36V and 2Ah. So it's most likely a 10s Li-Ion Battery pack because as far as I know LiPos usually have a nominal voltage of 3.7 and LiFePOs of 3.2

@michichopf : Did you get to ride the board? If yes, version 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0? 
Aside from all the over exaggeration, i have to admit the board itself is still kinda​ interesting. fabTRAVs review made it seem like you get quite a nice board for a low price.

Alright.
Sorry but its easter and family lunch took longer than expected.

More information and videos will be following this post since we were offered to lend a LOU 3.0 within our group to test it extensively and to pass around so we have multiple feedbacks to give them. We were also invited to visit them at their headquarters to check things out. 

We were 4 riders meeting with LOU. 3 of us have extensive practice riding an esk8 and driven multiple systems from DIY, to boosted, evolve, Raptor etc. To give you our perspective.

We met in a café at easter monday, he was super quick and friendly in accepting our wish to talk with him and see/test the board. He came well prepared but so did we :). We first got to know who he is, what his company does and the experience they have. They already deal with big players (for switzerland) in direct sales for e-mobility. From hoverboards, to e-bikes, other electric longboards and now the LOU board. So supply chain and lead times won't be such an issue as we have seen with other kickstarters/boards. If they coulnd't deliver on time those big buyers (like Manor etc.) would jump ship immidiately. Also a lot of infrastracture is built/process of building. With warehouses all over. Also nice to know was that they are handling the aftersales of multiple products in a timely manner.

Now lets get to the boards. He brought a LOU 2.0 and a LOU 3.0 (single drive/dual drive full carbon). 

Deck: the deck felt solid, nice material, nice finish and very smooth. Here and there are minor upgrades that they will do since it is a prototyp. Such as a cap to ensure no water ingress from the charging port etc.

Trucks: Actual good trucks. somewhat unique in design but solid and very sturdy.

Wheels: Surprisingly good urethane. The first compliment I actualy gave about the boards was how smooth the board felt even though its a small hard deck with hubs. I have ridden other hub motors and I was pleasently surprised.

Insides: We were allowed to open up the boards and loock inside, we were asked not to show the pictures of the insides. Good to know/see was that it is a Lion pack with original panasonic cells. All the elctronics fit very nice.(the 3.0 has a bigger battery). 

Overall : I thinks it is actually a real contender for a short light board atm. It has a decent price point, is very light (around 4.2kg), sleeck design and very steatlhy. Perfectly suited for short comutes or joyrides, not so much for serious riding or long stretches (it is a nickel/penny board afterall). The fact that they plan to offer a 1 year warranty for both the motors and battery is nice, 2 years for the deck,trucks and other hardware.

To the reddit/kickstarter/forums comments. We of course asked him the uncomfortable questions you guys posted about. He explained to us that they are working on their boards for a long period of time (14 months). They designed the board and put a factory in China in charge of producing a board (like pretty much every big player in the industry). Their factory then realeased information to WINboard (which is a reseller) about the LOU with pictures they should not have, and LOU has filled legal steps against it. Also WINboard is about/has already taken down the board from their site. He showed us the certificate for the "reddot award" as well as the product design pattent. Anyone dealing with china/Shenzhen will know that patents don't mean anything to them. And a tight control and supervision is nescesarry to protect ones pattent. Hence the WINboard fail. All in all he was very open about it, even mentioned the comments and resevations from other himself. He was very adament on proving them wrong and he seems to have the proof to do so. 

Being willing to lend a board to a group of esk8ters who ride regularly in the group and commute daily to work/uni is very brave and shows a lot of faith for their product (even more since it is still a prototype). They want feedback and opinions, which is allways good. 

Since we will get a board in the next days to test further, let me know what questions you have. I will also do a range, hill climb, and speed test. Also what question you would like to have answered by LOU. Of course I will check with them before I release any pictures or videos since they lend us their prototype in good faith. No NDA was signed just our word and mutual trust.

So basically WINboard stole this from them and they're the original designers. And they are legit and can back up their claims, and don't have a terrible product.

Thanks for the detailed info!! 

I guess that it does not matter wether or not it is Chinese engineering or not - as long as it is reliable and good quality. 

I still feel that their is something off about the company... I dont know why. I think the company should make a public statement regarding this since many is confused about what to believe. 

I would love to see some solid proof too. Atm we only have the guy's word.

Possibly the esc and  board  design is Swiss engineered but no f'ing way are these hubs their design , the hubs have been available from Raldey and Bisek for over a year. Either way negative or positive Hopefully some of the backers post reviews and then we can order the parts directly from Winboard to make a 12s4p monster or other.

I really like this idea, it looks like a normal penny. I'm just wondering how that small battery will handle the power of a dual drive, from what I know Panasonic doesn't make high discharge cells. Do you know if anyone makes something like a123 26650 in 18650? Like lower mAh and little lower discharge rate?

I was also part of the group that met with Manuel (Lou's co-founder) and can certainly back all @michichopf is saying. My usual ride is the evolve carbon GT but I would certainly not compare Lou with such boards since it belongs to a different category - light small board vs huge heavy monster.
Both boards that we tried (prototypes) were very smooth and surprisingly comfortable for carbon/hub motor boards. They were super silent and stealth looking (that is a big advantage for all of us that live in cities that esk8 is not legal and police actually gives fines to riders). 
Both boards we tried (lou 2.0 and lou 3.0) were not final versions and surely needed fine tuning but all in all from the short test ride we had they were very enjoyable. Still the big questions of 1. How steep can they climb 2. How far can they go remain to be answered after the extended testing.
For sure Manuel was very open to answer questions, let us test the boards and seemed to want feedback from real condition testing

All the evidence you need is to look at the previous products/models Winboard offers. 

The previous model GT-M6 - Carbon fiber - Same wheels - same trucks. basically, your backing Winboard. https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/WINboard-GT-M6-replaceable-motor-PU_60618224267.html

Winboard has been in business for many years. So-Flow (Lou) magically appears and "apparently" has a factory in China that makes exactly the same Winboard manufacturing wise? Get the f-out. No need to be sherlock f-kin holmes to know something is fishy. 

Your backing Winboard, let that be clear. The board performance is another subject. Is it good? I hope so. But stop letting scammy companies get away with lying. "Swiss engineering"...

Its easy to tell So-Flow and Winboard are working together. No need to ask the Scammer(Lou) if they are, its like asking a snake oil salesman if his product is genuine. No need to ask as you have so much evidence. 

Fishy points:

- So-Flow website resells products from China. They took off Stary. 
- Kickstarter good comments. (look at the account age and comment history, made in April with 1 comment.) There is a grandad-ma saying perfect for her grankids....wow, suspicious as F!
Obviously the comments is to push the bad comments down.
-Red dot award is nothing, anyone can apply and you pay money to use the logo. 
-Look at Winboards previous models. 
-So-flow has no history of manufacturing boards. They do have history of reselling tho! All of a sudden they appear and make the same style - trucks - wheels as winboard?

The Lou on the Kickstarter page and the GT-M7 both have that ugly lid on the back. Did Manuel say anything about that? The prototype clearly doesn't have one and it looks great. (http://i.imgur.com/VGz3kqg.jpg)

Also it'd be nice to know if the battery compartments of the Lou 1.0/2.0 and Lou 3.0 are the same size. That would make it easy to replace the 2Ah battery with the bigger 3Ah battery.

You are completely right and wrong at the same time as I understood it.

First WINboard is only a reseller, they never touch design at all. They buy trading rights of various products. 


Secondly the Factory builds boards according to the wishes of their customers. So how I understood it after meeting them and trying to understand both sides i came to this conclusion. They modified the hubs on the drawing board (slightly though, I have seen both), they choose which trucks they want to go with. Then they actually designed the board (size, wheelbase, cutouts etc.) hence the design patent. Then they choose an also existing remote from that factory and slightly upgraded it and also put a display on it. The final upgrades will involve "seperate boxes" inside the board which hold the battery, the electronics etc. To ensure serious water resistance.

So did they invent hub motors?  No, existing one upgraded and changed to their liking.

Did they invent super crazy trucks? No, esxisting trucks (also existing trucks used by almost every board manufacturer)

I could go on, but the point is they toock components they like, upgraded and changed them in different ways, put them on their own deck design and found some original ideas along the way ( swappable deck cover, boxes compartement).

So if you expect of every "new" board to come out to have a new approach to trucks, motors and everything else you will mayby find 2-4 who actually inovate and bring the esk8 community to unknown territory (like carvon with their new boards, never done before) but trying to hold a board that cost you 249.- to the same standard to a board that costs 2900.- is also a little unfair. They never claimed best, fastest or anything. 

You could make the same rant about maytech,turningy,enertion, lhb etc to just copy motors and therefore they must be shit. Even though they are used and loved by the community.

And lastly. Soflow owns all right to the lou, but is part of E-xperience which are around for a long time and doing direct sales with rather big player here in switzerland.

The heatsink plate was removed in later stages. Since it was a problem for water resitance. The difference between 2.0 and 3.0 is not only battery size. The 3.0 has very different insides. The inside is different by both boards. Respecting the wishes and not posting more info or pictures.

As i said, you can ask the snake oils salesman. I believe Winboard and Soflow are working together. Every item so-flow is reselling, you can find the same products on Winboards alibaba. 

"They modified the hubs on the drawing board (slightly though, I have seen both". 

You don't think so-flow and winboard are upgrading together? I guarantee, purchase the most up-to-date hub motor from Winboard and compare it to Lou. 

"So if you expect of every "new" board to come out to have a new approach to trucks, motors and everything else you will maybe find 2-4 who actually innovate and bring the esk8 community to unknown territory (like carvon with their new boards, never done before)"

I don't expect every skateboard company to have unique parts but every little parts/detail the same? - the same specs? Winboard GT-M6 looks exactly like the build quality of Lou. Lou is just smaller. I mean everything. Winboard GT-M7 (the one they took down) is EXACTLY the same as Lou. You can only copy so far, but to have the same exact specs, i dont know how to put it black and white to you. ITS THE SAME!

"You could make the same rant about maytech,turningy,enertion, lhb etc to just copy motors and therefore they must be shit. Even though they are used and loved by the community." 

Let me clear this up for you. Did i say Lou is shit? I just don't like the deceitful lying. Dont think that is hard to understand. If they admit and said "we are working with another company in China to guarantee it is up to standards." I won't have a problem. + I dont see Maytech etc using crowdfund. You are basically backing a reseller that is meant for real small innovators, there is a difference. 

I backed Eon Unlimited which makes the motors and parts in China. I don't have a problem with that because they are open. the the pretentious "swiss engineering" bullshit.

What is the point? If Winboard and Lou are working together. I Say this again. Why are you relying on snake oils salesman word. If all evidence point to them being dishonest, aint that enough?  

if they are working together, they both have worked out the "patents" months ago. Lou will just keep denying, while Winboard is laughing to the bank. 

The red dot award, ANYONE can apply. If you win, you have to pay few hundred/grands to use the Red-dot logo. A lot of companies do it for marketing. Thats why there are so many "awards" you never heard of in your life. 

Its fine if you want the board, hopefully it is good. I dont question if the board is good or not. But do i think so-flow/lou are truthful? Hell to the f-no. how dare they use crowdfund like that and lie. "swiss engineering"....come on guys. You dont need to be sherlock holmes to know its BS.

So-Flow has no experience what so ever nor history designing/manufacturing electric skateboard. All of a sudden they have identical board + can promise the board to be ready in 1-2 months? Mellow/Eon took years to manufacture from scratch.

Not sure if i have made this clear. Do i expect the snake oil salesman to be honest? Not going to repeat again. 

Just think, they managed to make Winboard take off GT-M7 off their alibaba/website in few hours after suspicion aroused. Sooooo many foreign companies cant do that for YEARSSSS because Chinese do not give a shi*t about copyright. If Chinese dont give a shi*t about big multinational companies, why would Winboard give two sh*t about a small swiss company? 

Obviously, they are working together. Im sure Lou will showcase the patents and award, but does it mean anything?

Of course i am pissed, they using crowdfund to scam with "swiss engineering* and people are eating that sh*t up.

@caspa @michichopf @flatsp0t there are 6 flags in this thread already. Can we please resolve the debate, or at least let it fizzle? 

I think the point is made on both sides for now. Can we end the debate with this summary?:

1. Some manufacturers do not honor trademarks, patents, or copywrite when the legal implementation is in another country. 

2. This is more prevalent in some countries than others

3. Per OP, this thread is meant to be about a single esk8 offering, not about the broader cultural and legal challenges of globalized trade

No. That is just not true. (at least from my side).

The info you give is just ok and good to know.

It is just the way you "informed".
It was kind of the "Baseball bat" method you used.

I personally understood your point at the first post, and i have no reason to trust either of you.

Your posts just were a bit too agressive and condescending for my taste.

I actually thing you are right in some points, most stuff in Esk8 industry is just rebranded crap.

But i also can understand @michichopf.
If the board rides good, and there is a company in switzerland that has to back warranties by law, it is not completely bad.

I would still be false marketing, but i dont think that can be a reason for us to argue on that level we did.

@michichopf  To be honest.. the board / deck looks somewhat of good quality.

Also from what you told, it looks like the board itself (at least the one you tried and they had on their hands) is of high quality and should be ''used'' / resold further.

I still believe there needs to be more selection of eboards and this, taking into consideration, its ''class'' as being small, portable board, seems to be a good ''candidate'' to be added to the eboard list you can buy ready made..

---

Though.. I also dont like liers and dishonest people, so if there are some fishy things, people will of course be mad and suspicious about such actions..

So, personally, I would like to see the electronics part and some focus on the ''differences'' on what they have really made different for this product to be ''crowd-funded'' and sponsored by ''innocent people'' on kickstarter..

If it is just some chinese company who tries to reach western market through such means and these swiss guys you live close to have just 'accepted' to cooperate with them.. then this is not cool and they are just helping out these chinese guys to spread their product and nothing else, especially claiming it as their own.. so this is what creates the confusion..

--

Dont want to go more and more into this.. but I think they should start to understand that all this has created a massive fuss.. and if more people find about this.. they should ''back'' / ''claim'' what they said with real prototype drawings, pictures and other evidence that they really have worked on these boards on their own and havent just contacted manufacturer who had everything almost ready made.

Guys, lets lower the tones a bit. This whole thread has now turned to trash talk.

Our group just met with the guy out of curiosity to ride the boards and he was open enough to agree and answer any question we asked. We were mainly interested in the board itself and how it rides and will ride in the next versions and I believe this is what we shall mainly focus from now on too. Any other discussion on the origins of the board itself is probably speculation. Anyone can claim whatever they want on the internet and this stands for both sides.
From my POV if the board gets a little bit better tuned (remote more responsive), rides long enough, steep enough and has the 2 year warranty that Manuel said (1 year for motor and battery and one more for the rest)  it would be a very good addition to the current pre-built market.

I honestly don't care. If i see an advertisement for a scammy crowdfund, i will call out the bullsh*t. 

Let's get this straight. If it was just an ordinary company rebranding, i don't have a big problem. But when they advertise falsely while using crowdfund, yeah...im pissed. "Swiss engineering". 

You guys are actually helping them in a way by talking about their boards, it's still advertisement. 

Remember, i have nothing to gain from this. I have no reason to be biased. Im just scared more Chinese companies are going to come out the wood works from seeing scammy companies succeeding from crowdfund. there are a few already.

P.S - That warranty. If you donate to kickstarter, they don't have to technically honor it. So please, stop advertising the warranty.

(people saying "be silent", i was silent for the first scammy kickstarter. It raised a 1+ million. Now i see 5+ other scammy types come out. Do i carry on being silent?)

Our intention is to only provide information on how this board rides and it seems that many people but you are interested in this
I honestly do not know anything about how kickstarter warranty technically works, I just (maybe I shouldn't have) passed on the information I was given regarding the warranty of the product (whether it is for kickstarter backers, for future retail buyers or both I don't know, a simple question on their campaign would answer that)

I am surely not interested in arguing further with you and damaging further this thread

no such thing as bad publicity? It that why few members are now aware to the scam? 

If people are interested, let's rename the thread to "winboard/lou/dutch version"

What??? You going to ask the scammers how the warranty works?

P.S, if people didnt buy Lou, i bet you 100% Winboard will sell the GT-M7 again, without the reseller price tag on top.


On kickstarter, David includes this http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:TegIlUOPJqwJ:winboard007.en.alibaba.com/product/60597774160-804220164/WINboard_GT_M7_customized_single_hub_motor_carbon_fiber_electric_remote_control_electric_skateboard.html+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=sg&client=safari

Every detail and specs matches. Notice even the remote is the same? Notices the pictures "customers " are foreigners?

One fishy detail. On kickstarter they claimed the wheel was 83mm. On winboard alibaba its 80mm. Lou on kickstarter commented "now its 80mm". Lou didnt even know! they had to ask the Chinese for updates. On Lou facebook group, its their Chinese partner who has to answer the technical details.

Wait a second. There are two options.

* **The first one** is that SoFlow actually put together a board, using _some already existing parts_ (like hubs, seen in many other chinese eboards, and the remote, already seen in the good old bisek, that was actually not good and had remote connection problems, but that's another story). He then contacted chinese manufacturer that _copied and resold_ their his board, with the winboard brand. That's common stuff, already seen with Jacob's hubs, for example.

* **Second option**, _he didn't develop anything_ and just made agreements with winboard to resell their product as a kickstarter campaign, to make more money and, in a way, scam some people with the "swiss engineered" promises. Winboard deleted their product page to hide the fact that the board was just a normal chinese one

We can't know which one is the truth, and all your "evidence" doesn't mean anything. I would actually like the owner to come here and explain how this board was born. This could actually be a good entry level product, the ultimate _very last mile_ vehicle, but the "swiss engineered" doesn't seem to go well with this, considering that, for now, their office is in China, their motors and remote are chinese and that's where the production actually happens. If this was sold as a normal board there would be no problem, but if it's just a matter of rebranding and lying then the don't deserve to make any money out of this. 

Now, just shut up and wait for evidence please.

So...winboard copied the design, went back in time with a time machine. Used the copied hubs, remote, carbon fibre, design, shape, trucks, same button for on/off, every single detail on their very first model GT-M1 to GT-M8 that has been made 2-3 years ago. 


Some how, Winboard updated their hubs to 80mm before Lou...i didnt know this thread turned into a comedy.

@caspa okay, I agree you are drawing some good points here.. but people here are without your extensive knowledge of how ''slippery'' chinese actually are.

IF you could post some of their previous boards and the very resemblance to the ''new model'', which assumingly ''Lou'' wants to sell.. then that would portray a completely picture here, I think..

Now it just looks like there is some sort of co-operation with the chinese manufacturers/resellers but it is not entirely clear up to this point are ''Lou'' team really such ''weasels'' who put different beautiful names like innovation, design etc in front and want to even get some crowdfunding money this way or is it the story as some people also draw here, that the chinese ''got the designs first'' and just made a production run of their boards, maybe modified or left out a few things and now they have a board which was essentially designed by these swissguys but was actually manufactured beforehand in china, before the swiss guys managed to scrape enough money to cover the manufacturing costs..

 This is the missing stone left, I think, as without insider info it is hard to tell what is really going on here.. though the longer they go around the problem and does not adress it, the more people will probably get sceptical about it (the ones who are following this ''authenticity'' of design etc..)

--

Now it is not 100% confirmed yet are they just scammy resellers in West, who want to ''rebrand'' chinese product by 100% by claiming it is swiss made / swiss engineered and what not..

We do have some fishy, suspicious clues about all this thing, indeed.. but I think it is not super wise to jump ahead.. no offense, Im sure we will get to the core or closer to an answer, @caspa

Did you not read my post? HE TOOK PARTS FROM CHINA, that's obvious. Hubs, remote and trucks are obviously the same, but can you tell me what else did they take before the last model?
[This](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/light-weight-36v-single-motor-7_60593930082.html) is the first, it doesn't look like a penny with integrated electronics.
Neither does [this](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/WINboard-GT-M2-2-4Ghz-smooth_60650565656.html?spm=a2700.7724838.0.0.OzfynE) one 
or [this](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/WINboard-GT-M3-water-proof-smooth_60615489139.html?spm=a2700.7724838.0.0.I6hzZF) one

(these aren't even hub motor boards)
While [this](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/WINboard-GT-M6-World-s-First_60630045615.html?spm=a2700.7724838.0.0.NaMFaM) one  gets the carbon fiber but is just a[ bisek deck](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/USA-carbon-fiber-electric-longboard-with_60474702435.html). This just means that many chinese producers use the same parts. 

Now, the only one that is exactly like that is the last model, so your "time travel" theory argument is just nonsense, because they could have sent the drawings and be copied, production takes time.

But the fact that many parts are just chinese was already clear from the beginning. just to remind you:
[quote="michichopf, post:45, topic:21152"]
Secondly the Factory builds boards according to the wishes of their customers. So how I understood it after meeting them and trying to understand both sides i came to this conclusion. They modified the hubs on the drawing board (slightly though, I have seen both), they choose which trucks they want to go with. Then they actually designed the board (size, wheelbase, cutouts etc.) hence the design patent. Then they choose an also existing remote from that factory and slightly upgraded it and also put a display on it. The final upgrades will involve "seperate boxes" inside the board which hold the battery, the electronics etc. To ensure serious water resistance.

So did they invent hub motors?  No, existing one upgraded and changed to their liking.

Did they invent super crazy trucks? No, esxisting trucks (also existing trucks used by almost every board manufacturer)

I could go on, but the point is they toock components they like, upgraded and changed them in different ways, put them on their own deck design and found some original ideas along the way ( swappable deck cover, boxes compartement).

@SirDiff  Im agreeing to what you are saying here and in previous message.. It does look like chinese could have taken the exact design etc.. and swiss guys did make it on their own (the design, part specification etc)

By looking at previous models some parts might be similar.. like trucks or wheels(hubs), but they dont look 100% the same, at leas to me..

So from this it is hard to claim anything and Im also sort of supporting the idea that Swiss guys just redesigned most / some of the parts, then sent the designs and chinese just rubbed their hands and started production straight away..

--

Though im not entirely sure in what position does this put the Swiss guys.. who basically has lost their product now to the chinese..

**One last thing im unsure of is this:**

## Who made the Winboard people remove the listing/board from their page? 

## Was it their own move or the swiss guy made it work?

Look at this, was posted some days ago but the repetitiveness of other posts covered it.

[quote="michichopf, post:26, topic:21152"]
He explained to us that they are working on their boards for a long period of time (14 months). They designed the board and put a factory in China in charge of producing a board (like pretty much every big player in the industry). Their factory then realeased information to WINboard (which is a reseller) about the LOU with pictures they should not have, and LOU has filled legal steps against it. Also WINboard is about/has already taken down the board from their site.
[/quote]

(also, you know that iPhone clones in China come out before actual iPhones, right? People working in their factories just take the projects and copy them. The fact that they don't have to do any quality control to sell in their market makes production way faster)

Okay.. that does explain a few things, so it might be that some sort of legal action did put the chinese to take out the listing/board out of their page.

Also if what @michichopf said is true.. then it looks like Winboard was not directly related to Lou, but another factory/company made the deal, thus Winboard is just a 3rd party who got the design/files/3d models etc (thus less responsibility / fault on their side, kind of).

--

If this is true, then chinese are ''slippery''.. just dont know the right english word for them now :D

--

Yes, I've watched the documentary..chinese think if something is a good product, then by taking the design and making it again is not ''copying'' as we see it.. they just sort of have different mentality but it gets nasty when you buy a product which looks like a brand one, when actually it is not and is a knock-off but you have paid a similar price.. then this is cheating, in this case, I think.

Ah what a shame. The chinese dude already replied.

"Sure happy to receive guests. This is the address 无锡市滨湖路4号智慧产业园B区 Wuxi Binhu district 4 - Zhihui Industrial Park - B district - I also can pick the visitor up from the Wuxi train station. Please inform me in advance when you come - this is my mail z.giang@e-xperience.ch - cheers"

@SirDiff Of course different models,different body. but you dont see the same hub motor? same remote? same trucks? The oldest one that resembles the most to Lou is GT-M6. I would say GT-m7 but you guys will say its a clone... Biesek, look at their store on alibaba, they specialise in bicycle. its quite common for chinese companies to resell other manufactures products for commision. 

You can get fake apple/samsung etc. But is it the same 100%? Of course they cant copy 100% what is no released yet. So how can they copy 100% from lou? Also as you say, in China you can get fakes, so how comes apple/samsung cant stop clones , but a small swiss can in few hours ? Aint it obvious? winboard makes 10-50 million turnover annually, i dont think they would let a small swiss company bully them. Trust me, Chinese goverment/patent office will side on Chinese companies over foreign unless there is political reasons. 

You also should know so-flow is a reseller company. Look at so-flow instagram. They resell a lot of what Winboard offers rebranded (obvious they work together). 

@greenstuffs21   I will message him. But i will go when i have my business trip later this year as i wont risk him trying to be slippery and come out with excuses. i dont want to waste a trip looking at a desk with excuses. 

Look guys, im not bothered because its easy to tell you guys made up your mind. You saw something you like, and you guys want it to be true. fair enough. Im 100% telling you right now, your backing resellers. have fun.

I backed them for Lue 1.0. One of the first backers actually. I was scouting a penny/nickel electric boards for a while and was kind of thinking of buying SoFlow FlowDeck at first. That's when I discovered that their (or "their"?) new Lue board is going to be launched so I saved the KickStarter date in case the price is right. The early bird prices were OK so I went for it. Don't mind if they are just re-sellers but it is weird why not admit it and just dig a deeper hole. I don't think I could get a much better price even buying the (similar) board directly from china (considering the import charges). I also don't think this campaign is a straight scam, that our money will be lost. But things do seem fishy at times yet I am an optimist so far. Anyhow, there is still plenty of time to back out if needed.

I understand the specs are probably greatly overrated but still, the 4 guys who went for a test ride seem to have a good time. Portability is cool. It will be a good board for short commutes to work and lunch breaks :pizza: Once they deliver it, that is. But for me, even if it board fails to meet my expectations or they take a long time to deliver, I have a 4-year-old who will be impressed by it in a year or two. I'll give it a Spider-man themed interchangeable top deck and he will LOVE IT :smiley:

I will give you some info. 

Winboard chinese website offers the GT-M7 for £200(not including shipping + minimum order 2 units) for the carbon fibre version compared to £390(not incl shipping) advertised on kickstarter (2.0 model). So no, your not getting an equivalent deal. 

Shipping would be the same since both are shipped from China and no you wont be charged custom duty if you order from Winboard. Since chinese usually declare the value very cheap or declare it as a gift. That is how Lou (im guessing) will do it also. 

So...to summarise. your not getting a deal. After kickstarter they will raise prices so everyone after you will get a shitter deal. From the success of this campaign, more Lou equivalent will appear on kickstarter.I really dont see a positive...

The fact that not a single Lou team member noticed this error worries me a little bit."

Well, I didn't actually say that the campaign was about getting a better deal. Heck, I didn't say that I was getting a "deal". Or even "equivalent deal" :slight_smile:

Still, being one of the first backers, I shall eventually be receiving two additional replacement decks and a set of additional wheels which increases the value of the KS for me (but not for everybody).

Also, Alibaba usually has minimum order quantities. You can't usually just buy one piece, like you said. I don't need two boards :slight_smile: Not to mention bad experiences regarding support of Chinese products as soon as you mark the item received and leave feedback. There is no support whatsoever, replacement parts are not available, shops are closed. We shall see how the situation will be with SoFlow. I don't have great expectations, suppose I could only be surprised at the end. So, weighting pros and cons, I chose to back them and there is still a chance to pull my pledge. Everybody else should do their own math and decide. You seem to have a need to force your opinion to people which I don't like.

The GT-M7 was actually available, you didnt have to wait. Its just Lou needs to due to kickstarter policy. 

With your purchase, you could have bought 2 boards, lmao. For you and your daughter. Winboard do offer 1 year warranty. If one breaks, u got another to ride straight away haha, so i guess 2 year warranty? Winboard makes 10-50million a year. They aint some little scammy chinese company that would leave you hanging if any problems occur. Where do you think Lou is going to send your your unit for repair? The repair services they talk about are sponsored by Winboard obviously. 

anyways, as i said. People made their minds up even if it is a worse deal.

You guys are weird. About 10 years ago I bought a Compal laptop from a Dutch company who just shipped containers of laptops to the EU. 10 months after I started using my Compal laptop the famous brand DELL launched a new laptop. An identical laptop, build by Compal, (re)branded by Dell. Huge price markup because you got a 2year EU DELL warranty on it. Today my Compal laptop still boots up fine (not that I use it anymore though, its obviously old).

My point is who cares about rebrands? Most of the stuff we buy gets produced in China anyway. 

If SoFlow's part is to bring some kind of support to EU (I'm aware what kickstarter & warranty means, I backed a dozen of projects the past years, half of them being shit) while reselling Wintechwhateverchinaproducedstuff than I'm completely fine with that Swiss guy making some money on it.

The Lou 1.0 seems like a noob friendly basic small waterproof board for a 'normal' price, I see nothing wrong with that. I even intend to back one.

The pro's should just stop bitching and buy mellow 4x4's so they can stare down on the Lou idiots who backed a kickstarter that uses stuff made in China. Welcome to world economy.

There is a difference from your example;

1)They don't just simply produce the Lou in China, a Chinese company designed it. I doubt your laptop was designed from China. 

2) Its not about just "rebranding", Its the deceitfulness of the whole "swiss" engineering. If they were upfront and honest instead of trying to slyly play off the Winboard situation, it would have been better.

Alright finished the testing / recording: speed, hill climb, acceleration, braking, range, throttel controle, weight, weels, trucks and bushing are done. Also my take on the board and recomendations for whom it would work out.Did I miss something? And all of the footage is POV or mounted camera with drive by's. Would you like some 3rd person footage of an e-board following me or do you think its unescesarry. If not I could edit it (virtually no skills though) tomorrow and upload it, or get follow cam footage tomorrow and upload it monday.

Following Michichopf’s review, I borrowed the Lou 3.0 beta board for some test riding as well. As I have mentioned in previous posts my normal ride and measure of comparison is the Evolve carbon GT. Unfortunately the weather didn’t help and I only got to briefly test it before handing it back to the owner. Below is my personal opinion of the Lou 3.0 beta board:

I did a ~5.5km ride with average inclines and the board performed nicely. Unfortunately I do not know how much more range the board had in it after that ride. It didn’t have any issues going up and accelerating on average inclines (I did a very poor calculation online, based on the vertical climb and the distance travelled and the max steepness grade I have tested was approximately 7%). The max speed was fine for me as I am not a very experienced rider and I don’t feel super comfortable with anything above 30-35 on a penny board. For sure acceleration is slower than the GT which launches uphill but it wouldn’t be fair to compare these two as they belong to different categories and the GT costs almost three times as much as Lou does. Two things I have noticed on this beta board are 1. The board kept on beeping constantly (I don’t know what the reason was, but it didn’t seem to affect the riding) 2. On steep downhills the brakes were not strong enough to get me to a stop. These two issues can be related to the fact that the board was a beta version.

Overall my test was very short and not thorough but in my POV Lou was very comfortable for a penny board with hub motors, suitable for city commutes, fast enough for a penny board (for an average rider) and powerful enough to climb average hills (didn’t test it on extremely steep inclines). On the downside the lack of power in braking is something that needs to be addressed in the future versions.

For the price Lou is charging for the dual hub version. This seems to be a better deal.  10s3p battery, same esc, remote, hub motors.   The price Lou is charging for the dual motors seems really expensive to what you can get from winboard.   The single Lou on the other hand is a decent deal.   Winboard already has an app out for these to change acceleration and braking curve

Wich Version of the Lou is it equivalent to (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) and where did you get it?
I wrote a mail to winboard just out of curiosity but they told me the gt-m7 is not for sale anymore.
The only board that seems to be worth buying is the 3.0, but for that price I'd rather get something else... @longhairedboy

My rule for Kickstarter over 50 USD (including shipping) - wait until release and first try reports... Paying a bit more for release-price would be more secure as paying everything to a company not able to release...

For the copy incidents: wouldn't be that much of a problem if a finished product is available and reaches what promised (so: 1. public purchase available, no pre-order, 2. reviews of ranges from multiple sources - not in video format - FabTrav and so on always say it's a pre-release version - so this doesn't count).
I asked so-flow whether it's possible to visit them in Swizerland. - No reply yet.So - I wait until they're publicly available. The so-flow website doesn't have an imprint, but their whois points to a swiss address... Even the new louboard.com doesn't have a real imprint. 

FabTrav's most said sentences about Lou is "I talked to (whoeverproducedlou). They'll deliver, I promise". That said it's a sign that some are in doubt...

I ordered the Lou 1.0  the day before yesterday for like 550 Dollars. Until now i didnt recieved any Messages from "So Flow" Company. Now i found this site and read all ur Differents Points what made me confused. 
Lets say the Board is a Copy of the Winboard. The Winboard Gtm 7 is not availible to buy right ? Either is there a comparable Board to buy at all, is there ? 
U guys think its not worth the Money i payed ? What are ur suggestions to me if its not ?

That was an example, I didn't even have to search it, alibaba put it in my recommended. It just proves Lou doesn't have an exclusive on this, and it's already proved that all its parts are chinese. Range is half of the stated one, and it sags a lot when battery is low. For the starting price it wasn't even bad, but I made myself a 6374 190kv motor and samsung 25R 10s3p battery build for 550 euros, and that's way better. If they can sell it for 205 dollars, it means it's worth less than 200$ of parts, which is basically a third of the price you paid for it. 
I'm just mad for that "swiss engineered bullshit", that's all. In a couple of months they're gonna start selling on aliexpress again

Ah okay now i got it. I tryied to find one on Alibaba myself, without succes tho. 
The Reason why i dont build my own is that i love the design of the Lou Board. Here in Germany its not legal to ride a E-Board, so with the Lou i feel relativley safe that nobody will regonize it as an E-Board. 
If there realy is no comparable Board right now, they can legitly put the Price as high as they want i guess.
Im trying to get my Money back, be calm and wait for the cheap ones on alibaba again :)
Ah just saw " jet " ´s Post. Thank u mate, im about to message them !

Try to seem like a legit buyer, ask about prices for 100, 200 etc, shipping, lead time, blablabla. If they think you just want 1 board they wont be interested in dealing with you. These guys are pumping out thousands of these things, selling you 1 isn't going to make any difference to their life and the sales person wants their commission.
