Cool, note how the wheels can move independently at the end

Cant figure out how he did this, and if it is truly a dual drive from one motor. Seems the only way to do this would be to have some sort of clutch pack somewhere, or a limited slip mechanism, but unless he did something inside the motor you can't see anything going on. Would like to see him hold one wheel and put power to the other and visa versa.
If he did really figure a true way to drive two wheels with one motor and have it rideable, this guy is awesome!

```
the motor pulleys have one way bearings.

I would think it would make a lot of click noises.

How would that help to drive the wheels independently?

```
it would act like limited slip differential for turning etc

```
But the wheels were able to be rotated in the same direction as when driven by the motor. So I still don't understand. With the bearings, turning the wheel would also turn the motor can - right? We don't see that in the video so there must be some sort of "loose" connection - can't be just bearings and a single axis

```
kind of like a ratchet 

allows a wheel to reverse but seems noisy and complicated. 

Will be interesting to see how it performs.
