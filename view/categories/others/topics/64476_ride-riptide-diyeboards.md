Just learned that riptide buys all of their stuff from www.diyeboard.com
I paid over $700 for a smaller battery and esc capacity when I could have just bought the e-board kit with a larger capacity and voltage battery for $440. Literally all you would need to do is upgrade the wheels and get a similar board. 

Bingo you have riptide....

http://www.diyeboard.com/10s5p-360wh-battery-esc-dual-motor-belt-drive-power-truck-kit-p-590.html

I haven't even received the board yet and i'm debating on returning it. 
Maybe ill use their existing motors, trucks, drive chain, deck and enclosure then change out for a better VESC and put lipos on it.

Anyone wanna place bets for how long till this gets locked?

Edit: And i mean, you didn't get rip-off per say, you just didn't do your research , finding either this forum or the subreddit would've eventually allotted you to find DIYEboard.com and the kits that are available. 

look at the bright side, at least you get an American representative warranty and the deck!

Welcome to the forum.

I would say 90% of the people here already knows that because some of us purchase parts from them.

You are not an idiot. You trusted something that was marketed well to you and at some point in our lives we all buy something that sucks and or  make excuses that even if it does suck it's worth it because of , whatever reason you want to believe. :slight_smile:

Yeah, it's an odd, but understandable rule. It's a business and moderators suggest you talk to them privately.

Just because you have an issue with them making a profit by using cheap Chinese factory and parts doesn't mean it's an actual issue other would have so less bashing, more informing would be fair.

Its a decent product imo. You get very good wheels and a dual belt drive board for a decent price!

I recently built a board with DIYEBoard dual motor drive, my own enclosure and dual  vesc. After some small adjustments, i'm actually quite happy. $158 for a pair of pre-built drives is very good! A similar price on BKB or Torqueboards would cost close to $480. Not as smooth, quiet as a self built setup but can't complain for the price.

Not trying to defend his board at all but the front TKP and back RKP setup isn't bad. I believe some people on this forum run a front TKP with a back RKP. Its actually pretty nice for lower speeds as you can carve a lot better compared to dual RKP.

Not saying that it's a bad idea to have a tkp up front and an rkp in the back but I find it weird that it's like that on the hub motor version and the belt drive version (at least from the pictures on his site) has a rkp truck front and back

I don't think so because the pictures on his site for the hub motor version have the tkp truck on it. And if the version in the pictures wasn't the final version why would he bother doing a full on photo shoot for that prototype knowing he would have to do another one for the final product in the end?

well i jus found that may be Fab will have a small problem, because even on DIYeboards they say that the dual belt motor should be use with a 6s or 10s batt and if im not wrong the 7s wont be that good for those dual belt motors, or does he change the internal bat of the enclosure for a diferent one?

because if thats the case i would like to know the specs of that batt, becuase i see that having a 10s bat against 2 or 3 7s that i can swap on the go, could be better, but i dont want to buy the 7s kit and then feel like i was better with the 10s.

well im stock with my build, i bought the trucks and wheels, caliber II with abec 11 (the same as riptide  R1Elite), the battery will be a 10s5p with a esc (for the moment), but my problem it's with the motors, dont know if i should buy the 5055 270kv 1400W or the 6354 180kv 2000W.

## \#60 Posted by: Sn4pz Posted at: 2018-12-27T23:14:58.889Z Reads: 75

second choice for sure, the dual 180kv should pack enough punch and topspeed with 10s, especially in a dual config

just stay away from diyeboards though. theyre scammers and bad people :man_shrugging:

so there would be no prob with that config?, and the problem i have its that the only place where i can buy a motor, battery, esc, control etc its there, or another site that you recommend, because i live in mexico, so the shiping some times kills me, and i need that the package its send via ups, dhl or fedex, because usps will deliver it to mexican post service and they will or take like a month to deliver, or distroy it T.T

## \#62 Posted by: Sn4pz Posted at: 2018-12-27T23:26:22.576Z Reads: 70

that build should work well, but I recommend the 180kv because if you ever upgrade to a vesc, 10s and 270kv would certainly pop the vesc, but not the Chinese ESCs

also 10s and 270kv is stupid fast, but very very mediocre torque

XD!!!!!! i was thinking on finding a 230Kv motor, that should be 50/50 if im nor wrong, in amazon i found the motor, and may be i'll order it there, but now ill look if i buy the battery and esc from diyeboards or someone else, i know a lot of people have a really bad reputation from there, but a lot have a good one, but sometimes having two options its the best.
```

## \#64 Posted by: Sn4pz Posted at: 2018-12-27T23:31:06.369Z Reads: 68

230 would be pretty fast, with decent torque as you have a dual motor setup

just remember if you ever go for a VESC, to use a motor that is 190kv or less with an 10s setup, to avoid the 60,000 erpm limit

I know that I bash diyeboard quite a bit, but if theyre the only people who ship to your location then go for it
