Those are good specs for the price man. If I was buying my first board or just secondary board I'd look into this if I hadn't already sworn off production boards lol

If there are needs, actually I dont see why winboard will not consider. But probably if winboard starts selling parts, these will be for the purpose of upgrading their boards from former winboard products.

Are you gonna do another crazy group buy?
