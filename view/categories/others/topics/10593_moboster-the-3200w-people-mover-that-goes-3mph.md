Kind of cool looking but maybe they should put handicapped or
Elderly people
On it at 3mph.  Like to know how they get it to turn with power

Where do they get the funding for this kind of stuff? Even if it were a practical product, which it isnt, people still wouldnt buy it because it makes them look stupid.

There are great applications for something like this. I'd most likely use it as an rc cart to save my back. You could mount it to a baby carrier. If it had a "follow me" feature, it could be used for even more applications. I like it. I probably wouldn't ride it that often but I like it.
