Hey all, 

I'm looking to get into electric skateboarding. I've recently been looking at the Torque boards over at , namely the Freeflow, and the Rocket dual. However, I haven't seen any reviews or anything regarding these boards, so I'm hoping to see what the community thinks before diving in on them.

Freeflow link:
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torque-rocket-freeflow/

Rocket Dual link:
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torque-rocket-dual/

If anyone has any thoughts here to help me out, I'd really appreciate it. 

Thanks guys

Torqueboards has been a pretty established vendor for a while and many people are using his products without many complaints. I'm using his mechanical kits along with his motors and VESCs and haven't run into any issues and everything has been quite durable. If it matches the specs listed, and from what I can tell it seems too, than those boards are definitely great value for money if you're looking for a compact cruiser that can tackle hills.

So are hub motors better or are the belt drive ones better?

Or are both of their motors good?

Those hubs look pretty small TBH so I'm pertty sure that the belt drive would deliver higher preformance.

Belt drive is more durable/reliable by far. Hub motors are nice and work great. The ones we have for sale now are great but if your trying to climb a 25-30% incline 10-20 times over.. I'd want to be on a dual belt drive setup vs a hub motor anyday. Flat ground, you'll be fine though.

We're just waiting on the decks which should be available any week now :)

Ok that sounds great, thank you for chiming in on that!

I guess another question for you here. How easy is it to replace the battery on your boards? I would like to purchase a second to keep in a backpack while riding and swap when it runs out.

## \#8 Posted by: torqueboards Posted at: 2017-01-13T04:50:37.406Z Reads: 356

```
@itsgreekpete - Yeah, would take about 20-30 seconds to remove the bolts. I'd use 4x of the 6x M4 screws and perhaps use "shorter" screws that way less time to "unscrew" then you'd just need to pull off the XT90 plug and put in the other battery. The battery will be sit in with a strip of adhesive velcro.

@Hummie - They can, you just need to go up with speed but I wouldn't do it too many times in a row. Better to use a belt drive setup for steep hills IMO.

What do you mean in a row? Like back to back in one use?

Also when is the expected ship date on the rocket duals?
```

## \#13 Posted by: torqueboards Posted at: 2017-01-16T02:03:11.162Z Reads: 318

```
@shnaru - Yeah, back to back. You just want to minimize heat and going back to back up a steep hill especially without any speed will increase heat for hub motors. The more speed you have the better. You can't start and go up a hill like you can with a belt drive setup because of the lack of gearing but with speed you can go up some pretty steep hills. We just had a customer who's topping 39mph with a 12S with Dual 130KV Hub Motors lol. I wouldn't recommend it for others but goes to show you how much power DIY boards put out. Personally, I don't go nowhere near that fast.

Dual motor belt drive setup you can go up hills back to back with no issues. Hub motors for flat grounds, higher top speed. Belt drive for torque, power and durability.

They should start shipping out Early February.

Hi, I was looking to buy your carbon deck. I was curious about the rectangular hole on the top of deck, is it a clear fiberglass cover? or just a hole? Also is the deck in any way waterproof?

@fababuba As of now, it will be open, the battery components (On/Off Switch, Battery % Indicator, 2x USB, Charging Port) will be shown through the window. We're planning on adding a waterproof cover which will cover it. The bottom is waterproof.

I'm really liking the Torque Rocket Free Flow. I'm I the only one that thinks the motor on the Torque Rocket Dual is way too close to the ground? It looks like it would really hit and scrape just about everything. Wondering if the motor could be moved, say to the rear, kind of like Evolve boards.

yeah, this is a sweet deck. The motors looks OK to me; provide enough clearance to the ground. To be honest on such deck, I will not put motor to the rear.

@Eboostin - Yeah, I believe we have a few without the cut out of you aren't using our batteries these would work for you.

@Zoddy @itsgreekpete - The clearance is typical clearance of any DIY setup. The truck base is actually parallel to the bottom of the carbon fiber deck.

**P.S. - We have about 4 boards left for this batch. Any orders after will be on the next batch. If anyone is interested and wanted it soon. I'd suggest ordering soon. Delivery time is about 2-3 weeks for any new orders. Preferably 2 weeks (USA orders).**

@torqueboards what is the thickness of the lid? And does if flex a little with a person weight? My concern is it transfering the weight to the batteries 

And what's only the deck weight? If it's ligher than my current deck + enclosure it will be hard to resist

@pedrodemio Lid is 3mm thick. Doesn't flex with me on the lid I'm about 180lbs. It's got a bit of flange around it for support too. Deck by itself weighs 4lbs. What's yours weigh?

Nice, only my deck weight 4lbs , and I weight the same as you

The only thing that worries me is water, where I live it's inevitable to get wet or have to ride thru some poodles (or puddles) from time to time, maybe some rubber seal will do the trick, or duct tape, that's what I'm using on my current build

I've had my eye out for a deck that would accommodate the standard drop G-bombs hangers I ordered at the beginning of my build but later scrapped the idea because of overall length.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/0/a0101d5602f3860b65ee3dbf5fbfbe0eddbff890.jpg" width="690" height="385">

This is G-Bomb's "Freewill" deck. It'fairly short which would almost certainly limit batter capacity but I like the proportions. Would like to see a pic of these G-Bomb's on your deck.

The height is a bit much. I personally don't mind the stiffness. But that height is a bit much. Going to take a set of risers off to see if that makes any difference. Seems I would be pushing it if I took off two. Maybe someone at torqueboards could chime in ? Would that be ok to do?

@itsgreekpete - You can take a set of risers off. It's not that tall from a regular deck. It's about 1/2" difference. The difference is barely noticeable. Did you order? Can't tell from your SN.

We're waiting on the longer trucks. Once you have the longer trucks you can remove about 10-25mm from the risers and drop the setup.

I got the GBomb's recently.. Haven't put it on yet to try it.

I was part of the first batch, just got it in today. Was able to ride it a little before the rain. Super solid board all around. Although those longer trucks with a lower setup are a bit more up my alley. Any idea when those are coming in? Would it be possible to rear mount the motors as well?

Yeah, haven't done it yet but occasionally we get a few people who want to rear mount the setup. I'll look into it and let you know. If you rear mount it with the longer trucks.. You could definitely drop it a lot more. The low rider boards are pretty sweet.

I should be getting the longer truck sample soon if it's perfect we'll have them soon. I assume your Peter then :)

The height makes the board a bit awkward to push. It also makes the ride feel a tad unstable. I think the board needs wider hangers, the cutouts don't align with the wheels so without the risers wheel bite is a real issue.

I'll be interested as well in the longer hangers as I'm increasing finding the height of the deck an issue. If mounting the motors on the rear helps to drop the deck, I'll want to do that as well.

I haven't done a proper range test yet due to colder weather, limits battery perfirmance, but the advertised range falls into that ballpark. I chose the 90 mm wheels specifically for eating up rough pavement and they seem to do well. Physically, I get fatigued after a 5-6 mile ride in my lower legs and I've heard others say the same thing with other esk8 riders. The carbon fiber fatigues me faster than my bamboo deck. This may have to do with the wide stance needed to avoid the top panel or the lack of flex in the board or me just getting accustomed to a new board.

The range is definitely there, as is the performance on rough roads. The asphalt on my streets is extremely rough/bumpy and quite a few cracks and holes. I had no issue with grip at high speed on these streets. As far as range is concerned attwo miles I had 85% charge while riding between 15-20 mph. This is with the 12s battery. I haven't done a proper range test, but that's where I was at 2 miles.

Since I'm new to eskate I have a quick question. How much resistance should there be in motors? It seems the ole motor has quite a bit while the other doesn't really. Also, when keeping the board in its back and giving full throttle and letting the motors just run out on their own, the one motor stops a full second before the other (probably due to the resistance). Not sure if that's a big deal or not. By the way I'm defining resistance as a type of "clicking" feeling (no sound) that makes the motors resist when spinning the wheels.

Yea that review sounds exactly how I felt. The high end torque wouldn't stop. I couldn't take it any faster than 20, but I have a bit more throttle to see how much pull was left and it was instant pull and power. Blew my mind. 38 is insane.

You are partially right however some of that fatigue is from having to absorb road vibration. A stiff board will also require more micro adjustments where a flexible board helps smooth out the need which is both good and bad; a stiff board is more responsive and stable under speed where the flexibility of a bamboo for instance while "softening" the ride can also exacerbate unwanted flex and rebound, wobbles.

 I haven't taken it to completely empty yet, I have not had much time to ride it considering weather, but when it came it and I charged it it took somewhere around 3 hours to get to 95%. Also, I noticed it says 100% charge, but when I turn it on it says 95%. So I'm not sure where the inaccuracy is. I'm not sure if you have seen this as well or not. 

Do your motors have different resistance to them when you spin the wheel by hand? 
Also, if you lay the board upside down, hit the throttle and let go does the one motor stop before the other?

Dual VESCs via can bus support a feature called traction control.  The VESC on the outer wheel will give that wheel less torque than the one on the inner wheel.  It will also cause a different rate of spin with no torque applied.

Nice to see you guys testing out the boards. @Gizmo @itsgreekpete

**BELT TIGHTNESS -** As for belt tightness, you can adjust it. It's fairly tight because I prefer enjoy it tighter when riding. You shouldn't have any issues with belt skip since we use a 16T/36T.

**HEIGHT & WHEEL WELLS -** The height is slightly higher but we have some new longer trucks which should allow you to drop it lower again. I'll look into the rear mounting option for those who want a real low rider.

GBOMB FAIL - Tried the Gbomb but Gbomb doesn't fit. We only have the old school bolt holes on our setup and Gbomg specifically uses new school mounting holes only. Doubt a lot of people would use them though Gbombs were $200 bucks for 2x.

@ArmandR - Most of these issues are almost fixed. We're just waiting on longer trucks.

@itsgreekpete - You can check the belt tension. One belt can possibly be tighter than the other.

@delduked - Derek the guy in the video was using our Dual Hub Motor with 130KV on 12S3P EPOWER Pack. He's since went 4WD and is using a custom pack from Bara with a higher cont amp rating.

**MORE TORQUE, LESS TOP SPEED -** @Gizmo If you want more torque (less top speed), you can increase start-up boost & use a 13T/16T option. We use only one gearing option so you'd have to pick the best for what you plan on using it for.

**RIDING FATIGUE -** The longer trucks definitely help with vibration and having a much softer ride as well.

**CHARGING -** For charging, you go by the actual charger (green/red) vs looking at the battery % indicator. The charger is more accurate. Battery indicator is more of a guideline but it fluctuates when in use.

When will the longer trucks be available for order?
Also from what I see, if one were to lower the boards, they'd be rubbing against the motor mounts. I'm already having that issue without lowering the board. So the rear mount might be the way to go.

@itsgreekpete - You can use a 2.5mm Hex Key (longer T tool style) works best. Just loosen the 4x M4 bolts that hold the motor up and you can slightly hold the motor forward to tighten the belt or push it inwards to loosen it.

You want just enough slack that a belt won't skip teeth under pressure (ex. braking, accelerating).

For all of those who are wondering about rear mounting the motors. I tried to do this, but was personally unhappy with the clearance. There is enough clearance no doubt, just not up to MY standards. I just ordered a set of the 285mm belts. I am thinking that with these belts it should be doable. I will post updates as soon as I get it working. Unfortunately I did not take pictures (I did it very late at night and just wanted to get it over with). Once the new belts come in and I try again, I'll post some pictures.

I did use the existing components. Unfortunately I have reversed the set up back to normal, with the motor sitting slightly lower just to see if the board rub stops. I'm waiting for the 280mm belts to come in, hopefully those let the motor sit high enough on the mount for a proper rear mounting. The belts are too short to have it move high up enough. Another issue I had was the motor ever so slightly hit the kingpin bolt. I tried move the mounts further outward on the truck but with no luck. The circular bracket that the mount is bolted to won't move even after removing every possible screw from it. When I get the longer belts in, I'll take a picture of everything and post it up here for everyone to see :)

I was looking at that kingpin bolt and thought about clearance. I've been researching either a drop bracket or using a tkp truck in the rear. Obviously that will require a new mounting system. I may just gut this board and use a different deck. This deck needs either carvon's hub drives or some other hub drive utilizing wider trucks.

I used 8 mil clear vinyl and temporary weatherproofing latex caulk. The rocker switch sticks out so I created a slight bubble in the vinyl. The only hole in the vinyl is the power port. I opened the hatch and applied the caulk underneath to act as a glue for the vinyl sheet. I also applied a thin layer of sealant at the edges of the hatch for extra waterproofing. After replacing the hatch and cutting the hole I applied a second layer of caulk to the edges of the window and the power port with my finger working the sealant into any openings. The caulk applied white but dries clear. It isn't very pretty upon closer inspection but does the job. Also, with the hatch open I dumped a bunch of sealant (which expands) into the opening where the wires enter the electronics housing. I chose to use seal-n-peel temporary due to the fact that I may want to reconfigure the board in the future or just make the mod cleaner looking.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/4/9413609e965df8ae2c770e298cc0e639567241e3.jpg" width="281" height="500">

FreeFlow is pre-configured in FOC. Dual is pre-configured in BLDC although you can use FOC/Sensored. I like the Dual BLDC mode a bit better but FOC/Sensored is pretty awesome in itself once you try it.

Thanks for all the feedback for those whom shared their feedback. I'll be definitely looking into it.

Waiting to test the longer trucks which would be a nice benefit for those who have the Dual.. I'll check to see perhaps we can use an adapter which allows us to mount the Hub Motors on it too which will be nice.

I just ordered 98a (hard) bushings to replace the stock ones and will be changing the motor mount angle slightly. I'm considering flipping the motors and mounting them on the back. The damage to the deck due to the mounts is really starting to bother me.

Hey @Gizmo! Thanks for posting your possible solutions. Have you or @itsgreekpete tried adding an 1/8, 1/4 or 1/2 in riser to the board to see if that helps any? I know most people want the board as low as possible so maybe you guys don't want to raise it up a bit. 

The motor mounts scratching the deck would not do for me either. We will have to find a solution... I noticed you are going hard with the bushings... yikes!! I am only 130 lbs and I usually ride bushings that are around 80a or even softer. I almost always have to swap bushings on anything I ride. I can't imagine putting hard bushings in there to solve the problem. That seems like it would kill the "feel" of the board and make it so carving is not enjoyable. Please let me know how it goes for you! Basically if I'm understanding correctly, if I like my trucks set up loose to carve, then I'm definitely going to get some damage to my board from the mounts rubbing??  Sounds like that's the case. 

Thanks again guys and Dexter @torqueboards for trying to find solutions. You rock!! 🤘

The board itself is pretty tall already, and putting risers on it to make it even taller wouldn't be ideal, at least for me. Mounting the motors on the back would solve both the deck run, and allow the board to be dropped. A win/win scenario.

Alright! My dual arrived. Looks nice but I won't dare ride this thing with its current setup 🤕  Besides the back motor mounts touching the deck when you lean on it, the worse issue is the front wheels biting the board. I weigh 130 lbs. I'm a skinny s**t... and if I can barely lean on the board before the front wheels touch the deck then there is a big problem. 

The immediate solution would be an extra 1/2" maybe even 9/16" risers... but that would make this the tallest eboard I've ever stepped foot on and would compromise any stability at speed. @torqueboards hi Dexter, are your test riders lighter than me? I don't know how anyone who weighs more than 100lbs could ride this board without getting wheel bite. Please let me know in a PM or in this thread what your idea is to make this board rideable.  

To change bushings and tighten trucks is obvious, but then you won't have a fun board to ride anymore.  I'll let some of my eskate friends see the board this evening and see if we can come up with some ideas. 

Cheers guys!

@DaviDjembe - Are you leaning on it non-riding or riding? Typically, non-riding you lean more than if your actually riding. I'm 180 and have no wheelbite. 1/2" more riser seems too much. You can adjust the motor mount to face slightly lower which will fix the motor mount from hitting the deck.

Thanks for your quick reply, man. I wasn't riding at speed I was just standing on it to test it out. But I know bite when I see it. I like to carve and I know I don't have enough clearance here. Locking down the trucks and replacing the bushings is fine if you want to go straight and fast. But that's only half the fun :) I'll spend some time tonight and I'll see what I can come up with.

Good morning guys... it was a long hard journey in the workshop last night trying to get my dual Rocket goin. I finally did it and I am somewhat pleased with the result. 

Long story short I got my board to be rideable after numerous bushing swaps, truck adjustments and most importantly....... Risers.  I had to add an additional 1/4" (at least) so I didn't get wheel bite in the front when I turn the board while carving. The problem with the motor mounts touching the deck could not be solved without raising the trucks further off the deck. At least I couldn't find a solution. The amount of clearance needed so the motor mounts don't hit the deck was much more than I could squeeze out by simply adjusting the height of the mounts. I'll post updates and pictures for anyone who cares what I did to get my dual rocket safe and rideable 🤙

My board rides tall now, it's not low to the ground by any means. But at least now I can carve the hell out of it and not get wheel bite. I was still able to maintain stability at 25 mph. I've not tried to go faster than that yet :sweat_smile:

Cheers guys, I hope you get your Rockets up and running! If you can do it without adding risers... please let me know how you did it! Haha 

On a different note... the electronics, VESC settings, hardware and fit and finish are impeccable on the Rocket! The acceleration curve is insanely smooth and the breaking is exactly where it should be. Unfortunately it took me forever to realize how well this board performs because I couldn't even stand on the thing without the wheels hitting the underside of the deck. Risers guys... risers lol

@itsgreekpete yeah, you can take the CF riser off the back truck for sure. I had the trucks off last night trying to get my setup right and noticed it's just an extended riser to make it so you can set your board down and not scratch it. 

Having said that, if you take the back riser out you're gonna be screwed on motor mount/board clearance! I had to add additional 1/4" riser to front and back so I could turn without getting pitched off from wheel bite. Good luck man!

Hey guys..

I was testing out a bunch of options to try and shorten the ride height of the setup. At the end of the day though, personally I valued a shorter board by 3" versus 20mm in height. That's particularly the reason why this setup is slightly higher but personally.. I don't notice it too much.

I also tested w/ the longer trucks which I'll have available but the height seemed to only be about 20mm difference which is about .75" to 1".

You can see the difference in this photo here.
LEFT - Current setup.
RIGHT - w/ new longer trucks.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/e/dec336bb44b14bf3fc0aa6c02b17f8c5f686ccbd.jpg" width="690" height="225">

So if you wanted to mount on a rear mount it would be about the same height as the right side photo.

Here's a few photos with the longer trucks. They're huge lol

**Conclusion**
But yeah... I don't think there's not too much we can do for the height.

We would want a different style which would result in a a 36-37" deck.

I do want to release another deck in the near future. Could be another option.

Anyhow, looking forward to hear everyone's opinions.

@itsgreekpete - Yeah, you can remove the carbon fiber but be careful not to put your board on the end otherwise you'll scratch up the Carbon Fiber.

You can use 9mm belts if you want.

Putting in my vote for a new deck shape option being #1 priority. It looks like for people who want to carve hard currently - risers have to be added even with the regular trucks and probably can't remove as many as you did for the wider ones. Seems to me that a slightly longer deck with some actual shaping/cutouts around the wheels would improve things dramatically. Can't get wheelbite if there isn't deck there to bite!

Guess maybe I should wait until I have mine before I form too strong of an opinion about the height. I've just been on some taller boards before and found it to not be anywhere near as enjoyable as my drop-through boards.

@trappar - Yeah, most definitely one deck won't fit the ideal for "everyone". Personally, I don't notice the height and I do like shorter height boards as well. I can carve pretty well w/ the current setup but yeah you do need risers.

The main purpose for the TORQUE Rocket was to be a short 33" deck. Mostly compact and easy to store great for commuting.

At max we can drop it .75" but is 3/4" inch worth it.. Ideally, it might be closer to 1/2" as you'd want more clearance. To me, 1/2" doesn't seem like much at all.

You could use the longer trucks and run Dual 5065's on rear.

In the near future, I plan on having a 38-40" downhill carving setup similar to Evolve's Carbon GT with a 12S4P setup. The deck would have to prevent all wheel bite if that's what you wanted.

All of these criticisms would be a non issue if the wheel cutouts were deeper and placed properly and the deck wasn't as thick where the motor mounts rub. It would solve the ride height, wheel bite, and deck damage complaints. The only other thing is the wide open hole in the top of the deck and the grip tape details rubbing off.

I'm not involved in this and this post may seem a little bit off topic, but it's very cool to see a company develop products starting from criticisms directly from people.
Just an advice: I personally would use hub motors only with that short deck, to create the most compact and light board possible, adding deeper coutouts to avoid wheel bite. 
For satellite motors lovers, just make a longer evolve style deck as a different product. Compact boards and big motors with big wheels don't go too well together.

Overall, I love the size and shape of the deck. I just wish the wheel cutouts matched where the wheels actually meet the deck and there was more clearance where the motor mounts meet the deck. The only other issues that aren't directly related to those are the big open hole in the top (not weatherproof) and the very cool looking grip tape logo that is rubbing off. I almost feel like a solid clear grip tape over either a painted or decal logo would stand up to abuse better. All in all, like I said, the board is nice looking and is a beast in terms of electronics performance.

@Gizmo - The wheel cutouts were meant for our 220mm truck. The wheel well fits well with our longer trucks but at the end of the day. This setup wasn't meant to be a drop through low to the ground deck. It wasn't designed for that. The wheel wells would otherwise take up part of the enclosure.

The deck is thick for a reason. To hide the enclosure and maximize size. The motor mounts take up about 3" of space. Without setting it up how it is in it's current state. We would need to extend it 3" longer by doing that it's an entirely different deck.

Would people clarify? Is a .75" ride height that much of a difference? Personally, I don't notice it much. I'd prefer the current 33" size over a 36" size anyday. I'm fine w/ the ride height because of it.

As far as the grip tape.. It's been enlarged and will only read the logo + TORQUE. I removed the boards as those pieces were much smaller. We could color it white but I'm not to fond of the look.

As for the hole on top. We're working on a waterproof cover for it still testing but we'll let everyone know when it's completed. For the logo we'll send you a new plate once we get them finished.

@SirDiff - We do use hub motors with this setup as well they do help w/ the motor mount biting but that can easily be adjusted. Hub motors don't weigh any lighter than a typical outrunner. Ideally, it will weigh more as we increase the sizes of the hub motors to increase performance.

Light board + performance doesn't work. Batteries weigh what they weigh. If you want a lighter board it will be a 20mph setup with a smaller battery pack. You have to cut weight somehow.. Going smaller is typically the answer.

This board was meant to climb hills and to be compact. I'd want this for my daily commute in San Francisco. You can't maneuver quickly with an Evolve sized deck walking around with tons of people.

Compact boards and big motors with big wheels don't go too well together. - I think it works.. you just have to go slightly higher for the ride height.

I personally have no wheel bite at all, but I'm not using it for insane carves or anything. I shifted weight left and right to try and had a buddy look underneath he also saw no bite at all. @torqueboards I am still interested in those longer trucks with a rear mount. I'm even considering smaller wheels if that's possible? I'm used to low riding decks, and compared to what I'm used to I dont feel as stable. As I've mentioned before all in all great board. Keep up the amazing work.

@torqueboards @gizmo 

The 280mm belts aren't enough. They let the motor go to the end of the mount. However, a longer mount might be needed. At the very least, longer trucks so the motor could move away from the truck about an inch. Definitely will be getting those longer trucks from you once they're in.

So, here's just a little afterthought: I came to the conclusion that the soft durometer of the bushings were part of the issue. When you crank down the kingpin nut to control the wheel bite issue, the soft bushings compress so much that they actually create more motor mount grinding issues. Of you loosen the kingpin you solve the motor mount issues but then you get an unstable ride. I have ordered harder bushings to hopefully solve this and I will be switching out the clone wheels for real abec 11s in order to resolve the harder riding issue created by using harder bushings. I will post my findings once I put it all together and do some testing.

You can also try running it on sensored FOC for better start-up. You would need sensor wire adapters for VESC.

So, I did a bit of testing. I put the harder larger bushings on and the stock smaller bushings on duplicating front and back. This created a higher pivot point without totally sacrificing rebound. The results so far are pretty good. I have not experienced any motor mount grinding or wheel bite as of yet. I want to do some more intensive testing but with more protective gear on as I plan to try some exaggerated carving to test the boundaries. I did slightly change the motor mount angles as well. I switched the motors to FOC mode and and am happy with the results. I still plan on changing the trucks to the 220 mm and the wheels to real Abec 11's.

I noticed two sets of threaded holes on either side of the board. Will the handles you sell in the site by chance hook up to these ?

Finally got my own range test done. I have a 12s3p battery and was able to get 12 miles. @Gizmo did your board cut out before reaching 0? Mine cut out around 12% or 14% I dont quite remember which of the two. Also with bushings I changed my bottom barrel to a 97.5A riptide bushing on the bottom 95A riptide BARREL on the top for the rear truck. For the front truck, I changed to bottom to a 95A riptide barrel, and left the top stock cone bushing. Speed wobbles gone, even after letting go of the throttle at high speeds. I weight 146 pounds. No motor bite on the board, and it turns great.

@willpark16 It is the Rocket Dual. It is not running hubs. Maybe I accidentally received at 10s3p? I dont know if there's a way to differentiate between the two.

@Gizmo . Outside temperate about 60-65 degrees. Cruising speed between 15-20 mphs, i hit one or two hills, but low grade. I'd call them slight inclines rather than hills, about a city block to two each. A few stops to let some cars pass by, I'd say 6 total.

@itsgreekpete - Mostly, by size. You got a 12S3P. 12S3P should take up almost the entire space in the enclosure area. Was your setup charged to 100%? You waited until the charger led was "green". You should get anywhere from 15-20 miles depending on how hard you throttle.

**Grab Handle** - The one on the website right now won't work for the TORQUE Rocket currently. I just tested a prototype one so we'll have some available soon.

@delduked - They're almost here :)

Take up the enclosure as far as length is concerned? If that's the case yea no doubt it's a 12s3p. Throttle wise my speed was between 15-20mph. Charge was definitely full. Ill get another go at it.

Range test #12

I avoided any and all hills. Only slight inclines in the road. 96% straight road. 2% incline 2% decline (yes i did the math, I went back the way i came). 13.3 miles was what I got. Max speed was 31 mph for .2 miles. The rest of the way was between 10-20 mph. Few stops, I just let off the throttle for the board to kind of just slow down, pinch of brake into 45 turns. 13.3 miles is what I got out of the board. I even google mapped the route just to check it wasn't the app itself. 
Going to be doing a third one literally going up and down the same street until the board shut off. It's a level street. 

@gizmo Have you done a proper range test taking the battery down until it shuts off from low power?
```

For me, range tests are difficult due to the cold weather. It would be unfair to make a fair assessment. Unfortunately, I had to send the battery back as it was having intermittent issues turning on under load. The other ongoing issue I was having with the battery was the ridiculously long recharge times. Dexter @torqueboards was very helpful and will be sending a New battery out. I will wait to do a range test when temperatures are above 60f. As far as your issue goes, I feel like there is another factor involved.  Is there a lot of resistance when you turn the wheels by hand?

@Gizmo I'm not quite sure what is normal resistance and what isn't. I'm sure a certain amount is to be expected. Nice to hear they took care of your battery issue! 

 When you get a chance to do a proper range test, could you let me know your results? I'm going to try a third one on a completely level street and just go back and forth doing 20 and measure it that way.

How long were your charge times? ive had mine on for  4.5 hours and am at 55%. I'm using the 2a charger.

## \#215 Posted by: Gizmo Posted at: 2017-03-28T03:54:03.215Z Reads: 135

Try testing going at about a 15 mph cruising speed or about a half to 3/4 trigger pull. Also make sure you are pushing off and not starting from a standing stop. When you are coasting after releasing the throttle on flat ground, do you slow quickly or freewheel for a bit?

It was taking about 6-7 hrs from 50%, when I drained it to 25% it took over 11 hrs to charge. There was definitely a problem with the battery from the start. Hopefully, the new battery will perform properly. I used a 2a charger as well.

Hey everyone!  So, I thought it'd be appropriate to post a video :movie_camera: [here](http://bit.ly/DIYSKATEBOARDREVIEW).  I've started a YoutTube channel that gives a **high level** perspective of the diy scene (tips, vendors, & community news).  This particular video illustrates purchasing parts or a complete build from @torqueboards My target :golf:audience is diyers new to the community that may not have found the forum or good resources for their first build.  I thought I'd post this here since it focuses on Torque Boards and both his Rocket Freeflow and Rocket Dual which I was able to test ride :sunglasses:  Both of them are great boards! Anyhow, hope you enjoy and feel free to like/subscribe to my channel. (sorry if this seems like spam)

Hey man. You might want to try adjusting the angle of the motors to be slightly lower, and getting some harder bushings on the board side of the truck. Then you can get rid of the larger riser on the rear. Unfortunately you can only get rid of one of the small risers up front because of wheel bite, but it makes the board level either way (I used a level to check).

Hey man! Thank you so much for your advise. I actually did that when I first got the board and adjusted the motor mounts to be slightly lower to the ground. I think I read that you swapped the motors to the back side of the board... how did that work for you? Did you revert back to the original set up? The performance of the rocket is right on but the deck design has proven to be less than ideal if you're looking for a balance between slower speed carving and going straight and fast. This board does the "straight and fast" thing really well... but I haven't given up on this board yet. I'm hopeful the new trucks will give us dual rocket owners some decent options for setup.
```

I reversed. It back to the original mount. The rear mount wasn't really ideal, it gave less clearance to the ground than having it mounted under the board. Now I'd be able to drop the board a bit more, but the front end has wheel bite if any more than one small riser is removed.
Street side you left the stock cone bushing on?

That was a very good review. I too find myself in this weird zone of thinking the board is great to knowing that getting to amazing is an effort. I've come to the conclusion that all the parts are great but that they don't necessarily fit with each other great. I changed my bushings out, will most likely get the wider trucks so I can remove some risers, changed to FOC mode, will probably change to softer abec 11 wheels, and am eagerly awaiting Tb's solution to the open top port. I love the board but right now she's a high maintenance diva.

It rides heaps better with the longer trucks though and the height really isn't an issue. A lot more stable with the longer trucks.
