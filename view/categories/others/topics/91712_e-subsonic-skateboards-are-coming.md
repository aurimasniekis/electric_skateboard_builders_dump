dope deck, dope components... yeah looks legit.  I am sure it will cost a nice sum, but you will have a quality board!  It looks like they took the best(or near best) components from the DIY community and created a killer product.

Now if they get @Sender to skin these bitches.... you will have liquid fire on your hands!


--- on a side note, what motors are those?  6355 Maytech(custom)

What makes you think they are custom?  Smooth black cans would be the MTO6355 170HA-C

Interesting. psycho mounts, marcmt88 wheel hubs and I assume gears.

Anyway, this is great news, more old school high end niche longboard companies getting into the pool.

This part's a little weird (@Subsonic_Paul)

Standard Batteries: 10S4P Samsung 30Q 

Upgrade Batteries: 12S3P Samsung 30Q 
[/quote]

40 cells for standard, 36 cells for the "upgrade".

eboosted's page says the enclosure fits 13s5p (65 cells) 18650. or 12s4p (48) 21700. I can see not wanting the enclosure jammed full for production/custom boards, but there's plenty of room for say 12s4p 18650.

I'm sure everything's early stages though.

motors used in the video measure 6368 pretty sure they are racestars.   The board is subsonics demo board and wanted to try the motors see how they run and how long it will last.   For at least 10 first boards will have flipsky 6354s 190kv.

Thanks my brother.  We're not working with Subsonic, yet please know we sincerely wish this venture every success for the future.

Our community always benefits from fair competition as it helps produce higher-quality (and safer) stuff, for us all.  

I think these look terrific.  @adman's builds are tried-and-true, @marcmt88 's wheels are great and Alan @Eboosted seems to be unable to produce an ugly board across his entire line.  Go to eBoardsperu.com and show me the ugly one - you can't.

A lot of us saw the potential for the 40" Subsonics a long time ago.  We applaud @adman for realizing this venture with @Subsonic_Paul.  Congrats guys :)

The battery description is now corrected.  When i explained that the 12s had more torque and speed they asumed it was an upgrade.    As of the number of cells that we are using i asumed how subsonic just started to electry im went with smaller/lighter/cheaper way with the packs.   Next line they will have more options.

I think @Eboosted's will come out very similar. That one :point_up_2: I believe is @adman's.

I hoped this to happen one day, and it does today ! thank's guys !

Here is a (background) video of the feeling I get with my Century 40 DH board in action : http://www.eriderz.org

I hope I could have the same on flat with this e-Century 40 !

I fear I'm not on the good continent ;) but thank's anyway.

If ever it will be possible to have a demo somwhere in Europe in the future, why not ! I'd be happy to help at this if I can.

One feature I'd suggest is the possibility to limit the top speed in a range between 15 to 40 mph.

A law was recently passed here in France limiting the speed of individual electrical vehicules to 15 mph in urban areas.

Furthermore, I've discussed with skateshop owners around me, and they're okay to sell such power-boards if the top speed limit can be set to low values, and tuned afterwords by the owner of the board according to his/her skills.
