It looks like it only has 2 longboard wheels.  :confused:  4 longboard wheels is much, much better.

My #1 and #2 most important criteria are both "Reliability".  This looks just like a Meepo or Harvoo or Ownboard or Wowmeepgo or Wowgo or Hyperboard.

What happens when I ride through brine and broken glass with this?  Would you like me to test it?

I will say my Meepo was a great deal for what I paid for it, as a board to have for friends to ride. The hub urethane is junk, but other than that itâ€™s ok, has great torque for climbing hills, and nice and powerful brakes.

What makes me me mad more than anything is that these companies must think weâ€™re stupid, like we arenâ€™t gonna notice itâ€™s a clone, and we arenâ€™t gonna notice itâ€™s cheap quality. Everyone on here builds their own boards. We know shitty quality when we see it. 

That and they fact that they treat this as an ad board. Itâ€™s a builders forum and spamming ads adds nothing to the community!

I think deleting the entire pre-built section isnâ€™t necessary as itâ€™s interesting to compare DIY to prebuilt, and many people DIY-hack their prebuilts. 

I do think posts that serve no purpose other than to advertise a new product should be banned. Isnâ€™t it frowned upon to just straight up advertise a brand or product on this forum anyway?

Perhaps the only exception would be if the company was willing to send a few experienced members of the forum Boards to review, and then we could allow a thread on that brand to hear the reviewers opinions on the Boards

experienced members do not want to ruin their reputations by even being associated with such boards..this is a DIY forum, to me if it doesn't have anything to do with DIY building it has no place here..there's a pile of sell-outs and groups loaded with spam all over facebook, and redit is loaded with it too..they have their place, they can keep it over there..and modding a pile of shit, it like just pushing it around on the ground a little..it is still what it is..wishing for quality and wanting this industry to grow and become something more intrinsic than the desire of a factory to make money means we must point out the truth..there must be a bastion of people who want more, who want better and demand it or else we will never get it...I hate to sound so negative all the time, and I wish I didn't have too..but my feeds and notifications are being overrun with bullshit and frankly it turns me off to electric skateboarding entirely..

also i believe the pre build should not be deleted as a category,  there are some pretty damn decent builders out there and if they decide to make a run at it, this would be the best place to start in my opinion plus can be influenced by members to improve on a design... or like whats happening to Teemo and their clones...

I think this is an interesting topic so far...

A year ago, I was amazed when meepo came along, sold this board, and everyone loved it. Still to this day, I hear a lot of praise of meepo and very little complaining.

But the reality is these boards hurt the industry. Let me explain a little... I almost have every part I need for completes secured in a supply chain. After 2.5 years of development with hummie of the hub motors, and 2 years of hollow core deck development, I'm almost ready to enter the complete market. But I also realized that I need more funding. So my plan, being in SF, is to start contacting VC's and angel investors to gain more funding. But here's the problem I face. These guys are claiming 20 miles of range and 26 mph top speed. Total BS, but now when I go into a meeting, they will ask me "Why does a $200 board get more range than your $2500-3000 board?". Either I join the party and claim 40 miles range (knowing that for me, it's still more like 12 miles in the hills of SF), or I have to explain why everyones range numbers are total bs. Either way, a what, 180 wh battery is not doing 20 miles while my 604 wh battery does 12 miles...

I'm glad to see people catching on and speaking up about it. The boards make it harder for community builders to start a company building quality boards.

$200 board get more range than your $2500-3000 board
[/quote]

I would think talking to an investor would be talking to someone who understands luxury and performance cars. I used to drive a 1992 Honda Accord as a idiotic teenager. That speed gauge went up to like 120 or 130mph. On an open road to Vegas I got the needle to max out, the car was shaking, but like I said, idiotic teenage. Does this mean I was driving a performance car just because I did 120+ mph with a $17,000 car?

The point is, all vehicles takes you from point A to point B that doesn't mean the same thing? Comparing a Meepo to ever a Boosted with less range doesn't make sense as they are different class, especially when you are talking about quality, durability and most importantly safety.

In order to succeed in this market, you need to sell the best tools, or the shittiest toys that last for 3 days.  Teemo chose the second one.  When folks ask you for advice about how to fix their broken bullshit, charge them for it or don't offer your time for free.  It was their decision to ride around on only 2 longboard wheels.

In this game, quality is directly related to safety...and we are putting up with some very unsafe crap out there..what happens is the public, or future consumers, will believe this is the standard of our industry, they will ruin all prospective buyers before anything of quality sees the light of day or lands an investor because the market is saturated with bullshit and the consumers all walk around already talking about what crap eskates are..Skateboarders themselves are some of this industries worse enemies because of it..it is a problem and looking the other way will only make it worse...all we need to do is speak to it when it pops up so the more naive audiences at least see it...if someone is ignorant to the facts and make a poor choice, whatever...but if they see all this talk and then go and blow funds on a disposable pile of crap..then it's on them...but we have a responsibility to say something..just like we have a responsibility to remind people to wear helmets...

The same goes for any of you vendor beggars, you know it's shit but you'll have it for free so your unbiased opinion can vertically move markets that your social media presence has the umpph to do, that is if the vendor has your mom, your best bud Joe and a few others to build market on

It's shit let's just leave it at that

I think this is a good idea and should apply to the forums in general. If you act like tech support, people are going to treat you like tech support. 

Too many posts with people asking questions without using the search funcation, those that point this out are ignored, and eventually someone helps them with their problem and they never return to the forum except when they have another problem. 

If we stop responding to ads and stop acting like tech support, then the forum will be a better place.
