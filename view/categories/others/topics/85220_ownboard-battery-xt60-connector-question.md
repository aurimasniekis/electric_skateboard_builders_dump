I’m trying to research about whether Ownboard’s 10s2p Samsung 30Q 6.0Ah battery uses the male or female xt60 connector. can you guys help me figure it out please?

I am trying to use this battery to power a belt drive, but my vesc has an xt90 male connector in it! I found some adapters between xt90 and xt60. My problem is simply that I cannot figure out which way I need the adapter to go. I need it to have xt90 female connection on the vesc side, but what kind of xt60 connection do i need on the battery side? Basically, I want to know if the long xt60 wire that runs through the board *into the esc enlosure*  is male or female.

I am specifically asking about the part that *ends up in the esc case* , that is the part that I will be using the adapter with to attach with my male xt90 vesc.

So my adapter will be (male/female?) xt60 to female xt90, in order to connect the long wire (female/male?) that ends in the esc case into my new vesc(male). Thank you for your help.

Battery packs usually come with a female connector. If its a male connector, if by any scenario a small piece of metal or paperclip drops in and connects the two pins, boom.
