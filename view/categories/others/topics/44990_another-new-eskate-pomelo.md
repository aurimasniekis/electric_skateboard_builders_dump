Instagram thought I should look at it so I'm showing you guys. Seems nice but I feel like it's going to be another underwhelming project that won't do what it claims to. Based on a lot of the other new boards coming out. It would be cool if they can make the claims happen.

They ride it through water, says it has the longest battery life, 26mph...

Scam.
JK. Although it's kind of suspicious how you can fit that many 18650's in that little enclosure and I don't know about climbing 17-degree hills in dual hubs. Just my opinion :stuck_out_tongue: I prefer belt drives for now.

It's funny how they're going to do a kickstarter thing on a board that's already made lol.

They probably meant 23 miles with extra modular battery packs sold separately.

When you start your range test high atop Bullshit Mountain, it's a looong way to the bottom, so anything is possible.ðŸ—» I'm surprised they claimed ONLY 23 miles. I like the fact that their Egregious Claims Department has some restraint and self respect. Very confidence inspiring. â›½

17% grade hill climbing ability seems pretty honest...I wonder why they didnâ€™t just say 40% 

Also I donâ€™t see any bearings on the front wheels
