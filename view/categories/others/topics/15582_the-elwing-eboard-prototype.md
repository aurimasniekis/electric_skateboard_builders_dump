```
So the wheels get too hot to touch from riding on flat ground and slight hills? What about puttng it through 10-20
% grade hills for 30 minutes straight like I have to ride to my university?

Drop outs also?

These motors look very similar to the may tech motors. Can anyone confirm which re-branded motors these are?
