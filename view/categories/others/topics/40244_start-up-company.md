Hi eskate builders.  I have been around the forums quite a bit over the last year, and am looking to start my own business with electric skateboard/longboards.  I'm looking to see what the community desires in an electric skateboard, like;

1 - Deck shape
2 - Type of concave
3 - Kicktail or no Kicktail
4 - Hub motors or belt driven
5 - Battery range (how much battery life would you prefer)
6 - Swapable batteries or non swapable batteries
7 - Desired price range (with reason)

Thanks

Elijah

I'd highly recommend reading some more, there are a considerable few areas that could use improvement but without understanding the basics you will have difficulty very quickly, you've only visited thirteen days and haven't made any comments with very little activity. You need to first know your audience before designing a product you know little about

Hi Will, I have been on the forums more than 13 days.  I had to change my account.  I am aware of the various issues with electric skateboards out on the market.  I just wanted some direct feedback on what most people prefer.  Therefore i can make a better product.

questions you're asking is kind of like asking what flavor of ice cream is the best. everyone will have their own opinion but in the end you still get to eat ice cream. 

you kind of have to deliver what you believe in and hope the market responds.

[/quote]

Which community?  This one here will desire totally different things.

To save some research, I can tell you what the masses want to buy:

1) does deck shape matter?
2) what's concave?
3) kicktails look cool
4) what's the difference?
5) 100 miles or more
6) I don't want to fiddle with taking stuff apart, it's for my nephew
7) $125.00 absolute maximum

And I can tell you what some folks here want to buy:

1) depends what the purpose of the board is.  Usually a drop-through longboard or a Jet Spud shape
2) elliptical concave
3) see 1).  Usually no kicktail
4) belt drive or axial direct drive, never hub motors (radial direct drive)
5) 432 watt * hours
6) not swappable
7) $800 - 2800
```

This is what's important to me when dealing with vendors here:

[quote="ElijahGainer, post:1, topic:40244"]

1 - Deck shape (You should already know this)
2 - Type of concave (Have you ever ridden a skateboard?)
3 - Kicktail or no Kicktail (Do you know the difference between streetskating and longboarding?)
4 - Hub motors or belt driven (Belts!!)
5 - Battery range (how much battery life would you prefer) (Can you actually make a battery?)
6 - Swapable batteries or non swapable batteries (Alibaba much?)
7 - Desired price range (with reason) (Let me guess, $750?)

You're asking a community full of DIY builders. Not to mention, you can't just have a esk8 company and not know what your market is. What's your target market? Who's the consumer you are trying to sell too? What price bracket do you want to compete in? You need to know these details to have an outline that basically says "okay, here's my target consumer persona, and here's what the persona is looking for in a board". My advice? Find your target market first. then come back here and ask what would be a good design decision.

Personally I love a 50" board with 150mm urthane tyres with truck suspention.  dual Vesc7.3 setup 12s8p with a 8-30 gear ratio.  

for the board it needs to be made out of bamboo like boosteds, but be jet back with carbon fibre.

motors need to be a minimum of 7264, or 8080 @ about 220Kv and handle 90Acont just like the Vesc. \s

Here's what everyone wants as far as i can tell:

1) max top speed whatever "i can throw at it"
2) max range too because what's the point if i can't go as fast as possible for longer than possible. Need to do 50mph for at least 100 miles c'mon man can't you just strap a lipo on it or something but it better look amazing
3) it needs to be able to climb hills too at 50mph and oh yeah they weigh 270 pounds but theywork at the top of the hill and they can't charge it more than twice a week because @psychotiller's  mom needs the plugs for her giant vapes and backup beeper. 
4) they love the artwork and want to be able to see it and here's a picture of the cat they want on top but don't use clear grip because that gets dirty so maybe can't you just cut the grip around the cat or use colored cat grip or maybe just slap a cat on there they don't know they'll let me know in a couple weeks but they need it shipped tomorrow
5) backpack full of lipos
6) they really want the electric flywheels and money is no object. Doesn't matter if they're literally not available anywhere and basically no longer exist as a retail product anywhere legitimate, can't i just call chris or something, have i heard of the sharkwheels, what about these ones on amazon they found. 
7) they want to call you. They want to hear a person on the phone before they spend close to $3K on a board that will likely need adjustments specifically for their riding style and weight after the sale which can be a tad disappointing (i have to send it back? i just got it!) for a customer living in a culture of sell-it-and-forget-it mixed with everything-should-be-perfect-i'm-a-jaded-customer and a side of everything-is-changing-anyway-thanks-disruptive-millenials. 
8) they want you to make them feel special. Because they deserve it. They know they deserve it, and if they're giving you that kind of money, they do deserve it. So make them feel special. Give them the level of service just past what they expected and keep surprising them. They will tell their friends, you won't have to advertise. Advertising is a smelly game anyway, and the millennials, who are the ones buying everything right now, aren't fond of the traditional bullshit marketing approaches.
9) a company who can deliver and won't take orders without shipping anything until they're bankrupt or sued.  
10) it needs the biggest pack you've ever made but they need to be able to mall grab it and take it on a plane, can you just make it so i can put the cells in my wife's purse or something.


based on all of that, and all of the experiences i've had, There is no perfect board for everyone. 

compromises are going to have to happen. 

I would suggest targeting a 170 pound rider who enjoys a top speed of around 25mph but that's probably too scary for them so they'll likely keep it under 20 most of the time, but that spec is important. Also it need to do a minimum of 15 miles AT 25mph. with a 170 pounds on it. so you're looking at an evolve/raptor class board. that's 10S class. If you're lucky you can get a price point around $1900 and still make some money.

you will need at least 3 types of board. just like every car manufacturer out there with their low end Civic, mid tier Camry, and upper Lexus. Meepo boards from Kieran is a good example. he started selling low ends and now he has 3 types of boards. point is, people love having options if you wanna survive long term in this business.

i would consider myself a novice so here's my 7 answers to your questions
1- longboard. im riding a 39inches now and under 4.5 inches high for stability. 30" is too short for comfort
2- concave? i didnt know how many types there are
3- no kicktail, since i dont do tricks
4- hub motors. just cause they are soooo much more quieter. i dont want people's attention
5- 8 to 10 miles
6- it doesnt matter. but if i want to upgrade in the future, i should be able to use any lipos i want
7- low end $400 to $600 for something that can go at least 20mph and lasts at least 6months, with 5miles per day commute.  so doing the math that's at least 650 miles.  mid tier board from $700 to $1000 for something that can do 25mph and lasts 2000 miles.  upper tier board from $1300 to $2000 that can do 30mph and over 2500 miles.

hope that helps and gl!

That is beyond true. ITs very important to think about this and fully understand what it really means for your business. 

For me it means literally giving them what they ask for within reason and within the constraints of what's possible for their build. 

for you it probably means having on hand multiple power levels of drive systems and multiple decks/graphics to set them apart. That's what it will mean for me when i dip into non-custom completes in 2018. I'll be producing short runs of various types of boards for various weight classes and riding styles as a way of diversifying. Why? because something else they all want: delivery within a week of placing their order. Now that's something you can't do on a fully customized board designed for an individual. So, diversification.

What about the iphone and hyper cars. Nothing wrong with have a single awesome product. Of course there is always money in creating other peoples dreams.

At first I thought it was a good idea "cater" to my customers, but as it turns out, they don't know how to build anything which is why they ask us to build things for them in the first place. Boards have come along way. But not because they had better plans or designs. It's mostly because I stopped taking "orders". I build what I want!

LEts say that new driver for Ferrari was a career driver for somebody else before that, had good driving skills and a lot of experience driving and understood how things like suspension and handling should feel on a super car. 

Now you're getting closer to an accurate analogy for my particular customers. The input is valuable, but they still don't know crap about building them.

@psychotiller @longhairedboy yes indeed! The very best part of designing is the freedom to make choices and explore ideas. 

I love getting suggestions and requests, but ultimately my designs are good because I bring my own taste, experience, and knowledge into what I make. 

My favorite way to work is to communicage w someone to learn about how they'll use the deck, and what they already like. From there I can help to sort out what will work practically and what they'll love. 

Really it's all about designing what I love, so someone else can love it too!

@ElijahGainer  As you might have guessed, it's not that simple, everyone wants different things. Do your own research. I spent hours on the forum looking at almost everything, that gave me a rough idea about what people like/don't like.
Also, being an actual eskater helps a lot.

Meanwhile I'm still getting accused of selling a rebranded board. Literally someone typed, "[Predator Boards]  looks like they replaced the deck, battery, and ESC, and motors... however that's it. I don't think anyone will buy their rebranded board."

U WOT M8? It's a fucking skateboard, there's only so many things you can change to make the product unique. Anywho... this market dilution is rubbing people the wrong way and giving companies like mine some undeserved flak. What's worse, the ones that will rise out of this clusterfuck are the brands that offer the cheapest product since, to the untrained consumer, all these no-name boards are all the same sans the pricing.

That's true, although I think the fact that riptide doesn't try to hide this and is honest about it helps their perception a lot. That and the fact that they did somewhat make their board unique with their own deck, actual abec-11 wheels, and shred lights. 

What I don't understand is that for maybe $100 more per board, they could use VESCs and a really good product, but for some reason they don't.

somewhat make their board unique with their own deck, actual abec-11 wheels, and shred lights. 

What I don't understand is that for maybe $100 more per board, they could use VESCs and a really good product, but for some reason they don't.
[/quote]

well it was the shred lights guys so thats not surprising. $100x2 is more than the profit margin on something like that.
and the race video vs boosted was so suspect! 

I wouldn't even care but this is just straight lies!
what they say....

Well yeah if you've only tried an acton, a dual diyeboard kit, and a boosted board, the boosted is going to be the nicest in terms of control and build quality (snapped trucks?). I just feel if you've only ridden a boosted board, then you've only seen the tip of the iceberg.

If you've only ridden complete boards (besides the raptor 2), then you've only seen the tip of the iceberg, lol.

I hate watching these videos on youtube about how great some board is. "This is the fastest board ever", "This is the best board ever", and statements like that which are misleading, and not giving the customers a real comparision. I watched that second video @saul posted and that's a fair video. Most though, go and ride and are like, this is so powerful, while riding a one of the weaker boards on the market.

lol its call "click bait".
youtubers rely on those views!
I like that particular video because she is a regular boosted rider, and the other guy is a semi pro skater.
so you can see some realistic riding.

I've been on boosteds, stary(once) and a few customs, plus all the versions of my own.
@evoheyax still need to see what one of your 4wd beast would be like! ;)

I started with an Acton while waiting for the Boosted. Acton bored me and the short deck was awful. Boosted took too long so I built my first board. Now I’m three builds in and the Boosted is probably dedicated to my wife (if she streets her face it 100% not my fault). I think I’ve ridden it like 15 miles at most. It’s good, but being in this community I’ve learned too much to be held back by Boosted.

12 miles is annoying, but the worst to me is saying the "most powerful" part. Now when I want to actually sell powerful boards and other's selling powerful boards, the customer is confused because they don't know any better.

Powerful is a vague statement, but I can't see how they can even attempt to defend that in court since they are not the most powerful under any definition of power.

I suppose they could claim "brand power" or some unquantifiable metric like that. 

But I've seen at least 3 different companies claim to be the "most powerful". Which is BS that it happens with electric skateboards and no one seems to care. If the camaro and mustang and both claimed to be the "most powerful american car" then there would be a huge uproar.

"Sub highest voltage rating with 20/36 pulley ratio, this board broke my limit as I’ve never gone max current (speed). Rest assured this bad boy can go 30+mph. Hill climb can be a bit of challenge since I only have 2P LG HG2 and an ENSANE pulley ratio, but motor puley can be easily switched.

TB motors, mounts, and trucks, MayTech VESC and wheels, and my very own IOS/Bluetooth/Arduino control circuit App pair, this is about as high-end as you get as a DIY Esk8. I have ridden 120+ miles but only for leisure and exhibition since I live really close to everywhere.

If you are intrigued or DM me, ZackoryCramer, on www.electric-skateboard.builders for details"

No point, carry on soldering together your battery packs @ZackoryCramer and using your wealth of knowledge and experience to guide others in building there own eSk8 with parts from your e-store.

Ask yourself, do you think 120 miles is a lot?  I ride ten miles or more every single day, sometimes 50.  I use electric skateboards to get to work and to the grocery store and everywhere.

During the summer, I could do that on a weekend, no problem.
