Hi 

I'm really curious about this chinese electric skateboard, I already have on DIY tho, single drive 9mm belt. So quite a lack in torque and braking.
http://www.bisekcycle.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=116

I send him an email for more details, and this is what he responded :

> It's 61 KV motor.  The transmission is 1:1, no gear inside.

> The motor is fixed to axle by screws.

> The motor cannot go faster than 30 km/h because we set limitation on controller. If exceed the speed, the controller and motor will get very hot and unstable. 

> By the way, we use controller instead of ESC. The controller is developped specially for skateboard not that kind of ESC for RC planes. When you open the upper deck, you will see controller and battery. But we don't suggest do any change to the chip and battery.

> Check here for more hi-res photos here: https://goo.gl/photos/Jrq7V9SV3dAuTRNE8 

> Best Rgds,

> Rex

Are there more things that i could ask? I really like the design and style of the board. 
Not sure if I actually gonna spend this much money on it.

They are using an Acton controller. I stumbled upon this on Alibaba the other day, looks like a scam to me..

It's the same factory that produces the Blink Board, you can find this Board and some variations as PhantomGo, Raven, Bull R3000,...

Never heard of the Acton controller 

You mean the transmitter or the ESC? 

Is it not good or are you just trying to say they copied ?

There is a company called Acton that makes electric skateboards. The skateboard you linked uses an Acton controller (the thing u hold to control the speed).. I wouldn't bother wasting ur time and money on a cheap Chinese product no one has heard of or used

Sure, I will get time over the weekend to take a closer look.  Got it from Rex @ Bisek for $583 + $180 fedex to NYC address = $763 total.  Posted a few pictures in a separate thread but should move to here as better posting location.  Search forum for Bisek and should show up.

How's the ride? Most important things to me are:

1. Real world range
2. Regen brakes? Smooth brakes?
3. Water/splash proof?

Please let us know more when you get some riding time with it! 

P.S. Thanks for being the guinea pig. Hahaha just kidding

I received this answer from Rex on my mail: 

Hi Michael,
This is Rex from Bisek. Very glad to receive your inquiry.
Please check attached quotation sheet. Do you only need 1 piece? The price is $605 for 1 piece sample.
And shipping to Belgium: $198 by DHL air.
So it's $803 in total. And lead time is 30 days after payment.
You can check more real photos here: https://goo.gl/photos/Jrq7V9SV3dAuTRNE8

I wanted to wait for some reviews here :slight_smile: before ordering one. Also, if I have to pay import fee on this item, it will be as much as a evolve or boosted board. That would be to much

20% import taxes indeed. I live in belgium aswell .. 

Board looks really fancy though, and you would trade "known name" for "range" between boosted/bisek. 

Don't think anyone will buy this board except for @caustin. So reviews are not gonna come i'm afraid

Sorry I have not been able to post, have been in a trip the past week. Will be able to answer questions and post pictures etc after I get back in a few days. I am also waiting in the JBloy EWF dual hubs kit in black being shipped to me now, but may not be a simple swap out as the BISEK hubs are websites and carry extra leads from ESC to motors in addition to 3 phase leads. Also ESC is proprietary, and not really an ESC technically based in design choices they made. Short review is good for now, only issue working on is RX/tx dropout caused by antenna placement deck in CF and the realities of riding in NYC 2.4ghz interference etc lol. Speed is good, around 24moh but capped by ESC governor so that is programmed not physical limits. Engineers said it was to protect overheat hub motors, which is a typical concern. Hubs do heat up, but I keep forgetting to bring along a digital it thermometer to measure during use. Deck is nice, though top cover a thin material unlike rest of CF sturdy deck. Really like design of deck and hand grab etc. The thing is super stealth, being slim no obvious wiring, hub motors, everything black etc. 14 lbs and 35" so more portable than my other longer e-boards.  Torque is good so far but have not tested big inclines yet. Acceleration is good from a stop and smooth. Not much documentation, had to explore remote button sequence to switch to reverse, manual-ish Steez etc. Battery seems better than I would have guessed 10s 3p (can't remember exact p, lol). Wheels ok duro, not abecs or tangs but I have seen worse. Charges fast, have not had chance to measure range properly, and no voltmeter etc. Basically if I can get the remote RX/tx issue resolved it's a keeper.

I don't look at my budget , i'm just spending :) 

I already build my first board with single belt drive. and pretty ghetto enclosure. So now i'm going for a nice sweet stealth build. 
Probably will be spending 1000 +- 

I have mixed feelings about the VESC 6.0 because it will be in beta ? I'm planning on getting 2 hw4.12  vesc's from esk8.de

remote receiver under dual esc, typical setup, antenna looks like has been extended past spec for 2.4ghz bt (2"-ish) to try and get clear of CF blockage.  Unclear that is a good idea even if just rx.  No range testing yet.

@zeno: something new from rex about the deck manufacturer? 
The chance for being manufactured by bisek directly is reasonably low, I think. Because the Phantom Raven and Bulls R3000 seems to use exactly the same deck, so probably there is a third person making the decks. 
I have mailed to both of them and will share if they answer.

Hello every one ! This is felix from Bisek .Rex is my company .well ,thanks all of you pay close attention to this product .of cause ,the product is processing improve .now we improve 2.4G Wire antenna instead common wire .we realized the carbon fiber board can shield signal but enhance components is necessary. Another improvement is we instead controller .the controller is one pcb (previous double PCB connected) and is real sine wave controller .the resualt of testing is more silence and high explosive power. we will update new comparison video in recently.
we will continuous to make product better . Any feedback and problem pls consult us :Felix@bisek.cn or Rex@bisek.cn

Hi Rex,

Thanks for finding this community and joining to give us more information about your board.

I'm interested to know how long this board has been in development for?
Is this the first "generation" or has there been hardware revisions since the first "version"?
How many boards have Bisek actually manufactured/shipped? It seems to be difficult finding reviews.
Do Bisek offer any sort of warranty on electronics etc. and how would this work for international buyers?

Thanks

Don't know if you guys already know, but there's a rebrand out there called the 'Hoverfly'. Some videos here:

https://www.youtube.com/user/dvdmansion/videos

Basically, I'm waiting to hear how ThorbenG gets on then taking action after that! I know they say no more sales to individuals but I've been in contact with Bisek for a few months now, hopefully they'll make some exceptions. If not, they're apparently going to have a European supplier soon.

Sorry I have not had much to add here. I have 3 esk8 decks and prefer evolve GT so do t ride BISEK much except for short haul when light convenient stealth is preferred. Torque and acceleration can't compare to GT belt drive. Not much hills to test grade climbs on. It's a different deck for differ use, and NYC is more stop and go than long flat straightaways. The remote issue persists though not as bad as u itilt, and maybe subsequent revs fixed it,  I have early release deck.

I got my board and have a bit of a review for you all. 

Board was in a Matte finish. Looks great. Now for the meat and potatos

1. The top deck cover plate flexes a lot. Needs more support

2. Top speed is 23kph. That's 1km slower than my benchwheel, which is rated at 1800w with dual motors. I was expecting more

3. Torque is also not as good as the benchwheel

4. Front wheels had no bearing spacers installed. Good thing I checked. Also, one of the bearings was very damaged brand new<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/75ce97ed2606491fd9468f58aeec5e7ecfc6e455.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

5. The antenna sticks out the cable hole next to the motor cable. I guess this was to improve communication. Problem is ot didn't fix the issue. Remote cuts out a lot! It's dangerous. Initial acceleration it throws you forward when it drops connection. When braking it cuts out and let's the board free wheel. Need a fix or I see road rash in my future

6. The board was shipped with the trucks very loose. I had to tighten it up 7 full turns front and back. Very unstable until dialled in. Once it's tight it feels pretty good

7. Added grip tape to the top cover. Turned out alright<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fecdd21465a2327e40fdf182e41972933d3b1725.jpeg" width="690" height="388">

8. Best looking board I have, but I really need a fix for the dropping connectivity. I have a feeling the motor itself could be generating enough emi to cause an issue with the antenna so close to the wheel. I'm going to try to move the antenna to the top of the deck, under some grip tape, near the cover seem. Will update to let you know if it makes any difference

They claim, but it drops out about every 20-30 seconds. The antenna sticks out about 2". Still under the deck and very near the motor. 

I weigh 87kg, 195lb. 22.8kph. That's about 14mph. That's it.

Yep, two different speed modes. Left is 22.8kph and right is snail. Probably around 10kph in the slow mode. 

I have 3 different boards. Yuneec E-GO2, Benchwheel Dual 1800w and now the Bisek 3000w. The Benchwheel is fastest. The Bisek is a close second and the Yuneec is a distant third. 

The Yuneec has the best feel, then the Benchwheel and the Bisek is last. 

The Yuneec has the best remote, easy to use and reliable. The Benchwheel remote is reliable, but not as nice in the hand. The Bisek remote is horribly unreliable. 

All three connect easily when turned on. 

What amazed me about the Bisek is they didn't even put spacers in the front wheels and loaded damaged bearings. I know I shouldn't be amazed by that. I've been to China a bunch of times on business over the past 23 years, but bearings and spacers on a $700 board should be table stakes. 

If Bisek can get there act together on QC, actual performance as stated, controller connectivity, deck top cover flex then they might have a good product to offer. 

I'd like to hear from Rex on these issues as well. A good company will respond back. Sadly when I contacted Enjoy Yin who sold me the board it went completely radio silent.

Timmy, we are glad to hear that you solve it.

The electromagnetic shielding effect of carbon fiber deck is far more stronger than what we expect. We have our factory in rural area, where much less interference here when we test it. 

During the time, we improved the tx/rx by extending the antenna outside the board at the bottom. From August, we improve again. This time we enlarge the power of remote control.

To be frank, Bisek board is the only board all made of carbon fiber. Both the body part and upper deck are made of pure carbon fiber. That makes the board inside just like an airtight box..

Marco, many customers complaints about lead time. So we decide only sell boards in stock. Even you pay now, there will be such a while before we can ship. 

EVOLVE GT is not 100% carbon fiber wrapped I think. Actually even if there is a small hole to leak signal out, that will be much better.

Hi Rex,

I will drill a hole in the side to the control cavity. Hopefully this will resolve most of the issue.

I had a feeling the power of the controller/transceiver was too low as well. Will your new transceiver work with my current board? If so, I'd like to get one.

As for the other issues of not having bearing spacers and damaged bearings, can you please assist and explain to the forum how you plan to resolve these quality issues?

Cheers

Doubtful a hole will be enough..... Enertion had to replace all the tops of the Raptors to fiberglass because of the CF issue...and making the antenna longer is no guarantee that it will catch the signal....unless you can up the power of the signals to overcome the CF

The plan is to drill a hole in the side to run the existing antenna out the side of the board into free air. That way I don't step on it. Having it come out of the hole under the board still meant the entire board was between the antenna and the controller, albeit in free air. 

I'll let everyone know how it goes tomorrow.

Perhaps a manufacturing solution to the antenna issue could be to:
- Use a thin film antenna
- Drill a hole in the top CF cover 
- Put the thin film antenna on the top (out-side) of the CF cover
- Route a connection trough the hole with a connector on the underside of the CF cover (so the antenna lead can be detached)
- Put the final clear coats on the CF top cover thus sealing in and protecting the thin film antenna

The antenna would then be openly exposed above the board and protected.
The CF board and cover would then be shielding the antenna from any radio interference generated by the motors.

What I mean by thin film antenna is something like this, but adapted for the frequency used for this application:

I know from using radio controlled quadcopters that it's important that the orientation of the antenna wire in the remote be the same as the one in the quad. so if the antenna on the board is pointing up then it should be the same in the remote (when the remote is being held in usage position). you'd have to open remote to know the orientation

Like Enertion has experienced sometime you just have to work it out for yourself even though the information is probably out there. I believe I actually thought Id Read about the cf issue and remote signal on here prior to the Raptors going out wth cf lids. Bisek probably didnt get the translation in English to know either. Theres already alot of issue required to make these boards and Im actually not surprised.

How does Evolve get away from no signal issues as their lids are cf and the users dont seem to have signal issues.

I wouldnt get too hyped up about this board. Its my feelng that if this movement and growth in esk8 continues and now the Chinese manufacturers have to mve on from the hoverboard fiasco they'll be looking for the next big thing. What Im saying is theres going to be other makers.

Like Enertion, give them a chance over the next reiterations 2 and 3 and the next ones will be alot better and improved.

These are the first batch of Bisek, so there are gong to be issues. Id wait.

Took the board out for a big 30 minute cruise. Only dropped connection once! And ever so briefly. Very happy with the board now. Really don't care about the antenna sticking out the side. As long as it's functional and protected.

The board is fast

The braking is working well

Handling is good 7 full turns in

Highly recommend grip tape. Matte finish carbon is slicker than gloss.

If only all the idiots with cell phones would stop looking for Pokemon, the skate would go a lot smoother!

For noise it's pretty quiet with no belts.

The Yuneec E-Go controller is much smoother for acceleration and braking

The Benchwheel controller is a little better but harder to hold

The Bisek could be better, but once you're used to it it's not that bad. Just need to be careful you don't push down into reverse.

Battery life and charge time all very good

Wheels get very hot! I live in Malaysia, so to be expected.

Deck shape is a bit odd with the convex lid and then the concave edges. I'm happy it has the concave edges or it wouldn't turn as well.

The handle kicktail can be used to kick turn with not much effort. Nice for tight turns. The E-GO2 deck is even better. 

The board isn't as light as you'd think. 

The Bisek and E-GO2 are both 14.6lb
The Benchwheel is 16.5lb

As far as feel...

The E-GO2 feels like you're on a skateboard. Has massive wheels that can go over everything. 

The Benchwheel sits high, has smaller wheels with wide trucks. It carves like an endless Malibu long board. I feel like I'm on an endless wave with my 9'6"

The Bisek feels like I'm on a 7' thruster. It turns very fast and squerms a bit, but not out of control.

(as I am dealing with them ON A DAILY BASE)
since many years we see them telling us about their products being "the best" and so one as in reality they would sell you cheap crap which can seriously harm you.
no offense @Rex, but this is my experience. I also live in China.

how come, the users here find out connectivity problems???
REALLY???? dude, this just shows me, you give a s*** about if your product works properly or not.
solution: blame it on the rural area, blame it on my grandmother or chinese new year... this list is endless

to all users here: 
a chinese supplier would NEVER tell you the real reason for something. NEVER.

I doubt we should do his development, here in the forum. 
all these points had to be fixed IN THE FACTORY. and not in USA or Europe on the street, loosing connectivity.

do your homework Rex, then sell the boards.
if you were a western supplier and something happens on the street, (accident) you would be sued for all your money, not to mention, somebody got injured really bad or dies.

best boards?

I've used my Bisek board for a month and like 10 uses.   It included some hills up and down.   I did relocate my antenna for better connection which helped a bit.    
Everything was ok with some degradation but while a downhill brake it cut out entirely.    Opened it up and saw some black on part of the board.    Doesn't work anymore.   Im sh*t out of luck getting replacement parts so tomorrow im putting 2 vesc in.    
Anyone know if the hub motors will work on vesc?

will they change their electronic layout in the future?

one can only speculate! ;-)

It seems there is already a new controller being produced.

Felix reply to Tim above: "The new board with sine wave controller integrated in one PCB will be 
production at the end of this month .of cause the cost will be increase. your board is first generation."

There was another reply posted by ThorGro on Reddit: "We are improving our electric parts all the time. From 10th, July, all the skateboards will be equipped with latest 2nd generation motor and controller. The biggest feature is noise control. It's totally silent and mute motor. It will be using all new sin wave controller. And it's 30% more torque."
at the thread: https://m.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/4mohoi/3000w_direct_drive_30km_range_600usd/?sort=top

It will be interesting to see how this turns out.

Hey guys,

I received my board last week, but unfortunately I damaged the control board when I moved the antenna.
It was un-rideable with all the remote cutouts.
Somehow there was a current on the antenna (board turned off) and when it touched the metal bottom plate, there was a spark.

It still rides, but only for a little over a kilometer.

My conclusion after a short period of testing (the second generation, with regenerative breaking, improved torque, all black nun-chuck):

-feels solid
-rear axle with the motors makes up most of the weight
-hills no problem
-smooth and powerful acceleration
-top speed >30 km/h
-really quiet. All you hear are the wheels once above 10 km/h

-remote connectivity issues when no line of sight with the antenna (DANGEROUS!!) - after sticking it out to the side it worked perfectly 
-break kicks in really harshly at high speeds. I was sometimes scared to break.


While they were really quick at replying when I was ordering it, I haven't heard back from them now in a couple of days.
I would wait a little longer to purchase this board - until they sort out the antenna issue and maybe improve the breaking curve. The motors appear to be great and i love the slick design of the carbon deck. Too bad it has the antenna issue which ultimately led to mine being damaged.

@adman could you please provide more information about your mod? Did you modify the original nun-chuck, or did you have to get a new remote to work with your new controller? You may contact me at thorbeng [at] gmail [dot] com

Thanks for the info.

How is the antenna secured to the new controller, soldered or by an antenna connector?
I was thinking of trying putting an antenna like this on top of the cover under the grip tape:

This is a great forum glad I found it. We are also a customer of Bisek re-branded under the name of Hoverfly. We are in Canada named hidefdepot and have been doing business with China under our own brands since 1980 and now carry many different lines including a variety of E-bikes, scooters, hoverboards etc along with this very same longboard that we love. Our experience has been the same as the rest here on the forum that it tends to cut off unless you are a rider with your left foot front first like I am, you then have almost no cut off whatsoever if you keep the controller beside your right pant pocket or anywhere near it. At least that is my experience but it's not a solution. Bisek needs to resolve this matter in a hurry...we have disappointed customers to say the least.

Ok there's been a major issue now that's very concerning to us, we've had 1 board already with major problem..here is the email I got from one of my customers and of course I am issuing him a refund

Hey Chris,   

I got the Hoverfly longboard from you a little over a week ago, and I went to plug it into it's charger that came with it and it just sparked out for a bit in my room. The whole metal cap is off and partially melted, I left it in the board because I don't know if I want to touch it to take it out. The part around it is also scorched by all the sparks. I've attach some photos as well. 

Also, another issue is that the controller still cuts in and out, I'll be riding along for max half a minute before it loses connection. Many times it only keeps connection for a few seconds and other times I have to crouch down and put it next to the wheels for it to connect. It will also occasionally switch to reverse without warning and without pressing the button down to change it. For a board as expensive as it is you should design your own wireless controller or get one that has a long range Bluetooth to connect other controllers or even a phone with a controller app. At least make the reverse a switch like the power is and not just a little button that's either faulty or hyper sensitive. Maybe the issue is the receiver in the board, but something has got to be fixed in the receiver or transmitter, or maybe even both. It literally exploded with sparks when i plugged it in and I'm lucky it was resting on my other longboard or it would've scorched my wall and my carpet. Luckily I backed away in time to not get burnt myself.

I want a refund. This board is unusable now and I don't want to have a board where the controller is weak, barely works, and will sometimes just switch into reverse with no prompting, all happening within a week of having it. It's dangerous for me to be riding just because of that, and if that weren't trouble enough, I don't want a board where I'm literally going to be scared its gonna explode when i try charging it. 

I hope you can address this issue quickly.

Thanks,

Zane

This and some other boards direct from China really show that you are better off buying something proven or of course, given the forum that is, going DIY. You're really taking a risk buying a very new board with not a lot of testing behind it.

Also, what kind of mods are people doing to increase the reliability or performance?  I know adman TimmyT did work on their boards.  I want to do the antenna mod to mine as well since my remote cuts out here and there. I am also interested in the VESC mod that adman did too

Judging from the forum threads and pictures; If the board has a single controller board its a gen 2, if it has two controller boards its a gen 1. I also think the gen 2 boards have rubber "bumpers" on tip and nose, and an all black remote.

Hi everybody,

So time for a quick feedback on Bisek.
 
Last July, before they decided not to sell to individuals, I discussed with Felix (mostly in Chinese thanks to my girlfriend), purchased their board for 610 USD and suggested him to come here to present it to get constructive feedbacks from the community (so that's why we initially had some messages from them).
 
At first, since I was in China this summer and wanted to avoid their 240USD France delivery cost, I asked for a delivery in China where I would have been able to try the board myself and send it to France (for twice less $). The board was supposed to arrive in late august 2016 in China. Few days before the delivery, Felix told us they were facing some problems and needed to delay the delivery to mid-September. I accepted it knowing I would not have been able to check the board in person (I was back to France in September) since Felix promised to have all the problems fixed by delivery and publish a more detailed status here.

Then no much news from their side; We kept asking for updates but had trouble to get answers. At some point, he told us all problems were fixed and the board was ready to be sent. Being prudent, we asked him if he could publish an update on this forum or send us a real life test video to ensure everything was ok.

After several monthsâ€™ wait, we were still ok to wait more to let them fix the main issues and test the board properly. Felix was then impatient and not very cooperative: he told me I could either have the board delivered immediately or just get a refund, and didnâ€™t want to make any updates anymore on this forumâ€¦ He just blamed people here who were, for him, mostly concurrent eskate manufacturers or importers exaggerating the reported issues. He also told their company was not investing in the project anymore and that it was safer for me to ask for a refund because the board was "too fast".
 
I ended up not trusting Bisek anymore as there was no evidence they fixed the raised issues. I also found his attitude kind of rude considering our patience and advices. That is why I asked for a refund which I received 2 days after. 
 
To sum up, I lost my time, my girlfriendâ€™s time as well as Bisekâ€˜s time due to their lack of communication. I am upset by their service and attitude. I think the company could have done something with this product but the lack of transparency have killed their potential.

There is a 14 day returns period :slight_smile:

I noticed that Aquacentrum demo'ed the board with the antenna protruding out of the back https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9OPyefBJhE

Maybe my battery wont explode.

I'm also hoping that the cool uk climate prevents the board from frying.

Yes I have the nerv deck, purchased directly from Bisek 9 months ago. Not riding it now much, winter and I have a few other decks better for that. Short answer is the range is not great, the battery was bugger than I expected when I cracked it open.  Exact specs not come to mind but maybe in my earlier thread. That said the actual range was more like 8 miles or an hour. The speed was only ok, just a touch over 20 mph. As pretty low powered hubs, and software limited I understand to be the case, there is no way it could do 20% grade. Not a lot of torque, even for a hub motor. Issues with remote reception are documented in threads, search Bisek. The deck is nice, very stealth, but really not a great feel if you are a skateboarder as it bows upward convex to accommodate the battery so you ride a stiff bump that has a thin cover which creaks. Definitely nworth seeing and trying first if possible, but typically not possible lol.

hi there Caustin ,well i put in an offer for it and he accepted it ,sham though because that was before i get your message ,
i have written to him saying i want him to assure me that the controller will not have a disconnect issue and the brakes will not have a dangerous not working issue ,that is the main thing i can not have ,,there are many hills here and i dont ever want to lose control of a board at top wack down hill ,,thank you .
how ever i got it for a super price and if the board can be drilled and the antenna be placed in a different location at teh side and it stops the issue i am ok with the 1 hour range and the lower than 20 degree climb 
i have a bench wheel 3600 watt dual motor and it is fab ,but while its charging i ,want another board to use 
i have a "eight ball fastwheel uniwheel"which is to scary for me unless its on total flat ground i go round the basket ball court and that fab cos of the mesh fenc all around ,i simply can not ride it any where else as i am to new on it  ,and a nine bot mini which is so awesome you can go any where on it and the cracks and 2 inch deep  pot holes are not even felt on that .its like a holiday from the rumble of the skate boards wheels lol
i also have a 10 inch smart wheel board that brand new it cos me Â£780 all told with tax shipping import and duty and the price of the board 
its a very different beast .i can't get on it and go yet ,i am trying ,
but it is fab bluetooth music is awesome ,but wish it would not have the awful bing bang boom sound and the stupid Chinese woman shouting ,its so embarrassing  blue tooth is a  pairing ,bluetooth is a connected a suck sess full a lay ,and at top volume too i hate that ,to be honest i have thought about disconnecting the speakers and just using my head phones for music like i do any way on every thing else ,
any way dude 
going back to the nerv ,i probably will pay for it and get it now ,if you say it wont climb hills ,( but how much do you weight ) i will just have to go on the flats then with it ,i am most worried about the brakes not working when the controller is not connected ,does yours disconnect a lot ?
can you please give me as much info about it as poss.
regarding the brake situation 
cheers mate  Konstantin

I feel like this more of an eSk8 addiction forum. 

I started with an $350 Acton Blink Board that was too good of a deal to past on. Found this forum when I decided to move the parts to a longboard for better stability. Then realized I can just build my own because I'm just too large of a fata$$ for that puny motor and battery. Then I got the Boosted 2, and got sucked into the Landwheel and now planning on my next build.

But of course the only dependable board is the DIY!

I've rode and owned a few pre-built.  The only ones I've enjoyed are the Benchweel dual and the Evolve but honestly, I would burn them both and build my own to get the battery, motor torque & speed, deck, etc. that fits me best.

hi well yes i understand that ,i have built some boards in my time 
but they were all a bit slow and heavy & rubbish compared to the things  
i have been buying ready made  this year 
but i am not only interested in skateboards 
i saw this forum and found some interesting conversations 
i really like this forum
maybe i should just close the page and delete the book mark to this forum 
as i am not building skate boards now ,and probably wont be ever again 
should I be banned ?lol ?
not since i have got 2 benchwheel duels and other powered things i use 
frankly if i thought i could build a better board i would ,
but after spending quiet a lot of money on things i did build in the past that were awful.
wish i had spent that money else where

You talk too much,  I think deleting that bookmark is a good idea.

Good stuff, I think you will like your benchwheel. I got a koowheel today and it's awesome fun, I thought I might need to mod the the wifi receiver but everything works like a dream :smiley: snowboarding up hills Haha

It does not look like you are going gery fast... Especially  when you passed the two walkers I got very sceptical... 
Is this the version 3?

This is not a fast board, or one with a lot of torque.  This is not the deck for you if that is a priority

I've bought a magneto, (koowheel)  got it for Â£325 so I thought what the hell,  for that price.

I see many boards like this on Alibaba. Some go to 450$ or so.
So important question that nobody answered: do VESCs fit inside? Also is there space so you can add extra cells to make for a huge battery?

vesc does fit inside.  I peeled some of the heat shrink and fits snug even if you ins
tall some heat sinks.

Which Vesc did you fit in, I was not able to fit dual Ollin or dual Torqueboard DIY VESCs in the place of the buses escs

I think this is the latest incantation, although the deck looks slightly longer:
