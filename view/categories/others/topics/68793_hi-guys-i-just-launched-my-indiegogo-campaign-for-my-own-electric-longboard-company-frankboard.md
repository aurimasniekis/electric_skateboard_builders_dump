Hello Everyone!

I have been working on this for years now, and I have finally launched my indiegogo campaign today for FrankBoard! 
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/frankboard-immense-power-carbon-fiber-boards/x/18514819#/

Carbon fiber longboards, massive LiPos, huge power, midrange price! Check out the video to see where we are now, and what the plans are for the future! 

If you have any questions about the project, ask away!

As far I remember Samsung doesn't make lipos and IP54 is not dust and water resistant

IP54:
* Protected from limited dust ingress
* Protected from water spray from any direction, limited ingress protection

Also the whole campaign looks suspicious not a single real picture apart video. No idea what kind of remote, ESC or other stuff.

If possible I would go into 3ds max or fusion 360 and remake your drawings,   I know you probably dont have actual prototypes but photorealistic renders help a lot.   

also in the vid (which is good) show some specs.   its just a youtube vid at the moment, not a advertisement of the product.

IP54 is for the whole longboard, not the individual LiPo cells though.. Samsung made the cells, I designed the enclosure for them, which is waterproof and dustproof :) 
I have explained in the campaign, the current board, the one we used for the video is a prototype for the Cruiser model, it is not the final deck design, that is why there are no close-up pictures of it. The final version will look like the illustrations on the site, but we need the funding to make those happen, as making carbon fiber molds does not come cheap. All of the other parts are the final on the prototype board as well.
Also, ESC and internal electronics might concern you, and the builder community, but it is not what interests the everyday people, who are the main demographic for buying such an item. It is also bad marketing to reveal all of your parts by name and make, that's basically asking to have your product stolen

if you read to the end of the description, you will see that there are different goals for different amounts of funding. There are 3 models being planned, but depending on funding there might be fewer in the end. You can see how that is lower in the texts

From one guy who has done successful kick starters ill give you some advice.

Dont use what look like bad Photoshop pictures as your product description - again, use realistic renders if you dont have something physical.  Its easy to do and its free.

the other important thing to do is to lie.  just make some prototypes that look like the final thing - it could be made of plywood painted black.  but those prototypes will sell a lot more than the pictures.

also dont use indigogo.  its absolute dogshit.  use kickstarter and dont take peoples money unless its successful

i think the spirit of these "flexble" funding campaigns is the promise the product will be delivered even if it doesn't reach the total funding goals.  but so often than not, they just run with the money.

Kickstarter won't allow you to have a campaign unless you live in the US (needs US bank account) and I live in the EU, so it's simply not an option :/ 
and as I have said, it's not about taking money if it fails, there are different goals for different funding levels. the goal set is just the goal to achieve every aspect of the project, you can see that the first goals for the standart model production are actually a lot lower, and at that point people will get what they payed for, it's not ripping off. I'm not trying to scam anyone.

Dude. kickstarter take NONE of your cash if it isnt successful.  its risk-less which is why it works.

You either succeed at which point you get all the cash minus %5 kickstarter fee, and %5 SWIFT fee.  or you fail and get nothing bus isnt charged anything at all

please don't take criticisms here too harshly.  it's just we've all witnessed numerous campaigns over promising come and go many times over.

and the boards people are building here frankly makes your boards look nothing out of the ordinary.  but for a user in a consumer market, it would probably be impressive.

i'd love to see a source of your samsung lipos, i've never heard of such a thing.

your stated range of 31 miles from a 450Whr pack is rather aggressive, that's about 15Wh a mile.  totally possible but rarely the case.

if your campaign does go off, will you only sell completes or offer parts for the diy market?

Im not going to lie. and I dont like taking a shit on people as we are all here to be civil and help people to grow.  
But what your saying doesn't make much sense - its easy to question your legitimacy at this stage.

It also doesn't help that My KS was half a year ago, and barely anything has changed.

Things are looking janky at the moment.  I heavily suggest taking other peoples advice and restart the campaign with all the advice taken on-board.

I knew I wouldn't be having an easy time when I posted this, but that's part of why I'm here.
I know it's not the best board that is possible to build, but you have to keep in mind reliability, serviceability, mass production capabilities, etc etc etc.. 
There will be some parts for it that will be sold separately as well, belts, wheels, remotes, chargers, bearings...

yup, agreed.  i don't think it's necessary to have the most maxed out boards.  like you said, i'd put reliability, ease of use, aesthetics, etc above outright performance.

good luck with the campaign, doubt you'll get much traction here but blast it on the socials, get it out there.

ok, let's just forget that this is a basic build that is I think below average here..... It just look like diy build that will be (that's the theory) produce in larger quantities. It seems for me that you don't use a carbon fiber deck in your prototype right? You should show a detailed pictures of carbon deck, cells with samsung branding ect. Meanwhile you have really bad renders and one diy board in your clip. Sorry but you need to put a lot more into it to be successful.

So what makes your board different than any other pre made board on the market?
You talk reliability but have no mention of anything that is inside the board, other than a brand of LiPo that apparently doesn't exists . 
If you were using reliable parts then you'd be more than happy to advertise what parts they are.

the current prototype IS carbon fiber, it is 2 layers of 0.5 cm carbon fiber in polystyrene laminated together, and the box is aluminium on this one. the prototype of course won't look as pretty, or as "not DIY" as the final product, mainly because it IS DIY, that is why it's a prototype.

I may sound like a dick now, but your board looks like one of those 500 dollar budget ones with the motor flipped the wrong way around and made in a rush.

if I were you and really wanted to have success I would get some funds together, contact suppliers get something REAL made that shows its true quality read up on DIY and then make an Indiegogo.

You don't go up to a company in runners and a hoodie asking for a job? No, you show yourself from your best side so should this.

what makes it different is the value you're getting. these are huge batteries for this price range, it is made from carbon fiber, which doesn't even exist in this price range currently. The interesting parts (all the electronics except for the ESCs) were designed by me, and will be produced according to my design, so that doesn't have a brand that I could brag about, that is my own. The wheels are also own-brand, the belt is optibelt HP (quality german kevlar reinforced timing belts). The motor has japanese bearings, the chargers are not cheap plastic but aluminium with multiple safety features, and they are all fast-chargers as default.

Ok so how you will transfer that to "mass production"? You should have a least a factory that can make you one or two usually expensive prototypes. Bro I wish you all the best! It's hard to explain on forum everything but what you can see is collective knowledge form people with experience that your campaign is maybe to early.

btw.... if you read forum you know that carbon is not the best material for deck ;)

All of that means literally nothing.

Your acting as if carbon fiber is amazing and wonderful and should be the main selling point, but in reality pure carbon decks are not that great to ride.

Truth is, if you've actually put in the work in to design and make your own internals then you'd be posting them and showing the internals off if it was such high quality. 
Until that is proven I'll be assuming this is another cheap board stuffed with cheap Chinese crap in the attempt at a quick cash grab.

Haha this is one funny campaign, also, is it just me or the guy in the video is not having fun at all riding the board. He also looks like a complete noob and its just annoying how stiff he is and how he's not wearing a helmet. and those abec clones are a freaking joke lol.  

Also the deck is just "2 layers of 0.5cm carbon fiber and blah blah blah, what is 2 layers going to friggin do lol. The whole board looks like someone first DIY build, actually there's a more first DIY builds that look wayyy better than this one, the 1 wheel burnouts on the dirt is just stupid. The batteries are huge, *cough* diyeboards 10s5p cheap n easy. "The wheels are own-brand" They're just some stupid chinese abec clones. And belts aren't a thing to brag about, I can get kevlar belts like anywhere people sell belts. The motor has japanese bearings, like its a thing to brag about and the bearing thing gives you 10% more speed, the fast chargers I can just get some off amazon.

Long story short, the board looks pretty bad, there's really nothing to brag about. It looks like a load of shit. Sorry if you see me as a dickhead but this just seems like bs to me.
