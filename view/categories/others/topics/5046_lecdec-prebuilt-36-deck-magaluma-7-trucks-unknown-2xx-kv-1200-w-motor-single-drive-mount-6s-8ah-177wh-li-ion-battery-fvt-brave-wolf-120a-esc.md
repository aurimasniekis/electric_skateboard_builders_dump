Finally after 2 months and 3 weeks I have the tracking number for the prebuilt electric longboard I bought online. When I decided to buy it, the announced delivery date was 1 month and a few days away but it took another month and 3 weeks to have the longboarg coming my way.

I genuinely though that buying something that would take more than 1 month to be received was a little foolish, even if it was a real car. I see posts in the forum from people waiting for their complete longboards or even for parts and I really understand their pain.

My expectation was that I wouldn't have any delivery problems with a prebuilt but the longboards are made in China (where else) and must be delivered to Europe by boat and that takes time. The company kept me informed by e-mail and some tweets, it even sent me the site to track the boat. The only twist I wasn't expecting was the delivery date being delayed by almost 2 months.

In my [presentation post](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-member-introduce-yourself-here-tell-us-your-plan/216/305) I said that I would learn more about electric longboards, it's components and all the things I would need to maintain my own. Now I feel that I have the necessary knowledge to build an electric longboard myself and if I knew that it would take so long for my prebuilt longboard to arrive I would have built one myself.

Either way, my electric longboard is almost here and I will keep this post updated with some information about my experience with the longboard itself and also about my skate riding learning steps.

You're right, the nominal voltage is a lot lower than we are used to with LiPo or other Li-ion batteries. I only have the information provided on their site:

* Battery Type: Super capacity LiFePO4 Lithium
* Battery Capacity: 8 AH
* Battery Cell Quantity: 6 pcs

I can't wait to see what this board looks like. For several months I have been looking for one of these "Chinese clone boards". The supply had largely dried up and it seemed the sellers (Lecdec, Magneto, MelonBoard, etc.) were all gearing up for their next shipments. Looks like these are finally arriving, albeit a couple months later than expected.

Best I can tell, these new boards are 2nd generation Chinese clones. Some of the upgrades I've seen mentioned are wider (different shaped) deck, smoother acceleration and braking, and slightly higher top speed. These second points suggest an updated ESC- I don't think the motor has changed, so a better controller could achieve these. 

After ordering a Lecdec a couple months ago, I switched the order to MelonBoard because they had a promotion going. The MelonBoard isn't due in the US until mid-July, so I'm a bit behind you with the Lecdec. I'm really curious to see if the new Lecdecs and the new MelonBoards are the same (aside from aesthetics), or if the 2nd generation begins to diverge somewhat.

Please post photos and first impressions when you get your board. I'm dying to see what it looks like.

FINALLY! After 3 months waiting, today my electric longboard was delivered to me. I recall that within this time I investigated, choose the components, bought them online, learned to configure and start flying a quadcopter built from scratch when "drones" were not as common today more than 4 years ago. I believe that I could also have done the same and build an electric longboard from scratch.

Here are some photos:

First impressions:

* It's big
* It's heavy but I never experienced the weight of any other electric longboards
* The deck it's high enough to avoid most obstacles but beware of the motor
* The wheels rotate very freely (except the one attached to the motor)
* The looks and finishing is ok, no visible major defects
* They sent a silicone protection for the remote controller

Next I will finish the charging of the board and remote controller and try it with very care. I don't want to broke a bone on the very first day with my electric longboard. :slight_smile:

Hi, a quick update. I tried to rapidly go to a sport store and buy the helmet, knee, elbow and wrist protections. It was night when I had the gear to test the longboard for the first time but I went anyway. :) I liked a lot and I was very confortable riding the board, those were the first ever meters I did with a longboard.

The only thing that was a little more difficult was starting still, the acceleration of the longboard is to strong to confortably start from a stopped position. I start giving a few pushes with the foot to start moving and only then give a little acceleration. Also I have to better control the throttle because it's to strong but with time I will get there. A very nice first experience. :slight_smile:

Looks good! I don't think I've ever seen a clone board without at least 1 visible defect :joy:. Keep us updated on how it lasts, and especially on the charging process. From what I've seen, the most common sign on failure among Chinese clone boards is that after about a month they won't hold a charge.

Second day riding the electric longboard, first day crashing hard into the ground. I was in the zone, I started carving and controlling the board as I wanted, I made nice 180 degree curves with toes in or out and suddenly when I used the brake I was launched forward. My feet didn't run fast enough and I went to the ground. All with that nice slow motion we all feel when disaster occurs.

The good thing was that I had my helmet, knees, elbows and wrists protections. The right elbow protection strap was almost cut, the left wrist protection got some nasty scratchs, the right hand went to the ground with the remote controller, fortunately I had the wrist protection and the jacket I was wearing has a new hole. Right hip has some bruises, right elbow skin was ripped off and some other minor things all around.

I'm happy, I survived my first skateboard crash. :) Lesson learned, you should not go fast if you don't run fast enough. Also I need more practice with the longboard brake but it's a little difficult since it's too sensitive.

Not related with the accident, since it was before, I'm not sure but seemed that the board turned off. I couldn't hear the ESC fan and the controller battery light indicator of the board battery was not on. Restarted the remote, turned off and on the board an it start working.

Let's see what will happen in the next days, if I'm good enough to ride again and I have no pains.

Hi, here is last night ride:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBRWdUZPNjk

Tips I learned until now to not fall from the board:
* don't test the longboard brakes if you do do be sure you are at a speed you can jump of the board
* don't ride in places were you probably need to use the brakes to avoid obstacles
* braking with your foot probably won't work if you go fast
```

One thing I'm trying to master is the truck setup, loose or not loose. Originally the front truck was loose and the back was very tight. This meant that in short corners the outer back wheel would loose contact to the ground and if it was the one connected to the motor it would spin. Not good.

I made some changes, tight the front a little and loose the back truck a little but I don't have enough experience to correctly evaluate the result when I made about 10 km with this setup but it didn't feel right.

Now I changed again to a little looser in the front and tighter in the back but also tested at home when the back wheels would loose contact do the ground. I loosed the back truck until it was a little more dificult to the whells loose contact.

Let's see what will happen next time I ride the longboard again. I hope to find a nice setup to ride straight, control the board and carve when I'm in the mood.

**Update:** Already tested this new truck setup and I liked it. Good for carving. :slight_smile:

Regarding the longboard, I verified how tight the wheels were and two of them were a little loose. I never checked before but it's something I should have verified when I received the longboard. Good to go now. :slight_smile:

It's time to give an update about my electric longboard experience. I have already ride more than 120 km with it and no problems found so far. The only thing I'm still trying to understand is using the longboard by pushing with my right foot.

When I start pushing either with the longboard on or with it off, after a few meters the ESC makes the starting noise beeps and the board slows down, like the brakes were slightly applied. I don't know if I should continue pushing or not so I never use it like this.

I contacted the vendor support but they weren't very clear if they understood the problem. They said that I can push the board either with it on or off and if I use it on I will charge the battery at the same time I push and coast with it.

As a rule I avoid passing over water but sometimes I cannot help but to go through some of it at slow speed. I hope to avoid any problems related with water coming in the electronics enclosure or wheel bearings.

What I start feeling is that I need bigger wheels. I would like to ride in some other surfaces like the stone sidewalks that are very usual in Portugal. Also sometimes the bike lanes or parks don't have a smooth surface and it's painful for the feet riding there. Maybe I will do an electric longboard specific for this.

Either way I hope you saw my riding videos I posted in the video thread. If you missed them here they are for your enjoyment. :)

2 months later after shipping and around 300km of driving, here is my experience with lecdec board:
- maximum speed 32km/h
- best range 16km
- actual range after 2 months, 10-12km per charge
- charging time: 5-6 hours from empty
- the metal protector from the motor have blunt screws, so no way (yet) to take it off and clean the bearing or motor.
- the remote had an issue with the on/off and calibrate buttons. It has a design flaw and over time 
- their customer service is basically inexistent - it took almost two weeks to respond and failed to fix or replace the remote. 
unsolder from the main board and failed to respond. I had to take off an unused button from the back of the board and solder in the place of the on/off button. 

Being my first board, and like @sismeiro said, I did order it because they promised fast shipping in 2 weeks in my case. And it took 5.

Hi @ciocan, good to know about your experience with the LecDec electric longboard. Thank you for sharing.

I should also post some information about the range and speeds one of this days. My experience about the range is more or less what you said. I think I usually get about 15 km of range on average, maybe more since I don't go that fast.

It's a pity that the customer support didn't work for you and you had to take care of the problem yourself. That's not what we expect as a paying costumer.  

No mechanical or electrical problems yet (knock on wood) and enjoying every minute while riding it. :grin:

Hi all, I'm still riding my electric longboard and enjoying the last days of summer. I don't know what will happen during the next months but I expect to continue riding my longboard even when the temperature is lower.

A different subject now. I didn't imagined the quantity of iron dust that was around in the ground until I looked at my longboard motor. Since it's black it's easy to see metalic dust strips all over it according to the magnets direction.

Hi, today I went riding my electric longboard in Campo Grande park in Lisbon. While trying a new bike lane I hit a Eucaliptus seed whith the left front wheel. I was very luck since it did't stop the longboard immediatly and I had the chance to run out the momentum but the longboard was left behind.

Here are the photos I took with the skid mark in the ground. The seed is too big for the wheel to go over it. This is why I'm seriously thinking about making a new electric longboard from scratch with big wheels, the ones I really like are the MBS All-Terrain Longboard Wheels  but a little expensive.

Hey all you lecdec users 👍, I'm having a problem with my motor the brakes have become sort of useless it barely slows me down when I'm going downhill I noticed this because my friend has one too and I always catch up to him way too fast going downhill and I leave him behind while holding down completely on the brakes, I've also had the issue of the cheap controller breaking because of too much force on the A or B button, sometimes my controller just stops working when I hold on the B button for too long, I really want to put a VESC but don't really have the money for it, I really can't trust this board yet I'm scared that it'll send me flying while I'm not expecting it. 😵

Hi, why do you hold the B button for breaking? I never saw any information in the manual regarding the B button being a brake button.

I have read and heard in some YouTube videos people talking about the use of the B button for braking in other chinese clones but I don't think it works. I never tried the B button for breaking so I don't even know if it really works or not, I just follow the manual information.

Beware that going downhill can get you into trouble if the battery is full. The energy has to go somewhere and if the battery is full something can burn.

I use the B button to slow down before pulling back on the brakes it helps the cog last longer B is sort of a sort of a soft brake I use it when I'm skating too fast to pull on the break. When I do pull on the break the belt overlaps the wheel cog, I'm gonna have to get a new one I'm gonna get the one made in Aluminum so that it lasts longer and I'll just have to change the belt when it's worn out

Ok but are you sure it breaks? When I want to reduce my speed without applying the break I just slowly let the controller stick go to the middle. Isn't this what you are doing when pressing the B and it simply slows down?

Sorry about asking you this but I never found that information in the manual about the B button and everybody complains that the B button doesn't break enough so I think it realy doesn't brake at all.

I use the B button to slow me down faster it charges the the battery too, because when I go downhill the battery indicator flashes green and orange when ive just recently turned  orange. The B button is not a full brake but sort of a soft break before pulling on the full break.

Hi, today I had the opportunity to ride my LecDec. I tested the B button and I can now confirm that something happens when I press it. It seems to slightly reduce the speed and the motor makes the same sound that is usual when I use the brake.

Regarding your problem, I don't have any clue about it to help you but I think you shouldn't use your longboard when going downhill and apply the motor brake. In the Magneto page explicity says that you should "Never ride downhill exceeding the boards top speed, this can cause a malfunction in the equipment."

Even more alerts about downhill riding:

"1.) Skating downhill. 
Be careful riding your Magneto Electric Longboard down steep hills with the power on, the Magneto is ok with the occasional hill, but braking downhill continuously eventually wears the motor out and you will end up with a dead board, a new motor solves this problem. When riding downhill switch the power off  and skate the Magneto like a regular longboard, perhaps invest in some long boarding gloves for these parts of your journeys."

Thank you for your photos, they will help me when I remove the wheels from my longboard. I have about 200 km done in my LecDec. How about you? Your wheels are a lot worse than mine.

I think I need to change all bearings, not just clean them. One of the front wheels make a different noise when I turn from one side to the other. Something is not ok to make that noise.

Olá, bem-vindo ao fórum. :slight_smile:

Eu sei que já dei 24 km/h mas era a descer. Também já devo ter dado mais de 20 km/h em plano mas nunca tive que activar nenhum modo. Aliás, desconheço qualquer forma de activar ou desactivar modos na minha LecDec nem vi qualquer referência a isso no manual.

Do que já vi em videos e nos sites onde se vendem clones destas longboards é que os dois modos de velocidade referem-se ao modo normal com o stick do acelerador e ao modo cruise control em que se fixa a velocidade pressionando no stick. Ainda foi só recentemente que descobri que pressionando o botão B faz um "soft brake".

Costumo dar uma voltas com a minha LecDec no passeio marítimo de Algés, é uma questão de combinarmos e encontramo-nos lá para trocar umas impressões sobre as nossas máquinas. :slight_smile:

_Hello, welcome to the forum._ :slight_smile:

_From what I've seen in videos and on websites where they sell these clones longboards is that the two speed modes refer to the normal mode with the throttle stick and the cruise control mode in which fixed the rate by pushing the stick.

_I often take a lap with my LecDec on the promenade of Algés, it is a matter of combining and meet you there to exchange some impressions of our machines._ :slight_smile:

Olá!! Boa, então 20 km/h é mesmo a velocidade de ponta dele a direito. É sempre fixe conversar com alguém e tirar dúvidas. É que comprei isto em segunda mão... Porém nos sites das "marcas" dizem 20 milhas, 30 km/h... Eu tenho andado por Lisboa, podemos combinar pelo passeio marítimo um dia destes e trocarmos umas impressões. ;) Era fixe. Estou alto fã disto!!

Não foi bem isso que eu quis dizer, eu é que não passo dos 20 km/h a andar normalmente. Eu não gosto de andar muito depressa, tenho um certo receio de ir parar ao chão. :slight_smile:

Um fim de semana destes combinamos e encontramo-nos lá em Algés, é um dos locais porreiros aqui à volta de Lisboa para andar descansado e com muito espaço.

Last Tuesday was the day to do some maintenance to the electric longboard. For some time that I noticed that the wheel pulley has many dents made by small rocks passing by it against the ground. The problem is that this dents make some plastic go towards the belt and if they touch it they will damage the belt so it was time to remove the dents.

Other thing was the wheel connected to the motor seems a little more worn and even had a small bit of glass in it. So it was time to change it with the other back wheel. The bearings probably needed to be changed too but it will be done another time when I have new ones. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/3/9333eebc197e7afc5e4478a83aa5cde2d2d784f8.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/b/8b905cfb57c411efe52910f259867a8328cda7fc.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I took some measurements of the motor mount to eventually make a new one.  If I change the wheel size and use a bigger wheel pulley I will need the capability to adjust the belt tension by moving the motor and the current motor mount does not have that possibility. This is part if my future plans when I start making some changes to the longboard.

The longboard was also cleaned, it had lots of dust in the wheels and some mud remains from the times that I went through wet ground. I always reduce my speed below walking speed to avoid spieling water all around the board and also avoid damaging the bearings.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/5/059d6a790bdec11b7a1aebf42e5c88b1b72bc035.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/6/6617aa5e93a5f1e538bf31260db42b5c38cd3ecb.jpg" width="690" height="388">

After changing the back wheels, one problem I had was knowing how many turns I would need to give to the nut of the motor wheel. Since it's connected to the motor I could not tell when I had given more turns than necessary and the first time I did give to many turns. I removed the nut and to know when it was enough I put a paper between the washer and the nut, when the paper started moving with the nut and was stuck between them it was time to stop.

This is it for now, hope you enjoyed the description and the photos. Let's see if I also upload some videos for may YouTube channel soon.

The led strips are connected to the white controlling box which is powered using the battery 🔋 I used a 24v to 12v transformer that cost 5$ on Amazon and connected that to the battery I'll send a picture of the circuit board as soon as I can

Hi, many months have passed and no news about me riding the LecDec in this thread. I have been riding from time to time but with the cold and rain I don't fancy going out.

This is a video from the last time I went riding since I couldn't resist the opportunity of riding in open streets here in Lisbon. It was the inauguration of the new street configuration, they are trying to make them more eco friendly .

I hope you enjoy the video.

I think it's time to make an update about my LecDec electric longboard now that I have it for more than a year. With roughly 450 kms it still has all original components and never broke down, not even the belt.

I don't know if I was lucky and if there are other Chinese electric longboard clones out there with the same kms and without problems. It still charges well and I can do about 17 kms if I don't carve to hard. :)

Do we have any other Chinese longboard clone owners in this forum that want to share some information about the status of their electric longboards after being used for some time?

You are so lucky 🍀! My board has died so many times already it's like Frankenstein now so many different parts trying to keep it alive it has about 510 km and a already changed :
The belt (13€)
The ESC (65€)
The On/Off switch x5 (it melts every time I go up a slight hill) (35€)
Now I'm having another problem with the ESC I'm gonna have to change it soon or probably put a VESC or get a new board 😭

Hi, how about your battery? Is still going strong? I need a new battery for my LecDec longboard and I want to know where I can find one. Many thanks if someone can provide some hint.
