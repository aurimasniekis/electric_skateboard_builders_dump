I would recommend you to avoid Diyeboards, a lot of guys here have had problems with them, try to search for them on the search function and see all the bad reviews they have

If you want them, buy them from here:
https://www.ownboard.net/collections/parts-accessories-for-electric-skateboard/products/free-ship-ownboard-105-66mm-all-terrain-rubber-motor-kit
Or
https://www.skullboardvip.com/collections/accessories/products/skullboard-airless-wheels?variant=16754616533049
Make sure to buy their esc like in these kits (or use a dual vesc) otherwise the hubmotors won't work properly

Take into consideration that they are heavy and wobbly.

I would recommend you to search a comparison on hub motors, and look at this topic [Is Diy right for you? ](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/is-diy-esk8-right-for-you/84563)
There you'll see a lot of good info on trusted vendors, and as I saw when looking for my parts, it's best to go with external motors, that way you don't loose 1 motor and wheel, and you just replace the motor, and from the other side, you can use better trucks.
