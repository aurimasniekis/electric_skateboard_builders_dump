Brilliant, purposeful, go-anywhere at anytime design by @trampa ships this Summer.

http://www.trampaboards.com/trampas-orrsum-longboard-with-65-inch-urban-treads-tyres-on-hypa-or-superstar-wheels-p-25616.html

Straight-up superior to Evolve.  The Bamboo GT's price point is $1650 shipped (Carbon is $2250 if memory serves).

Trampa Orrsum should be the perfect platform for builders to offer superior Orrsum-based ESK8s for /far/ less than the Evolve GT Carbon price.

@Nowind is an E-TOXX Stealth Drive possible with this config?  Happy to be your first customer, too.

It will come with a nice drive train. We just need to  ad that to the Website. A lot of thought went in that drive train system, allowing to use PU wheels, Gummies and pneumatics. Keep an eye on the website in the next weeks.

## \#9 Posted by: lock Posted at: 2018-04-19T11:28:18.090Z Reads: 425

To fill the gap in the deck when the baseplate is mounted under the deck? For when it‚Äôs running smaller wheels? Just guessing here.

A few **real** pictures would be helpful. Also wouldn‚Äôt mind knowing what it weighs; same material, slightly lighter trucks, but I‚Äôm guessing about the same as a carver?

You can, and you will have cable channels as a benefit on top of that.
Drop through, Drop in and below deck is possible. Total difference in deck position: +- 30mm.
When riding pneumatics / Gummies  you want to lower your deck and get a nice carve feeling out of your trucks. The feeling is similar to a 30mm drop down deck.

Shred Lights will go straigt onto the baseplate when mounted drop through.

Good idea with the cable channels.
But the protrusion should then be on the adapter - not the baseplate. I want to be able to choose how thick the baseplate should be and not be forced to use the adapter on a standard deck.

Our Trucks will feature a pivot cup that sits a lot higher up the baseplate to give the board the beautiful carving experience it has. You can use the truck just like any other LB Tuck, using the cable routing adaptor provided. It is simply more versatile and brings more options on the table...

Feel free mount the hanger onto a Caliber II style Baseplate if that is what you want. 
That will place the hanger in the exact same location as using the adaptor. But you won't have any cable slots....

Cuz that's where your pivot cup sits. Way up above the deck. You can't place a pivot cup in an adaptor.
Other boards need a drop down to achieve the same ride feeling.

Not for sale at this stage. We will start selling the complete board first. We need all incoming parts to serve our customers wanting complete boards. Once more stock arrives we will probably sell the complete truck as a component. Milled from a solid billet, they will not be budget trucks.

Board looks great, but if it's excluding a battery it's a fair bit more expensive than say a Boosted or Evolve. Not knocking it, just thought to check. A GTX is A$1800, this is A$2150 without a battery. I understand the difference in specs, but not everyone might.

You seam to compare twin Orrsum to GTX. The single is stronger than the GTX already. It outperforms any boosted, evolve etc. 
The twin drive outputs 5KW! 

The overall quality level is also far better. Every part is CNCed from a solid billet of aircraft alloy, deck with life time warranty, more wheel options than any other boad out there and space for a crazy battery.
Do the math, and you will see that the Orrsum is far better value.

When you say "complete" you mean the complete/kit *electric* longboards? I note the non-electric versions are no longer on your site.

It's an interesting niche you're going for with this. On one hand it'd be great to order everything and have it show up ready to be assembled instead of waiting months for parts from several different vendors. But on the other side one fo the great things about DIY is you get to pick and choose what components you want. Also, I don't mind soldering stuff... if this kit cuts all that out, well where's the fun in that üòÇ.

Good to see the end caps for the battery tray üëç, but those trucks need to be anodized black üòâ

I'm not sure you'll pick up much of the prebuilt market with this. Seems you'd still need quite the technical background to assemble one of these including sourcing a battery pack/bms/power switch. Not to mention drilling 'n stuff to mount the enclosure. Always happy to be proven wrong.

Also, while we're talking about new trampa stuff. What's a "Trampa VESC Connect"? Bluetooth module?

My point exactly. I don't necessarily want a belt driven set up. A big draw is the challenge of designing something of my own (or outsourcing it haha). I want it __my__ way.

[/quote]

When you hold these beauties in your hand you will quickly realize that anodizing such parts black would be a shame. The CNCed aircraft alloy looks fabulous, contrasting the deck in a beautiful way.
Trampa has always been about quality and exposing the materials we work with. 
This is why we ad the CNC work to our MTB Trucks after surface treatment. It's a pain in the bum to do that, since the parts have to travel from the CNC factory to the surface treatment factory and back. And they need to handle them with extra care after the coating has been applied. But it's worth the extra work.

We will do the drillage and drop the inserts into the deck. Those boards come ready to fit the battery. Stil there is plenty of room for tweaks and mods. 

What's a Trampa VESC-Connect? Good question! But we will see what it is very soon. 
Benjamin and I think it's orrsum and there is a very high chance that you will share our opinion.

Hey @trampa I like the new Orrsum deck but I also like building. The trucks that go on this complete are rocking my boat but I could not decipher from the trucks purchase page if Trampa provide one or a pair for ¬£100? 

The word ‚Äòtrucks‚Äô is used a few times but nowhere does it say only a single truck will be supplied.

If a pair then I‚Äôm a buyer for these along with the Orrsum dual mounts(no guesswork there üëç)

Ps. I‚Äôll also need mudpuggers for the HolyPro, hard to get traction on sand with these alpha tires

I like your deck @trampa because resembles mine with cut-outs and all (made me think I'm not alone with my choices) also like the wider trucks, which along with Orrsum flat deck defies conventional wisdom and gets lots of flak from all four points of the esk8 universe. Also thought about putting gummies to this super light LDP, but I realized will receive more criticism from naysayers and doomsday seers... guess I was not too far from reality with my wild dream.

When you hold the deck (made out of Baltic Birch wood) in your hands, feels as stiff as an iron rail. Is super slim, like a razor, and super light, just 1.6 kgs (3,2 pounds). It comes in two version, soft and firm flexes. Mine is firm but off course it flexes a little bit with your weight, about 1 inch. It was designed primarily as a LDP deck (Long Distant Push, or Long Distance Pump, which ever the acronym); the decks side cuts are a result of the designer wish to help the Longboarder to push with both legs straight below the shoulders comfortably.

They first cut the baltic birch long strips, the cores are then vertically laminated, glued together (this gives the sandwich a lot of strenght); then carving out lots of wood and reinforcing the plank with 22 carbon fiber layers. The carbon fiber along the wood qualities produce a very strong and stiff deck. The resulting cruciform shape gives additional robustness.

Despite being flat as the City Hall lobby it feel super grippy. Because is so long you feel secure positioned 'inside' and not over the decks edge. I'm also thinking on designing a carbon footstop which will be a beauty, though. Will be smthng like this....

The Carver can definitely turn harder, but the Orrsum is also pretty agile. On the Carver we refer the battery on top of the board, while the Orrsum has the battery below the deck. The Orrsum is stiffer, the carver can be more flexy, depending on Ply rating. Both boards are a lot of fun!

I‚Äôm interested in trying it out and see if it can be a viable alternative to grip tape. Though it doesn‚Äôt seem to be long enough for a longboard from the pictures. More like a pad ?

These are pads, to small for a complete deck. They are quite thick and weight is high. The advantage is better grip in wet conditions, especially if sand is involved. The sand makes regular grip tape slippery + it peals off after a while. These stick to the deck like hell.

No BMS.... No space for it, no need for it.
Such a pack hardly drifts and balancing it while charging is more than enough cell care. 
12S5P 20700: No need to charge it beyond 90% or discharge below 20% of its capacity.

Frank (@trampa) , tell me....can I cut that hump over the trucks plate? So annoying. Messes with my intention to use those trucks on my build (Top Mount) ...don't tell me to use that drop-thru basplate adaptor which adds even more height!

If you use the adaptor, the truck will have the same hight as a standard skate truck (e.g. Caliber). Same steering geometry, same position of pivot cup, same steering angle, same position of Kingpin. The base on these simply sits lower and the adaptor brings the base back to regular hight.

If you want to mount them drop through, you can.
This will drop your deck super low, about 15mm lower than usual drop through.
If you mount them with the hump sitting inside the deck (base below deck), you will have the same effect like mounting a regular truck drop through, but nothing will stand prone of the top surface of the board, which is an advantage.

You can't cut the hump, it houses the pivot cut.

Thank for the explanation. A few other things: how much is the usable axle lenght? Could you take the axle? If is interchangable, are there any more axle lenghts we could use?

Hi just wondering if the 12 fifty trucks are the same profile as the caliber ll trucks? I need to save some $$$ and I have caliber motor mounts laying around already.

Do other caliber 2 motor mounts fit these trucks?

Not the same profile. You would need to file.
Motors to the back also require longer mounts.

And what about TB218? Do they have the same profile? I also want to use some mounts designed for Caliber or TB218. 

Thanks.
