Nice deck and truck! I like it. Do you sell the deck and trucks separately?

Well some YouTubers say because one truck is 0 degree and the other one has a degree that at higher speeds the board experiences wobbles

@skateborad is is resolved?

Would a meepo Sanyo battery be strong enough to power that kit?

they use a 14ah sanyo pack (10s5p?) that isn't for sale individually.
If you use an 8ah pack, the range would be pretty bad

Alan, yupe. That's true. Since previous rear truck is not available to make turning, so all speed woblling come to front truck, so when the speed is high, the wobling is out of control. So later we accept their suggestion and test a lot, and fix the problem. Hope you can also share this video to more Electric board lover.

LOL, We also have no idea about it. While if you r a geek, and got Meepo battery in your hand, then you can take a set, and take a try. While usually, we don't suggest that, cuz it might hurt the ESC cuz of the some compotablity issue.

Hey, Bro what do you mean by selling the deck and truck seperately ? You just wanna some part, instead of whole set,right ? You can visit Wowgoboard, and talk with our sale staff directly about your specific requriement. Besides, pls kindly share this video to your SNS groups, thank you so much

Hi! I meant that since this one is DIY forum people like to build their board themselves. Therefore could be that someone wants to buy either the deck or the truck alone to pair them with other products.

@skateborad
Will you sell the AT battery separately? (14ah)
I am scared that the original wowgo 2s battery will not be enough power if I buy the AT conversion kit

[/quote]

Hi Murdomeek,

If you wanna use the AT board battery to get longer range. You should buy the AT battery case together, cuz the size of AT board battery is too big, and can not put it into the 2S board battery case; Besides, you also need to drill the fasten holes on the deck as per the AT board battery case. So if you really need. You can email to : wowgoeboard@gmail.com . Then let's talk more details.

Are you going to sell the AT Remote seperately? If i use it with my Wowgo 2s, what advantages does the display offer me. Remote and Board battery + current speed. Correct?

What's the weight of the AT kit, without the escape and the remote ? (So only 2 motors, 2 trucks, 2 AT wheels) ?
And what's the kv ?
