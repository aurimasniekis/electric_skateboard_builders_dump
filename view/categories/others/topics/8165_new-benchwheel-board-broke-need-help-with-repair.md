Hi, like it said in the title, I purchased a new benchwheel board, and one motor died on my very first ride. I was riding it on the slower mode, and never pushed the throttle beyond 1/3. I felt the motor give out while I was cruising on flat ground, and it looked like it was spinning at about half the speed of the other one at the time. I thought perhaps the batteries were giving out, so I brought it home and charged it. The next day, the faulty motor would not start at all. When I try to use the board, the motor just kind of turns slightly back and forth, not sure how to really describe it, it's like a slight vibration to and fro, or sputtering? It feels stiffer compared to the other motor when I try to turn it by hand. I've been riding the board single motor with the belt and wires from the faulty motor removed, but I can't climb some of the hills on my daily commute any more. Contacted benchwheel, and they say I need to pay for shipping back for repairs. Is there any chance I could repair this myself? Please help! Would really appreciate it.

Sounds like your motor cables have disconnected. I'd rip it apart and have a look at them. The motor is stuttering right?

Hi, I managed to disassemble most of it, and I can't find any wires that might have a problem. The faulty motor is still stiff even though it's not connected to the batteries and stuff though. I can't figure out how to remove the motor itself from the enclosure though.

If the motor is still stiff with its wires disconnected, then there is either a an internal short in the motor wiring or the bearings in the motor have failed. 
My guess would be the shorted wiring inside the motor. 
Where did you buy it?
If possible, return it
They have too many quality issues.

Darn. I was really enjoying the feeling of an electric board. Is there anything better in the price range of this? I got it for like 550usd minus shipping. Or is it possible to build something with equal performance in that price range?

The Yuneec ego2 at $699 is a quality budget e-board
Top speed 12-13mph
Range up to 18 miles
Or you can build your own but that tends to get expensive and requires some tools and equipment along with soldering and mechanical skills

I considered that option before I got the benchwheel, I didn't go for it because I was afraid it might not be able to climb the hills on my daily commute. Even while both motors were operating, the benchwheel still struggled with one or two, and refused to climb one at all. I weigh 63kg. If I were to save up for a proper board, what would you recommend? I don't really mind top speed, too many cars where I live, and surfaces are not the flattest for me to go too fast and feel entirely comfortable. I can live with not being able to climb that last hill, would be nice though. But the only thing I've heard about that might be able to conquer it so far is the enertion raptor, but I'll probably have to save for half a year or so with how much I'm getting paid-all the stuff I have to pay for. =(

I have an EGO and you weigh about as much as I do. I can climb 10% grades without any issues. Steeper if I have a running start. It's hard to beat for $700.

If you're handy, you can always scavenge parts and used them to build another. Although starting a DIY build from scratch might be easier. 

What sort of grades are you trying to climb?

Really sorry about what happend to you man. What you need to do now is open a dispute right away. Aliexpress normally offers good buyer protection. Explain what happened, and add video footage of the broken motor. Demand a refund. If you don't want to send the board back due to high shipping costs you can at least get a partial compensation.

Thanks man. But I kinda want to give their sales rep the heads up. While their product was sub par, their customer service has been surprisingly good. The problem is that I have to pay for shipping back to them for repairs, and judging from this board, it looks like I'm going to be doing that often. =(

Get an app with a level and place it on your board. The degrees will give you a rough estimate. It's difficult to measure by a pic.

Dont trust their friendly facade. What does it help if you end up with no money and a broken board? It's obvious, that they shipped a faulty product and judging by the videos on youtube, you are not the first. They must be held responsible. Demand compensation through Aliexpress. That is your right as a customer.

Yes, they are like the tortoise. Slow and steady but they will finish the race. 
It's a good first eboard. It's what I started with and it seemed pretty fast to me at first. LoL. 
I did out grow it pretty fast but mostly because of the hills in my neighborhood. 
I almost bought a Benchwheel for backup but they are plagued with problems.
The new egos have better deck but they look more like a toy with the new color scheme.

LMine is a bit safer since I dropped to 10s and Vescs. 
With the 12s Lipo, TB Esc's and 230kv motors. It was almost too much power. I really had to be careful with the trigger.
Like a dual trigger. 
Pull slow to go
Pull fast to eject

EGO definitely won't do 18%-30% grades. 10% would be about the max. 

Your best bet if you can't get your board repaired/replaced would be a dual drive DIY build.

i just got a benchwheel a couple weeks ago.  no issues for me yet.

i'm almost certain you can just replace the motor since it's mounted with like three screws.

then the cables are just friction type so you can unplug them.

just make sure it's not the electronics, maybe you can check for voltages, make sure the problem is with the motor and on the electronics?

Check out this guy who took a Chinese clone and upgraded to VESC and the end result seems like respectable board.

I can remove the motors from the mounts. It's the black enclosure around the motor that I can't remove. There's a tiny hole near the axle, and I can't seem to get either Allen keys or screwdrivers to turn anything inside, though I do feel something inside catching slightly. Any recommendations for alternative motors that would work with the board as is?

Yes the shroud is removeable (if you are reffering to what covers the band).

don't use a battery terminal puller, the flanges are aluminum and bend very easily. I got mine off with a little heat and a flat head screwdriver in between the mount and pulley. You probably don't even need the heat.

I managed to yank it off. Just keep pulling and maybe heating the pulley up with a lighter or something. That's how I managed it. You need to remove the circlip at the end first though.

I guess the pulley is glued with the strongest loctite. I do this to my pulleys and i have no issues. Also pulleys with a keyway are no problem on a round shaft. And when i want to get it off then i heat it with the soldering gin und spin it instead of pulling.
At the beginning i also thought that it only would work with non keyway pulleys so i gave it a try. But it works awesome.

Mine had a circlip and was really tough to pull out too. But I still can't open the motor covers. Can't find an Allen key or screwdriver that will turn it. And can't really tell which I need to be honest. The hole is too tiny for me to see into.

wow bad bad luck with your motor ,I am 94kg  and i have no troubles going up any hill and there are some steep ones i have to pass i recon eassy 30 degreesat teh steepest but althought it goes slow towards the top it get there ,unless its on low battery then it does not i have to get off it and just let it ride its self up there with out me on it i run along i don' mind this cos it goes so far i really hammer it every day sometime i charge it and fully use it 3 times an day ,i always keep mine super clean ,if its bone dry out side i don't need to clean it every time but if it damp out there if there is any sign of splatter under the board i take off the drive wheels and wash and dry the belt and i use a tooth brush in the groves of the belt  ,,once you get muddy grim in the groves the belt or the gear  loses it control ,if your riding it and the belt ever slips you can also do a tric i do i carry a blush brush and i have got a small jar with talkum power in it ,i stop and turn it upside down and just wipe the belts groves with a paper towel & apply some power to the groves of the belt with the blush brush  ,it just if i have happened to go through a slushy muddy puddle ,,and i have bought the very very best ceramic bearings too ,i have to say it made a considerable difference changing the bearings to ABEC 11 ,BUT THE CERAMIC bearings WILL IMPROVE THINGS EVEN MORE ,TRUST ME back to your issue 
if i was you i would buy the motor kit from bench wheel and change the motor .,i mean sending it to china  and at its huge weight is gonna cost 
to much .
i do know they sell the motor kits for it on there website ,
i think i even saw some bench wheel motors on ebay .co .uk a few days ago 
they were about Â£200 i think ,i can't really remember thou don't quote me 
i promise you one thing bench wheel board are superb once you have it going again you be happy you got one ,
sounds to me like the hall sensor in the motor is the fault ither that or theres a mechanical issue 
any way good luck buddy hope that you get you bench whell going soon and what was it a c or a b shape one you got ?
i got a c ,cos i was toying with buying and fitting off road all terain wheel to it ,but i can not find them ! maybe some one can help me with that .
cheers guys

Hi, they actually sent me a replacement. Although it did take a long time, and I had to raise a dispute before it happened. I do agree it was a pretty good board. However, the entire board died recently. I've almost finished building something new. I did honestly really like the benchwheel while it was working. But it's been so unreliable that I just would not buy another. It's like gambling whether I get a working product or not with the money.

Hello Everyone,

I also need help with a Benchwheel repair. Please can someone tell me how to fix my Benchwheel? I snapped a black wire?

Story: I was replacing battery when I mistakenly broke the thin black wire that comes from "black heat shrink packet" to the end of board cap? The wire starts as a white think wire, but goes into the "black heat shrink packet" and then is attached to the cap at the end of the board. However, I pulled the wire by mistake and it broke from within the "Black heat shrink packet" and now I don't know what to do?

Questions:
1. What is the wire for? What is the wire for? Do I need it? Is it a ground? It was attached to the black cap?
2. How do I fix it?
3. Should I cut open the black wrapping and solder back?

Thanks for suggesting best way to attach black wire back into the black wrapping?

Hey guys, sorry if this isn't the place for this, I'm a first time poster. I'm new to this site, and am a terrible mechanic. However, I'm desperate to get my Benchwheel working again. Yesterday I got caught riding in the rain. The power button would flash red before shutting off. I could also hear what sounded like popping and wheezing/hissing coming from somewhere underneath the rear trucks if I put my ear right up to it. Now it won't turn on at all, nor is it making that noise.

I'm desperate for a solution, should I start a new thread for this? Can anyone in NYC fix it for me?
