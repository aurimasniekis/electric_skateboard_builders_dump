The hubs are a little ridiculous

The Sound of Silence - X2!!

Here are audio samples from the X2, so unprocessed.
Distance between micro - X2
1 sequences = 3-4 meters
2 sequences = 80 cm from above
3 sequences = 10 - 20 cm behind the micro

Haha... the guy in the Video ... it's me going uphill!!!
ja this was fun and i love still love to do it!!
No the x2 don't go 40 km/h uphill... in this video maybe is was 30 km/h...

but we have now the ONAN X2 4WD... this can do 40 km/h uphill on this truck!!

4.000 W (4 times 1.000 w)
12.500 torque - the x2 4wd can pull easy a car
min. range 20 km
topspeed 40 km/h - and we can push it even more...

here i make a little video in guangzhou - were is ONAN from.
