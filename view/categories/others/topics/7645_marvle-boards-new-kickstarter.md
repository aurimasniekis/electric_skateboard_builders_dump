Hmm.. it's a DIY board, Tacon motors and the GT2B. I'm sure there is a VESC inside also. Would really like to see some specs from the battery. I'm sure the 'creator' is on this forum, because the 'prototype' was a first time build.

I had a small discussion with the ceo. He claims that each board will be guaranteed with 25 mile range.  I told him that's pretty unlikely given his 12s1p or 6s2p (or similar)  setup.

Not enough detail to see if realistically achievable.

25+ miles w/ me on it vs one of you who weigh half as much as me...  Love the idea, but seems DIY and i could do the same for less - on a board of my choosing.

Now their stretch goal of 100k - android and IOS control of board - that sounds interesting!

25 mile range but requires more than one charge

maybe they meant 25 mile warranty?

They are running 12s (It showed in the bullet points). Which means the battery must be around 3-4p.

I also found a grammatical error, it may be small but I look for these things.
"because there no need"
This tells me they don't check over their work, so good luck to all that splurge and most likely never get a board.

I would really like to have the CEO on here, maybe it's @Rasha ?? 

Something else that tells me the CEO is on here is the are using a GT2B housing, and the only place to find that is on here or ES.

Also not sure if the whole battery shipping thing can be pulled off. We all know what happened with the SPACE CELL. and if the battery gets 25 miles it has to be the same size or bigger.

Haha this is great, he said they don't want to say how they achieve 25 mile range, but it is due to extreme motor efficiency and a great BMS. It's a total motor which you can't buy, and probably a Best techno BMS. Groundbreaking.

This kid is all talk. I really hope no one spends money on this.

Not only that, I mean im new-"ish". Made 1 sluggish build that sucked. Then gained a lot of experience, will do my second and even I feel this is just sad, bad and full of poop.

But what triggers me more is the arrogance to go forth and actually trying to get money with such a bad buisness plan, with typos, no presenation of the Team, their skill (?). Semms like he was high, sat down in words for 10 minutes, had somone edit a Video and borrowed somones DYI build from 2 years ago and was like:" Fuq ye dude, lets kickstart this".

More than half of the E-sk8 community does Better. (well, I can name the best of the best, but there is a lot of people to think of, so I prefer to left it blank).. It is not even a complete product.

Edit: complete**** It is not look like a finish product. There is a lot of moulding to be done, to get a quality product.

And @longhairedboy  makes f*ing perfect boxes. And @psychotiller.. Not to mention many others.

can these/this person even come up with a better name? These darn con artists are ruining the internet! Just by the name "MARVLE" is ludicrous! They already have MARBLE which I think is another lame name. And all those other generic made in China OEM ones are even worse like MELON or whatever. These kickstarters are almost as silly as those Alibaba/AliExpress names they come outta nowhere. "As long as we have ABCs, we guud and we sale so mo' ching ching!" I've never backed anything from KS and probably never will. Unless I truly know that very person is an innovator of something that is truly fascinating.

This is just fantastic, he said he is a senior in high school before and this is his Kickstarter bio

holly shit, I didn't even see that one. This guy is the biggest fake to try to kickstart a board so far.

No offense to the young ones on on this forum, but there's a certain amount of experience you need in life to be able to make a product that's ready for kickstarter. You think you have a good design, but how much knowledge does he really have on the physics of electricity?  At that age, it's normal to think you know everything. But when the real world hits you, either in college or for some, not until after college, you realize how much you still have to learn.

He thinks he can one up everyone, but like @link5505 said on reddit, we are not stupid. You just can't fit a 25 mile range battery in that tiny enclosure.

On top of that, the only thing in those pictures that looks nice clean is the board, which he did not have a hand in making, lol.

Whether this guy is inexperienced or not, He is trying to make his job out of something he is passionate about and loves. I know many of you might have cleaner builds and a lot more knowledge but you all sure do sound a bit jealous. If his concept really is bad, and if his product isn't capable doing everything he claims it can, then be sure that this product won't break through. isn't that what Kickstarter is for ?

Our current situation, Lets say 70% of the e-board market is owned by "Boosted board" (No offence to them, they have a great product). Slow but steady other brands are starting to pop-up, Enertion's raptor, Evolve's GT,...  and people are noticing. If i were to ask people 10 years ago what the best smartphone brand was, they'd all say Apple. Now, 10 years later people would start having tremendous discussions about it. I just hope our E-boards will get there someday. 

All I can say to this guy, I wish you the best of luck and hope all your claims are true.

With 12 cells (like he claims in the campain) this is close to physically impossible with the current technology. You'd need an amp limit of like 2A :confused: --> He is lying and tricking people - that is not okay and there is no way we can let the backers know. On Kickstarter all you need is a claim - no proof is necessary so [quote="ikjahaa, post:96, topic:7645, full:true"]If his concept really is bad, and if his product isn't capable doing everything he claims it can, then be sure that this product won't break through. isn't that what Kickstarter is for ?

Don't get me wrong here, I don't like seeing people getting scammed but they weren't force to back it. Personally I would never back a project above a certain cost, certainly not if the prototype looked so bad. But these 8 backers, who knows, they might be super rich. :smile:

I was going to say something similar. Something like, he is trying to start a business, and it takes a tremendous amount of work. But then I realized the only thing he did was make a really crappy prototype, start a kickstarter, make outrageous claims that he probably cant back, and make a 3d render of a 'finished' product that is easily achievable to actually make. 

I all ways support small business, because I know how much work it really takes. I just wish he stopped lying and was a litter further in the process for Kickstarter.

I have a feeling everyone who bought one so far (or almost everyone) knows him in real life, which is why they sold. My frustration with this guy (and all those crappy re-branded Chinese boards) will make it harder to kickstart an electric skateboard. I know there's some of you out there who have thought about it before (me included). And attempts like this ruin peoples faith in ones ability to make boards, and pushes people who are disappointed to main stream companies, leaving us little guys struggling to gain foot in the market. I think we can all agree that baised on these designs, he has no business kickstarting a board. He doesn't have any real education to brag about, nothing to leave us feeling this guy knows what he's doing.

I don't think hes had enough of it. He clearly doesn't understand electronics what so ever. Any cell we use on an electric skateboard will have a nominal voltage of 3.7v, 4.2v at full charge. So when he says a 12s1p battery is 44.4v (when empty, btw, 50.4v when fully charged), but a 12s battery is not at 44.4v?!?!? So what he's saying, is his battery is not a 12s battery. That or he's using some other cells, like AA batteries which have lower voltages. Either way, his argument here makes no sense and shows a lack of understanding of what s and p mean in a battery. There's no difference in voltage between a 12s and a 12s1p... But he seems to think there is.

He says 12s boards are crazy fast, 35 mph+. That statement right there is so ignorant. Not every 12s board can do 35 mph. In fact, I would be willing to bet more can't than can. That is because we won't hit 35 mph very often, so we would run super inefficiently to have super high top speeds if we never get to them. It's all in the gearing and kv of the motor. He's using a high kv motor, so his impression is that his speeds would be 35 mph. But if he used a different gearing ratio and/or motor with lower kv, he could run 12s with lower top speeds. It seems clear from his argument that he doesn't understand these basic principles. On top of that, the 35 mph he's saying, he would never reach since it is his no load speed. With only one motor, standard 3:1 gearing, and 200kv motor, he would max out around 20 mph in the real world, because that one little motor has a lot of weight to move. I know that because that was almost the same setup as my first build. 

Overall, he seems arrogant and uneducated. It seems like this was his first build, and he decided to jump the gun and sell it. He said the people he's had use it have reach 25 miles. Was that with 15 miles down hill, and 10 flat? I can tell you, you won't make it half of my five mile route to school which is loaded with mid grade hills on this board. Heck, I still doubt the evolve gt can do 25 miles.

The other part he might just be missing, is he seems like he's on the smaller side (from the video). @hummie is 50 pounds lighter than me. If he rides his board, his motors don't heat up that bad. If I ride his board, I heat those babies up like a fire place. It also kills range, as the reason they get hotter is because I need more amps, which means the battery will drain quicker. Has he tested range with a 200 pound rider? I doubt it, I doubt he's thought about a lot of these variables.

A 12s battery is not empty at 44.4v, it's just at nominal voltage. A completely discharged 12s pack would have 30v, but you'd want to discharge to about 37 for longevity.

The closer to nominal voltage (or about 40-50% on a meter) the better it is for the cell. This includes for charging. If you **really** wanted your cells to last, you'd charge to 80% and discharge to 20%, but most people won't do this because they want good range on their pack. You can keep a pack lasting for pretty long while getting good range by discharging to 3.2-3.3v. Personally, I have my cut off at 3.2v.

For reference Samsung tests their cells from 4.2v to 2.5v over 250 cycles. It's all about finding a balance between amp hours and longevity of cycle life.

You can check this discharge curve too

Take a look at the 10-15A discharge curve. Once you use about 1.25 amp hour (50%) of the 2.5amp hours in a 18650 cell you have about 3.4v on the cell. However, due to voltage sag this is probably closer to 3.6v. Since the graph is non-linear the cells deplete rapid when voltage falls even lower, so it wouldn't read 50% on a voltmeter.

That said, 3.6 is about 50% of the capacity of the battery, but won't necessarily read 50% on a voltmeter. You should still have a bit of charge after nominal voltage though, more than 5%.

If you read his Kickstarter carefully, he never says he's using a 12s battery. He just says that it has 12 Lithium ion cells.  He makes the following claims:

20 mph top speed 
2200w motor 
12 cell li-ion battery with BMS
25+ miles range 
$699 price 

And honestly, that probably can be done... If you were to use the biggest li-ion cells available and configure them 6s2p. There are a couple oddball 32650 cells out of China that have 6000 mAh capacity at 10 C rating. String em together at 6s2p and you have a 275 WH battery that can discharge 20A continuous. Limit the amp draw with the BMS, pair it with that tacon 245kv motor with proper gearing and you got your 25 miles range / ~20 mph top speed in ideal conditions. The raw materials wouldn't be that expensive either, you could use a cheap 6s car esc with a little programming. 

The problem is that it won't have any climbing power and the cells will have a short life if you are constantly pulling the max rated discharge. It'll fail with bigger riders and hills. The ESC won't allow for modifications. Kinda like the Yuneec & benchwheel boards, it'll work only in certain conditions and I doubt you'll get decent customer support from this high school kid in Miami.

I think you mean 10A rating not 10C rating. 10C would be 60amp discharge * 2P for 120A discharge. even with 275 watt hours there's no way it'll make it 25 miles, not even close.

Yeah 10A continuous discharge per cell, my mistake. 

I'm sure that there are lighter riders who can take a single-drive, 275Wh board 25 miles on flat land if they are cruising at a constant speed where rpms are near peak efficiency. Of course, most people would pull more amps just to get up to that speed. 

Real world range would obviously be lower.

I must've missed where he guaranteed 25+ miles range with every board. Thought he just said he was "thinking about guaranteeing it" on reddit. 

But yeah, the business model is pretty half-baked, using off-the-shelf parts and trying to win on price while pretending it  will perform like a $1,500 board or bring anything new to the table. The Chinese knockoff brands have the market for cheap, underpowered copycat boards locked down pretty well, you're not gonna beat them at their own game. If there is any innovation or real engineering that went into this board, I would love to hear it.

[/quote]

 I wonder what cells he's using. He doesn't have much space. rc esc's tend to have more bulge more than a vesc for example, which would make it even harder to fit 32650's. If he was doing 18650s, in a 6s2p, most you could get would be 3000 mAh, which in a 6s2p, would be 6000 mAh. I used to get about 10 miles with a 8000 mAh battery and similar setup. With 18650's, he would only get 8 miles, 10 if the gearing and environment is right.
