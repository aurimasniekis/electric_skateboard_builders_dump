Just found this and thought you all would just get blown away at what this company JED is making. An all wheel system with sensored motors that work like true AWD and the trucks sense the weight distribution of the rider to assist with traction control from what it looks like. The motors are connected to the wheels with a geared setup with no belts, like woa. This thing looks sick

Don't spur gears need to be lubricated for high RPMs and loads?

Looks very DIY still. Also for the weight sensing thing, wouldn't it be easier to use a gyroscope for adjusting the power curve?

Definitely DIY, pretty impressive to say the least unless this is a comonn build and some of the expert DIYers  have done this before???? I've been reading a ton of the builds here and hadn't seen somethin like this created yet.  He's possible using a gyroscope for balanced traction or some other form of pressure sensors that output depending on the weight put on the board to trucks. Probably why there is a fairly thick spacer between the trucks and board.

A hall sensor on each side of the deck next to the motors could serve as a distance sensor for truck movement, which would give four signals for throttle scaling. Ir lasors get dirty and weight sensors degrade and fail with vibration. Slim sensors under the grip wont get reliable data because of foot movement.
I dont know about the telemetry maths, but getting the physical data reliably for traction control is an interesting challenge. Nice find.

Actually.... thinking deeper, the movement from running over a rock could throw the system out of sync and jump the throttle a few percent on each bump with hall sensors. Setting up the delay and sensitivity would be tough.
What about a wireless proximity sensor worn on the belt to get center of gravity location reletave to the xy center of the board?

Didn't you guys listen, the spur etc. is going to be metal in final production, not polyester/nylon as it is on their prototypes.
Looks good but just seems a bit overkill to me. I like the use of the Tesla batteries though, I might think about that for my board.

I don't see why you would use direct drive gears instead of just hub motors... Hubs don't require gears or a motor mount, which is yet another cost on an already expensive board (due to 4wd).

Also, that app seems dangerous. I've thought of similar ideas of how I can incorporate gps into my app, but telling people to take road that they don't know the quality of is dangerous IMO. That's how you end up hitting a pothole on a road you don't know while looking at your phone to navigate. Honestly, you should get familiar with the roads on your riding routes, and if you need to navigate, pull over and check the maps.

I can't speak of everywhere, but 40% of the roads here if SF or maybe more are not ridable on a street electric skateboard, due to the extremely poor quality (or if you can, you must ride at slow speeds and be light footed over the potholes, and deal with the extra wear and tear your putting your board through).

Would it be possible to create some editable wikipedia style overlay onto Google maps that could rate and color code road quality for ESk8ing? So when we pull up a map route, we could select the car, bike, bus, walking or **ESk8** option and select the fastest route or the smoothest route. And when we find good or bad roads, we can update the maps. That would be cool.

That would be crazy cool. I think this is only really practical for major cities though. There's too many little cities with little to no riders to make it practical for everywhere. Even like my neighborhood in sf, has very little riders. But I will see if this is possible. I have some friends that work at google down in san jose, and they come to my school very frequently. Maybe I could convince them to adopt this :P

Well, a downside of the Jed Board is that it only goes 20 km/h or 12mph.
Edit: 12mph is the slowest mode. You can change modes and traction changes as well because of the weight sensors around the trucks. Pretty sick.

Ya if this shit is real, its seriously pretty cool man. It seems like you can choose to use the pressure sensors actually from what he said in the video but i have to listen again carefully.

Hey guys thought i'd chime in. Jeremy here from Jed Boards. The board you guys may have seen on a recent YouTube video was our alpha board that I just travelled from Singapore to Sydney with, so it's been a little beaten up. The wheels have done around 50-60km on them, they've been swapped a few times.

In regards to the gears, we aren't using spur gears, they're very quiet custom machined gears made from carbon steel with an induction treatment and coating for lubrication.

We are very much ramping up to production and this will begin in January. The board has a number of sensors, including gyro and force sensors to measure weight to ensure starts and general power is handled as optimum as possible.

By default it ships limited to 20km/hr, but this is changeable within our app and within the remote itself.

We are indeed a real company based in Singapore, i'm an Aussie though :) Happy to answer any questions anyone has!

Additionally in regards to the navigation, we're grabbing GIS data and other bits to give you the best way to skateboard to your destination. Where possible we always prefer bike lanes in major cities, but sometimes footpath is the only option. The navigation element isn't on the phone itself, there is a remote with haptic feedback that doesn't require you to physically look at it to know when the next direction instruction is up and coming. The remote control has a small screen in it and its designed so that we minimise any distractions.

The quality of the road/pavement is obviously a factor that needs to be considered, but something we are working on. That said it's not designed to be a replacement for common sense and being aware of your surroundings, it's a tool to assist.

The reasoning is because we want to give people a great experience without degrading the urethane of the wheel. Hub motors are great, but they sacrifice a lot of the wheel for the convenience of having the motor inside the wheel. Our direct drive system uses standard Orangatang Kegel's, without the hassles of belts that can and do break.

Not an early bird price :) The pricing is our retail pricing and in USD. $1199 for the dual drive setup and $1599 for the all wheel drive setup. Right now we're taking pre-orders with a $299 deposit which is fully refundable if you decide not to go ahead. 3 weeks before we start production on your board we'll take the balance. You get a referral code after buying where if you refer a friend and they buy you get $100 off your board. The more you refer the most discount.

its super flexy AND super stiff. Magic! World of issues there given the lengths of those boxes, but good thing they're strapped on so that you don't end up with boxes tearing at the bolt holes. 

Those are definitely sensored Maytechs. 

The nav is a cool idea. When all else fails, give it good software. 

Aww, no sammy's? Tesla Pannys work though for sure.

Well its flexible enough with a core of solid vertical laminated bamboo. It's got cross grain fibreglass to add stiffness and a fairly agressive concave running across the board. It gives it a decent amount of stiffness without a lot of wobble at high speeds. Probably not the best wording in my previous post.

Our casing is made of glass filled nylon and flexes with the board as do the battery packs and other components. The PCBs are mounted on dampeners that move with the flex of the deck. They're also sealed from water and dust, not water proof completely but its water resistant. You can safely ride through puddles (as we have numerous times on purpose) and the wet, not something we recommend from a safety perspective.

We're not a big fan of the Samsung batteries, the NCR18650B we've managed to do a lot of harm to (on purpose) without killing them.

The motors are indeed Maytech (made to our spec). It's the software that really does most of the work to bring all the various sensors together and give a smooth ride.

We believe our pricing is right on the money based on what you're getting compared to other offerings in the market. Our team has over 20 years of experience with bringing products to market, working with some of the biggest brands like Apple and Tesla.

The referral is a way to help incentivise people to refer their friends and family, and our way of saying thanks for doing so. If you refer enough people then you don't pay anything for your board, it's a win win situation for both parties.

Word of mouth is something we absolutely believe in. Moreso we stand by our products and all our products we sell come with a 2 year warranty. Our battery pack is designed to retain 80% charge after 7 years riding it every single day and charging it.

Our mission is very simple - to bring the best products to market that offer amazing features that don't require you to have to think too much about. Things like traction control to ensure safety at all times. Sensors to deliver power efficiently. Battery management systems that can change the configuration of the battery packs on the fly for improved range.

You're missing the point. As a company you can't just give money away, you have to account for that and I suspect you're not selling these boards as lost leads. 
Therefore, you've factored a $100 referral fee into your pricing, so when you pay out a referral fee you still make money. OK not as much money as a non referral, but you take a $100 hit.

What I'm suggesting is just do away with the referral fee altogether, to your potential punters you're $100 cheaper and much more appealing as the product will be more affordable. Otherwise you're shooting yourself in the foot.

Noone cares about a referral scheme (in my opinion), they'd much prefer to not have to shell out so much cash in the first place to get the product they want.

So you're saying that the board.. the total voltage of the board.. is running at 16 volts? What's the KV on those sensored Maytechs? It was hard to get a sense of scale from the video, are those 50mm or 63mm cans? I'm familiar with Maytech's catalog, I'm actually working with them right now to cover my ass on an upcoming shortage of my favorite motors that i have forseen in my crystal ball. 

I don't think there is anyone here running below 22v. Most of us are running at 36v or higher. My packs are 44v at 10ah (440 watt hours) Even at all wheel drive 16v will feel anemic in the hands of anyone who's ridden any esk8 at all.  Who is your target market? 

I find the geared drive system very intriguing. I could see selling multiple sets of gears with various ratios as upgrades or mods.

Each dual motor setup has its own pack. Power delivery is controlled using our various sensors. We can achieve speeds of over 30km/hr. The packs may be small compared to what a lot of DIY builds use but we have Panasonic batteries that can take a lot of abuse and have time and time again showed us how stable and powerful they are. Our packs are designed that they can feed each other as and when required. While riding we can switch off motors and coast them and divert power to other motors to ensure efficient power delivery all the time. 

We aren't trying to make the board go 40km/hr because that doesn't make any sense from a safety perspective. We are offering perfect power delivery based on the riders weight at all times.

you might be on the wrong forum with that kind of talk. lol

Seriously though, a lot of us have boards that are capable of speeds of 50kph or higher, and a few of us are regularly hitting 56+ kph on flats. 

but if you are targeting newcomers, it makes more sense, which is why i was asking what market you are targeting; who are you trying to sell these to exactly. You're going to have a buttload of competition in the noob consumer space, even with the software wizardry. It really is fascinating to me what you are doing with the software and gear drives and flexy deck and flexy box materials. 

just don't ever use blutooth for throttle control. Even at those lower speeds, BT is terribly unreliable for that kind of thing. ITs perfect for data though. I heard you guys mention that you have multiple radios and that the phone actually connects to the remote, which is cool, but throttle control via BT is going to get somebody hurt, so hopefully the BT is limited to things like readouts and data streams.

i'm not giving him a hard time, just trying to get past his marketing firewall and find out some real info. 

In my opinion i think commercial esk8 companies SHOULD come here. Probably before they go anywhere else. We're on the bleeding fucking edge here, and i don't think a lot of people realize just how much influence this community has on the market. 

I want to see more companies pass through here and take notes from the people who build for passion and not just for profit. We'll end up with better, safer boards on the street so that we can do what we do best: build faster, more extreme boards than they do and watch them come back and have another look before they move on to further iterations. 

So with all of that said, he's more than welcome here and thank you for bringing in a new member.

That's great, and I really respect that aspect of electric skateboarding, but our target is to offer something that offers power (read torque) over top speed. We believe our top speed is fast enough for everyday use.

We're not here to argue with anyone by all means. We absolutely respect the DIY builders out there and value the community and the feedback.

Agreed, some comparisons would be nice.  Each have their ups and downs. My biggest concern with this drivetrain is gear wear. With belts, power is distributed to more teeth because obviously the belt wraps around. With this direct gear set up, how long can we expect these gears to last?

The drivetrain is being engineered to last 2 years at minimum. The thick urethane of the Kegel wheels will give you a good amount of wear before the wheels need changing. 

Our drive train is very quiet and we will be posting more videos up on KS and our YouTube channel. 

We've been working on this for over a year and it's been something that's been in the works for a number of years as a concept here. 

The gears are not just off the shelf gears, everything has been designed for the purpose of the Jed Board taking into account forces being applied and dynamic loading during acceleration and braking. 

With every day use we expect 2 years from the drivetrain and at least 5 years from our battery pack charging every single day.

Personally, for me, it seems your USP is your drive-train, but other than a brief overview on the kickstarter page you don't go in to it enough. I understand you want to protect your IP but people need to know why it's better than anything else.

For me the video is a bit underwhelming, not enough jazz or real world use demonstration. ie. What are the regular problems from most electric skateboards on the market, how does Jedboard overcome that... etc.

Apart from wanting to build my own board anyway, I don't feel excited about the product or feel it's a must-have for me to part with my hard-earned cash, maybe a new video is in order?

You could do with some renders of the final product also because (and we know they're prototypes), the images in the video and in the gallery make it look more like a DIY project than a polished end product like the boosted board for example. Like, I note you've got the wires going from one enclosure to the other, in the final product, will they be in-bedded in the board or on show like that?

On the note of the drive-train, I can't tell from the photo you have in the gallery, or the still from video, but I'd hope that those teeth on the pinion and sprocket are quite deep, like a few mm at least, because honestly, I think you're going to get some kind of travel/movement between the two and then you'll run in to trouble like teeth not aligning and cog slippage which would lead to teeth stripping.

But, we could all be wrong I guess, I wish you luck.

Appreciate the feedback. The video we're working on cleaning up a little, it was re recorded this afternoon :slight_smile:

The pinion and gears use a helical setup and the final production pieces were working on at the moment have fairly tight tolerances for alignment that we are working towards. The gears will have a bearing to ensure they pull in and stay aligned without slippage. 

We're working closely with caliber on the tolerances for mounting to their trucks. The original plan was to make our own trucks which we've designed to be machined from 7075 billet. Unfortunately at this stage it's a little too costly for us to go that route.

If you rotate the motor pulley/cog wheel such that the fat bit is facing outwards then there is less leverage on the motor bearings which in turn relates into a longer lifetime of these components.

It's actually really quite fast. It's over 8 metres per second. 

Safety is a huge factor we have to take into consideration when making a product like this. Our traction control system ensures adequate grip to the road at all times. 

All Jed Boards come with a helmet bundled. We take safety extremely serious.

Just a quick update in case anyone is interested. We've just started machining our pre production gears, i'll be posting some videos up in the next week. From here we'll start testing them in the field and in the lab, our aim is to build a gear drive that lasts for at least 2 years with daily riding.

YES! dude I have been thinking about it for a long time, the google-maps addon would be the best, there would be like different choices for 1WD, 2WD and 4WD, bumps n stuff, green-yello-red road quality, traffic, and a simple app where you'd just tap some buttons to 'record' the type of road you're riding at the moment with GPS tracking, or so, just what came into my head. It would track you all along and mark it, roughly spoken. Would be cool if some IT student would bother to make it as a grad project

The gears are the hardest to make and require a lot of calculations in order to ensure they mesh and the forces being applied when braking don't shred them. We've tested a number of different materials over the last 6 months and have settled on something that has so far proven its worth.

Here's what it sounds like with 3D printed polyester gears. Mind you these aren't perfectly aligned, etc. Once we mount up the new gears and mounts, everything will be aligned and the noise will be reduced by about 80-90%, so you should only hear road noise plus the motors.

Here they are in metal. The plastic cover is over the gears, but there's a few small tweaks needed to get it humming along right. Much work to go yet to refine them, but thought for anyone interested here's how they sound right now. Lots of power on just a single motor.

The noise is mostly because of some friction against the plastic casing we printed a while back for the gear covers. We'll be making a more refined version of this shortly.

We've made a number of refinements to our gearing and drive systems to help with noise and alignment. We've re-cut all our gears with a new gear cutter and have changed our gearing slightly, which has allowed us to reach up to 35km/hr top speed. With some pack reconfiguration our 780g battery pack now contains over 14AH of power, with the ability to burst up to 80A per pack.

More testing today. Today we've put a set of gears on without any treatment or lubrication to stress test the conditions we can push the Jed Drive to before we start to see issues.

The noise is a little loud given the lack of lubrication and coating on the gears.

We've also made some tweaks to our braking curve that adjusts based on how fast or slow you're travelling. At the end of the video below we go from 20km/hr down to 0 in a matter of seconds, but the force isn't such that you feel like you're going to be thrown off the board.

You should calculate the Wh with 3.6V instead of 4.2V a cell. So 200 wh is more realistic.
Don't get me wrong, I think the direct gears are really cool. But you should try to keep your marketing a bit realistic. 
How many watts is the maximum power output of the entire system?

And in theory the battery isn't allowed on a airplane. So you simply have been lucky. So when you are lucky enough to take it with you on the first flight then that doesn't mean that that also works on your flight back.

And here we go. Finally with proper lubricant. Motors are making pretty much all the noise now, but what a major difference that makes. We're using a nano tech grease that bonds directly to the gears and becomes part of the material. Last a long time and corrosion resistant, etc.

Indeed we have had a number of delays, I wish making products that are safe and reliable were easier. The team has been in China since March and we're still here and not leaving until boards are shipped. We're very active on Instagram and Facebook :slight_smile:

I weigh around 90kg. Our test riders weigh anywhere from 65-120kg. We’ve averaged around 25-28km for most riders and with our lighter riders a few have achieved 30-32km range.

I’m guessing to keep them air travel friendly ? Apperabtky frim findings from both Arc and Jed, the efficiency of Gear Drives are really good.

A Mellow is even 7s only 2p. It´s alot about efficiency and in which you like your board to be seated in.

Also about the range you get: 
I weight about 90kg too, about 100 with everything in the backpack, helmet and stuff. I usually get about 30-40km range going about 20-25km/h through city grounds with hills and everything with my 432 Wh 10s4p 30q pack according to @Ackmaniac app.

I did a first trip with my girlfriend 2 days ago. She´s a beginner but is doing good with her new board. We did a trip near the river, only flat land and only with 10 km/h average. My app is showing now 81km range left with the current average consumption of under 5Wh/km.

So you get the range depending on how you ride ;)

Also my Mountainboard is an 8s system and blows away most other 12s systems here.

I still have my doubts about that range but they are using a gear pulley system and no belts (“direct” drive) and run 80mm wheels last I checked. To be able to do 18.6 miles (like @captainjez quotes) on a 160Wh battery it means it’s around 8.6Wh/mile. On my diy running 15/38t with belts on big 107mm wheels I get 13Wh/mile (and that’s not by going slow). Getting that down to 8.6Wh is doable, specially when you build your own motors and find the best efficiency for your drive train. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that “direct” drives have way more free roll and during a normal ride that also increases range.

I wish we had a standardised way of testing range, some commercial boards do market themselves with ridiculous range that is never achieved in real life.

That being said, I am excited to see a new high end production board on the market.

helical directdrive even, super freerolling, asked if they sold the pulleys separate for sience, a year back. They refused. Sadface. It would sell like butter on these forums. Maybe as spare part in the future? @captainjez

That's not what direct drive means.  In-wheel hub motors are radial direct drive and Carvon-style motors are axial direct drive.  A quick search uncovers a lot...

Gear reduction systems are exactly that - gear drives or cog drives or whatever, but they certainly aren't direct drive.

Derek had some good info about efficiency of hub motors vs direct. He found the carbon v3s to be the most efficient but his numbers for those where not far behind what I could get with hummies hubs, which is slightly worse than the direct drive had seen. The numbers where around 10 wh per mile with Carvons vs 12wh per mile with the direct drive vs 14wh per mile with hummie hubs. The reality is that I could get it down to 10wh, but performance would suck. At 14wh, performance is still ehh. And at 40wh per mile, you have ludicrous mode.

At the end of the day, it comes down to drive train and motor losses, but most importantly, the number of watts your running at. A geared system will always perform better than a direct drive or hub motor system at the same wattage. But you get a hub or direct drive motor large enough and you get good efficiency still. So at that point, it becomes personal prefernce.

The tests up to now are not the most scientific either. I think the reason Derek had better range with the carbon vs gear drive is because of the motor plus gear combo was for high speed (70 mph) rather than lower speed. Would love to get builders together at some point and build scientific tests So we can all learn more about how to build efficient systems using the drive train of our choir, because I think it can be done with all drive trains.
