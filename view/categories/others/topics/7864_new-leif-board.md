I'm not sure if I just missed this randomly, but apparently, Leif Tech is making a new board? I just randomly googled it bc of something @Mikeomania12 said.

Honestly, it's not as practical for transport, so you have to want it a lot to buy it, and it's really expensive. But idk it sounds like a blast.

I've always wanted to try a Lief/Freebord. They look like so much fun. 

Does anyone know if their bindings are a new, hopefully lighter design than the Freebord ones?

This design doesn't look that hard to build - the only trick would be getting 50A through the rotary tables.  Ideas?

a couple of 5065's would tuck right into the drive pods.

I've got to chime in on this thread :slight_smile: I received my Leif last week and I've been riding it daily in Southern California. It took some getting used to compared to a traditional electric skate/longboard, but man.... once it clicks, you're going to be hooked!!  For me, Freebording looks like amazing fun, but scary as hell to learn.  The Leif has successfully bridged that gap for the rider who wants that snowboarding experience but is too intimidated to charge their first Freebord hill :fearful: The confidence you get when you  start slow and work your way up to speed made a huge difference when learning to ride. Props to what they have created over at LeifTech!

Also to clear things up the Leiftech board is released and you can buy it currently, as far as a new board they aren't a company like boosted that has a V1 or a V2 board and makes you buy a brand new product like Apple, everything is totally modular and as they change and improve pieces you can easily have those pieces changed out and upgraded. To ArmandR who thinks its not practical in the streets of New York, ITS MADE IN NEW YORK CITY. You obviously have things backwards, a leiftech takes less space to turn, I cut fast corners with my friends where the boosted and evolve cannot turn in time or have to take much wider and more dangerous turns than I do. I would also like to add that I commute with mine all the time and its is MUCH more practical than a boosted board that has awful range and an interchangeable battery that requires an allen wrench to change on the go. You get 13 miles range in the middle of a cold day in January on it with their new batteries and the battery is interchangeable, takes me 30 seconds to swap it out and snap the battery cover back in place. Is it as fast off the line as a boosted, no but that's because it uses AC motors unlike most companies that use DC, that means its easier to control your acceleration versus other boards that feel like they're gonna tear out from under you if you don't slowly progress in your speed. The motors are dual 1300 watt motors which means I climb hills better than a boosted V2+.The deck is high quality made of Maple and fiber glass and was designed by NeverSummer which is a high end deck manufacturer. The design is as I said before patented so this isn't something as easy to build as a normal electric skateboard, a lot of ingenuity went into this product. If freebording excites you this is a great first step towards learning how to do it without bombing down a steep hill to learn how. Lastly without a doubt it is THE most unique board on the market, nothing else compares. If you want to practice your snowboarding skills this is a great way to do so, trust me when I go out and ride with the local NYC E-Skate group I feel like after a long day of snowboarding after doing 6-7 hours on it, its a full body workout and is great exercise. The customer service is above and beyond awesome to boot. KlethBane if you are near NYC or anyone else is I can connect you with the owners or you are welcome to join on an e-skate outing to try my LEIF out as I have a close relationship with the owner/co-owner and they often come out riding in the city with us. I've even been one of their main beta testers since I live nearby here in NYC and everytime they have something new and improved they call me in to try it out. Getting my new battery cover and the new beta remote this week to test, super psyched! Lastly its one of the safest board on the market as well and the company pays exponentially less insurance because of this. Every other company has high insurance costs because they rely on electronic braking that can be spotty at times and not respond to you during dire moments, the leif is the only board on the market that you can manually stop without relying on an electronic brake (which it has built in as well).

No other company can sell it, but an individual can build it so long as he or she doesn't sell it.

I understand your desire to support this new company, but those (few) of us who do this for the thrill of DIY rather than the thrill of riding should be able to take any design we want and improve it.  This is actually advantageous to the company because it points out weaknesses in their design they might otherwise never have seen.

In the old days almost all farming equipment was modified by the farmers, and I still modify probably 20% of the products I buy to better fit my needs.  My latest target for modification, believe it or not, is the stupid noisy range hood.

I don't understand how it's still a freeboard. LIEF made their own freebord. The trucks and wheels aren't freebord.

At least they don't look like it anymore.

Or are you saying LIEF patented the design?

I suspect this is how a dodgem/bumper car would also be attached. Not sure this would be original enough to be patented?

I can't imagine they were able to patent power transfer rings - there's one in every steering wheel of every car on the road.

They use (or used) them for horns on car steering wheels.  Also, high-end winches use them to transfer power and data lines down to submersible vehicles and/or devices.  They are used everywhere, have been for decades.

Theyre called slip rings and are used in everything you can think of that has an electrical signal and rotates. 
Gimbals, radars, gun turrets, tracking antennas, steering wheels, dc motors, helicopter swash plates, etc.

What happens if you hit a ''gap'' with your LEIF board while going sideways? Do you get a ''nasty'' bump or you just roll over that smoothly?

The ride experience does look very ''buttery'' / nice in comparison how ''regular'' boards tend to go / roll on the road :slight_smile:


---
@PXSS @DougM
  
Im also not sure how that patent is working for these rings.. anyone should be able to make them and use them for their own benefit.. to be patented they must have some sort of special feature in them I think which would be or should be hard to replicate.. 

One more version I got is that they somehow ''patented'' this tech for electric skateboard use.. in which case it would be a bit lame.. same as like patenting a specific power transmission for all car models and then take all the rights to use such system on only approved / their made cars.

They can patent the use of them on skateboards. I dont see why that would be lame.
I can assure you the freeboard design is also patented by someone already and if they are not paying royalties then that person can sue lief if they wanted too.

It's not a freebord because it has a motor on it, freebord doesn't have Motors on it and thusly is technically a different product with a similar design that uses Caster wheels. The specific design that they put together they patented, they literally just got their patent last week. The ride is incredibly smooth and the ability to manually stop sideways and speed check yourself on it is great for bumps in the road. It's nice because if you hit a bump and you think you're going to fall you can kind of hit and edge and correct yourself very easily. It's definitely one of the most unique things that I have ever owned, the owner of the company is incredibly nice, he's going out riding with me in the park today. And as someone just said freebord is as well it's own patented design, that's why you won't find any other company that makes freebord, and because the leif is technically a different design they do not pay any royalties to freebord. Freebords have free moving Caster wheels whereas leif has motor resistance that you have to contend with by using your acceleration.

Saying it is not a freeboard is like saying our electric skateboards are not skateboards because they have motors in them or that electric bikes are not bikes because they have motors in them. 

It is a freeboard and there actually are several companies that make freeboards. Freebord is only the most popular since it has been around since the seventies. I'm not saying that the guys at Leif are bad guys or that they shouldn't have their patent. By all means, they should protect their product. As I said though, the creator of freebord could probably sue on the basis that he's patented the use of caster wheels on skateboards the exact same way they do. He probably doesn't care.

Once again one has free moving casters, the Leif does not, second no other companies make freebord besides freebord, third freebord was created in the early 90's not the 70's. Lastly an electric skateboard is not a skateboard, skateboards require you to kick in order to move, whereas an electric skateboard does not, differing designs mean different products. That's like telling me a car with motors is just copying the Flintstones car because they both move and have steering wheels, one requires a neanderthal with strong legs to drive, the other does not.

An electric skateboard is a powered skateboard...A lief is a powered Freebord. Semantics. There is no way to argue the point because Facts are facts and opinions are well...just that. 

Fact is, the guys at lief most definitely at some point before they made their product saw a freebord or rode a freebord and thought about how cool it would be to power one...Why? because they also were familiar with how fun powered longboards were to ride. 

I tried to talk to you on facebook awhile back and you went crazy and blocked me...Now, it kind of feels like you'll do it here again with @PXSS.

Hard to read your motivation to shamelessly promote one product everywhere if you're not being paid. You should try all of the other gear out there though before you talk up one and downplay others in such expert fashion.

If I blocked you it was likely because you are such a rock to talk to that you don't inherently take in any information in because you are just stubborn.  I don't waste my time in circular arguments with people who have nothing to add or argue to a conversation. If theres another company that makes freebords they are likely licensed by freebord because they do have a patent on their design. Aaron the owner is a snowboarder and actually had never ridden a freebord so another point void for you. Finally to the point you just made "a fact is a fact", they are different products not the same. If a company called skateboard existed and licensed out the rights to other companies to make skateboards and then Joe Shmo comes along and makes a similar design with a motor attached to it (its a different product using a similar design concept). Thanks for reminding me why I blocked you though as you have pretty much brought up more and more circular arguments that don't advance your point, they just prove how friggin stubborn you are to give credit to other people. Either way everything on this planet is unoriginal, everyone copies off of other peoples designs and either changes it, improves it or makes it different, that doesn't make those things the same products as they have been modified and changed to represent something completely different than the original. But don't be frustrated because you have yet to come up with a good point to argue the product besides saying COPYCAT COPYCAT COPYCAT!!! To PXSS I'm not screwing anyone, I happen to like a product and think that the company behind is a cool and original design and at most would hope to become a product representative in the future if that position were open, which it is not. Not only that you have chauvinistic one sided argument like accusing me of sleeping with the owner because apparently all women must be sleeping with someone because they support something? I don't come out and accuse you of sleeping with the owner of Trampa boards because you're on a DIY forum because that would be an immature and stupid thing to say. Okami seems to have some sense here and realizes like I do that the company was smart and got ahead of the game by taking a "Concept" that which is freebord and taking it in an entirely different direction. None the less that the product feels more like a snowboard than a freebord because that's what they were aiming for, and that's even what they programmed the computer that controls the motors to emulate by adding motor resistance to recreate that feeling.

No but I would love to! I simply think it's a great product and like to back up things that I enjoy. I'm a life long snowboarder who grew up in Colorado going to the mountains all the time and this product is literally one my favorite things I've invested in and owned in a long time. I love the fact that I can carve up hills, something a freebord can't do and I think the company has delivered a top quality product. I'm just a person who gets personally excited when I really love something and likes to talk about it. I like sharing my experiences with the product because I think other snowboarders would absolutely fall in love with this product during the summer when they aren't able to bomb down a mountain. Also there is incredibly limited information on the product online and I believe in sharing the wealth of knowledge I have on it in order to help others make informed decisions about a product before they make the $1700 investment into it. I'm sorry if that bothers some people that a person actually is excited about something they own and use on a daily basis. How many freeborders can say they commute to work on their freebord? How many snowboarders can commute to their work down a mountain? To me its just awesome, I get to do a sport I very much love every day without the restrictions of weather or needing a hill and gravity in order to do so.

Yeah and with a longboard you typically need slide gloves to help make those slides because of how you have to shift your body weight in order to accomplish it. The leif you can just kind of bend your knees similar to a snowboard in order to do that. I just got down doing pretty consistent 180's and some basic spins on it but once the board goes goofy and my right foots in front I'm absolutely awful at getting out of that, need to take a few days and practice so I can move up to doing 360 spins etc... When I go out with the local nyc e-skate crew I feel absolutely burnt out like I do at the end of a day of snowboarding, its great exercise!
