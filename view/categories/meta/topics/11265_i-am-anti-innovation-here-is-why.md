Because @onloop told me so...  

I fear that newcomers will read the VESC-X release thread, and only see the baseless claims Enertion made. Practically anything critically constructive in that thread gets put down. Guess it's easier to sell something when there aren't any comments (in plain sight) to bring it back down to reality.

Perhaps I'm pessimistic, but I have seen this happen on so many forums *cough*head-fi*cough* and I'd hate to see it happen here as well.

He is talking about the new VESC-X, he was questioning enertion's claims on the other thread.  And Jason had asked him to make a seperate thread to keep the other one on topic.  So he did.

I'll be looking into the most recent changes as well and will start prototyping one as well.

I think the main thing I'd wish is if it was 100% bulletproof and reliable but that will happen until we do even more testing.

I do agree, we've all been waiting on the VESC 6.0 and we should be more pro-active in resolving all these issues ourselves.

**So what you are saying is;**

1. You want me to continue to sell the old vesc and never EVER try to make improvements?
2. what to tell people who have DRV issues OR overheating problems? Should i explain I have some solutions but members of the esk8 forum don't permit me to offer it? 
3. You want me to sit on my hands and wait to be spoon fed by vedders work? 
4. You don't want me to use words to explain how products have been improved?


**Maybe you would like to explain to the thousands of esk8 builders why you don't want better products to be made available?**

This is too funny. no point in standing still

I get development costs but, same firmware, 97% same hardware, just a new board layout.......

I think some of the flagging in the main thread is too much and to the point of censorship. But that being said, why not make a new topic and move that discussion there? on either side...

You also can't tie this once experience back with innovation. There's plenty of innovators out there, and many different attitudes. What I don't get in this whole thing is why is everyone so upset over him fixing at least SOME OF the problems we all knew existed? The first few are always a bit more because manufacturers spend more time perfecting their assembling techniques.

Yea we understand that it needs to happen but we would all so like you to take on board the constructive criticism and built it better than hiding all the posts. By taking on board what the customer has to say and building the trust and honour to them. Everyone know that we'll know saying "customers always right" so if you can start to take in board what people are saying about your products and not hide the negative ones you should be able to rectify the negative by keeping them there and addressing them correctly.

Yes, do improve this open source hardware. Do share (with a usable file format, not PDF). But don't go and charge an extortionate price for this revised tech, lie about BOM costs, then accuse the forum for being anti-innovative as a way to paint yourself as a Martyr. 

I'm getting sick of this 'either you're with me, or you're against innovation' preaching.

I'll say it again, please try to be reasonable for once. You are being a tad childish.

So, you believe the vesc-x is cheaper to manufacture than the old vesc because someone random person quoted the price of some MOSFETs & capacitors? and this "evidence" is justification to call me a liar?

Firstly, let me say that unless this random person knows the exact qty of each component purchased & the exact supplier of each part I purchased it from he cannot know the cost & you are a fool for using it as a basis for your attack. Furthermore, he would also need to know the cost of assembly labor & testing labor. Finally, it's fairly obvious that the VESC-X will cost more because it has a CNC heat sink & shockproof molded case which didn't have to be made for the old VESC.

This is just pointless, nothing i say will change your mind so please just stop.

Welcome to the enertion forums lol. Honestly dude, it's not worth the trouble.There are a lot of loyal enertion followers on this forum because they been buying products from him since 2014, and they well always censor you. I told Jason to stay off the forums, but he doesn't get it. Arguing with his customers on a public forum makes his company look so bad, but he doesn't seem to care. He is like Russel Crowe on that Southpark episode where he goes around the world picking fights with random people. His company would be doing so much better if he would just ignore all the comments on his forum and just sell his product. Just look at Evolve. You don't see the owner of Evolve on this forum arguing with every negative comment about his product, and their boards are always back ordered.

@onloop I have a very very very constructive feedback:

1) You are not providing PCB source files, but you **must** because of CC license. I want to order PCB's at oshpark and buy all components myself because it will be twice cheaper. But you are **greedy** and want **everyone** to buy from you.

2) Instead of just donating to Vedder without any complications (like @chaka does) you figure out some impossible way when Vedder needs to register in your shop and start asking people to buy your product. This will never happen! He has dignity! He will not promote the product that has diverged and is not open source.

After you address the above, you can talk about innovation.

Thanks for the advice, However I politely decline to abide.

Want my advice? to anyone who doesn't want to hear from a passionate founder of a business who is constantly striving hard to innovate & working to educate people & build an industry, they should deactivate their accounts.

Alternatively, they could try to contribute back to the community by making some thoughtful well-researched comments instead of trying to start arguments & trolling.

I should not have to restrict my input on the forums because of a select few people who spend their time trying to derail my vision.

I like to believe you're a resourceful businessman, yourself. In no doubt of my mind do you have the business reach and resourcefulness to maintain a product with competitive pricing. 

Unless you are sourcing from entirely different suppliers, the basic component costs (capacitors, resistors, etc.)  should be roughly the same, perhaps slightly more, than from before. For the upgraded FETs, I can't comment. Given your business's size and implied sales velocity however, I can't imagine that you aren't able to attain lower component prices from your suppliers. 

Of course it's obvious that the heatsink plus labor will costs more. Be it another 60ish dollars worth it more, I don't know.

Enertion is not Evolve.
Evolve builds good expensive boards, which is nice.
Enertion builds a community and it's very important to be part of the community and not become just a random supplier.

Discussion and (fair) critisism is part of DIY to make things better, don't take every criticism personal.

the fact is enertion does make some profit. if we didn't make profit we wouldn't exist. nor would this forum, nor would vesc-x......

my staff wouldn't have jobs, emails wouldn't get answered

there would be nothing to show.

I have nothing to hide.

The price of the VESC-X is extremely fair & it is actually cheaper than many other vendors who sell standard VESC & it will outperform standard VESC's

Can you please explain how you can come with this conclusion ? The CC licence explicitely states that you have to share the changes made to the original licenced design. The dign includes des PCB files and the full routing. How come that you do not have to share the modifications you have made to this licenced product ?

If things evolve in the direction of individual not beeing able to get a PCB and solder their own VESC, I would see it a extremely detrimental to the VESC community. VESC community was open source at the beginning and I have the impression that you are pushing it torward a community where individuals will not be able to get the information pto produce their own VESC and forced to buy it. 
I hope that Vedder will be able to save the opensource mind of his original project but I see that all actors are not pusching in the same direction. 

This is sad.

I have a suspicion that onloop developed vesc-x in Regards to chaka's closed source version of Vedders open source project.

If Vedders Aware then Its up to Vedder. I can understand why onloop has only released the schematic, seems some people here would be ungrateful anyway no matter what he does.

All your sources - Altium project and related files (schematics, PCB, BOM, etc.) - must be shared under the same license as original.

There is a reason why the VESC is open in all other formats - KiCad schematics, Gerber/PCB, BOM list, etc.  ...because CC license is applied to the work and not to the format or medium the work was shared in/with. _This is enforced by the chosen CC license which declares that the same work in any other format or medium must be shared and distributed under the same license._

You should know these as you referred to the CC rules when you told others that they must share changes on components list / BOM.

This post by @guyguy  helps to explain it. The hardware is not covered by the cc license. In fact, it is generally recommended not to use CC license for hardware. However, we still may consider releasing the source files later.

[quote="guyguy, post:76, topic:11102, full:true"]
A lot of people cite the creative commons licenses for hardware but it's not really applicable. The license is a copyright license which offers very little protection when it comes to software and no protection when it comes to hardware (normally you have to go the patent route for protection). The original intent of copyrights was to protect authorship and publication rights for books so these protections weren't ever really envisioned to protect objects like computer hardware. This is alluded to in their FAQ:

https://creativecommons.org/faq/#general-license-information

 

Hardware can't be protected by copyright. Software can be, but it's easy to circumvent because functionality can't be copyrighted so, you can basically re-write a code and not be subject to copyright -- most likely have to go patent route to do anything. Onloop is only bound by the CC license insofar as it relates to work that is actually copyrightable, like the images or written materials that Vedder published. If it's just new hardware he's pushing out it doesn't really apply unless there's a patent.

to be honest once released someone somewhere will strip one down and build a copy of it if it works and start to produce it anyway. So weather or not you decide to release it it will get copied once release so you may as well share the files and save your self any hassle for not share in getting into issues with veddar.

The truth is Chaka set a precedence by not sharing..... he opened the door.

However, there is one simple difference.

1. Chaka makes claims his hardware is upgraded but provides no details about the upgrades when asked for them. Still hasnt. The best he did was refer users to vedders forum to 'read'

2. I make claims about new upgraded hardware. I provide specific details of changes. I also provide schematics. No one had to ask me once.

Everyone can be innovative and develop something new. Innovation can be also - as in this case - only enhancement to something already exists.
It's up to an innovator to decide whether to crate something new and define the rules for it or to reuse an existing solution following its rules.

[quote="SORRENTINO, post:44, topic:11265"]
Its this type of bu#lSh%t that slows down innovation
[/quote]

How did you get to this? 
What if someone would make VESC-X even better? If the proper sources would be shared, it would be far more easier to continue the innovation instead of wasting time redoing from VESC 4.12. So actually those sources would speed up innovation!

Wow, I haven't been notified this many times in a new topic in a long time! I see a lot of accusations and assumptions and I would like to clear a few things up. Anyone wanting to know what components we have changed are welcome to them, we have listed them to several people in emails and forum messages. 

Good job to @onloop for switching over to direct fets but at first glance I can see many missing capacitors, most likely due to switching from 15uf 50v caps to 4.7uf 100v.  Don't let the numbers fool you, the higher voltage caps perform better.

In regards to releasing these gerbers for this modified version. I don't think he needs to "legally " but there is nothing stopping anyone from creating a version of there own using kicad. As vedder has said before, creating the pcb is the easy part. A vesc pcb revision can take as little as a few hours in the hands of an experienced kicad user.

Interesting to hear vedder is not going to open source v6 @onloop . Seems very uncharacteristic of him and highly unlikely. I can see how he might since it now looks like you have not been sending him any support this year judging by your donation policy.

I would ask you to rethink your willingness to send vedder support and to please start sending him donations freely as both @elkick and I do. It is the only ethical thing to do if you are going to use his development and software.

I agree ben needs something out of this, I am working on a more consistent transparent renumeration model through the new affiliate network. However we wanted to move beyond the donation model to something more substantial. 

This year we made an offer to vedder to allow him to work full time on the vesc exclusively for the esk8 community. The timing wasnt right and the offer was declined. But the door is still open for us to work together in the future if possible.. I am sure Vedder would be happy to work full time on the vesc, but he needs to do it under the right circumstances and of course it's a big decision for him as he has a job already. However Its likely Ben has other bigger plans that don't necessarily include esk8 related vesc developments. Plenty of opportunities knocking at his door due to the success of the vesc platform.

Anyway. We decided to move forward and invest in and develop our own hardware version in the meantime whilst Ben decides his path. We will continue to focus our contributions to the esk8 industry and community in the most beneficial ways we can as that is our primary passion.

That sounds like a whole lot of double speak for "I am not going to send him donations". We send him donations regularly and they are quite substantial. I suggest you do the same if you are going to continue to use the VESC source.

I do commend you for at least being open about your lack of support and donations to Vedder and how you want him to join your crew. I have grown to know Benjamin well and I seriously doubt he will be pulling away from the open source community anytime soon.

@onloop, I hope this is constructive. I think this has just been a bit of a stumble in your marketing practices, not R&D or innovation or other tangential thing. The way it looks on this forum to offer the originator of the VESC an affiliate rewards system in an open-source community, when other vendors have set a precedent of paying a license fee to Veddar, is what has rankled so many folks (personally I'm indifferent, I'm just saying this is how others feel). We're in an age of marketing by ethics - look at Toms Shoes, Chipotle, Warby Parker (sorry these are all U.S. brands but I assume this trend exists in AU too) and the list goes on, which means that more and more consumers look to their internal ethics when they make a purchasing decisions. So, within the culture/ethics of an open source community this just hasn't looked great, whereas in other communities offering an affiliate program may look very generous. 

Of course you're not obligated to contribute to Veddar at all (I think all those arguments saying you're required to fall flat), but if you did it would do a lot for the optics of this situation - even if the license amount is nominal. 

So far I think your marketing has been brilliant - full of pluck and openness and I'm impressed with how much penetration you've gotten. That being said, no one can expect things to be perfect all the time though and launches are especially difficult. I hope this is helpful.

Your retail prices are a tad higher so I suppose you can afford to be more generous. We make very little profit on the current vesc we sell so makes it harder to donate substantial amount like you do.

However I do think the new affiliate model will work well as it will give vedder the ability to earn a direct commission if he chooses. Also other affiliates can choose to donate their comssion, or part of, to the vedder.

I generally think the broader community should directly chip in more if they want more updates and releases. If every forum members paid just $1 per month to vedder he would be very well funded. I would also be willing to promote a fund raising campaign and use this forum as a platform to promote it.

Either vendors charge more and pass it on. Or, Vendors charge less and community pays it forward. Same same.

Id say that most vesc vendors probably don't donate much if anything to vedder.  Which is a bit sad.. None of the Chinese factories will donate that's for sure.

Honestly, i focus my donations more towards the community..... I do it via offering my own open source wares, my motor mounts have been downloaded thousands of times by people all over the world. There are people using the design for fun & tgere are sone selling my design too. On this forum!!

I have never received a single donation for my works and I really don't make a point of asking.

I also host this website and cover the monthly fees. So the community can share their works and vendors can merchandise their wares.. 

I also personally wrote 90% of the vesc FAQ user articles on here to help people use the vesc.... before i did that there was very limited documentation online... this is many hours of time donated.

So I suppose I could increase my vesc prices and donate more. I could also donate less to building this community and the industry that serves as a platform for which my competitors grow their businesses on.

At the end of the day I think we all just need to give as much as we can afford. I promise When I'm rich I'll give everyone some more money...

The good news is I started to pay myself a wage for the first time last month... now I can help support my wife and two babies & If I keep doing well I can eventually afford to support someone else.

I think that many of us in the community would be more than glad to donate $1 per month to vedder. It is saddening to hear vedder did not want to work full time on the vesc.

To @onloop: I get confused some times between whether your in this for the money or for the passion and desire to innovate eskates. But what I think is that if you really are just about the money, you could be in another, more profitable industry. Not to say eboards can't be profitable, just that you have great marketing skills, and you could easily make big bucks promoting a multi-million dollar company in another more established industry. And I think developing the VESC-X makes it crystal clear that you are in it for the passion and to help evolve the industry.

To the community: I've had my differences with @onloop in the past. I've been relentless at times. But at some point, you have to just move on. A lot of this complaining and harassing (which is what these flagged posts really are) is so counter productive. I agree the community should know the facts about any given seller, but address your frustrations, and move on. Some of you have been doing this for 6 months+. The amount of Jasons' time your eating up by dragging this out could have been used to fix the bugs your complaining about... It's not easy running a company, especially one that's blown up like his has. I wish sometimes there was more open communication. But at this point, he's dammed if he does something new (VESC-X) and dammed if he keeps to same (in my opinion flawed) VESC. That's not fair (and 2 wrongs don't make a right either).

And to those complaining about the price. Understand 2 things:

- The first few of a new product is usually more expensive, some times far more expensive, than the final price.
- Electric skateboards are not cheap toys. Period. How much do you value your life? Falling at 30 mph is not pretty (I have done this thanks to an exploding FVT 120a) unless your wearing full leathers, which I haven't seen any of us wearing. Both @onloop and I (and I'm sure many other members on here) have experienced the false economy. I experienced it even with enertions products (but especially with hobby grade parts). Cheaper does not mean better, it means more risk. It might work out fine, or it might blow up on you and cost you more money. I wish at the time, I hadn't been cheap, and just coughed up the money for 2 chaka vescs instead of buying 2 unproven quality vescs from enertion. Wasted 200 bucks and I basically ended up paying $520 for 2 working vescs instead of $320.

The quality of the VESC-X is unproven. But it looks promising. I hope I get a chance to test one.
The Direct Fets should make a big difference, and shorter traces are always better.

If 20 are produced and 10 of those customers are complaining of problems and getting no help, then your justified to be on here complaining in my mind. But you haven't even given them a chance... Even if there are issues, this is a step in the right direction.

I actually asked a productive question but it was skipped because of all the complaining about a new product that none of you have even tested. While the community needs openness, there has to be structure to it. At the end of the day, creating a new thread like this is all that you needed to do if you wanted to complain. But complaining isn't going to fix your problems. Do your research, and understand that if your not willing to through down some serious bucks for a vesc, your taking a gamble. At the prices he's charging, he would go bankrupt tomorrow if he included a warranty at the current price point. And that doesn't benefit anyone here...

Don't believe everything you hear. Vedder has been spending all his free time developing the new programing for the VESC. Just because Benjamin did not accept Jason's offer to come work for him privately does not mean he is not dedicated to the project. What saddens me is when people who have profited on the VESC spread rumors our flat out lies about a developer with such good nature. Many people do not know this but Vedder scrapped thousands of lines of code to make the bldc-tool/vesc-tool more easily modified and amended. He deserves our respect!

You guys are being incredibly hard on Jason, as far as I'm concerned he has done nothing wrong and is doing a wonderful job supporting the community. Something most VESC manufacturers are not doing. He has provided source as far as he is legally obliged, and done his best to improve a product that many people on this forum have had issues with.

I find the idea of Jason doing this solely for the money ridiculous. It is clear that he puts an incredible amount of work into Enertion. Someone with his abilities, and determination could be doing many other things, making much more money.

Thanks @onloop for providing these forums, and pushing this hobby forward. Ignore the people that refuse to provide any legitimate criticism and may have little perspective as to how difficult doing what you've accomplished is.

Oh I'm sure he is dedicated. What I meant, is that I wish as a community, we could somehow come together to help fund him so that he can afford to work on this project full time. I'm sure you send quite a bit to him @chaka, and If I'm paying an extra $5 or $10 bucks per vesc knowing that it's going to vedder, I'm more than happy to.

Even if Jason was to start sending money to vedder for every vesc he sells, I don't know if vedder would quit his job to spend more time working on this. I get your frustration, cause I'm sure your price scares off a lot of customers. And part of that price is there to donate to vedder. But it is also his choice of how to run his business. I wish he donated say $5 per vesc to vedder, but the problem is also that the community as a whole keeps complaining about high prices. 

Everyone needs to understand, that vescs are not cheap. Buying a vesc when you have $400 budget is like saying I need a car on a budget and buying a Tesla. The VESC is a luxury speed controller. And vedder deserves compensation for it. By pricing them so low, vedder loses which is not fair, since we are all benefiting from his hard work. So stop demanding low prices, and accept that VESCs are not cheap to make, and part of the cost your paying is for vedder to keep improving it.

Jason introduced the VESC to much of this community, and recently Jerimiah, you have been the driving force of improvement. I wish there was a way we could all work together instead of tearing each other apart... There's so much that can be done if we combine our work and ideas. This argument is one of the reasons I always say capitalism kills innovation. Profit is always more important than innovation in a capitalistic society.

Not only that, I'm sure Boosted, Evolve and other kickstarters have taken from VESC and contributed nothing back nor given any credit to Vedder with the exception being ArcBoards. The irony here is you're one of the good guys trying to do the right thing and getting blasted for it when there are many unseen actors taking, not giving back and getting no negative feedback at all -- they're the real bad guys here.

I think your intent is in the right place but my advice is that this comission model runs contrary to the open source culture. I can see this affiliate model as exciting for someone like you because you're accustomed to wearing multiple hats that include sales and marketing. Vedder hasn't shown an interest in sales. To the community (myself _excluded_) it looks like you're trying to turn him into a salesperson when the community would rather see you support him in something he does well and likes - develop. I think there's probably a good middle ground here, for example, something similar to Amazon's smile program where if people put in a coupon code a portion of the proceeds will go to vedder and then offer a badge on this forum or something like that. I don't know what the answer is exactly though and I think this issue is a complex one.

@evoheyax I am actually not frustrated at all and really wish everyone would cut Jason and his engineers some slack. Vedder, as far as I know, does not feel anyone using his open source files needs to publish the gerber files of everything derived. If anyone wants to build a VESC with direct fet technology it is easy. Vedder made sure to use Kicad for this very reason. He wants everyone to have access regardless of access to expensive proprietary software.

I made a direct fet VESC earlier this year but I stopped development after a few conversations with Vedder and his commencement of version 5 and now v6. This was about the time I was pushing single drive boards to their limits.

Personally I am very much a capitalist and I view open source to be the purest form of capitalism where good service and manufacturing decides who does well and succeeds. In open source you can not hide behind patents and rest on your hands. If you produce using open source everyone else has free access to use your breakthroughs and build on them. This does not mean you need to spoon feed your competition any information or manufacturing files ect.

Would I like Jason to donate to Benjamin? Yes, but he is by no means obligated to do so or even tell us if he has. The last thing anyone should do is attempt to shame him for his reluctance. 

So please stop pushing his buttons everyone, there is no joy in it.

This isn't rocket science, everyone wants to scream but no one except @onloop (although the idea does seem to be done halfheartedly) has anything to offer. At this point if Jason sells his VESC at cost people will still complain.

@onloop feels like you're a very controversial figure in the DIY esk8 community. :neutral_face:
