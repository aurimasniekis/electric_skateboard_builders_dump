This forum needs a "reply to email" feature for threads. Does it have it / can it be enabled?

Massively easier to use!

The forum runs on discourse forum software. So if you go on their website and they have that feature @onloop may be able to add it.

You do? When I get an email from the forum I go on and then delete it afterwards, with out looking at it. So I went back and looked at some 'recent' emails from the forum and i did not have it. Idk, maybe I'm missing something.

@lox897 so you can reply to an email and it adds the reply to the thread?

Reply to the email. I don't want to have to click the button then go to the site then type my response then close the window then delete the email. Rather just reply to email & delete email.
