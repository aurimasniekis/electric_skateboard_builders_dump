So i just noticed that there is now a slim banner ad at the top of the forum for an enertion deal.

Personally i think it's a little scummy for a company who says this is a completely open forum to start advertising in ways that others can not.

Also i think ads are annoying, i would much rather see a post about the deal, then people could talk about it also.

what do you guys think?

I think if I paid to host a website for an entire community of people who regardless of what I do, aren't necessarily going to buy my stuff, that I'd do the same thing. Frankly, I would have sold top and side banners to my competitors by now if I was Jason. My 2c.

Who said others can't advertise?  I acknowledge your complaint, however this is a trial, will need to analyse the datat and see what happens. 

Unfortunately there will have to be some monetization at some point if this forum is to continue to be operational and we'll kept. 

It's been running for 12months with zero ads and funded out of my pocket... someone needs to pay the server fees and I can guarantee the other vendors who I freely allow to access this forum to promote their own products aren't going to chip in to help.

Also... it's a really hot deal.... the community has been begging for better prices on these items... and this deal will also allow me to fill my distributors warehouses with stock so that my overseas friends don't have to pay 30% import duties....

If I don't get the necessary numbers the entire deal falls through.... so I need the support of the community to make it happen.... I don't think to many people will mind....

I had a longer thing typed out but in writing it up i realized my main issue with this.

I think ads would be fine (banner ads, side ads, no popups though), but I think they should link to a post on the forum, not another website. 1. that would allow people to talk about the company/deal 2. it helps protect against malicious ads/links.

I think, if you'd be open to it, plenty of members would be willing to chip in. This would not necessarily cover all your costs. But it might help a bit. I'd personally be willing to 'donate' for sure!

When it comes down to it, its @onloop 's forum. He's is the one managing it and most importantly paying for it. Its not cheap, at all. I get that it is a community forum but the community does not pay the bill. (granted a few people would chip in) So I really do not mind Enertion, Ollin, DIY, Jacob Bloy, Hummie, or myself to advertise (paid) on here. I do also see @Karmannghiagirl 's point, but I feel if they are member of the community with eSk8 businesses it would be appropriate to have outside links, because I am sure there is a topic all ready created about it. (like @onloop having a sale thread with all the nitty gritty details that may not be on his website)  

Any way that is my two cents.

i think you should advertise. the forum cost money to run. sell some ad space to other people. whoever doesn't like it can go and pay to be on another forum. the only issue i have is what about the people that want the limited offer but also need a wireless controller?  :sob:

Definitely gives a little bit of a proprietary vibe which I think misrepresents the true nature of this forum.  Is it something I could live with...sure, but I do feel like it could give wrong impression to new members or first time visitors. Don't blame @onloop one bit for trying to monetize the forum though.

@onloop I'm not so sure about that, although I'm a member and not a competitor\vendor, I would gladly chip in some money if you started a donation model for the forum. I bet that others would offer donations as well. If everyone chipped in a small amount I bet we could cover costs to operate the site.

I also don't see a problem with you monetizing the site. So sell ads if that's what keeps it going!

Ads are part of the deal and on most forums.  I don't mind them at all.  Almost all forums i visit usually have a few.  Somebody has to pay for the hosting and when you have an active user community they are valuable to market to.  I ignore the ones i don't like and click some that look interesting.

I'd ask they stay skate and esk8 focused.  Start having viagra or the super annoying "this _one thing_ will save-your-life/help-you-lose-20lbs!" and i'm going to be hanging out elsewhere.

**I can 100% guarantee that non-related ads will never be shown on this forum....**

my original dream for this forum is to promote the global movement of esk8 builders, this includes the various vendors, as @oneafrikan said **"a rising tide lifts all boats"**

I know well that if my competitors are doing good business they will also be marketing their products and actively promoting products to the market & educating the masses as a whole, this is good for everyone involved.

I also know that my competitors would have had a huge amount of traffic going to their website due to the creation of this website.... this platform benefits everyone....

When I first saw it, I thought it was kinda shady, since this hasn't been an option for other vendors. I get its your forum, but if its your forum, and you use it in ways other vendors can't, then it's not a forum for the community. It's being used in a way other vendors can't to sell your products. So enough with "this forum is for the community" if you utilize the forum to promote your business. I get that other companies have grown because of this forum, and that has benefited the community. But in my eyes, it's either for the community or for your own profit. I would be fine chipping in to help hosting, as many others have stated. It's annoying to see "this forum is for the community" and "it's my forum, so I can do what I want" in the same post. If its forum for the community, then these kinds of things would be the choice of the community, and not the owner

 - my 2 cents

I have only been on this forum for 4-5 months, but have derived enormous value and spent a lot of time absorbing the knowledge. Would gladly pay as a member for such access, and see no real issue with you trying to pay the bills. For me, you are actually enabling this to exist, and in many ways enabling the community to financially support the forum itself. What do I mean by that?  From my perspective, advertising on this forum is buying access to me and my time. I do not mind that, and without Jason's efforts I would not be able to monetize my time in support of forum infrascture costs. Additionally, if advertising is ek8-related, I view it as either relevant information content I would like to explore or it is something I can choose to ignore. It's not like it's a pre-roll sitting between me and where I want to go. Anyway, just my 2$. Lol!

Do you have something against long hard deck???? :stuck_out_tongue:


I figure this. It's onloop's forum. He pays for it, he manages it, and he can do whatever he wants with it. All I have is thanks for all the hard work that's gone into keeping this forum going. There's absolutely no reason there shouldn't be Enertion promos running on it. It's just a little banner at the top. It doesn't distract from the usability of the forum. It's not like you have to look at an ad before viewing any post or some annoying crap. This forum has to fund itself. Yes there could be donations, but that's up to onloop as well. 

The only issues I have with it is that it's kind of cramped up there, the hue of red could be a little cooler, and it should be in bold to match up better since it's sitting above a really heavy dark bar. Perhaps have a full bar of color with the copy knocked out in white. 

Plus, it's a damn good deal! If I was looking for that setup, I'd be jumping on that!

..Personally, I'd be selling ad space.

Imo The ad is fine, viewing it on my phone only see the ad when scrolling to the top and I totally see that if he is the only one paying the bill for this amazing forum that he should get to put ads where he wants and its the first time I'm see any ads who's to say that he wasn't planning on selling ad space to other vendors so let's not bite his head off just yet

I haven't read everything cos I'm on my way to work, but:

How would you feel if:
As member (logged in) - no ads
As visitor / non-member (not logged-in) - ads

That way the contributors don't get noise; and the lurkers help pay for costs. 

And then: @onloop opens up ads to anyone who is a member with a viable esk8 product, and that ad has to point to:
A) a post which can be discussed
B) a site which belongs to a member 
C) an event which will benefit the community
D) there may be other good ones...

So - no spam, no viagra, no silly banners telling me to get Virgin Media. Just more eboard stuff. 

Thoughts??

Yes. I feel like Entortion is the IKEA of DIY electric skateboards. Because of them, there's a lot more people buying kits, assembling them, and calling them "DIY".

There's nothing wrong with that though. After all, people who assemble their own e-boards are just as happy as the people who build them from scratch.

The problem lies within this forum. Everyone who wants to build an electric skateboard ends up here, and since this forum is run by Entortion (correct me if I am wrong here), they are instantly sucked into the idea that they need to spend hundreds of dollars on Entortion products, like their motor mounts, motors, and their "platinum VESC's" in order to make a good e-board.

**No**. Go out, cut a piece of aluminum with a jigsaw, and weld it onto a pair of Paris trucks. There's your $15 motor mount. You've not only saved money, but you have also learned how to work with metal. Same thing goes for batteries. Go on HobbyKing, buy some LiPo's, and solder them together to a BMS. Congrats! You've made a SPACE cell, saved money, and learned valuable skills. 

Motor not suiting you? Do some research, go on different hobby sites, and find the cheapest motor that fits your specs. And what if you want the ultimate experience IMHO? **Solder your own VESC** :O You'll get a sweet ride, and you'll learn how to handle SMDs!

or...not.  I don't want to do all that crap, nor do I want to get the tools or equipment needed for it.  

I'd rather just buy kits and assemble them, even though that's not a "true" diy from scratch.  Heck I'm so lazy, I'd rather just pay an awesome builder to make the exact board I want and have it come to me complete...and then tinker with it if needed.

As for @onloop, you could create some fixed ad spots that can we rented out. So other people like @Hummie, @chaka, @jacobbloy,... could advertise their products too, and you still get some money off it which you can use to fund the forum..

I have a real problem with the Enertion ad.

Not ads in general, but this is the first time I've witnessed @onloop using the forum (that although he pays for we the members provide the content) to gain an advantage over his competition. This DOES come across as shady.

Did any other vendor get a chance to put an ad up?
Who decides the price and timing, etc.., um Enertion, that is a bit scary to me as a consumer.

It's always made me feel a bit uneasy that the forum was hosted by a vendor, but until now Enertion has done a pretty good job saying neutral.

I have to say it would have been just as good of a deal posted in the forum like everyone else, no?

One of the reasons this forum exists is because it's a marketing tool for Enertion. Onloop built it, runs it, and pays for it. He should definitely have an advantage over the competition. We all know full well that it's an Enertion forum. I'm just thankful that Onloop openly allows his competition to market on his forum. He would be entirely in the right to ban any outside marketing, but he doesn't and that's awesome. It shows that while he is running a business, he is also here to help build the DIY esk8 community.

Not for me its not. lol

But joking aside, DIY is DIY. Buying a kit or winding your own motors, you're still doing it yourself and you're learning things. think of it more like kits for beginners with more advanced people doing things like building packs and pressing decks. Its all DIY. For somebody who doesn't own a jigsaw or lathe or spot welder or soldering station, kits open the door to this wonderful world of better-than-off-the-shelf esk8s. 

@Mrmoonlight Agreed. While cultivating the community in this way is beneficial to him, its also beneficial to everyone else here. there are plenty of vendors here and plenty of opportunity to turn people on to their wares.

I originally came on this forum to research DIY esk8's. I ended up buying a SpaceCell, VESC, and remote from Enertion, but I also picked up a Carvon Hub and a deck from Funbox. So yeah, I still spent hundreds of dollars, but because of this forum I also purchased from other vendors. 

Sure, I could have machined my own hub motors, pressed my own deck, welded my own battery pack, vacuum formed my own enclosure, and soldered my own VESC, but I didn't want to. Tooling up would cost too much and I don't have the space for all that stuff. In the end, the tools and all the trial and error that goes into DIY at that level usually ends up costing more. I still came out with a sweet deck that's customized to my exact specs. Something I couldn't get on the open market and I still had to research all the parts, solder my connections, put it all together and program my VESC. I could have gone "more diy", but you can always do more. We have people on this forum making practically every piece of an electric board from scratch, but no one does it all. That's what makes this a DIY community.

Is there ESK8 as industry to choose? Also, for me the revenue for non-specialized ads is too low.
So if yo can get only related ads with little effort(which seems to be the case), i would not use adsense on one of my sites.
Also, i think it will looks less serious to use generic adsense stuff as everybody else does.

But only my 2 cents.

I still disagree. There's a lot of things you could have done that would have saved you a lot of money, even if you did screw up several times. I understand that not everyone has the space for tools in their home, and that's why these kits are useful to some.

But if you have the tools and the will-power to **actually** build an electric skateboard from scratch, then you won't find the necessary information on how to do that on this forum, or on Entortion's website. Instead, you will find articles/videos on how to "Build a DIY Electric Skateboard in 12 minutes!" which is a glorified way of saying "Assemble our kits." You will also find builds that use nothing but Entortion parts. 

And this goes back to the advertisement up at the top. That further promotes Entortion, and the idea that you have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a good, quality, DIY electric skateboard. Again, if you find yourself spending close to a $1000 on a DIY electric skateboard, you might as well buy a Boosted Board, because it is a far more polished and professional product.

Google tends to analyze the domain that the ads are hosted on, and serve products that are relevant to that domain. So maybe it would be things like hobby parts? And oh well, that's what ads generally come off as.

I helped build a CNC mill for less than $1000. Besides, I'm not talking about milling things out. I mean, motors are a little too difficult to make, I agree. But soldering your own battery pack? C'mon, that's cheap ($30 soldering iron). Motor mount and wheel mount? Literally, jigsaw. Maybe some 3D printed parts if you have one of those.

I don't consider myself cheap, and there are forums i pay for using.  However this is and has been built by the community, if the model were to switch to pay-to-use - i'd likely just go elsewhere.

I'm fine with ads, but the legitimate contributions has been from individuals, so to switch now would be keep me from continuing to contribute and help others.

I have definitely sent plenty of $ Enertion's way, and continue to send folks to them for components.

On the donations part, Jason has never said anything about not being able to support the forum. I get that it is expensive but I feel like donations would create to much work and tax headaches that in the end it would not be worth it. 

Just my three cents.

True, I could have saved myself a few bucks, but that was never my goal. Yes, some people go the DIY route to get a good electric board for less $$. Most of us go the DIY route because we enjoy the experience of building and tinkering with our own boards. It's not all about the money. 

Yes, if you went out and bought all the Enertion Raptor parts and simply put them all together, you'd have an Enertion Raptor in a few minutes. But there's nothing wrong with that, and who really cares?

It's unfortunate that a lot of people think this way. It doesn't lead to any innovations in electric skateboarding, and it just makes you a consumer.

some of us need a place like this because we are beginners like me who don't have the knowledge YET, I have time constraints like running my business and raising a family, and limited room for a 3d printer to make my own parts. this coming from me a guy that makes his own wh..is..key.., home craft beer, and my own reloading. (yes it is misspelled on purpose) there's not enough time to do all the things we want to.
BTW: thanks to Enertion's web site and the forum, I just ordered a deck, battery, dual motor kit (r uber +), vsec, 2.4 ghz controller, charger and extra 12mm belts. This after researching many different e skate web sites. ONLOOP...you're doing something right!

Would be great if there were an option to ''hide'' the banner.. I kind of hate it now when Im browsing / opening new thread using phone that the banner is the first one to show up.. and it gets stuck sometimes.. no forum just the banner ad..

Someone should come up with some background theory on banners / ads and psychology, impact on people.
