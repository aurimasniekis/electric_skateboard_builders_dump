I was wondering the same thing @onloop I commented in the lounge and none of the mods knew.

That is correct. Only @onloop can create a poll. Just use an online form maker and paste the link.

It requires custom 'code'. I created a poll in this [topic](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/v2-esk8-market-now-with-trade-assurance-and-paypal-suport-embedded-user-poll/5843/43)

Care to explain?

I don't see why this should be restricted from the community. No point in doing so.

It's probably an oversight / config issue. Be patient ;-)

I dont know if @onloop wants everyone to know, because if he did he would have told us by now. There have been multiple people asking. I can see why he may not want poles everywhere, it could gunk up the forum if used improperly, or over used. I am gonna let @onloop chime in. If he dosnt say anything if 1 - 2 days, i will make a thread about it.

Maybe @onloop we should make a poll asking if people want poll's on the forum. I only posted one, becuase i thought it was necessary'. I can see the pros and cons of polls on the forum.

Well, it is not that hard to find out.
2 Minutes google search.

Yes I know. I think we should put a hold on poll's until Jason gets back.

I'd say we should have polls, but only regulars or higher should be allowed to use them. We really don't need spam... I can already see it: each topic has a poll "should I or should I not get 2 motors?"

@anorak234 Yes that is exactly what I am talking about. The forum will be littered with them from people asking basic questions. I would agree that only regular's and mods should be able to create them. 

@link5505 why the disrespect? I said let's wait for Jason, and u just go figure out how and make your own poll. I don't get it.  

@barajabali I think u should split this to the lounge, so we can carry on in there, and not hijack this thread.

Creating a poll is really easy, 

All you need to do is wrap a list with` [poll][/poll]` in your post. Polls can be added to any post within a topic, and you can add multiple polls to your post. See http://blog.discourse.org/2015/08/improved-polls-in-discourse/ for further information.

Here is a short example for a singular poll in a post:

    [poll]
     - This is useful
     - This is pointless
     - I like tacos
    [/poll]
To add multiple polls to your post, you need to specify the name parameter:

    [poll name=examplePoll]
     - This is useful
     - This is pointless
     - I like tacos
    [/poll]
```

I feel like the forum will be littered with polls like what motor should I buy? What trucks are the best?

But on a serious note abt polls....

I don't think just any Manny, Moe or Jack should be able to make them...should be left to the folks with at least the "regular" status...

Nothing wrong with earring the right...but just to give permission from the get go...nah 

Just my opinion ....

You and link are the only regulars here ðŸ˜‚
