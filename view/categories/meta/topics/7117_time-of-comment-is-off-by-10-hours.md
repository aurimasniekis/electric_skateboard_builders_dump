Hi. I see every reply that has been sent within the last hour as if it has been sent 10 hours ago, and if it has been sent 1-2 hours ago it's written that it has been sent 11 hours ago, and so on...
It's not critical, but very annoying, is there something to do? 
Thanks.

Still have this problem? Otherwise check the timezone in your profile.  It is probably set incorrectly

I set the location, I don't see any timezone setting. Thanks
