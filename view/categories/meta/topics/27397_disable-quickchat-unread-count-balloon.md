i hate balloons on my icons, and there's constantly a balloon on this icon:

There are nothing to do with this.

Well looks like you are diagnosed with OCD.
Im sorry, you have less then 100 years left.

that's cause i keep clearing it every time, which is opening it then scrolling all the way to the bottom.

I found an easy solution for you. You just need the Chrome extension "AdBlock"

Right click the count balloon.  Then click AdBlock > Block this ad. Adjust the slider if needed. If you click the correct element, you can block the counter but maintain access to the chat...

Result:

I used the same thing to disable the painfully annoying popups on DIY's site....


**Update: This trick breaks other notifications too....**

Won't this also block your notifications for the site though? (like PMs, mentions, etc)

So after blocking the chat counter, I still get the green PM notifications over my avatar. But unfortunately it seems the thread notifications/mentions don't work anymore

Good catch @Smorto 

My little trick is not as useful as I had originally thought.  And I'm not sure how to unblock an "ad" :confused:
