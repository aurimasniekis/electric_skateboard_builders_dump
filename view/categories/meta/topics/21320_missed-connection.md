just took my board out for a spin in central park today.  I saw one of you guys at 104th and CPW, between 4:00 and 4:30.  I couldnt catch many details about your board but you were headed uptown and had a black motor that was mounted "outboard"

anyway it was cool seeing someone else from the community in the wild.

You should ride with the Boosted/NYC group. Bunch of riders in the area that usually hit up Central Part or Prospect park in Brooklyn.
