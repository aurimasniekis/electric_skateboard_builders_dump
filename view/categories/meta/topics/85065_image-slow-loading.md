Anyone else experienced that after some changes a few days ago?

First it loads a really low resolution preview and them loads if fully, sometimes it takes 10 seconds or more to each image to load, and they don't load simultaneously, taking even longer

For me images only load slowly when I click on one to see it larger; this is because it actually is loading all images in the post in full resolution simultaneously. Once the wait for the first one is over, you can view the others without waiting.

Update to discourse to help with bandwidth issues trying to load all images at once. It's a bit too conservative for my liking.
