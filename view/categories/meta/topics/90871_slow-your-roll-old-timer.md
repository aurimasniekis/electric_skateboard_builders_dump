Maybe we should stop telling new users to "search for it" when they come in asking simple questions. When I look back at the fish it was great until it reached the point that users started to feel entitled to be shitty ever time someone new would ask a simple question. Things also change, what was the norm 1 year or even 3 months ago might not be the go-to method today. 

And think about it this way, if everyone just searched for the info this place would get pretty quiet.

We have the noob thread for easy questions as well. No need for a thread for every topic. And I think I can say I definitely not often said people better to use the search function.

I only partly agree. Yeah, your right, we should help each other and sure it would be a lot quieter without all of those questions.\
But when I see threads like: "First build, recommend me parts" and the member who made it did 0 research I think it's appropriate to recommend the search function...

The way I see it, telling people to "search for it" is the beginning of the end for a forum, all the questions have been asked so that gives the devil on our shoulder the OK to work his magic and be a dickhead when a simple question is asked. Simply put, it can really kill the stoke for a new rider. 

Back when eskating was still new and custom boards where fairly unknown everyone was happy to give their parts list or even direct them to a $20 how to manual made with info poached off of endlesssphere. We used it as an opportunity to discuss and sometimes new ideas would form from those discussions.

As you said by your own before, what was actual yesterday might be old today. There is still a lot of things to talk about. And there is a difference between people coming here reading, get some parts together and than link that in a thread and ask if that would work and people who come here, say guys I want to build a board, I have no idea what i‘m doing, sent me links to all parts I need.

Kind of but not really. For example last week there were 3 or 4 threads regarding batteries in the EU. All they would have to do is to search for "Battery EU" and they would get an answer without making a new thread. If there are serious questions I think we should all answer but if I see questions like "What motor mount" "What battery" and so on I think it's unnecessary to answer those since the only thing you would have to do is to search for motor mount cheap/reliable.

I really disagree with you here. Discourse has a great search feature. The filter abilities it has are decent, and its not too slow either.... 

What more would you want?

E: to be totally fair, the "your query is too short" or whatever is stupid as hell. Sometimes the search term really is a 2 or 3 letter word.... 🤷

I always assumed the way it works is that as people move up the skill and knowledge ladder they answer more complex questions.  Ideally people who just finished their first builds would field newbie questions while people who are experts can gloss over them and go on to answer the more complex questions.

That way everyone learns and everyone contributes.  And nobody has to get frustrated.

This is typically what happens and its a good practice, but for some reason a large portion of the people that have finished a build or two don't have a lot of patience with n00bs.  I honestly don't know where it's coming from but it hasn't always been that way.  

I mean it has and it hasn't.  There's always a couple of people that are impatient but thee seems to be more lately.

I get what you're saying here but when someone doesn't take 10 minutes to read the intro threads or even learn the names of common components before they ask questions they will get hostility from the people who did. 

Diy spirit, help and advice are different to lazy spoon feeding. There's a trend in our most helpful users on the forum, they've all blown up a board or lost a limb for esk8. Learning all along the way.

this whole board kind of has a reputation of being hostile to new people - i've been told more than many times from newbs they don't like to participate because they find it somewhat toxic in here.

yes...it's a hassle answering the same old questions but if we just respond to all simple questions with "use the search button," it's not really fostering growth or welcoming new people.

having said that, yea...will these hubs work with this ebay esc...if someone asks that one more time...beat down time.

I get that but without the new users posting simple questions this forum will just become a place to bitch or post pretty pictures. It is still important to refrain from brow beating the new users without giving advice. If you want to beat them up for not searching I think maybe giving a little advice at the same time would be good etiquette.

As long as you don’t come up all two month with a great thread like this this forum will not become silent 😂

And there is always tech talk....the difference is which kind of....

Without to hit you personally, but how much noob questions you answer every day in an open thread? Not so much I think. So you more the silent one. That’s ok...but if everybody is silent this forum....I think you can guess the rest of this sentence...

Also this thread is a bit overdone I think. I agree that we should welcome new members, but nothing bad in telling that research helps a lot for understanding. 

They way how some of us communicate that might be just not the right.

I dont know about 10 hours, but the reading requirement is so short and simple to get around its honestly the worst. I think a minimum of 4 reading hours, 50 threads visited and 10 replies would be good.

Its sort of like analyzing data, one data point / requirement isnt going to cut it :thinking:

One thing I want to mention here as well.
There are some people coming from social media where they got answered all there noon questions and after that they come here and ask all the same again. If people who took the time to explain all that before read everything from the same person I can fully understand that they get mad and just suggest to use the search function. Not saying it’s always like this, but we had this cases as well. So, yeah it also very much depends. It also depends how newbies take the advice they get from people here. Some ask for help and than just ignore all the suggestions and come to the same result like before which is just an endless circle...

Sometimes a basic question being asked leads to a nice summary of information that is otherwise scattered through several threads, everyone is a noob at something and getting the first handle on a subject can be hard.

I think we need to keep an updated "extreme budget build" list handy in a thread of its own, similar to the heavily-linked post by @mmaner

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/noob-question-thread-ask-your-questions-here/9559/1344?u=b264

That way we can direct folks to a thread

A hallmark feature of that would be **a list of parts** in the **first post** that helps n00bs

And with old timers selecting the parts list, the n00bs would at least be building the *best* cheap esk8 possible.

Instead of ending up with HTD3M belts or 260Kv motors or hub motors or something else that will hamstring them later.

Heres how it worked for me.
I upgraded an old fiik lead acid thing that the kids had and it turned out ok but left me wanting.  I then ghosted this place for a year before joining.  Read everything I possibly could to learn how to improve the board.  I then bought 2 pre builts and reverse engineered them to learn more.  Then i built a board from what I had learned, all without a single question because I had read and researched.  Watched every LHB you tube video I could find too.  The information is at your finger tips but it depends on how much effort you are willing to put in and thats what frustrates most people.
I genuinely enjoy helping people out, I do but I will not spoon feed you if you haven't done the research or used the proper channels ie; the noob thread.  As @Skunk said its silly to open new threads for every question and that can be handled by teaching, not just build skills but forum etiquette.  I usually try to find a helpful thread thats on topic and then direct them to the search function by explaining how I found the information.
It was more of a learning curve for me to use the forum correctly than it was to piece together a build to be honest.

There has been tons of new noob threads lately but I think members should be more gentle with the "search button" suggestions and general memeing of the thread. Of course their questions might be answerable with a few minutes of looking but you don't have to insult them, just point 'em in the right direction and a slap on the wrist for being lazy. Don't spoon feed them the answers though.

I myself have asked simple questions that could have been answered through the search function only to realize I could find it after an hour of looking. Not that I quite knew what I was looking for at the time though which can make it hard, especially if you're new to this. 

I guess I'm just trying to say; be easier on them. There's a lot to learn and being nice will make this a better place. There will still be potatoes who just want to potato though.

It's one of those "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime" thing.

If you got the time, start by nudging them towards the search feature, then answer a bit or more of their question. It's like giving them a fish so they don't die, then teach them to fish. There's someone here that always acts l33t and just tells people to search. That's basically giving them a fishing rod in the middle of a desert like an a$$hole

On another real note, when is Discourse going to come out with the ability for someone to generate a thread, where the replys (all, or only NON OP ) all have to follow a common format 

E.g: If I made a thread about entry level noob builds and configurations, and I want the replys to follow a format of 

Deck

trucks

wheels

motor

battery

esc

Then I should be able to enforce that :man_shrugging:

I think new users should be given like two free threads when they sign up so they can ask whatever they want. Hopefully, they will use them wisely. To earn more new thread privileges, they would need to spend X number of days on the site or X number of hours reading, etc., until they've reached some threshold where they're considered vetted noobs or normal members.

I agree with this 100% - We should be patient with new users when they ask basic questions, even those that could be answered with a simple search. There's no need to bombard a new member with negativity if they are coming to the group with an earnest desire to learn. 

None of us regular members are responsible for answering every question that comes onto the forum - if you don't like the question you can ignore it.

Dont forget to flatten them after they puff up for the best results.

I think the most fair way to combat these threads is to ignore them unless they are put in a reasonable format for build list components. I keep several links to good threads bookmarked just to throw towards people who need extra guidance and not just a yes or no: should I buy this. I don't like throwing the search function at them unless it's a really bad case of ignorance.

If it seems like you've done even a mild amount of research, I'd be happy to help.

My coming to this forum was delightfully pleasant. I asked many stupid questions. Even after being here a long time, the is diy right for you thread was very insightful for proper terminology.
