Hey Ya'll!!! I have missed you!!

I was mad active for a couple of months, then got distracted with finding a new job. Got myself a nice new life out here in San Francisco! Woo!!!

I am most excited to start coming back to the forums on the regular and being an active part of this community. I love you all. I have 2 board waiting to be built, and a couple of trails i wanna bomb and get some video of. I cant wait to share!!!

Welcome back! This place seems to be getting more and more active by the day. Lots of new posts and topics for you to catch up on, if you were so inclined. Good to hear there's another member in the bay area. If I ever get a chance to get down to the city, we will have to put together a group ride with the other local members. Just for fun, check out @evoheyax's latest build. Pretty impressive, and you might see him around town along with @hummie, @torqueboards and probably a few others I'm forgetting. :thumbsup:

Hey man. I think there's more than a few Bay Area peeps on here @hummie @jinra to name a couple. They'll know best, but you're probably going to need a dualy setup with those wicked inclines up there! Currently at lake Shasta myself for LDW. I'm thinking all these paths around the lake should be some good riding  best of luck to you on your new gig!

Bruh!!!! I will be looking for you as well. I always chase down anybody on an eboard. Like a stalker, or rapist who just found his new victim. So if you see me and my shark face rolling at you, fret not!!!

heres a link to my build thread, but freehand is rolling on white wheels nowadays!

I have been at work an extra two hours today. 

Stricly using that 2 hours extra as "un-budgeted money" means after taxes I get enough cash to buy a new VESC to replace the one i fucked with in a bad way. WWWWOOOOOOO

but holy crap i have not been checking the forums... AGAIN!!!!
