This forum is great.

The one fault I find in it though, is how shadowed posts become when talking about vendors. Yea a lot of you are great, but there's a lot of bs that comes along, the community just kind of sweeps these events under the rug and closes posts, instead of holding these companies to standards of business, y'all hold people accountable to standards of individuals. And the cycles continue. There is not a single esk8 vendor I've dealt with that holds their business accountable. I won't bother listing all the shit I've personally witnessed from my local crew dealing with vendors. But hiding, closing, and deleting posts, and not having a vendor review category on the forum, in my opinion is allowing these businesses to not be held accountable as businesses. Especially when its the same thing over and over again, and the posts get closed and hidden. We're just allowing people to spend their hard earned money, on shit known to fail, because the community thinks removing vendor posts keeps the forums clean.

No, this is diy, we should be forcing out the bad by calling it out, and building a better community, that will be building better esk8s. Because an informed community is a better one. 

Aside from that, I mostly enjoy the forum.

This is a valid concern. Oddly enough the ones enforcing this, like myself and @treenutter and @pschotiller and several others are also business owners. On one hand, foil hattery would suggest that we're all in cahoots and this is all just a hamster wheel we placed in our mall for you to think you're free while you are in fact trapped among our products. therefor, close up the vendor bashing threads it makes us all look bad because...

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/f/cf192955e06cda852fadf133a54ec2f6bfaa2dfc.jpg" width="690" height="459">

... we're pretending to just be regular people but our disguises are too thin!



No. This isn't fucking AOL or CompuServe. 

The hoofbeats are in fact from horses, not zebras. (pronounced zeh-brah, apparently!) there is a much, much less sinister reason for this and it is... drum roll... 

WE DON'T WANT TO FUCKING READ IT. My god man, the threads never end. Yes we know @torquboards has weird customer service people, we know @onloop will have a late shipment and may tell you to fuck off, we know @chaka is behind on that one build for that one guy oh no and we all know it takes me fucking forever to finish a complete and sometimes its really hard to get hold of me. 

THAT'S NOT WHY PEOPLE COME HERE. NOBODY OUTSIDE GIVES A FLYING FUCK ABOUT IT.  THEY COME HERE TO LEARN. 

This isn't the motherfucking daytime vendor drama club, bitches! People come here to learn about stuff. Somebody just now posted THIS AWESOME thread about the love in this room. How the fuck we gonna have love in this room with all that hating over there next to the water fountain?

No. Fuck no. 

In everything, balance must be achieved. No hate means no hate. Love means love. IF you have an issue and wish to respectfully warn people about it, that's fine. Do so and we'll let you know pretty quick if it crosses our well established and obviously patterned lines. We work WITH people to post these kinds of things. Because everything needs to be a positive in some way. It is in fact a positive thing to warn people about swindlers. But it needs to be done so respectfully. 

but you can't have a culture of positivity and learning and hope and love when people are bitching all the time. You like being in the room when your parents fight? Hell no, me neither. 

And i hate bitching. I hate drama. every time i find myself in it, i escalate it until everyone else hates it too and it finally ends. I fucking hate it. Like right now, i'm seemingly meandering on into a rabbit hole of irony regarding my hatred for bitching. I am, in fact, bitching about bitching. You see that shit? LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO.

I get it. We shouldn't harp on negativity.

But the new guys shouldn't have to spend 2600 on torque boards vescs  and the entire crews vescs(26 of them) fail within 3 days to a month.

Or torque boards continuing to sell bs antispark that fail on first plugin and say you turned it on wrong(there's one fucking button)

The new guy shouldn't have to buy cheap ass motors from JLABs just to have the bearings be shot and the bell set screws come loose and strip the shaft in the first day of riding and the vendor not offer replacement.

Or getting a focbox with a manufacturing defect, such as c27 touching the housing because it wasn't soldered on flush and the cap explodes on first plugin since its shorted against the housing. And enertion says send a video showing the settings, but the thing doesn't even boot since the DRV fried on plugin, and you purchased a 1 year no questions asked warranty. And a video of it not turning on is apparently not good enough with pictures.

I get it, the post a out x vendor taking their time gets old. But when vendors claim their shit is the best then don't stand behind it and we sweep it under the rug with a locked post, the next guy ends up with hundreds in paper weights, and we just let them waste money on shit bound to break. And the cycle continues...

As I said the forum is mostly good. But we really should be holding vendors accountable as businesses not as people. I get it were all friendly on the forum. But I earned my money, I need a good reason to give it to you. And I certainly don't want to encourage or support promotion of products by ignorance, which is basically what we're doing. Locked posts dont even show up in search. We ship it all to Neverland

There was sooooo much discussion about this within the mods. Every point you raised was weighed. I myself, a fan of darwin and letting the beaten exit on their own, even saw the light eventually. 

when it was all said and done, we decided to get firm with vendor bashing and make sure it didn't take away from the rest of the forum. 

Thankfully the new guys have no idea how bad it was. Every other thread was "where's my order" and "that guy's a jerk" and "holy shit i just got refunded and told to fuck off" 

You see, the truth is we're terrible people. 

Maybe we should have a section off to the side for it. Maybe that should be reconsidered. But then the issue will move from "we don't have a place for it" to "oh look how neatly they shove our concerns to the side". 

I'm game for re-debating it if the rest of the mods think its worth it. Just know that we don't make these decisions lightly and that we've been here since the beginning. like the literal beginning. Jason invited us here to start this thing up right and we've watched everything since that time. These types of decisions are based on those things we watched and learned from.

@Deckoz in case you hadn't seen it, below is the guideline we mods all agreed on. There's a difference between design or product observations, and complaints about a single order.

I have to make this argument every few months, nothing new here. We close threads that are related to a single order or JUST HOW MAD someone is about the speed of their order, return, or refund. The rationale is in the post below.

People get really upset when they've paid money and don't get what they expect, we all understand that. But the drama doesn't serve anyone. 

Feedback about products is 100% welcome and always will be. Even if it is criticism. **Especially** if it is criticism. Did a product fail? Write about it! We all want to see that.

There's such a range of ages on here now though some kids dont know any better,but saying that there's a lot of adults in this world that act as morons too,the only time I would open a thread up about a vendor would be for not receiving a product or felt I was being treated unfairly or being blatantly lied to,all after actually trying to work it out behind the scenes of course! I think it's safe to say most people are honest and probably give a accurate time of turn around and shipping,patients is something iv gained with age but some just don't aquire better characteristics and stay the same and it shows in there childish posts bashing vendors,but not all of us are listening to them,it's quite clear what some people's motives are,my advice to people waiting on products is to weigh up how much you actually want it and is it worth the wait and just be prepared to be patient should it take longer! Vendors are people just like me and you and have lives to live as well as a business to run,so respect them and they will respect you and at the end of the day your problem will get resolved!

Just a thought but...

Instead of making a post dedicated to complaining about an order or vendor why don't you just make a build thread for your board.
Then if there are any updates with your build progress you can update the post.
Updates can be anything from new wheels, motor, paint, etc.. to blown out bearing trying to break a speed record or even a delay cause items aren't arriving on time so you haven't been able to complete your awesome ride.

We're all builders here and we love to help and see different build ideas.

If you're having a set back because of a particular issue we can usually provide suggestions to dealing with it.
As well as the issue will remain visible for other people too see and notice trends.

@Deckoz we had a truly BS "vendor" here a few months ago. Without going into specifics or naming names, that vendor was quickly and readily shoved out of the community and off of the forum. The forum and its members created an environment where that person couldn't continue. We look out for each other.

Not my forum, relative new comer...not sure if my comments have any value :stuck_out_tongue:

Noticed that this forum attracts allot of people who are unfamiliar with ESK8 tech. Some of them are considering building their own board without even having any prior experience riding a longboard or mountain board. They come across certain vendors spamming this forum in a strategic manner (posting products multiple times, posting ''specials'' several times, etc.) without any repercussions. Those vendors also tend to hide certain specifications on the items they offer and obviously, none of the downsides of their mass production designs are listed/mentioned (discharge rates, BMS specifications, lack of replacement parts, etc.). 

High exposure, low prices results in lots of newcomers asking about these products. I tend to see the same questions on ''eBay ESCs'' and cheap Li-Ion packs, horridly designed motor mounts, etc. 

Those actually selling good products and offering excellent post sales support do not nearly get the attention they deserve. They don't spam the forum, nor excessively highlight their products. Some of them get rightfully deserved referrals when people ask for advice, but that is about it. 

Would be good if there is a better balance there. Single threads for vendors, excessive posting of ''Black Friday'' deals etc. could maybe be removed. Is there for example really a need to list the entire inventory of a shop here one day/post at a time?

Would also be nice if people could list recommended components and list downsides of certain brands without getting into trouble (Maytech VESC is bashed beyond any reasonable point, but discussing design issues of certain other products is at times considered problematic).

Typical shipping times of vendors is also something that I find valuable.
For example, waiting for about a week for a replacement VESC from the same country as opposed to 1 day from Italy (more than 1000km away, props to skating.eu) is something I would have loved to know about :grin:

I'm not sure why this was split but since it was

-build threads. Meh cool and all. But not for me.
-issues are typically on failed products that shouldn't be for sale due to failure vs success rates

Ie: 
TB VESC - out of 26 of them, 100% failure rate
TB antispark - out of the 11, 100% failure within 1-2 on/off cycles
Kaly and BKBs original motors(same manufacturer) had under sized shaft set screws, bell spins on shaft.
Focboxes - not all are created equal(97% of them are just fine lol)

I'm not here to argue about whether a someone's order took to long or shipping,or even refunds. I'm saying these vendors should act like businesses. Sell a defective product, not offer a replacement, and ignoring your customers isn't how companies grow.

Its your business. Own it along with all of its downfalls... Oh wait that might mean more money out of your pocket vs lining it with the stones you sold to a poor smuck. But that poor smuck wasn't trying to be your beta tester....or maybe he was. 

I don't care for the drama either, but watching people buy the same shit over and over, and it failing, and customer services stop responding or ignoring. Then someone brings it to light here, the thread gets opened, everyone except the purchaser supports the vendor, thread gets closed. Off to never land it goes. More then likely won't get a replacement or refund unless you use AMEX or Paypal like a champ. And then the next person falls into the same hole, because all the information of failures lives in Neverland, an unsearchable place. And the cycle continues. 

Sometimes if your lucky the vendors fix the issues for future batches via design changes. But more then likely your still stuck with that one shitty broken thing that didn't work from the start. 

Do I have setbacks? Sure. Do I have any vendors to complain about their semi half thought out engineering? Personally, not anymore, as I've been building everything myself with the exception of motors, the wood plank and the truck. So the only one at fault can be me. But not everyone has this ability or tools. 

and yet there is censorship...what the post is about...

I'm still working on a new ESC still in testing phases but hopefully this should be the last testing phase! I want absolutely zero issues what so ever besides you breaking it with a hammer! :) It will be an on-going effort to make the ESC better each iteration. I'll probably do a test beta run sometime in a few months so for those that seriously have tremendous DRV issues. Please PM me as I'd like some hardcore testing done. I have a few people in mind but the more the merrier. This would not be a free testing product :).

I think it is one of the coolest aspects of this forum, having so many founders, vendors, innovators reading and posting here among us mortals! 
They get the most direct feedback possible and can keep everyone in the loop about what is going on in their supply, development, specials etc. Also they are the ones that know their products the best and can give good advice or resolve problems, when they feel like it.

What really impresses me is also, how peacefully they usually coexist, without trying to badmouth competition, get more attention than the other etc etc. Even during black friday, the advertising posts were extremely modest and definitely far more informative than annoying. When I found out that this forum is owned by Jason, the enertion boss, I could not believe, how fairly criticism is handled here.

Esk8 parts being produced/sold professionally and in large quantities is a fairly new thing as I understand. This means that a certain level of human chaos should definitely be allowed regarding the shops because there is no one brand that has been in the game for 20 years and should have perfected everything by now. You are right saying that we should not be beta testers but we are still early adopters and that is where shit sometimes still tends to happen. Be grateful that we don't all have to work with lame rc parts like the pre 2013s builders!

I don't think there are many setups, where customers and vendors have such a tight connection than in the Esk8 community and in this forum. As I said, it is a privilege, to have the vendors here and It is so easy to contact them for personal issues. This and their patience should not be abused by creating flame threads because something did not go as planned and you are trying to get their attention. You can flame banggood as much as you like  but I doubt the owner will give 2 shts about your issue.

Also I think most of the vendors are in the game because they love skating and not because they are getting crazy rich while screwing over poor customers on purpose.
You said tb vescs arent the best quality and cant handle foc? Faulty Enertion Focboxes exist? Anybody who has read 3 threads in here knows that so I don't think there is crazy censorship going on. 
I know I am new here but I still wanted to give my 2 cents on this topic and the overwhelmingly positive experience I had on this forum so far. Mods, please keep deleting uninformative hateposts by people that take themselves too seriously!

tl;dr
Thanks vendors for not being normal ecommerce CEOs!

doubtful its user error, we've all been building drones and working with these types of hobbies for years. When it happens mixed between BLDC, Hybrid,and FOC... who all really knows, other then none of us run them anymore. Shit my 4 are still sitting in a plastic bag on the shelf dead. Environmental?

already handled. Thanks - we all run focbox's currently, and only one of us had an issue, and it was on first power on and the cap next to the drv exploded. assuming it was touching the casing as there is was a welding/shorting pit on the heatsink where the cap was. But lol when you send pics and video of the drv blown on pin 29 with the c27 cap exploded and support says, send us a screen shot of your settings...yet it doesn't power on lol...




Also this thread is pretty pointless now anyway. The whole point of it was to contrast what was happening in the other thread. Now it just looks like a bitching thread that didn't start as part of another thread, which wasn't my intention. It was to contrast the good of the forum, with the bs that gets locked into neverland...and no one learns. Ugh. And here I am, I get to be the one that looks like the asshat complaining..just like every other OP in every other bitchin thread. 

All the vendors even came out to play.... except BKB aka JLabs.. the guy that doesn't offer replacement motors, says he'll replace them and then ships you back disassembled motors with broken TAPs in the shaft set screw holes..because he thinks its more economical to try to "fix" then then replace or refund his busted bullshit. 

Think i'll just stick to this thread... its better when no one talks lol

I will give my take as a person who was a moderately early adopter of ESK8 stuff back in 2015 and as someone who never had time to give back to this forum and community. 

I KNOW that the small amount of communication I had with people selling stuff here was *INVALUABLE*.  People need to know that YOU have to do your own research and place your expectations accordingly. I did this and I still shitted $200 down the toilet. I know people who lost way more money on this rather expensive hobby and I think that 99 percent of the sellers here were open and honest about what they were selling and how you could communicate with them. You cant expect Boosted boards TM level of service and communication when you are paying less than 50% of the price. Harsh as this response may be, except for the price gouging some sellers may have done in the past, (no names mentioned COUGH $300 Abec Wheels COUGH $120 for 6355 motors COUGH) the service and transparency has been above my expectations on this relatively small forum. I mean before the spammers. 

I still promise to post my build and pictures.

Blah blah blah.... everybody be talking too much just back from the Thanksgiving and it was too much talking.

One word... implicit or explicit....REVIEWS!!!!!

Amazon, Ebay and the rest of the shizzle is all based on happiness factor of reviews... "Oh there was a problem and he fixed it right away".  The hardest working guys on here I have dealt with like @Nowind, @longhairedboy, and others... level of happiness. Are other people using their stuff and well?  Are you the one not? Are you missing a piece of information that prevented that? Talk to the vendor.

Everything else is grandstanding... talk to the vendor, talk to the vendor, read builds, read builds, see who people like the most. The world at the end of the day and amongst esk8 nerds see who and how many are happy with whom.

This takes analysis... and if you can't analyze... don't consume.

FACT: Depending on how prolific you are and your learning level... you will most likely make $500-$1000 a year in mistakes on your lets say first 2-3 builds... after that you will gain vision. I think that is just the nature of DIY.  After that it's gonna be smoother sailing and your ability to assimilate how the components and vendor components really work together.

You could always just buy a boosted or evolve or whatever and then go fight with just that one vendor...those companies have crazy markup and can deal with you better.  There is reason those build in box guys give you a stable but under-powered product that is meant to last and already fits together... because replacing a defective unit is easy for them.

This and their patience should not be abused by creating flame threads because something did not go as planned and you are trying to get their attention
[/quote]


First off. I didn't create the thread. The thread got split from another thread about "all that is great". Don't worry I don't need their attention. I know whom I will and won't give my money to, for what and what not. Our large local esk8 community found this out together by having lots of different builds, with random similarities of parts. 

I do not need their attention. Take the above posts or leave them. I could care less. If you had a big esk8 group local to you, would you trust all you've seen with your buddies and parts failing in front of you, or people on the internet. Hey I shared. Your choice to listen. Just like a mod's choice to silence topics like these..

You said tb vescs arent the best quality and cant handle foc?
[/quote]

No I'm saying they can't handle anything - at least that's my point of view and I'll stick to it, as again big local crew, we all ran TBVESC's...in under 2 months, none of us run TB Vescs, because they all failed, in every which mode. FOC, BLDC, Hybrid. They failed, plain and simple. Every last one.

You cant expect Boosted boards TM level of service and communication when you are paying less than 50% of the price.

less then 50%...that can't be right... seeing as most builds cost just as much as a boosted if not more if they're dual and you don't want crap range..

You could always just buy a boosted or evolve or whatever and then go fight with just that one vendor.

Who wants to do that? If you build things you build things. Who buys shit when you've diy all your life? Not this guy.
I don't have any fights with any vendors...I just have past experiences... I wasn't even trying to bring them up again.

I was just trying to voice my damn opinion about how fucked up I think the close thread and move on thing is in the other thread talking about everything great about the forum. Then it got split into this...and that wasn't even the point...

the point was @longhairedboy  is getting really good at making Tin foil hats, and soon they will be lit with programmable LEDS.......

Yo my friend step back from the ledge. We all have bad times with parts.

Okay how about this... if you can't work it out and you were smart enough to do PayPal... do a chargeback to their account with dispute and file photos/videos of your claim. Wouldn't that protect your dinero $$$ to some extent if not your time and investment of said mastery in all things because of vendor issues? Won't the vendor just give you back your money as you threaten such an action?

I mean I have almost never used this except in the case of truly missing package for months but even then we worked it out.

Also, why did you order 26 VESC's from one guy smarty pants...lol ?

Lol btw.... I am not even a vendor... look what I had to do with a recent transaction ( I don't even know what to say next)....I just had to share this shit for laughs... names redacted to protect everyone's identity...

TB VESC - out of 26 of them, 100% failure rate

That's what I read.  I wish I was 10 years old... we didn't have electric anything back then :frowning:

Maybe way further down there was some parenthetical contextual explanation of the 26? Yeah yeah I read about 2600 and crews and new guys... got it now... but still...

 It's one of those TLDR situations of crying on the internet. 

Still the point being why not threaten chargeback to PayPal or credit card?  Most credit cards protect your chargeback status for months and months and if you show them proof they will take your side. The vendor almost always caves... because it's often better to lose a little money and replace the part or simply do a refund and not deal with that buyer if the product was legit.

Here's a crazy idea. This is an esk8 builders forum, about building boards and stuff. Why doesn't someone start an esk8 vendors forum? A forum for vendor reviews and posts about vendors and dealing with vendor complaints and such? It can be the go to place to get information on which vendors are best quality, easiest with refunds, etc. I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate that?

I got you and you may be in the right... but we are talking about 26 bad vesc's right? That's not a single jerk user situation... lol... that is entering the class action lawsuit status. I mean @torqueboards should be sent back the Vescs and maybe they show it works or dude should go the chargeback / file suit route. Again he should send them back and they should show proof that it wasn't vendor defective or something. It doesn't need to be out in the open on the forum BUT 26 is a large number per say

Dude its done its over. I dont care..

My point was I would rather warn someone of the TWO things you should never get from TB among the other fabulous stuff there. 

Its like me saying should I goto the cafeteria to get a coffee but your buddy suggests a great latte place. Instead of ending in disappointment, ya end up happy you spent your money. 

Read the originating topic, read my very first post. Read all the posts. I truely do not care about a refund or replacement any longer. My point was to not hide the bad. If a specific thing is known to fail, and vendors keep selling it. What good is any community for? To share knowledge. 

You act as if this is the only hobby or profession or whatever you wanna call it where people that do a specific thing don't talk about the parts that don't live up? How do you think most industries run? By identifying failures. How do you get better? Well in larger scale, you stop using a vendor, and use a competitors alternative. Report why their part isn't up to standard for your project. This either ends in recalls or a new model with improvements. 

TB could use higher quality caps and most likely solve alot of failure issues. But that would increase cost. 

Again its not specific to one vendor, that's just the biggest number you see up there, and yet its only about two specific parts. I digress...

You wanna know why I don't care about replacement or refund?
Because after the first 4 (3boards) failed, I contacted Johnny as DIY help chat didn't do anything for us. By the time I heard back from johnny and was going to ship, another 5 boards had failed. With nothing but a "you didn't buy a warranty" from diy and now half of us down a few guys decided to sell their broken vescs and we started looking for an alternative, the focbox. Within a week, the other 8 boards died. Most of us chopped it up to a loss and we all went in on focboxes. One of them failed on plugin due to the c27 cap touching the housing.

Anyway I'll say it for the umpteenth time. Knowledge broski and tinfoil hats now with lazer beams by @longhairedboy and covered in skittlez by @psychotiller

PS I'll say it again. Its about the parts man..the parts. I can't even hate on @torqueboards the rest of his stuff is gold..I always point new locals there because of high availability on most things..but I'll say the same to them...Just no ESC or antispark. Shit we even did a Black Friday buy.

@Deckoz - I appreciate you being open regardless if it's bad press for me or not. How you guys burned out 26 collectively is beyond me.. but I do agree that it shouldn't be like that and trust me I feel bad too. We have tons of people running our VESCs it's weird you guys have managed to kill 26. I'll get in contact with you and we'll work something out with the new ones on our first beta batch.

But it won't be in vain. I appreciate everyone who supports DIY and we have a ton of stuff in the works and ultimately I want to offer higher quality products with low to no failure rate. I've got a new EE on the team as well. If you haven't already noticed we've since stopped offering on/off switches but that as well as a new ESC is in the works.

I'll reach out to you once it's done. .. Pains me. :cry:

P.S. Your local group must be the DRV Killas.

This thread was never intended to amass to this or even be split from the other.  So sorry if it seems all on you. It certainly isn't.

If there is a new esc, I'm sure one of us will eventually try it. As it is extremely convenient to be able to order a lot of things from one place.

I want to be very clear here, a majority f the failure of the DO IT YOURSELF community, has been finding a good source of ESCs. Everything else is mostly being able to combine your legos together and glue them together. You have and had a flourishing market with ready made brushless motors and machined aluminium parts that were all made for this incredibly specialized hobby and you managed to fuck it up. Now this may not be exactly true to everything, but it is true for a lot more people regarding VESC's which I assume is a gripe of many here. You must expect to either take losses or purchase from vendors with credible history. That has so far only been @chaka and @torqueboards 12S TB ESC (not VESC). Maybe the FOCBOX,

I am quite new here, as you can all see, and this forum is amazing. I have met people from right down the road (@Sender  and @mmaner) who are awesome guys and have been a tremendous help with getting my first build rolling. Experience is the most valuable currency in this hobby, and when you're fresh you have none. When you don't have it, it costs you money and time. When you're a college student, you don't have tons of either lol. And this forum helps with that more than anything else Could!

That said; I responded to a post on here about focbox order numbers where everyone was comparing numbers to see who would get theirs in soon. I stated in a respectful, neutral manner that I had been waiting on mine for two months and was order xxxxx. @Namasaki then edited my post and told me it was so I wouldn't get "flagged". This was my second day on this forum, after sending a decent sum of money to a company I didn't know anything about in a hobby I didn't know anything about and trying to get some info on what was happening on a forum I didn't know anything about. I responded to @Namasaki saying that I was not trying to vendor bash in the first place, but that I just probably wouldn't buy enertion stuff anymore. I didn't say anything bad about anyone, I just wanted information and @Namasaki edited my post and closed the thread. No explanation, nothing. That's not okay. That's a great way to harm the hobby and piss people off. That's something that needs to be fixed here. Also, the way @onloop responded to the community about orders on the thread that was basically a shit slinging contest ultimately sealed me not wanting his product. It's all about interpersonal relationships, and I think these two I mention here need to try to fix the issues they have caused. 

P.S. @longhairedboy is a helpful ass dude too, as is most everyone here. I've now bought parts from a lot of you and y'all are great, keep rocking!

That's what I'm saying. When you are completely new here you don't want your speech to get silenced, you need and want help and answers. Waiting two months on an order with their "support team" assuring you it will ship in "two weeks" every week will make you NOT want to pursue this hobby. I'm more stubborn than most, so I just emailed a lot, but it's a turn off. Instead of focusing on your way too inflexible guidelines, maybe asking a couple questions and learning about the problem could help. Ya know, when you see that someone is new, and obviously not trying to bash anyone, they might just want a little info instead of being unnecessarily censored. Yes, you posted a brief explanation that did not apply. There was no bashing, so it's not an explanation.

Hey mate, sorry you have had a bad experience on this forum, the reason talking about orders on this forum is against the rules is because the discussions that occur are rarely positive. In general, it always ends up a big mess of unhappy people, waiting sucks & nobody ever likes it, so people tend to get very angry..

the esk8 industry has basically been plagued with order delay after order delay since I can remember, its basically because the industry is growing quicker than what vendors can scale. most vendors struggle to keep enough stock to meet demand. Even hobbyking runs out of gear for months on end.

regarding enertion orders, specifically focbox, we literally sold 3 months worth of product in just 3 days.. very unexpected and we were not well prepared, we fired our project management team over the debacle. Combined with China shutting down for a month & a whole bunch of other legal matters that nobody on here really cares about.... and basically, the result is very long delays.

sometime in March, we will be back up to speed and have many of our fulfillment issues resolved.

if you feel offended by my comments I'm also sorry about that, sometimes i have days that i am extra frustrated and take it out on people who don't deserve it.

if you don't want to wait any longer & would prefer a refund that's cool too. just use our 24/7 chat on the enertionboards.com website

Thank you for taking the time to talk, I really appreciate it! Yeah I watched your FB lives to try to gather info where I could... I went the refund route after seeing that discussion in the other thread, but the fact that you came and explained everything and gave an apology shows what kinda dude you are. This is the kinda thing that will probably have me running focboxes, because your products are outstanding, and when you have the persona to back it up it's awesome. Thanks again for the comment, honestly after that the only thing I could offer would be to have the support team trying to hand out accurate info, but I definitely can see where that's difficult, especially with the Black Friday/Cyber Monday ordeal. You'll be getting some orders from me after displaying this kinda class, thanks!

See, you just don't get it. Look at what @onloop just did. He took the time out of his day to give an explanation AND an apology for some things he could control, and some he couldn't. This is a guy who is in the front of the esk8 world and he just did that. That's cool. You, on the other hand, refuse to acknowledge that there might have been another path, and you should think about that. That's my problem with you. It doesn't have to be that way.

Your the one who doesn't get it.
I was trying to help you avoid getting flagged.
And as for closing the thread, I was just doing my job as a moderator.

Onloop owns Enertion so he is the only one who could give you the answer you where looking for.

That said; I responded to a post on here about focbox order numbers where everyone was comparing numbers to see who would get theirs in soon. I stated in a respectful, neutral manner that I had been waiting on mine for two months and was order xxxxx. @Namasaki then edited my post and told me it was so I wouldn’t get “flagged”. This was my second day on this forum, after sending a decent sum of money to a company I didn’t know anything about in a hobby I didn’t know anything about and trying to get some info on what was happening on a forum I didn’t know anything about. I responded to @Namasaki saying that I was not trying to vendor bash in the first place, but that I just probably wouldn’t buy enertion stuff anymore. I didn’t say anything bad about anyone, I just wanted information and @Namasaki edited my post and closed the thread. No explanation, nothing.

It's because enertion owns this forum, dude.  They use it for SEO.

Be aware that it only takes 1 person to flag a post for it to be hidden. I have no idea why it hasn't been changed to 3 or even 5.

I don't know man, if this is the route you're going to take I can post just as many things as you can flag. Doing your job as moderator is more than closing threads. If you're a moderator, it generally means you have hours and dollars and experience in this hobby, and ya know what those things help other people with? Learning from what you can share because of your hours, dollars, and experience so that they don't have to learn by wasting their own. That's your job as a moderator.

@eb1925 It's pretty early in your tenure here on the forum dictate what our "job" as moderators is.

We have a clear guideline about vendor interaction threads and posts. If something you wrote got flagged, then a mod reviewed the content and agreed that it (perhaps inadvertently) broke the rule. If you just copy/paste/report the flagged content over and over, it is considered spam and removed. 

We work really hard to make the forum a good place to hang out, it's a lot of work! If a post got flagged and deleted, unless it was some ground-breaking innovation that the world **needs** to see, can you pls just let it go?

Dude I got flagged on another thread for no reason and then continuously got flagged on that thread after calling it out. I just wish it said "Flagged by (sensitive member)" so that way if it only takes one to flag, then that one person gets called out and held accountable for said flagging.

Well there's a good reason it doesn't. It would open flaggers of genuine spam or inappropriate content up to harassment and abuse. It's one of the reasons, for instance, that Stack Overflow doesn't show the names of  voters. It should be anonymous.

I agree with that.

EDIT: Well, it should be multiple flags to hide the post, but even a single flag should still alert moderators.

I'm fine with that. Ideally if a post was flagged and multiple members voted that the flag was unwarranted rotten fruit and vegetables would begin hurling directly at said flaggers face out of their screen like Samara from The Ring...straight through the screen yo

All flags are reviewed by staff and either accepted or rejected. 
If you are referring to the HW6.4 thread, 2 of the 3 flags you received where rejected.

I'm gonna say this since this was my thread.

If your complaining about shipping times
Take it up with the vendor.

If your complaining that you have a partially fulfilled order
Take it up with the vendor.

If you have a faulty product
Take it up with the vendor.

If you have a faulty product and the vendor doesn't do shit.
Charge back or PayPal

In extremes like with my group
We had a couple of faulty products from the same vendor, that the vendor didn't do anything, fail in masses. I came here to warn people of the product because it FAILED IN MASSES. In hopes people would 
1. Stay away from those products
2. but also make people aware that the vendor is otherwise really good. Basically every offering he has is good, except the two products I recommended staying away from due to design flaws.

I wasn't trying to bash vendors specifically. I was trying to bring a SPECIFIC product to light with failures so the Community as a whole could be aware.

Vendor bashing isnt tolerated on the forum because we don't know everyone's personal interactions. As well from my examples above there are proper ways to deal with bad interactions with vendors. 

When I came here to bash the PRODUCT I didn't bring up all the order numbers to the vendor, because we as a group(locally) we're over it and moved on to a better product. We chalked it up to a learning loss.  And I simply wanted people informed about a PRODUCT. 

In the end the lesson is simple. You fucked up and blaming it elsewhere, you didnt fuck up and communicate with the vendor and they solve it, you didn't fuck up the vendor doesn't respond and you charge back. Or and only if you know for a fact that a product sucks because it fails in masses, do you come here and warn people, with valid reasons(not my one part died, but 25+ of the same item died).


Honestly if you don't have valid reasons to back a failed part in masses, you just need to communicate with the vendor. As the forum isn't the place for it.
