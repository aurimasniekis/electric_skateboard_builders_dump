Hello,

After this new Discourse 1.9 and new chat plugin version, but there are many bugs like then you post to chat you need to refresh. You don't see changes until you reload the page. CSS errors that chat is overlapped and other stuff. Maybe it's possible to downgrade to the older version?

At least the chat is bigger than 6 by 7 pixels in the new version and the enlarge button actually works.

Is it not functioning with mobile devices?
Tried to write a short test but doesnâ€™t apply

I see only the two test messages from onloop.
If I tip and sent I get stuck in the chat and even canâ€™t come back to the main siteðŸ¤”maybe a iPhone problem ðŸ™ˆ

Not just an iPhone problem, on Android my message just has the loading icon spinning and my message is grey.
