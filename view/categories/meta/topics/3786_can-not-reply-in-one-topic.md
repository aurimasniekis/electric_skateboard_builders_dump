You are trust level 2. I believe you have to be trust level 3 to sell things but you should be able to reply to market topics. I have no idea what is going on here.

I've gone ahead and made you a level 3 member.  If that doesn't solve your problem, then @onloop is gonna need to jump in here.

the category "EBOARD MARKET" is restricted to level three users. people need to earn that level, so please don't grant it.


all of the category inside the eboard market can be used at level two.

"eboard market" is a category with it's own rules, needs level 3

"eboard market" also has sub-categories inside it. those sub-cats also have their own rules, most can be posted into with lower levels than the parent category.

the parent category rules don't dictate the subcategory rules.

But you encounter Problems like i did now!

The creator of a thread does not pay Attention and does not select a Sub category.
The admins of the Forum do not pay Attention and does not reorganize the thread.


Then you cannot reply to a public post....
i.e. (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/esk8-parts-for-sale-uk/47535)

Damn that i lost my regular badge for some off time :O
