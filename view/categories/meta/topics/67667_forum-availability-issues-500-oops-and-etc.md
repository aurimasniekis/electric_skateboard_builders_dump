Same, loading HTTP instead of HTTPS seems to fix it sometimes. Just writing this post created a popup "internal server error"

We're looking into it... it was intermittent before and I assumed there was some server maintenance happening or some other unplanned downtime. Pls report back here as we gather more info (Yes I realize you can't reply here if the forum is down lol... I mean after once it's available)

It started happening more often to me so I tried loading another discourse-forum and got the same error. I'm guessing it is a parent software problem?

same here, forum is pretty unstable now but it was completely unusable for me about 10 hours ago. still need to refresh about 2 times per page or try hitting reply a couple of times to get the comment out

Edit:
just needed to retry pasting even this comment :disappointed_relieved:

I was just about to start a new thread about this! Glad i'm not the only one experiencing it (well, also not glad :( riperino)

There's three errors one like @Andy87 is experiencing and another like  @mynamesmatt is getting.

There's a third I've gotten. I'll try and replicate it and update this post with a screenshot.

I have found that attempting to reload the page is far less effective than clicking into the address bar and pressing enter. It's very odd.

Going back a page also seems much more likely to fail. But once you click back it usually works if you refresh through the address bar.

Likewise, I have also found that entering via a google link will work sometimes but "refresh" will likely not...

Can anyone with a VPN try accessing the site from various places around the world? Perhaps there's just one server that's having the issues.

Not necessarily a good thing. If it just slowly goes away then it's likely that we don't know what caused it.

I'll be happy when it stops all together suddenly, that's indicitive of a patch.

I'm just worried this'll come back at a later date.

Probably some other forum on discoursehosting.net has angered a large East Asian country by not removing stuff from the internets... and they were probably getting DoS'd by them, github-style
