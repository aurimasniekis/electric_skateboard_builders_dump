If you are gonna start this, I will hitchhike and skate with my non-motorized 300W human powered foot-pushed beauty to you from the Czech Republic ;)

I was just thinking about how cool it would be to be able to hire even a china clone board on a holiday, I would even modify my destination if there was a eSk8 rental business there :) 

I would make sure to have a lawyer on hand to make sure you have a proper liability waver!

IDK Estonia, but I guess they are not as strict rule followers like Germans ;) 

I really like the idea :) but you would have to buy a lot of low powered skateboards, that can stand ome serious abuse (not chineese clones)...Maybe Yuneecs could work...low speed, nice deck, long range, for a beginner really good choice ;) 

And then few beasts for those who like adrenaline :) 

And A lot of helmets and protective gear for rent too, do not forget those :) 

And some kind of good insurence ;)

Yes i have 2-3 yuneec E-Go s.  I've already rented it through my FB page...
Yes, these skateboards are perhaps the best solution for hire are not fast and quality is reasonable...

I like to have test example for one like this: WOWGO

WOWGO is chineese board...do not expect it to last :/ 

Dont be surprised that you will have high costs from replacing parts like bearings, wheels and after some time even batteries :)
