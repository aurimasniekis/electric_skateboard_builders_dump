I saw this posted on reddit (I have no affiliation with the site). It's a really nice write-up. I'd actually be interested in seeing profiles like this on the prominent builders on this forum. Thought you all would enjoy.

well.. not in Florida... 

Basically it goes like this: mow on saturday, mow on tuesday, mow on thursday. Take a break even though you know its not a good idea and when you get back to Saturday you already have 6 feet of untamed grassy wilderness from which emerges an ecosystem that could potentially swallow you and your family whole. Snakes show up, ferile cats start giving birth, giant fucking birds dive bombing your yard for kittens and snakes, racoons dragging you garbage into the darkness that was once a happy fun time lawn.. well you get the idea. 

but thanks everybody for the kind words. It was a lot of fun giving that interview. We did it via email, and it took a couple of days.

with a 20 year micro fusion reactor, there should be plenty of juice for a lawn attachment for the plasma rifle.

Or we could spray some plasma uranium juice on the grass and it will stay alive, but never grow again.

When are you going to build a ride on lawn mowing "E-Mow" skateboard? Could start a new trend in lawnboarding. :laughing:

That was a fun read. I wonder, what would be the amp draw on the micro fusion reactor?

Do eet! Long grass is very similar to long hair, so this should be right in your wheelhouse. :laughing:

This whole ESk8 thing has me thinking about all the things that can be powered and ridden. I went out wakeboarding last weekend and now I'm toying with the idea of electroskating a kid size wakeboard for science. It looks like it might actually work fairly well too. They are fairly stiff, fairly short in a kid size board, and the rocker shape of the board looks like it would be pretty comfy to stand on and give some good truck mounting angles. I can't wake to try this. Lol

After reading your article, I'm also interested in what you've got going in your music recording "studio". I finally got my electric guitar tuned up, and now I'd like to hook an old Boss Drum machine and guitar effects board to something computer based that I can do some 4 track recording or something. Problem is, I know shit all about the recording side of things. 

But enough derailing. Back on topic. Great interview. Very enjoyable read.

I was slightly disappointed LHB did not produce a photo of himself lighting a cuban cigar with a 100 dollar bill but otherwise great interview.

one day i will be able to afford that, and when i do, i'll invite you to my nation state for cubans and flaming benjamins. 

Then we'll eat shrimp and pineapple off a stripper's belly.

Well, i think a third one of @Nowind Leopards could easily drive the mower thing on his flampa.

oh yes. There's plenty of room for the deck from one of those tiny electric mowers under there. Hell you could even do weed-eater parts instead of the mower deck and mow that way.

that shit made my day man! I'm never going to grow the f* up... It's a way of life :smiley:
