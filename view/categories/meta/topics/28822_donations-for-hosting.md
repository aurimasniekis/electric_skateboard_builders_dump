If I understand correctly, @onloop runs this board and it costs $100+ per month to operate. I'd be happy to donate via patreon or paypal to help, since I know I've gotten value out of this site. Does that interest anyone else? Would this be appreciated and put to good use?

If it's needed I might think about it, but Jason's doin' alright at the moment, I'm sure Enertion can afford to keep it going...

Besides, this is the first place they come to sell their wares and I'm pretty sure they do alright out of us, considering we're a targeted niche audience... ðŸ˜‰

Many people have a standing offer to pay for hosting if @onloop ever decides to dump the site or it's a burden it whatever.  Hell, I'd pay for it out my own pocket to keep it going. But it's a non-issue, there are people that build boards for a living that would be more than happy to take over if it ever is an issue.

He gets free ideas on here so I'm sure he gets more than enough in return for his investment.

I think we've touched on this before...

@onloop has made it clear that this is his baby...

And with that I close this thread
