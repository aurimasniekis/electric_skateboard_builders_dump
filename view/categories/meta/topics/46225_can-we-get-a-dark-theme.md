Since my adopted thread was [hijacked](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/regular-tag-not-visible-solved/46138/82?u=moros) from me...

Can we get a [dark theme](https://meta.discourse.org/t/allow-users-to-select-dark-light-theme/60857) added to the forum?

White is too bright while I read in bed, it burns my eyes from prolonged exposure.

A dark them would be awesome. 

Gotta get the nightlight settings dude. It really helps. ;)

Just looked it up, on my phone it's the blue light filter.
Didn't know it had a schedule timer so I've turned it on.  Should make it better until the dark theme gets setup.

If you really want you could setup esk8.builders in your android host file to go through a dark theme proxy...

That could be a short term option.
But better is the admins could setup the dark theme and everyone can enjoy it on every device and I get to be nominated as the bringer of darkness and get my regular flair changed to be like the cool guys.

I'm on board with this. 

I'm also finding it to have an extremely satisfying ring

This is how it could look.

Plus a Skatan theme to butter up LHB

I didnâ€™t even see your link and went off searching if this could be done. 

Here is the gist, @onloop can allow the user to select a normal and a dark theme. I am definitely for this! 

Jason if you have a spare moment, I think a lot of us would appreciate it if you could add the dark theme, full guide is linked below.

If you are viewing the site in Chrome just add a dark theme extension that affects all pages. You can turn them off or on on a site by site basis. I think the one I used most recently was "Dark Reader"

Would be nice if there was a Forum setting for it though

Good luck in getting extra features, The general chat is still broken after months.

The admins don't seem to care that its broken and don't seem to be making any efforts to fix it :frowning_face:

Man for every damn application out there:

'Dark' theme = Greyish sometimes black UI
'Light' theme = fucking blindingly white screen who's sole purpose is to gouge out your eyes at night and in the daytime

If you're using chrome you can do what I did and download an extension that lets you override the CSS for any website and customise the colours yourself.

I've changed mine to a nice dark greyish theme.

I would like this also, I don't usually check the forum late at night because its too bright. I use my reddit app that has dark setting. ios

Chrome uses can try Dark Reader, https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en

If there's such extension for a phone, I would be all set. :smiley:

I was using this until I noticed it started to cause websites to load incredibly slow. Like 4-5 seconds + slow.  Regards of it I had it enabled or disabled for that site or not.   

For phone though I have Samsungs internet browser on my note 9, and that has a night mode that works awesome.

Right here it doesn't seem to slow anything down and my laptop(10 years old), which I use exclusively for long trips is dealing with it just fine. :slight_smile:

It worked great for me for a few weeks.  Had some issues with some websites having the text blend into the background.  
Then some websites started to take longer to load.  First I though it was just that site being shit.  Then I tried to open that site on chrome and it worked instantly.  
After that I uninstalled dark reader and everything was fast again.

Since I only used it for here, i just deleted it.

I essentially just installed this extension, added only this site to it and here we go. Others I use already support dark mode anyways. :smiley:

Is ist really that much work? Or is it that expensive? I cant understand why there is no native dark mode here in the forum.

Themes for discourse, like themes for any CMS, have to be edited to fit the header logo and color scheme as well as sizing aspects.  Its not a quick and dirty process, takes time and as with everything there are potential issues.

Shouldnt be that big deal... the logos and most of the other stuff is already pngÂ´s with translucent background ect. the rest ist just colored by the theme code...

Anyway, that was just a question. Would be cool if we get this 2019. We ll see!

My Firefox has a default night mode 'extension' built in, unfortunately the borders around each individual post shine pure white ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Anyone have a good Firefox extension?
