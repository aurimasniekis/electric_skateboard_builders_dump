I see different abbreviations on the forum. Is there a list somewhere or is it just a case of pick it up as you go?

The only other one I can think of that could possible be used around here is WTT = want to trade.

KISS - keep it simple stupid. 
RTFM - read the fucking manual.
The first one is sometimes hard to follow. The second seems impossible for some folks.

So fubar, as told by my granddad, he originally heard while in Vietnam. Kind of what they would say when the bombs hit. As with SNAFU. Not saying you're wrong cause I know phrases pop up everywhere from anywhere.

It, and SNAFU, are definitely military, and probably before my time (Vietnam was not before my time)

according to Wikipedia it can be any or all of Repair, Recognition, Reason.

My exposure to it was Foobar was widely used in the early years of the computer industry.  To this day I still name my placeholder variables foo and bar (and my buffers Buffy, but that's another story)
