Right now, it's not possible to insert tables, even using HTML (at least not that I'm aware of).

There seems to be a plugin that allows tables to be inserted into posts, can we please enable this?

Try copying direct from excel, then paste here.

Yup, tried that before.

That generates an image of the table, then below the image an inline print of the table text:

The table image prevents linking, is fixed width, and no copy / paste.

Just a minor nuisance, nitpicking really.

I wanted to write a build log with links to parts in a table grid, to make a bit more interactive.
