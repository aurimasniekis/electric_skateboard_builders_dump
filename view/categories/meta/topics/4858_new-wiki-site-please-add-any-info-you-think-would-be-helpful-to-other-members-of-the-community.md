EDIT: Made the wiki site: http://electric-skateboard-diy.wikia.com/wiki/Electric_Skateboard_DIY_Wikia
------



I forget if this has been talked about before. but with a recent rash of noob posts from people who dont search the fourm, i think we need a wiki where basic info can be posted and we can point people to as a starting point.

Some things that it could cover:
- basic part selection guide
- wiring diagrams
- product reviews (hub motors, different vescs, etc)
- calculators (speed, battery capacity, theoretical range, etc)

Im sure there is more we can put in it, but thats all i can think of right now `:P`

As well. I'm thinking start with essentially a copy of the "New builder? LIST OF KNOWN AND COMMONLY USED PARTS!" topic

I think It would be wise to start adding categories.. 

Examples can be taken from these pages (and others too, of course):

http://reddead.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Dead_Wiki
http://vampirediaries.wikia.com/wiki/The_Vampire_Diaries_Wiki

They have some fancy / more advanced first page. I think someone could make it more visually attractive. I have not messed a lot with these wikia management tools, so perhaps someone with more experience could take a look and make some guidelines on how it should be done :slight_smile:

I think the more categories there will be, the easier it's going to be to add new info without making confusion or duplicated it with other topics/categories, which can happen quite fast, if the page is not added or you don't see it that it already exists..

Just my 2 cents .. :smiley:

Btw - I think someone could unite all 3 ''platforms''. - Post them in one topic or such 

* wiki site
* eboard cost template
* tool for config (?) -  _/someone was working on this but have not heard from him in a while /_
