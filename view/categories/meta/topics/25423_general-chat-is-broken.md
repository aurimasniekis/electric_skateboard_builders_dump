This is a problem in Babble chat along with the issue with the text input on mobile, dev of the plug-in is aware of the issues.  The too many messages one I believe I saw a workaround for but don't recall it off hand.

The mobile issue I believe could be fixed with a css adjustment I was able to get it working with this js in the remote debugging on my phone:

```
document.querySelector('.babble-menu .babble-chat').style.height='80%'
```

Unfortunately doesn't seem to work with JavaScript: in the address bar like it usually would apparently either chrome security or something with the js on the page intercepting url changes... I dunno exactly.
