Hi there.

I thought that it would be great to have a EU market place where people inside the European Union is able to trade / sell / buy. What do you guys think? Please let me know if there's anyone besides me that likes the idea :smile:

Great idea, i just paid an extra 50 bucks for importing my VESC's from the states.
So more stuff inside the EU, the better!

Thanks for all the suggestions! Both webshops seems fairly unproffesional though. It is mainlythe layout of the site I dislike, but that is enough for me to stay away... It is also fairly expensive compaired to US resellers..

esk.de is run by @elkick. He contributes a lot to the esk8 community, 
Maybe if you read some of his posts you get convinced that his work is top notch. :slight_smile:

These guys did me a pulley not long back. If you need something bespoke they seem pretty good.

Do you know at what price do they ship to EU? I think I found what I needed there, so big thanks! I hope that the shipping cost is not way bigger than the item itself..

Sorry, no idea about their shipping. Possibly worth shooting them an email.

Ok got it anyways.. For me it would cost 15gbp to ship, when the 64t pulley costs 13.5gbp.. So I will remember this option, if everything else fails.

Alright ladies and gents.....heres the deal
1. Im american and live in spain
2. i go stateside regularly twice a year at least.
3. i would be happy to sluff e-skate parts back and forth as checked luggage and then ship them out as need- this would help everyone avoid import tax and reduce shipping costs...spain to EU.
4. checked baggage costs money as do parts so i would need payment ( part, US shipping, EU shipping and 5 euros per 75euro of part...NO Batteries) prior to August - items would be mailed out from spain in Sept.
5. Let me know what you need, I may get some extras.

I'm trying to get in touch with the manufacturers of pulleys, belts etc.. To buy in bulk to sell. Would there be a lot of European interest? I would ship them from Europe so the shipping costs will be a lot cheaper (And probably no import taxes)

I'm considering CNC'ing some motor mounts, for the paris trucks and the calibers but with an interchangeable insert. So for the handy people they could make this mount fit every truck. I'll make a CAD drawing and post it and if people would be interested i'd start by making 10 or so and see how it goes. Since I live in europe shipping wouldn't be really expensive

I'd be interested in drive components. 
Pulleys mounts etc. Out of interest have you found a reasonable supplier of Paris trucks?

There is quite a cool longboard shop in my area who i have a good contact with. He might be able to give a good price for bigger orders. But the price will not be a huge diffrence.. I've already contacted a supplier for caliber clones
