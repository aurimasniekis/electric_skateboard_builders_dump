I keep checking for

@scepterr - always helpful! Will you be back on here? 
@sl33py - also very nice and helpful and first guy to help me when I was just starting my build. 
@WSB - those stealth motor mounts and then silence.. 
 @flywithgriff - did you actually abandon esk8ing for e-scooters??
@Sapphirinia - you used to be on here a lot tweaking your builds.. What's up?

And some more..

People come and go then come back again.  Nature of the forum but its a shame when helpful members disappear.  Just hope they haven't abandoned esk8 completely, that would be tragic.

I'm sorry. I am lurking, 

Please don't take this the wrong way, as it is no way towards you @sender. 

I type some replies, and read responses, sometimes I feel like the knowledge I try to share is overlooked, like it doesn't sink in, or that I am just saying it to say it because it's the internet. Becoming less active, and watching the community grow and read my old posts, and some of the current building threads now. 

It's like some of what I shared, sunk in to others - because most of my posts are based on facts, and solid ideas and principals. And it sunk in because people searched and dug for knowledge, and wasn't the post at the top.of the forum that everyone could read and see me trying to shove Info down people's throats.

I am here, I am lurking, I just say alot less, because I have already said the little I have to offer.  Thanks for missing me. :)

One of the reasons I keep spending too much time searching for old posts like - I know I read @Deckoz explaining this shit somewhere... but where was it?!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Thank God for bookmarks. Quite a few to go through though. Maybe I should rename them ; 

"deckoz talking about how different motor max/batt max settings affects your ride.." 

"deckoz explaining how motor max is related to batt max" aso. lol

Hey, I'm alive still. I haven't been doing much with my board because my back has been pretty messed up for a while. I'm trying to get it to heal some and not get any worse if possible. Also, after my power switch stopped working, followed by my vesc frying I was really tired of fixing my board. Figured it was best for now. I still love sneaking a peak at all the boards though.

The addition bonus is he's a community member.  If something isn't right he's there to talk too.

Dishing out $$$ for vesc over and over sucks.  Part of why i just went with focboxes from the git go. Shame they aren't being made anymore.

Hi
I don't really know how to start a thread. But could you guy answer my question. I'm looking to build a single belt drive longboard using a 6384 200kv motor with a flipsky mini vesc. The thing is i live in Australia and li-on batteries are expensive and LiPo batteries are annoying. I have a couple 18v 4 ah Ryobi batteries lying around and i was wondering if they would work if i put 2 in series. I'm concered about the discharge rate though.
```

---
## \#56 Posted by: Saturn_Corp Posted at: 2019-08-15T15:39:59.945Z Reads: 67

```

Lots of people have done batteries with drills. Just takes up a lot of space and might not look the best. Just make sure your battery cutoff and current limit values are set right when you set up your vesc.I think 2 of those in series would be like 10s?

I don't know the cells but you're right. Discharge probably won't be great. Solve that with more drill batteries lol.

[quote="SpeakerKid1, post:55, topic:72115"]

[/quote]

the short answer is it might not work

the long answer is it will if you know what you're doing.

The first question would be are the packs fully identical? Has one been used longer than the other?
how will you monitor the pack voltage etc? how many amps can it handle?

batteries are batteries but have you an answer for those questions?
