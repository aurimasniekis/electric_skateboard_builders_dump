That doesn't mean they aren't riding out that they didn't sell a bunch of stuff to some of your neighbors. You should message some of them

specifically for gay men if i recall correctly. People used to just wear tight clothes and do coke on the bar and make terrible mistakes they regret the next morning but now we have apps.

Hi, I didn't saw any information about the creation of a meetup category. I think this is still a good ideia and an important step to bring togehter the new e-skaters around the world and in each country. Who do we have to "bribe" to create the category? :slight_smile:
