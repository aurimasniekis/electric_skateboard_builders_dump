Seem to remember seeing a how to page about batteries for newbs. What category is it in (not obvious to me - how about a "how to" category @onloop? ) , or can anyone add a link here?

Got loads of questions but want to read first...

Most of this forum is "how to" but I do agree we should have a section made for how to, for everyhing

I second this.

It would be great if there was a category dedicated for pure how-to's and guides. I'm doing a Mad Munkey mod soon and was thinking of doing a step-by-step while doing it.

Most how-to's and guides today are drowned in the middle of other threads and scattered in all categories.
