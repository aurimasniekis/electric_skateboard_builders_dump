Long ago we all found out Jason was viewing our PM's. Many of us started moving our convos off site to counter the invasion our privacy. To our knowledge it was only Jason who was capable of viewing our PMS but some of us have come to find that all admins have the ability and sometimes do view our PM's.

Edit:
Would be great if this was openly shared so new players in the scene would know that PM's can easily be viewed by the owner of this forum. If you want to share sensitive info do it through a more secure method.

I also want to apologize to @treenutter for lumping him into this post, it was not my intention. Word was getting around that moderators could also view messages but that has been cleared up by members with experience in how a forum like this functions. The intent of this post was to open the eyes of some of the newer members/young innovators and to make sure their stoke for designing and eventually marketing something new is not snuffed out.

This isn't even true....? 

I can't speak for Jason's ability to see Pm's. But as a moderator, we can't see anyone PM's. 

At least, not that i'm aware.  

[quote="chaka, post:1, topic:83597"]
What do you have to say for yourself guys? Don’t you think this crosses some moral and legal lines? Some of moderators are also vendors so it is a really big deal if they can view private messages of competetors.

What's with the shaming? The Moderators are doing a community service. No need to bash them..

I was under the impression they can only see the pms if they have been tagged.  Tagging a mod is basically an invite into said pm.

[quote="chaka, post:1, topic:83597"]

[/quote]

This is just untrue, as all would include me and I CANNOT and WOULD NOT.  I cannot speak for any of the other mods, but I find it unlikely that the mods I deal with on a regular basis would do this.

[quote="chaka, post:1, topic:83597"]
Don’t you think this crosses some moral and legal lines?
[/quote]

I agree it crosses a moral boundary, but it absolutely does not cross a legal boundary.  There is no protections of privacy on privately owned internet based communications system.  This includes email and call recordings, for folks that are interested.  Most states use a single party consent law, meaning that as long as one person consents to the the recording or reading of a communication it is legal...at least in the US.  I'm not speaking of the right and wrong of the issue, just its legal standing.

I would advise any vendor to conduct communications outside of the forum if the topic is sales, R&D, development, etc.

1) this is not a democracy - you use the forum with full knowledge that its owner and moderators are the ones running the show


2) This is borderline offensive because as a moderator I work hard and in your interest to make sure that the forum stays a focused and respectful environment. I would think that having run for a few years now free of major legal issues, people would have trust in the leaders to continue doing their job well.

While true, it would be nice if we could be user run and FUNDED.

I fully understand why this is unlikely, but it would be great for the community.

I can fund it.

Edit: 

I imagine our inboxes are filled with half-baked ideas, buys / almost-buys / sorry I can't buy(s), and a hundred esk8 startups that may never be realized - but that's the fun, here.

To even picture Jason, with the financial, personal and professional stress of this latest shipment, could even have the time or interest to look at PMs is really, really hard for me to see.  I've been that CEO with a family.

Listen to @b264 esk8 Industry people should not use PM on any free site, anywhere, for any B2B negotiations, including Facebook.

https://telegram.org is the IM for angel investors in the Bay Area for many, many reasons.  Billions, tbh.  Wickr at Uber?  I'm the one to blame.

Jason must protect his business, folks.  That's how it works, and here, Jason gets all the trends under one roof: his. Very smart use of marketing spend, and I think the R2 Drivetrain contest is a huge step towards _structuring_ this marketing spend.

Yet if you take a moment and just consider all the shit Enertion takes every day, for staying their course on their hubs - there's a few of us here who are executives that I am sure can correlate - seriously, we just don't have the time.

All that being said, the idea to .org the site is a very good one - only because, theoretically, the site can be sold out from underneath us, or turned into a picture book of esk8 builds on Amazon, or any number of things that are wholly outside of our control.

I'd buy the book, tho ;)

If you fund it, Jason can't try to extort vendors.  That's why it will never happen.  :expressionless:

If there is any sort of private message spying it is very poor form for anyone no matter who it is.  It is one thing if it is done by orders from a court but just to do it because you can is ethnically wrong because there is a reason why it is a PM and not in the open public.  I wouldn't want my address out there for anyone to see as that is a private and only should be passed through PM.  I would say if a mod or admin is tagged then that is fine as it is like being invited to the conversation.

There can be far to much sensitive information passed between people on here because this is a world wide forum so it isn't like you can just call up the person to chat because some people are from different countries.

So lets hope that admins are not able to see PM's and if they are they do not do it just because or to spy on any R&D as most here don't have the need to spy but I can definitely see how it could benefit a company to have inside information or to have a big enough budget to fund something that they found out that a single person is doing R&D work on and use the information they learned to beat the originator of the idea to the market and not give them any credit.

[/quote]

Except that we've seen signs that exactly this has happened. 

Keep in mind we're also talking about someone who has publicly been very aggressive with legal threats to others in the industry. On the moral/public perception side it's entirely on him how to address it. He's not actually in the wrong to do this even if I disagree with it personally and have pretty strong principles about reasonable assumptions of privacy. 

To me this is a pretty simple equation. This is a privately owned forum, the admins have access to PMs as they do on a lot of communication software (Slack). I consider this entire site to be public, as should all of you, PM or not. It's not privately protected to your benefit, nothing on the internet is unless you own every aspect.

[quote="briman05, post:95, topic:83597"]
So lets hope that admins are not able to see PM’s
[/quote]

It's already proven that they can.

Regardless, Jason owns the site. As such, he has access to all of the databases where the pms are stored. He can access everything said here if he wants. I remember hummie pushing me to start emailing the details of the motors their instead of on here because the hub motors we were building were competing with his. We were a prime target as we did share a lot of details early on.

Is that why Jason uses a C clip to close his motor also (c-clips were not used on hub motors before hummie did it)?

What other info did he use from these PMs where we talked about the pros and cons of aspects of the design?

We'll never know, and when that topic came up and we realized he is actually snooping PMs, we switched to email.

It's defiantly not moral. And not a surprise to me either. Running a successful business today is simple:

- State you have this insanely long warranty on parts
- Market your products as better than everyone else using BS and border line lies
- Send electronics with old firmware's that need updating to use with the latest tools, and when you upgrade so you can check your electronics work and find they sent broken stuff, well too bad, you voided your wrrenty by updating the firmware (classic catch 22 scam)
- Bash those who criticize you or complain about your product.
- Give insanely low failure rates of said electronics, while complaints keep pouring in
- Make a rule that no one can complain about vendors on the forum, since it's hurting buisness and making the failure rates look really high
- Make sure all of your reviews shown on your site are highly rated and delete bad ones
- Build a forum and get everyone on it so you can spy on your competitors and collect data about your competitors and their customers.
- After you screw enough of your first customers over (and tell them you don't care about them, you'll find new customers), you now have funding to start a more legit business.
- Get tons of publicity
- Sell sell sell
- Tell people things are in stock when they are not
- Sell sell sell

And you'll make it! I learned a lot from this forum of how businesses work today. I'm seeing the same practices in my day job now also, which is a very small business doing interior house work.

I understand people being upset that Jason is looking at private pm, however I think that most people are making a bigger deal out of this than it should be.

I have 2 ways of looking at it if you are sharing ways you do certain stuff and only a few people use it then it can be a benefit to the community.  When I first started on here there was very few people who actually used glass frit.  I know LHB and I were part of very few that talked about it.  Since the glass frit post I have seen alot more people use it and that is great I learned it from someone who used it on his boards as a way to show the different colored wood he used and the natural grain.

However using the spy to basically spy on the competition for your own personal gain and not giving the originator of the idea atleast some credit is wrong and unethical and unmoral.  The sad thing about business today is that everything is so cut throat today that a majority of people will shake your hand and stab you in the back with the other hand.  Just be up front about stuff and steal others ideas and then lie about it and claim them as your own.

walking into this forum and using it to talk business then complaining that the admin saw your business is like walking into a shark tank covered in meat and wondering why you're being eaten. 

I mean how stupid are you. 

don't fucking do business here that you don't want to be everyone's business. 

been having this conversation with people for over 20 years now. You'd think the idea of the internet would finally sink in with people.

While I agree, this all started small, and a lot of people start things with no intention of selling it and then do. So you could talk about things for your own use, but it later become business.

I get the comparison of talking about google projects on facebook. But that's the big leagues. This is small stuff in comparison. I wouldn't expect this in such a small industry and with such small companies.

I share nothing of value. NOTHING. 

yeah i use silicone wires. Yeah, you want to jump your p-groups with wires, not weld them. Yeah, split PPM doesn't use the power lead, just the signal. the list goes on. 

none of that shit is trade secret, none of it matters. There is so much shit i don't tell people. 

Not since Jason named his board the Raptor have i ever told anyone anything of consequence on a forum. 

None of you should either.

Exactly. People assume way too much privacy on the internet. 

Internet privacy started at zilch, zero and hasn't made huge strides since for the vast majority of users. Really only the illusion of privacy has increased.

Unless you are pro-actively taking steps to ensure it, you are best to assume that nothing is ever private on the internet.

People are copying my concave. People like to do cool things with wire channels now. More people are poly/glass gripping their boards then ever and hardly anyone uses a top-side lid. More people are using BMSs and trying to build their own 18650 packs. It's god's work that we do, and every time i see SMD caps stacked 2 or 3 high on a 4.12 variant i think of you.

[quote="chaka, post:1, topic:83597"]
What do you have to say for yourself guys?
[/quote]

@chaka you know you're one of my favorite esk8 dudes but I think this post incited an unnecessary panic for everyone.

The ability to see PMs is something ONLY SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS have access to, and it requires extra steps and is not something that is available directly at login. It requires specific backend action to access a user's account - there isn't a "Read everyone's DM's" button.

Every online discussion platform I've had access to has a way for this to happen - the exception would be platforms with encrypted 1:1 messaging. It should not surprise anyone that it is possible for unencrypted messages they send to people online to potentially be viewed by the administrators of a platform - that's the price of admission for using resources online isn't it? Google uses your gmail account for marketing and intel. FB scans your cookies, we all know this. So don't conduct business transactions or highly sensitive discussions over DM. That's a good rule to follow everywhere online, not just here.

@chaka if you want to call out a specific person for a specific action, as you sorta-did, and you want to do it publicly, go ahead and do that. I agree that any misuse of administrative privilege is alarming and if there is proof of that happening, I think it's fair to make that proof publicly known. Otherwise it just sounds like you're talking trash.

There are two admins of this forum, which as noted, is an implementation of Discourse:
@onloop and myself

I'm an an admin to manage and operate the forum on a daily basis. I do this as a volunteer to help out the community. No one pays me and I don't get anything for it besides the good feeling that I'm helping our community to grow. I'm here to help to maintain balance in all of our interactions and to do some of the boring work that's needed to make our sharing possible. That's one of my donations to the community.

Hopefully I'm not getting lumped in with others that might have misused the ability that admin status affords them.

@treenutter and @longhairedboy you guys are class acts.  Love your contributions and attitudes.   Love the forum.  Thanks for making it what it is.

Don’t stop.

Like many keep saying, it would be great if this were a community run and funded forum.  

It would also be great if I owned the Golden State Warriors... and Google... and Amazon

But these things belong to other people, so do your best to enjoy them for what they are. 

Just because someone contributes to a forum, doesn’t mean that they should be granted ownership of it.  If you don’t like Jason’s forum, setup your own, and maybe I’ll join.  

You don’t have to approve of Jason’s business practices to appreciate that he started this place.

But who I really appreciate, are those who help others in the community, just to help, because they love the community.  

LHB isn’t forum royalty because of his concave.  His reputation is based on thousands of posts helping others...and hundreds insulting psychotillers mom.

Not to mention it's pretty damn clear in the terms of use what they do with your information....
I still don't get why people freaked out about thier info being sold to companies for adds and what have you.

At this point I've just accepted that all these companies will have my information. I don't want to have to heavily restrict the things I'm sharing just because Facebook or Google will have it as well. Some of the things Google does with our data in terms of convenience is great

@Skunk @brenternet
I think you guys are missing the point.

They sell your data pulled from your pms.

they probably implemented some sort of AI BOT to do that for them.

If you used Facebook and are surprised that your private information wasn't private..... you're an idiot.

Wowah seems like someone had a little bit of suppressed rage.

This is a fun little topic to talk about but I think we need not talk about it.

3 full stops and then a message directed to any reader lol. 

If it was a direct reply to my message that would totally be considered vulgar
But it wasn't that's why i said "a little bit of suppressed".

On a new note it would be nice if moderators would do quick checks to see if members have alt accounts, because that is the worse thing on online forums.

You can perceive things however you like.
But if I was being a vulgar dick everyone would know it

And nothing suppressed.
I just think people are stupid who complain about free social media apps and thier "private" information
