Hi

I think it would be great to have a seperat market for EU members since it can be a bit confusing and time consuming to find things for sale located within the EU. Do anyone agree? What do the moderators say?

I'm happy with this idea. I don't think it will stuff anything up.

I'm trying to get in touch with the manufacturers of pulleys, belts etc.. To buy in bulk to sell. Would there be a lot of European interest? I would ship them from Europe so the shipping costs will be a lot cheaper (And probably no import taxes)
