Has anyone else noticed a change in the page layout of this forum on iPad ?
It has suddenly become really tiny, while it used to be well laid out. Perhaps my browser client ID is being misinterpreted ?

Any ideas ?

Looks like the "Official stock alert thread" makes the topic list too wide. The link is too long w/o a space to let it auto-break the line. This brakes the layout a little bit. ...or something similar.

Aha! That's why it's pushed all the way to the side on my MacBook! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4e8a8c871291c582128a34b9c75dca9fc054db3b.png" width="690" height="415">

I was wondering the same thing.. I may go in and shorten the stock update thread and see if that fixes it. 

Or maybe one of the other mods will do it, as I won't have access to my computer until sunday.

@delta_19 I dont think it's fixed, you could shorten the link with BBcode, like:

[ url = http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__36657__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6374_149kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor_US_Warehouse_.html ]Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 6374 149kv[ / url], you will have to remove the spaces I have put in between the [ ]
```
