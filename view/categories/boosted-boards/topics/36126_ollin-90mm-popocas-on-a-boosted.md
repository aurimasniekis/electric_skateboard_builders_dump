The OP says they are a direct fit. No need for extra spacers but you do need to remove the belt cover.

I also put them on my dual belt longboard and they're great so far...basically feel like 90mm kegels...<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/4/b414bb9fe68c516d9192252a8c1c78d07936ff37.jpg" width="500" height="500">

They're also drop in replacements for any of my Kegel based builds. even on a Scarlet with no wells. Got mine in the mail friday and immediately rode my battery dead,  called @chaka while i was still riding around and told him how awesome they were.

Then three hours later his wife made him get off the phone.

Was it 3 hours! No wonder I got the look. Besides, she is the shop manager on on the weekends, surprised I didn't get a write-up. :sweat_smile:

@longhairedboy How do they compare to Flywheels with softer duro ?  How do you like 78a. ?

Don't get me wrong. I like Superflys, and i like 97s. I really like the softer thane. ITs super comfy and the added height gives you a ton of speed. 

But in general i simply prefer 80 - 90mm wheels. I like to feel the road. I'm not trying to eliminate the natural haptic feedback i get from the terrain. It's a necessary input. Do my feet hurt more on 90's? yeah, of course. But i feel more connected with what i'm doing.
