Now they released this amazing backpack I only can think of buying a bunch of enclosure from @Eboosted and build a Boosted so I can use it. I have spare motors, mounts , pulley, 18650, focbox i’m edging right now. Damn hobby, I don’t need more boards.

What do you think about it ? We need obed to come here and talk with us to develop the best backpack designed for esk8, like hi5ber did recently. 

Maybe our speed machines are a great way of transport but never practical if you always have your board with you.

Yeah it’s crazy expensive. 

But i think the only competitors are obed right now and they are built very slow and are even more expensive !

That's the kind of money you spend on a camera bag.. like a Peak Design Everyday Backpack...

To protect thousands of dollars of camera equipment... Not a backpack I'd wear on a skate machine lol. One good fall that bag is done. 

Just my opinion... backpacks aren't for skating... Unless it's just big enough for a charger. And mostly a spine protector

If you go out and ride only. I use my board to ride all around town everyday for my job and right now i carry a 10 kg board and it s a pain in the ass. I do stop n go all the time where i can’t stay on the board. 

So for all of us commuting a lot it makes sense, but a this price this is pretty expensive. Tho i clearly believe that it’s a way for boosted to force peoples with the 200 $ credit to use them. I hope for a decrease in price in the next 6 month when they will release next models.

If I have to carry anything on my longboard or eSk8 I reach for my crumpler messenger bag, backpacks suck in a tuck just like a bike...

Actually is that the first one or the second sleek spine/stow bag... I thought that was the first one, I like the latter.

After adjusting...just undo one rib/abdomens strap and it pops off.

And just because Cobber said it. I agree backpacks suck for tucking. But this thing is great...no high center of gravity or anything. Just a little neck hump that almost acts like a LIAT system neck for the back of the helmet.

wouw 260$ for a bag. jesus dude.

generic board catcher works decent and can be found for 35$+.

Other question, how often and for what would you use that backpack. My problem is, I cannot enter anywhere with that. I am already 196cm tall, with the board sticking out a good 20cm on the video (same with my board catcher) its actually much more inconvenient than just some good old carrying. Doors, trains, low passages become a big nono. What good is a backpack when it is inconvenient. I am actually interested how you use those things in your daily lives.

Seriously always wondered if people use those bags and what for ? Since for me carrying a board for up to an hour is totally fine. I mean 12-14kg is nothing really.

I'm in the same boat...if I gotta carry it ok, if it's for a while I just wheel it like a suitcase and mall grab the fuck out of it, but only cause they're electric and a quarter of my  body weight lol.

Everyone's habits are different. But really the only time I don't carry my board is when I go grocery shopping. I toss it in the bottom of the kart. Otherwise I'll carry my board everywhere else unless like mentioned above for long periods.

Well, simpel. Anyone can call me a pussy while I malgrab. Just when we ride in train later on and i am pushing you over 50 and you release the tuck, remember who you called pussy ;)

Nah, had that "phase" here too. But you know what do you do if the local world champion malgrabs tue shit out of anything?  Call him a,, ehm, genious?  ;)

Actully the only reason why it could be wring is with the old indi trucks. If you had em for long enough and did enough 50/50's and what not. They were super sharp and cut your hans. That about it.

You want my opinion? I don't like it. First problem I see is the lack of a sternum strap. You're going to bear 15lbs + the weight of all your regular EDC gear on just your shoulders?... no thank you.


Problem 2. The shoulder straps are those sagging ones with poorly placed shoulder tensioning straps.
![IMG_3375|281x499](upload://8USI6wQkn4FHLfwTElAA5QPf4Ez.jpg)

By virtue of the design of the straps, the bag hangs really low and away from your shoulders. This makes you lurch forward to accommodate for that offset weight on your lower back. Ideally a backpack should use proper shoulder strap tensioners that let the bag sit as high as possible/close as possible to your shoulders.

Oh, and a 6-month limited warranty for a $260 backpack is a joke in the bag industry....

my crumpler messenger bag has a no questions asked lifetime warranty...
if the zip breaks, they just give me a new one (or anything that requires sewing).

it holds a case of beer and 4 bottles of hard liquor, so it gets a workout

I like my TAD litespeed just fine, but if I had to buy another backpack, especially at this price point, I'd rather just shell out for a Velomacchi.

Thanks for that.. I was actually trying to find a spare... Lol. Thought the blue was discontinued.

Edit nevermind the 30% off does work in the US so the 175€ price -45 VAT€ making it 144€ + shipping is to good to be true... $360US helmet... Bleh id rather just get a Dorado(burnt orange) as a spare or a carbon if I was paying that price :(
