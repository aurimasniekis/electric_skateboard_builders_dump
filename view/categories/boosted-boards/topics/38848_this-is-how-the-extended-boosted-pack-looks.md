Looks like they are still using A123 cells.

Those look like 18650 to me

I think 18650's - Not sure exactly which ones though

Disappointing range, at least for now. Cant believe how patient folks were and they under-delivered, proves how good our boards are. Range results are 6-6.5 miles (9.6-10.5 km) with aggressive riding style.

He rode the board pretty hard though. I think it would have gotten double range if he tried to milk it.

Lol, I had one once upon a time. It was a great  board for 3 miles at a time lol.

Just saying, riding the board as hard as he can doesn't seem like the best way to provide range estimates compared to the original

Iâ€™ve had my Boosted boards just hanging on the wall for a year waiting for that extended range. It a good board to ride for fun but I have no idea how people actually use it as a primary mode of transportation. Iâ€™m never going to waste an hour sitting in a Starbucks just to charge. Unless I was still in college and studied there like I used to I guess

27 cell in the picture
Not sure if it is 9s3p
Wonder which cell are they using

## \#19 Posted by: Fatos Posted at: 2017-11-21T13:51:48.952Z Reads: 140

It is a 10s3p
4 cells at the top 6 at the buttom and thee in a row.
That brings it up to the same voltage with the old pack of 12s1p of a123 cells.

From range looks more like a high current cell, would not surprise me if cell  capacity it 2.6 or 2.5. A123 cells deliver true  2.5 ah while three 18650 lion cells at high load can deliver more than 6.5ah. That accounting for range we have seen on reviews.

The cells are green in the model, but that may mean nothing. I feel like a10S3P 30Q pack would perform better than this, and there are more exotic cells that could reasonably be used at this cell count. 

10S3P should deliver more than 6 miles even under hard riding if they were 30Qs

The raptor delivered 15 miles in the cold at 15mph on LG cells. Cut that almost in half for harder riding and you should get close to 8 miles, not 6. The LGs they were using and the 30Qs they were using delivered approximate performance, most people couldn't tell them apart. Fun speed left me with 10-12 miles on that pack at the time. Granted, Fun has increased its speed since then, but you know how it is. 

That means they could have used better cells and didn't, they just changed from lifepo to liion and called it a day. 

I may have a guy sending me his board to see what i can do with it. Cell replacement may be a solid option on these much like it is on the evolves.

I was assuming more something like vtc5, Samsung 25r or something else in that range.
Im just guessing they wold try to meet the current output of the a123 cells so that the batteries don't get to hot or the board gets slower. 
Again it's just a wild guess.

That's what i meant by not being sure if they were meant to indicate the cell. I can't imagine they would use 25Rs this late in the game and talk about increased range when the 30Q delivers a better curve for less explosive discharge and more range in smaller packs without a hefty price increase over the 25Rs. 

Either cell would work of course if they made adjustments in the ESC to take advantage of the particular cell they used, but i'm just speculating.

how much range would a 30q 10s3p give more or less? I bet more than the 12 miles they advertised right?

it would be more. How much more is the question. This is uncharted territory, my friend. Stay thirsty.
