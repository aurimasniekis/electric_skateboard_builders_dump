Just saw this from Jay Boston about Boosted possibly coming out with multiple versions. 

It looks like Boosted is finally playing catch up to get range in one board and portability in another. That looks like a pretty high riser on the black board.

The battery enclosures on the Shortboard seems.... odd? It looks like a scaled down version of their regular one which is made for the Vanguard deck. Just my first thought :slight_smile: If the brake light feature is true I'm looking forward to it becoming the standard for us DIYers in the future! I know Vedder did it a while back...

and will be interesting the fight between blink acton vs boosted shorboard.

mine just arrived today. I juggled with the idea of selling it, but probably just gonna officially give it to my wife so if it fails on her it's not my fault since I didn't build it !

Yeah but 'extended range' for them means lousy 12 miles!

Yeah totally. I think the extended range battery specs in real life will actually end up having the range advertised for the original battery

Word on the street is it's just a preorder.  So unless they actually start selling something that's in-stock, meh
