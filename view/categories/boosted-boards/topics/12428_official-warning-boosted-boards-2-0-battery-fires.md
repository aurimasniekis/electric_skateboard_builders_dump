They are using 12S1P A123 LiFePO4 packs. By far the highest discharge and the most stable cells available. 

I have my suspicions that their BMS is not doing it's job correctly. The inaccurate battery SOC issues and venting makes me think that the battery are being seriously over discharged or charged. Either that or the batteries/BMS have a manufacturing defect that is shorting the cells in some way.

The new Boosted update is on their blog BTW. https://boostedboards.com/important-battery-information/

Thanks for the info. It sketches me out. My BMS got a little corroded and has been having wonky SOC/charging issues and the pack is much bigger.

I think it's a mixed bag as long as fear doesn't infect the entire industry. As the old saying goes, when there's blood on the streets buy land. I think onloop developing a new BMS was dead smart and if he can instill trust and talk to its safety features he'll be able to capitalize on all the issues and distrust there is with Bestech and other BMS vendors.

My theory

I talked to a V2 owner and got some info on the battery charger. 

They have a charger supplying 50.4v~ now. It used to be 43.2v around. 

The standard battery is using a 12s1p LiFePO4 battery pack. The charge voltage is 43.2v.

If the BMS does not cut the voltage off correctly, the cells will be overcharged and this will lead to damaged cells and venting.
```

Why would they use a higher voltage charger? Is this a fast charging thing?
```

---
## \#55 Posted by: Pantologist Posted at: 2016-11-03T19:25:15.655Z Reads: 215

```
Higher voltage so you can use the same charger for the 12S LiFePO4 battery and the speculated 12s2p Li-ion pack(higher voltage).

To decrease charging time, you usually increase amperage.

Hard to tell...  They charger is outputting 50V now. That is odd for charging a 10S Li-Ion and 12S LiFePO4 pack.

Maybe they switched to 12S configurations.

Lol sorry for going off-roading. This thread is a repost btw - so maybe should close the other thread I posted on here a few days ago since this one seems more popular.

Personally I'm glad @onloop is investing in BMS prototyping - these safety concerns are real, if the diy community can make a safer product than boosted that would be a coup. DIY batteries are also much bigger than boosted. 

@Pantologist mentioned in the other thread that he thinks this is a result of the new higher voltage chargers meant to charge the extended batteries and the BMS.

My friend just got this (his name deleted): 

> Dear ,
> On two separate occasions, a lithium battery cell has vented inside the battery pack of the 2nd generation Boosted board. The battery enclosure is a fire-retardant composite and worked as designed to contain the cell failure. Fortunately, no one was injured and no property was damaged. Our engineering team is conducting a thorough investigation and we will update everyone with the results.

> We have strongly urged all riders with 2nd generation boards to stop riding and stop charging them. In addition, we will stop shipping boards to new riders until we complete our investigation.
> We take battery and rider safety extremely seriously at Boosted. We are working non-stop to diagnose this issue and resolve it for all our riders. We appreciate how incredibly disappointing this is for many of our riders, and we ask that you follow our safety recommendations immediately until we complete our investigation.
> -Sanjay"

I wonder whats happening with their packs. I thought the cells they used were supposedly very stable.

I don't get how a li-ion cell even vents or blows up, unless they are poorly manufactured. I looked at the spec sheet for the LG HE2 cell, and the test results are outstanding. Charged to 3x the max voltage, no fire or explosion, crushed horizontally and vertically, no fire or explosion. They have a list of 15 or so tests and not a single one cause a fire or explosion... So how does a li-ion cell even do this?

I think this means they charged with a current 3 times the normal max charging current. Endvoltage was still 4.2V - not the other way around.

The US Military or something did an over voltage test with A123 cells and after a few charge cycles, the cells failed to hold capacity. They didn't drain the cells though. Probably would starting venting if used.

ohhh, so they charged a cell with a 12v charger to 4.2. That makes sense, but it also says its an over charge test, which is what confused me. The language is not the best either in the description of the test. Either way, they did quite a few tests which resulted in no fires or explosions, which I found to be quite impressive. A lipo under the same tests would not be a pretty result.

no they charged with a 4.2v charger at 12A (4A being the max charge current).

"This short circuit was caused by water entering the pack due to a quality control issue in two areas of the manufacturing process"

So the problem was user riding in wet conditions I assume? I understand that they are advertised to be able to, but personally I would never just because of my OCD natural, it would be hard to clean off after a wet ride

It's great to see how Boosted is on top of their quality control problems and open to the public. Boosted is still advising users to not ride the boards and not to charge it though
