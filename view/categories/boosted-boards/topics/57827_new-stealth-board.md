It is not out yet unless you know people in boosted or certain YouTubers. Also there is no coupon codes for it.

No coupon codes for price discount that I'm aware of. But you can get a code from a Boosted ambassador for a free Thousand helmet

I've been at one of the group rides they organized and I saw the stealth. It was a dummy board and wasn't rideable. They are still working on it and brought it just for show so people can see the board in person. 
Nobody is getting a stealth anytime soon.
