Hey guys. 
I have boosted board 2gen with extended battery. 
Even after firmware update, on boosted app its saying 8 miles range only.. i didnt find anything to fix this est. range of 8 miles only. 
And there is no option to reinstall the firmware also. Anyone had that problem?
Didnt had long ride to check it.. but on the est-range its saying only 8 miles. Not arround 12 miles when i full charged.
