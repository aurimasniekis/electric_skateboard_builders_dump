Where are you located? There's like 2 here in the DC area that I'm eyeing on Craigslist. A V1 and V2..Anyone have any input on what a reasonable price is for a used Dual + V1 (or what you would pay)?

That's probably because I went and bought the V1...sorry man lol :grin:. The V2 disappeared before I even got the V1..they wanted too much for the V2 so you didn't miss anything. There's a guy on the Reddit boosted forum who offered to sell me a V1 for $800..might want to check that out.

This user on the ElectricSkateboarding subreddit is selling this on CL and willing to ship with a BUNCH of extras (3 batteries, 2 regular and 1 extended range): https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/spo/6164182296.html

He "recycled" it at best buy when they recalled the batteries. Then he asked the best buy employee if he could keep it. (source: him (the dude selling it)

BTW extended battery isnt out so basically 2 batteries while you want for 1 to come

He ended up selling the bundle for $1400 IIRC

Isn't it illegal to sell it though? And do you think there is anything you can do with it? (like giving it back to boosted)

It is 100% illegal. Selling recalled products is illegal. The dude at Best buy could probably lose his job over it.

Do you think using it could be dangerous though?

Yes. It was recalled for a reason. Boosted decided that the risk to their customers and chance of lawsuit was greater than the tremendous cost to recall the batteries​and ship new ones out.

I wouldn't ride with one.

I'm sure the cells are perfectly fine, but unless you take them out and make you're own battery pack or fix the sealing issue, they are considered dangerous.

So you can technically just change the BMS while keeping the cells and the enclosure?
