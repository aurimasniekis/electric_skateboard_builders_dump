I feel bad for those who have overpaid for that board. Really looking at it, that board could be build for under $500 USD. I like the idea of integrating stuff into the boards design is great, but I know with the hills I go up and the amount I use my board, that thing wouldn't last me more than a week.

I can't believe how much money these guys have made for what is really an inferior design.

@evoheyax can you elaborate on that ?
What makes for an inferior design ?
I would love to see a bill of materials for an equivalent (in every way) sub $500 board.

lets not forget that these guys are running a business, and they got to make money.
a 100% markup is pretty standard across most items, so if they sell for $1000 expect that it cost $500 to make.

agreed @lowGuido

plus, since they make most of their parts, they get them at cost, or heavily discounted by buying in bulk: so again, it probably costs them half as much for those motors as it would if someone like us were to try to buy them.

What makes it inferior is the small motors and battery. It's useful for short trips, but one is limited in what they can use it for, I.e. Not a commuter board (without still having to take buses).

On the motors, because of the belt pulley system, at least here in San Francisco, you would need to be careful on where you ride it. Having a board myself with a belt pulley system, I constantly get little stones into the belt and gears. This is one reason why I'm moving to the hub motors.


I think a similar but still better built would be:

-Any board with grip ~$50

-carvOn single motor drive (includes wheels, bearings, and trucks) $300

-VESC $120
-zippy 6s 8000mAh -$80

All in all, that's ~$550 and the components are of a higher quality. You can tell by watching the video that the board cannot take any abuse without breaking so my feeling is there's a lot of unhappy people out there whose boards have already kicked the curb.

I have boosted dual+ and a carvon single hub/vesc setup you described. 

I agree that the boosted board is a rip off at full price for what you get but disagree that there are tons of unhappy users.  Check out their reddit page and other social media presence.  I've never seen so many people love a product so much.  Their customer service is superb and the design and curb appeal of the board is excellent.  

My carvon is great but hill climbing and stopping power can't match the boosted.  It is no where near as polished looking.  Single hub also pushes unevenly compared to dual motor, especially at high speed.

I could be wrong, as I'm making assumptions based on the videos and pictures plus little bit of data I've seen. Even if my my $550 build is quite the same, a dual motor carvon plus with 2 x lipos and 2 VESCs would be much better.

- board ~$50
- carvON dual $500
-2 VESC $240
- 2 zippy 6s 8000Mah $160

for $950, cheaper then boosted, you can surely build a board with a much higher top speeds, greater range, and more features.

This is why the "self built eboard movement" phenonomen is going from strength-to-strength worldwide. Dream it, Build it....

Because Performance Matters!

The more we can spread the knowledge, of how to make really good homemade esk8's, the better they become...just over the last year alone the user builds have been mind blowingly-good! .... they are constantly getting better & better. The in-a-box offerings are not really that amazing and are not  really improving. 

What do they have the we don't have? - Sleek hand controllers was the last frontier.

We are out building the big brands from our garages!

I fully support everything enertion does, but the space cell to me is too expensive if the slim form factor is not needed. I use 2x zippy lipos in parallel and I get a 15-20 mile range (depending on the hills). I may in the future use a space cell when I try to build a thinner board.

The point of this build was to show a decent build can be done for a fraction of the price.

My current build is the enertion trucks, wheels, abec bearings, 1x r-spec II motor, 1x enertion mechanical system, and 2x 8000mAh zippy lipos in parallel, and I have a max speed of around 18 mph on flat, 12 mph up step hills (still does the steeper hills though), and a santa cruz cruiser board. Grand total for the build is about $500, maybe a little more. And as I have said before, I get to and from my university (10 miles a day) without many issues. Also, I carved my own enclosure out of wood with a dremel and a belt sander. Cost for the wood and glue is under $20.

I can totally agree on this. While the nunchuck/kama solution is pretty bad ass, that directional stick (while I have yet to try it) does have me slightly worried. It does give some tactile feed back, but its not going to be nearly as strong as the boosted's disc system.

I think you have the wrong idea of how there drive train works. I'm 98kg 10kg less then you and I can climb and hill I have come across, bigger motors mean nothing if your gearing isn't high enough.

The boosted uses a 1:3.5 where a raptor with bigger motors use a 1:2.6 it is a big difference.

I have pulled my boosted apart many times and I am very happy with the over all quality.

From the looks of it, this is the ESC. The big wires go to the motors. Underneath (from this angle, but on top from the top of the board) are the wires that come from the battery pack that sits on the other end of the board. In the video they pointed out those AA looking batteries, but I have no idea if that's what they are, and much less what they're supposed to do. Anyone else?

The circuit board 'stuck' to the batteries I would imagine is the BMS (battery management system), in charge of charging and discharging the batteries. Those 'AA' batteries are not batteries at all, they're capacitors.

I was just looking at those exact lofepo4 cells. 24 of them cost about 200 bucks. They use 50mm motors. The only thing that's special about the boosted as far as I can tell is they dialed in the esc and had some sleek enclosures made. They advertise their enclosure as being able to flex with the deck. In reality that means they used three screws on one side and it actually lifts off the surface of the board when it flexes. That sounds like it would rattle around a lot to me. I was going to buy one but that $1500 is going to make me one hell of a board. 

That loaded setup would run you about $310 so there's that.

As far as I know, the housings don't flex. The middle of the board flexes the most while the edges of the board don't really flex at all. 

Also Boosted only used 12 cells. Not sure if you know that already or not.

They definitely have the most polished board. Their design and research make for a great board. I would have bought one in a flash of I didn't know about the fun of making my own. :grinning:

Love the forum and the backup support u guys have for each other.
Yea boosted cant compare to our builds with speed power and distance....
That said some guys still buy them...here in Sa some guys have a handfull if that much ..but boosted refuse to support us with part...and really upsetting tonthose who paid a fortune expecting the best support...mmm not...
Pls can some kind enought help my customer out with a dual plus v2 battery pack we will pay expensive pls so he can also join us althought its a boosted....
.so sad actualy and u guys will feel the pain with me and him ...his wife bought a boosted for him as present they confiscated it in Germany air port dangerous goods u know...ups then shiped it to Sa at $850 shipment cost only....but remooved the battery...now one is assisting.not boosted..ups is mess etc....will ne much appreciated

I don't have a good understanding of their system but after dismantling my boosted v1 dual+  and playing around with it a little bit, the battery level indicator and power button is built into the bms itself. I'm trying to figure out if the two wire can system must be connected in order for the bms to function like a regular bms or not. But my bms is half way dead and gives me 1 long 3 fast flash so I can't tell you with confidence at this time. Once I get my hands on a functioning boosted bms I'll probably make a post about it, I want to try using the bms with the headway 38120 even though they're bulky and heavy. 
ohh and if anyone has a dead boosted battery with the bms still intact that they're willing to get rid of let me know. Thanks

If you can make an equivalent board for 500 or even 600, please post a parts list because it means that I have wasted a lot of money! @evoheyax

This is just painful...could you imagine if you had one of these tesla batteries (or just a part of one) powering your e-board??!!

Wow for real? Can I send you a PM. I would love to know if there is a way to either fake the BB ESC communication or turn it off so you can run BB batteries on aftermarket DIY boards.

What are you trying to do exactly? Repair a Boosted? I know who designed their BMS/Battery pack.

Hey! Would you be willing to help me contact him? I need help designing something : )

Thanks

Reviving this:

In process of trying to salvage a Boosted v1.   

I found two bad cells and I would like to

* ditch this BMS
* buy a cheap BMS just for charging
* Replaced 2 of the A123 cells
* Discharge directly to ESC

Charging only....

Trying to determine what those 2 small wires HCANL (not the power/ground) are running from the battery back to the ESC.  Anyone have an idea?

Hi i have a (Boosted Board) with a rapid flashing red light which indicates a faulty battery, that refuses to charge. I tried riding the board around for over a hour, trying to boost the battery pack voltage, it didn't work i then decided to open the battery pack tested all of the 12 cells and all where in average 3.10V/3.28V but 2 of them where 2.10V or so volts. I then charged the two lower cells up to 3.25V successfully, tried to charge the pack again and nothing same rapid blinking red light.. I then decided to take a closer look at the board and noticed that there was what looked to be some liquid damage which looked like it burned out the (C33) capacitor! which I have no clue what the value of that cap is so I can replace it, so my question is, can someone Measure there capacitor located at (C33) on the board and let me know the value ?

Lifepo4 Cells in that video are pretty large - larger (fatter) than 18650 from the looks. Are they 26650?

Anyone know if boosted uses the same cells in their extended range packs?

Standard range cells are 12s1p lifepo4 a123 26650 


Xr battery is a 13s2p of liion 18650 cells somewhere in the 2800 capacity range

Source: I’ve open and worked on both

Are you sure it's not the other way around?
LiFePo4 cells have a lower voltage so I would expect  them to be in the 13s configuration.

Yes i'm sure. 

Built an extender pack for my old v2 (can count the cells) 

The yellow cells are from the standard range..

Strange, I did not expect that.
Do they limit the top speed via erpm?

## \#93 Posted by: rsalmon Posted at: 2019-01-25T15:42:52.704Z Reads: 145

```
Since LiFePo4 offer more discharge, they had to increase voltage on the extended Li-Ion pack to achieve the same torque without the feeling of voltage sag at any point of the ride. Actually the torque on the extended is slightly more punchy.

As for the top speed, it's unclear how they implemented it since the ESC is proprietary. ERPM would be a good bet, yes.

I don’t think so, boosted’s drive wheel pulleys are 56 teeth so that is the limiting factor I think

If the standard and the XR battery give the same top speed when they have such a difference in voltage (43.2V vs 54.6V) they must use some sort of speed limiter.

Hey barajabali,

New to the ESK8 game but I'm an engineer with a lot of questions.  I own a Boosted Board V2 Dual + and am looking for ways to extend the range.  Portable Electric Skateboards makes a mod that requires tapping into the positive and negative leads of the board and putting in series additional battery packs.  However in his video it looks like he's using 10s battery packs with the standard range V2.  When the board is completely dead his extended packs still have like 50% left in the batteries I think.  Any reasons for this.  Wouldn't it make more sense to make 12s1p packs in parralel and connect them into the positive and negative terminals so you get the maximum capacity of all the packs?

I may be out of line here but my visceral reaction is not to mess with Boosted HW. Except for @barajabali (you gotta add the @) he's been around the block I'm sure he knows what to do. 

Boosted is like antithetical to DIY but the upside is it just works and when it doesn't it gets serviced on someone else's time.

I’ve bought from portable electric... good dude.

Here’s why he’s using 10s- If you mod the board and tap into the +/- for the normal range battery... it’s running at approx 42v

For the fully charged extended packs, I got 51.2 v. So, I imagine you could run a12 s on the extended range if you mod it and stick to a 10s on the normal range battery. I’ve made my own batteries quite easily and put them onto the board and it’s a nice little boost in range.
