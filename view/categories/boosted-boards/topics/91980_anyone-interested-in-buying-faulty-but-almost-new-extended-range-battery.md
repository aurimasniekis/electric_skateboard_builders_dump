I have a faulty ER boosted board battery. It died on me after 4 or 5 cycles and I had a replacement sent to me from boosted. Anyone would like to buy please let me know

Your profile is missing your country, so I will assume you're shipping from Antarctica ;-P

I will take some photos tomorrow. If you are in europe you don't have to send it back. They ask you to dispose but I havent done it yet as I tought I might keep it as a spare. I am planning to sell my board as well now so will not need it.
