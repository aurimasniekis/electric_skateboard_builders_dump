new boosted board 199wh option, improved torque and kegel wheels!
this is the image you get after processing your preorder.



[Click here to save $100](https://boostedboards.com/?ct-referral-code=rmV11DmU)

After clicking this link or any other referral link don't click any thing but reserve or you will loose the $100 discount.  It will list -$100 I think lots of ppl have not actually been receiving there discount.

I know it is not about DIY but i feel it is important to for members to know all the options that are out there for them to ride!

and the have improved the range and this was the biggest boosted complaint, it also seems they have bigger motors and bigger wheels so torque and top speed might be also there.

What's up with that referral link?
Do you get some money when someone orders with it?
On hypothetical checkout it shows me that I would get 100$ off due to the link - that is quite generous from boosted

Referral link seems very generous, I have pre ordered for now because I think with the $100 offer it is a more reasonable price. Would be good if someone could use my referral link and we could maybe create a chain?

I just rode the old version again last weekend and it maybe does 20 or 23 if I lay down.  Good torque but low speed and awful range.  There are a lot of people who bought these not knowing how much better diy can be.  Unless ur into the convenience of not having to build anything or don't trust yourself to make something reliable....diy!

I thought boosted would possibly be competion in performance...not even close.

First, you have to preorder the board, then they give you a referral link.  For each person who pre-orders the board and keeps it longer than 30 days, they will send you a $100 visa card.

"Two weeks prior to shipping, we will send an email to confirm your address and collect final payment" <-- From boosted, to better answer your question.

Sounds very much like a evolutionary update than anything else. But then again for an off the shelf board miost Boosted owners love them and the range was the big issue. if it can get 12miles thats not to bad. Raptor can still get me 18.6milss or 30km and is faster at doing it.

Never timed it properly. Say 10mins. There are a few screws to remove..Ive swapped for shorter screws and have electric screw driver(see raptor tool kit thread).  25-30km range is a good ride.  Worse case you bring your fast charger and have a coffee somewhere with a power point. Charge up and get to a station or bus service.

Well if that is the case another fully charged space cell and some tools should do it,  and maybe another remote. Ive used 2nd battery,  but not had to charge remote again,  but I know the remote doesnt really give you an indicator of when it will run out.  The remote maybe the only thing that could hold you up for going endlessly. Never tested how long battery lasts on it. In any event 30plus kms is alot of riding.  Your more likley to get tired than the board running out on a 2 battery set up.

You could add the GT2b thats always on the threads for good remotes.  Its only really ugly as its one of those RC ones.  Reliable and you can swap batteries if need be.  Dont think you can just swap between both though.  As you have to change vesc settings.  I can say you should be fine for 40km range on 1 steeve remote charge.  Just not 100%. You dont want to be not have remote not working,  so its all about common sense.  Also if you do have time the remote could be charged.  Next thing on space cell should be a usb port like Boosted 2. Then you could even add a light.  Is it just me,  but has  this whole eboard thing just exploded.  Its definately moving forward. The DIY have known for a long time though. Bring it on its so exciting.

Every one remember even Jason has said this in his comparison videos, the vesc has some way to go to produce the same control and feel as the boosted board, on the boosted there is no question if and wheel the motor will engage and actually spin there is smooth control and no gerky feeling with the remote when throttling as hard as you can then releasing, it is all curved via rpm and a very high res decoder a lot higher then hall sensors.

I f**ed my knee on an esk8 2 years ago and since then can't squat to slide and my kee gives way if I jump off at speed (even after 2 recons)
So for some ppl like me the boosted is the best option until some more options come out for the vesc and better remotes things that Vedder and I am working on.

ive ridden the boosted a couple times and I typically ride two hub motors (80,90,or 100kv) with vescs on  FOC and no sensors.  I find the vescs just as smooth accelerating or braking as the boosted  I was surprised by how quiet the boosted is but its still a toss up and I think the vescs and hub motors are quieter.  I can have smooth operation down to maybe 2 or 3 miles per hour no problem.

If u use the as5047 encoder it will be even smoother on FOC, 2.17 supports this, the boosted uses the as5134 it has a lower resolution then the as5047.
But because the hubs don't have a shaft it's hard to implement but I'm working on it.

Still love my boosted board tho. It's mainly the feel on the deck tho.

It is smooth for sure first time on it where as my board is pretty trigger sensitive.   They use a steeze-like remote which, other than the deadman switch you have to constantly hold down, is really nice.  Think the new evolve has a similar stopping-when-not-on-it tech without requiring the deadman switch.

The deck is nice and smooth and I guess they're doing the same again. Bit high and bouncy for going fast but that doesn't happen on it anyway.

The dead man switch isn't needed but it actually has a freewheel feeling so the board has less resistance when your not holding the switch to help when you just want to push!

But our hubs don't need that do they!

Does anyone think that Boosted are now left behind now that the Evolve GT and likely Bamboo versions are coming out. They have more power, better range. Who needs to swap batteries when you can do 50km and go 40km/hr. Waterproof is good, but riding in rain or wet isnt safe anyway.

It's not just because of Casey. The demographic that boosted board are aiming at are not the same as evolve. You talk to the guys at boosted and they are all about community, so they incurage group rides and sharing your daily ride and the enjoyment of the ride. Before I did my knee I would ride my rayne or kebbek deck for down hill then a loaded deck for my daily until I started to just use my dervish for every thing. It's just because that's how I like to ride.
So when I jump on my boosted I feel at home!

The electric skateboard community is expanding and for me and sorta where I want my YouTube chennel to go is helping ppl find the right electric skateboard for them. Because although performance matters it's not every thing.

I forgot in my post that the price options are alot better than the GT till a Bamboo version comes out. And yes there is that CN factor. But I also think like @jacobbloy  that the Boosted is fundamentally a really fun board to ride and I know the owners love them. If they didnt like it like CN they wouldnt promote it

@Rob.Endless You just have to look at how CN abuses them. I think he has only had a hand full of issue.  I recall it only once not working at all hence the reason why he has more than 1. Other reason is to have other boards so others can join him.

I don't know why comparisons between boosted evolve and DIY (enertion too) devolve into "apple vs pc vs roll your own". 

I have a boosted board because I wanted an electric bike a year ago and stumbled into something relatively cheaper and more agile. I ride the shit out of that board and I love it and depend on it to get to work. Range and deck flex are the only things that could be adjusted IMO. (And top speed, but that goes with out saying). 

will I buy a second gen? Naw, I'll find a fool selling an old board and replace my batteries when the time comes. I've already been rolling on kegels too.

I reserved the Dual + Extended Boosted Board 2.0 and got an email in regards to their progress. It looks like I will be getting the board sooner than expected, but with a regular battery since they are delaying the extended battery. Good news is that I would have a free battery. Pretty cool of them to do this.

This is what they said.


**Extended Range Battery Board: We want you riding as soon as possible, so we have also decided that all extended range Dual+ and Dual reservations will be fulfilled with standard range battery starting in August, along with the extended range battery when they begin production in early 2017 at no additional cost. After you install your extended range battery, You can keep your standard battery as a spare, carry and swap it on longer rides, or use it for airline travel.(we feel it is necessary to invest further engineering time in additional safety features to match the exceptional safety performance of our standard battery. This means shipment of our extended battery will be postponed)**

Is it only me that thinks the new boosted 2 13mile 20km range is a bit of a non event, Just seen their video of someone travelling in fast speed for the 13mils. If they shoot that with DIY, Raptor or Evolve could return half way or all the way in the instance of the Evolve.

Suppose they have to pump up this feature as the 1.0 had pathetic range.

They have to pump it up because some people think the battery doesn't even exist yet lol. I'm betting they probably just got f*** by their battery manufacturer and needed more time to get them made, tested, certified, etc. 

I also think they over estimated a bit with the "early 2017" so that they can end up over-delivering. Just my guess. People would go insane over that. Although I'm sure unless it was like November no one would care about riding in the winter.

Can you over-deliver after you have under-delivered (in terms of timings)....? I guess you can create the perception you have. I get that the small blokes get delayed because they have very little supply-chain power. I can't help but feel that the BB situation has occurred because they deliberately brought forward the V2 pre-order with aggressive (and therefore risky) timelines because of summer 2016 competitive pressures from the Evolve release. They needed to combat market share loss by getting the BB market base to commit earlier.  It probably influenced their better judgement or risk threshold for delays. Anyway, good news for those who want a BB v2 but have an alternative in the meantime, I suppose. Free battery.

I came to the eSk8 late in the game. Currently still riding my small Acton Blink Board that goes 15mph (which is scary on a short board).

I ordered to Boosted 2 because of the soft ride and overall design. Only being able to travel 6 miles (point of no return) sucks. but that's why I'm making my own as well. I'v just got a VESC and deck at this point, still waiting on the rest to be manufactured I guess. Glad I live in California since things probably won't get to me until the sunny winter.

Someone should show BB a thread of @whitepony's vanguard build, so they could see what a DIY version of their board is capable of.  If I was BB, I'd seriously consider licensing and selling the speed control software and remote. That seems to be their only real advantage.

they bounce too much

That, sir, is a **real** benefit! You have less vibration in your feets. This is awesome if the terrain is not awesome :D

It also makes it unstable to go 30+ mph...  Which I suspect is one of the reasons boosted limits their speed in software.

And the real solution to vibrations is not a bouncy board but is 90/97/107mm ABEC wheels. Those things absorb so much vibration that you can ride on road with them.

What makes them better, is that they offer just a polished product with excellent customer service. Regulars love this highlights. The board's sub par performance doesn't matter as much to them.

I'll never understand why people think they need to go more than 30+ mph. That's what riding downhill is for.

I live in LA, and the streets are shit here. The loaded vanguard deck is one of the biggest selling points for me. I can't stand riding over cracks. The vibration is so annoying. I'm using my board to commute. I want my skateboard to have suspension like a car. And a loaded vanguard is the closest thing. I couldn't care less about going 30+ mph.

Plus it does seemed really polished.Especially now that everything is enclosed. I've noticed a lot of the small improvements they made and it really seems like a step in the right direction in regards to what a next generation board should be. The version 2 just started shipping last month, so I'm gonna reserve judgement until more reviews come out.

Yeah, I had my first fall a few days ago at 20mph and it hurts like shit...The ~20mph range is good enough for me. 

I've always wanted to replicate the polished design of Boosted in DIY but boy they have really nailed it down. They took lots of effort to get something to that level of refinement and it is worth it's price despite the specs.

I dont understand why people still complain about the battery... Its like that for a reason :smirk:

They don't limit there speed in software apart from there dual and single. The board is speed limited by increasing torque. It has one of the best gear ratios for efficiency! Also boosted z-board and inboard where all apart of getting the California law changed to make eskate legal and the law basically is around 22mph.

Also the range can be inconvenient but the range is so impressive for a 2.5ah battery.

Iv ridden the v2 and torque is improved as well as I would say increased hill climbing and also a much nicer ride with the 80mm wheels.

They also have some of the most advanced safety cut offs around. Go watch the video where they cut one in half while it's still on. Boosted have same thing like 3 mechanical and 2 software based anti short and cross polarity protection.

I wonder how Boosted is powering these quite [familiar](http://bittblock.com/shop/products/motorized-vehicles/bittblock-custom-200kv-6355-motors-preorder/) looking motors with only one cable. They seem to have connectors with like 12 pins on them. Never seem them before.

From my experience in the manufacturing field of aerospace, just because the connector _has_ 12 pins it does not mean that they are _using_ all 12 pins. For example there may be other characteristics about the connectors of the motors that are desirable for theme.  For example I believe they are meant to allow you to pull the connector out should it get stuck or pinned on something, preventing the cable from putting strain onto the VESC solder joints. Also a lot of small aerospace connectors can handle high amperages and so I wouldn't be surprised if thelse are similar in that regard.  I think also boosted wanted to move towards modular designing so this would easily allow for that as well as make their motors a piece you would most likely have to replace through them resulting in additional sales.  They probably got a good deal buying a shit ton so there's that too. Just a thought though.

They might be using lots of those available pins. The motors are sensored and I don't think they'd use a single pin for each phase. The pins are ridiculously small.

They should be 9 pin 6x sensor and 3x phase wires, each phase wires are payed to 30a maybe a little more and basically they do not need more then with current to drive the motors because if there higer gearing.

There motor stators are also a lot shorter then ones used in most others builds.

It's the same connector that the ego cruiser uses

Hi, I just bought one and I’m a bit annoyed with the range that i get from it. So I was wondering, if I could use an external battery pack to charge it. I’m aware that external battery packs with an ac plug could work with the right size, but they’d loose a lot of energy converting to dc. So, how about if I find lets say a USB to boosted board plug, meaning dc to dc, I wouldn’t loose the energy for the conversion, right? Meaning a 100 watts external battery should be able to recharge my board quite decently...?  Would that work?

Thanks
