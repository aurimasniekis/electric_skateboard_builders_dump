Looks like there is battery level indicator on the pack itself. So maybe it is swappable :thinking:

They have added swappable battery. Nothing to be excited to be honest :)
Actually the battery is not swappable - it is "user replaceable" which means you have to unscrew the cover.

I really hope all the GT reps were wrong and US can get the board soon...Boosted is saying shipping in late July which is a bit too late. An extended pack cost $400 (which you'd want to get because the included is only 8 miles going all out) while offering half the range of a pro 4 space cell that costs the same...lol they will make a lot of money off of this but the range for money spent is a joke and its still the same board with no increased speed... The other additional things they added are pretty nice though.

While I really don't like boosted boards, I have to say they do a great job promoting. That promo video is pretty bad ass looking, great cinematography and if I wasn't a DIY guy, I would be sold by that. Knowing whats in a boosted board though, they give the board the look that is fast and super long range. I would love to put one to my range test, if anyone here in SF is willing to let me take their boosted board for a spin so I can tell the world if their range is even close to accurate (and you could try one of my deadly fast boards.

isn't that the whole point of having that replaceable battery? Put the smaller one in before flights and when you are back home put the big one in again. Casey will probably have 20 batteries just because he can and a 199Wh one stored permanently in a locker in both LAX and SFO.

@Maxid I'm pretty sure he gave those away cause he already had one.

Is it "sponsored content" to NOT endorse other products?
He also already has electric skateboards - so why is it any different?
He can say he is not involved with boosted but that does not have to be true - I like his vlogs very much and he is a fascinating guy but I won't trust every word he says. His first class travels, apartments, parties and life-style needs to be payed somehow - and even if it is not direct payment from boosted he has surely not payed full price for the repairs he needs or forgotten remotes - so he does benefit from giving them exposure (both sides do).

Three choices at this point are:

1) Boosted V2 July-August

2) DIY Board - June-(possibly ready by July)

3) Evolve GT - (potentially) Late Fall

Despite the underwhelming performance upgrade I think I might just go with Boosted for now since it would get here sooner and I know it'll be reliable, and if the Raptor is enough to satisfy me I can sell the Boosted for a lot of money and wait until the GT has been tested to see if its worth the investment. Or sell it and make a bad ass DIY board once Enertion has the pro4 / new enclosure in stock, and someone figures out the ideal set up for dual mounting chaka's new motors.

I guess i don't have as much of a cynical view of him as you do. He seems like a trustworthy person who says what he thinks and doesn't try to deceive people. 

I would imagine he pays for all that with his business, the youtube channel where is daily videos get at least a million views each, all the talks he gives around the world (i would have to assume at least some of them are paid), and his wife probably helps the bills since she also has her own business.

I thought about that, idk, I guess I just want to wait until everyone has more stuff in stock..lot of cool shit being released from this community and I want to see where it goes. I'd only save maybe a month of waiting if I go DIY which would probably be worth it... 

I guess longevity wise I want to have the flexibility of being able to sell whatever I get (easily) for more or the same I paid for it. I'll probably do a DIY build in winter, but take my time with it

@Mr_Mahal Really wish we were ready to take orders on our integrated decks you would enjoy the power and range. Nothing on the market can match the system we have developed. Well over double the range of the leading designs. 

If you are considering purchasing the motors we are stocking please know they are intended as single drive or a dual diagonal drive. Dual diagonal is nice because it distributes the weight evenly over the front and rear trucks. 

Most builders go dual rear because it looks "cool" but it makes for poor handling at speed. Granted most people keep the speed really low so the effect is less apparent but it still has an effect on loose asphalt at low speed. All this talk about performance begins to look a little funny when everyone builds dual rear drives. I suppose the truth will never come out unless we get a honest racing circuit going.
```

## \#34 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-05-19T18:19:32.799Z Reads: 193

How should wiring go for dual diagonal? One VESC in front, one in back, and one looong can-bus cable? or should you extend the motor connectors to reach the back of the board?

I don't like to have either the motor cables or primary power very long. If you have to make the primary power cables longer you can add capacitors to handle the extra length.

From what I hear, things aren't very official or regulated. A lot of agents don't look into it very much, and a lot dont care. I've also heard of success with labeling it as <99wh even though they were higher. I know Jason from Enertion brought two of his SPACE cells on a flight from Hawaii and they didn't even check or care.

If I could do that I would probably go ahead and buy now...alternative is waiting for @torqueboards motors to come back in stock.. Not sure how difficult a dual diagonal set up would be for a first build lol 

Has anyone tried a dual diagonal set up other than the way above??

Hills in my area are in great supply so I have to have dual motors..

You can also try Enertion's motors if you don't mind unsensored. The spreadsheet I linked you two yesterday has a pretty base guideline build for exactly what you're suggesting. You'll have to use torqueboards v3 mount unless you want to wait a month for his v4 50mm adapter.

Well that was a disappointment. I'm not exactly expecting a complete overhaul of their deck but their selling point is basically "more range!" It's more of a BB 1.5 rather than second gen.

@Mr_Mahal & @Photorph I got a reply from @EnertionSupport and they said they're just waiting for vesc and should be able to ship all outstanding orders in 2-3 weeks. Not that Enertion's track record have been good, but I'm inclined to believe they'll be able to make it for this estimation. Or you can just build a temporary diy, that diagonal drive system looks awesome.

True.

& whaaaa?? ALL outstanding orders? How many are there left... I was telling @photorph that all they needed was the VESC shipment but I didn't know realistically how soon they could actually put it together when they got them. If they're shipping by end of June I'll just wait but still pre order carbon whenever its available... DIY board during the winter to destroy them all : p

Ya, thats what @EnertionSupport told me. Obviously we shouldn't hold them firm to that date range because shitty things happen. But if everything goes well, Im expecting they'll be able to ship all orders in 2-3 weeks. So take it as a ball park.

I'm actually going to commission someone to build an AT board for me in the not too distant future. I don't have the time or patient to build a DIY and I doubt I can solely rely on Raptor for my winter or rainy day rides, so I'll just commission one of the peeps from this forum to help build me one. That or I'll wait and see what Enertion plans is with their AT hub motor, I would really love ride that board in the snow, it'd be so awesome.

The real reason everyone builds dual rear is because it looks cool. And because onloop shouted so loud about it because thats how he built his. (While openly admitting that he has actually never tried diagonal )

I have done it.  Its great.  There is no uneven pull with braking. 
If anyone wants to tell you different make sure they have actual proof otherwise its all bullshit.

Weird since one of onloop's videos on his youtube channel recommends dual diag for heavier riders who want to climb steel hills. Though, it's an older [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eakga9Bzj9E).

How did you wire your diag configuration? did you have very long battery cables? Did you put one VESC in the front and one in the back and connect them with a very long can bus cable, or did you have both in the front/back?

Way more range on the Ollinboard Flux

I can easily nurse 40+ miles on mine but mostly stop below 30 miles.

Sure any board can say max range but if the owner takes the batteries that far then that is why you read reports of battery packs needing to be replaced.

Big whoop the new BB range is around 15 miles but probably only a good idea to go 10 or 12 miles per charge.

Dual VESC can be similar but you'd have a can bus cable connecting them and you probably dont want it exposed under there so you might want to get a custom hard case for it unless you throw the whole setup into an enclosure.

I highly doubt this is the case, there are individuals from February who are still waiting on their orders to ship.  If "ALL"  orders are to be shipped in the next 2 to 3 weeks, then at least all the people from February should have had their orders shipped.  Mine had a shipping estimate of late April.  After so many delays I kind of just stopped waiting, but I will be thrilled if it gets shipped in the next week or two.

They are getting stuff though.. Just in bits and pieces lol. But really it depends on how many orders he *still* has from March and April. People could be dropping orders with all these announcements -- though that'd technically be stupid seeing the potential shipping dates for BB and Evolve.

I think if he gets the VESC shipment within the next 2 weeks he can probably get everything out from march april may by end of July. He has already got the wheels. Not sure on the battery progress though and if he's upgrading our batteries to pro4, doubt it.

And the battery isn't available til the end of the year... hahaha 
They've essentially just hyped and released pre-order for what is basically the same board as they already have, just with Kegels.
Pretty disappointed to see no big changes. The range is still pretty poor and that's after you have to wait for the new battery, no performance increase, no new deck. from me - no new interest. still other boards i'd go for.

@Mr_Mahal shipping is looking like late june, so should expect delivery july

Enertion seem to always be well behind on supply. He keeps saying boards will be straight out the door, but there always seems to be something that holds it up. I know people on here have said they ordered in february and still waiting. guessing if you order now you may be in for a bit of a wait,

I ordered early early May, as soon as I could following the selling of my BB... so hopefully I'm not too far out. I'm thinking he may have lost some orders potentially which could speed things up so who knows

They told me today pro4s should ship in a week or two. Not sure about VESCs or raptors though.

IIts because he love those boards. Hes got 4 of them. 3.1mill followers and has been the face of BB wothout their sponsorship. He is now their adviser. So assume now gets free stuff to review.

I just reserved my board so stoked!  Went with the standard battery to make sure I can get it faster and to bring it on airplanes and what not.
