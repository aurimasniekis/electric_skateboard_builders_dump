Honestly not trying to sound too negative but if she would have fallen and got all scrapped up it would be a better video. No pads no helmet, no respect. ,! Helmets and pads are not a gimmick they work. Trying to look cool isn't that cool!

I got bored before I finished the video. Cruising at jogging speed isn't very interesting. Chaka's high speed videos are much better.
