Hey there. I finally finished my own board (will post soon) but in the process i changed my mind a few times. So i have some spare parts to sell now. I wanted to build a Foosted first so i have built a 10s4p Samsung 30Q battery inspired by electricpacks. I gotta say that i did learn a lot in the process but Building a battery is not easy.

Anyway here is my creation. All the P Groups are isolated with sticky fish-paper and all the series Connections reinforced with double strips. 100% pure Nickel strips (i tested them). Spot-Welded with the Boss-Welder. All the Balance-lead Connectors are isolated with Kapton Tape and FishPaper underneath them. Charge-only BMS. Discharged and charged about 5 times to test if all is good and it worked perfectly. I bought the cells from NKON  so they are legit. Can throw in some XT60 & 90s and or a few Cables and isolating Material if needed. I can also solder some connectors or Adapters or an Anti-Spark if you would like to. I also sell all the Little parts for a few bucks too. You can see the measurements in the pictures.

EU-Only shipping with UPS or DHL Express. I will cover the shipping cost.

If you have any other questions or wishes just pm me. I am also thinking about building more batteries for $ or Bitcoin. So if there is demand for it let me know.
