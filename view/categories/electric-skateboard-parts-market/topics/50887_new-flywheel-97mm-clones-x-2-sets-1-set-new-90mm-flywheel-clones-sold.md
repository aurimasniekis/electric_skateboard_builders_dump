New €20 for 97mm (have been mounted with a pulley for board layup) with bearing and spacers

Edit 90mm - gone
Edit: used 97mm - gone

All have new 608RS bearings, not bones or zealous but not crap

Trying to make €100 for uneeded parts, upgradium disease

Perfect for cheap/starter/friend build, they are not crap they are just not as good as real ABEC.

If you live in city confines or areas with good roads in general on these you're good in general

Following with pics but not necessary it seems!

Last new set up for sale ![IMG_8801|666x500](upload://pA4uutqpafRHuUYTbUGjH4eX0re.JPG)

These are provisionally sold to @bullrider12, if he decides elsewise then they go back up.

Shipping with no tracking came to €13 as the package will weigh ~1.5kg,
I would of course be able to provide a copy of the shipping receipt from the national post office. 

Registered/tracked/insured was about €23-€27. Almost impossible to damage in transit for obvious reasons
