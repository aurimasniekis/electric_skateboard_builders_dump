Read the rules and while I could not find anything stating this would not be allowed, if it isn't please close/delete my thread.

I have $662 USD in amazon.com credit that I have received over the last year or so, however i'm in Australia and I was intending to use this credit for my e-board build but have since realised very little ships from amazon USA to australia :confused:

I was thinking of purchasing items on behalf of you (not exactly sure how this would work) for 20% of the price (so 80% of price), or swap for e-board parts (vesc, motor mounts, wheels, controller, etc).

I'm happy to provide proof that the gift card balance has been on my account for ages and that I do indeed own the account :slight_smile:

Again, if it isn't allowed, feel free to close, wish more e-board parts were on amazon :frowning:

Isn't there an Australian Amazon?   https://www.amazon.com.au/

Edit:  Never mind.  All they have is kindle stuff.

Had a look but it adds so much to the price it's not even worth it.
