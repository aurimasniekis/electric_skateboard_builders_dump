Hey all!

As some of you may or may not know, I've been making custom batteries for a while, however, I've never made a thread advertising my services till now!

Here's some pictures of previous batteries I've built (some of the previous batteries I've built had crossed balance wires, but this has since been corrected).

All cells are sourced from a very reputible US vendor called Liion Wholesale and are tested to be genuine grade A cells!

All packs use: saltwater tested pure nickle strip (the nickle strip also has rounded corners), insulation rings on the positive terminal and have ample fishpaper and kapton tape where needed. All packs come standard with a xt60 connector for discharge and a 5.5x2.5 or 5.5x2.1 (buyer chooses) jack for chargeing. Other connectors are availible upon request. 

The standard bms included is a charge only Daly electronics waterproof bms, but other bms's such as bestech are availible as an upgrade (see prices below). Packs do not include a charger, but chargers are also availible upon request.

Standard turn around time is approximately 2-4 weeks as I order the bms from China and need to wait for it to arrive. If you need a battery quicker, please pm me and I may be able to work something out.

Here are my current prices ( prices do not include shipping and are subject to change at anytime).

Why would you want fuses on the cells?

Some may want it for extra battery protection. But I like most don't build my batteries with cell level fusing.
