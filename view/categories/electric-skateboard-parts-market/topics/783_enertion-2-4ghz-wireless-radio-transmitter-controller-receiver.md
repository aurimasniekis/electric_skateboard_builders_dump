I do... I like the gt2b/badwolf look a lot better. The cruise control is nice though...

@onloop does the receiver have more than 1 channel? 

The reason I ask is because I was planning to use a reciever based headlight/taillight system on my next build, and It requires 2 extra channels.

@onloop How does the cruise function? If you reach a desired speed and click it to hold that speed what happens if you fall? I personally like that the c button on a nun chuck, when released,  your throttle zeros out. Is there a dead man's function on this new remote?

I received an Enertion remote, to see how it fairs compared to my Nyko Kama.
Unfortunately it didn't seem to come with any schematic of any kind, in true DIY style.

Some questions:
It has two sets of PWM pins, are these both the same channel ?
Which pin power (red wire), which one is ground (black wire) and which one is control (orange wire) ?
Does it need separate power supply or does it get supply from the VESC ?

What about button functions ?
I assume C is the cruise button, what about the two front buttons ?

How do you bind the tx with the rx ?

What about charge indicators ?
Is there any warning the battery is low ?
Does it indicate when the battery is fully charged ?
```

```
Ok, so I've managed to answer some of my own questions:

Both sets of PWM pins are the same channel so you can split your signal over two controllers.
The polarity of the pins is marked on the PCB, GND is the pin furthest from the NRF24L01 module. 
RX is powered via the VESC.    

C-button/thumbstick is the cruise button: press to hold current speed, it doesn't seem to allow speed adjustments while cruise is engaged, like on the Nyko Kama.
A-button is the power button, press for 5 seconds to turn transmitter on -> green LED
B-button: brake function, same as pulling back on thumbstick.

Binding seems to be automatic/pre-bound. If no connection between RX/TX -> red LED on RX blinks slow and left LED on TX is green. Upon connection -> red LED on RX blinkss fast and left LED on TX turns red. 

Charging: LED next to charge port is red.
Charged: LED next to charge port turns green.

Don't throw out the charge cable, the male mini USB plug has a non-standard length because the receptacle is mounted deep in the housing. Other mini USB-plugs won't reach in far enough.

haha, that cost extra! I am glad you got it worked out, fairly straight forward.

HOT TIP: If you have dual vesc you should use CAN-BUS to connect them and connect the RX to master VESC, splitting the signal from the RX works but it seems to get a weird interference/pulse of signal from the 2nd VESC which results in a random twitch.

@trbt555 thanks for all of this info! Subjectively, how do you like the feel of it? Is it worth replacing the nunchuk with this? At this point, I have 2 nunchuks, GT2B, and TB's mini 2.4!

Yes @lowGuido that makes me sadface too! Especially since I upgraded the firmware of my VESC and the nunchuck cruise is working so smoothly compared to the previous version I had.  It's not very steezy, but maybe one just gets used to it.

I've been way too busy at work to go out riding so I can't comment yet.
But I like the shape of the controller.
Could be a bit heftier though, I might open it up and hot glue some weight into it.

EDIT: I also like the fact it's rechargeable with no removable parts.
If you ever have to bail when using a Nyko Kama, good luck finding your battery compartment cover and your batteries.

Ok so I got to test the Enertion controller today.
I had a dual VESC CAN bus master/slave setup, connected the reciever to the master, made all appropriate settings, used a bench supply limited to 2A and apparently blew up my DRV chip anyway, started getting FAULT_CODE_DRV8302.
@chaka, this is one of your high output VESCS, hadn't been run on the road yet, please advise.
Coincidence ? I don' know. I'm getting tired of VESC's dying on me, the DRV8302 seems to be the VESC equivalent of a wonky head gasket on older French cars. Mr. Vedder should do some reliability engineering IMO.

Anyway, I managed to get the transmitter/receiver combo working on the remaining VESC. The only setting that seems to work acceptably is "Current no reverse with brake". 
It has a very different throttle-feel than the nunchuck, more agressive acceleration, not as gradual as the nunchuck.
Didn't really enjoy it. 
Also, don't really know how to trim the signal, because it was constantly braking when I backed off the throttle.
Do I adjust the pulse width settings to achieve neutral ?
Put back the nunchuck. May use it for a second build using all the spares I've amassed the last few months.

Very Intersting, I have never tried this function, so I assume if you set the soft rpm limit end to 60K ERPM does this mean that once this erpm is reached it cannot go any faster? What actually happens in the real world?

in a normal RATPOR setup for example.
36v 
15t motor pulley
36t wheel pulley
83mm wheel
190kv motor 14 pole

MAX rpm is about 6800 (95k erpm) which is around 28mph

So with a 60K soft rpm limit to speed should max at around 17mph

But does this actually have any effect on the initial ramp up? It sounds like it just is at the end.

Nowdays chip are not as fragile as it's used to be against ESD. I have the feeling that burst current / spark / sudden changes in voltage / amps cause DRV to fail. I had your VESC just new (maiden voyage) being run for 7 minutes and it never goes back on after one of my XT60 cable goes unplugged due to vibration. The VESC was wrapped inside anti static plastic and then wrapped again with bubble wrap.

Maybe you should test one of your VESC by riding underload half throttle and then suddenly cut off power, see if it gets faulty.

---

I've read it somewhere that Vedder are aware of this weakness in the DRV chip. He recommend to use higher voltage so it doesn't draw much current. Because current kill VESC. Yet I believe that VESC can run more stable, more reliable and less fragile with SPACE Cell. Because of the BMS, the 30A fuse and no mad lipo unstable discharge could harm it. This is just my speculation though, but now we seen these issues happening more often with VESC. It's time to review the faulty DRV chip, let Vedders get more attention, so we can move on and fix other faulty issue. I'm afraid, it would be though to get CE compliance for instance when a test center really push the limit of VESC.

Thanks, I'll give that a try. 
I'm looking for a more sensitive throttle feel, the Enertion controller somehow feels too ON/OFF for me.
But I hadn't really set evertything according to the instructions so I'll retry at a later stage.

so after learning a bit more, at 60k i loose alot of amps, so thats no good. And obviously at 100k soft rpm limit, all the original power comes back BUT man it still feels much smoother on soft rpm. And when i say smoother, i mean take off. Ever since ive gotten used to this board, it really isnt big deal either way. But since i have a choice, im going with soft rpm. It literally eases in the power.

## \#42 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-02-18T11:01:25.022Z Reads: 241

```

There has been some fierce debate about whether this remote control can actually allow the rider to accelerate in a sensible, safe manner.

Some reports say the controller feels more like a on/off switch rather than an analogue control that allows smooth incremental acceleration.

So I made a video to illustrate the way it works for me. Before making the video I adjusted the PPM settings inside the vesc to suit the controller. The settings I used are MIN 1.19 MAX 2.01. 

I also have a pure carbon fiber lid on my Raptor, which we know can block Radio Signal, it seems to drastically reduce the range of this controller, tall people have drop-out problems when they raise the controller past their waist.

To learn about tuning the vesc ppm settings go here: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-faq-setting-up-receiver-and-brakes/244

Here is my video, I try to ride the board at really low speed, starting & stopping & also using the cruise control function.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEWHhwSDkug

NOTE: The "cruise control" function is not sophisticated. It does not get RPM data back from the VESC. It cannot maintain the set speed if the load on the motor increase or decreases. Example. You are riding along a flat area, you set your cruise control, now you approach an incline, the board will slow down & maybe stop completely.  Example 2. You ride on flat ground, you set the speed, you go down a decline, the load decreases now. Your board will accelerate, It might rapidly accelerate if the hill is steep.

onloop, your motors seems extremly quiet [compared to mine][1], did you run them in FOC mode?

No flashing but the right light turns yellow.

I usually charge it every three to five rides even it would last longer.

use the three pins that are poking up. 

You can see the + and - marked, the minus corresponds with the blackish brown wire, and the red is positive.

there are two sets of 3-pin connectors on the board- I don't think it matters which set you plug it into.

Hello people, absolute rookie here but I have a few questions that after some research I can't seem to find the answer I am looking for. 

I am currently building a board and intend on using either a tacon Bigfoot 160 (245kv) or the MonsterPower 160 (245kv) motors. Depending on which one comes into stock first that is... Both motors are sensor-less so I intended on using the TorqueBoards 12S 120A Car ESC OPTO HV with the UBEC connection that I believe is required for a 2.4ghz receiver.

What I'm curious about is if I can use the Enertion controller for this set up. I realize it mentions compatibility with ESC's but after reading through this thread and seeing how people are tweaking their settings, it's to my understanding that those options are limited to VESC setups. 

I'm interested in this controller type as my friend has a trigger styled controller and I'm not a fan, I'm used to the slide style I have on my Marbel board. Anyways feedback is appreciated, thanks!
```

i cant answer the controller question but i can point out something i see maybe wrong with your picked motors. the tacon is fine and a great pick but the monster uses a 10mm shaft. this means that the motor pulleys sold by enertion and DIYelectric(torqueboards) will not work with it, you would have to get one from aliendrivesystems
```

## \#60 Posted by: trbt555 Posted at: 2016-05-10T21:30:16.487Z Reads: 171

```
The enertion controller puts out a standard pulse width modulated signal which should be compatible with an ordinary RC ESC.
BUT the controller does not offer any trimming features so you will be unable to fine tune throttle response unless your esc has a feature to do this.
I cannot remember having ever seen an rc esc that does this though.

Thanks for the responses, after much research (yes even in the short period of time since i asked the question lol) i have decided to change my current route. I thoroughly enjoy the idea of having greater control of my motor and settings so i decided to buy a VESC. Unfortunately the one i bought isn't currently available so i will run an esc until its ready. Again thanks for the feedback @trbt555.

Also, @delta_19 i did notice the 10mm shaft and was researching places to buy a pulley with the proper pitch, teeth width, flanges etc. Most manufactures of pulleys seem to have a "plain bore" finish which from what i understand means i would have to drill the shaft diameter myself. Considering my lack of tools and the fact that i would need to very precisely bore out that pulley, i bailed on all the 10mm shaft motors that i was looking at but thanks for the recommendation of "aliendrivesystems."
