Used Flipsky 6354 motor for sale.
Ridden for about 100 miles, sensor died on me one day though.
Motor works fine in sensorless mode.
Motor can is a little loose, so it moves maybe about 0.5mm, not enough to cause any problems but you can hear it rattle a little over bumpy roads and cracks.
Definitely not a loose magnet though.
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H3QHM2rGPY&feature=youtu.be) of it on my current build, it's the one on the right.
$37 shipped to the US.
