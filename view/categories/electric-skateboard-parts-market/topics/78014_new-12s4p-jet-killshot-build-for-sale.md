That's not the new prototype deck you were showing me at your pad the other day that I said I want is it? When do you think you'll be getting some of those so I can swoop one and sample / test it for you. I want to buy it for my new SR RKP / 6shooter set up but am getting antsy on wanting a new deck asap so hoping sooner than later. Got another thing/noice that I can't figure out after adjusting my motors the other day so im gonna send you a video on now but I will still come by when I get back from AZ in another week or two. TGIF my dude! @psychotiller

I love this build! Got to try it first hand and it hauls! This is not the new prototype deck. The new one is 40'', I believe. That is going to be sweet! Cant wait to get my hands on the new prototype, either.
