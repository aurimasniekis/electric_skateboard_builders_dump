12S 48V 60A BMS + 12S charger.  Never opened, never wired, never fired.

PRICE: $90 (includes 2-day USPS Priority Mail). 

You would pay $98 + 30 shipping if you order these items yourself and they will arrive in 30 days from China  (batterysupports.com)

REASON FOR SELLING:  I have never even fired or plugged in the bms or charger. I built a 12s4p battery pack and instead opted to go for a 12S balance charger (EV-PEAK A9) after ordering these parts.

are you in nyc area?

And, off topic, does the A9 do bulk charging 12s (without balance leads)? With Adjustable termination (for example 4.1v per cell)?

No you have to still wire in balance wires.  Dont get me wrong you can still charge in non-balance mode but then you have to make the cell voltage is correct by checking and re-checking.

I'd be interested, but I don't think you'd like my offer (at least not yet).
If you decide the price isn't final, let me know.

My max would be $80 shipped (to ~Seattle) :confounded:.

Probably lower than you'd be willing to accept at this point, but since I can find that same BMS and a decent 12s 4a charger for a bit under $90 total/shipped, 2nd hand, $80 is the most that would make sense for me.
