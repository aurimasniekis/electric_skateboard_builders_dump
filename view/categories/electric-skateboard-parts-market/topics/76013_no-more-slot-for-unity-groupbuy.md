With the recent release of the Maytech dual VESC and their single 100A VESC, I have decided to spread my money between a few different controllers to see how they all work. I am on the list for 4 Unitys, but I now would only like 1.

For the other 3, I will pay for them if no one else wants them by the time they ship, but if anyone wants them please speak up now! Otherwise Iâ€™ll just end up selling them as soon as I get them.

Comparing it to vesc 4.12 or 6 just doesn't make a lot of sense as it is pretty different from both. Two motors are controlled by the same MCU. We focused on improvements that packed the most punch, added some new features (power switch, integrated bluetooth) and a huge focus on ease of use to make setup fast/easy/safe.  Centralized control of dual motor setups just simplifies a lot of things and creates a more central hub both on the physical side for wiring and on the software side for connecting apps etc.

Ok cool! But does it use current measurement on all three phases or just 2 phases? Also what driver chip does it use?

Also what tool would one use to change the parameters?

```

---
## \#40 Posted by: thisguyhere Posted at: 2018-11-27T19:35:52.364Z Reads: 64

guessing about 230eur.

but..everything's called for and another 15 people or so waiting...so kind of late to get in on this group buy.

## \#41 Posted by: Moros Posted at: 2018-11-27T19:44:58.669Z Reads: 62

I will have 2 extra in EU once they ship. No final price yet. Need to wait until customs gets its slice of the pie to know final cost.

No problem, I will order 1 in my enertion order.

Btw is there no chance to setup a +100 pieces unity groupbuy? * 

"Buy 100 or above and pay only â‚¬184.87 each"  that's really cheap
```

---
## \#43 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-11-27T19:51:56.648Z Reads: 63

```
Not sure about the customs.
If you order 100 to EU you will probably need to pay 20-30% import taxes on that price.
```

Here in belgium we have on each package above 22 euro's, 21% import tax and a administration fee off 25 euro
```

---
## \#45 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-11-27T20:08:11.354Z Reads: 54

```
So about 220â‚¬ in the end, plus shipping in the EU 10â‚¬ or so. Thatâ€™s in the end only 30â‚¬ less and you need to buy 100 unitys for which you need to have the money first. Good price still, but also big risk as I assume there will be not 100 people ordering them directly in one gb.
