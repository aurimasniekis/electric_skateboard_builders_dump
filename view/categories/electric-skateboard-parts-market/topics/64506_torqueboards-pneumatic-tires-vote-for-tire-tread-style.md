We're coming out with some new 160x50 All Terrain Street Tires and 180x50 Off-Road Tires. 180x50 drawing coming at a later time.

Help us choose our first 160x50 Pneumatic Tire Tread!

I'm voting B for presumably the best contact patch and *probably adequate enough* water channeling for those with water resistant rides.

B is perfect, kinda looks like the Bridgestone Potenza RE-71R my favorite street/track tire.

The tread on C is nice. Would be interesting to see the center straight channel treads to move closer together like the image eboosted linked.

Agreed. Aesthetically, C is the winner in my book... but with the center channels more narrow like you said. ✔️

What hubs will they fit? Would fit in the Trampa ones?

[/quote]

We have some custom hubs for these pneumatic tires. They'll fit standard 8mm axles specifically our 218mm TB Trucks with a 62T HTD5 15mm Pulley w/ Bearing. We'll have a 160x50 All Terrain Street and a 180x50 Off-Road Tire. We can always add more down the line if everyone finds a need for it.

Thanks

I think would be great if they fit more standard hubs like Trampa and mainly evolve, I bet a lot of people would buy them if the price is good and the last, but the downside is that you don’t sell your hubs as much

The tires will probably fit Evolve/Trampa...

The point of it is that we don't have specific all terrains for DIY setups. The available MTB and Evolve Pneumatics only fit Evolve/Trampa setups so they aren't as universal.

So not sure how that would be beneficial more so? Why wouldn't you just use Trampa/Evolve tires for Trampa/Evolve Trucks?

Just curious but they should all be interchangeable overall. Would still have to test though.

The more options the better, I’m about to jump on the pneumatics boat, but until I experience myself I fear they wearing down too fast, not cheap to replace tires often

If the durability is similar to @psychotiller 6x2 tires I bet your stock won’t last a day

Yeah, would be awesome if there was a standard. I'll double check they should all fit.

Tire durability is comparable. Should last for a long time.

I think the only ones that wore out too fast were Skikes.

I like the idea of having a channel down the center or dual channels just off the center of the tire (that @Eboosted suggested) for wet conditions and street conditions. This is a science I am sure someone will jump in with the data on different patterns and trade-off.  The most important question I have is what max PSI/BAR are your designing for?  I have see street 200mm range from 35-75 PSI.

Whats the story with Trampa at 75psi? did they add more ply? The Kenda tires I am running are 50 PSI and 4 ply... I also have some more aggresive Cheng Shin that are only 35PSI and marked 4P.R. Nylon I am thinking they may also be 4ply however not near as stiff as the Kenda.

This is the Kenda tread and these last....Pretty hard rubber compared to the Cheng Shin.  I have been only using the Cheng Shin in the MN winter months (Yes we get Snow and Ice)

Since this community loves to dig deeper and know how things work here are a few interesting articles to explain tyre design.  I think for Esk8 application the following should be considered: Tread Pattern, Compound, Ply's, PSI and overall side wall stiffness. 

Maybe someone more informed can make a matrix for trade off's.  The exciting thing is @torqueboards is making a new tyre and even better asking the community what we desire...

I thought about it but we're releasing a 110x65 Kegel core style wheel which has much thicker urethane and wider than a 125mm gummie. With a 15mm / .59" difference I don't see the point much in offering a similar option.

[quote="Andy87, post:32, topic:64506"]

As far as pulley's being compatible. I don't think they are as I didn't design them to be. The pulley will fit into the hub vs being bolted onto the rim itself.

Tires should be pretty compatible though.

I see your point - that being said I would also love to be able to have hubs to switch back and forth between urethane and pneumatic without having to get extra pulleys for thick urethane wheels vs mtb hubs

That makes sense but wouldn't you have to take it apart anyways to swap it? You're either taking out the pulleys or the rims itself unless you have two sets entirely (wheels + pulleys) which would make a quicker swap. Which means you'd still need extra pulleys.

Dude, if you haven't already, get the Sonic app.  Anytime you order through that you get 1/2 off drinks/slushes.  AND they have limited time deals like "half off blasts" or "free medium slush eith any purchase".... 

So dope.

@torqueboards I need these pneumatics right now please. Like I mean right now.. I want to order more evolve knobbys but sold out everywhere.. trampas duties taxes shipping candian exchange make them more then car tires lol . please make a 160 mm mud snow all terrain tire..there is lots of big knobbys. 175mm and up. Go 160mm low profile aggressive all terrain like the pavment queen mud trucks tires they have out now.
 the best all round real mud bogging capabile and highway tire I've used in my bogging road monster truck days and being smooth and handle fast corners on the pavement was a toyo open country tire. the tread design works great is all types of weather no hydro planning on the highway during down Poor's the snow and mud it just diggs and chews threw any terrain![Screenshot_20181210-080823|256x500](upload://6U8GLq00ve0OGFpiYmPjxf2HY99.jpeg) 
 just tighen up the lugs for a smoother ride but put Side biters luggs on them they work well in sand ..
Micky Thompson Baja claw is good tire too not as highway friendly being a softer sidwall. just a thought on some A/T treads patterns to think on .. but I'd like some street right MEOW please. Whats the ETA on them CHEERS
