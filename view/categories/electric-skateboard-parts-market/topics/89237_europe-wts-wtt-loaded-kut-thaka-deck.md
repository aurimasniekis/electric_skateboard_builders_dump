Hello,
I have a Loaded Kut Thaka deck for sale, I am also willing to trade it. 
I like this little deck a lot but the wheelbase is just a few centimeters to short for the build i have in mind.
So if you have a jet spud , a Tayto , or a similar deck i'll be happy to trade (+ some xtra cash depending of the condition).

The Kut Thaka is almost new BUT some paint went of when i tried to carbon wrap it (see pics). 
it  has never been ridden . I've only attached the trucks once for testing purposes.
