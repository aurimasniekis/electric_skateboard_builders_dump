I bought a 29" jet potato from www.muirskate.com and talked with Scott Lembach.

There is presently one  29" jet potato available on their website ready to ship! 
So if you want to get hold of one and want it delivered quick grab it before it goes.

Price is $65.95USD 

Here's the link:

Comment if you buy it so the topic can be closed.

Cheers!

I really want one of these decks at some point. Should probably get one of my two boards working first tho.....

I feel you... my plan with it is to deck swap my current setup and keep improving it from there while keeping on building my crazy dual drive
