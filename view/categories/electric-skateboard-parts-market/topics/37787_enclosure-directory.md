I thought it might be a good idea to start a thread where people can market their enclosures.  There are a ton of good ones out there right now and I know there are certain users on the forum, like @MasterCho, @Dunkirk and several others that build them.  However, it seems to be hard to find their original threads, or any other new ones, like @bigben that will be starting to sell theirs. 

Here is a place to list off any enclosure sellers or give suggestions on where to buy a good looking enclosure.  The purpose of this thread is not to say how to make one, because there are many focused on that, but I am personally looking to buy a good looking one for another build I am doing and have had a hard time rounding up my options.  I'm sure this will be helpful to many!

Look at psychotiller.com, @psychotiller makes tons of different dimensions and all if them are solid as a rock.  I've bought 10 from him in the last year or so.

Look here for several enclosures and a good lead on custom enclosures.

@psychotiller, what material do you typically use for your enclosures?

Cheers @ShutterShock.
Yep I'm making some from fibreglass. I've got a few different shapes and am making more all the time. If you have an idea of something different I can either adapt an existing or sometimes make a new mould if it is interesting. The main one I started with is the one I made for a landyachtz 9 two 5. This was to fit a 10s4p, large bms and two vescs. It's shaped to the w concave of the board and will fit a range of decks with rubber strip. Internal measurements are 545mm x 145mm x 40mm. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/c/7c00102a9b4ee3db75c52b6372e687e216194ec4.JPG" width="375" height="500">I've also made another one suiting  a flatter deck.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/5/657c1e44a22904b680734bd70ba5799de35892c2.jpeg" width="666" height="500">
I made deeper shorter one too which may suit some applications <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/b/ebe09bb00762562cad80435604f3b329a4cbbed8.JPG" width="666" height="500">and an even shorter version which I used on my kids board. .<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/e/5eee67983bacdff868dab1579579488f3b6082de.JPG" width="375" height="500"> <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/b/fb853eb478f9c894360c8980dcf83cbba082cbe0.JPG" width="375" height="500">
I'm in the process of making a slimline version of my first enclosure that should suit a 10s4p but with a smaller bms.  It will measure 30mm deep instead of 40mm.
I'm UK based and have found shipping options to US and Australia that are very reasonable.
