I have 4  of the motors that @JLabs is selling ,up for sale

Literally brand new, never used, I purchase 4, 1 came defective (The bearing was not seated all the way in, so the circlip would not clip into place) I damaged the bearing trying to push it in.  I purchased a new bearing and replaced it.  Motor works fine but the new bearing still has the same issue as the first one. It wont sit all the way into the housing.  

I cant get a refund on any of the motors (not even the defective one)  And i dont need them anymore.  So these are going to get sold for really cheap. 

buy each for $50 + shipping,  buy 3 get the last one free.   thats all they're worth if you ask me, not that $80+ shipping  hes charging.  my loss your gain!

Motors all sold!  That company was a nightmare and i just wanted the motors gone even if i lost over $110 dollars.  It was worth it to make a point that some company's are not worth dealing with.
