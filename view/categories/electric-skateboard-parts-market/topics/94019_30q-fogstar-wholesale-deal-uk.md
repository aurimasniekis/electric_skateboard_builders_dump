Fogstar wholesale have reduced their 30Q price

https://www.fogstar-wholesale.co.uk/product/samsung-30q-2/?attribute_packaging=None+%28Factory+Box%29

It should be that little bit cheaper than NKON if you have a UK address, maybe even you need to convert sterling to Euros..but yeah more for UK folks
