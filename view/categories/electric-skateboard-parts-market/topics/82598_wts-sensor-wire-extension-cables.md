As the standard 1.5 to 2mm jst motor sensor cable extension are too short for my build I plan to order some with custom made length.
1.5mm 6pin jst zh male on one side
2mm 6pin jst ph female on the other side
![image|690x401](upload://z7GLpozfaG5GVFmXL1cbOzHYUhe.jpeg) 

Price per cable would be 1.75-2.00$ plus shipping. 
I was interested if somebody else is interested in some longer adapter cables too and which length would be needed most.
[poll]
 - 200mm
 - 300mm
 - 600mm
[/poll]

For people with APS motors I could get an extra option (1.5mm female to 2mm female) 
if thatâ€™s what you would need, let me know in the comments please.

EDIT: I will add some vesc CAN bus cables to the list.
Just let me know how long the wires should be.
1$ per cable and available from next week.

20cm 1.75$

20cm with sleeve 2.50$

60cm 2.00$

60cm with sleeve 3.50$

Shipping:
Up to 2 cables without sleeve can be sent as letter untracked 2.50$ but might take a while.

If you need more than two cables than I can sent them out worldwide tracked for 6.50$

Status:

20cm 45x available

60cm sold out - if there is enough interest than I can order some more.

The problem for me that the 300mm still too short in case you mount your vescs in the middle of the deck.

Thx! I have all to make my own adapters if needed, but I hate crimping jst ðŸ˜…
So the question was just if there is a general interest in those adapter or not.
If no, iâ€˜ll just make my own adapter.

These would be compatible with most motors including Maytechs? I'd be interested!

Yes, all motors which come with a 1.5mm female jst. If you have one with custom sensor wires, this wouldnâ€™t be needed.

## \#12 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2019-02-02T05:37:41.268Z Reads: 115

```
To make this a bit more concrete,
I could get a 20cm and a 60cm version for 1,5-1.75$ a piece.
Price would be the same for both options.
If we get as min 20 people together, I would go for this.
Shipping excluding, but shouldnâ€™t be that much as this wires not weight a lot ðŸ˜…

Iâ€˜m sure you can get the price even more down if you buy in bigger bulk, but as I have quite limited budget thatâ€™s the lowest price I can get to.

They will fit the focbox for sure, but I canâ€™t tell you about the sk8 as i unfortunatelly donâ€™t own one by myself.
If somebody can confirm the sk8 motor comes with 1.5mm jst female plug, than yes it will work.

Sent me a pm with your PayPal account and the shipping address.
I will sent you an invoice than.

Also let me know how long you want to have your CAN cables.

But might take some days.

Let me count through it tomorrow.
Might be close with the 60cm cables, but if I did count right than there are 4 left ðŸ˜‰
I used all sleeves today, new one will be here end of the week, so shipping would be probably beginning next week only.
If thatâ€™s still ok with you sent me a pm with your PayPal address and shipping address.
