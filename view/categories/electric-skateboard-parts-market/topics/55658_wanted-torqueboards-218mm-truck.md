I bent an axle on my front truck. Just need the hangar and diyelectricskateboards won't sell me just the hangar or just a single truck.

I did the same thing I bent an axle on my front hanger and @torqueboards helped me out and sold me the one truck. Contact dexter he will help you. 

Btw you guys should start selling single trucks on the website.

Not easily in my case. A car ran over my board and it was caught under the vehicle for over a hundred yards.
