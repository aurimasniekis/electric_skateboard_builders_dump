These will be available in about a week. We are waiting on the vertical usb connectors. In the photo you can see the right hand VESC's usb port creates a space conflict. Luckily we found a compatible vertical usb port so no gerber file changes are necessary to make this happen. The best part about this design option is none of the VESC features are lost and it remains completely modular.

can't you just turn one vesc upside down? then that USB port will be facing the otherway?

You could but the jst ports would then be on opposite sides and awkward to use while also increasing the overall thickness of the package.

Can't you just install the JST on the opposite side you normally would?

No, there are spacing conflicts on the bottom side that will not allow it.

makes the upright USB a good solution then

This is pretty close to what i was planning to do with mine once i got them. I wasn't thinking about the USB ports though. i suppose i'll have to spread mine out a little more to accommodate, or program them prior to bolting them down. 

So what are you going to charge for these?

@chaka have you shipped my vesc's yet? If not, I'm thinking I'd like to wait for the dual with heat sink.

It is an extra $10 for a dual VESC with the aluminum base. If you want heat sinks mounted to the fets it is an additional $10, this charge is mainly for the time evolved in mounting them.

:) It is a good thing I checked this forum before printing shipping labels this morning! You sure you want to wait?  That build you have going is looking pretty sweet!

When I have all the gear to make this happen you can send the vesc modules back to be retrofitted with a vertical usb ports and heatsinks.

I will be selling a DIY kit to mount an un-modified pair VESC's to a base plate too. The result is only 20mm wider than the modified version.

I like how it remains a modular package so if you blow a VESC you only need to replace half.

Hello 

This is great I will like to reserve 2 sets with the heat sink. 

How we go about this ?

Hmm how are you planning to mount that? The holes in the vesc are being used to hold it to the aluminum plate so will there be holes in the aluminum plate to mount to the board? I like this idea a lot. Especially since you are planning to sell a kit for this.

There exists a tool called a drill for that.

Sorry, was feeling cheeky today ;-)

You could use clips or adhesive pads to mount this version. I can also add mounting tabs or extend the edges of the base by request.

@barajabali  If you leave me a note during checkout stating you would like the dual VESC heatsink package I will send you an invoice for the added charge of $30.

Please be aware we are about 3-4 weeks out right now on VESC orders.

Yes, sorry for the hassle. We do not stock a large quantity of parts for this mod so it is reserved for community members as an "off menu" item.

I don't know what the white plug outlets I normally see on vescs are called (jst?) but these two vescs have none of them and I like that a lot as it seems theyre unnecessary for me.  Once the vesc is programmed to match the motor I figured I'd never have to even use the mini-sub again. If later the plugs are needed I imagine you can add the outlet. 
chaka sent me a pair stacked and even with all the white plugs attached they're pretty thin and I like how I can have all my components on one side.  Getting thin is a goal but incorporating the batteries..ultimately this is ideal for me and this is even a dropped through drop deck

He's sending me another set since I damaged these running them with a shorted motor.   Hes going to repair them and I'm glad to hear they're repairable.  hopefully the new pair won't have any white plugs! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2e8f94d2f5b29505f11c17656615c7f6b71b389a.jpeg" width="375" height="500">


I didnt check the vescs temp often and more so was just checking the motor temp at the tops of hills but the few times I did check the temp of the fets on the vesc it was always cool. Maybe with a hub motor it's less comutations and that's the reason but regardless I have stick-on heat sinks I planned to add but don't think I'll bother

I dont think you will see much heat on a dual vesc configuration. A single motor build will pull many more amps through the vesc.

I should be able to make it a bit more compact without the jst headers.

All those white plugs..who needs them?  Other than the mini-usb I haven't felt a need.  I did try the one for the nunchuck and found it loses connection way too easily so won't bother again.   
I ask because as you have the boards here they look nice and slim and preferred.  Would it be possible to get the vesc this way and if we did ever need to access something which had a plug couldn't we add the plug later?

I doubt many skateboarders need them.
