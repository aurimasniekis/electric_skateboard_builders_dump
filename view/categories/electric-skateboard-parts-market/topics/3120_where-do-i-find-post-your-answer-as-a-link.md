Sometimes you just need help finding that ONE thing...but you don't know what to search for or where to lüëÄk...or you found it but aren't sure....So post what your looking for on this thread.

Aways......

I'm looking for a nice piece of plain aluminum 36t pulley 5m pitch 9mm width ... Need it flat with no collar, flange or ridges ...I don't want to grind down an Enertion pully to get one..I just need the disk part of the pulley 

So post up a link to answer my question

I want to bolt it to a weird 83mm wheel that is flat on one side

I can't flip the Enertion pulley because the other side has a flange that sits on the hub recess .... And I don't want to destroy the pulley for this project

Yeah I like the aluminum ones too!

 Oh well...I think @Alex gave me the correct link...Ill have to play with the drop down choices and see if I can get the pully I want .....

I'm trying to mod a strange non-standard wheel that has a totally flat inner wheel.  The pulley on it now it plastic...and now I put a 50mm motor (before it was 12v brushed motor) on it and the belt that it came with will last abt one ride...it's like a rubber band...prob rip the teeth off the belt if I run it.  If I can't get a pulley then I will need to use 83mm and need a shim so the wheel can align with the motor pulley.

thanks guys !!!!

@Michaelinvegas - way back when I was looking for stuff to make an esk8 I used a water jet company (www.marzee.com) out of Phoenix AZ to make  gears, washers, mounts.  The gear specified is 36t 5m pitch and .5" wide.  Its been 2 years and everything still works.  When the parts came to me they were a bit sharp but just took some sand paper to knock the edges off. Here is the invoice with the cost and contact info.  The prices may have gone up a bit since and you may have to open an account but no biggie its just filling out info.  If interested I will send you the file I sent to them.

I was using a little NTM prop with this set up for abut 2 years, 8 miles to work and 8 home when I could with no issues except for ESC burn ups. I recently graduated to a spacecell, VESC and hub motors from Hummie and Jacob so I will probably put the NTM system on my daughters board.

Most of the clones are brand less so shops can't stock them and, shops don't like stocking cheap clones of what they sell. I made a stock alert thread though and found a seller that will have more in 4 weeks

How big @barajabali ? When you get into large PVC shrink they measure by the diameter of it when flat. But most of the time it will be flat diameter. Just do an ebay search. 

I sue this to wrap my battery packs:

 I'm not sure how wide your total pack is but i am sure there would be a PVC wrap that fits it.
