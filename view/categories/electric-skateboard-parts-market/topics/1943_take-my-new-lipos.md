I made a couple with resin and carbon making a mold.  Fits the tacon and kegel.  Please take them!! I've got 120 hub motors coming in the mail in 3 days and want them out.

Is there any way to modify them to be adjustable? Fit caliber trucks? What motor pulley, wheel pulley and belt size does it need to work?
```

They're permanently on caliber.  Not adjustable.  9mm belt.  They're set to go with 17x 36 tooth pulleys I think.  It's been a while.

If u took the trouble to put new pulleys in a distance calculator u could put different pulleys on and with a different belt.  The mount has the motor in a fixed position so you have to work around that

What's the center to center distance, and what length belt worked with your 17/36 setup?

Sorry it's been so long I don't remember.  It's about as tight a fit as possible. 17 tooth was the minimum and still having enough teeth engagement.

```
So, would your mount come with a 17mm pulley and belt to match, or is it just the mount/truck only?
