Hi, I destroyed my Yuneec E-go motor trying to hammer out the axle. The plastic frame used to hold the magnets is extremely brittle and splintered apart. 

Anyone have a used one for sale?

I doubt anyone has an extra one. You can buy another one from Yuneec or you can find a similar motor based on the Yuneec Motor's specs.

I have a full brand new rear truck assembly with motor. Yuneec sells them for $170 I believe. Pm me an offer.

I have a brand new motor in box ready for use. It's my spare - I got it for $70 from a partner.  I'm going back to campus in a two weeks and can ship it then if you're interested.

Thanks a bundle KM! I was able to arrange something with Yuneec... It will cost a bit more than yours but will get here faster. Much appreciated!
