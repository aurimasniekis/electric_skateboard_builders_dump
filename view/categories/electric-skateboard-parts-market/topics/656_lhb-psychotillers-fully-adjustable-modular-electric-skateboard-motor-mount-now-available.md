Mounts so fresh they'll slap your momma. Straight from SoCal,  these fully adjustable, fully modular, fully reversible, fully bad ass looking mounts are machined from 6061 aluminum and fastened with stainless steel hardware. Fits Caliber IIs and can be mounted forward or rear facing on either side of the truck, so it should work just fine with any deck. Shown here mounted to an Enertion R-SPEC 6355.

I love this mount. I am curious how do you apply tension to the belt? Are the slots in the 4 holes of the motor mount big enough to apply adequate tension?

Thank you @King1017,
Yup! The slots enable you to pull the motor back while you tighten the bolts. That is all you need to properly tension your belts. Using tools or mechanical spreaders pretty much always over tightens them.

Thanks @sl33py! 
 I used powdercoat. When tightened together it offers a locktight type grip between the clamp and the mount. And it doesn't affect the aluminum.

Let me know and I'll get you a set sent out!

No...Unfortunately the shape of the sidewinder requires a weld fit.  You could weld a round piece to the hanger though! Then you could bolt my motor mount to that and have the same great adjustability. Best of both worlds.

If you bought one of my mounts you could use the flex clamp as your pattern piece.

Not sure if you're aware of this but one of the appealing features of the TKP Hex is that they are modular so for your clamp prototyping you coral actually just order a hex hangar.

@Monk - I most definitely agree... I've realized time and time again that all the bells and whistles I never actually use. I've actually worked on a new motor mount which is a lot more simple and much more durable.

@psychotiller - You should definitely test out the TKP trucks. They're pretty awesome.

I wish this classic RKP trucks were more of a basic hanger to have much more room for adjustment.

Ok so with tax return money in hand I'm finally able to get started on my build. I will post images as I acquire the components. This board is to be used primarily as a commuter. Not looking for any blazing top speeds as I probably can't run out anything faster than 10 -12mph. Not sure as I haven't been on a board in almost three decades. I'm an avid cyclist so not in the worst shape for a middle aged man. I would like to have torque on hand when needed. Expected commute distance is 8 - 10 miles. And something very stable and able to handle the winter beaten streets here in Michigan. After much contemplation I have settled on a ThreeSix Top Mount board in silver with black grip tape applied, TKP Hex trucks in Black with the black 92a bushings and pivot cups, Spectra Bomber wheels, Space Cell, Vedder's VESC, and hopefully Psycotiller's mounts for the TKP's. If not then Torque's mounts in black. The theme is pretty much a black and silver throughout color scheme.  Still looking at motors that will follow this scheme. I think I saw NLT? 50 - 60 270kV motors in that color. Hopefully two higher kV motors approaches the torque value of a single low kV motor. Pics to follow soon!

I hope my preferences didn't come off as whining you into tackling the TPK's. Hopefully I am one of many who have lobbied your talents for this setup. Please feel free to lie if necessary to ease my conscience. I hate to pile on but I'd like to ask your opinion on raw vs powder coated. If you've seen the TPK I'm referencing everything is black. Rather stealthy. Do you think raw hangers would lend a nice contrast? Is this possible? The motors I was looking at are the Propdrive 50-60 270kV and have a nice contrast themselves for my theme. I thought I saw something similar labeled NLT 50-60 but am unable to relocate as I failed to bookmark. The kV might have even been lower. (side note: I work on systems in the 225 -450kV range but not the kV as used here. I'm talking almost a half meV) I know I'm probably sounding divaish but I can see in my mind's eye what I'd like. I'm humbled that your willing to help me achieve that vision.

I'll have to take a peak at the RPK's. I'm referencing the TPK's from the standpoint of how much (or little) it is to get into a pair of them vs the price points of some of the "precision" trucks I've viewed. Given my intended use I am probably already overshooting my needs engineering wise. But you can't shake cool if it's not gonna break the bank. I am ecstatic that there are some of you out there lending your time to tackle these queries. I suspect we will be conversing when it's time to employ the speed controller hardware aspect of my build and am thankful to have you as a resource.

RKP's are nice too but the Hex TKP are a no brainer because of the ease of the hex hanger.

It's worth spending on the trucks considering everything else we buy for eboards is pricey.

Hahaha! No not at all! I'm all about surf rodz trucks and I have ridden a few pair. Honestly I was so focused on getting my randal clamp made (which has become the bane of my existence) That it hadn't even occured to me. I think if you're going stealthy you should stick with the theme! This batch of mounts I have are flat black which will add contrast anyway. Or if you'd like before I do the powder coat on the tkp clamp, we can discuss a different finish? 
I'm going to order my trucks tonight so that gives me joy :smirk:

@psychotiller I'm gonna wanna go with a 3:1 36:12 ratio. I know it's not recommended to go lower than a 13 tooth pulley because of there not being enough messed teeth, so I've realized I would need an idler bearing. With your optional idlers would I be able to fit a 256 belt or which ever one normally comes with enertion kits.

Maybe I need to slow my roll on the idlers as I've not even begun assembling the drivetrain yet. I may be looking for a solution for a problem that doesn't exist. Regarding the TKP's, I'm still in a back and forth with them about what exactly I can get from them. I do have Caliber II's on the way for drivetrain testing but before I commit to TKP's is there any chance a clamp for their new pricey but sexy stealthy trucks will materialize? Given the complexity of the hanger profile I'm not holding out much hope.

I had a look at them at HK and just my luck they are out of stock....arrrrg. Not sure what the physical dimensions for this motor are as the naming convention like "6364" is not used so I'm curios if their size allows for a twin rear side by side configuration? Would I have to go down to 9mm bets from 15 to achieve this? Remember aim starting with the 10" Caliber II 50's. I thought I saw someone post that the hangars are shorter than most other 10" trucks. Fact of fiction?

In a separate note, at the risk of coming off as a lazy DIY'er I ordered a battery case and a battery pack today. Is was mainly curios how the case would look under my deck and $49 for it didn't seem to risky, but then I said what the hell and ordered the 24 cell battery pack that goes inside of it. Very few specifications were available, like the distance between the front and rear truck mounting holes. Sure hope I don't have to poke any more holes in my brand new board. Labeled as "Generic" I'm guessing the batteries are mediocre at best. And there's no bums. So I do get to play with that part of the power system.

Wheels and pulleys are also a factor when spacing out your motors/mounts on the hanger. I'm tempted to say the g160s will fit dual rear, on caliber with my mounts. Depending on your choice of wheels/pulley.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e1a69f29022ad08bcf006841714be137da12386f.jpg" width="689" height="390">

Now that my friend is a killer setup you got there! I'm pretty pumped about these Spectra Bomber wheels I bought but I have no doubt that at some point I will be trying out a set of pneumatics.

I'm looking at getting some custom made trucks which are going to be about 190-200mm with extended axles. It will allow us to have 15mm belts as a standard as well as use bearings for pulleys and/or even use 6365 motors instead of 6355.

Not sure, if others have experience with the longer trucks but the longer trucks have awesome lean at least on the surf rodz. You can completely lean without worrying about falling over on "other shorter trucks". So it's pretty awesome carving..

Don't know if this has been answered yet, but what size belts would be needed for a 14/36 or 16/36 setup with this mount? According to this belt length calculator, it looks like 255mm, but the belts for sale on your site are 265mm. Looks like you'd have to run a 20T motor pulley for a 265mm belt. Is there enough adjustment range in your mount to accommodate 265mm belts with a 14/36 or 16/36 setup? If not, where would you recommend getting belts to fit your mount?

V belt online. You'd need the 255.

Is there any advantage of getting your 66mm center  to center mount over your 60mm?

The only reason I made it was to run a 60t pulley.  If you are running under a 50t pulley you don't need it. And the 60mm looks more compact. Better I'm my opinion.

I like the minimal look and the ability to reverse mount them. When will you have these in stock again?

I had a few issues this last month with loose fitting clamps. So I stopped sales and took them back to my guy. Turns out it wasn't really my machine shops fault. Caliber 2 trucks are extremely inconsistent in size.  They seem to be hand finished on a belt sander. Anyway, today we figured out a solution and my mounts will be available Friday. They will all include a shim. Some trucks won't need it and some will.

Good because i'm tired of not making mad cash every month. Your mounts really moved, and if you get them back up on my site soon i'll get some other belt sizes to accommodate. 

What were the popular sizes you suggested on yours? Enertion's is a 265 53t. I vaguely recall yours needing a 255 or something close to that if using a 15/36 or similar pulley set-up.  I could be way off, its been a while.

Should probably be able to use a 255-265 for the shortest distance possible.
