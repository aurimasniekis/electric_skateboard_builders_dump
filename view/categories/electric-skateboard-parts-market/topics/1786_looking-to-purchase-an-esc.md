I would recommend a wiiceiver with an FVT esc. They work great with my setup and are no where near as much as the VESC, all though I do like it. Here are the links to what I bought - 

WiiCeiver - http://austindavid.com/jm3/index.php/hardware/3-wiiceiver
I got the kit a purchased a Nyko Kama from Amazon but it was the same price as buying a complete kit

FVT 120A ESC - http://www.rcjuice.com/fvt-120a-brushless-sensored-sensorless-car-esc-2-6s/
I would highly recommend it and it's affordable. Austin from 'WiiCeiver' is a great guy and will help you with what ever!

Any  way I hope this was helpful, let me know if you need anymore help!

Don't forget that you need to buy the wiiceiver for it, not a regular throotle stick. It is designed for skateboards and has smoothing. If he still have the completed kit in stock I would but that, it's $50. the kit is $25 and $25 for the Nyko Kama on Amazon. And the FVT only works up to 6s Lipo.. 

Hope your build turns out great!

Ya, meant to say the FVT can only work with a 6s lipo and lower in my above post. 

7s won't work.

Totally get the money savings angle, but the difference in cost is a small price to pay for a true open source ESC that can do so much in such a small package. It is continuously being developed and upgraded to provide the best user experience possible. Supporting the VESC via purchase, use, and word of mouth is the engine that will drive the VESC to even greater levels of affordability, reliability and function. The price is actually quite appealing considering how much power it can handle and how configurable it is. Even if you are only running a 6s system, you still want electronics that are beefy enough to handle MORE. It's better to get the best instead of getting "good enough" in certain circumstances because you will want it down the road anyway. The VESC will give you the headroom you need to grow. It's the brains of your operation.Under $100??
 IMO: Cut cost elsewhere...VESC up!!
