I am currently fixing an Evolve Gen 2 AT for a friend but cannot find remotes in stock anywhere, just wondering if anyone had a spare in good condition or if anyone knew of an alternative remote that works

Pretty sure you if you’re using an evolve esc, you have to use evolve remote but don’t quote me in that.... probably check evolve website??
