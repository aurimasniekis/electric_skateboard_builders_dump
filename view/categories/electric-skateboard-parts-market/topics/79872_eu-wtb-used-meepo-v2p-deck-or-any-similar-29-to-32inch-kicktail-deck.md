Hello, i am looking for someone who is selling a used Meepo V2P 30" or any other similar 29 to 32inch deck.
Something like this one 
https://www.meepo.co.uk/boards-brand/30-meepo-electric-skateboard-v2p.html
I know they can also be bought directly from meepo but i don't want to spend +90 Euro as i have 2 other builds to finish :slight_smile:
