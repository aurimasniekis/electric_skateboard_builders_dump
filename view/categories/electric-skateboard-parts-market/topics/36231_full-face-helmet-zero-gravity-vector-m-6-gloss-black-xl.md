Unused. Great field of view, looks badass. For sizing it's slightly bigger than the TSG Pass XL. I'm selling because it doesn't fit me and I'm still looking for a full face that does.

I bought it for $189. I'm selling it for $175 + shipping.

Bump. Not sure why this helmet doesn't get as much love as the TSG pass, looks great and has a great price.  

Here's an old video of @chaka riding with it on so you can see it in action.
