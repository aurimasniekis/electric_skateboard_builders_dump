You can have the cat , i am pretty sure you'll give him back to me after a day or two. He must be the most annoying cat i've ever seen :slight_smile: 
He sleeps the whole day but as from 03.55 AM he has some crazy shit going on in his head... He then runs eveywhere in the house like he has to win a race or something , cries like a baby and doesn't stop until 04.30AM . He also likes to open the recycle bin to steal food and hide some old pieces of meat under our sofa and somethimes farts when he sits next to you... He absolutely needed to be on that pic , i've pushed him back a few times but he kept comming back...
