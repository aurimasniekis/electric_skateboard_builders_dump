Half a year I already have parts laying at home to make two fire fly remotes. Unfortunately I donâ€™t have a time and after I got the DaveGA @janpom I also donâ€™t have a reason to get telemetry data on my remote.
So i probably will never put the parts together.
But I thought maybe somebody else need them.
So here we are.
I have two sets of parts from the list which @SeeTheBridges linked in his video.
Itâ€™s missing only the Hall effect sensors and the m4 screws.
Without the sensors the parts ar worth 70$ or 35$ for one.
I also have one case already printed, think in PETG but canâ€™t remember, could be PLA too.
If needed I could print another case too.
So what i ask for. I would like to get the 35$ for one or 70$ for two, including shipping (preferred EU, Worldwide possible but probably only without lipos) and if needed the case too (please be kind, iâ€˜m not the best printer)

If you interested just sent me a PM  

Thatâ€™s what you get

Lol, where were you a month ago. I would have snapped on it but the last bit of my parts came in yesterday. This is a deal though. If nothing else, more having to deal with 10+ aliexpress shipments and waiting a month and a half.
