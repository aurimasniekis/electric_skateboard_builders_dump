Hey Guys, 

I have another 30-50 cells available if anyone is interested. The cells come bare or i can leave the wrapping on for you if you like. These cells are 10A cont discharge and are A grade cells used by Tesla who is claiming they last several hundred thousand miles on their cars. They have barely 1 charge cycle on them from me since it was for a PowerWall project but that is a huge commitment of time i don't have right now. 

I am slowly dismantling the power wall i have made already and the cells are for sale. I will ship them in the US, preferable if you're in california (near me) you can pickup. 

I'm letting them go for $4 a cell plus shipping to you. Let me know . I've sold over 200+ of these cells so far.

Pretty neat no lie but I think for people to be interested you'd have to come down to $4 a cell (judging on what I paid for the last group buy we did)

You can buy them new for less than $5 a cell shipped (probably $3-4 if you dig).

@willpark16 @Robert
