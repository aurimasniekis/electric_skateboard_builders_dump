Just wanted to post these on listing, so I can get them out of my hand once I get the delivery. I am not making any money on this.

You can pay when I get the motors. In the Mid-March.

All motors have keyways and silicone wires. If the motor has sensors the wire length will be 230mm. 12 AWG wire is used for the motor.

($55.37)ea   3- 6354 260KV
($85.17)ea   2- 6374 192KV with SENSOR
($86.67)ea   1- 6374 192KV with SENSOR AND EXTENDED 38.5mm shafts
($86.53)ea   1- 6374 149KV with SENSOR AND EXTENDED 38.5mm shafts **(reserved)**
