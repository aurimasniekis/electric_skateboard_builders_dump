Was trying to buy parts and battery from enertion on week ago but couldn't. @onloop said the new one is coming up with new setup and...some switches? I didn't know would come up with this big change..... 

Everyone should have a look now : http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/rechargable-slim-li-ion-lithium-battery-space.html

Does @onloop get anything to say about this new beautiful baby?
