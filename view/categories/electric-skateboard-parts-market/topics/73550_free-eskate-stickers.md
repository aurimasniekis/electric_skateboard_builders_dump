Hi,
So I just wanted to give something back to this awesome community so I came up with the idea of handmade stickers. I hope you like them. :smile: 
I can ship anywhere in the world at my own expense. If you want any just shoot me a pm. :smiley: 

So currently I have two types of stickers:

* **No Hate just skate** from @mmaner

* **Cheaper than your car; cleaner than your car** from @b264 
Currently, I'm waiting to get permission from @Acidfie and @SuperBen to use their designs. :smile:

@Mikenopolis @b264 you are right it is a gear drive no doubt, therefore I wrote "so called" because it's sold as direct drive.

Sorry for disturbing your thread @Mich21050

Maybe see if you can do something like that..

It would be awesome since topcloud spent a lot of time and money on this nice project. I was hoping to do this anyway but it would be a completely new thing to do

In the past two months was a lot ongoing regarding my school and private situation so I wasn't really able to send out the second batch.. I'm sorry guys.
I got everything packed up right now to send everything out on Monday..
@Skunk I'm sorry but it seems like your first batch got lost somehow... I sent packed a little surprise in your letter.... :slight_smile:
