Open to ideas, this is a first draft.

In the wake of people getting ripped off and general fuckery that seems to be happening across this board, let's use this wiki as a source to list trusted members.

## This thread will only contains polls and any discussion will be removed.  Please visit sister thread to discuss:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trusted-sellers-and-builders-these-people-will-not-rip-you-off-discussion-thread/48511/11

Format will be:

* username
* description of goods and services
* poll on positive / negative experience (user submission will be kept anonymous)

This is a wiki so anyone can edit, but history is kept so any bullshit edits will be called out.
