I have about 20 hub motors left and the typical business model is out the window as I want to raise money for metal molds for a high heat nitrile rubber instead of the polyurethane I've been pouring. Car tire rubber in 80 duro!  This is a steal concidering the work I put in and the cost to me of 75$ each motor before taxes, shipping to me, PayPal to the manufacturer, mold making, wheel rubber buying and pouring, and very expensive retaining fluid and high heat epoxy that I use mounting them and the cost of the real Paris trucks.  If you do the math you'll find I might even be losing money not even speaking of my time. 
These are expensive motors because they are machined steel bells with a single steel ring closure and fat bearings not aluminum and tiny screws.   the motors are locked closed and rattle-free and there is a removable flange for replacing the rubber.  If you're not familiar with the design please check it out on the site.  They are built to last forever and I offer a lifetime warranty on the steel version

I'm selling pairs of aluminum motors for 200$ with a pair of Paris black 195 trucks or the all steel version for 250$ also with a pair of the 195 Paris trucks.  

  

I won't sell singles. 

If you PayPal me at humminashadeeba@gmail the amount (friends and family please) I can have them shipped in less than a week with a set of the old polyurethane I've been using so far...and the better 80duro car tire rubber at a very fair price in the future.

Shipping in continental USA is 20$ but beyond that add 60$ and ill refund the difference.

Not trying to tell you how to run your business, but why not sell singles? I think a bunch of people would be on board right away...

polyurethane that is as soft as a skate wheel deteriorates and looses it's mechanical properties at about 160f.  that's all 80 or 90 euro polyurethane.  I didn't know better and now I do.   Nitrile rubber has to be pressed into a mold with a hydraulic press at 350f and can sustain temps of 250 or 300 for hydrogenated nitrile which I'll also be getting samples of.  car tires use a lot of it and it's durable stuff.  I use it and it's good for hundreds of miles if you don't overly cook it.  if you cook it then it doesn't last.  hopefully someone else can tell how they've been doing with it

way too hot, way too fast. 

I could barely run a single with light riding and I weigh just over 140lbs

I  yes the single will get way too hot that's why I don't sell them, two together though I have no problems crushing everything in san francisco and I'm 155.  Hopefully someone can also verify these are good as a pair.

haven't ridden it yet, because my second VESC just came in two days ago. 

check out the build thread I created a few minutes ago, and you'll see what I have planned. It should be running tomorrow afternoon!!

This is a killer sale! What would you suggest for those that are around 230lbs? Are hub motors a realistic option or should I stick to belts and pulleys?

I wonder if inboard is going to have any issues considering there will be a ton of people who are over 180LBS+.

@anorak234 - Single isn't ideal especially for hub motors. It's a fact that hub motors do get hotter. Unless your limiting speed to be much slower. I don't recommend single hub motors setups either. You'll end up burning a motor out due to the heat and  with that said.. might as well buy a dual.

I'm dying to read reviews of all the little hub motors on Kickstarter. I suspect they're saying Oo shit and trying to come up with something that can last past the length of their ad video.  Even if they keep it all with little power I think the rubber will be an issue with all of them as polyurethane can't handle heat and doing hills will be a problem.  You could add a harder core that can handle the heat better but even that's not ideal and would risk separating.  Nitrile rubber or even hydrogenated nitrile defiantely can handle it and has great abrasion and tensile strength and can be 80 duro.  Little car tires.  I'm tempted to do little treads.

 Help me help you.  I'm not here to make money but get the best things made possible. I tell all the ingredients, the manufacturing costs, and offer a lifetime warranty.  who else does that?  I lose money on this as it all goes back into making molds for better rubber.  What other hub motors even use nitrile rubber!?  see through the smoke and marketing, I offer effectively a direct connection to the manufacturer on the most robust design you will come across.  not aluminum in these and the ingredients are equivalent to motors that cost over 4 times the price that are just standard outrunners.  N45sh mags, single strand windings, and .2mm lams, and a .4mm airgap with a thick solid steel flux ring rotor and NSK bearings that are rated for greater load than anything else I've come across

@Hummie I already have your aluminum ones, and they ride quite nice. Haven't gotten many miles on them yet, but so far, so good. I'm sure you already know my intentions to pick up your steel hubs, so you can put me down for a set of the steel ones with trucks. Just gotta raise some more funds in the next month or so. I want to go 4wd for fun and science.

@Hummie I'm on 12s Multistars with Torqueboards 12s ESC's. They're on my short board, so I haven't pushed the top speed limit too much, but they seem to easily get me up to 25+mph. I first tried them on 6s and almost fell asleep going so slow. Lol

I want to try VESC's on FOC soon, but between the additional setup involved, and my fear of frying them accidentally, I'm sticking with the old tried and true 12s car ESC's for now.

Sorry people I didn't include shipping in the price.  Whatever it is has to be added.  20 anywhere in continental us and the other places...it depends and I prefer to get 60$ more and then if there's extra I can return.   "Friends and famil" please or they suck me

Actually, I won't need these to last forever so switching to the aluminum version. Other than shorter lifespan at heated levels, same performance torque/speed?

Yea same.  I'll refund u the difference tomorrow.  They will all go out not tomorrow but the next day.  I do all the rubber in big batches and have to post cure in the oven in bulk for 6 hours and it'll be done then

I'm not sure and will have to check tomorrow.  

But ur picture makes u look big!  I have other motors I'm getting made u might be more interested in


All steel
2x as long (same 80mm diameter as kegels but instead of 56 long they're 110mm long)
3x as powerful
(4770 stator instead of the other motors 4725
Full magnet fill not 80%)
Two huge sealed NSK bearings instead of the one and a smaller


These are more expensive at 185 to me before any expenses (PayPal to and shipping from China)and work I do to them (clean them out of cutting fluid, clean all bearing surfaces and add high heat retaining fluid and mounting them on trucks). or the rubber (steel  mold cost and each rubber cost) I'm going to sell them 300$ each or two for 500$.  If u add up all the costs and the work I do this is a great deal especially if u consider they come with two real Paris trucks.

One of these should be adequate for most people as it will be 150% the power of the two smaller I've been selling 

The nitrile rubber for these will be here before these motors arrive in a month

@Hummie Can you remind what size spanner wrench is required to open up these motors or if there is another way using normal tools? I think my little ducted cooling experiment forced some extra road crap into my motors and I've got a little grinding going on.

Great, let me know on the $200 immediate option if you want to clear inventory.

Yes the next model sounds most interesting. Not sure I am visualizing these, 110mm long means what size contact patch?

Be best if u brought them to me as I have the tools and the high heat retaining fluid. 
The two pin spanner ud need ...I only have one but they're pretty easily gotten.   I forget the hole size on the threaded ring but if you measure and get it they're cheap. 
Get the ring off. Then press the stator out.  Clean the inside out with duct tape. Scratch and cleanthe retainingfluid off the bearings. Add more.  Slide it together and lock down the ring with loctite again

Long contact patch.  Should be smoother.  So like a 110mm contact patch. 

Not sure if I have the aluminum motors still.  Or at least I'm not sure if they're all accounted for.

At this point Ive got only 8 of the experimental biggie motors coming and they will be here in likely a month.   I think they might all be accounted for already as I offered them to people who already had gotten motors before.  After these motors and the new rubber are tested I will likely organize a group buy as if we get to 20 we can discount it by 10$ each motor.  It costs me 235$ after all expenses for one motor and rubber and a set of paris trucks and that's not including the two steel rubber molds I just had made at 650$ .  Was going to offer them for 300$ each or 525$ for two.  If you want in email me to humminashadeeba@gmail and I might have one or two of these first eight but after they are gone it'll be another month manufacturing time.  Pretty quick.
