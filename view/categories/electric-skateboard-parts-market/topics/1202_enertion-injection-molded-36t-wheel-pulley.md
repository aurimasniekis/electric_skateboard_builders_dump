When building the Raptor completes I realised screwing 6 bolts into each wheel to mount the wheel pulley really sux! Doing one or two wheels isn't too bad, doing 50 takes forever. see.

The normal installation has many steps: slightly drill out the wheel core, partially insert the bolts one-by-one, keep checking the pulley is seated, further tighten the bolts, check that everything is concentric, put thread locker on each bolt!~

**So I designed a new wheel pulley, its injection molded using a composite of nylon and glass fiber.**

This is the final product! All enertion Kits will come with this now.

**BENEFITS OF NEW DESIGN.**
**1. Super fast, fool proof installation**
**2. Works with Enertion PowerWheels & ABEC Flywheels**
**3. Much cheaper to manufacture, Mounting kit price reduction now possible.**
**4. Half the weight of Aluminium Pulley.**
**5. Integrated Flange Bearing Guarantees perfect alignment & Minimizes load on wheel bearings.**
**6. No screwing bolts! No Tools needed!**

Does it need to have a slightly longer axle to fit the extra bearing? 
I've got some abec pulleys I bout and am now selling that are very similar to those. They were intended to have a slightly longer axle I guess lathed but from what I read they sit where they should if u omit the bearing and just rely on the mount or belt tension.  Never tried them though.   Definitely an improvement in design!

Unfortunately, the axle of a normal truck doesn't have room for a wheel and the extra bearing inside the pulley. You need to remove 7mm from the hanger. Or just buy trucks from enertion that come with the correct axle length.

I also think you can modify a normal truck hanger quicker with a hacksaw & file than you can screw 6 bolts into the wheel & aluminum pulley.

Interesting.
I like the idea of a bearing in the pulley, it makes a lot of sense.

How do these wear compared to aluminium ?

that's my biggest concern too- I guess though since you can buy like three of these for the price of one aluminum one, it wouldn't be horrible to replace.

The concept of a bearing in the pulley seems to make it just plug-and-play, which is great

for what its worth @trbt555 @cmatson I find that after hundreds of kilometers its the smaller motor pulley that tends to wear most.

My current recommendation is steel for the motor pulley and glass reinforced nylon for the wheel pulley.

I tend to think aluminium is just a bit soft, it eventually wears out. definitely no aluminium for the motor pulley as it has 3 to 4 times the amount of belt contact per tooth when compared with wheel pulley.

Nylon is extremely abrasive resistant especially with glass fibres

That should help mitigate at least some damage from the wheel pulley rubbing on the motor mount's length adjustment bolts in the event that the mount shakes loose. I've seen pretty severe gouging when that happens, especially when there's any sort of wobble in the wheel pulley. I've got some on my bench right now that look like somebody took a grinder to them.

On the really off chance that I can find calibers with longer axles, whats the axle length needed here? I notice you have 12mm and 9mm wide, any plans for 15mm? Its overkill, but on a 12t to 36t overkill is def advised IMHO.

EDIT: I see in another post that the 15mm wide pulley would cause too many problems, between having to get a longer axle and the space lost to put the motor mount itself it seems at this time its unfeasible to get this out of a injection molded setup.

[/quote]

spray paint would work really well honestly.. especially with it being a plastic based pulley. 

think about it: just adding one color would add a whole other set of things he'd have to keep in stock, and each order would have to be double checked to have the right pulley- 

it seems like more of a pain than what's it worth (from a business standpoint) when you can spray paint it black and still have the rest of the can left over for the enclosures of your ninja board.

@cmatson I see your point, but part of business growth is to identify customer demand and then respond to it. This is especially true as a business grows! @onloop is one of the most savvy designers in esk8, I'm certain that he could produce parts in multiple anodized or plastic colors and manage the blue\black\silver options in the ordering process.

## \#27 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-02-25T22:09:14.043Z Reads: 260

```

the problem with colour ways is mostly due to cost, warehousing & fulfillment.

each colour is essentially a completely unique product.

So for example, if i offer black trucks (which i personally think is a good colour and I would like to make a stealth-blacked-out raptor one day) It would require me to order twice as much stock, most of my factories have minimum orders.

Then i also need to setup my software & warehouse for more skus. This also has costs...

it also means that orders can be sent wrong, someone orders black but get blue sent due to human error.

For my business to grow and be successful it needs to be very simple, very lean & efficient. KISS.

this is the reasons many of my competitors will not grow bigger than they are, because they will try to do more then the can achieve. It's a very fine line and you cannot please everyone.

For me its all about branding. The blue is Enertion as it builds its name more as more ppl are seen with the parts on their boards. More choices may come, but as @onloop says its about control of output and hes not ready for it yet.

20-25 minutes with a dremel cutting wheel and sanding drum if you want it clean and professional. 

I just did this for a 33 tooth Evolve pulley that can take a 15mm belt and is still compatible with enertion mounts if you run one fat motor with a longer shaft to accommodate a motor pulley that wide. 

Here's what I did on YouTube. It's also on my Instagram

This would totally work with the new enertion pulleys of course when using your own caliber ii trucks.

What about motor shafts that can support 12mm pulleys? Do the 6374s already have these? i assume you're using them on the mono raptors so i was expecting to see all those parts show up on the site. 

Sorry i just keep thinking of shit 5 minutes after i post, but all this is nothing new. I've been wondering about all of this since the aluminum bolt-thru wheel pulleys vaporized from the site abrubtly forcing me to get out of my chair and poke around for alternatives. I even downloaded FreeCad and started trying to learn it.

if you have non-R-SPEC motors you can file a flat spot on shaft & create a small wedge from the key and hammer it in for a super permanent pulley fitment. no cir-clips or set screw required.

On the R-SPEC motors it is simply held in place with the Key & cir-clips. bit of thread lock on the shaft helps to tighten up the fitment and reduce rattle.

i could have drilled & tapped hole in the teeth, but its just not needed.

as you mentioned the other option is a longer shaft... but that just complicates things at my motor factory.

I did something very similar with your 9mm pulleys on a set of NTMs a while back. It did work pretty well for a while until i decided to get rid of the keys and use the set screw alone on a flat spot. This sounds like it might be worth making a video about.
