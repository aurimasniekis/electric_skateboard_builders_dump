```
* 1 new, one used. 
* Used vesc was run in bldc/never used FOC (my personal preference.. They are FOC capable) 
* never used canbus

These controllers are on par with the focbox/may even be superior due to components with higher voltage tolerances.

* SMD2220 with 15uF / 100v compared to 63v (focbox/vesc6) 
* 14x SMD1206 with 4.7uF / 100V as opposed to 9x (focbox) 

Both for 250 Euro, excl. shipping. Not sold separately.
