ALL SOLD> CLOSE please

Have a few things to sell. Will trade for the arduino spot welder
***************************************************************************
First is the koowheel 97mm drive train. Front and back trucks with 2 extra sleeves. Front wheels don't have bearings. I put the on my abec 107s but should cost less than 10 euro

Looking at 125 euros plus postage
