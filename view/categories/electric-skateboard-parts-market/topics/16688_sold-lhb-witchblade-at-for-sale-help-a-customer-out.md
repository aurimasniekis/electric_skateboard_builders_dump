Highly customized Withchblade AT for sale. This is an excellent commuter board. The story behind this is kind of tragic, actually. I don't give refunds for builds that i've already shipped as a rule. Instead, i fix whatever is wrong with it and usually pay for shipping both ways. That's the level of service I aim to provide, as a rule. 

However, this particular custome is under threat of being kicked out by his mom who thinks this board is a rolling death machine. Which, of course it is in fact a rolling death machine because i only build scary fucking over powered boards that put the fear of Skatan in you. But because his mom is threatening to street his face, along with the rest of him, we agreed to a partial refund and I am posting this board here for sale to help recover the loss. 

TOP SPEED: around 30mph depending on rider weight (15/38 ratio on 100mm wheels at 12S assuming 80% efficiency, seems to line up with reality)

RANGE: around 25 miles if you keep it at or under 20mph. I got 23.4 miles out of it while intermittantly taking it up to 27mph+ and averaging 19mph over the entire run. 

SPECS:
12S4P 430 watt hour lithium ion pack, charger included
100mm MBS All Terrain UNSTOPPABLE wheels
BONES REDS racer builtins bearings. 
Twin ENERTION R-SPEC 6355 190 KV motors
15/38 pulley ratio
280mm HTD5 9mm belts, i will include spares
Caliber trucks, 50 deg
Enertion motor mounts
LHB Witchblade AT deck with custom paint, 9ply rock maple, i pressed it myself
Crushed SKYY Vodka glass grip
Heavy duty commercial grade fiberglass enclosure
graph and percent readout for battery pack charge
silicone sealed, splash and puddle resistant
2.4GHz Steeze thumb stick style remote
Warranty goes with the board, not the customer, so you get the LHB treatment. 


I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED THIS BOARD BACK FROM THE CUSTOMER, BUT DUE TO HIS URGENCY I'M POSTING THIS A LITTLE AHEAD OF TIME. I EXPECT TO RECEIVE IT WITHIN 10 DAYS. 

**I'll take $1800 for this build as is, or full price ($2300) if you want new wheels, gear ratio, and paint job.** 
If sold AS IS, I can ship it immediately upon receiving the board and payment. 

I JUST built this board. It literally shipped last week. He just got it and rode it a few times but its very low miles, and will fucking climb a tree with the torque it puts out. 

Yes, its white. Yes I will clean it up before i ship it. Yes, white gets dirty. ITs nothing some windex can't handle. 

RELEVANT SKATE PORN
This is the very board in question:

He sent me a picture of a red white and blue Honda motorcycle and asked me to make it look like that. So I came up with this, which looks kind of All American and kind of brutally tribal. 

brutally tribal american muscle boards. Maybe I should put that on a shirt.

I'm sorry to hear that. You should've just done white and blue and skipped the red, everybody knows what red does to vehicles, even moms.

The AS IS is a good deal. Its $500 off full price and the warranty will be extended to the new owner. I'm also going to go over it with a fine tooth comb and make sure nothing's going on with it before i send it back out.

I have confirmation that the board shipped. It will be back in my hands in a few days. 

This is a good deal and it will only last until i get another order for one of these at which point it will be stripped down, re-finished,  and re-customized as a new board. 

At the moment i have 7 people in my waiting list so there's no shortage of demand. 

Man up and take advantage of me while you can.

somebody was asking about top speed and range, so i updated my original post with that info.

There are a couple of interested parties already, so if you're interested, let me know before it's gone.
