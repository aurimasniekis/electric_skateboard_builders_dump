Planning on having a few of these in August - curious if any euro peeps are interested in purchasing - they will be cheaper as I'm buying in bulk and getting rid of import fees, cause i pick them up while in the  states. Help give me a feel for how many I'm packing.

* waiting to hear back from ENERTION and others-@Okami Update - I am thinking these will run euro peeps 115 euros each plus shipping.........willing to drop the price  if I get a shit ton of interest ~ 40
 
AGAIN NO IMPORT TAX FOR EU BUYERS AND GROUP BUY DISCOUNT

Line starts here gentlemen.

Much love,
Hunter

all depends on the VESC6 development until then - nobody knows what the new enertion focbox based on VESC6 will look like and cost or when it will be available.
I'd hold off on buying a VESC right now - exciting times ahead ;)

At what price do u think u would get these? 

I saw one being sold for 120Eur, so if you can get to that price that would be great.. though im pretty unclear about my own plans concerning vescx / vesc but it is always nice to have some options to choose from :P

Naw bro, the FOCBOX is the new name of VESCX. For at least the next 6/9months I expect to see no 120-35 options of VESC 6 ( I signed up for the first beta run so I will be supper pissed if this happens) I want to compare the two, and provide euro brethren with a reasonable option that is better than the 4.12 which seems delicate.....VESCX or FOCBOX seems to handle power/foc mode better and to be pretty reliable - I'm bringing them to the mass at a more reasonable price was the idea.

I was looking at getting a big batch brought in for EU/UK.
Were you thinking of a handful or a suitcase?
I think they look like a great unit, quite robust with the outer shell rather than the old style guts on show!

i know that the focbox is currently the VESC X - but that will change as soon as the new version is out and jason will make sure to adopt the changes quite quickly (that is my guess at least).
We have no clue if the focbox v1 will still be available until then, which is why I said you should not plan that far ahead with so many things going on right now with the new version.
If it still is in August and you can actually get them to Europe for around 120€ that would be pretty cool though.

depends on interest 
i had in mind 20-25 but this is sort of the thread i wanted to start to get a feel for interest. More obviously being better for everyone.

Ok, the FocBox topic is going in all topics almost now..

but I think it is hard to speculate at what price VescX might arrive here, I think Enertion itself sold them for 140Eur.. so maybe 130Eur might be more 'reasonable' since someone has to ship them / bring them to Eu.

120Eur is a price I saw someone who had bought it but never used and wanted to pass it on, so there was some sort of 'depreciation' like with new cars :D

Maybe you both can open seperate topics haha, if you need to expand on this :D

.. What is your estimate, for how much you gonna be able to bring the price down?

I dont think you might get it down drastically.. but it might be about to what terms you get while speaking to Enertion (assuming you gonna get it from Enertion)

YEah but you are forgetting a couple things

1. There was no free shipping unless you got like 250 of merch and shipping from AU is a bitch
2. Import taxes to europe suck balls - near 20% in Spain at least


3. They are produced stateside......so export taxes is a big hurdle that I avoid bringing them over in my luggage. I don't have a for sure price yet, but I assume at 20+ units they would run 120- 135

yeh, even at 135eur price since they are a bit 'ŗare'' here in europe, they would still be okay I think! Everything is better than 145 Eur a piece :D _/From price perspective/_

@monkey32 would be cool if u did update this thread with new details if you are still bringin them to eu, and can offer competitive prices.. I think that is what greatly influenced US group buy for them

Alright kids, I'm about to boat around Seward,AK. I will do a Google form tomorrow. Anyone else that wants these, send me a PM. If you already have sent a message, assume I have it and check back tomorrow to check that you are on the form. I already have 8 people expressing interest so this buy is looking like it's gonna happen. Be back tomorrow with an update.
