Just figured I would shoot out a quick post to see if anyone happens to have a motor mount, wheel pulley, motor pulley, and belts they aren't using. I saw a couple posts but haven't gotten any replies to private messages inquiring about it. I'm using the 97mm abec clones and caliber trucks. Let me know if you guys have anything you aren't using.
