I can make it with different colors incuding: Blue, Red, Copper, Gold, Silver, Green, and Purple. Normal Carbon Fiber would be cheaper. I can also do it without Carbon Fiber if you like the wood look.

Cost per unit would be $275 Usd.

If you wanna try and build it yourself here is how I did It.

I'm still trying to figure out details like shipping costs, but I don't want to get to involved if no one wants it.
