Debating over offering Samsung 30Q cells for purchase on our website as another option for those who want to build their own packs.

We would offer them at the same price as IMR. We would only be shipping within the USA.

Would this be of any interest to anyone? Is there any other cells anyone else would prefer?

Buy 12 or above and pay only $5.50 each
Buy 24 or above and pay only $5.25 each
Buy 36 or above and pay only $5.00 each
Buy 50 or above and pay only $4.75 each
Buy 100 or above and pay only $4.50 each
Buy 200 or above and pay only $4.25 each
Buy 400 or above and pay only $4.00 each

Great cells.  I'd also look at the VTC5a's as 25A continuous cells.  One of Mooch's favorites lately and guy knows his 18650's (and others in general)

Definitely sell them and nickel strips. Maybe even a arduino  spot welder kit or something.

I would like it but why would you do this out of curiosity? Would you buy in bulk then sell at those prices to make a little bit of profit on each cell? Why would someone buy from you instead of IMR? Just to save on shipping if they are buying more then one product?
