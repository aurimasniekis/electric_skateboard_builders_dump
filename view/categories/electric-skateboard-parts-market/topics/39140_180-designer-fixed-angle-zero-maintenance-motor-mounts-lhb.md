I have six sets in stock ready for retail after setting aside the ones for my two current builds in progress, trying one set out for a few months, and giving Jake a set to further abuse until they die. If anyone can cause them to fail its him. 

https://longhairedboy.com/products/fixed-angle-motor-mounts-for-63mm-motors-on-caliber-ii-trucks

These are the mounts i'm using from now on. If you want a mount you can install once and never have to worry about again, this is it. I've had people tell me the hanger will break before the mount will budge if installed correctly. 

They were designed in Paris by UNiKBOARDS (@okp) and i've been using a trial set for a few months now. I've already bragged and bragged about how they take a ridiculous beating all over the intarwebs, so i'll leave that for other posts. 

Anywho i'm making them available so you don't have to order a complete board to get them. 

What's different about these vs the ones UNiK is selling? The crossbar is longer to accommodate sensored Maytech 6355s, which are slightly longer than the unsensored maytechs he's running. Also they have my name on them which instantly adds 30% more performance, and good thing too because these are black and not red.

Clean me out quick and i can order more and create a mount and motor bundle that will save peeps some money on both. As of now i don't have enough mounts to set aside for a variant. 

BTW all these pics were taken with my phone on a peice of posterboard and shopped for product white. If anyone wants tips on doing that, i've been doing it for a while and know a few shortcuts.

How thick are the mounts in the front section and how thick in the rear?

6mm thickness at the motor, 12mm at the crossbar area, and at the extrusions for the hanger 21mm total. Total length of the mount is 126mm, and maximum width is 50mm with a slope down to 46mm before the curve. 

Crossbar is 4mm by 15mm not counting the bolt hole extrusions at the ends. The crossbar bolt holes are countersunk for machine screws but i opted for m3 socket cap bolts instead last minute to mitigate the whole head stripping thing those screws do. Also the next iteration of the crossbar will likely have a half-height counter sink for socket cap bolts instead of the bevel type for machine screws. 

distance between maytech 6355 sensored motor can nipples is ~1mm.

This one was the most interesting aspect of this mount. Nicely done. I'm also planning on putting crossbars (rods) to my future mounts. Your rectangular crossbars  gave me some ideas. On the other hand, you played to tight the motor nipple separation. Quite a gamble with the mm.

I thought about mentioning my thoughts on that gamble in my original post, but decided not to. However, i will say that its not really that big of a gamble once you realize that they simply don't creep at all when properly installed. And the 7075 at that thickness isn't going to twist. 

However if things do get interesting i'll add another 1mm in total legth to the crossbar and ship everyone new ones. 

Or i could shave my nipples. Should i shave my nipples?

Show me my beloved Witchblade GT (but not those green ugly bchs!). Is the one with the red edge, black deck, white grip and black MBS 100s. I could not find the images in the net anymore. :tired_face:

this one?

the grip is actually clear but from an angle you can see the whiteness of the collective grit. Not something that happened on my glass grit. The substrate is clear but i question the clarity of the grit.

the Witchblade GT/AT crossovers are a mad beast. I'm basing my first run of designer boards on them to be released spring of 2018. We'll build five at first, then when they sell out we'll build five more, and do that until it snows again in Canada. Same specs, just a more elegant and contemporary paint job to offset the pant shitting power on the street. They'll be street builds on Popocas with a new box design and a few other mostly aesthetic modifications.

Depends on what you want. You can build one here. Aesthetics are addressed privately via email or text after you build and purchase to your performance spec.

Exactly like this one. Perhaps without so much white grip. I would like more black in the deck. Red & black, great combination.

184mm. If There's a 210mm Caliber II  aside from Torqueboards', i'd love to see it.

Yeah those aren't caliber IIs, they are Torqueboards extended trucks. Nothing wrong with them, but the aren't caliber IIs...

I'm expecting a set any day now my expectations are that they would be in a quality par with regular calibers just longer...but hey what about using the torqueboard truck to the rear and a regular caliber up front....that my friend is the question

Iâ€™m curious, if you truly want mounts that wonâ€™t move, why not just weld a quarter inch think steel mount to the trucks? Itâ€™d be pretty cheap and would never move

aluminum rings would be the ticket there. 

because then i'm stuck with a bunch of identical trucks with only a single application to fulfil. Part of my mission is to use off the shelf, known solid components and genuine unadulterated Calibers IIs are part of that. 

Also i'd have to have them stripped and refinished, which means either setting up dedicated paint and bake stations or anodize stations. 

and i also wouldn't be able to sell mounts that you can use on any caliber II you want. limited editions, gold editions, gorgeously anodized or painted trucks in so many flavors already to match the customer's aesthetic desires.
