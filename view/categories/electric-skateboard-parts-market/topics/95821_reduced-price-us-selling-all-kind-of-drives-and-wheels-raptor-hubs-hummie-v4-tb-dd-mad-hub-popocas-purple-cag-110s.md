Selling these off because I bought too many things to try out and no enough decks in the market to complete artisanal build. And basically I have found the best out there in the market.

Drives:
* [Sold] Raptor 2.1 Hub Kit with extra baseplate (($300, OG price $580)
  * lightly used ~150miles, comes with extra sleeves
  * pros: powerful and comfortable ride
  * cons: avg urethane, inefficient
  * reason for selling - see cons

* [SOLD] Rare Hummie V4 hubs ($450) 
  * lightly used ~200miles, comes with slightly used baseplate, new Centrax wheels at the front
  * pros: best hub on the planet, wide CP, great ABEC formula urethane, 83mm wheels
  * cons: 83mm wheels, 75kv tops at 30 with 12S, no sensor
  * reason for selling - had @hummie made me custom 85kv that are superior.
 
* Madhub 90mm 75 or 135 kv (~~$300~~$250)
  * barely used, experimented with them, comes with front trucks, with 4x 90mm popocas and 2x extra  sleeves
  * pros: decently powerful hubs, @rey8801 Direct Drive Upgrade, cheaper
  * cons: wheel sleeve more durable than Raptor but less grip and need to break them in 
  * reason for selling - i have better stuff
  * SPECIAL: bought them 135kv but I can re-terminate them to 75 kv


* TorqueBoard Direct Drive 4WD 90KV  (~~$1100~~$1000 w/ TB 110 big wheel):
  * barely used ~20 miles on one pair of drives, comes with both sets of ABEC and KEGEL adapters
  * pros: 90kv 4wd for maximum speed and torque, made by @torqueboards quality drives
  * cons: need to use them with big wheels, 107s and 110, maybe boas if you can even find them
  * reason for selling - realized I dont like big wheels also no long have a vision to use them 
  * OPTIONS: you can get two front trucks from TB for $179 and split the price with someone

Wheels:


* [Sold] Purple Caguamas ($50)
  * NEW
* [Maybe] Shitty Chinese clone 83 flywheel. (Free you pay for shipping, get them out of my sight)
* [Added to direct drive combo] TorqueBoard 110 ($100) 
  * preferably sell with TB DD since they are already on them.
  * 10 miles on 2 of them

Random stuff:

* a pair of super old Torqueboard 6374 with cut motor shaft ($100 for both)
  *  need replacement shaft and better magnet glue


* Marc's mount with aluminum idlers and crossbar 168mm cross bar **WITHOUT hanger clamp** (paid $150, now $100)
  * originally planned for SR 200mm pressfit but a bit short to clear SR pivot cup
