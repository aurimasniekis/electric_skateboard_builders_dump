Really like this new super-flat Li-Ion battery. I really find superior in many aspects than LiPo solutions. The energy density is unbeatable and now the costs make the best choice. Just I wonder what cells are inside? :smile: 
Is there planned a 10s4p for the future?
And NCA cells also for the future?
Thanks for sharing!

Hey Nobuo, 

This current batch is using LG he2 depending on market prices & cell availability we may switch between using that cell & The Samsung 25r. The configuration will remain the same in 10S3P as we are building a system around this form factor. 10S4P in my opinion becomes slightly too long and forces the rider into using longer wheelbase decks.

We are developing a "booster" pack option, probably a **10S1P &/or 10S2P** modules that sit on top of the deck in a discrete aluminium housing & plug directly it into the SPACE Cell boosting your Amp Hours by 30% to 60% more...

I say you switch to Samsung 25R. LG cells are good but the Samsung 25R seem to be a much better chemistry.

Sweet packs! Gotta get me some of my own! lol

25R performance is basically identical to he2

Also my supplier has a good deal on he2 now. Good prices and good consistant supply.

25R supply is sketchy at times causing price spikes.

I am used to wait a lot for things to arrive when I order parts from around the world, but I have to admit that the SPACE Cell shipment was the fastest ever! 

It took only 3 days for an oversea shipment with DHL Express and tax handling was covered too. Given the fact that shipment costs are included in the price of the battery this is just amazing!

It really is a good deal and greatly simplifies the entire build and user experience. I'll most likely be using these in all but my most exotic builds because it eliminates the cost of the charger while providing plenty of power for both speed and range, placing the resulting eboard build in a very cost effective yet high performance niche. The deck i'm in the process of putting together was designed around its measurements: plenty of wheelbase and a nice wide flat spot on the bottom. 

My only complaint (and really its not much of one) with the space cell is the number of options you have for power display, power switch, and charge port placement. Its precisely two unless you hack the pack to break everything out for case mounting. However, I don't see that there's really any solution to this and the way it is currently set up is as optimal as we can hope for given what it is. I suppose you could have ports on the pack and keep the switch, plug, and display as separate components, but that would just add to the cost of the product which works very well as is.

How does the space cell handle board flex? Since the space cell is large in surface area it would take up most of the bottom of the deck, how would you mount it on a decently flexy deck?

Questions:
Why is it the on/off button and charging port located at the bottom of the pack? 
Wouldn't had been safer to build them on the side, so less exposed? 
Has anyone experienced any of those issues?
Is there any way to change that configuration?
My concern is that those 2 are really exposed to rocks, water and who knows what else while riding,
Thank you in advance

i had the same questions. But if you look at the way @onloop has his configured in his carbon fiber deck it sort of makes more sense. He flipped the battery over and drilled holes in his lid so that the power switch, port, and meter are exposed on the top and not the bottom. 

Of course that doesn't help the rest of us with regular decks. My plan is to hack the pack a little and break out the volt meter, switch, and charge ports so i can mount them in the more usual locations: on the outside of the box where i can see them and use them without cracking open the box all the time. 

I like the idea of the volt meter peeking up through the deck where I can see it while riding  though, so I may do that at some point. Somehow.

.....that makes total sense, I wasn't aware of his carbon-fiber deck configuration till now.
That would be nice, if you were able to hack the pack a bit and move those ports around, also 
having the volt meter on top would be a big plus. I though about some of those led meters, they are smaller and flatter of a normal voltage meter, so easy  to stick on top of the deck, just drill a small hole for the wires and thats it.

I would prefer that the buttons, meter, and charging port were dongled using connectors and not wrapped into the pack, personally. I should be able to put those wherever I want. I still prefer the side of the box for charge ports and power buttons.

Yeah basically what @longhairedboy  said.

The components are actually on the top of the battery. However you can install anyway you want.

I personally think there should be no open holes or parts beneath any esk8 deck....too much gunk gets splattered up from the ground.

I could seperate those components into a seperate unit that is tethered to the battery by a single cable with a plug on the end. Then you could mount it anywhere on the deck. But it would end up making the total pack price rise by $60 or $70

If anything I probably need to make my products cheaper... not more costly.

Soon I will have a range of wood & carbon decks in different shapes and sizes (I currently sell the carbon deck seperatley too) that have a special components housing built into it. I am working hard to keep the prices low so it is a viable choice to pair it with other enertion components.

Also Ive noticed  that is a 10S, would it work with an ESC rated to max 8S with a 6364 245kv ourunner motor, or is it just meant for a 10s rated ESC?

yep, I wouldn't recommend taking it apart thought unless you are completely sure you know what you are doing... 

it does come with the voltage display, on off switch, and bms for easy charging though.

If there is enough interest, maybe I'll make another thread showing its guts, and how it take it apart; Onloop walked me through it like I said when my space cell wasn't working, but we got it all sorted out. 

**Don't** use it with an 8s esc; it'd be a really bad idea... plus, for 10s voltage, 245kv is kinda high. with 190kv and the esc limited to 80% power, I'm getting close to 23-24mph on 15/36 gearing 83mm wheels.

vesc or torqueboard's esc are you two main options-

Vesc is a little more complicated to set up, but is cheaper and works better with the space cell. It you use torqueboard's esc with the space cell, you have to limit it to 80% or else you will blow the fuse on the battery.

But let's not hijack this thread- so if yo have any other other questions, I'd start a new thread (only after you've used the search bar to try to and answer your question first)

the general idea with the space cell is that is already built for you so you don't have to mess around with mounting stuff, soldering, shrink tubing & designing panel mounts for the various i/o.....  so if your intention is to pull it apart anyway you nearly could just buy the parts separately and build it the way you want it to be.

ALSO NOTE, i'm probably not going to offer much warranty if you do pull it apart.

I totally understand, my was just an idea in order to maximize  space in the enclosure and just to get the charging port on a safer spot since my build would have the pack right at the bottom of the deck,
didn't mean to minimize the great concept of the SPACE.... :sweat_smile:
ALSO I just realize you are the guy running ENERTION lol

I don't see any specs regarding the capacity expressed in mAh, on enertion webpage, any idea?
[/quote]

It's 7500 mAh. Current capacity (mAh) * V = energy capacity (Wh). So for the space cell, I took the 270 Wh and divided by the 36 V nominal voltage for a 10s system. You may already know the following, but it might be helpful for other people trying to figure out the whole battery angle, as well.

Energy capacity is what you really care about, in terms of how far you can travel with a given battery. 5,000 mAh at 6S is not as much energy as 5,000 mAh at 10S. 

You can think of current as the amount of water flowing over a waterfall, and voltage would be the height of the waterfall. Both are relevant to how much (gravitational potential) energy can be converted to electrical energy by a hydroelectric generator, for example. The SI unit for energy is the Joule. Units of power is the Watt (= Joule/sec. a 100W light bulb uses 100 Joules of energy per second). So 270 Wh tells us how much energy is actually stored in the battery. The current capacity (mAh) tells us how long the battery can supply a given current (i.e. 5 amps for 1 hour = 5,000 mA*h), but if it can only supply that current at 3.7 volts, it's not going to be able to do much work. The voltage of the battery system indicates how hard the electrons in the battery can be pushed through your components, creating the magnetic fields, etc, that turn the motors and propel you. 

Anyway, to compare apples to apples, across different battery setups, Wh is best.

good explanation and the analogy makes it even clearer, I was about to come out with a similar question.
So a 10S battery would be more suitable for a dual drive or a single one if lots of torque is required?

## \#33 Posted by: emotiva Posted at: 2015-10-29T04:42:33.056Z Reads: 195

```
Yes, and not only that, but due to other electrical properties, the system actually operates more efficiently at higher voltages (This is why long distance power lines are high voltage - less energy loss in the lines), so you get more work out of that stored energy and less heat generated. What the actual difference in efficiency is, I don't know, but it's a move in the right direction, anyway.

I should say that it is important to choose the motor and battery together to achieve the top speed you want with your gearing and have good torque. A 6S battery will require a higher KV rated motor than a 10S to get the same top speed. These might be useful:

So how did you guys mount your space cell that are using regular decks? I will have to drill holes on the bottom of the enclosure for charging port and on off switch but nothing some rubber grommets won't fix.  I was also think of just some clear plastic glued on for the display on the bottom.
