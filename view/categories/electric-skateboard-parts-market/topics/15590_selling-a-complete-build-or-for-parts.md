Hey people. Im selling my brand new build (about a month old) as a complete or of anyone wants to buy parts then there welcome to.

- 5055 320kv Turnigy Motor
- 3s 5000mah 25c Turnigy lipos X2
- Maytech Vesc
- GT2B modified without a case but fully functional

Think it needs some new grip tape As i went to design a pattern on it and it has big black blobs on there now. Its all in fully working order with only about 30 miles on the clock. Only reason im selling is because i want to build another but seing as im young i dont have a massive income. 

Im not sure on the pricing...if anyone wants to shoot an offer please go ahead! Also i will sell for parts if needed :)

Pretty much any HVAC shop can make something like that for you.  Ive had a couple made, its usually less than $20.00.
