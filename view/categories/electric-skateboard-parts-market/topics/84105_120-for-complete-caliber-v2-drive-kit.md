Switched to Dickyho's 6inch tires a couple months back, and I don't see myself going back to urethane mostly because the weather is always terrible here and I love rolling over cracks.
If however, you have better roads than I do and better weather than Indiana, then this is the kit for you!

Total around 150 miles ridden on this kit.
All the damage is cosmetic, no functional damage.
The wheel pulleys have been bored out slightly to fit over Caliber Trucks, so no need to grind down your precious trucks!
The wheel pulley and mounts look more damaged than they really are, you can blame my impatient spray paint job coming off for that.
The mounts have some scratches roadside since they were mounted pretty close to the ground, but nothing major.
Wheels have tiny cracks in them, the ones pictured are the biggest ones I could find.

What you get:
x2 Caliber Trucks V2 50 Degree Satin Smoke
x4 BKB 90mm 78A wheels
x2 Caliber mounts by Dickyho with Idler pulleys
x4 5M 295mm 11mm belts
x2 5M 36T 12mm wheel pulley
x1 Custom Crossbars made with steel and aluminum
x4 Soft risers (1/4" and 1/8")
x8 1.5" Panhead Hardware
x8 Zealous bearings

Total price new with shipping : $210
My price : $120 + buyer pays shipping
Not willing to part out at the moment as everything is a cohesive unit.
