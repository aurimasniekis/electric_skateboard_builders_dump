Hi everybody,

I am thinking of selling my trampa carver. I have bought it almost a half year ago from a member here on the forum.  The trampa is collecting dust on the shelves so it goes into sale. 

When I received the trampa I saw that it has a broken thread on the back truck.  So I have bought a new truck. This trampa has ride 0km. 

Original it cames with urethane wheels. 

Pricedrop to 600euro That is lower then the price I paid (I also take the loss on the new truck). 

**New price:**
Etoxx Dual Beltdrive Trampa Street Carver - €320
Trampa 35° 15ply SOLID TRAMPA Carve Deck - €195
Trampa street carver pulley - €60
Trampa Bearings - €30
Trampa stickies - €88
Set Trampa Infinity Trucks - €170
Total price: 863euro
