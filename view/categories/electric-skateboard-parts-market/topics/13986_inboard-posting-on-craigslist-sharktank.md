Am I wrong, does that run on only 10 cells?  It sure looks like it on the site. 
The specs state  97 watt hours and Li-ion for the battery and 1600 watts at the motors.  Does anyone else see an impossibility in putting out 1600 watts with so few cells?  And the range at 7-10 miles is the typical bull but not nearly as redicilous as that small battery and that output. 
I imagine they will pass this info off to
The shark tank people as well.  1600\ 36volts= roughly 45 amps.  What cells
will they be damaging into early death after extreme voltage sag with that insane draw per cell?
Maybe if they were at least Li-iron or something safer...its to the point of being unsafe.  No Li-ion battery that small is recommended to discharge that much safely. It's straight up dangerous.  Am I wrong?

They don't even KNOW how much this industry is going to boom in the next 2-3 years. :joy:

65% margin on a $1399 board means they make it for about $490.. Let that sink in

And they didn't cover voltage sag, how misinforming

They have to make money. When you buy in wholesale things a lot get cheaper.

My speculated educated guess. 

ESC and BMS $150
Wheels $20
Trucks $20
Board $80
Battery $100
Motors $80
Controller $20
Miscellaneous $20

Battery $100

Don't they only have 12 cells?

Good point. I'm guessing they pay around $3-$4 per cell. Yeah well, you can easily guess that the board or electronics cost more than I estimated. 

Who knows. I have a feeling that Boosted has a higher percentage.
