If you hadn't left the diy market people would buy them from you, but you did, so stop whining. People want those wheels, regardless of who got them first. No point on choosing another manufacturer just cause they're not the first customer, if that's the best just go for it
(Oh and yeah, I like drama, let's start an argument over these wheels)

wat no. They're kegel style, so they'll fit Kegel pulleys like the Boosted V2. They're not even close to Abec style.

Like so:

No they wont fit an abec pulley. We will carry an adapter set soon but it is very easy to drill a pulley and mount it up if you have access to a good drill press and a set of taps.

As far as "innovation" goes I think it is a good choice to begin standardizing bolt/pin spacing when it comes to hubs/cores. One of the great aspects of traditional skating has always been the ability to swap parts freely. I would like to see more of that in Eskate.

@Surfer  All the credit for these sweet wheels goes to the good folks who make them in California. And cheers to seeing more choices with the same hub pattern in the future!

@onloop  It's pretty common knowledge that Chaka is THE most innovative builder on the scene. Show a little respect, bro!  Can't we all just get along?   :v: :beer:
@chaka Have you ridden these yet? How does the 78A duro ride?

Why did you go with the 78a durometer, as opposed to something slightly softer, like a 75a?

Thanks Daryl but you praise me too highly! 

@baxter I have always preffered 78a over a harder or softer duro.  75a seems to soak up momentum too much, 83a is great... on buttery smooth roads. 78a is a kind of happy medium between the two ends of the spectrum.

There is a story based on Mexican mythology and legend. Popoca was a young warrior who was promised his lovers hand in marriage, Izta, the daughter of an emperor, if he went on to fight the emperors enemy and bring him his head. During the many months of the battle false word was sent of Popoca's defeat and the young princess took her life in despair.  Popoca returned victorious only to find his love in an eternal sleep. He carried her to the top of a nearby mountain hoping the cold snow would wake her. 

This is the tale of two volcanos,  IztaccÃ­huatl and PopocatÃ©petl. Sleepying woman and smoking mountain.

 PopocatÃ©petl means smoking mountain in Nahuatl. Nahuatl is the native language of the Meshika.

I really like @chaka's branding direction. You should ask him what Ollin means. 

Most eskate companies brand like gadget companies: blink, boosted, inboard and so on -- lots of talk about the future of transportation, power, technology, stats, where it's all about mass appeal and not about identity, ancestry and meaning -- it can lack soul.

Friend of mine recently took a set of these on tour in 3 day 120 mile tour of NYC and loved em: 

> Those wheels really are awesome.  They roll really well & stability is very good.  
> They're like a slightly faster version of the 90mm ABEC's in classic formula.  Probably due to the popoca's being 78a vs 75a.  The contact patch is just 1mm higher on the Popocas.

Said a lot of people were asking about them and had difficulty pronouncing the name. Hopefully they're curious and dig; I guess you never know what you can learn from a skateboard wheel.

I have a new set of these wheels still in the shrinkwrap if anyone is interested.  I decided to stick with the Abec11 infrastructure since I don't really have time to make a new wheel pulley

I really need to start posting vids with a little narration so peeps can hear how we pronounce Ollin and Popoca! :laughing: Ollin is similar to gas"oline" or simply "oh-lin" if you don't put the accent on it. 

Great review by Slydog, send him my thanks! That rolling footage, love seeing that strobe effect on video!

they're closer to softer abecs than kegels. They're a better general purpose / GT wheel then the kegel in my opinion.

Holy back from the dead Batman.

I finally was able to try these wheels vs MBS 100m at tires for a limited time until I found out my motor was bad. These are so smooth and grippier compared to the MBS. I'm glad I bought two sets from last year's black Friday.  

@chaka
Not sure if this was asked before but is  there any future plans on making these 97mm or higher?
