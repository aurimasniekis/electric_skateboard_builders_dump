E-boarding is an expensive hobby, and frankly that money spent on parts can and should be used elsewhere in my case.  I have mounts, batteries, enclosures, controllers, pulleys, belts, etc. (new and used). I'll have a proper list with pricing and pictures later. (CONT. US ONLY)

That sucks, but this hobby can definitely turn into a bottomless money pit. Hope you can eventually come back at some point and at least have a budget build to ride for fun.
