I have a new direct drive hub motor (fully customed, CNC'ed). I'll be releasing in the near future still undergoing testing and there will be a beta run before they will be available IN STOCK. A future post will be posted in the future.

I plan on offering a complimentary KEGEL core style wheel in either one of the two sizes below.

Personally, I prefer 100mm as for commuting with 107mm is pretty big/heavy. :muscle: I am open to what people prefer more.

These wheels will be made in the USA and will be BLACK on BLACK.

Please VOTE :smile: Any other suggestions or concerns. Please share!

@Apolo I assume your referring too similar to kegels.. I was thinking less lip but it's still something around 61mm contact patch which is much larger that Kegels so it would still be much more grippy.

I'm interested in the direct drive nice.

Also wheel Duro should be 75,  78 is too hard and anything in the 80s is garbage imo. If 75 was an option I bet that would be number one in the votes and you would have a hot seller.

I can't wait to see what you have coming in the future

108mm x 74mm would be better, and make it thin-lipped so it's lighter.  It's the width that makes it go over railroad tracks and obstacles much better, especially if the lip is flexible

Or even 103mm x 74mm if you gotta

113 mm should be awesome. I never found information about these :point_down: wheels and the board (kiteboard), a D-EX, apparently made in the UK. Always thought they were the coolest wheels ever but don't know neither the brand nor the size (??)....

Pretty much 50/50 for 100mm vs 107mm.

I  am mostly going with 107mm 74A and later down the line we'll offer 100mm as well.

new direct drive hub motor

So is this like CarvOn's direct drives? slightly confused by the "hub motor" part.  I see direct drives as  1:1 CarvOn's or 1:1 gears, Hub motors, I just call hub

I feel like direct drive means the motors directly moving the wheel with no transmission. Now the Hub is the wheel and Carvon is the motor directly moving a wheels so it's confusing.

But most of the members consider carvons direct drive and gear drive not, because it has transmission gears and the ratio is not 1:1 :)

Carvon-style are not hub motors because the motor is not the wheel hub.

Carvon-style are direct drive.

Gear drive system like @Nowind E-Toxx system are not direct drive.  Using those words is just marketing to try to sell more. 

These things are all easily searchable online.  There is no need for confusion.

I've had chunking on the Black 107s too. The greens are pretty good but still get tears. I generally just am not sure about the reflex formula.

Ok in my design class I remember that there was simple rule about colors. Warm, cold and neutral. This matter is so subjective that I believe that we should focus on neutral colors here and those are not pretty but will fit to every color scheme build.
Neutral colors are black, white and grey. Black are affected by pigments in my opinion, white is nice but will be white for like first two minutes so this leads to why not make them gray @torqueboards ?

To add a little color you can think of some cups on the hubs that can be color anodized and you have a winner :)

I will suggest Electric Blue on Black hubs? Also, I'm partially with Alan when he suggest....

Well, boa has the 100mm kegel core wheel covered, nobody has a 107mm kegel core covered. BB riders in particular might want even more speed than 100mm boas offer, which might sell more, if the vote is 50/50

...another suggestion, Pink 62 CP 107 mm Electric Flywheel was never properly modified for esk8 use because the wide patch (they never tried to create a dedicated sprocket wheel pulley for their deep rooted hub) ... Why? :face_with_raised_eyebrow: if it was the ideal wheel for such a convertion? so...

...instead, ABEC decided it was easier to shave 11 mm out of the inside wheel face on the newer 107 mm Superfly (??) thus, producing a slimmer wheel with shorter CP an unwanted (and not predicted) side effect over the remaining 90° razor sharp flat surface, now, the main culprit for the chunky derby experienced by the new Superfly line throughout the esk8 universe.

They never understood that the Pink 62 CP 107 mm was always the esk8 perfect candidate because its Contact Patch and its particular profile with rounded lips effectively prevented chunking alltogether. :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

TB wheel atempt should learn something from the Pink 62 CP 107 mm Electric Flywheel no-chunk rounded lip profile qualities.

Haven't updated but we're testing out 110x65 with same Kegel Offset. Also have a new pulley for it which I think you guys will like better.

I wanted as much contact patch as possible.

![image|350x295](upload://j09jX39dfb3NjgMy5FzIs1iW5yA.png)

Mostly, black will be the option but was thinking of another option which haven't decided yet.

The rounded lip does look like a great idea though. I'll have to think about that when the samples come in. Definitely don't want them chunking. :cry: Will be testing them when they come in.

Actually would be a decent idea.. I can get the entire 65mm CP. :smile:

I don't know if I am in the minority or not here, but one of the main reasons I don't buy wheels is because I am worried that the formula will suck. I know Otang formula is good. I have ridden classic abec and reflex thane for years. I have picked up a few other sets of wheels I have either heard good things about or from companies who's wheels I've ridden before and enjoyed.

Can you give us any details as to the urethane formula you plan on using and it's riding characteristics compared to other big wheel offerings?

Also, I just want to throw it out there, I know it won't be possible to make it center set due to the wide CP you're going for with kegel cores, but I hate offset wheels. I've always found offset wheels to drift more unpredictably compared to the same wheel center set, they wear down like cones instead of being easily flipped for even wear, and to go with the unpredictable drifts I find they don't grip as well as the same wheel center set. This may just be me, but this has been my experience with offset cores over the years. I'll still buy offset because there are lots of good offset wheels, but if there is a compatible option for center set, I'll always choose that over offset when buying.

@skatardude10 Made in the USA in the same factory as Kegels. We'll modify the formula if it's not to our liking (everyone's liking). They will be softer 74A-75A wheels. Haven't finalized on the formula yet should be getting some samples soon.

Yeah, if we could I wouldn't want the offset too but unfortunately we don't really have a choice. By making them center set you'd need longer trucks or axles to accommodate.

I find 218mm Trucks already long enough lol. I really wouldn't want any longer.

Here's an update...

They are huge… Will be black though with black cores. May have a second color option.

110mm diameter x 65mm contact patch.

Few changes though. Will round out the front lip and small rounded edge on the rear lip.

Will test the wheels first. Also have some beefier 36T Pulleys for the new Kegels.

Awesome! 

If i may suggest, since you are doing such big wheels, i would love it if you guys have a 40 or 44T pulley in the making. The black core is fine, but if there's an option for different coloured urethanes like abec clones, that'll satisfy most of the guys looking for the wheel colour of their choice.

@torqueboards you've really got your finger on the pulse of DIY at the moment, appreciate the medium priced options. Keep the quality reasonable and perhaps make the website attack us less with cheap marketing ploys :smile:

Also, about that eu warehouse

I think the final version might be black.  Or blinking purple.  Hopefully black.

I like the bright colors though because then I can see when there's debris or dust on the wheel.... but the public consensus seems to be that black is king

Oh goodness no. Not black. Go deep purple please or some other dark colours but not black. 

Grey works too.

Price for the wheels will be $135.
[/quote] 

Fair compared to other wheels of this size / quality. 

Is there anything you guys can do for international shipping costs? I think I paid $40 shipping for the 218 trucks. I heard if you use ebay to make your shipping labels you can get a really good deal on shipping. I bought a deck on ebay and it shipped for $20 usd and came by fedex. Below is boa 100mm. Granted they will be lighter. SFexpress is cheapest. I know iherb uses SFexpress too. Anyone got any good tips for USA - international shipping?

@lrdesigns - Those are pretty cheap shipping rates. Where are they shipping from? Do you know? I'd have to double check on those.

SFexpress might only be available California to Hong Kong, not sure how wide they cover in the US. The deck I got from TGM skateboards, which is in the mid-west.

Rounded of course. Mold should be in production soon. Just finalizing the last drawings.
