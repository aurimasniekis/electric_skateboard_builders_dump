So I dropped of a 2wd evo all terrain board at the dhl terminal in Stockholm.

The package was suppose to go to a customer in Norway. But it did never leave the terminal i dropped it of at. They have searching for it for 6 days now and every day they report back they didnt find it. So I gues a dhl worker stole it.
The package is 110x45x25cm so its not a small box.. 

So now i have to take my own money to pay for parts and build one because I dont want the customer to have paid and just loose all money for nothing. 
DHL take no resposible and they tell me I have to wait 60 days before they do anything and by that time + ordering parts and build it the summer will be over for the customer.. And after 60 days they will probebly only pay back like 5 000 SEK even if the shipment value was set to the real value 26 500 SEK

So a warning to all that ship stuff: Do never use dhl freight parcel connect, their resposible and service sucks! 

So if you see someone ride this 2wd at board or se any for sale please report to me and I will reward you. 
We only sold 2wd AT to 1 in Sweden and 1 to Czechia but they have not got their board yet.

No security cam footage? I find it hard to believe that something like this is even possible!

I requested this to, but they didn't even reply to it, they just tell me they will look for it in 2 days again, and then 1 time a week and after 60 days they will investigate it..

I had the same thing with a battery (12s7p). The shipping company was dpd. I had shipped it with a insurance (the highest amount at them is 500 euro). After calling them almost each day multiple time. They were speeding up the progress. After 4 months off sending mails and call them. They have confirmed that it was lost. 


So I advice you to call them multiple times. New ask for the office manager. Tell your story ask for a good solution. 

We have in Belgium a government department who looks that each shipping company help their costumers. And try to help costumers when shipping company’s not try to find solutions for the costumers. Maybe you have the same thing in your country

I hope they just misplaced it, sadly these days incompetence by business is common place. Unless you had 'beware killer BioBoards eSK8' written all over it I have some hope its been misplaced!

Yes I hope so to, but they say atleast they have looked for the package 3 times in the terminal and they have no scanning that it lefted it. We didnt put any labels on them because we was afraid somone would steal them.
Its just the customs invoice and shipping label on them.

So sorry to hear this. Crappy for you guys and crappy for your customer. I find it shocking that they take no responsibility whatsoever for the security of your package after taking receipt of it.

years and years ago a UK delivery company lost my 'release day' shipment of 5x Playstation2's for about a week, it was tracked into one place and never left took them over a week to locate the rather large package :)

This doesn't help now, of course, but one of the things people do here is take a photo of the package being handed over to the post office.

I don't think it would have helped anyway. DHL is not denying they received the parcel.

Don't you guys get a receipt stating also the weight of the parcel when you drop it off?

You don’t want a insurance pay on the weight. It is only 5-10euro/kg

## \#15 Posted by: taz Posted at: 2019-05-20T10:44:31.747Z Reads: 190

True.

Most courier companies offer extra insurance which must be bought separately, otherwise they just pay a fixed amount per weight with a max value of 400-500€.

Worth a shot ;)

Yeps, in Belgium we have:
Dpd insurance until 500
Gls: 750
Postnl: 700

And then you have the local postal service. They offer no insurance. They even have stolen some packages that were shipped from  foreign countries. I had called them: “We are not responsible for foreign countries packages”

Same thing might have happened with my TB DD, but with USPS it's been a week and a half and still not scanned, do postal offices keep recording's?

@mackann did you get a receipt?

Me too, I use easy ship, but USPS never scanned it in

USPS response was "we don't scan packages at the post office unless you get a receipt, our packages are scanned at the distribution center"

But your case is much worse though

That sucks. But I'm not surprised. It's such a beauty. I would steal it myself. :smile: 

Just to add my own recent experience with DHL on shipping abroad. About two weeks ago I received a package from Flipsky. They sent me their version of DAVEga for me to give feedback on. They stated the price at $30, which is absolutely fair (they sell it for $35). DHL made me pay ~$40 so that I could receive the package. Don't be wrong. That's no price for the shipping. That one has been covered by Flipsky. That's merely the customs, VAT, and the DHL fee for clearing the customs. The customs clearing fee itself was ~$25, which leaves ~$15 for customs/VAT and that's clearly wrong since packages below 150 EUR are not subject to customs and 21% VAT from $35 is not $15. So they charge a ridiculous fee for something they don't even do correctly. Never again.

BTW, Flipsky reimbursed the fee which I really appreciate.

That can be correct, Here in belgium each item above 21euro, we have to VAT over it. I think it is in the whole europe the same thing.

so 30dollar is 27euro.

27*0.21=5.67 euro 

Administration cost is +-30 euro


total cost: 35.67euro = 39.8dollar

I paid it in CZK. The total was 883.10 CZK. The administration fee was 550 CZK. So that leaves 333.10 CZK for the VAT and that's clearly not right. I assume they calculated it from the price + shipping cost and set the shipping cost pretty high. I haven't paid anything for the shipping though so there's no reason for me to pay the VAT on it. The point is, they charge a lot of money for something they don't even do right.

Yup, is including the shipping cost (which is illegal as this is a service and services are not to be taxed like that. Belgium does this anyway too and simply pays a fine each year to I guess Europe.)

You have to pay VAT for the amount off money that is declared on the package. So you declare on the package the price off the items and the shipping cost. That is how declaration works.

Ah good to know. I always pay VAT on item value and shipping cost. @pjotr47 do you know if you can insure the packages shipped with bpost to US?


I think what happen to @mackann it's just ridiculous. What I do not understand is if you have the receipt from the DHL that they scanned the parcel, how can they not be responsible? .

This made my heart hurt a little :slightly_frowning_face:

I’m really sorry this happened. I would recommend going into the drop off location again. I had a similar thing happen with USPS and they actually let me back behind the counter to help look (I have a good relationship with the people there, so that may have helped). People will be a lot less willing to help over the phone compared to in person.

Well, that one was $30.

Anyway, I think we're going a bit off-topic here. I didn't mean to derail the thread. Sorry @mackann. I hope you can find the board or get a compensation from DHL. This is clearly their fault and they should take responsibility.

Did you read my message. I have already explained how the price was calculated. 


[quote="pjotr47, post:23, topic:94409"]
so 30dollar is 27euro.

27*0.21=5.67 euro

Administration cost is ±30 euro

total cost: 35.67euro = 39.8dollar

This is the reason I usually get my shipments through Fedex (at least they do not s B overhere like our governamental post system).

And CS on the phone just told me to wait...
