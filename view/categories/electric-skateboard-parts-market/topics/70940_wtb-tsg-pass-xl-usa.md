The tittle says it all looking for a new or gently used helmet.....would also consider alternative full face manufactures need XL with visor.

Thanks,

@JLabs did the group buy last time right? 
Think i saw him say it would be $200 each next time if he did another group buy.

I’m thinking after the Christmas rush or next spring I’ll do another. The USA distributor still has low stock on mostly all sizes. They also increased the price on them as well.

I have been looking at these.  Fully customizable which is pretty dope.

Just a quick one Jared. People will be broke after Christmas, soon or right before summer would probably be best for numbers.
