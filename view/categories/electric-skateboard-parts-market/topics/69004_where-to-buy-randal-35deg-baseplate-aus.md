Okay so the one store that had the Randal 35degree base plate in stock is now out of stock and I wanted to buy it this week. Tried buying from Randal directly but they won't ship down under. WHERE TO BUY

@kalebludlow 
Well that just saved me a shitload of wasted time searching all the aus board shops.  Disappointing though.  Did you try everywhere?

Yeah last time I checked all the stores (maybe a month ago) they were all sold out and had been for quite some time

This place is showing them but good luck adding to cart. Unless I'm just being thick.
