I'm having a clear out to make space for the new Hummie build. If you have concerns with pricing please put them into a private message to me rather than turning the thread into a free for all. Thank you.

I am in the UK and would prefer to ship within the EU. Cost of shipping is not included in the prices - we can work that out together.
