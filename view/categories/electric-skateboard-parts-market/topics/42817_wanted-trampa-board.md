Hey all,

I've previously built a few boards, currently riding a 10S6P Dual Vanguard, but I've been wanting to build a mountain board for ages as well. 

Thought I'd just see if anyone is selling a Trampa board, with or without electronics?

I'm based in New Zealand but I have places in both the US and Europe where I can get stuff shipped to then forwarded on to me so you wouldn't necessarily have to deal with international shipping.

Cheers

Here's a couple quick photos of my Vanguard, still needs a little bit of work but I've had no issues at all with flex or bottoming out etc.

I've been meaning to do a build log of it so I should probably get round to that at some point.... PM me if you want more info about the build in the mean time :) 

The Trampa is going to be primarily for off road so I'll have to mount all the electronics on the top of the deck.
