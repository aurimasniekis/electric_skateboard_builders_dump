Okay so I see a bunch of for sale ads and want ads but there isn't a thread that someone can go to if theyre looking to browse thru someone else's old garbage and post their own.  

What i'm thinking is : Everyone has a bunch of old (working) E board stuff that a novice might want.  Or maybe your wife is on your ass about having too much extra junk.  Why not post it on here for someone else's use. 

I'll start off with what i'm looking to buy 
-1 NTM Prop drive motor 270kv. (OR two of the same similar motor)  
- 2 of the same Esc's that still work (not picky about what kind)

-1 NTM Prop drive motor 270kv. (OR two of the same similar motor)
[/quote]

I have a pair of those that i've been using for a little over a year now. The shafts have been notched for keys but i stopped using keys on them and flattened the other side and used bolts on the pulleys, leaving the shafts of these things kind of ugly but still totally usable, and its not like you can see them anyway under the pulley, so who cares. Plus you won't have to do it yourself. 

They both run like champs, and they both have had the shitty 14 awg leads removed and now have 10awg silicone leads on them with 5.5mm bullet connectors. one of the leads got rubbed by the motor can, so its taped up, but no critical damage. 

They're still on my board and i just tore around the neighborhood on them last night. I got two brand new ones in yesterday because i like them so much and wanted new ones. 

$50 and they're both yours, shipping included.

***SOLD***

This is for anyone who wants a cheap 6s esc.. I will test it when I get home from vacation to make sure it is still in working condition. 

Last time I checked everything ran fine including the fan- I just upgraded to the VESC and haven't looked back since. I feel like I make have taken the male PPM cable from it and used it on my VESC, but I can't remember for sure..

Since I don't have the esc on me, here is it on ebay:
 http://www.ebay.com/itm/Hobbywing-QUICRUN-WP-8BL150-Waterproof-150A-Brushless-ESC-For-1-8-RC-Car-Buggy-/311348464059?hash=item487dd089bb:g:zFkAAOSwVZNTlq2b

If it works, I will give it away for $10 if you pay shipping. It's better for someone to actually use it than have it sit and collect dust in my garage...

And no, this isn't a joke!

I also have an original 50mm enertion 245kv motor, but I feel like it is on its last breath, so I won't be willing to sell it to anyone- maybe if you want it for uber cheap we can work something out, but I don't know how much longer its gonna last.

SOLD

I am currently using the 15 tooth pulley with 10mm bore on one of my longboards with no keyway. The grub screws that came on it are large enough diameter to handle the stress.

All I did was take a dremmel and grind some flats/divots where the grub screw contacts on the motor shaft. 

I am 230 lbs and even on a single motor setup with hills I have never had an issue.

SOLD!
----

Here are some pics of the torqueboard's 12s sensored esc (with programming car), 6s esc, and Enertion 245kv motor. 

The TB esc works great, I just have two VESC's and don't need it. For those of you who PM'd me(about any of the items), If the guy with the highest bid doesn't back out, and if no one wants to go higher than him, then it is technically already sold- that said, I didn't have any pics before so I'm still open for offers. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a56faee01adcf0c55329cee3abf5cc490035f978.jpg" width="500" height="500">
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/8efa2cc9c6ff0147fdaaff91c32098fdbade4760.jpg" width="500" height="500">

The 6s esc is in rough condition, but works- it has no servo connector, and the power switch has been cut off and re-purposed. If you wire the two red wires together the ESC will just turn on as soon as it's plugged in. If you buy it, and it gives you troubles within the first week or so, I'm happy to refund you whatever you paid for it.

The Enertion 50mm 245kv motor works fine, but has definitely had some miles put on it. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/aa23d5719e2fc00e9019cfbcbe30c91e85d207bd.jpg" width="500" height="500">

@torqueboards
 It seems like a lot of people in this thread alone are looking for a more affordable 7s-12s capable ESC, and not necessarily a VESC, I assume. So I was wondering if you might be open to the possibility of doing a discounted group buy for your regular 12s ESC's? I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but I wanted to gauge your interest and also see how many people might express their interest in something like this. Personally, I'm on the fence about going with the VESC at this time, and still like the simple plug and play and durability aspects of your ESC. If I could buy one of your 12s ESC's for the same price as a VESC, I would have probably already done it, at least once, maybe more. If nothing else, it would tie me over until my comfort level and supply of the VESC have increased. 

So, if I'm out of line by suggesting this possible group buy, let me know, but if not I'd love to hear what you and anyone else have to say. Thanks!

@barajabali - You would have to select (2) of the Single ESCs for the $20/off each. Unfortunately, if you use the Dual, you'll get $20 off. Either way it comes out to $250 for two.

Why are you buying another charger? Why don't you just use your 8S charger for 6S? It's like buying a car that can go 200kmh and then thinking it was too fast so you bought one that was 100kmh when you could've just used the 200kmh car and gone 100kmh.

Not too worried, just didn't hear from you. Still curious as to why the original owner gave you his order number. Warranties are not transferable. I have to have your name and address match the order number.

If you are hard up don't worry about payment for the cap.

I asked for it in case there was an issue with it he never told me that the warranty wasnt transferable. I Got my card stolen recently so ive been using my paypal but I will definetly pay u back for the cap bro because uve got some of the best customer service ever. And at worst u can consider it a donation to the great work u do. Best customer service ever!!!!!

i guess that depends on how much you weigh. I rode around on the other one that is still in working condition for some time. It wasn't the quickest thing but it did the job. I'm saving it for a smaller penny board/trick deck type build.
