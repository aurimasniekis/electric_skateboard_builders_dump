i can't edit the original thread, it's telling me there's too many user mentions.

maybe that's because i've already added a bunch.

can someone who's not made any edits, please add a link back to this thread?  thank you

what i found was anything linked to outside this board gets much less engagement and eventually gets stranded.  being linked to usernames so people can jump from post to profiles, etc, just works better.

we will find out who is it so before that happens, please fix whatever you've done.

This is about not being ripped off right? This considered, I think the downvotes for Enertion are pretty unfair because its not like theyre gonna screw you over. They just suffer from bad planning and not giving a shit about logistics for too long.

I would like to take a downvote as I have paid and not received what I ordered. Not late but never.

I've down-voted a few (Well actually one) cause my personal belief  of selling a product that's known to fail in certain conditions in which they know it's going to be used. 

And pricing can also be considered a ripoff. As well as CS

Your gonna need to defend that, no one knows what your talking about but my 'feeling' is that you are calling your  opinion a fact, and that's probably not OK.  Also, price cannot be a rip off, if its too expensive dont fuckin buy it.  That's called capitalism.

I swear to god, I will never understand how when someone has a good idea (@thisguyhere and his vendor wiki) there's always so many people that wanna fuck it up.

I think Using Poll to get feedback, is really not the best idea. I think most of the people out there are just going to answer it using personal feeling since they don't need to back out their thought or provide any explanation on why they got good or bad services. 

Also, these guys are all active member of this community, and I think these poll are just throwing everyone into a fire pit. 

I for my part, and I know I gonna be dislike for this, but I found these more insulting than usefull.

Especially because the list is only about well known vendor.

There should exist some sort of scale for rating. 
Above 90%- no worries, Safe
Between 75%-90% - expect minor problems, Safe but proceed with caution 
between 65%-75%- questionable 
Under 65%- Not safe. 

Just an example

[/quote]


This whole poll, no matter what way you slice it, is opinionated. Everyone who voted thumbs up or thumbs down, did so based on their subjective experiences and opinions. I can try to defend my opinion, but others can also argue the opposite. In the end that poll inst going to be any more factual than my own opinion. Just a general consensus rooted in a general opinion.  

And I may even be wrong, I can accept that and change my views accordingly, but as far as I've seen that vendor has that one product that they know fails, and it's fairly easy to see which one i voted down and associate why I did so. My previous comment about it got deleted so It may have been border-lining on vendor shaming. 

And That's where you and I disagree. Prices can be rip off's and just because you have the ability to go somewhere else doesn't mean it's not a rip off. The fact that you have to look somewhere else for another vendor capable of selling it for far less with far fewer resources than you means that the price, as the expression goes, is a rip off. But that leads to another problem:

Everyone has their own definitions of what is and isn't a rip off.

Edit: Oh boy my ass is about to get shredded.

I would suggest that down voting any vendor that you didn't actually buy from is an abuse.  The thing is, I expect people to move past emotions and think using logic and even analytics on occasion.  There is far too many people on this planet that think because you feel something, it must mean something.

there are no doubt legitimate downvotes, that's not the concern.

the pattern i've seen (and others pointed out) is that there were immediate downvotes for newly listed polls by a single person.  so it seems this person is just downvoting any poll that becomes available despite having had any real dealings with the person.

I think there should be guidelines for Voting. Here are some Ideas

1.have you received your Order, If not did you get a refund without Filing a Paypal dispute?

2. Did your Item arrive very late due to the seller's dispatch time?

Persnaly I was Tempted to Vote up the super Lidgit people but I was like Hey I never bought anything from them.

i agree, it's just something had to be done about scammers.  the system is not fool proof, not even close.  but it's something.

agreed.

going forward all new polls will be public and if the seller has any disputes, the voter will have to prove their interaction.

I'm gonna suggest you get the wiki deleted, with all the adderall fueled triggered twits out there that cant separate their desires from their decision making process have essentially fucked it up beyond repair.  

I simply cannot believe that @psychotiller, @longhairedboy or @JohnnyMeduse screwed any body over.  I might not leave them alone with my beer, but I'd leave them alone with my kids and my wallet.

i have no emotional ties to this thing, let's get it deleted if it continues to spiral out of control.

having said that, even with some downvotes, if anyone, as a seller, sees predominatly positive feedback i think it serves as vindication of their good work.

as bara noted, we can look judge it on a scale:


[quote="barajabali, post:19, topic:48511"]

Or rather that exact product? 

And even then people have different logic or rather different conclusions. You and i can argue if the focbox is a rip off just because it comes with 3.5mm bullet connectors, connectors that only one motor use and if you change them , it voids your entire warranty (just an example-since they apparently still do service after the change). To some it is and to some it isn't. If you want a truly accurate poll, one needs to define the key word or all you are going to get is one up-vote having an entirely different weight and definition for the other. @barajabali is what your looking for instead of a poll like this.

Ya know? I'm thinking if people have a gripe, and there's a poll that directly relates, we as vendors should expect to fall into our spots. Obviously I have a couple of haters too, but at least they are still thinking about me. (Probably more a form of regret than anything else being they can't buy anything from me) My choice.
