After so many pms I have decided it's easier just to have one major post I will be making batteries and selling custom boards for the average builder. 
Currently I will offer 10s configurations if you want a different voltage let me know and I will see if I can accommodate. 
My boards will be designed completely off your budget and I can do single and dual drive hub or belt drive trains 

A few boards I've built are posted below along with batteries<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/8/28ad6906483bddbee8d5e4cbd23ea812303a917c.JPG" width="259" height="194"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/4/94bc9172014edf4f31a683242a7d0f6930e16584.jpg" width="402" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/d/3ddfc68647c4321e167c9b5b6565e2cda18a9332.jpg" width="541" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/0/d0614e07faf233d5b301d1e103a651f6b0301fca.jpg" width="306" height="373"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/8/18f47415d857de5f99dff7d66fd7caeb3ff1e1a6.PNG" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/b/8b9a352e1a1b54b5fadb3f2f902a7cc557be78ff.JPG" width="375" height="500">
One of these is just sporting my battery but was rebuilt by the customer

These prices will vary based on cells used I currently offer 25r, lghg2, lghe4, lghe2, 30q, and Basen 26650
10s 3p $350 
10s 4p $400
10s 5p $450

The battery powered above was done in electrical tape not heatshrink just because of customer preference it does however provide good insulation, I should also mention I use 10awg single core copper wire on top of the nickel strip for better current flow which is included in the price. I use silicone to mount them to enclosure and use rubber sealant on enclosures for weather proofing, these enclosures were not done by me but I will offer my own potentially in the future

maybe show some examples of boards you've built, batteries you've built, and prices?

And where are you located?

best of luck!
