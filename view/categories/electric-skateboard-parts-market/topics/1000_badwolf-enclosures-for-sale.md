Would anyone be interested in a Badwolf Enclosure for their GT2B? I have a couple extra and I would let them go for $27 shipped to your door. I can print more too. I have orange and hot pink PLA and I also have black and glow in the dark ABS. Just kind of gauging interest. Thanks guys.

@stuxtruth does the print include the switch as well or just the top and bottom shell? also any chance you could print it in white?

Hate to burst your bubble, but I am big into 3D Modeling and respect the work BadWolf put into making this. Saying that when I see someone selling them, I very politely tell them that it is illegal. Unless BadWolf gave you permission to sell, he can sue you for income 10 fold and lawyer fees. The creative commons license is very strict on Thingiverse. If this is a chance you would like to take go right ahead. Anyway, I don't want to sound mean in anyway, you can try modeling one yourself and sell them all you want..

I would also like to add that $27 is REALLY expensive.. It probably costs you less that $2 in filament to print these

I Got to be honest. The badwolf controller is old news. Check out what I just got and set up. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fd2d07f9d407fcb2b0d23c695a1428b84081bc63.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/61992bb60f702485b9e27cc720da6c84be2517a2.jpg" width="375" height="500">

It's a lot less cutting of the board and the walls are very think I could throw it at the floor and it'd be fine and no to mention that I still have access to all the knobs and reverse  settings. It's fits in my hand very nicely, doesn't look like a gun,and looks a lot cooler than badwolf

Here is another GT2B version i designed a while back I shared it on ES a little while ago. https://sites.google.com/site/enclosureredesign/home/3d-printing
STL files are on the site. CAD Models available upon request.
I also machined it out of aluminum :slight_smile:

This looks great, thanks for sharing! You wouldn't happen to have just a DXF of the 2d outline with screw/switch holes I could use to modify in sketchup? I like this overall shape- looks compact and sturdy!

I think that's for the GT2E- appears to be a different circuit board inside.
