Paris Hanger and stuff

Killer. I rode it today, a 220lb man (not recommend weight) was going 20mph on a 10s. It's so quiet and thats why I love these Hub motors.

Yes of course Lol. Just make sure its not more than a 15 Degree slope because it will cause the Urethane to slip due to heat. But a hill every now and then should be okay.
