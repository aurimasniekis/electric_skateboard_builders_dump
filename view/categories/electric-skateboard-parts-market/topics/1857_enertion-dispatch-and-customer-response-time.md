  I placed an order a few weeks ago and I was wondering what is the waiting time everyone else is gettinh because I have not received any email update all response to my emails for a month. Is that normal? I know he is running his own business but I have spent a lot of money on this site, what is everyone's response times to emails or shipment ??

What are you waiting for?

if you ordered a VESC, they need to be made, so you will be waiting
if you ordered a 2.4GHZ remote, they are out of stock, so you will be waiting
if you ordered a Raptor, they are waiting on Carbon Fiber Deck to arrive, 


if you order something that is not listed there is maybe some other issues that need to be addressed.


How did you try contacting us?
