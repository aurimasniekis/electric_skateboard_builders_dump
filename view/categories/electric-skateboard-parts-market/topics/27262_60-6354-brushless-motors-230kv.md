Hey guys,

I know this is not the best place to post this topic but I figured people view this forum area more often..

I have been in contact with a manufacturer and am able to get my hands on 6354 230kv brushless motors for 60 bucks! There would also shipping to you (could not be anymore more than a few bucks). I can attach photos when they provide them. I'd be more than happy do to the order and shipping etc. They would arrive to my place in Holland, Michigan and I could ship immediately to you.

MINIMIUM ORDER OF 5 PEOPLE. We need more motor group buys...

This exact motor but in black...

I have attached a poll to get a good idea of how many people are interested. 

[poll type=regular]
* Yes I am interested
* No I shall pass on this deal
[/poll]

Let me know!

Would these motors be sensored or unsensored?

From what I have been told, sensored!

However there may be unsensored options, I can ask. But it looks like sensored.

@marcus we have a rule on the forum that any member starting a group buy must be level 3. Please hang out here a little longer and then give this try then.
