6 layer (2 fiberglass) deck from GBomb with two super fork brackets. Each bracket is good for 13 degrees of wedge/angle. I had planned to run this deck with some adjustable baseplates or TKP trucks with the Trampa fiberglass battery tray. 

The deck is 26” long and about 9.5” wide. It’s a nice platform and the longest wheelbase you can get on a deck this size. 

Asking $180 shipped

I might be interested. Im pretty darn big/heavy though. You think this board and those brackets hold a 270lbs rider??? Website says its total weight is 4.4lbs correct?

I have it all boxed up so I’ll take the site’s word on the weight. 

I don’t see why it wouldn’t hold 270. If you pair the deck with trampa’s fiberglass enclosure rather than a plastic enclosure, you’d gain some rigidity too.
