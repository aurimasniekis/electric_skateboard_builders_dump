So it seems that a lot of people had issues with their laser cutters, so wether they returned it or it's now a peper weight. I seems the only happy ones are those who paid 8k for one.

Is there anything affordable in the market?

Have you checked the [Glowforge](https://glowforge.com/order). I Think most of cheap ones like the K40 wonâ€™t have the work area to fit a whole grip tape sheet and they need lots of upgrades.  
There was a link for a store on Etsy that does custom orders and it was pretty cheap.

I just came back from reading the glowforge forum for an hour, it seems I found another world, there is so much to learn about laser cutting, it involves designing, practicing And a lot of money investment. 

The basic cost about $2500 and it can cut and engrave
