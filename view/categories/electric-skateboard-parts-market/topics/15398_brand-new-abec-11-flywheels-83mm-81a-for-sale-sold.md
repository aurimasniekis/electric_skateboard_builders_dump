Not my wheels. But thought someone might want to buy them since you basically can't find them anywhere else.

Ok, what is the big whoop with these wheels? Everyone wants them, Do they ride really smooth? Just trying to understand the HYPE.

I personlly don't own these wheels, but I heard they are very durable, super smooth, ride great, and you don't feel anything on the road.
