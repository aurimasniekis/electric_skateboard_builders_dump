I have a dual Kaly motor mount kit for Trampa Vertigo trucks that I want to sell.  I bought them in February thinking I would use the motor plates, but I ended up going another way. This kit has never been used.  $100 plus shipping, they will ship the same day payment is made (as long as it's before 5PM CST).

Shipping will be $7.20 in the US.  I really just want to sell these in the US to avoid the customs paperwork and cost of shipping.  I would be willing to trade for x2 used 6354/6364 sensored motors if they are in decent shape.

thanks for looking :slight_smile:
