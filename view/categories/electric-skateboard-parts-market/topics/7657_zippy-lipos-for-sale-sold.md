That is a good information! I am not interessted but it would be nice if you could provide some information about how often you have charged them. Other ppl can estimate their lifespan which seems pretty good (5 milliohms).

I would be happy to give that info if I had it. Unfortunately I have not kept a log of charges and discharges.
I did use them in 2p sets at 12s and had 3 set to cycle through with 1 eboard.
