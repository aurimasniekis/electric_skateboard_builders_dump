I don't want to mess with buying cells from alibaba. LiIon tests all of their cells, and are an established company. There would be no shipping cost to me and I would be willing to distribute them. An shipping times on Alibaba..

Here are some prices / bulk

**LG HE2**

**Samsung 25R**

**Panasonic NCR18650B**

Here is a link to their website 
http://liionwholesale.com/

It is a long drive so I would need a few hundred cells to buy to make it worth my time

has anyone made a "business" account and bought cells from here: https://batterybro.com/collections/all

They seem super legit, and we could organize a big enough group that it would have a legit business vibe as opposed to just some personal account buying 70 cells or something.

i'm with @JLabs  on this one. i've been eyeballing liionwholesale.com for a while now.

i'm interested.

I'm also kind of interested in those efest IMR 26650 5200mah 15A/45A cells, and 500 of those would bring the price down to 7.90 per cell, but i don't know if that would work in this group buy scenario because using fewer, larger cells is counter productive to trying to get a bulk discount by buying 500 smaller cells as a group.

## HUGE NEWS!! ##

I contacted Liion Whole sale.. and they said that they would be willing to give us the whole sale price and individually send out the packages!! So money would not have to be transferred through me or another person on the forum.. Shipping to Pennsylvania is $11 for up to 30cells and California is $16 for up to 30 cells. Price fluctuates in between.. Each person has to buy minimum of 20 cells tho (quote from liion)   Shipping is UPS or USPS ground!

Does this sound good to everyone?? @delta_19 not sure what shipping is to Canada..

They said for me to email them with the cell count for each person, their address, and their email, and they would send a quote to everyone individually with the whole sale price!!!

I may be interested in this. I am fine with soldering and building the pack, but would it be cheaper to do this, or get a lipo back from hobbyking?  how many cells would it take to make a decent enough sized pack that would have a good range?

im thinking between 30 and 40 cells would be a good.  Space cell uses 30 (orignial) so since im making it myself i'd want to upgrade and use a few more. at 10s. 36volts. 

Whats cheaper?  lipo's  
Whats cheaper long term?  18650s lol

youll find yourself replacing lipos much more often than Liion's

So we're talking the 2500mAh variety? To beat the space cell with that one you need a 10S4P, or 40 cells. 

Yeah i think that's what i'll do. 

I just can't decide if i want to buy 44 cells or 84 cells. I want to buy 4 extra in case some are duds, but i also want to get cells while they're cheap and maybe get enough for two packs. I can't decide.

and i would be in depending on how much 100 cells would put me back. 80 for me and 20 to sell at 7.50 a cell, fuck i love vapers

For everyone considering this; this video helps to show all of the tools needed\recommended to make a pack. He covers a lot of the basics, totally worth the watch if you're new or need a refresher. I'm still exploring the soldering option vs using a spot welder. I'd like to avoid buying another $200 tool that I won't use too many times. Any thoughts on whether that's a feasible option?

Im using a soldering iron, its a lot more versatile than a spot welder.  It has more purpose dollar for dollar.  Unless making battery packs is a constant thing for you then id invest in a spot welder.   I use a soldering iron and it works fine, aslong as the material youre using to connect the battery together can 'wet' to solder then itll work.

agreed: I think I'm going to go with 44 cells like LHB. 

I'm still debating on whether to go 12s3p (for @Hummie's hub motors) or 6s5p for my personal single motor setup.... I made a 6s3p for my new LHB deck, but I really feel it needs more. Plus, I don't have too much confidence in that little pack delivering the amps, range, or reliability with it being small and the first 18650 pack I've soldered. 

I have a space cell now, so I could always use that with the hub motors. 

44 cells with allow me to either have 8 extra or 14 extra, which gives me a nice cushion so I don't have to worry about screwing up and not being able to finish my pack.  

@JLabs so 44 cells should end up being roughly $200 give or take; just let me know when you are going to start emailing them, or when you want me to send you the necessary information (and that STL file for the remote when I get home :wink:)

thanks for helping to organize this!

Also need to figure out what BMS and charger i'm planning to use from now on. I really like the ones from Shenzen in the space cell, but i've been talking to evmadrid on instagram and he says the ones from batterysupports are good too, and those can just be ordered online. They have a larger footprint though. 

More research!

Your boobs are incredibly distracting. I keep looking at them and then i remember you're a dude and then i feel dirty inside. The kind of dirty that a shower won't clean. 

Also i'm totally going sledless, probably just glue the cells together like a bike pack and then solder on the nickel strips.

God dammit.. now i miss your boob pic. Clearly i have some self discovery to do. 

I want the smallest pack possible, which means not using sleds. A BMS means i don't have to remove them anyway, i just have to plug it into a wall and forget about it until its done charging.

@longhairedboy @barajabali @cmatson I priced out a pack build, assuming $4.33 per cell for Samsung 25R, in 10s4p. Some of these are guesses (port, wire, and nickel). I rarely get anything to my door for less than $10. Any I missing anything? What about the material to give the pack some structural integrity, or sleds?

10s4p	
cells (40)	        $173.00
bms 	        $37.00
charger	        $51.00
meter	        $35.00
port                 $10.00
nickel	        $15.00
heatshrink	$15.00
tape	                $10.00
wire	               $10.00
	
	               $356.00

EDIT - I forgot to add a power switch! What is everyone going to use for on\off @longhairedboy @cmatson @barajabali ?

-shipping and tax not included. That's a lot of battery!

you can easily knock out. the bms (37) and charger (57) + shipping if you just pay 5 dollars for some balance leads and charger it with a 10s capable lipo charger!

My pack shouldnt cost more than just the cells.  I have a 37v bms and a charger both from an old 'hoverboard'  You can just buy a 'hoverboard' charger and bms if you want, has an output of like 42 volts or something. 

my pack is just gonna be a little under 200 bucks. 

To ad structure to the pack you just hot glue in between the cells long-ways.

@barajabali $38 at batterysupports.com for a 60A 10S BMS. 

@treenutter luckily i have all the tape and wire i need, but still need to pick up some nickel strips and heatshrink. The charging port for that charger actually comes with the charger, you just wire it into the box however you like. 

but yeah i'm still coming out at around $300 bucks, but that's not bad at all for a 10Ah 10S pack with charger.

You need to PM the following info

 1. Name
 2. Address
 3. Email
 4. Cell Count / How many you are purchasing

I have all ready received info from 
@barajabali
@longhairedboy  

If you could PM all of the info in one message that would be great.

*If anyone still wants to get in the group buy PM me your info, it will be closed after today (3/30/16)*

If all goes well (I'm sure it will) I will try to organize another group buy in 2 - 4 months.. If anyone would like to get one started before them PM me and I will create a separate thread titled '18650 Group Buy 2' 

If you are a first time pack builder make sure to stay current with my 18650 build post link below

I have looked at so many videos you guys....

But still will wait to see your builds...not that I'm not convinced that you are gonna have some killer packs....

Just wondering what battery configuration will you be using to maximize cell count in the most compact package, with the lowest profile... Having not actually held a 18650 in my hand (or have seen any newer electric skateboards)...will the power pack footprint be much less? (Is it that much more of a difference?)...I'm just talking abt real estate...Also, will this cause you to redo your enclosures? Or just give you more room to pack more cells in the old enclosures? 

Being the battery noob here

if you have a space cell, tear it open and have a look. It will tell you literally everything you need to know to build your own. While i don't completely understand why balance charging works in the way that it does, these packs are surprisingly simple to construct based on what i've seen. 

18650s are, as the name implies, 18mm in diameter by 65mm in length. By comparison, a AA is ~14mm in diameter and ~50  mm in length. So they're noticably larger than a AA and even slightly larger than an A but not anywhere near the size of a C.

Usually the rate is zero... But figuring the circumstances the next reorder may be a while so it's good to get maybe one for every ten you order. The only thing that might happen is shorting a cell out

Does anyone have a sense of the shipping\processing speed from this group? Will it be weeks, months? before cells arrive at my door.

I suffer from this greatly. I want to buy nickel strips and shrink tubing now, but i think i want the cells in my hand before i get any of that, which means i may as well get the charger and BMS and balance pigtails and 20awg silicone wire at that point. 

Shrink tubing is the big thing for me. There's tons of larger tubing on ebay that will do the job, but i can't make sense of the sizes they post, so i want to have my cells in hand so i can measure things. 

This time around i'm soldering my strips on, but i think i'm going to try getting a semi decent spot welder soon. 

I guess i could start buying things i need now.

space is the same as spot welding length and width wise, its about 4mm taller because of the sleds. so far i have not been able to do a real test because the first time i rode it my esc broke off my board and a solder joint broke and shorted a transistor out.

8mm wide nickel strips for 18650 and 26650 packs:

10S balance plug with pig tails and 22 awg silicone leads leads that aren't really long enough but that's ok because you can get more 22 awg two links up:

plus you can get a good BMS and charger from batterysupports.com

charger:

@longhairedboy I had the same issue so wrote to battery supports to see if they are aware of the problem. I'll let you know when\if I hear back.... it's not a great sign that they aren't able to accept payment. Payment is sorta important for a business I think. I hope they didn't go under.

if we're going to do another group buy, it should be for BMSs. I would buy 3 or 4 of them. 

I have 5 Shenzen 10S 30Amp BMSs sitting on my bench and i can't touch them because they're allocated for space cell repairs. At least i think they're 30 amp. They may be the 60 amp variation.  Meanwhile i can't order any of my own from anyone, which is more infuriating than getting my hair caught in the dremel that one time. 

But i'm sure as soon as i found a supplier and got a sample they're go out of stock or out of business anyway, especially if i put it on instagram with any sort of good information. Maybe i should just take pics of my fucking food instead.

So this is the BMS that I used on my last project, it's from Bestech.  BTW this is how you fit 10 pounds of shit in a 5 pound bucket!  They have a minimum order of two and they were like $120 for both with shipping and what ever other charge they added.  BTW that one LHB linked earlier, keep in mind it doesn't have a connection for a switch, that needs to be factored in on the price.  I specifically requested a connection for a switch!  Otherwise you end up spending another $40-60 on an external high power switch.

I think i can do better than that. Our buddies at liion wholesale may be willing to do a group buy on the Shenzen BMSs we've seen in such elegant packs as the Space Cell. I offered some preliminary specs to see if they could do it, such as 60A/80A-ish , softswitch, solder points for fuel guage, heat sensors, and asked if they could have the fuel guage on but not the mains output while powered off and charging.

i'll post thier reply when i get it and then maybe start a thread and get orders from you guys if they can do it.

@longhairedboy Just to add to the pile of options, I got a quote today from Bestech for this BMS. Price is $49.50. Minimum order is two. I'd love it if someone here who has experience selecting BMS's could take a look at the specs and help me to understand whether this is a good choice for 10s3p. It seems to be aligned with what we've been looking for. It's even more robust with 80a continuous discharge and 20a charging. Also is wired for a power switch.

Plus heatsinks! If you build PCs, you know that heatsinks mean POWERSPEEDLIGHTNING AHHHHH!!!!

That is exactly the one I used on my last project, except mine was rated to 40amps.  Seems they use the same PCB for multiple amp ratings and just add or delete FETs as needed.  Keep in mind shipping for two pieces was $28 plus a "paypal usage fee" of nearly $6.  It took around 3 weeks to receive them.

@longhairedboy @Ulfberht  Naw man just slum-it with the rest of us and solder it! There are lots of videos showing that soldering can be safe and effective with 18650s. I believe that @chaka even endorsed this... 

Of course, if you're going to start making a lot of packs maybe the time savings is worth it.

@delta_19 that's a good point... when I look at RAM I certainly check for heatsinks, although I feel like the marketing hype associated with the increased performance is overblown. Nonetheless, since I have few other ways to assess the quality of a BMS, I agree that heatsinks and wired-for-a-power-switch must be a good thing!

@BigAl Gah! 3 weeks!? Thanks for the heads-up!

@Ulfberht that is the same spot welder I was considering until I figured out that I can solder 18650s. My current plan is to solder.

i'm planning on making my own packs from now on as even without group buys i can build them substantially less money than buying them, and despite having a decent 75 watt solder station, i'd have to order some flat tips anyway, tips i would probably never use for anything else. 

if all goes well i'm probably going to build and sell packs on my site, starting in very low quantities of course. i was waiting on my boxes to get finished up before i started this but fucking christ that guy is taking his sweet time getting my shit done. I may just cancel the whole thing and start making my own reusable molds and just do my own damned boxes out of fiberglass.

that's basically the one i was going to get from JoyFay for $140 ish plus shipping. I'm probably going to go ahead and grab one on pay day.

FYI: I'd check out the ebay listing again, bro!! US stock, so you get it faster and customer service logistics make better sense.From JOYFAY.com, I got a $30 shipping quote on top of the $143 list price. $173 and much longer shipping time estimate. The ebay seller also has a "Make Offer"  button, so I bet we can get it cheaper. I already sent an offer in. We'll see what happens. Happy hunting!!

You should be able to use it. 

Some BMS tips for the uninitiated...Charging with a lower wattage charger will allow the pack to balance more as it reaches full charge. Charge too quickly and voltage peaks before balancing can take place. The bms will not actively balance the pack when not charging, balancing only occurs when a cell breaches 4.2v while charging.

Just checked on my other pieces.. looks like my reel of nickel strip, balance leads, and fuel gauges will be here next week. 

I'm still flip flopping on if i should get a spot welder or a flat soldering tip for my iron. I like the idea of quickly putting together packs and i plan on making my own from now on, so maybe i should just do it.

Nice @barajabali! Is everyone using battery trays, or are you going to hot-glue them into the shape you want? It seems like the trays offer a tiny bit of airflow between the cells, which would help with heat dispersion. In theory that seems good, but I'm not sure if it matters in practice. @longhairedboy @cmatson @Sharkface @Ulfberht

I'm hot gluing them. I'll put them in an aluminum frame tho most likely. I don't need them for a while. Still figuring out where I'm gonna get esc 's from lol and my hub motors.

Keeping batteries cool is important but you'd really have to push them for that to be an issue

Oh good! I'm still deciding on whether to buy 10s2p or 10s3p. 

Also just a quick question for the BMS side of things. How does the BMS balance each sell when it only has like 10 or so leads? Are each of the balancing connections just connected to each pack of series and that's it, not each cell?
```

---
## \#239 Posted by: Sharkface Posted at: 2016-04-13T01:32:51.396Z Reads: 117

```
You are correct that they connect to each of the "P"s, or series set. In your case 10s2p... 10 leads..... so a lead plugged into each positive end of the set of series cells. Of course this depends on the BMS itself. The BMS you describe probably has the positive and negative leads coming through it, then the set of balance wires. A more simple BMS could easily just have a set of 11 balance wires and does nothing but trim high voltages from each set of series. 

Basically use the KISS methodology. Keep It Stupidly Simple. A BMS reads in the voltage after each new set of parallel cells to ensure that each set of parallel cells is operating at the same voltage. Any feature set additional to that is just for safetfy measures and enhances the M in BMS. So each BMS is going to try and do this in one way or another, its just a matter of figuring out how the BMS does it based off of the diagram/featureset of the BMS.

Good luck on that one as well! lol

Thanks for the explanation! I was really stumped on that. 

I think I'll go with 10s3p so the max current draw will be 60A if I am not mistaken. That will match my motor's max current draw of 60A.
```

## \#241 Posted by: Sharkface Posted at: 2016-04-13T01:58:12.512Z Reads: 118

and more importantly than your motors max draw, but the max continuous draw of the VESC ;)

And yeah itll be 60A. (thats why the 10s4p SPACE cell can rock out on 80A)

The battery itself is a combo of solder and spot weld. I like that. Having the nickel strips spot welded holds everything together, then having the copper wires soldered will ensure that you dont have too high an amp draw on those nickel strips. Def think this is a great idea yall

Unless im mistaken those holders go over the ends which would be hard if you spot weld, but if you are soldering then I think its a great idea. Put the caps on, super glue them onto the battery, solder the wires into place, then hot glue the wires to the holders. Doing something like that just right would allow you to have a pack that will flex with the board.

Pretty sweet thread, huh? I like the idea of using solid strips of nickel instead of a million little strips. 
The only thing I would change would be using bus wire instead of solder wick, I wasn't sure if I wanted to use the holders, but I thought I'd at least order them from China now because they will take a couple of weeks to get here anyway. I may not use them at all. 10s5p takes up a bit of space. I thought I might be able to reinforce the pack by attaching the pack with holders then attaching that to a piece of reinforcement to keep flex to a minimum. Holders also seem like it would make setting up the pack for soldering easier. They lock together like legos. IDK Still doing research.

I'm going to hot glue to shape, then run the whole thing under the spot welder to tack on the nickel strips. That's my plan anyway. I've been watching people build bike packs on instagram, that's how they do it. They have hand held welding electrodes, but because i'm only going two cells high with my stacking and not making 10S6P packs shaped like triangles, i can still just hold the whole pack under the fixed position electrodes on the front of my spot welder. 

I'm going with two rows of 20 cells, 10 cells long, 2 cells wide and 2 cells tall. So i'm going to need some sort of structural reinforcement, possibly an ABS plate between the two rows to keep everything tight but separate when the whole things goes into a shrink tube. 

One day i'd really like to get a hand held electrode though. Then i could leave the welder on the shelf and the pedal on the floor and have both hands free for spot welding since the pack would be sitting on the bench instead of in my hand. I could probably make one. Maybe i will. Maybe I'll integrate the foot switch's switch into the handle too. That's all blue sky right now though. I haven't even tested the thing yet.

I have tried both, I like to use the stationary electrodes. Much faster and easier to use, also, the handheld electrodes loose a little penetration. Probably due to the extra cable length.

My build is on hold until I get my other parts order in. I got a nice fat order from TB on the way! Should ship this week! Fingers crossed. Once I get the parts and fit everything to the deck that I'm building I'll know exactly what shape and configuration to go with. The pack is going to actually be imbedded in the board, so space is TIGHT for a 10s5p pack!!  I measured everything, but I know that until everthing is physically layed out, I won't be able to really see what direction to go in. Finally got some REAL nickel strips instead of the cheap Chinese plated steel strips. I bought 3 different ones and only 1 was legit. The others rusted out like crazy in the salt water I used to test them. It looked like they were bleeding or something. LOL
