Here is a image of our 63 mm Motors they look bad ass in black. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/03e2f3f8e3338d5fa4934097fa3ed659b9b041f8.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/07739c8b906160c9cd703086c61cbb30eed22b87.jpg" width="375" height="500">

The red motor is our 50 mm motor so you can see the difference

Thanks yea I love these black 63 mm they look cool and are sensored as well as been more sealed to dust and dirt than other motors which is handy. ( less vent holes)

That burnout video made me think of how cool it would be to have a drift race with electric longboards. Has anyone tried using slide wheels on your builds?

I think black motors increase the speed by somewhere around 10% per motor. At least that's what I've heard.:wink:

17% if the black is a metric shade. SAE blacks are less efficient.

Thanks @skatehead Those are definitely one of my considered setups for my upcoming build. I am at the gym more regularly now dropping my excess cargo but my current 2m by 130kg frame I know is at a disadvantage for most set ups. Oh I can ride but keeping up with the Lewis Hamilton's of the neighborhood (my kids) requires a larger set of turbos.

Any R&D work in the direction of hub motors for those wheels. I figure with their larger diameter it would have tremendous torque available.

Hi Monster,
 no problem. 
Have you considered a 4 x 63 mm power plant ? that would be seriously powerful. 
and 4WD ! That would give you some serious power to keep up :) with ya kids and kick ass on mountains/hills.
If you are interested I will get you a price for 2 x trucks with motors mounted and also the electric system to run it then you would just have to bolt them on to a deck and add a battery of your choice. 

PS here is the twin 63 mm board in action https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f8y3DnyDhk
