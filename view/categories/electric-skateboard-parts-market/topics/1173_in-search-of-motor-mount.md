Hi guys, I'm currently looking for anyone that'd be interested in letting an adjustable motor mount go, *or* trucks with a mount already welded on!

I was planning on welding my own, but discovered I don't have access to an aluminum welder haha.

I'm currently on backorder, but you have several choices on mounts available to you. All you have to do is choose one and buy it.

I have an old beat up pair of DIY's welded motor mounts. Be advised they're pretty bashed but still work. Pm me I'll send you pics and I'll let them go cheap.
