... from a company in the good ol USA who seemed to dig that i build irresponsibly steezy boards. 

These will be 16T for 12mm belts, keyed for the 3mm keys we use with our motors and have grubs in the belt surface because they will have no overhang and feature flanges on both sides. It will fit the standard 8mm shaft on most motors. 

I'm doing this because nobody seems to want to stock this particular style of motor pulley anymore and i fucking need them. 

So they will also be available for sale in my shop because i try to make everything i use available if at all feasible

If this works out i may see if they can also produce an aluminum variant of my 36T kegel based wheel pulley because 16/36 on 100mm boas seems to be a damned fine sweet spot for just about everyone who has set foot on my current build. 

I'll keep you guys posted.


**UPDATE**

just listed them on the shop:

preferably over the key, i prefer not to have rattles, although usually they don't anyway.

m4 probably, that seems to be the standard.

I tried using superglue in addition to the normal stuff.  Sucks for taking stuff apart, but rattles be gone.

So far it's great.  One drop on the key when you put it together

they sent me drawings to approve in imperial units, so I asked them to please go back send them to me in metric.  

somebody has to stand up for progress in this country. Baby steps. lol

Just an update: The set screws are at a 90 deg angle to each other, with one over the keyway and one on the shaft. Also they are M3, not M4 as I previously stated. 

still waiting on a drawing from them in metric units before i post it, but i have verified for myself that the measurements are right. The belt surface area is 13.0048 exactly. 

the plan is to approve it and give them money today if they get it back to me in time. I'm not yet sure what the turnaround time will be.

I was able to get this moving, but we're looking at about 4 more weeks of lead time apparently. So hopefully in about a month we'll have some steel motor pulleys happening.

No you don't. Yours have a collar. 

I don't want that which was the whole point of this. Literally everyone has that pulley and noone has the one i want. 

I'm checking in with them to see if we're still on track. They should start stamping them out in a week or so unless they got behind.

they'll fit anything with an 8mm shaft. I use maytech motors also.

looks like the standard 3mm keyway maytech's always used, so yeah, it should be fine. 

They'll be able to ship some time next week, apparently. Which is good, i'll have the money some time next week. LOL

This is awesome!

My favourite configuration of motor pulley, 16t, steel, keyway, no shoulder...
if only it was 15mm wide. :tired_face:

Hope it works out good for you with the manufacturer be good to deal with and they sell out quick so you can some more orders with them. 

Made in the US, I wonder if there will be a noticeable increase in quality of chinese steel pulleys?

They only have a collar on one side...Flip it over. they come with 4 set screws so flipping it isn't an issue. And, seems to me I can still touch the mount with the pulley on my mounts, so why is the collar  even an issue?

your MOM has a collar!

Reversing the pulley and trying to shove the collar into the shaft-space on the motor mount doesn't work on my mounts, grinding the collar off takes too long, i don't like the way the collar hangs over the end of the motor shaft, and i don't want longer motor shafts... I'm just picky. 

one day i'll sit down and design all new mounts and everything but not today. Today i just want an endless supply of motor pulleys that don't have special needs and will be happy to put 12mm belts on anything with an 8mm shaft.

Just got in touch with the people making these things. They said they'll ship next week, they're still plating and assembling them apparently. 

it will be nice to never have to go hunting for motor pulleys again.

This experience wasn't unpleasant. It took them two and a half months but that's fine if the part is legit. 

We were thinking about ordering some with 17 teeth next, but a 10mm bore wouldn't be out of the question if there's enough interest in a particular tooth count.

I know not many rock motors with 10mm shafts.
Maybe if these motors become popular but atm there probably 10 members with them. 

17t for 8mm would be cool too. 
I like having a verity in my tool box.

The pulleys have shipped! In order to make sure i got the best rate in shipping i sent them my own label. 

Tracking has the package arriving by 8pm tonight, but i'm guessing i'll see them tomorrow. 

If everything checks out, they'll be in the shop ready to ship by next week. 

I doubt if i'll be including hex wrenches with them but i believe i do have plenty of grubs to pack them with, so i should be able to include a spare. I may need to order some more keys though. They should probably include keys. 

We'll see what's up when they get here. Before anything, i need to know they work as intended, which means adding a set to my board and promptly going faster than is safe.  Possibly into some bushes.

I got some 16 and 18 10mm ones (UK, right? 2 weeks lead time for mine, but im only in europe), seem very solid. 2 piece design press fitted.
Very heavy, as it is steel. Being the noob I am, I took m2 lock screws.. there was room enough so my buddy drilled 2 m4 in it.
Not tested yet, picked them up saturday after redrilling.

They're here. I'm putting them in baggies now. The grubs were included, though i think next time around i'm going to ask for larger grubs. Also i feel like the hex keys for them are an american size and not metric, which will also be rectified in a future batch, but these will definitely do for now. 

Anyone know what stupid american fractional unit size falls between 1.5 and 2mm hey key sizes? 1.5mm feels a tad loose but 2mm is too big.
