I live in NZ, so prices are in USD and include shipping to the states with NZ post, which surprisingly, is a genuinely competent postal service. Some phenomenal deals listed here

Dunno if there'll be any interest in these, but I have a few completes that I haven't been able to sell.

Board One: Loaded Cantellated Tesseract Complete

https://preview.trademe.co.nz/marketplace/sports/skateboarding-rollerblading/skateboards/longboards/listing/1680158324

Board Two: Root Longboards complete with Surfrodz Trucks

https://preview.trademe.co.nz/marketplace/sports/skateboarding-rollerblading/skateboards/longboards/listing/1680150633

PM me if interested, I'll go lower because TM has ridiculous action fees! I'll remove it from the auction site and get it shipped to your door ASAP. Should probably mention the prices above are NZD :)
