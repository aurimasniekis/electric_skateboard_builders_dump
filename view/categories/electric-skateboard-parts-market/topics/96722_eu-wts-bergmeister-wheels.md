I bought 2 sets for my AT build, but decided to build MTB instead, so now im selling 2 new and never driven sets of haggy wheels. With each sets comes 4 spacers and 2 extra inner tubes. (no bearings). Im shipping from Croatia and looking to get around 190$ to cover price of the wheels and import fees.
