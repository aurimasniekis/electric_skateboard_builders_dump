it has been tested up to 50km/h which was way to fast. I can be customized to 35km/h.

Yes that's why we have limited to 40km/h. 
Even yet the rider dosent have to ride full throttle and ride at a comfortable speed for them. 
The speed is controlled by you.

Incorrect.  Other than the same length deck its completely different.  Higher top speed and longer run time.

It doesn't matter what the specks are its a rip off of the concept of the Bolt and you've just taken the idea!

Sorry Chris but you are wrong.
What your basically saying is that any other company that makes a small, light electric skateboard is a rip off of Bolt. Which is stupid as you can't even purchase a Bolt. 

Bolt integrates its electronics into the deck, this board has an entirely different setup. 

The top speed of Bolt is 21km/h, if you want we can produce an OHMBOY that will hit 50km/h.

Bolt has a 10km range, we have a 20-30km range. (its hard to put a decent battery in bolts deck)

Other then the wood deck (how many other skateboards have wood decks)

and the orange wheels (maybe bolt is ripping off Orangatang orange wheels! :open_mouth: ) 

They are two completely different boards.

But I presume you walk around the world thinking every car is a rip off of Toyota.

I agree with @ohmboy

all eboards are going to be eboards.. bolt didn't patent the idea of "a small portable electric skateboard" so therefore anyone can make something similar. 

Would you say an enertion raptor is a rip off boosted boards because it is the same size, and has  dual motors?

or a rip off of Marbel because it has a carbon fiber deck with encased electronics?

The problem is that all eboards are going to have similarities.. Just because one was made to do the same job (but better) doesn't mean it's a rip off from another. 

Now, when someone copies something EXACTLY (like what happened when a guy made 100+ identical copies of torqueboard's mount..) then I understand it is a rip off.
