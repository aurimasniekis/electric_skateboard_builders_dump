Looking to see if anyone would be interested in these motors. They have sensors set up in opposing directions to be used for a dual set up. I like running 6 or 8s and these would be too slow for me. These have only been bench tested. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d98274edf24860d25c56d9ac14ffec7782dba4cc.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

They can't be reversed?

They can, but Reverse doesn't seem to work as well. Not sure why. I've never wanted reverse anyway.
