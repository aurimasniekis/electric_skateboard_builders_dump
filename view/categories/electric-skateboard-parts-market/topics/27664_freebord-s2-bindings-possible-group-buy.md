I've been talking to Steve Bianco from Freebord about a bulk order/group buy for S2 Bindings.

https://store.freebord.com/s2-bindings/

We can get 10% off for 10 sets or 15% off for 20 sets.  Before I go any further I want to see how much interest there is.

He may ship directly or if it's cheaper ship to me and I'll re-ship.  If there's enough interest I'll find out the particulars.

Never ridden with bindings. Seem like a good idea for heavy braking in traffic.

Nope, not enough interest.  I bought 2 sets, for and my kid.  It would take 20 sets to make it worth doing.

What type of board are you using these on and what tricks do you do with it? Hopping curbs? slides?

I'm hoping to use a jet spud 29, if I can find one.  I'll probably use my jet spud 33 for awhile. 

Just hoping curbs mostly.
