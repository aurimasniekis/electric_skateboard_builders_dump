Hello,
I see that there is a lot of interest in cheap Li-ion battery packs. 
I have a spotwelder so why should I not get into the market ;) 
I live in Belgium so i can ship to the whole EU.

**Pack specs:**
You can choose your own battery configuration.
For the pack i use 12x0.15 40A 99.96% Pure Nickel. I use always two layers of strips so the max current is 80amps.
The output wires are 10 awg silicone wire (max current 120A).

**Price List:**
**Price per cell included spotwelding**
LG IMR18650-HE2 2500mAh - 20A **€3.99**
Samsung INR18650-30Q 3000mAh - 15A **€4.99**
Samsung INR18650-25R 2500mAh - 20A **€4.39**
Sony Konion US18650VTC6 3120mAh -30A **€5.99**
_If you want you can ask me for other cells_ 

**Options:**
LCD Battery Indicator/Voltmeter **€10**
Switch for BMS  **€2**
Balance wires for BMS  **€5**
PVC wrapping  **€5**
Output wires     **€2**
XT-90                **€2**
BMS-50A          **€60**
BMS from besttech (for price i must contact them)



**_All prices are an indicator, there may be slight changes (cheaper or more expensive) based on the configuration and type of cells_**

## Two own battery packs in building. When i am ready i go post photos.
