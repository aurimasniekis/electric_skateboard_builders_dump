Im looking for broken motors and escs that people are no longer using. The purpose of this is to experiment with different motors and escs to find an ideal setup and prototype a board. Id pay shipping too if thats easier for you but sadly could offer you no more than a thanks for your contribution. However if this project does succeed I would happily add you to my list of donors.
