Bought in Paris a few months ago for 170 euros but hardly used at all. Unfortunately, I don't feel comfortable riding short cruiser boards. 

Practically brand new with original grip tape. Less than 5 km on the wheels but has some surface level dinks from transport. All pictured.

Its this exact board

Alright then. Will take one of your enclosures :) 

Happy to add cash on top? Let’s say £30 plus one of your enclosures ? 

I pay for shipping the dinghy to you and you pay shipping the enclosure to me to Barcelona Spain? 

Let me know if that works for you
