## TOTALLY BITCHIN' 190KVS

I have 10 in stock and i slashed them down to $110. 

yeah yeah you can get cheaper motors but not packaged so neatly. Flexible 12awg silicone wires and a nice sensor wire sheath to match. Comes with sensor adaptor, snap rings, and pulley key. Also they say Totally Bitchin' right on the can. Obviously that means they are. 

Drop in replacement for Raptor 1 motors, works with the new OKP evolve mounts so you can seriously fuck up your freinds with bigger motors on your bamboo if you find the right sensor adaptors.

Depending on your mom's age, it may actually trigger a bit of nostalgia. It's an 80's reference. I grew up in the 80s and a lot of people enjoyed the 80s.

Lord Skatan will make @Longhairedboy very happy if some of his bitches find new costumers.
