You and everyone else wants to unity. Good luck finding someone willing to sell. Enertion has been super late on the orders.

Lol yeah I sold one awhile ago I just didnâ€™t need it. My two regular FOCBoxes worked just fine.  I think I sold it for just under what I paid for it. In retrospect I probably could have charged a premium!

I had damaged FOCBoxes but fixed them by desoldering my CAN chips & using split ppm
