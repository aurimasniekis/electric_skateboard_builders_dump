hey, I didn't found the section "New Items for Free" but you I think you got it. 

We are family, embrace diversity and I always thought that at some point money means many thing to many people. I got few parts available that can help a brother that's starting or who's short on money. These parts are free. Just pay for the shipping from Paris.

The mounts and sprocket are the ones I did two years ago, they have some visual defects but work fine. One bar is missing but it works without. It's not second hand, just new parts with little visual defects but fully functional.

![IMG_0950|375x500](upload://bciy5K1y5azt3m2WljMLFPyYInU.JPG)

The motor is just brand new out of the box.

![IMG_0987|666x500](upload://rHxJyqGnN5boOwU7oKvke4gV6cD.JPG)

I'm not asking for a rationale, but please be fair.

Cheers!

ps: this has nothing to do with Unikboards.

I was keeping this part as memories of Richard from ADS (Alien Drive Systems). This highly respected man literally changed the electric skateboarding builds with his mounts back in Endless Sphere days. A lot of credits of what people are doing today goes to him. It's a 32T 9mm kegel drive pulley and it's free for anyone who need to build his board.

hey fam, lets continue. This is the mount I have been riding on my single freestyle board with hooks. Apart from being dirty, it's in good shape and can be used like new for a guy that's on budget, cause it's free.

not sure exactly, but definitely a few years. that’s not to say it’s a bad mount tho, anything psycho makes is a solid product.

as for that second one, it looks more like an old APS mount with the clamping rings.

Thanks, but as it turned out, I went too light on material with those mounts. They worked and are still working on a few builds, but our new mounts are waaaaaay Stronger.

what I will say though, I have alot of those motor plates in a box. Brand new. Free replacements for anyone that breaks one. Just pay shipping.

just a quick recap - hopefully I didn't mess:

remark : @Jammeslu didn't release a mount, but the tacon motor

- @fedestanco : set of various mountainboards mounts for trampa spring trucks
- @Sebike :  UNiK smart caliber mount
- @Sebious : ADS 32T 9mm pulley 
- @acido : two sprockets for superstar hubs ISO4B

so what's left:
- one tacon motor in its box

who wants it ?!

Shoot, I just snagged that enclosure, but if you have the exact battery it's supposed to fit, you can have it. You've definitely gone out of your way for me, so I'm happy to help you out on some way, if I can. Of course if @Apolo doesn't mind sending it to you instead of me. @mmaner I can settle up with you directly for the shipping cost, so @Apolo doesn't have to deal with any paypal stuff. Let me know!

If you decide to let maner have it, I'll just refund you since shipping cost might differ depending on where he lives. Plus it's like 2 clicks on my paypal page anyway :wink:.

Got many requests for the mount, so I'd say they are gone.

@telnoi Hey man can i have the motor. My friend is building a board and he asked me to help him, i already gave him my old esc. This would help him a lot since he is quite broke, and also i talked him into making a board so i can ride with someone :smile:

I have SIX Orange Landwheel flywheel clones, BUT shipping from California to Croatia would cost a lot I think?


Up for grabs if anyone wants them. Pick 2 or 4 wheels, less than 5 miles on them (2 are basically new)
