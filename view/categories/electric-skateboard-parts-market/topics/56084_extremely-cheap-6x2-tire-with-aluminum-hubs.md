Has anyone tried these pnuemies out?

6X2 Inflation Tire Wheel Use 6" Tire Alloy Hub 160mm Pneumatic Tyre Scooter F0 Pneumatic Wheel Trolley Cart Air Wheel（62wheel） https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071VHR6BC/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_XLwaBbPA3DVDB

They are 28 bucks each shipped with prime. An entire set of 4 would be 112 bucks. If anyone can design a pulley for these things it would change the overall price of trying to run pnuemies. It would be less than running abecs!

And yes, they use standard 608 bearings

These do use 608's bu the hub is a lot wider. So, you would need to use extended axles.
