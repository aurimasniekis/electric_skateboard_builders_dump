So turns out my Nyko Kama sucked and can't figure out what's wrong with it. No sellers on ebay or amazon.com can ship to Sweden. Amazon.co.uk has one seller but it's extremely overpriced when shipping is factored in. 

So I'm looking for someone who have one too much preferably in Europe (quicker shipping, no import fees/tax).

Planning on buying one of these too but shipping from China is 3 weeks.. Might have a nunchuck on the way though.

Edit: Turns out it was with DHL so maybe it's an option after all.

@Iceni As mentioned I might have solved this but I might still be interested. Also have a friend who will need one eventually so if you have one you don't use it's interesting if you're willing to send it (live in Gothenburg).

Shouldn't be a problem, better someone get a use of it instead of collecting dust.
