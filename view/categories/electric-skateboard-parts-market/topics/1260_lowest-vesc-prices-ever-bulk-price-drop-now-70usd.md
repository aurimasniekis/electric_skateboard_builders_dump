   facility that can meet strict international standards.

Thank you for your answer ! 

I have just another question: I am currently living in France, and am also considering buying your VESC. Thus, I would like to know how your warehouse system will be set up ? And, when you explained that "some European borders might incur tax", is it because there isn't warehouse in some coutries or because we could face import duties in a random way ? 

Thanks again for your help and also for your offer which make VESC affordable for all !

Are there some taxes if something passes from one European country to another? if so you will have to pay that.

I have an option of two EU warehouses, UK or Netherlands.

Maybe someone @elkick who has experience can advise about the likely taxes for items passing borders in EU.

There is no tax when sending products within European Union (there are some special areas though, like Ã…land or Greenland. See the link). But you have to pay the VAT-rate of the country you are shipping from or where you are shipping to.

Yes, you're right, no tax for European Union trades. I have already buy from ADS in UK, or received parcel from hobbyking European warehouse and no tax, actually. 

Great thanks, it is a good news !

Sorry Skirk, your confusing customs duty with VAT tax.
Like Haimindo said, with the exceptions of a short list of little regions with exemptions, every business pays VAT when they sell to consumers. They also pay VAT when selling to businesses within their own country.
The price is the same for you as it is for UK citizens, because you are paying UK VAT.
Intra-EU kick into play when both parties have a VAT numbers (are businesses) and reside in different countries. Then it is possible to not pay VAT.

Onloop,
if your thinking of setting up a warehouse or reshipment service in EU, I'd go with Germany. 
The VAT rate is much lower than other counties. Germans pay less for shipping, since they are already the major shipping hub to most of Europe and are located in the central of Europe.
The lower VAT rate means that if the buyer is a consumer, they will pay less for the product.

Luxembourg has a lower VAT, but I've heard that they are very bureaucratic. 
Germans are bureaucratic as all hell, but in a logical way. 
Could almost say bureaucratic, but in a good way :)

You don't have to have a real warehouse to fulfil the tax requirements, it enough that you
form a company in Germany or apply for a VAT code with your existing Australian company.
You then package everything ready with the end recipients address and
stuff all these packages into a big box and ship it directly to the DHL terminal. 

Hope this helps.

Chaka (ollin boards) and torqueboards () are located in the US. 

Enertion is in Australia, but they (with this new batch of VESC's) now have US and EU warehouses.

Hi again, Thanks for your suggestions. Is there a technical difference between the VESC from Germany and the VESC from enertion?

I have a strange application for these controllers, plan on using them in a robot to control its brushless drive motors!
