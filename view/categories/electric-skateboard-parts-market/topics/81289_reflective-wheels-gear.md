That's actually really cool!

I'm more interested in the armored hoodie though. Do you have an estimated date when the IndieGoGo campaign will be released?

Weird reason to not buy from a company, but ok. Perhaps they should change it to "Safety is not an option ‚Äì it's a must" for people like you :stuck_out_tongue:

It should say "Safety is not optional", I think it's a mistranslation from Swedish

I'm with @b264 "safety is not optional" I think should convey the message better.

"Saftey is not an option" means safety will always be taken.

In other words, if you had to choose safety or something else. @LazyRolling doesnt even give you the option. They put saftey first and foremost. @ least that's what I get from it

yeah, not having another option is implied, but not everyone understand the "failure is not an option" kinda terminology.

"Safety is not an option" to me, means:
[quote]
You have options, please select one:
* unsafe
* reckless
* dangerous
* neglectful
* precarious
* perilous
* hazardous
* risky
[/quote]

So I do indeed think it's a mistranslation if safety products are your wares.

"Safety is not optional" may be a much better slogan.

It is a cultural thing.
"Safety is not an option"makes sense in my language.
Breathing is not an option.
Sex is not an option.
Do ya feel me?

YES! If you replace failure with safety in this image, then safety cannot be chosen.
