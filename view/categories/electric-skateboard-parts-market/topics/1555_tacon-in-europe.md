Hello guys,

Since i'm living in europe it really doesn't work out to order a TACON from hobbypartz. Shipping is almost as much as the motor it self. Does anyone have another source in europe? Or maybe with 3-4 people we could buy one together? I'm located in Belgium..

Why go through the hassle if hobbyking has similar motors that will work just as well ?
