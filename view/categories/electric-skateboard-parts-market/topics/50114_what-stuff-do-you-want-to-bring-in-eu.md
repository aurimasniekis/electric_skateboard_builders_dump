I'm tiered of paying skateboard stuff 500% more than in US example are wheels..

So I may have found a way for us EU people to have much lower prices for wheels(97mm flywheels 78a)

This is the price for a 15 people group buy
For 40euro + shipping to UK is 12e, I'm currently negotiating with different post services to see who is the cheapest..

Caliber Trucks 10 inch 44/50degrees
40Eur + 12Eur shipping to uk
(Did not compare the trucks price to whats available)

Also if you are interested in the wheels or anything else just post here so I have a rough number

Post here if there's a popular item that's cheap in US and expensive in EU
So I can see if I can do anything to bring it in EU.
I'm trying to bring the "hard to get" parts into peoples hands!
Maybe some pulleys?? 

Anyways I have a lot of time and shipping stuff is not a problem to me, actually is stress relieving to me.

So much :slight_smile:
Wheels : esk8 related and downhill related
Decks: crazy differences 

You have a supplier in mind or are all goods only available in a group buy manor? IF so maybe get a separate group buy going for gravity stuff ? :)

Waiting on their reply about shipping
Also the shipping from me might be a killer

I just checked 10kg package to uk is 25$ thats for 5 trucks or so

20kg ~ 10 trucks 48$
Someone trusted like you could just forward them to the buyers in UK
Waiting on reply from TB, we might squeeze some mounts belts pulleys etc also

We're doing like 5 different cutouts of the same mold. So we'll have a classic shape and an 'esk8' shape.

I don't know this for fact, but these wheels are unlike other Rock hard clones.
I got flywheel clones and they feel like 83a+ maybe this is different.
