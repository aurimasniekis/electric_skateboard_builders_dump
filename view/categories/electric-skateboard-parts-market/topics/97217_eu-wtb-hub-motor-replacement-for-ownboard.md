```
A motor started making some noise as if a bearing is almost done, and when trying to take apart I stripped a bolt. Looking for a fully working one, but might consider two. Located in UK. It is fine if the PU is bad as I have a replacement

It is the same model as here: http://www.diyeboard.com/replaceable-pu-dual-hub-motor-9055mm-500w2-power-truck-kit-p-671.html

Only looking for this specific model with replaceable PU. I think Wowgo also uses them, along with some other brands.
