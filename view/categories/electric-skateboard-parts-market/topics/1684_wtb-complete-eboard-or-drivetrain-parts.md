Hey guys :)
I'm looking to buy a used/second hand eboard setup, either a complete board or a complete drive train (esc, motors, trucks and maybe battery) or even just parts for the drivetrain.

Send me a PM or comment on the thread below, please include pictures :)

Where are you located? I'm thinking of selling my benchwheel e-board to fund my current build.

Australia, so US shipping might be a bit excessive for a whole board.

Not looking for something new, looking for something used that is in the lower end of the price range.
