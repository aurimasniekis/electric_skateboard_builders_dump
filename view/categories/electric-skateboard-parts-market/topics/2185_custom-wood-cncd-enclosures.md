Made with an Xcarve- not going to sell them quite yet as I want to get everything dialed in, but I am open to making some custom enclosures once i get everything down in the next week or so. 

Still have some work to do, but I'm happy with version 1 so far.

They look sick. But I am building a vacuum former for ABS soon. I'm sure you will get heaps of requests for the enclosures.

how do you set the battery indicator to lipos/higher voltage? Mines set to a 12V lead battery and I can't figure out how to change it

Maybe. Where did you buy it from? Some of them come with buttons and some don't.

We'll done @cmatson. That looks amazing.. Nice job on getting an XCarve! I've wanted one too. I'll most likely need to get one from you eventually.

Not only can you do enclosures but you can also make wooden molds for ABS enclosures!!! Sell molds.

[/quote]

probably, but I also think making a wood enclosure helps to stiffen the deck, which allows you to use longer 18650 packs without worrying about flex.

It's a shame making a mold and then popping out resin/carbon/fiberglass/abs stuff is so cheap and pretty awesome because it's all pretty nasty stuff compared to the smell of wood.

agreed. I really love the smell of wood, and i love working with it. But there's something about a completed fiberglass box that makes  me feel very good inside.

here is @longhairedboy's custom deck he made for me being cut into to fit a Space Cell and single VESC- 

I also have a pic of the CAD (autodesk fusion 360 is the program- royal pain in the ass to get all the milling parameters correct and tool paths clear of obstructions...hopefully it all works and is worth it in the end)  for a wood enclosure I hope to CNC this weekend once I pick up some nicer wood. And a bigger bit for this sort of large and flat milling....

I do have a shop vac to clean up the sawdust, and infact I ziptied it to the router so it sucked as it cut.. apparently my tube diameter is too small, and the damn thing got clogged with sawdust and killed my shop vac!

this enclosure is super similar to the one I already made, but I want to start simple and then go more elaborate once I gain more experience with the machine. 

If anyone wants me to mock up something to their dimensions, I'd be happy to do it- plus, if you have a specific idea in mind I'm flexible with that too. 

Or if you just want a fiberglass mold that will work as well :wink:

Nice work. I would have been scared as shit do that kinda carve on a complete board. The x-carve can be spastic. So far for my boards, I had 12 pieces, 7 went well, 2 have been unused, and 3 were wasted by the machine.. So basically, around 1/3 of the time, it messes up the cut. I need to spend some time this summer touching up everything, because mine needs calibration. The spindle was moving way too much and making horrible cuts last time I needed it for my lid.

[/quote]

ya, I've had one bad cut so far- 

Although it was an 11-hour long project, and my shop vac broke, so the sawdust got in all the wheels and rails, throwing off the alignment...

After cleaning the whole thing, it's back up and running perfectly fine again. 

I will say though sometimes I set the homing position, and then when I click carve it doesn't start on the right tooth pack, and instead, starts like a foot off. It's always best to test the design with no material (so carving up air) first to make sure its all good IMO!

I love this deck how much for one?

Shoot him an email, and ask for the "Phat Matson" 

it's the same price as his normal decks, so he'll probably just have you purchase one of the scarlets but make a note saying you want a Phat Matson.
