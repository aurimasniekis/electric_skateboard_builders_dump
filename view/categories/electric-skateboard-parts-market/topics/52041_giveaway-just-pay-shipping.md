Guys, i'm not making money on this. when i was looking for parts, if i wasn't 100% online all the time, i wouldn't get anything, and i didn't get them. I think it's unfair. so i will tell you who wrote first PM. then you'll decide who actually needs these parts the most. it would make sense for someone who doesn't have any parts or for a gift or something else. But here is the order of PM and what people want. Reminder I'm not parting out.
1 @DeathCookies, germany. chinese mount+ both pulleys
2 @moon, UK. calibers+wheel pulley
3 @Jreamer, calibers
4 @sk8l8r, UK. chinese mount+HK mount+wheel pulley, 
5 @Alex.Scheff, Germany. everything
6 @koralle, Germany. everything but would share mount+pulleys to @DeathCookies  

please be nice, pray to esk8 god :raised_hands:and decide without being greedy

Nice :slight_smile: i only take what i Need and will give the rest to the others. i followed your timeline and will prioritize it like that.
 
@me caliber Mount + both pulleys
@moon caliber
@sk8l8r chinese Mount
@Alex.scheff paris trucks + wheels

if that is correct i will create a pm for us about shipping but it is not that expensive (~9‚Ç¨]

David Attenborough voice: Here in the depths of the European hinterland, we came to see the common European buzzard and perhaps some other carrion eaters, what we did not expect to see was such a crowded pack of vultures over this veritable feast.

Look how even the apex predators are keeping their distance, such is the ferocity at this table.
