To get the best life from a battery it should never be fully charged or discharged. so i suppose if you completely discharge the battery every day maybe you only get the low end of 600-800 cycles instead of maybe 1000+

i just don't think people need much more on an electric skateboard.... 

here are my reasons.
1. the price of bigger batteries is a lot
2. the weight is a lot
3. fitting it on the deck whilst keeping it slim becomes a new difficult challange.
4. rarely do people need to have such greater capacity. (there are some cases but not common enough)

On the original Space Cell, when I charge to 100% and immediately unplug it, the voltage display drops down to about 87% or so. Is that considered fully charged? Should I not be charging to 100%?

Have you noticed how when riding, the voltage sags, but when you get off the board and wait a bit the voltage goes up a bit? Voltage under load (amps) is different than resting battery voltage when discharging; something similar occurs when charging.

Yup, figured that was the case. I was just wondering if fully charged meant when the display hits 100% or when the charger goes green. I'm assuming its when the charger goes green in which case, we shouldn't wait for it to go green in order get the best life from the battery. Correct?

charger has to go green, when your battery hits 100% the amperage from the charger tapers off so that at complete rest your battery is 100% charged. if you remove it from the charger when the battery says 100% then the battery goes in to rest and shows a lower capacity.

If you are trying to maximise the life of battery by using an under-charging strategy I recommend investing in a charger that is programmable and can do a precise job every time. 

Because if you are just using the LCD Screen on the SPACE cell battery it is not very accurate because it is showing a percentage only. 

The charger you should buy is this [Satiator.][1]

With the Cycle Satiator, you can program your primary profile to
give an 80% charge, and have a secondary profile that does a 100%
charge when you need full range. Then have the best of both worlds,
a battery that lasts thousands of cycles but still goes the distance
when you need it.

Man that charger's a beast thanks for sharing, although might be a little overkill for my needs. The stock charger is fine with me. I guess my question is - Charging until charger light turns green is best for the Space Cell?

@onloop I'm about to pull the trigger on this but am a little confused. The enclosure that your'e selling is just the shell that now goes on the space cell pro3 and pro4, correct? For the enclosure, you're saying it can fit 2 esc's as well. So does that mean that the space cell pro3 can also fit 2 escs inside?

@RunPlayBack - I'd assume, you can just stop charging once it get's closer to 100% or right when it hits 100% since it still charges a bit after 100%?

I've unplugged right when it hits 100% and have never waited until the charger turns green. If waiting for the charger to turn green has no effect on the health of the battery I'll do that from now on.

The NEW SPACE CELL PRO3 & PRO4 as pictured above, is a group of cells that is completely integrated with a hard case outer shell, Meaning the Li-ion 18650 cells & BMS get built/assembled directly into the shell during manufacture, the LCD Fuel Gauge, the On/Off Switch & DC charge Port are panel mounted into the shell which should make them more servicable, say if the siwtch fails. There is also room in the end for Twin VESC's & Capacitors.

**This is no longer just a battery, its the next generation of DIY electric skateboard building, Its an all-in-one universal electronics mounting solution with integrated high capacity battery, with provisions for VESC.**

ALSO, the Shell itself is available seperatly for existing owners of SPACE CELL version 1. You can partially dismantle the original SPACE Cell and panel mount the parts onto the shell however you want. Of course you could also stuff it with LIPO and hobby grade ESC if you wanted too.

Satiator is really nice but not cheap.

Let's say someone bought the larger space cell and satiator and charged to 85%. 

How much range would be expected before low voltage cutoff?

```
when light goes green It just means that the battery is fully charged. so if you are trying to maximise the life of the battery using an undercharging strategy i would use an accurate voltage meter and test the actual resting pack voltage at certain stage throughout the charge process. EXAMPLE: charge for 1hr, take note of LCD %, rest pack 10mins, check voltage. charge for another 30min, note %, rest, check V, charge for 15min, etc, etc

this way you will learn that you need to pull the charger when LCD says (example) ~93% to reach your desired charge voltage.

> charger has to go green, when your battery hits 100% the amperage from the charger tapers off so that at complete rest your battery is 100% charged. if you remove it from the charger when the battery says 100% then the battery goes in to rest and shows a lower capacity.

when you charge a battery to its max voltage you then need to hold it at that voltage as you bring the amperage down. you do this so that at complete rest the battery is as close to its max as possible.

If you never charge it until it turns green, then your cells with slowly become more out of balance with each charge (because you aren't waiting for them to be fully balanced by unplugging it at red)- so once you decide to finally wait until it's green, it may take a while.
```

## \#39 Posted by: evoheyax Posted at: 2016-03-28T17:13:49.066Z Reads: 328

```
I get that a bms normally balances the cells at the last bit of charging, so under charging will allow cells to become unbalanced and shorten the life of your battery.

But onloop says undercharging to 80% instead of to 100%, improves the life of the cells, and that charging to 100% shortens the life of your battery, which also makes sense.

So what do I do to get the max life out of my space cell?

Charge to 100% or to 80%?

You're doing best! compared to the others!!!!! *big respect to all your activities!* I would like and it would me pleasing to meet you anytime. You're warming welcome in Switzerland any time!
I got father too - a time ago... Your concept with resellers is interesting (for some good guys out there - like longhairedboy -  good guy as much I read!)

Let me give you a little feedback - in the good way!

Make more things opensource, and give the good guys out there more transparency. Gibe me the chance to make a p.e. : 
http://hartzivmoebel.blogspot.ch/ or
the whole FabLab Project startet with the MIT (you know what that means - for all other: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab)

We all should get together and help us!

I'm an electronic technician and now a cheap system engineer (who cares again ?!) and it would appreciate to help!

best regards and do further nice stuff like this!

Do the tough cases also have room to encase two VESC's in addition to the cells? 

Just wondering since the external dimensions of the pro3 and pro4 are the same, yet the pro3 theoretically has more internal free space with less cells.

@onloop seeing all these delayed responses is poor CS and ultimately disappointing. I understand how hard it is for you to run this by yourself but at least be transparent. What is your realistic timetable? Saying "No not yet" "still being made" is just dodging the questions. You've offered a refund for your products but that again dodges the problem. I purchased knowing there'd be a high possibility that the items will be delayed due to past issues. That being said, it's slightly disheartening coming back to this site every few days hoping to see an updated timetable only to be given the above responses instead.

fuck... you impatient bastards.... (that's a joke, sort of)

I'm literally only a few days overdue, that's pretty good considering my normal track record... 

There were some issues with the original design, I had to redesign it, so yes delays.... ALSO, i can't get battery samples into Australia ATM so its fricken complicated.... how do I test it?

this is a completely unique product that has never been made before... shit takes time.

& I prefer not to rush it too hard and end up with a pile of shit...

Welcome to the world of product innovation & small scale manufacturing...... actually, the problem of delays is fairly common industry wide at the moment!

Calling it bad Customer Service is a bit unfair... do you suggest I write a post in here each day say "no news today" is that good customer service? I know my communications need to improve but my resources are limited.

**In the mean time, go check the 4 or 5 most recent 'successful' Kickstarter campaigns... they have raised over 2 million dollars and mostly they don't have any products on the streets...** 

I run this business from my garage, i work just a few days each week, technically i am a stay home dad & i don't have several hundred thousands of dollars in backing, i don't have a dedicated marketing team or a team of customer service representatives....... But I definitely do have products that are real & in stock, you can buy them and have them delivered to your door quickly...I do have a track record for delivering great products. I also have many new products under development that are fucking awesome too, they cannot be purchased anywhere in the entire world.... so if you like them & want to be the first in the world to have them sometimes you need to be patient... please.

So yeah I apologise sometimes my stuff is delayed... I am trying my best, please don't be so f'n critical it won't speed things up... 

What many of you probably don't realise is all advertised due dates are made up, they are a guess. it is actually impossible to predict the completion date... IMPOSSIBLE! 

ALSO, when you ask me "what date something will be ready?", that is also a made up answer... I have no idea when something will be ready.. I cannot predict the future... impossible questions result in made up answers.

However, I am very happy to answer questions about function & performance, they are questions that can actually be answered, real answers!..... 

**so my advice is talk amongst yourselves and enjoy the wait...**


_P.S. sorry for coming across like a total wanker..._

So, i just re-read my reply, I sounded like an arrogant dick...

I was going to edit the reply & try to make it sound nicer...

But then i realised i probably just need to further explain my state of mind at the moment......

SO here goes;

Some days I spend the entire day talking with suppliers! Literally non-stop, the entire day or 2 or 3!

discussing precise details to ensure things are made according to spec, trying to explain why I had to change a design, Or being told to change my design due to manufacturing limitations & constraints... the list of task goes on & on

Developing a product from scratch is very complex & can take between 4-6 months of work min! 

At any given time i could be trying to develop 3 or 4 new products! There is lots of work & lots of waiting!

This can be extremely frustrating! So I fully understand why my customers also get frustrated from waiting.... of course you guys would like a date for delivery! I understand! I want to get the product made & delivered to you asap!


The fact of the matter is, I can spend hours & hours trying to get a product made on time & on spec, but it really doesnt matter......

Some shit just doesn't work out on time, some delays just happen, They are unpredicatable & uncontrolable...

sometimes i just need to wait & trust that my factory will get the job done as fast as they can! Me asking them each day for an update becomes pointless...

the waiting continues......

Onloop - this enclosure looks super smooth !! One question - is the battery easily swappable ? I was thinking of getting 10s4p aswell as one more additional smaller 6s battery that I could take on a plane. Is it possible to quickly swap the batteries inside ?

Thanks for the update @onloop, appreciate it. Having worked in customer service myself in the past, I can kind of understand where @Haick is coming from and to some extent he has a point.

There's no denying that designing a completely new product takes a a lot of time, energy and often delays are common, I doubt he was trying to dispute that and I don't either. However, the particular wording on the new space cell product pages "Shipping from 20th Apr 2016" sound a lot more like a concrete date rather than just a guess as to when they'll be ready. 

If you're a customer who's already put down the $500 or so based on the assumption that the product will be ready around the date that is stated on the page then I don't think it's unreasonable to be expecting an update when the advertised date has passed, even just a simple "Hey guys, unfortunately the batteries aren't ready yet and I don't have any info regarding when they will be ready at this stage but I'll be sure to provide an update as soon as I do." will probably keep most people happy.

Glad you've been able to give us a bit more info though, looks like it's coming along nicely :)

Also, on a lighter note, I've had my board up and running for the last few days now and I have to say, these things are fucking awesome! I've racked up around 50km of riding since the weekend and it's been a tonne of fun. Have had plenty of odd/confused looks from people as I'm riding up hills. Really appreciate all the work you've put into your products, keep up the good work :)

"Shipping from 20th Apr 2016"
[/quote]

in my defense, shipping "from" means any date from 20th...

it does not mean orders will ship on 20th.

next time ill write shipping "sometime after" 

because i will never be able to define an exact date I can only give a "from" date. This is basically a guess of the quickest possible time frame (normally it is the date my factory tells me)`. I probably should state the longest possible time frame, but then that could be completely wrong too.

ALSO, on the 22nd April (Friday) I did provide an update on this forum with information saying they are still being made....

then it was a holiday weekend here for 3 days, sat, sun, Monday.... nonwork days. (my factory also doesn't work on weekends either)

today is Tuesday here, I don't (not meant to) work because I have my boy on Tuesday & Wednesday....

So if I was going to do an official update it would be this Thursday, 2 days from now. & the answer might be very different than that answer I gave on Tuesday, but I will have to wait and see. Anything can happen.

I will be surely having a detailed & lengthy discussing with the several factories involved in this product & ask them what is causing delays.

I have now also found out today (yes I was working instead of looking after my son), that batteries can be shipped to Australia again, so I decided to ask for a final sample to be (made) & sent, this will ad some delays also, it needs to be sent & across the globe than tested, i suppose i could rely on my factory for testing but thats risky business.

if I'm lucky ill get that in around 7 days. but it could be 10 days. 

It could take 3-4 days before I can test it & make any final revisions (if needed), so this is potentially 14 days of delays.... 14 days that i will not have any "news" or "updates" 

Sometimes when I feel that I am under lots of pressure to deliver, I might also feel pressured to skip the thorough testing process & try to meet my deadlines... however this could be a disastrous.... i think most people would prefer a fault free product.

if possible i wish that everyone would wait patiently, in reality I know it can't happen... 

everyone wants their eboard urgently.

@onloop I completely understand where you're coming from and there's a reason why i decided to essentially buy a raptor from you sans the deck and remote. I want to support you because I believe you're doing great things for this community. That being said, you're still a business that is going to be held to high standards from a consumer standpoint. 

Seeing as though you are a one man shop and need funding for your products before placing orders to mitigate your financial risk; I empathize with the position it puts you in. A suggestion I'd make to at least create more transparency between you and the customer would be to set more realistic shipping goals. A different approach similar to what you noted above could be a message along the lines of "Still in prototyping and production phase. Expect to ship within 3 months and hopefully sooner". This would put a lot less stress on you and allow you time to focus on meeting a more realistic goal.

Again, I really am excited to get my products and ultimately just want to stop having to push! :smiley:

thanks for the kinds words.....

I just think some people are being a bit unreasonable, I'm probably only about 2 weeks overdue...so my "guess" wasn't too bad.....

I personally think this result is pretty good considering the design changed mid-production & it was not possible to get samples into the country (Australia) for testing until just this week.

if i over quote the time frame too far people won't actually buy the product, then I can't afford to buy in larger qty & so my prices end up being higher... which also means people don't want to buy... essentially all i'm doing is a group buy, i show what is available & people give me money so i can make it a reality.

now to makes matters worse i have people demanding to get their money back after I already spent so much time working to build their batteries for them....  there is really no love in this game at the moment.... 

unfortunately, the "Give my shit NOW or f-u attitude" is really catching on around here....

Also, you should give the different space cells spacey names like quasar, pulsar or omicron persei 8...

the old space cell should (haven't done it, but based on measurements) fit inside this, if you own an old space cell & want this case you should disassemble the space cell, remove the PVC shrink, and panel mount the LCD, switch & charge port.

IMO: One thing you might suggest to customers is to use some heat to get the plastic to "relax" over the curve. With a hair dryer or proper heat gun, you could probably get it to form just a little bit to the surface contour.

The Pro3 didn't require as much extra work because it resembles our previous space cell setup, which has been around for more than a year now. There are some slight obvious changes, but the base model has been established. 

The Pro4 was an entirely new layout, so we are making sure to test it thoroughly incase there are any design flaws. So far, so good!

The Space Cell Pro 3 has fever cells at the same size. Initially I thought there will be more room for VESCs and shit but I was surprised (as there were no pictures available) that this is not the case. 
Instead it has some wasted space at the other end which doesn't make sense (beside it's easier to manufacture)
So I cut it off to make it fit my shorter wheelbase.
In case there will be a new version in the future, it would be good if they come from the factory with a smaller enclosure, then the SP3 do have an advantage for smaller boards.
