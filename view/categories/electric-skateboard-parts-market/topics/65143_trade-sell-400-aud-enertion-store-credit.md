Hi! As the title states, I'm trying to trade/sell my 400 AUD store credit for money or new/used esk8 parts. I'm about to start my second build so pretty much open to whatever items you guys have!

Just for reference, 400 AUD will get you the Focbox unity with Warranty. You need to pay to shipping though. I ended up getting in on the group buy as time isn't too sensitive for my next build.
