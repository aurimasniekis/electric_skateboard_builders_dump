Hi all,

Here in Belgium and the Netherlands, I am one off the guys behind the Facebook group & page (ESK8.eu). I try to organize rides in Belgium and the Netherlands. Because it is nice to have a sweater for the entire group, I will open a groupbuy.

Maybe some guys in the EU are interested in also such a sweater.

btw: Prices of the sweaters of 40 euros can fall if a few people order the same color

@pjotr47 if people in the us want some maybe you want to collab? i have a screen printer a few blocks from my house that could make these shirts and sweaters at a great price! (Prob. 7-15$ on the tshirts and 15-25$ on the sweatshirts)
