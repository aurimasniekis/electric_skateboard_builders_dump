I got these lipos then decided to just go with a giant pack of 18650
They're unused. Came in the mail within the month for the zippy and within the last week for the  Multistar

(4) 3s Zippy compact 4500mah. 25c
(4) 3s Multistar 5200 10c 


These are the two thinnest 3s packs findable without spending a fortune on a-spec nanotech

These would be 60$ for the multistar and 120$ for the zippy compact...take them all for 150$
I won't ship them
