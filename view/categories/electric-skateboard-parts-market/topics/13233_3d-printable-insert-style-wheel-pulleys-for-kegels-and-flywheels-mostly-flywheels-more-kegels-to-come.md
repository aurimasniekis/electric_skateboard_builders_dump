I really like using insert style pulleys, for a number of reasons. They keep the belts better aligned, they look cleaner aethetically, and they're easy to swap out. The biggest trade off is the truck hanger modification that's required, but it only takes about 20 minutes and its totally worth it. 

So i paid a guy in Canada to design me some so i could use them in my builds. Thanks to his willingness to take my money, I now have models for the following:

10mm 33 tooth for Flywheels and clones
13mm 33 tooth for Flywheels and clones

10mm 34 tooth for Flywheels and clones
13mm 34 tooth for Flywheels and clones

10mm 35 tooth for Flywheels and clones
13mm 35 tooth for Flywheels and clones

10mm 37 tooth for Flywheels and clones
13mm 37 tooth for Flywheels and clones

10mm 38 tooth for Flywheels and clones
13mm 38 tooth for Flywheels and clones

and last but not least...

32 tooth for kegels in both 10mm and 13mm sizes. 

So now kegels are an easy DIY upgrade option for your gen 1 raptors and all you have to do is get pulleys, kegels, and some f608ZZs from amazon. Or chop your calibers and use them on your own build. 

**Two things you need to do to use any of these insert style wheel pulleys:**

**1)** get some F608ZZ flanged bearings from Amazon:
https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=f608zz
They're dirt cheap and come by the 10 pack. 

**2)** chop your truck hangers (unless you're on a Raptor, which are already chopped for these kinds of pulleys) I have video on doing this for Evolve kegal pulleys. For my pulleys you need to take off 8mm of aluminum. You have to take more than that off for evolve pulleys which are a pain in the ass because the pulleys  also have to be chopped, but that's not relevant here.

Right now the only place i have them is on my shapeways store because the only way i can get them out there is to put them there for now. I have plans to have these injection molded in black nylon, starting with the Kegel pulleys. That's still in the shopping phase at the moment so for now my Shapeways shop is the only place to get them. I know the prices are kind of high but it is shapeways, afterall... and i'm also trying to raise some money for motors, steel motor pulleys, mounts for Ronins, reliable e-switches, and other R&D stuff I have in the works.

YES these pulleys hold up. I've been testing the kegel and flywheel prints on my own board for a couple of months now. They work well and wear well. And they sound good, too.

The only reason i want to do nylon injection molded versions instead of sticking with these is because i want to bring the retail price down to under $20 per unit and offer free shipping to the US. So by buying these and trying them out you'll be helping me do that.

I don't think they are supposed to be new sizes, they're just oversized in width by 1mm so the 9mm & 12mm belts have a little wiggle room.

10mm surface area is for 9mm belts, the 13mm surface area is for 12mm belts. 

If you are using an enertion drive system, you can use your existing belts with these. I've got the kegal ones on an enertion drive system in the picture.

@longhairedboy you should also do the flywheel snapin pulleys. I'll give you the designs and modify them for free. I'll put your branding on it too :D. Just hoping to buy them for cheap in the USA. What do you say?

It is.  There is one slight  difference being that the ones posted used a flanged bearing like those that are found in enertion 36t flywheel pulleys. Which means if you use modified trucks for enertion drive train parts,  these are now interchangeable if you buy a baggy of bearings. With the benefit of getting to chose a more custom gearing or possibly the Kegels instead on your enertion builds

Yes,  @mishrasubhransu use 608 bearings.  But his pulleys also look like they extend past the back of the wheel a bit from looking at his original post.  I think,  unless it's changed or unless I'm completely off and it was just all the colors messing with my eyes.

I used regular 608 bearings, but can easily be modified for the flanged ones. What the advantage of using a  flange bearing here?

```
If you use a normal bearing, like on yours,  you see the thin film that holds it in place,  like a disk that is attached to the pulley.  It's probably 1mm thick?    That ring you have even though you engaged the full frontal face of the bearing, it's only attached to the rest of the pulley by the radial area of where it meets the rest of it.  That 1mm x 22pi area is what is taking the load on your pulley in terms of axial loading, apply a lot of torque and the belt will try to pry the pulley put and away from the hub. So that's taking lateral forces which keep the pulley in place. 

The profile of a flanged bearing is 22mm diameter,  7mm width with a 1.5mm thick flange and its 25mm in diameter that comes back onto the bearing itself.  So you get 1.5mm of flange at 25mm and 5.5 mm of bearing at 22mm. So you have all the material at 25mm x 5.5mm thick holding in your pulley.  This is made possible because on these pulleys,  like enertions,  the flange is on the inside and it sandwiches the entire width of the pulley (where the bearing is placed) between the flange and the hub. 

So long story short your pulley isn't going anywhere anytime soon with LHB pulleys.

Does'nt cutting part of hanger OFF weaken the axle ??,...now the wheel is at the end of a longer bare unreinforced axle ??

And how do you cut hanger to get a perfectly 90Â° cut to axle<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/8/88fbb9c90319b900e9328c9968664d8f332c53ee.png" width="690" height="388">

It's such a small part of the hangar, it has minimal effect on integrity. I haven't heard of anything bending their axle due to chopping off some of the hangar.

I cut by eye with a dremel. Just guestimate for 90 degrees when I start cutting, then just follow through with that cut all the way around. Hasn't failed me yet!

I actually thought Enertions new wheel was it , but emailed again and they said no.

Just using rough numbers since I don't actually know how thick you made that disk thing.  Assuming 1mm  Vs standard dimensions of the flanged bearing quoted. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/6/363da2ef65e73bfb0aa71db28a903adc0062803a.jpg" width="281" height="500">

@Randyc1 cutting off a 7-8 mm portion  of the hanger does weaken the impact the structurally integrity of the axel however it's not much.  
Here's another hand drawn explanation. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/5/453e45c6b724b2006024872931eab5e9ec7acb27.jpg" width="281" height="500">

You can see that the effective moment on the axel,  F is actually  brought in by half of the amount cut off,  here equivalent to B the thickness of the bearing.  But if we examine the affects that this has on the individual components of F,  on the axel,  relative to the plane of the end of the hanger we can see three things. 

The first is that the force on the inner bearing doesn't change.  It will always be 1/2 B at a force of F/2. 

The second is that the effective force is actually brought in by 1/2 B relative to the center of the hanger but relative to the perpendicular plane to axel,  we've moved out by 1/2 B.  So there is still the same overall force being applied but we've increased the moment at this point. 

Lastly,  you see the end force is also translated by 1/2 B,  in reading the moment seen here due to the same weight. 

With that being said, these things come with a fairly high factor of safety.  They are meant to be ridden on and meant to experience great impact forces as well as fatigue.  All these things have been accounted for in their design,  I would know,  I do this stuff at school and at my workplace for the past year and almost three quarters.  You're just going to end up reducing the factor of safety from say 3 to a 2.8 or 2.7, it's so small it's insignificant. 

Especially once you consider  that once you go electric,  you're not invited g your board all over the place and doing crazy jumps with it.  Unless you're onloop and you're showing your board doing an ollie  or kickflip but oven then that's nothing compared to what it's meant to endure. Hope that helps.

[/quote]

Yes, they are 3D printed by Shapeways. I'm not sure exactly what plastic it is, but its tough. After some googling i found this datasheet hosted by Shapeways for thier Strong & Flexible Plastic which they claim is structural and can be used for anything from iphone cases to drone bodies and even stuff like this. Here's the datasheet, its something called PA 2200: https://www.shapeways.com/rrstatic/material_docs/mds-strongflex.pdf

Testing these things had very good results. I've been riding around on them for a while now and they're tough. I dug a few tiny sharp rocks out of the teeth and discovered that they hadn't pitted the pulley, just the belt. Crushed plant matter had no affect on them. Belt rubbing on the wheel is a complete non issue because of the flange, and the flange seems to handle belt misalignment rather well as the belt doesn't seem to wear the flange much at all when misaligned. 

Then I went one step further and loosened my motor mount a little so that it would do that thing where it starts to creep over towards the pulley so that i could test how well they handle the scraping against the motor plate bolts. Nylon pulleys handle this very well, they just kind of start to smear and melt a little but no real damage, so i was wondering how well these would handle it. I discovered that the pulley would actually start to shave when rubbing against the plate bolts, so the result was kind of like peeling, but the peeling made a noise that let you know what was up, but didn't provide the kind of rolling resistance that the injection molded variants produce when the injection points start to hammer against the bolt heads. Once the mounting clamp was put back where it belongs the shaving stopped and after tearing off the shavings i rode around a lot more to see if that damage would trigger more peeling after more heavy use. It did not continue. 

As a result of that i also discovered that shapeways prints everything in white plastic then dyes the part to the color ordered. They don't actually use colored plastic. They mention that on their site also apparently.

Yes. The per unit cost after the mold fee is shockingly low, but the tooling/mold fee... well lets just say i've made lower down payments on cars. I'll have to move a lot of these to justify it, which is why i'm starting with the one that i feel the community would want the most. The only option right now for insert pulleys on kegels is to buy one from Evolve and chop it. Also the Evolve pulleys require a removal of a shocking 18mm of aluminum form the hanger which in my opinion is a bit much. I've got two boards out there like that, and the hangers are doing fine, but i'd much rather remove 8mm than 18mm. And without chopping the belt surface town to 10mm from 16mm using a chop saw.

@Jinra

These are made of a special grade of [Nylon](https://www.anubis3d.com/documents/sls/datasheets/PA2200-Polyamide-White.pdf) specifically designed for 3D printing. Linked is the full data sheet from EOS sourced by a local company that does this stuff near me.

It's printed using an [SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering)  3D printing process that yields incredibly strong parts both physically in nature as well as in properties. There is no "layers" once the part is printed. It is in the literal sense on the word, **one** part. Because of this, the material acts uniformly in all directions resulting in no one weak plain or direction in the print. Meaning you have a solid and incredibly tough print. This is not your desktop 3D printer you have at home, it's commercial grade and meant for serious abuse and forces.
 
PETG and ABS last a couple hundred miles if not more under [FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling) which is what all home printers use, unless you have one with a resin tank which uses a laser to print in fine detail [(SLA or Stereolithography)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography) but these tend to be more for models that require extreme detail and not so much physical strengths). The thing with FDM is that here you do have layers visibly present and the material acts like it. Your material properties will not be constant in all directions, you will have weak shear plains in between the layers which is why it's important to print at or as close to 100% so maximize those areas of contact.

sintered nylon. So far they've been very, very tough. I've only had one break while it was on a board and it was clearly defective, and i've tested and used dozens of them. I've deliberately broken others to see how they break. they're not the typical 3D prints for sure.
