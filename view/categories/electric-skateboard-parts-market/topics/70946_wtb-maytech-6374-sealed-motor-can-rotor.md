I have a working maytech sealed 6374 stator and a damaged rotor (multiple broken magnets) and am hence looking for just the rotor (the part with the magnets).

If any of you have a Maytech 6374 sealed motor can (rotor), do let me know. 

Alternatively, id purchase the whole motor if it's spoilt and you don't know what to do with it.
