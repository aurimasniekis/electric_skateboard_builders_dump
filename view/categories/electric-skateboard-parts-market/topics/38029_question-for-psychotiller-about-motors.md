I am interested in buying one of these two...

(1) The smaller motor 6355 has more watts 3520W+  = I want the one with more power.  Also a bit confused why the smaller motor has more power.

(2) How long is the sensor wire?  Does it work well with VESC6?  I have had issue with some other motors hall sensors.

I thought it would be helpful for everyone + him (free advertising). I buy tons of stuff from builders/vendors here.

But do you know about the motors? They are the standard Maytech brand so this maybe more public knowledge rather than something specific to his website. Just need a quick reply... I am at the point of purchase.

Thx!

No sorry, it looks like a mistake because to me it's like saying a 6374 motor is weaker then a 6355. But everything is possible @psychotiller

According to the specs at the Maytech website the 6365 is rated at 3520 max watt and the 6355 at 3510 watt.

Ok thanks yes that's what i saw on michobby too. So it must have been a typo.

6365 >= 6355

It's a typo. Not mine, but they wouldn't change the info so I left it alone as well. And, so you know the stator is longer. The 6365 are actually 6369

Thanks for the info ... 69mm might hit the truck... the outer edge.

Quick follow-up are they both about the same power then? Due to that size I would be limited to 6355.

They are very close. I weigh 200lbs (210) and the 6355s are plenty powerful.
