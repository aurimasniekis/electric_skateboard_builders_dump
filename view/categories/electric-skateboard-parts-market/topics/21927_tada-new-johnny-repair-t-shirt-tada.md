Hey Guys.... 

I've been working on this little project for over a month now, and finally receive my sample, which are completely Awesome :grin:. I was looking for a way to not only promote myself (but why not also do it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) , but the esk8 DIY scene in general. @Michaelinvegas start about a month the #esk8squad, and now it's my time to jump aboard the train with those Johnny Repair T-shirt.

These are 6 new original design, that every one can bought and customize a bit (changing the colour of the shirt and the graphic, the type of shirt, the placement, ... ).
