11/11 is carnival in China and a lot of companies are offerring discounts on their products. 
For example maytech on taobao is offering 6355 for 403 yuan= 54 euro, and vesc for 400yuan =53 euro.
Rush to pay what you want before midnight (chinese time) and you will discuss shipping tomorrow. (btw they speak english)
