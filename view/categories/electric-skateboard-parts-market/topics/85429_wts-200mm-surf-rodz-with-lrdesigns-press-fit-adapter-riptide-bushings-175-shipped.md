SOLD!

Selling my extra set of surf rodz with 70mm axles for $175 shipped. Comes with 45 degree black and 50 degree red baseplate, riptide barrel bushings and pivot cups, bearings, and @lrdesigns press fit adapters installed. Please read below the pictures for critical information on condition. Also, I added 2 10mm spacers for the red baseplate truck after taking pictures.

Critical information:
- To use the press fit adapters, you must either cut your own motor plates or buy them from Janux/@marcmt88. I think just motor plates is around $100, but you'll have to ask him yourself.
- red 50 degree baseplate is ridden for < 15 miles, but has scratches from installation. 
- Both hangars are unridden (outside of my bedroom). \
- some of the bearings are unridden, some were ridden for < 15 miles
- one of the press fit adapters have marks from an attempt to remove them, but no functionality has been lost.
- spacers are a mix of new and old, so some have scratches.
- I believe the pink bushings are riptide APS 87.5a and the white are Krank 87a based on the pictures from their website.

These have @lrdesigns press fit adapters ($50)  plus riptide bushings and pivot cups ($30-40), hence why theyâ€™re above retail.

Not at all when you consider the $50 press fit adapters.

Can we not rag on pricing on every WTS post? Buyers market here.
