Concerning. What's the gearing ratio. Whose the maker. What kv are the motors. Who made the motors. Are they abec wheels. Why's shipping so expensive to the us.....?

Intresting. 
45km/h seems pretty fast for a single motor setup.
What trucks are they?

The lack of info is a little concerning.

$100 Shipping for sea freight? That's crazy. That doesn't look like a well known motor. You need to provide more specs. Also, that motor gear looks weird.

Enertion achieves 45km/h with 1 motor its not hard for other motor manufactures to achieve similar results. 

Alloy trucks.

$200 AU for 3 trucks with motors shipped to US is a bargain in comparison to Enertion and any other brand.

Unlike Enertion metal is used rather than plastic.

If you're looking for an exotic build with high performance components capable of high speeds and long range, you can have it far below $2000 I assure you unless you want your box sculpted like a vampire's rib cage or some crazy shit. But you will be spending more than this on a drive system.

without KV, gear ratios, and many other important facts being stated, this is such a risky buy...

45kph is doable, but with what voltage and what amerage? Are these made for 6s or 12s? someone would need to know before buying them..

second, regardless of whether or not you support Enertion you know their motors are good quality: everybody loves the tacon motors as well, and they have clearly proved themselves. These motors on the other hand are still a blank page.

That's a 15t motor pulley and probably 36t hub. there's no bearing in the hub.

I'm guesstimating 83mm wheels at most, and anything less than 10s capable is a toy, and we don't build toys.

so, if it's 10s, 15/36, 83mm wheels, and 45kph, the motor must be 215kv.
BUT, those motors seem to have sensor wires!

Provide sensor pinout, provide KV, provide max voltage/amperage, wheel size/duro, and be realistic with the shipping.

If you cannot provide these things, meh, I'll give you $50 each and YOU pay shipping to USA.


EDIT: I didn't see the 70mm wheels info, that puts the motors at 265kv. That belt/wheel clearance is deceiving in the pic.

Now now children I realize the demographic that rides an electric skateboard is under the age of 13 so you can leave your child like comments at the playground 

If your not interested thats fine, jump on your little skateboard and keep riding home to mumma for your next cup of breast milk. 


pm me if you want to make an offer. 
Shit talkers can circle jerk together.

We always said that we need specs of the setup but you did not tell shit....

Most people on this forum are above 13... maybe everyone?

Maybe you shouldn't act like a child and tell us what you wanna sell...

And if you spend some time on this forum then you will realize that we are building "rockets" and not toys!

Guys see attached spec page. These serfdom the iWonder skateboard out of China. Not sure why ohmboy didn't just give up those specs. 

They are either the 270 or 360kv 1200w.

From his replies I also gathered he thinks parts are parts and generally we are all just a bunch of idiots that will buy pretty much any shit for any price that anyone's selling. -Who bought and is now sitting on a bunch of shit parts though?

agreed- this guy sounds super incompetent and uneducated about our forum... just by the tone of his replies after we simply asked for specs shows his true motives. 

haha I don't even think we have a single member under 13 on here! youngest is probably lox, and he has gotten super educated about everything in these past few months!
