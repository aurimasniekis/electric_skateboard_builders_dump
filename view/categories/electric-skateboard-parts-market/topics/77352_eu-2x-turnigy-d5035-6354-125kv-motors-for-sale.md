So heres the deal. I snabbed these on a great price (~ 95 euros for both) . was an impulse buy for my trampa build but the KV is way too low but might be good for someone whos doing real off roading.

I am going to send these back on monday but just noticed they have increased in price so I figured if someone here wants them at the discounted price I paid, I might as well forward my discount to the community. Here is my receipt.

Just convert the pounds to euros and add shipping and its yours.

They almost 50% more expensive now
