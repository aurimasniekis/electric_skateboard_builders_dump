I have ABS Enclosures for sale. I am a one man show. Not a business so, I would prefer to use Ebay if that's alright. 

Made in my shop from 1/8" Vacuum molded ABS sheet.
Middle will hold 2 up to 2 4s 10ah Lipo batteries (MultiStar High Capacity) or 2 6s 5ah Zippy Compacts. ESC area can fit the Castle XL2 or any other 1/8 or 1/5th scale car esc. I added an extra space in front of the batteries for other electronics (bec, on/off switch, charge ports, led...etc.)
Batteries and other mentioned electronics are not included.

This case comes trimmed. and ready to install. You can velcro it or fasten it to your board with t-nuts and screws (not included)  If you fasten this enclosure with screws it will conform to the shape of your deck. Concave is not an issue. It is slightly flexible material so if your board is a little flexible it shouldn't be a problem. 

If you would like an enclosure made to your exact specifications let me know. I can make a mold for $80.

Got a model going today for the S.P.A.C.E. battery. Tried to add some concave to the mold. It may work better to just leave it flat..What do you guys think?

I'm really digging that strappy steampunkish design in the plastic. How wide is that compared to the SPACE cell? It looks like there's plenty of room on either side of the pack if it was in the middle. 

Can we see it cut and mounted? Man you're really making me want to get some ABS sheets. Too bad a blew up my ESC this weekend or i'd get some and try this out finally.

Down the middle it is 430mm long x 153mm wide x 25mm depth
I put a wider deeper section at either end to maybe accomodate DD set ups or of course DR.
@Onloop because of my oven size I cant squeeze much more length- Please let me know if you don't think these dimensions will work...

Those sections are 200mm wide x 31mm deep
 This was just a run so I could see it. I'm going to make some adjustments.

@lhb I'll get it cut and cleaned up, maybe mount it to a deck tonight. Thanks!

Yeah, But it's not a straight box shape. It takes time to sand and shape these molds. It would just be $80. That's what I charge for a custom mold which will include your enclosure shipped to you. All in all, Not a problem. Let me ask you this though. Where are you planning on putting your receiver, esc(s) and wiring?

actually on the esc side it needs to be straight not on an angle, sorry Ive forgot about that, so less work for you, also I think there should be an hole for the wiring 
to go over the motor. Ok so lets recap;
-475mm x146mm x 30mm, this is the right size after remeasuring it,
-front side at 45 degrees angle or so, the back straight 90 degrees with wiring hole in the middle
-14 mm ledge for screw holes
what do you think???

I definitely like the shiny look better. If I decide to order from @psychotiller, I'll want the shiny side out. @psychotiller, how do you recommend attaching your enclosures to the board? Standard skateboard nuts and bolts? Screws? I'm sure you recommend a stiff board vs a more flexible board.

I've been using these really nice stainless button head wood screws lately. But, the most secure fool proof set up is going to be with t-nuts and screws. With t-nuts you end up with pre threaded holes and they stay threaded.

That's what I use on my box too. I really like them and of course they don't rust and always stay great looking. 

I agree about the t-nuts though. eventually wood screws will strip the hole and lose thier grip, so t-nuts and machine screws are the best long-term option. 

@psychotiller let me know if you find a good source online for those. I'm going to need a bag of them eventually.

Ok, just give me few days, I got to put everything together, hopefully without any inconvenient, I'll be done by next Friday. Also I'm planning to cover the enclosure with a nice 3d carbon fiber vinyl layer,  lets see..... 
Btw, I've seen on the chat above, you mentioned about getting t-nuts for the enclosure, I've been looking for them for a while, without any luck. 
I'm not really an expert on skateboard tweaks,  so I was planning to  just drill holes one  the deck for some black  Countersunk t-nuts, that would avoid the all removing and reapplying griptape, but is impossible to find them. 
Any suggestions where to find them or a better way? <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/118608e09db111ea443fe101b9bdbdf1eeee4d1f.png" width="188" height="500">

Here's a Version 2 of my original enclosure. It will hold up to 2 4s 10ah multistar packs or 2 6s compact 6s lipo packs. The big change is it will also hold 2 1/8 or 1/5 scale ESC's!

@sgaana You would just need to dremel or cut out the appropriate holes for your accessories.

Man, you are doing an awesome work! Those enclosures are incredible!

Can you do fully costomized (like something that would perfectly fit all the component all across the board?)
What would be the price including shipping to France?

Thanks! @yendi  I could definitely do it. My only limitation is my oven so my enclosures are limited to about 17". I am charging $80 bucks to do custom molds. That includes 1 enclosure and then I keep the mold for future use.  Shipping to France, I believe, is $25 to $30 usd.  What you could do would be to lay your components out on your board and take some measurements. A photo would help too. 
Then we can start working on an enclosure :smile:

Hi @psychotiller , 

Do you think your enclosure can fit t 2x of these Lipo 6S or they're too big? http://www.aliexpress.com/item/XXL-22-2V-5000mAh-50C-6S-6-Cell-Max-55C-LiPo-Battery-22-2-Volt-for/32389994950.html 

Dimensions: 158 mm x 45  mm x 53 mm

Many thanks, 
Francesco

p.s. if you want you can check my build here, as you can see it's pretty barebone :slight_smile:  and I'm currently searching for an enclosure: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mkv-build-enertion-6372-motor-and-kit-100a-hobbytech-e-skate-esc-koston-deck-lipo-6s-5a-old-hub-motors-build/2298?u=makevoid

I have several enclosures available. Lots of different shapes. This one would work perfectly though:

The first attempt at "vacuum cleaner" enclosures...and it's coming out great....

Just used an old Enertion enclosure for a 6s battery, some Tupperware laying in the garage and threw on my kid rake for the beach....BOOM.... An enclosure and an tough clear one at that... Should look cool if I paint and light it right....but gonna go for a different shape...gotta look around the house lol ...Maybe I'll vacuum form the other halfs bra....and use that as an enclosure 😜

Yup I already have made enclosures for both of those packs. Torque bought one. Also, for the 10s3p the 21" low-profile is the nicest "most efficient" enclosure out there!

Tearing it down this weekend. I've been really busy with my day job lately and I've been dispatched super far away too. We bought a new house in lake forest and will be setting up shop there in the coming week. 
Check my website for updates .
Wheels, lights, motors, pulleys,2.4 Ghz Mini Remotes, and newly designed mounts are coming! And with a little convincing I think McCloed will be making battery packs with bms and charge port.

If you are in the US. It would be $60 shipped. Any where else you have to pay shipping

Any chance of making something to fit the DIYelectricskateboard 12s3p pack? dimensions are:
21" W: 5.25" H: 1.75"

So im thinking something along the lines of the RunPlayBack enclosure size to allow two VESCs and Rx board. 
His are as follows:
Exterior Dimensions: L: 23.5" W: 8" H: 1.75" 
Interior Dimensions: L: 21" W: 5.25" H: 1.75"

As you can see they are just a bit too narrow for the 12s3p pack.... If you cannot do longer than 17" how about a two piece?

Make your mould with the bottom piece on it. You don't need that much area on the bottom. Look at psychotillers enclosures.
