Mounted GT trucks on sidewinders, ollin 200kv's fit perfectly. I did have to rotate the motor mounts though as they hit the kicktail. rotated about 30 degrees and added an additional locking bolt.

the ollin motor shafts were too big to use with the all terrain tyres so I cut them down a bit.

It will only be 2wd, and I'm custom machining all of the parts so it only uses 2 trucks. Should keep the cost down a bit, but you know how these things go!

Ok..... so ready to part out whatever.... 10s5p 30q's like 4 cycles on them. No vescs can ship with a diyeboard dual esc but i dont like those escs personally. Has 2 racestar 140kvs on it now. Hoped that would help with the aggressive throttle response of the esc. But it really doesnt. Also has an evolve gt AT setup on it. Idk $1000 aud? Whats it worth people?
