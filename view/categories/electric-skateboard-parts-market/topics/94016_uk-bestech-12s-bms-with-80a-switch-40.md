Used but working Bestech BMS for 12s Li-ion cells.
Also includes 80A continuous current E-switch.
Has original and unused balance cables.

Note: Discoloration on the back is caused by heat from balance resistors.

Did you just test it the one time?  That's a fair amount of discoloration

No this is the BMS from my main main board and was used daily for all of last summer.

Im selling it cause im building a new board with the unity (integrated power switch) so have brought a smaller charge only bms.

I Made it, took long time on a cheep <£250 CNC but i guess times not a problem when its doing the work for you. Probably still quicker and stronger than printing it.

Not sure if I want to break this build yet. I guess if someone else wants the other parts I could split it. 

FETs anyone? Maybe just a heat sync?
