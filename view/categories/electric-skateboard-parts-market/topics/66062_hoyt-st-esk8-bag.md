Those motor mounts look bad ass with the auto tensioner. I'd try a set. Although expensive and deservingly so, the quality looks exceptional and the 3 separate 90wh batteries that hook up together and be separated for airline travel is genius. I can see all the boosted guys jumping on this. They need a bit of advertising and the ability to pump these out and they can be a market leader.

Problem is you rarely see quality like this able to scale up easily especially for a small company.

The battery packs are FAA compliant with most airlines (except spirit) because they state they are each battery pack are under the 100 WH limit and can be carried on airlines. They use Lithium ion Samsung 25r, is it 10s3p?

That‚Äôs really nice and clean , I wonder if their BMS system are on the battery pack themselves or just connected to the system the batteries are In. 

I can see them offering a 30Q system In The future for better preformance for a high price. Smart to start with 25r to cut price down potentially.
