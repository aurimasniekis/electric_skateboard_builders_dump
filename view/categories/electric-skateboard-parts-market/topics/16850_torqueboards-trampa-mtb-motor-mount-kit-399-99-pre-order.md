Hey guys,

I've been working on a Trampa Motor Mount Kit and most of the parts are available.

The setup includes (2) 63mm motor mounts, (1) support bar and (3) support brackets.
The drive train uses (2) 72T HTD5 20mm Drive Wheel Pulley and (2) 13T HTD5 20mm Motor Pulleys (also a 12T option).
All aluminum parts are made in 7075 Aluminum.
