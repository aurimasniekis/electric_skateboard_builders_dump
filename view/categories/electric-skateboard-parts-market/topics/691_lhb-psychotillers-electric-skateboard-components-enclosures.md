That's fancy talk for boxes! Keep your batteries and ESCs fresh and cozy in these super tough and super awesome ABS enclosures. Currently I have two flavors of boxes from SoCal's favorite vacuum forming mastermind listed on my site and ready to send you at a moment's notice.

Im rebuilding a board with the Arc 200's on a re-born caldera and a 12s4p 30q pack.  I had to go double stack because the controllers are massive.  So I'm waiting on a deep dish wedge from @psychotiller so I can finish up.   

The Altar Wedge would probably be a good candidate for 'quick removal'.  Its pretty rigid and has insets and outsets to keep its shape and phase wire covers.
