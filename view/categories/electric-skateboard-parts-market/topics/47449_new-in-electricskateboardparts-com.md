I actually bought his books last year:

DIY Lithium Batteries: How to Build Your Own Battery Packs

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XRKD15B/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_0KYKAbYRM02F0

Very promising.

lol ok

"If you need a compatible remote and receiver, we recommend this remote and receiver that are designed to be plug and play with this BMS." 

This was for their dual esc. This is what happens when you don't know anything about the shit your selling

25R 30A continuous discharge? Something could could easily reach...   at 25A discharge those cells go to 110 Celcius. Its like selling a bomb.![samsung-inr18650-25R-discharge|599x467](upload://Aog8dYGt6fUMBvwWuKzXFk7ir4O.png)

the speed controller. almost everyone here buys bms's rated for atleast 20a more than what their pack can discharge. the bms over discharge is a last resort, just like alot of the other features of a bms. its there incase something goes wrong

I don't really see why I would buy anything from here. Of the items I would consider buying, I can get them for a lot cheaper from other sources.
