I'm interested, but my understanding is you can't ship this to the US due to the high output.

Onloop does it somehow, not sure how though, but there is a way.

If you ship a battery directly from the factory, it can go anywhere in the world; that's how Enertion does it. 

Otherwise, I haven't seen anyone ship a space cell overseas after they've bought it.
