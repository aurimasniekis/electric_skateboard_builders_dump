Hello every one, I wanted more hub motors for personal use so I have placed an order for 20x of my 63mm hub motors.
They are based on the 6355 motor that enertion sell and will have the same high quality stator and winding with my magnet upgrades.

https://youtu.be/KoS3JEfzYEI

The motors will also come with a 83mm wheel on the motor. 

The great thing is I will be selling them for $299 for a pair. They have great power and save you a lot on your build while looking so much better.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5ee2d8a0a4fb606287d0e4fe4c221c85607266dd.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Please every one let me know your interest, there are only 8 sets up for grabs as I need to keep 2 for myself. If I need to order more I can do that.

Shipping date 11th of Jan

i haven't converted a motor to a hub motor i have designed and built a motor from ground up. the stator and winding is done at a factory that makes outrunner and that factory has great quality at a higher cost and this is why onloop uses them.

but the KV rating is 80Kv.

benefits you can suspect is smoother riding, low resistance when not using your motors, weight reduction, cost, and aesthetics.

That $300 is for two motors, right? What wheel color options are available and how do i tell you what color i want? I'm sure you can guess what color i want though lol

it does come with the wheels pressed on though, right? I still don't have a lathe or a drill press. 

Very interested in these because of the 83mm wheel package. Carvons are 90 and 97, and i'm very much in love with his product, but crave additional options.

Wheel colour will all be the same, as I can't get all different so I will sent out a servey soon, 

The smaller wheel size means less torque is needed.

$299 for for 2 motors. No shipping is needed until 1 week before delivery, if every thing goes to plan I could offer $30 world wide shipping or ever free shipping.

Since you don't have a shopping cart with a shipping calculator, you should probably try to work the cost of shipping into your price and just call it free shipping. Run a few far out addresses and see what the worst looks like, then go from there. If you end up raising your price $20 or something then so be it. 

I vote either white, black, or red.

Did you get my update email? The color is hard, as material cost is high for the urethane, it costs about $15 per wheel to make and I have to mix up at least 10 wheels in each color and Iv got to make 30 wheels the die costs about $80 per color.
But I will soon after every thing is shipped I'll have more time and money to make some more and offer them at cost.

So after a lot of time testing different urathan formula and adjusting the mould to are displacement.

The wheels are finished,

Also getting the motor winding right is the most important part and because I'm using a better quality stator we had to do a few different tests, but we have exactly 80kv.
All parts are finished just to be sent to me and assembled. See below a photo of the nice black caps and chromed motor can it really looks great.

How long is the stator?

55mm long.
Based on a modified 6355 BLDC motor but redesigned for low kv.
The improved magnet quality, precision milling, and winding separates this from other parts.

I'm looking forward to benchmarking this. I doubt a dual (combined 30amp) is powerful enough for mountain boarding, but I might be pleasantly surprised. These motors should support up to 10s and (in theory) 40amps current.  These have only ever been tested up to 12s with 30Amp combined.

What is the magnet quality?

Like I said, this is based off the 6355. It has a diameter of 63mm and a stator length if 55mm. Additionally the thane sets a final diameter just over 80mm.

N48 (non SH in this group) so around 1.5 Teslas ideally.

Benchmarking as in taking measurements for comparison.  I'm an engineering student and I'm currently working a a solid stator (made of compressed ferrous material). Ideally it'll be more effective than electrical steel.

O ok I thought these fit in a kegel wheel.  The kegel is 56mm wide. 


Making a stator.  Cool. I was into the idea of making a powder core once.  From what I read you can get a better result as you aren't limited by the shaping of laminations and can therefore use the endturns

My university has developed methods for powder iron compress statar's and have a patent on them, but they arnt aloud to work with me on them as they have contracts and non disclosure agreements with clients.

Got it a Google (Adelaide university) it's interesting.

The stator is 5130 so 51mm diameter and 30mm long the same as is in the rspec motor.

My total motor measurements are 56mm wide from cap to cap, the diameter is actually about 68mm because of my thicker magnets and the wheel groves.
My wheels are 56mm wide 83-85mm diameter (because of urethane shrinkage)

At the moment there is a lot of work going on with hub motor and it's great.
There is myself
Carvon
Hummina
NVG
And companies like mellow and inboard but I like the community supported motors better like carvon and hummina and NVG because it incurages improvements.

It's a tough challenge and I wonder how long any of these hub motors will last.  I feel like they are all underbuilt.  having an aluminum shaft to start is not ideal.  Since there are such extreme forces the bearing must have no movement in the housing and on the shaft.  Ideally the bearings then should be press fitted.  In my searching manufacturers won't give interference fit numbers (press or shrink fit) for the thin bearings that are typically used in these smaller motors. While they  do recommend an interference fit due to the extreme loads they can't give a number (such as one thousandths of an inch interference or overlap) and say experiments must be done as the expansion of the shaft could possibly snap the race on such thin bearings. So a tight slide fit with retaining fluid is safer and seems to hold well anyway. 

 the thermal expansion especially of the aluminum shaft which expands double steels expansion rate and you don't have to get near the bearing max temp of 250f before both bearing seats expand and put a lot of pressure on the bearing races.  They will start to squeeze creating greater friction within the bearing shortening its life and at worst even binding it.  Bearings need to have both a radial and axial clearance inside the bearing for the thermally expanding motor and the ensuing squeeze. A "c3" or even "c4" bearing is intended for just such a high heat situation and has the bit more radial and axial play in the bearing that's needed to allow the balls room when the squeeze happens.
The airgap needs to be a fraction bigger with these but I forget the numbers and it's minute. 
The electrical aspect of the motor is easy really and you just tell the manufacturer what magnets and winding and kv you want.  It's all available and getting the torque needed isn't a problem. But if the motor starts to rub...the plating on the magnets is something like a thousand of an inch and it goes quickly..then the fragile interior of the magnets deteriorates..and then if your lucky they don't turn to tiny chunks of head over heals stuff.
Sealed bearing are also more appropriate than shielded for the rough environment

i get all of my parts machined to 0.01+/- or 0.001 for high parts that need high tolerance like the motor can where the magnets are glued, as i get an air gap of 0.5mm constant and this is why i use arc magnets not flat because there is less inconsistency in the airbag.

magnets are made in a mould and have a tolerance of 0.1mm so my high tolerance on this part helps with this.
the problem is you can't just ask your motor factory to make what you want they all will ask for samples, i have source my own magnet factory because the magnets that most of these factories use are cheap and i pay for the premium $0.20 compared to the $1 i pay per magnet.

my bearings are not cheap and are made for so much more rpm and torque then these motors are producing.
u have the magnets press fit to the shaft but not to the caps but they still ant easy to get out.

the shaft is alloy, but please remember that there is also a steel shaft inside of the alloy shaft, the same shaft that is used for all longboard with racers going down hill at 80-100km/h and the slid braking where down hill force is grater then my motors that you can have a stronger shaft them what they use because it is reinforced by the alloy shaft.

i have been making hub motors for over 2 years and made a lot of these mistakes that you have made clear, but have learned from them.

but your welcome to participate and please share your own opinions and any ways we can improve i will get my exact bearing product code but it is a HCH 17x30x7mm bearing, i would rather use a 17x40x7mm bearing.

What is premium about your magnets? I find you can get good magnets with .1mm tolerances standard on the web in all kinds of temperature abilities, strength, and platings

Bearings are rated for rpm and for static and dynamic load. The torque from your motor is not related to what the bearing will experience  

 the danger to the aluminum shaft is it will be deformed if the loads go through a bearing that isn't permanently fixed on an aluminum seat regardless of what's under it.

Checking out Stary's recent update. We should definitely look into the planetary gear setup.

Jacob - Have you tested your motors on 20% grade hills.

As of now, I don't think they can keep up w/ the belt driven as far as hill climbing goes.. It would be a great to get rid of the belt drive in the near future completely even for hill climbers.

I still need to setup Carvon's (Jerry's) setup and test it up in the hills around here but I'm afraid of having it fail and me walking it up LOL.

I didn't say my magnets are premium I said that they are better quality then what Saite or Emp (Emotor as they are called know)
Because you could buy 50 magnets from 50 different companies and have them tested and there will be some that just arnt as advertised like batterys.

My thicker wider and arc magnets are what makes the improvements, I had my motors wound to a standard 80kv in Wye noarmaly 12turn but with the magnet improvements the kv was reduced to 60kv thus allowing me to decrease the turns to 10turn and increase the amount of copper strands meaning the motors can handle higher current.

Planetary gear would be amazing torqueboard but I really don't have time any more to even look into it.
I personally don't have any hills that are over a 15% grade that I have found around me that are safe or have any sort of run up to test them on, but Iv never had a problem on a 15% in my test video I did a 10% and it didn't even slowdown. But I still don't think they can do a 20% very well. Hub motors are for cruising I think.
If I can get my motors to perform like my boosted board then that would be amazing.

Ok so I am sorry for a bit of silence, 

Thanks to Benjamin Vedder we discovered some thing wasn't right with the motor winding, after a long weekend I worked out what it was, the B phase group was wound backwards. Very easy fix just have to do some modding.

Know I have fixed a few for sampling and man these things have torque. Will post a video over the week end. Complete it weights 7kg with carbon deck and space cell that's only 200g more then boosted but with bigger motors and 5ah more battery.

As for the winding I'm leaning to sending them back and the factory fixing them or I can go it my self but the quality might be higher them just rewinding them.

initial inspection looks promising.
If I was being super critical, because I'm an Anal OCD pedantic mofo..
the thane appears to have bubbles in it and there is a scratch across the face of one of the hubs.. 
however this is purely cosmetic and other than that the build quality look top notch!
im very excited to get thes on... 

what loctite should I use? and where?

yes the thane has bubbles this is from air displacer and it is so hard to get right, the mould has to be taller then the wheel needs to be and then the excess machined off, this is why your wheels have rings on the inside edge.
next batch i will have this fixed and will send every one a new set of wheels.

the scratch is from the factory after i sent then back for the motors to be rewound they did not pay due care and i am sorry but i could not rectify this with out adding more time onto the order.

i have used red lock tight, you can place a little amount on the grub screw and just a little on the nut, it is just to stop vibration rotation nothing els

ok here is a trap for young players:
I have just screwed the sleeve nut (thats what I'm calling it from now on) lightly onto my truck to check for fit. And I am talking LIGHTLY! not even finger tight, just loosely with my thumb and fore finger and it would appear that I have already damaged the thread inside the sleeve nut, from what I can only assume is a burr on my axle thread.

unless of course it was already damaged? I was so excited I didn't check.
it the other one is not damaged at all, dare I try it on the same axle?

I might need to run a dye over my axles before I try any more funny business.

OK I went and did it anyway. I screwed the other sleeve nut onto the same axle the same amount of turns that I did with the first one and it is not damaged at all.
I fear that one of my sleeve nuts may have been damaged prior to shipping :(

lucky your in aus ill send you another one, could also have been that that bur is know inside of the nut.

they problem is the nut goes lot further onto the axel then a normal longboard nut will,so a good clean could be in order, if you get the damaged one how bad is the thread? could it be redeemed at all for now by with a 6mm hex key tightening it onto the axel, or by using a tap and die set.

but ultimately i can have this part made cheap and from know on ill get a crap load of spares made.

i have a tap and die set, I could probably clean it up. but I'm a little bit edgy on using a damaged thread seeing as it is holding the motor on!
I just freaked out a little bit when I looked inside and saw all that damage on the thread (I'm a car enthusiast as well so I know my way around a nut and bolt) I have put the undamaged one on and off the axle about 3 times now and there is no evidence of any damage. did i mention i was using thumb and forefinger? like so lightly i don't even think it would have been possible for me to cause the damage. I'll put up some photos and video later.

I dont know if you can really see it but the one on the right is damaged. The one on the left I screwed on and off the same axle 3 times and there is not a mark on it. So im pretty certain that i didn't damage that thread with my fingers.

I don't have a 12s battery so I can't test this but they work fine on 10s, 12s won't improve on efficiency much unless reducing the kv more to get a higher voltage at your desired speed.

The motor are 70kv +/- 5kv  so your top speed will be 50km/h on 12s but the motor will only be spinning 3,100rpm or 43,400erpm

These are my recommended setting for the hub motors.

The braking is not to strong but very sudden if you use the default motor setting and this is not what we won't for motorised longboard.
The settings I have set are very smooth and progressive braking and I feel you could increase the setting to tailor your own riding style, but at this point do not increase max current over 40a and I have not fully tested it.

As for BLDC settings:
The BEMF coupling is working best at 300
The integrator limit 150
Min ERPM 50
Int limit min ERPM 600
Start up boost 0.09

When doing motor detections these where the readings I got but then all of a sudden I started getting a BEMF reading of 2000 this could be vesc related but if your motors don't work with your own motor detection or if you feel it looks a little high the set it at 300.

Benjamin Vedder suggested setting low duty to 0.9 for motor detection for these motors and this might fix the problem.

The rest is just setting for the space cell.

This is data from only 1 vesc out of 2!

Ok guys first i have to apologise for the sound i forgot to get the sound to record form my web can that i was holding instead of my macbook mic that had road vibration and the carbon fibre lid the wasn't fully shut to let the usb cable out.

So the first hill was a 10deg hill that i have gone up in a few of my videos,
the second was the 28deg hill i went up in my last video, this time i made it 90% of the way before the battery amp cut off went on my second vesc you can see that the first got to 22a and the limit was 25a per vesc.

as you can see the video feed cut at the last second because my board started rolling back down the hill and my web cam usb was in my hand.

I have set up the settings as you have described, but when I ran motor detection it came up with slightly different parameters is this ok?

also my first test spin sees them cogging a bit at low speed, but I haven't finished my 12S yet so I was testing with a 6S I assume this probably has something to do with it and it will probably not be an issue on 12S.

Can you screen shot them for me, you have about 3 strands of copper more per phase then me so being a little out is fine, 

More cogging at start up is to be expected with hub motors because they have a lower rolling resistance then a belt drive, so it takes the vesc a little longer to get to the biting point, but jump into the advanced settings at set the start up boost to 0.06-0.09 is what I have been playing with.

Very impressed with the overall quality! I have yet to mount the motors to trucks just some bench testing. Im hoping I can finish my deck soon to try these bad ass mother f@#%ers out. Should be done by april. As you can see I'll be using 2 VESC and a space cell. 

Only issue so far is I seam to be missing the large axle screw on one of the motors. Im not sure if I misplaced it or if it never shipped. Either way I will need a new one so @jacobbloy just let me know the cost and I will paypall the amount.

I just received my 83mm flywheel clones, and they are a pretty close match for diameter.
however I neglected to realize that I will need to put 150mm hangers on the hub motors to even out the offset.

I have to say guys get on this! these motors are a beautiful piece of work and certainly at this time the best hub motors I have seen or ridden.
I try to make it my business to compare everything and be super critical so that you guys don't have to guess.
 these things are awesome. and with the exception of maybe a slightly bigger grub screw on the internal collar there is not much you could do to improve.
as has been pointed out the shuddering that I experienced in my video was due to the VESC setting not these motors.

you can also see even a single one of these hub motors run off cheap hobbyking parts still has the torque to pull me along to a reasonable speed, so that's pretty impressive

It would be a massive shame for the esk8 builders community if these motors ceased to exist due to lack of backing. @jacobbloy has put the work in, but without community support they might just slip through the cracks.

in short BUY THESE MOTORS!

Have you received Hummie's motors yet? This seems like one hell of a deal, and I'm probably gonna get on one of the lists for the next round of hub motors, but I'd love to first see how these compare to each other. 

And thanks for all your scientific contributions and testing!! :grinning:

maybe this will help any one deciding!

Also the issues mentioned in this thread have been fixed by increasing the set screw size, and adding 2 alignment pin holes that will mate with the trucks with this kit!
But can easily be added to any truck with the supplied drill jig.

Mail Services dug through everything and did not find any unclaimed DHLs.
Could you send me the DHL tracking number?
