A little off topic, but is there a guide somewhere on how to build that charger? I remember looking through the thread but there wasn’t a set of instructions or a full set of links (that I can remember). 

Good luck with the sale :grinning:

Legit question: why mounting the motors just below the kicktail? Isn't that making it un-usable ? :thinking:

I can perfectly kick turn with it. Now if i placed them facing forward there would be very little room for dual VESC6 and 12S battery. The motor mounts are adjustable so you can get them closer to the deck
