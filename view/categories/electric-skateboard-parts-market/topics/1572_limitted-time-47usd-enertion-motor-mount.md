This is a pretty good steal while it lasts for anyone interested:

I believe they were close to $75...

While the sale lasts, I think they are the cheapest mount- the only other really good (and lower priced) mount I can think of is @psychotiller's, which is $60.

That said, the prices might come out to be more equal once you factor in Enertion's paid overseas shipping vs, @psychotiller's $5 shipping...

Still worth the consideration IMO

Thanks @cmatson! I appreciate the chatter! This week I will have the original 60mm, 60mm with optional idler, and the 66mm mount with optional idler. Price with idler's will be $75
