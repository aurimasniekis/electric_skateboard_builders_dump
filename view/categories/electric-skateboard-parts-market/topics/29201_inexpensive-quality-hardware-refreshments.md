Just wanted to let you guys know i'm in the process of ordering a bunch of skate hardware for use in my own board builds and warranty work. I'm ordering it all in bulk though, so i thought i would give back to the community a little and sell it for very low markup on my site. 

I'm getting quite a bit of the following:

black axle nuts with clear nylock inserts
black kingpin nuts with clear nylock inserts
black kingpins, 68mm (or very close), generic but caliber compatible, not splined i believe. 
black bushing washers, flat for barrels
black bushing washers, cup for cones

I already received a couple pounds of black 1.75" truck bolts and nuts with clear nylock.

Basically the reasons i'm doing this are i'm sick of running out of this dumb shit and having to run to the store only to find that they only have chrome hardware or are out of this one thing and then looking online to find a $7 bag of two kingpin nuts. 

You can thank @nate for this mostly because every time he sends his board in for tweaks i have to replace almost all of his hardware, especially the kingpin nuts. He cranks them down so hard they strip. I can never find them when i need them so i have about three sets of trucks now without nuts and missing bushing washer cups. Then i think he leaves his board out in the rain for dogs to pee on because its always rusty. 

Also i like to provide hardware refreshments on warranty work anyway, If i see rust it gets replaced. 

So i thought since i was going to have all of this shit on hand for my own use, i would provide it at a very low markup and give you guys a little break.

How about $10 for fresh kingpins, washers, and nuts in black for two trucks in a bag?

I may also do bigger bags of refreshments, like maybe enough for two boards so you'll have spares. 

I can also do $4 bags of 8 1.75" truck bolts since they are sort of hard to find sometimes and usually cost more than that. 

Let me know what y'all think.

You know.. i may consider that because i literally just ordered almost 60 meters of 180mm black pvc heat shrink which is what's used on space cells and other single layer 18650 packs with that layout. 

So yes, why the heck not. 50cm should cover just about any reasonable length battery and give you a little extra to slip on if you over do it with the heat gun and need to cover the hole you just made. 

Not sure what that would cost but it would be really cheap. Probably like 4 bucks or something. 

BTW shipping on all this shit will be like 1 or 2 bucks, not expensive. Small items, small envelopes, low weight = very low shipping, even for USPS 3 day priority.

Spacers, 8 for $4
https://longhairedboy.com/collections/all/products/little-bag-of-spacers

I've got kingpins, kingpin nuts, axle nuts, cups, and washers coming and the prices will be similarly low. 

I'm tired of being raped on hardware markup and i thought maybe you guys might be too. 

all of the hardware will be black to go with any style.

It looks like the rest of the hardware will be showing up Monday. 

That's axle nuts, kingpins, kingpin nuts, flat and cup washers. 

I'll have everything bagged and listed probably the following day. Prices will be low compared to typical amazon and skate shop BS.

Good idea!  How are the flat washers? Do they cover the full width of a 1.5" barrel bushing without slop around the kingpin? 

Grade 8 kingpins?

Side note, I recommend your customer Nate tries harder bushings. If you're cranking them down that tight, you're doing it wrong

i just got a load of 180mm black pvc  in and i'm about to  take pics and list it within a day or so. Also got some red 85mm for single cell rows. The 180 will slip over the old space cells, so that's two 18650s with spacers. it will also slip over a double layer of stacked cells with no spacers, that's what i use on my packs.

also i now have 180mm heat shrink for those battery packs everyone is building. 3ft length for $6.50. That's enough to fix two space cells or wrap two 12S5Ps when stacked the way i do them, and you don't have to wait for an e-packet from china.

Def interested in the enclosure mounting hardware. How the hell do I mount the gold nuts? They don't look threaded.

Also I am interested in getting some of the wrap if it would fit around my lipos.
