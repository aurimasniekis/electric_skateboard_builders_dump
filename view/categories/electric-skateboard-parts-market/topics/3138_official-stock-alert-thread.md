Lol no....

It would be a waste ....

If you are doing light duty ... Use a 50mm motor....

But do yourself a favor and just stick with 63mm motors

For a 6s I suggest a kv higher than 200 but below 270kv 

And please use this link to do your calculation:

I've already bought the 149 kv motor thinking lower kv was always better. So looks like i'm gonna go with 12s. Also as far as the esc being able to handle the load, I purchased a VESC from ollin, so I'm thinking I should be good :)

That's cool...then things are good...just have to make space for the extra battery and do the wiring ... That's all that's diffrent from the 6s set up.

Might want to think of an anti-spark solution ðŸ¤”

I know I will.

Just need to worry abt the gearing....I set it at 16/36 because @torqueboards has a 16t and the wheel pulleys I have are 36t...

I did. Then i took what they tooled around with and tooled it some more. Chopped it down to a 10mm belt surface and ground down the hub onsert teeth to fit clones. Now that i know exactly what i'm doing with them it takes about 20 minutes. A 33 tooth wheel pulley is actually kind of sweet, especially on a 12S with a 190kv.

live feed from the garage? or episodic edited vlogging like @onloop does? 

I don't know if you guys want to watch my garage man... i mean i employ some pretty dark sorcery in there to get things working. For example, last night i sacrificed a small child i found in walmart to Dark Lord Skatan so that i could get a few more watt hours out of this 10S i'm building. That's basically all found kids in walmart are worth, so next time i'm hitting up Target instead.  Upside is its a little faster now with higher throughput, downside is that every year the customer will have to feed it raw meat from a freshly killed virgin, which wasn't included in the price.

renamed to the official stock alert thread, like i said before i will keep on the look out for parts that are out of stock and in high demand to come back in stock. if there is something you want drop a line and i will add it to the list.

right now its all 63mm sk3's
63mm tacon bigfoot 245KV motors
and 90mm flywheel clones.

if there is something else you want add it to the list.

## \#64 Posted by: delta_19 Posted at: 2016-06-11T07:46:16.180Z Reads: 220

a motors name is its size so a 6364 means it is 63mm in diameter and 64mm long.
so the 6364 and 6374 are longer then the 6355

next as a motor of the same diameter gets longer it has more torque 
so the 6374 has the best torque, 6364 second, and 6355 comes in last.

not touching on quality because there is no videos or written reports on which is better and i dont want to start a cluster fuck.

so from there i would just say go for what you want either will last you the same amount of time give or take a month.

[quote="delta_19, post:64, topic:3138"]
next as a motor of the same diameter gets longer it has more torque
[/quote]

this is not entirely accurate, it is possible to increase the length of the motor barrel and keep the stator size (and magnets) the same length. This is a common "trick" that some resellers do.

To increase the torque output from a motor you need to increase the stator and/or the magnets and/or the copper mass.

The HobbyKing US East warehouse has the [Turingy G160 245kv](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idproduct=71682) in stock. I'm only seeing 3 units though, so go fast if you're interested. If you go through [RC Search](http://rcsearch.info/hobbyking/i71682/#catalog) you can get a bit of a discount (about $4)

I would be careful about ordering these motors...I tried to order them, but they sent me 240KV motors instead.  And then I returned them and then sent me 240KV motors again...And then I returned them again and asked them to send me the 190KV and they said they would rather give me a full refund since they aren't sure they could send me the right motors.

So either these motors don't exist, or they are so insanely terribly organized that they can't send the right motors...So just be prepared to get 240KV if you order these.

How does the quality feel ?

And are they small enough for a dual build ?

Quality seemed fine.  They felt pretty solid in my hands.  But as I said I returned them so I didn't try them out. I ended up buying "stealth" motors from the group buy that's going on right now.  They are 6364 so I don't think you can fit a dual rear.  If I'm not mistaken most people are running 6355 or smaller for dual rear setups.  

I didn't consider using them as I thought it would be simple for them to just send me the right motors.  I was surprised when I got the refund as I guess the just gave up on trying to get me the right motors...So yeah.  It was a strange saga.

If you do get the right motors, let me know.  Still would be interested in trying them out.  It could be a good option at that price point.

I am reluctant to believe that at 25C 8ah Battery can deliver 200a

25 x 8 = 200 does not give a true spec when it comes to Lipos and thier discharge capability.

They might be good or they might not. 

Thereâ€™s an old saying. 
If it sounds too good to be true then it probably is.
It would be more believable if they where 150C cells instead of 25C
