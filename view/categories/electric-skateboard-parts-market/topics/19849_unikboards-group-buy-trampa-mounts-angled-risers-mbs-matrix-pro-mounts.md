Hey,

if any interest I can organize a group buy as we did for the smart series for those who are looking to a similar build and/or looking for mountainboard mounts (either Trampa or MBS Matrix Pro). 

This time I'm looking to produce in precision milled AL7075 black anodizing:
- 35° angled risers for Trampa Vertigo trucks
- Dual motor mount for Trampa Vertigo trucks
- 60T wheel mount pulleys 15mm
- Dual motor mount for Matrix MBS PRO trucks

Let me know who's interested; idea would be to get around 20pcs (which is like 10 dual mounts) so we can get a good price.

Cool count me in. @unik

Are you actually doing any jumps in this setup or mostly just for riding?

I could do jumps, the only challenge is the weight... here I went for 12S6P which is overkill. This also adds to the 3D printed box with integrated plastic inserts/hubs that I have stratified with carbon ! 

I was able to jump on my trampa so here that's also achievable. The feeling of riding short board brings a lot of adrenaline to the game!

I will measure that for you; wheels are 200m; but I managed to get the angled riser to the lowest level possible to match a 35° angle. Yeah 12S6P is overkill but it's still manageable.

Hey, it seems the some people are having challenges replying to this thread; just don't know why. Good thing is that they can still read and access the XLS file to add themselves to the journey !

As promised, here are a few shots of the parts. This is the 3D view as the only prototypes I have for the 35° riser and Trampa mounts are on my board (I still can take real photos of them if you want).

This setup looks super sweet! How else does it feel like when riding? .. not accounting it might be very ''snappy'' and turny I suspect..

Other than that.. looks like a real ''mini tank'' under your feet! :D @unik  **Have you considered using smaller size pneumatics for such board size?** 

---
It looks like the wheels + angled riser brings up the board quite high off the ground.. + **do you really feel the need for the big wheels in city environment?**

 .. as it does not look like your 1st choice / interest might be to ride this board in the park / unpaved pathes of some forest road.. more like mixed terrain, maybe on roads with some gravel, loose rock roads.. shitty pavement..

--

Personally, my 'dream' would be to build such ''hybrid'' board, using wheels something like these:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/4/b474bb20b6cec0b28b7d76798c1d4755b9f259c8.jpg" width="360" height="360">

Just not 100% sure how it would look :slight_smile:

hey everyone, sorry for the standby on this. In fact I was improving the actual parts (I can't stop continuous improvements)

I am actually consolidating the quotes to make it more clear for everyone. Before this, I need to run a batch of prototypes (i.e two pcs of each) to ensure that everything is perfect before moving to 20pcs.

I will be also releasing two kinds of 66T wheel drivers on 17mm (I added 2mm to ensure enough coverage)
- a CORE one with a 28mm bearing for Trampa trucks for Trampa hubs/wheels (because the trampa truck axle is widder)
- a SMART one that fits either Trampa trucks or Matrix MBS 2 trucks with Trampa hub/wheels.

This is the CORE version as a sneak peek.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/8/384b8c21f58fc3458a48489384e73900e80b94ce.png" width="672" height="436">

You will also see on the updated parts that I went to something more luxury, smooth edges, bevels and so on; but to be honest, I'm doing that for pleasure. It may be cheaper to get simple raw parts but I prefer to go the "luxury" way, especially because these parts will last for a while :)

I now need to find the funds to make the last prototypes which are hella expensive but that's the price to pay to avoid any overcommitment and a sexy delivery on time.

Stay tuned, in the next days I will be sharing with you the prices for the parts. In parallel, I will find some funding to move forward.

hey - a quick update - happy easter folks. Great to see a lot of interest ! I'm gonna launch the final prototypes today. So I expect to have them in maximum 10 days. One I got the final parts, I will take photos and make a group buy as we did for the SMART SERIES, in quality, time, cost. Just simple, I could do a group buy now with the prototypes but if there's one thing I hate in the DIY scene is people that overcommit and then give unbalanced promises ... and it's starting to be the normality to give money to companies (even hobbyist ones) and have the end user wait forever ever and always for good reasons. I always say what I have to say, and not what most of the people want to hear; which make a big difference. Of course, the first option would be easier for me, as I would be using the customer funds to make my business; but I will never go this route.

@Jebe : The Trampa motors mounts are for Trampa spring trucks (Infinity, Vertigo, Ultimate). The pulleys will work for for Trampa superstar hubs (this also apply to the CORE pulley). The MBS mounts are for Matrix MBS II trucks (covers MBS 2 PRO trucks too as this is the same hanger)

The 35° risers are different for Matrix and Trampa Trucks (baseplate is different), so I'm going to pay > 300 euros just to validate that the MBS riser is perfect before going to "mass production".

In any case, with the stuff; everyone will be able to choose to go the Mountainboard way on a Trampa or MBS deck... or use risers to put Mountainboard trucks on his longboard. Lots of options and portability here and there.

a quick update - I've just launched the prototypes production. It's basically a set of each part. I should have everything within 10 days. Once I got the parts, I will publish the same day the photos, and launch a group buy on each part on cost, time and quality. Basically anyone will be able to order anything. I will then launch the production and you'll get your parts shipped from Paris with love ! Sounds like a plan !

Tuesday's update - My planning was actually OK. The parts are really good in terms of quality. I'm now going to assemble this to Trampa / Matrix trucks and will post photos tomorrow with the prices. I'm still negotiating to get the best price. 

Once the prices are published, you can take your time to see what you need and then join the orders that will be opened  by saturday evening. Why ? because as always, I will then ride with them to ensure they are perfect. I know I could do that right now, but I really want to ensure I'm not selling promises but real / tested stuff.

I'm pretty sure everything will go as planned, maybe I'm taking too much precautions but well, that's my motto !

Please all post in this thread (avoid PM - seems some people cannot post here for some reasons so PM is OK for them) as this will start to get too complicated ! Let's use this thread for transparency and sharing!

a quick and dirty one to show you how this goes. I'm not going to surprise anyone but Trampa has been and is really top notch quality. If I compare a Trampa Infinity to the MBS truck close to it... there will be no competition. Trampa quality feels so much superior.

sunday's update. Few modifications have been made to the website with some additional description to keep it lean and products almost integrated with target prices if we reach the objectives. More flexibility has been added for people that want free choice and not stick to one single bundle. I'm just missing the 35° riser photo for the Trampa trucks (which is actually on my board), so I may ended up by putting some live photos on it installed on the deck.

if we don't make the objective, we will give back the money as this is nothing hugely commercial but more a group initiative. So please use PayPal to ensure that this is done correctly.

Nah im good but thanks for showing the 'concept'. Battery does look pretty good.. I estimate a range of about 10km is possible with it and off-road (AT) tires?

So after 10km, you can just swap in the next one.. is the replacement procedure easy to do?

hey guys, I'm just back from holidays in the desert but my mate kept track of the delivery. I will be getting the parts tomorrow (confirmed by the tracking number) and they will be sent to you all with tracking same day. I will of course post photos. I had a little delay on the parts because I've added one additional hole to allow the mount to be installed on reverse trampa infinity hangers. It's an option that people can take, so I decided to included it and change the design so people can get a better product without having a huge impact on the delivery dates.

keep you posted tomorrow!
