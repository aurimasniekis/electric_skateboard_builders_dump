## **LHB TOTALLY BITCHIN' 190KVS 6355**

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/a/fae7794e7b162c944f40ff9207a274fd80f324f7.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Comes with everything seen here. Ask your parent's permission before purchasing. 

I'm setting aside 10 of these guys for immediate sale to forum members. The other 10 are alotted for customer builds and long term wear and abuse testing on my own boards. 

I'm selling these so I can buy 20 more and try to keep the goodness flowing. So far testing has yielded very positive results. If everything goes well I'll add these to my site and attempt to keep some kind of stock. 

SPECS:
Format: 6355 brushless outrunner
peak power output: 3520 watts (allegedly, we'll find out the truth eventually i suppose)
voltage: 2S - 12S. They handle 12S perfectly with no issues. 
KV: 190
Sensors: YES. 3 hall sensors
keyway: YES. accepts keys up to 18mm. 
Red anodize: 20% performance boost over any other color

INCLUDES: 
motor, snap rings, VESC sensor adapter, and 16mm pulley key. 

These are basically drop in replacements for R-SPECs so if you're interested in upgrading your Gen 1 Raptor to sensored motors, this would be the way to do it. The total motor housing length seems to be about 2mm longer, but that can be adjusted for with the addition of a couple of speed rings and a slight repositioning of the motor mounts. That's all it took to swap them out on my shop's test boards. 

Everything included here: **$130 with free shipping**

send the money, your name, and your street address to paypal at https://www.paypal.me/longhairedboy/130 

and i will box that shit up and mail it like moms is on fire

Hello. I also posted something on your thread about getting a smooth start from a stand still but that may have been a bit premature. I am wondering where I can by this adapter. Sorry for taking this thread about off topic.

That's exactly why i had to go back and hit them up for their adapters. When i got my motors in i realized the same thing, then i saw that they were bundling adapters with thier own VESCs because they ent me a free one to try out, so i got them to send me some. 

I'll bet if you hit them up they'll send you a few. I may even go back for more now that i see there's a need for them.

The adapter is to change the sensor cable family, on normal RC cars the sensor cables are JST ZH (1.5mm pitch), the vesc has a JST PH (2mm pitch). This adapter is just a cable, JST-SH to JST-PH.

it won't make your motor sensored.

Im not sure I know what you mean here, I have a sensored motor I just need the adaptor to fit it to the VESC.

Do you think they would do this for free or would there be a charge with this? Seems to me I would have to buy something else.

you would have to pay for them of course, and they will try to upsell you by telling you some crap about shipping from china, but if you press them they'll sell them to you. 

You could also make your own using the parts @blasto mentioned.

Do you know how I would go about paying for them since it isn't on their website for sale? Sorry if this is a stupid question but I have never bought from them before.

They like to send invoices by email and take paypal as payment. You're going to have to have a conversation with them. Say hi to Jollin and Eileen for me :slight_smile:

Awesome, I might just do that to save myself the hassle. I am a bit confused though as I have not seen the "pre-crimped" wire before. Does it plug into the JST-PH slots? So in That case I would order 6 of them? Sorry again for any stupid questions.

Yep they just clip-in the PH housing. They are wonderful, I hate fussing with crimps.

The wires are singles, you would need 6 per connector. I ordered a fuckton, never know when you need a ph connector.

also come in the [convenient 6" length ideal CAN bus model](http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/jst-sales-america-inc/ASPHSPH24K152/455-3082-ND/6009458)

@Smorto Suppose too.. works for ours depends on what sensor wires Jlabs has on his.. if it's standard then, yes.

This is what they say "180mm Hall Sesnor Wires (120 degree)" . It looks almost identical to the LHB motors except white so I am confident it should work.
