After my DIY boosted board build in August, it is time for a new build. So I am thinking of selling my board because 6boards is to much at home.  **Make a good offer & maybe it is yours.** 
**Price for build with almost new sk3 motor: 800euro’s**

Specs:
Deck: Loaded Vanguard - Flex 2
Trucks: Caliber II 50degrees
Wheels: 90mm ABEC Clones or 97mm ABEC Clones or 107mm ABEC 11(you can chose)
Enclosures: Eboosted enclosure
Battery: 10s3p Li-ion 30Q with 60A high discharge bestechpower BMS
VESC: Focbox
Motors: 1x 6355 190kv alienpower
Motor Mounts: Hobbyking
Remote: Nano-x or Maytech remote 
Bluetooth: HM-10

Board is charged 15 times. Motor have some damaged. If you want I can hold the motor and motor mount, so you can connect a new one. Or I can connect a almost new sk3 motor. 

All wires are routed in the deck. There are also light wires inside the deck. I have now a 42-12v converter inside the board for the lights. 


Because pictures says more then 1000words:

Put up an asking price and leave it there and see how it goes.

If your showing your thought process to us all on how you chose the price we might say well hey this is not worth that much and then your thread could get derailed.

That's a good price.

Is the motor pulley aluminium or steel?

I would be interested in that 10s3p battery with the enclosure if you ever decide to sell separate, shipping may be expensive though, I am in the US.
