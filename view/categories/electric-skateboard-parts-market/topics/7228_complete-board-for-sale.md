Ok so i recently finished my 1st build and this thing is insane i like it so much that my head wont stop spinning thinking about my 2nd build only problem is i financials, so even tho i have to let this one go before i can start on my 2nd one meaning ill probably be esk8less for at least a month till i wait for parts and build it i think i can do it,
Here are the specs 
*Method deck suraido
*4 x 3s 30C 8000mAh lipos  (zippy flightmax)
*Turnigy SK3 6374 149kv
*Ollin vesc w/heat sink
*on/off anti-spark led switch
*torqueboards trucks/83mm wheels/pulleys
*12mm 16T/36T
*torqueboards V4 motor mount
*upgraded bushings
*upgraded bearings (reds super)
*GT2B + mastercho upgrade enclosure
*pshycotiller enclosure

Im riding this board daily, fun, fast and most importantly reliable since day one, a lot of people might think 8awg is an overkill for the wiring but for the difference in price i thought it wont hurt going 8awg and doble anti spark protection
