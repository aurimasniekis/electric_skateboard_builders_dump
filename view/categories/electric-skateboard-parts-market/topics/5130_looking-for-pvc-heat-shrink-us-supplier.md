So I'm looking to purchase some PVC heat shrink for two 12s1p 26650 LiFePO4 packs that I'm building but would prefer not to wait for internal shipping via ebay. Does anyone recommend a US supplier? Or if you have any extra PVC heat shrink that's roughly 4.5-5" in width I'm happy to purchase it + shipping and handling.

I like to see more lifep04 betteries around here. The peace of mind with this batteries is ahead of this time. 

I can charge my packs without monitoring it. And keep the pack always fully charge without having to think about it. 

I've converted to the church of lifep04ism. :blush: we need to come up with a better cult name.
