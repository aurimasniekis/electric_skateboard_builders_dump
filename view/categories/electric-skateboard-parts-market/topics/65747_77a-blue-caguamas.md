Probably. It was a response from their youtube channel when asked if they would make bigger wheels than caguamas. 

Running 97 reflys right now and the torque loss is killing me

FWIW I just placed an order for a set of Caguamas directly from the Orangatang website, they are not listed but if you place the order you will have the option to choose blue :slight_smile:
