Seems like a decent price.... But i just bought a 6m of 8mm x 0.15mm - I heard Sunkko 709A cant do 0.2mm - is it true? Then some other guy showed a chart that it does on higher settings.

This is an excellent price for pure nickel about what you'd pay on Alibaba.com but without having to buy a whole kg and without the wait customs and foreign shipping cost + David is a gold plated member, not gone? Should be soon
