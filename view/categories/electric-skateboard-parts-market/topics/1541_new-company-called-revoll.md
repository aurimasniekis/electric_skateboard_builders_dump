There's a slight curve on top of the deck, not sure it will affect the balancing or curve. But the design is great.

It's also good to know the motor and electronics temperature so that we can constantly monitor to prevent overheat them.

I really like the look of the board, its nice.

however.
it just appears to be a nice looking board and that's it.
generic outrunners
re housed trigger control
no new breakthrough technology
no kicktail
no perpetual steez

just a pretty board.

Thats $4550 Aus. Assume ex postage as well. Is this thing priced for the market, because it doesnt seem that way. How is anyone meant to afford this board.

@Dedbny @mostwanted  Yeah. Pretty steep price even for the Trump. lol. Maybe if somebody could make a homemade poop potato like in the Martian in his/her own backyard, and doesn't use any of their salary to buy the board. Yeah, It's possible.

The price is unrealistic and the specs are unproven. Whos actually going to be able to do an unboxing and review of one of these in May.

Seems i'm not the only one using an exotic camber/w-cave profile on esk8 decks anymore. Or even hard ass stealth bomber inspired angles and edges. Here's one of mine for comparison:

Is it time for me to start tacking "WORLD'S FIRST" all over my deck descriptions now? lol

I have to say, their site, visuals and prototype look pretty slick. I'd love to see a real-life review though.

I like the look of the board, but I don't get the wave shape cross section of the deck, what's up with that ? That can't be comfortable or ergonomic ?
The controller looks downright quirky to me.

i have no idea why they went with a tight w-cave, but i went with a subtle one because it actually cradles your arches in turns at higher speeds. I suspect they went with the profile they did after looking at a few downhill / sliding designs and realizing that you can get a few more millimeters of space to run wires as well as reduce flex.

I dont think its fake,  but good luck to them at that price point. Its certainly high end.  The price is ex shipping and customs for those countries with all the red tape.  Hope their customer service is up to par as well as id be expecting A1 service.  Come on May.
