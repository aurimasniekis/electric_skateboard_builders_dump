Up for sale are 2x v4.12 VESC's made by DIY Electric Skateboard/Torqueboards. These are currently loaded with v2.18 firmware, but originally came with v2.16. I had bought these off another member a while ago, but never ended up using them, and have since accumulated too many extra parts, so something has to go. AFAIK, they have never been mounted or used in an Esk8, only setup on the bench, so they are basically in near new condition with most ports still sealed under shrink wrap. I just tested both of them in the BLDC tool, ran motor detection, spun them up lightly, and they function perfectly. 

Asking for $80/each shipped with the US.
Or $150/both shipped within the US. 
PayPal Goods and Services (or F&F, if you insist)
Located in North SF Bay Area, California.
Ready to ship by tomorrow, if payment received today. 

Thanks for looking!
