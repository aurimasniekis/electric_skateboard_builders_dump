Hi All, 
Has anyone used these hub motors in their project? If so please can you let me know your thoughts as thinking of building another project. 

What KV do these motors produce? Also what is top speed can they achieve really and what set up did you use to achieve this. 

Thanks

To quote myself:
I have to say guys get on this! these motors are a beautiful piece of work and certainly at this time the best hub motors I have seen or ridden.
I try to make it my business to compare everything and be super critical so that you guys don't have to guess.
these things are awesome. and with the exception of maybe a slightly bigger grub screw on the internal collar there is not much you could do to improve.
as has been pointed out the shuddering that I experienced in my video was due to the VESC setting not these motors.

you can also see even a single one of these hub motors run off cheap hobbyking parts still has the torque to pull me along to a reasonable speed, so that's pretty impressive

It would be a massive shame for the esk8 builders community if these motors ceased to exist due to lack of backing. @jacobbloy has put the work in, but without community support they might just slip through the cracks.

in short BUY THESE MOTORS!


Should also point out that this is an absolute bargain! I paid much more for mine and I didn't get trucks lol.

That offer is super enticing and I have them in the cart already.
But before going through with this I have some questions:
- Is the protruding motor a problem on a single motor build? 
- can I mount them on other trucks to make two single motor boards out of one set?
- can the wheels be replaced - what needs to be done to replace them?

I am sure quality and functionality will be top notch so this is just to clarify if my plan to actually make two boards is feasible.

You can do single drive, but at this price it comes with 2 motors so why?

The trucks that you will receive one will be 150, the other 180 but the motors will make them both 180s

The wheels are replaceable with just 4 screws.

Well if you really want to know:
After my first build that I just finished today my sister and cousin were really impressed and seemed to love the idea of an electric longboard. As students they can not afford their own build, while I can probably manage to buy two for them. However for two dual boards I'd need 4 VESCs which is just too much for me to give away as presents. Two I should be able to manage.

How does it work when just one side is protruding on a truck like that? You seem to have planned for front and back by using different length trucks but how can you adjust left and right? Is there a spacer you can put on the truck?

the best way to deal with this would be to use 2 normal sized truck, then machine one down 15mm to then make them even, i might look into doing this and maybe start selling them. i can have tis done for you for a small fee.

@Mobutusan international shipping is a flat rate of $35 usd during the sale period.

Can you weight one of the hub motors with the thane (without the trucks)
we can double it for the pair of course

this hobby is too addictive…
I'm very interested for my second board 
I haven't even finished the first one yet and I'm already planing the next

@jacobbloy Is the quality of the urethane pretty decent on these motors? What approximate durometer are they? Under normal cruising conditions, are they going to hold up to high mileage?

I like big wheels and I cannot lie.

Are you guys serious? 90mm? Geez i thought 83mm was huge! Having said that. I came from riding street wheels at 52mm.  Then the step up to my electric boards went to 70mm i thought that was big.  Then to go up to 83mm for me is like monster truck size.. 

Having said all that I assume all you would have to do is change the urethane i suppose.

Yes but some of us dont have the capability to remove the core of the urethane properly for hub motor. Jacob would need to make a mould and produce different version.

I have to say that 83mm for The Netherlands or most eu countries are kinda small. Our road are half aspath half pavement with some tram and or metrolines. 70mm and 83mm get stuck in those gap many times.

Tried 90mm never want to go back! Although the size of 83mm with dropthrough provide sick stability, but its just not nice to keep stopping for obstacle especially on eboard. I guess in the end its just where you live.

Some of us can't get away with being that low, Guido. :wink: 

I thought 75mm on my old longboard was big until I got into this eSk8 thing. Now, I'm running 97mm & 83mm clones, and the 97's make my 83's look like baby wheels. I feel like the faster I go, the bigger wheels I want so I can mow over anything in my path (usually just sticks, rocks, large cracks and shitty pavement; no off-road, yet...). I'd probably be game for 97mm hub thane too, if it was offered, but I'm guessing that at some point, torque might start to suffer too much from the larger diameter. 

@laurnts I think the thane should be easy to replace or swap out on these motors, if I'm not mistaken. Do your hub motors have the thane glued or bonded to the hubs?

Hi guys I can do a 90mm wheel but the mould cost is $2000 so would been at least 50 ppl to buy 2 at $20 each and I still wouldn't be making a profit,

How about a 97mm wheel with a motor based on the 8080 outrunner? I'll do a small run of 10 motors for every one but the cost would be like $599 for a set.

Hey guys so I posted this sales thread only 40 hours ago and I have sold 11 sets of hub motors! Thanks you so much for every one and there support!
So I urge every one who has not brought a set yet to do so although I have another 15 days left of my sale I have also only set aside 25 sets of the sale and any more that I sell after this date or number will be at a higher price.
So what does this mean? 
If I keep the momentum I won't have any more sets left at this amazing price with in the next 48 hours so if you can get in quick before some one els does.

or 90mm @ unknown 

or 97mm 8080size @ $599? correct me if Im wrong

Also I would but these as a gift for a nephew who weight ~60kg, would the regular 83mm be more than adequate?

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/jacobs-hub-motors-review/2566

Also the issues mentioned in this thread have been fixed by increasing the set screw size, and adding 2 alignment pin holes that will mate with the trucks with this kit!
But can easily be added to any truck with the supplied drill jig.

I have to start by saying that I have never ridden carveon. Having said that im fairly sure that a carvon is just a re housed sk3 6374. Altho im happy to be corrected on that.
If that IS the case. These motors should wipe the floor with them these are a specifically built motor inside a wheel.. no cans hanging out the side on these.
Now i do ride sk3s on all my rides belt driven and the difference is shit and chocolate.

I think that @LEVer 's Carvons design is better than any other I've seen and the one I have because the motor is not actually in the weel but slightly off and that will help a lot against heat and prevent the magnets to lose position. The force applied on the wheel when riding on bumps or cracks is not going directly on the motor because it's not inside the wheel, so I guess magnets, stator and everything is much more protected, even if it's less pretty to some people, it totally makes sense to me. I'm curious about these motors too though and hopefully they will not fail like the one I have. :)

I'm sorry they are not the same motors as the ones from China, I have all of the parts made in my Cnc factory the sent to my motor factory and assembled!

And I have been developing this for 2 and a half years and have never had a wheel come off more the alloy cap touch the ground! I'm not some random buying Chinese motors I am a third year engineer student from Australia!

I didn't say any thing bad about your motors except the kv which is nothing about torque it's about amp draw! A 149kv motor with a 1:2 gear ratio will spin at half the speed of a hub with the same kv so a normal cruising speed is 30km/h the hub will use 50% less voltage at that speed then a geared system so if the torque requirement to move you on the board equals 500w then because the voltage is 50% less the amp draw will be 50% more then the geared system. But again nothing bad about your motor I like your design it's just bigger but your stator is also longer then mine.

I have nothing against you or hummina or any one els doing hub motors! Iv just chosen to do it my way!

I bought @jacobbloy  and @Hummie hub motors.   

They both are affordable, seem to be made from quality parts, and have real world testing behind them,  and also look nice....

I cant wait to compare the two, regardless i STILL got both dual pairs cheaper than one Carvon pair which is a big deal for me.

I just had to check the title of this thread to make sure I was on the right one. 

What are you doing on it exactly?
Bashing other people's products?
Man we don't like your shit cuz it's ugly and over priced. 

Get over it. You just chime in once in a while, talk shit and leave. 
Start a new thread about your own hubs and don't bring this one off track.

Well thanks for the support:grin:

And I only ever did small orders during my beta testing, but it was needed because I found after that first round with @Hummie and @torqueboards that just because I could fix the problems I had with the motors didn't mean every one could or at least wanted to. But I always tried to make things right
@Hummie got a refund and I sent @torqueboards a free set from the next beta round.

But since my latest beta round I have had not 1 unhappy customer, yes there have been some problems still but no product is ever bug free and this is why you have made improvements on your own motors, and I rectified all of these problems with replacement parts express posted to every customer who had them.

I hope to see more customer reviews like the one above in the coming weeks but sadly there is a vesc delay.

Nothing is wrong with my motors.  You need to understand what myself and Jacob are doing.  You are buying an aluminum shaft with a bearing sitting on it.  Either lock it down with retaining fluid where you then have to press the motor apart or suffer the consequences.  In my case I use retaining fluid and likely with the heat it has loosened on the steel side. So there is steel on steel rattle. That's fine because it's steel and just a bit of rattle.  If both sides of the bearing are sitting on aluminum, as in the case with Jacobs motors, be sure to add retaining fluid to both sides otherwise u will deform the aluminum.  I don't think he adds any intending for people to be able to remove the flange to replace the rubber.  If u left it loose u will rattle and ultimately deform 
This isn't new science.  You will not find bearings sitting on an aluminum shaft with a slide fit when there is a lot of load.

The bearings are donuts. Add retaining fluid to where they sit on the shaft(inside) and the bearing housing(outside).  Put it on the edge of both and then slide and twist the bearing on to evenly coat the surface.  Don't put too much on as if it gets in the bearing, which just has metal sheilds to protect it, it's bad news

Thanks for the advice mate! It will help me and others.

As for the alloy shaft my stator isn't glued on to the alloy shaft and uses a key way and 2 C-clips plus a press fit, but this allows for me to service them and quickly replace shafts is they are ever damaged!

I don't know if I will ever use this but might just replace the whole stators if any shaft damage occurred.
But the mechanical locking reduces the risk of the epoxy failing because of constant heating and cooling. I had this problem with my old 50mm stators because they got hotter.

So I have to say a massive thanks to every one who ordered!

We sold out of the alicated 25 sets of motors for the launch sale in a record 3 and a half days.

Iv had a few emails over night asking when more stock will be in, well I have just release another 25 sets that will be still delivered on the same time frame of first week of June.

Sadly the $249 price was great but can not be sustained if the goal is to continue selling them in the future. The new price is $399+ shipping this kit comes with 2x trucks and 2x motor wheels and 2x front wheels so still great value.

Again thank you to every one who has purchased.

So Iv been asking my self why would members of this community buy my hub motors, and I was always thinking well because of the time and engineering I have put into them to improve torque and efficiently until one customer contacted me said:

"The one reason I purchased your motors is because of the free in bias support and services you supply to all members of this community, I know that you will provide the best service for your motors if they ever so have any problems"

I want to thank this member first for the reconition for the work that I do to help as many as I can.
But this is true in the fact that I can supply support for more then just my motors for my customers but because of the time I have spent with and developing further the software, firmware and hardware has given me a greater understanding of the products used to drive these motors and this times you as a customer the advantage.

I don't meant to blow my own horn but I think all that have used my support packages or just contacted me for help would agree that my focus is 100% on customers and I think other bigger members could agree with me on this fact.

Thank you all who have purchased and I wish you all great success with your builds and encourage those who have put off buying because they missed the sale to still continue to order as you are getting much more then just motors!

At the moment I had paid for a new mould for the wheels to match an existing wheel but I am just finalising a deal with a very popular California company who will know be doing the front and back wheels this will mean no more China or home made wheels and the first professional grade hub motor wheel and to me this is exiting but has a price tag of $8000 but it will be worth every cent!

The company is lebeda one of the biggest manufacturer and first to produce urethan wheels for skates ect, they produce so many popular companies wheels orangatang, inboard, hamboards who is owned by the same guy as ABEC 11 so I wouldn't be suppreised if they also produce or have in the past produced ABEC 11 wheels. 
I will be trying to keep my theme of orange and black and add black on black but the wheel might have to be 90mm for some this will be great for others will reduce torque but we are looking into a 90mm mould and then stone grind down to 83mm But it's all about cost. 

The only restraint and reson why these awesome new wheels arnt going to make it to this order is because of the 90day mould production time but I will have more information hopfully in the next couple of days.

I was thinking if making an adapter that is permanently fixed to the hanger axle is a viable option either glued on and or welded. I'm not sure how to upload image on mobile but I had the idea that it threads onto the axle and it will have a hex pattern to keep motor/stator from moving forward or backwards and secured on with a locknut on the adapter. With the main benefit being easy removal and maintenance and also being able to choose wire direction.

Well like it or not, the most workable design for hub motor is one piece with the hanger that includes the axles. It add more cost but less problem in construction. No need to deal with thread lock torque issue and wheels - hub motor - hanger miss alignment. Hanger performance is not super significant in longboard overall performance, especially for eboard.

Well with Jacobs design we need to get trucks that are 30mm shorter to make the motors match the front wheels. So a 180mm truck and a 150mm truck. With an adapter it could go the the same way, but with a adapter with different hole depth there could be the option to cut the hanger like long haired boy does. I disagree that hanger performance isn't  significant after I tried Ronin cast trucks. My caliber trucks feel dead in comparison because they have no lean and Ronin's are even more stable but can still do 7 ft circle with a 30inch wheelbase. The main thing that that draws me to hub motors is that I can potentially have a drop through longboard and not have 1/2 inch in risers. Plus Jacobs original intention was to be able to use any trucks.

Everything looks great! Why dont you permanently sell them at a price near this! You are obviously making money or you wouldnt sell them at this price! Even if u were to sell them $75 more than you are now there would still be a huge demand.. Your are competing with carvon at this price.. Supply and demand, if the price is higher demand drops.. These need to be relatively the same price as buying 2 motors, 4 pulleys, and 2 mounts for them to be competitive.. All of this is my opinion.. It looks like you have a great product here!

@Tarzan My original mounting method works well if you can maintain the tension on the axel iv gone from a true 6065 alloy to a true7075 (not china fake crap) for the shaft and nut as this will also strengthen the threads, (stainless steel doubled the price for these parts).

the new alignment pins will mean a lot better hold to the truck, we have 2 alignment pins to stop rotation (this can easily be added to any truck and i plan to ship them with a drill template)
a set screw to hold a little tension on the axel to reduce vibration and a but that has a thread the whole length and applies a vice like effect onto the motor shaft to stop side ways movement.

@JLabs The price as it is currently is really good at $399 it means i make enough to add a finished touch to the whole thing it will add quality and means i can continue selling them. At $249 the demand is huge but i don't wish to undercut and control the market as its not worth it i want customers that love my design and my motors and will share there love with others, they will be willing to pay the higher price because they know that the extra touches iv added make it worth it. I have been working on my hub motor design for 2 years and have improved torque and fixed so many mistakes, i worked with Ryan and theo at inboard on there motor design during and after there kickstarter and gained and shared a lot of great and helpful theories of making these motors.

@Titoxd10001i agree that the hanger is important but not as important as the base plate when it comes to lean and stability.
i personally only ride precision trucks on my boards and when you do you will feel the difference.
I am a distributor for REY Trucks and plan to use there Trucks for a precision for a premium kit and the shaft will be imbedded into the motor and have there locking thread mech built in.

I believe it's all depending on the formula of the urethane. I've just ordered higher quality urethane SHRAB slightly more expensive formula than Orang Atang and Abec formula is SHRAA. SHRAB is more for slide, SHRAA is more for downhill.

If you pour caffeine on the servers will the thread wake up? I hopped on the Jacob motor bandwagon, someone else join me! You can be part of something new, a pioneer in today's fast paced world. We're all so keen to keep our satilite motors but if we didn't move on from logs in the Egyptian Era where would we be now? And at $299? You'd be crazy not to grasp that opportunity! So do it, do it for the wright brothers, do it for whoever invented the train, do it for yourself. I'm not sure if this is what you meant about mentioning the 5 day Sale @jacobbloy

Hi Jacob,
Just tried to contact you via your website and it seems it's been hacked perhaps? 
The contact tab goes straight to an American site selling erection enhancing powder!
I ordered on your first sale, wondering what the approximate dispatch date will be? (Order #540)

nice convo guys, but not gonna say any thing bad about hummies motors but there is no way he can sustain his pricing, its already doubled.

basically if you want to be a successful business you need to try and make 50% profit after tax, if you only make enough to pay for the stock you just sold then there is no point, also the goal should be to make enough to pay fro the stock you just sold (or depts) then buy the same amount of stock outright then the next order you can double your order and the order after that double it again then when you are ok with that stock level then you can keep buying the same amount but you can pocket some of the money to pay your self for the time you have spent and its a lot of time, think about talking to suppliers advertising packaging shipping, replying to customers.

so then at $200 for a pair of motors even if he is buying them for $50 each then he still has urethane (that at some point he will have to make professional moulds adding $10 per motor in an order of 500 motors. and this is a cheap mould) then shipping the motors from china to the USA and any import tax. plus any thing els that might come up.

thats $200 per set he has made no profit on had to deal with complaints and fixing problems and has no money to refund customers or fix under warranty so then he will charge you an extra $200 for new motors and no matter how strong you make then you will have some fail.

so if you want to support him or me then pay what they are worth and thats about $400 up!
or we will both just pull the plug one day and no one will have hub motors.

 My goals to make something that won't fall apart formost and then if that works maybe make some money and not burn anyone who helped me get there 

I don't know what guido is unhappy about but I'd like to know. There are few people that ride these motors I had made and I'd like all the feedback possible and have been waiting to hear. 

Anyone who bought them and isn't satisfied can get both parts made in steel with pressed bearings and magnets with a 300f Max temp. (Windings do 150c) as apposed to aluminum centered motors that therefore need slide fitted bearings.  225 in steel 200 in aluminum. 

!!!  The ONLY reason I'm not happy with the motors I sold so far is the rubber I fucked up and need to send everyone the slow cure stuff, which is good, and will do for free minus shipping and the motors are made with aluminum

  If you want more power to go up long steep things and you're heavy there are better options such as a belt.  In my mind this is a motor without any possible mechanical weaknesses.  I can't endorse Jacobs motors, even though they are bigger and will have more power because they're aluminum as well with slide fittings.  Aluminum is soft and can't be pressed and will always rattle and eventfully deform.  I'm not here to sell you my way and can endorse a lot of other products if you want to put together a board

But until you've tried the motors I had made on 12s with FOC you haven't really ridden them as they should be ridden.  Really only in the steel can I endorse my own motors 

Also these motors I'm selling...some have a tiny shim to make the bearings equally axaily loaded and some don't.  That's a variable and I could've maybe sent them with one bearing taking too much load or compression, especially with the aluminum and its expansion with heat. I don't know what Guido could be disappointed in and am guessing. 

Steel. 

I'd like to know guido!
I'm interested in hearing bad things about my motors from anyone.  This is a community for us to learn about stuff and I'm especially interested.

i don't understand! my motors would never go over 80c and thats spot heat. with a temp sensor inside of the winding i have only gotten the winding to 65c or 149f in the 2 locations i have fitted the sensors on my test motors and thats when pulling 30A phase current for over 2 mins (my motors never pull this much for that long even when climbing hills) i also still use SH magnets to allow for high heat.
but i think maybe my motor doesn't have a great problem with expansion because they don't get hot. the alloy shaft acts as a heat sink and sucks the heat out of the iron core it also transfers the heat well to the truck hanger allowing the shaft its self to sit at about 48c when the winding is at 65c.

expansion at 50c isn't that great with alloy.

talk to the guy who made the hubzilla v3 or they guy who does the hub monster. they all want efficiency and they gain this by reducing heat.

the first 5 lines of the hubzilla v3 sales page talks about reducing heat then gain efficiency. http://www.greyborgusa.com/hubzilla-v3-tech-specs/

just start looking at why they are getting so hot, you said it was the blue stuff but then you said the blue and not blue is about the same. u tested a few different winding and that was great to help find the best combo but what are your motors drawing current wise?

iv never ridden your motors i haven't tested them so I'm not saying there bad! but i am saying heat is bad!
Heat is the worlds inefficiency. if heat wasn't a thing of concern then we would have an endless energy supply because heat means losses so the loss of energy.

so lets say current is the problem. I'm not gonna compare our motors but lets say you have a ebike hub motor At 900rpm it would require phase current of 405A, half from each controller, but the copper losses in the motor would be almost 2700W, and with the 115W of iron core losses above efficiency would be over 87%. That seems pretty good, but if we double the voltage and gear it down by half, then we're turning 1800rpm and only need half the current. While iron core losses go up by 205W, the copper losses go all the way down to 681W for efficiency of 95%. :shock: That's a reduction in heat generated in the motor of about 2000W, and heat is our overriding limitation. Copper losses go up by the square of current is what causes this. we can scaled this down but the effect is seen a lot bigger in the bike motor.

so we know that the rpm and voltage is about the same on our motors but if it is current causing heat then you just need to find why it is high, if its not current then it is some thing els but the copper losses and iron losses are still there and can't be ignored even if your magnets can handle it and your coper has heat protection if any thing that heat protection will increase heat because it is an insulator.

just think if you have a 250f motor then those losses are multiplying and you will end up with this motor that only is 50% efficient so you have a motor with lets say 750w wasted in heat.
