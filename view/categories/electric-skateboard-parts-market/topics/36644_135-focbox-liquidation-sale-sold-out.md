at the moment 7 , but i've got more coming. My shop doesn't allow orders out of stock so if it fades out you'll know i ran out. I should have another batch coming in a couple weeks though, provided i can sell all these and pay the bill.

i tried to set one aside but they were to quick. By the time i got in to -1 the inventory they murdered me at the register. 

Sorry bro. 

When they come back in stock i'm listing them at $145. I think the world needs a lower price on focboxes.

i‚Äôd appreciate that a lot üòÅ

xt90 male
3 sets of bullets (5.5mm preffered)

no man, i said everything BUT xlr, so you'll have to source that on your own.

should be easy tho, LHB, amazon, radio shack if you still got em in your area, fry's here in california, etc.

oooo that's the click in type. They'll work on the standard ebike charger just make sure you always push that thing in or you'll end up yanking the port out in frustration without thinking. Don'
t know how many mic cables i destroyed tripping over clicked in cables during practice when i was in one of those drunk and rowdy bar bands in my twenties.

If it's genuine, Neutrik is considered good stuff.

I'd have skipped the locking for this application though :)
