Super Build Bro.
So, after riding your single hub, how's the power comparison between single and this monster?
Looking forward to some cool videos...

The power feels like double because everything is bigger yet all the parts are the same as my single. I've only rode it a few times in a small parking lot, as it's been rainy in my town for the past few days. This weekend I'll be doing some testing to get some specs going.

I'm really happy with it, although its a bit of a beast for a guy my size. However, I think anyone over 175-180 lbs will feel right at home on it. I think having a single and double build is a perfect combo. I'm already thinking of my next build :smile:
