Hi all,

I'm selling this battery system. All parts are taken out of an Enertion Space Cell. 

Asking price is : $250
I will cover shipping in the U.S.

The parts are:
-30x LG LGDBHE21865 18650s. 10S3P (It's stack 2 high because my build demanded it. However, if you want to flatten it so its 2 high, just cut the heat shrink and flip it open like a book.) || -> _ _
-1x 10s BMS. Im pretty sure it's 30A max. @onloop?
-1x LCD fuel gauge
-1x Power Switch
-1x Charging Port
-1x Enertion Fast Charger
I'll throw in the enclosure for free.
