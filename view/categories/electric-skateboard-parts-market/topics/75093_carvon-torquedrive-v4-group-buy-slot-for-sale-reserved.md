I want 469 US$ for them and that is what I paid.
In this price are 70 US$ shipping included, if you are located in Europe, Asia or Australia the shipping is the same, if you are in the US or Canada, please ask @LEVer for the partial refund.
The Drives are supposed to ship next week! 
I will ask you to pay after I have everything organized with @LEVer.
