I got these motors as part of a DIYEboard kit, however due to their kv rating I will not be using them. They would be perfect for a 6S-8S setup or to be used with the DIYeboard/meepo/Chinese dual belt esc (designed for this ideally). I would be willing to trade them for any lower kv motors or anything really. Lemme know what you've got. Will add pics later but they're all plain black with no branding and have never been used...oh they're NOT sensored. Thanks for looking.
