One of the biggest challenges faced when building your own electric skateboard is mounting the components safely onto the underside of your skateboard deck.

Most wood decks are around 10-15mm thick, some even thicker. This is wasted space! & it adds to the overall weight of your build. With the use of carbon fiber & foam core technology it is possible to remove the middle section of the deck & create structure around an internal cavity. This allows you to safely house your expensive electronics inside an environmentally sealed capsule.

So this is what we came up with..

With the Enertion All-In-One Carbon Fiber deck all of your electronic components (except the motors) can be installed safely inside, not only does this look awesome it will make for one of the lightest electric skateboard builds you can build at home.

The components housing is sealed below the deck to prevent dust and moisture contacting your electrics. You simply remove a few screws at the top and can access your battery for a quick swap out.

The All-In-One Carbon fiber deck is compatible with the Enertion S.P.A.C.E Cell or most common 3 Cell LIPO batteries available from the hobby store. So now you can fully customize your ride. Range VS Weight, Torque VS Top Speed, the choice is yours.

**UPDATE:** We decided to modify the mold early in the production process to further increase strength. Unfortunately this put us behind our schedule by about 3 weeks.

The good news is we are pushing forward and now have the final production unit just days from being ready. 

Here are some photos of the deck fresh from baking in the mold!

The deck pictured above is in its raw state, it needs to be coated in a hard epoxy outer shell which makes it look shiny! and completely seals the fibers! There will be nuts inserted into the lip around the top of the enclosure so you can fasten the lid down with screws. The lid is made from a flat sheet of Fiber Glass.

**Stay tuned for more updates coming soon!**

nice. interested to see how they hold up to some real world skating.
I do a bit of carbon work myself and I have got to say making a deck has crossed my mind alot more than once. but the cost and unknown factors have always stopped me.

let me know if you need some testers ;)

This picture below is showing the nut inserts which are on both sides of the deck, it is designed for attaching a carry handle. but as it is 1/4-20 thread type, you can direct mount go pro to your deck using these common adapters

This picture below is with a Fiber Glass Lid, Originally i went with fiber glass because it doesn't interfere with the RF signal as CF can, but i don't like the look of it, so now am remaking the lid with 100% CF. then you just have the antenna coming out the port below.

I wouldn't worry about getting the lid made from carbon, like you said, harms the RF and will be covered by grip tape anyway.

No full skateboard test done yet, probably start that in about one week once i get final production sample.

load & stress testing done... its rated for 200kg. 

Yeah I know it's going to be covered with grip but i just want it all to look the same...  I'm thinking of getting some grip tape laser cut so that it has cutout so you can see the CF.

I'd be willing to stress test a unit in the real world for a few weeks and send it back when I'm done. Believe me when I say I can beat the crap out of something and tell you what's wrong with it. It would make a great article too. The fact that its rated to handle over 400 pounds is pretty serious.

Haha... Thanks for the offer!... but I don't run a library ;) and what would I possibly do with a soiled deck after you've had your way with it ... with blood and sweet and dirt all over it... uww

However you should know... I'm currently selling them at a tiny fraction above cost price.... so bery good time to buy!.... also the AUD is low against the USD... you get like a 30% discount..... Also Price will go up as soon as I get the production unit and complete my QC.....

Yeah I might make one eventually.....but you need big wheel cut outs though to prevent wheel bite...  most of us have large wheels... also it gives less room for motors under the deck.... so you definitely need hub motors. Or rear mounted (out the back of the deck - not under it) motors.

But next up i will have a drop deck. Approx one inch drop.... it will be primarily used for my all terrain wheels.... which I am currently redeveloping.

Just look how good and clean and wholesome that Florida dirt is!*

## \#22 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2015-08-22T06:36:22.071Z Reads: 131

It 100% carbon fiber shell, made using prepreg carbon fiber sheets then pressure molded & baked. The core is made with a divinycell foam. Where the truck holes are it is solid carbon fiber so that you can tighten the truck bolts and not worry about damaging the structure. Where there are some threaded nuts around the enclosure, for holding the lid down, it has some aluminium plate that is drilled & tapped, it is not structural.

There are no wood or metal reinforcements.

So to summarise I suppose you simply call it Carbon Fiber & Foam Core. It will be very lightweight & really strong

Since it has a kicktail, are you protecting the tail from getting mashed? Even when just kicking the board up?

It would be horrible to see a messed up kicktail made out of carbon fiber. :frowning: 

Just a suggestion.

I'll be getting some type of "engineering plastic" cnc'd for the kicktail. It will mount on the underside so that you can perform a skid stop without grinding the CF.

Maybe somthing for the nose too...

It all cost $ though.... so we just have to wait & see if it is included or not

I will cut a window in the carbon lid so that the fuel gauge and the charge port and switch are accessible.

I could only guarantee the position to cut holes after I mocked it up in real life.... with the S.P.A.C.E Cell in position.

Haven't riden it yet. Only got it last night! Now I am on baby duties for the next few days :frowning:

Right after i typed out that question i went home and then my instagram blew up with onloop's pics showing the cutout placement for the buttons and display. It makes me want to move my voltage display to the top of my deck. Possibly in the nose or somewhere else useful. I was able to source one in red of course. Maybe that will happen when i make the new box. 

Speaking of baby duty, seen here is my cheif trials enginner thoroughly inspecting my helmet before launch:

does it get super slick? I know with the coating over the carbon fiber it will be smooth, but I'd be worried about grip at higher speeds... and who would want to put grip tape on a board like that!

have you looked into that clear griptape that arbor uses on their boards? I think evolve also uses it on their bamboo boards...

if not, maybe cutting out two patches of griptape to put one in the front, and one in the back, right under your feet. kinda giving it the look of the second gen zboard, but instead of weight sensors, it'd be grip tape.

Just been speaking with my battery engineers... might be able to just squeeze in a 10S4P battery inside the enclosure! This makes it 10S at 10AH.... 360Watt hours.... omg.... with my 10s3p i get about 30kms (probably more) so with 10S4P it's about 40km range... depending on riding style it's about 2hrs.

Sounds like you are prepping to offer a larger space cell soon? 
Am in the planning/design stage of inlaying a 6.35mm sheet of aluminum into my deck, that will have a flat space recessed into it large enough to securely mount the current space cell. 
Sounds like this new battery would be the same width to accommodate this new cf deck, but how much longer do you figure it will be? Might just plan around this bad boy instead.

The thing is going to get scratched up eventually no matter what you do to it. Your shoes pick up rocks and dirt, every time you step on it the finish will slowly deteriorate. May as well just grip it and forget about babying the finish.

I don't think you should offer anything more than a standard sheet of grip.

traditionally skaters have always gripped their own decks and customised to whatever they like best.
you said it yourself that you want to put it into the hands of the community. give people a deck and a sheet of grip and see what comes back.

Some of them may be a little deep but there are a few with perfect depth that probably wont bother your feet. We used to try riding snowboards with no bindings down the mountain on rainy days. So I had a board covered in stomp pads. Super fun!
