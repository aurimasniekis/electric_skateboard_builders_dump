I've got a couple of sets of wheels that I'm not going to use.
As in the title, odd coloured 97mm clones. Done a couple of miles as I've now swapped this deck back to Kegels because of wheel bite.
Also new unused set of green 83mm clones.
97mm clones £30 plus the cost of postage of your choice.
83mm clones £23 plus the cost of postage of your choice.

2weeks ago i bought 97mm red flywheel clones in Amazon for $27 shipped.  In the past I've bought 83mm and 90mm off eBay fro $20 - $23 shipped.  They are incredibly cheap in the US.
