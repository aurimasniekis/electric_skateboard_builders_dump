First of all, seeing that this is a diy community, I don't think your store will get much love here. You have almost no selection of diy parts or kits.

Its mostly electric junk. The best board you have is a boosted, which is a board many on here agree is not a high standard electric skateboard.

Then, you have a set of an FVT 120a esc with a generic motor. You claim the value is almost $600, but I'll give you deal of $158. First off, the motor based on the specs and the generic-ness, does not seem to be very expensive. And the FVT 120a esc can be bought for $65. So $90 for that motor seems like a rip off to me. Either way, weather its worth $150 of not, there's no reason to put a price tag of basically $600 crossed out next to it, that's just a shady business practice.

Overall, the ones who will succeed most on this forum are those actually focusing on servicing the needs of the electric skateboard community. I can tell you that you have nothing of any value to me, and I know many others who are actually building their own stuff will agree.

the standard belt you sell is a 225mm hdt3 belt, which wouldnt work on any board made on this site.
