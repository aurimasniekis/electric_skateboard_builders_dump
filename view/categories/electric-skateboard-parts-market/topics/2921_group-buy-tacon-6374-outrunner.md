I've been speaking with the manufacturer of Tacon motors about ordering 20 of the 6374 version of the Tacon Big Foot 160.  It'd be about $60 each for the sensorless and about $65 each for the sensored plus probably another $10 to ship them each.  Preferably Continental US only.  Is there any interest in this?  Sensored or sensorless?

@claudiofiore88 Yup! Sensored pls. Do we get a color choice? Black :)

Yeah, I suppose for an extra $5 it's worth having the option for sensored even if you don't plan on using it.  I haven't spoken about color.  Any thoughts on KV?  I was thinking that 200kv would be the sweet spot for a 10s system.

@Karmannghiagirl With a forum full of guys, I don't see that being a popular choice.  I was told all black or black and red.

@delta_19 It'd be like $46 to ship to Canada via USPS International Flat Rate Box.

@willpark16 Shipping time has not been discussed yet.

and yes i want two of them, maybe even four. 

So they'll just make them for you in batches of 20? seriously?

@claudiofiore88 did you discuss shaft length, keyway, or a flat spot on the shaft? it would be cool to have a shaft long enough to support a 15mm pulley if possible.

-yes 200KV or up to 245KV would be great. 10s makes sense as the reference point.

@scrant For an extra few dollars, it's worth having.   As for the same motor as @chaka, it could be.  I know his is branded as Maytech which @onloop mentioned is a reseller, so the price would be significantly more, I believe. Also, he's had like 2 other threads about motors that never went anywhere as far as I know.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/maytech-brushless-6355-sensored-un-sensored-230kv-motor/575/26

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/modified-e-max-5335-200kv-coming-soon/1106/10

@cmatson  I believe it has an 8mm shaft.  That'll be confirmed when I get an email back.

@longhairedboy They wanted me to order a batch of 100, but I didn't think there'd be anywhere near that amount of interest, and I don't have a few thousand dollars lying around.

A keyway was talked about.  From my understanding, it's included in the price that was discussed.  This will be confirmed before anything is finalized.  What would the shaft length need to be in order to fit a 15mm pulley?

Community and friendship is when a group of people buy together from a known source with verified pricing ect.... I would be down to buy some of these if the are in fact the next size above the tacon 160 but @claudiofiore88 seems to be dodging that question.

[/quote]

you think?................

just because a factory says they sell "tacon" doesn't mean anything.... my advice is don't believe it until you see it. Also, the outside aesthetic of a motor has nothing to do with its quality... Do you want somthing that looks like a tacon? or performs like one? two very different things. It's easy to make a cheap motor. Also you need to talk about the stator size, not the bell size.... its the stator that is important, i have had samples of 6374 motors arrive with half an inch of nothing at the end of the bell... 

you definitely need to get a sample (or a few) and thoroughly test the fuck out of it.... I suggest getting them to send you a built one & also a completely disassembled one.

....... then maybe consider asking people for money....

@onloop Thank you for kind suggestions and warnings of shady manufacturer practices. The stator size for a 6374 motor would be 5345, correct? I wasn't asking for people's money yet. More of a feeler thread.

On a side note, in order to use your 12mm wheel pulley, I would need to order your trucks as well?

@onloop Yes, I'm aware that's it's not a Tacon, but thank you for pointing that out though.  

@willpark16 I wouldn't doubt it's the same motor. It does look similar.

 @JLabs There's a link higher in the thread to RC Universe on different manufacturers of different motors. Tacon was speculated to be manufactured by XYH, so that's who I contacted. I tried first reaching to hobbypartz for who their manufacturer is for their Tacon motors, but they just straight up I ignored my request.

suppose it depends how precious your time is, modifying shaft & attaching appropriate cables.... maybe 1hr or 3

also i offer a warranty specifically for esk8ers

most of the hobby stores will see your mods & deny warranty immediately...

ALSO, if you happen to buy an [Enertion mount & R-SPEC motor kit](http://www.enertionboards.com/categories/diy-electric-skateboard-kits/build-single-motor-mount.html) together you get your R-SPEC for only $99

seems like a no brainer to me... in-stock & ready to ship - for FREE!

_p.s. So, Tacon? are they the motors that are never in stock?_

I came here for Tacons. If its not a Tacon, an NTM, an SK3, or an R-SPEC, I'm not interested. I don't have time to waste on clones, plenty of other people have already done that for me. 

Also if you did manage to order 100 genuine Tacons that were customized in some way such as color or ciclip grooves or keyways or whatever you would have zero difficulty moving them in my opinion. The market is salivating at the prospect of a sub $80 high quality 6374 outrunner that is actually available for purchase.

What, WHAT? if it's taking you 3 hours to put 3 bullets and a flat spot on a motor I feel sorry for you. It takes 15 minutes for the bullets and longhairedboy can put a flat spot on a shaft in 3 minutes.

And that $99 is before shipping so still not worth it over a cheap good motor like a tacon or sk3

my first ever attempt at putting together a drive train (alien) took several days, being so careful not to make any mistakes, i had saved all my money up (i didn't have much money) i really didn't want to make a mistake, i had no idea how to do anything...I was also afraid to ask stupid questions on the forums because i didn't want to look like an idiot...

so yes... it was a bloody slow process.....

I think it's important to constantly empathise with the mindset of a beginner... the day you forget what it was like when you knew nothing is the day you stop thinking about how you can better educate the masses and its when you stop innovating as a product designer.

you are the guy who wants to do everything as cheap as possible & disregards quality & performance along the way.... _but learning from mistakes is important!_

you are the guy who wants to consume the info & resources for free but then supports the cheap Chinese clone supplier who doesn't contribute to the community or industry.

you are the guy that wastes the time of small business owners trying to get them to sell you individual parts when they clearly say that they do not..... _time is money_

you are the reader of the esk8 forum not a builder of esk8.... _not a contributor._

you are the guy who gets fooled by the false economy.... _but hopefully learns from it_

you are not my target market... & that's cool by me

no offense!

girl*

1. Cheap =/= crap just as expensive =/= quality

2. I have not bought anything yet except a zboard off craigslist, so thats kinda unfair to say that i dont support the community. currently my plan is to do a diy 18650 battery, buy a vesc from @chaka since out of all the vesc suppliers I have heard the most good things about him, a pulley system from you since it seems like the best option, and I am currently debating on what I want to do for the motor (still debating about trying out using a motor from a drill or cordless saw).

3. I admit that was a questionable thing I did with metroboard, I was in a mood that day and wanted to see if i could beat the system 

4. I really hate this thought that you have to build something in order to comment or contribute on it.

5. false economy, good buzzword, i like it :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

@claudiofiore88 since you are already in talks with this manufacture you should ask what it would cost to get custom machining on the rotor. Something that can handle being pummeled by rocks would be great.  I love tacons but the open design of an airplane motor doesn't do well 40mm above the pavement at 30mph. I burn though a motor every month or two due to shredded windings.

Target market or not, she's still right. budget is boss. 

I've purchased your kits (and complete boards) for all the reasons you pontificate about...because I'd rather spend my time building/riding than sourcing parts, AND it's in my budget. If it wasn't, I would be sourcing parts individually and walking line between quality/price as best I could. I know you offer quality products, but I'm sure yours aren't the ONLY quality products.

I've decided to scrap the group buy idea. I feel like I've bit off more than I can chew in this endeavor. Anyone who wants to take over can find the source info higher up in the thread. If a moderator like @onloop or @psychotiller or @longhairedboy or @lowGuido can close the thread, that would be wonderful.  Thank you.

What are you on about, everyone is all for it. That is if they are real tacon 160s if they aren't and they're alien then we have a problem.

That's the thing, I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Last thing I want is everyone getting motors that looks like Tacon 160's but perform like shit.

I mean its a learning experience, and I think if if even looks like a tacon it might be worth testing. If china says no and we only do what we showed you in that picture they sent you then tell them to fuck off. If its a tacon then it might be worth it

Your motors are overpriced m8. #enertionexposed 

But like @delta_19 said, 5.5mm bulets and a flat spot take less than 10 min if you are proficient at diy electronics. Tacons and SK3s are half as expensive and have good performance. As you like to say, you cant beat real world testing.

Yeah that was really uncalled for, you make good stuff but it's outburst like this that really makes me iffy of you
[/quote]

this might sound strange.... but i couldnt give a fuck if you are iffy about me.... i am not actually here to make friends with everyone & i don't want to sell my products to everyone either..... I am not here to be the cheapest player there is either! that business model is doomed to fail, just ask @Hummie 

I am sure I could make lots of freinds really quickly.... i could offer a lovely little discount code to all members and make them really happy.... but that is not healthy for my business & i guarantee they will still want high level servie & warranty if the shit aint good. So choose to like me or not... your call... but don't waste your time telling me how to structure my pricing....

ALSO, I will continue to freely speak my mind (as i hope you all do)...especially when people directly question my decisions, if you want to call it an outburst so be it.... i am a fucking passionate guy... maybe i should refrain from typing on this forum late at night after i have had a few single malts... but i really don't want to filter myself to try & create a false persona so people feel better about themselves... 

my primary goal is to build a sustainable business, that is scalable & will be here for the long term.... I want to be able to offer a high-level of support & ensure my customers get the best possible electric skateboards.

if people want the low cost option that is fine by me... In fact I made a video explaining exactly how to do it.... I litereally give my design away for free... just dont bitch about it if it stuffs up...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yBgsT65UPg


Buy my stuff or not, i don't care..... All i care about is that people understand that building their electric skateboard is fun & often much better than what they can buy in a box.... But i also want people to understand the cheapest stuff might actually work out to be more costly in the long run....

**The false economy will bite you on the arse** when you least expect it. so all these people with zero dollar budgets who are trying their hardest to keep the cost down might actually be better off spending a tad more and getting a better result.... i know this from experience.

ALSO, buying the cheapest, untested, motors from some random chinese factory is a near-guaranteed way to loose lots of money....once again just ask @Hummie  

There are no shortcuts in this game... unless you specifiy every single little detail about how the motor should be manufactured, specify all elements that you desire, you will get their stock standard CHEAPEST model & it will fail.....

It takes months to get a product right... it also takes lots of money for samples.... lots of paitence...

if you want to get good motors, heres is a rough guide to dealing with china motor factories....
1. research your suppliers
2. contact between 4 or 5 of them
3. if any actually reply try to get some straight answers out of them & convinve them to sell to you.... **they dont like dealing with the small guys.**.. ALSO, Don't directly ask them if they sell this "brand name" motor becasue wether they do, or do not, they will just say YES to try to get your business.
4. Spend hours & hours discussing your requiremensts. this could go on for weeks.
5. try to convinve them to actually make somthing to your desired spec. (you need to know what you are talking about or they will take advanatage of you)
6. finally get a price out of them for samples.
7. wait for samples to arrive 4-6 weeks, maybe more.
8. test samples, try to determine if everything is up to standard? 
9. talk with suppliers again, get all the stuff fixed that they missed, get more samples...
10. wait another 4-6 weeks. you have probably spent between $500-$1000 already.
11. hopefully you now have a working production grade sample, now its time to negotiate.
12. try to get the best deal from the final few suppliers you have been dealing with... remember the lower the price the higher the chance of the quality being compromised.
13. by this time you should have a decent relationship starting to build, some trust is required in this kind of transaction... & now you will choose your final supplier.
14. Now try to convince them to do a small batch of custom motors, they will prpobably be talking 500qty at a minimum.
15. if you are lucky you can get the qty lower, but the price **will go up**.
16. they will request 100% upfront, you will try to negotiate just 50% deposit.
17. wait for 4-8 weeks, maybe much more for your order to get made... **expect delays.**
18. they will eventually want the rest of payment... 
19. you will ask for photos to proove that they are making everything to spec... this alone can be a battle
20. you also decide it is wise to get another final smaple sent just to be sure.. there goes another $100 for shipping.
21. you deicede to pay your final installment & get the motors shipped.
22. you wait for 7-10 days for shipping & hope you don't get hit with import duties 
23. you get the product & pray-to-god that everything is done properly... this is 50/50.. there is a good chance they changed somthing without telling you.


anyway... good luck.

I came here for Tacons. If its not a Tacon, an NTM, an SK3, or an R-SPEC, I'm not interested. I don't have time to waste on clones, plenty of other people have already done that for me. 

Also if you did manage to order 100 genuine Tacons that were customized in some way such as color or ciclip grooves or keyways or whatever you would have zero difficulty moving them in my opinion. The market is salivating at the prospect of a sub $80 high quality 6374 outrunner that is actually available for purchase.
[/quote]

According to RCUniverse, the NTM Prop-Drives are made by the same manufacturer as well as a few turnigy motors (not the sk3's though).  I don't have that kind of cash to drop on 100 motors anyway, but I do agree they'd be sold out quickly.

I may go ahead and just end up testing the sample motor.  I'll see what happens on Monday when the manufacturer gets back to me.

Thanks for taking the risk and getting a sample for everyone here interested. Hope a comparison can be made to a real tacon 160
