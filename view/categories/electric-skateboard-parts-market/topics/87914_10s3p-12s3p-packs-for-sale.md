2 batteries for sale. Was using both for 3-5 months each or so, upgraded both builds I had them in for bigger batteries. Both are used obviously, but no issues with either and both work fine. If someone wants both of them I will do a package deal with a discount. LMK any questions anyone has. Also, I do have a couple of different enclosures that I used with each of these if anybody wants to grab one of those to go with it for a little extra. No cracks, breaks, or anything of the nature on either. Both black and made by psychotiller.
