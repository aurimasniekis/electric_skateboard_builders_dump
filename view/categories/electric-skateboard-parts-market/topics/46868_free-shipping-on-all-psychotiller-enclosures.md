I‚Äôve been looking at the enclosures and just been waiting to pull the trigger but I think this will make me pull the trigger? When do you think this will be going until?

Haven't been to your site in a while, awesome selection! If anyone is thinking about it, do it. My psychotiller enclosure is super tough and has taken some abuse. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another. Also, he's got good deals on his batteries.

Try typing it in manually?? Lol more then likely are carrying the  text's Meta data(font type, size, etc.) of the text with it as your copying from browser to browser...

Perfect example of this is if you have Microsoft word or such text editor. You can actually choose which pieces of the Meta data you would like to paste with the text. 

![24xbny|300x262](upload://5fdk6PCIB3R80T5lZ34kg4ygnj3.jpg)


To further touch on that.. the Meta data to psychos code processor would see the Meta data characters as invalid to a matched code..

It was a little long on the front, got into the wheel wells but didn't cause any issues. No bite with 97mm wheels and it's easily trimmed if you want, I didn't.
