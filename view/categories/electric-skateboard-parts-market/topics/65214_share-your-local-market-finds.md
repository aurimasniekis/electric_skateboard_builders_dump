I thought it might be cool for us to pass on good deals to others that we don't need or show what we managed to find from the local and internet markets.

Share your finds and help others get a good deal.

Edit: As suggested make sure you mention the location of the items, Perhaps at the start of your post so that people can quickly see where it is.

I'll start this off with a board I've just found in Wales that I don't need right now but is a good deal for someone.

It's a new AOB (German) Plutonite Deck in the newest graphics. The guy has even grip taped it.

Can people post what general geographic location they are in? I feel like excessive shipping would defeat the purpose on some of these finds!

Recently came upon these on ebay:

![image|479x388](upload://dE3CWDsmCVOvMy9IUkTdZMy6vgs.jpg)
https://www.ebay.com/itm/1-Module-Motor-Metal-Spur-Gear-50-20T-Width-10-Set-Kit-Ratio-5-2-Wheelbase-35mm/262682640209?hash=item3d291aff51:m:mn-FUMHpAVN6NDV3TbS-pVA

With some modification, it should be possible to fit them and try them out :thinking:
