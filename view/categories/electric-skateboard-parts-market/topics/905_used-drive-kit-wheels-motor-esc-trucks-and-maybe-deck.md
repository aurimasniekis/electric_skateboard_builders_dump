I'm selling a black one of these product/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-with-drive-wheel-kit/ for paris trucks and 16T motor pulley. I'll also include a set of 4 blank pro flywheels and a tacon 160 motor. I'm looking to get $200 for the whole setup shipped to the USA as it has only been ridden for about 5 miles around my neighborhood.

Will you consider just selling the motor mount? I dont need the wheels or the pulleys.

Perhaps in a few days, I'm trying to sell the whole package to convert one of my boards to dual hub motors.

If you end up selling the mount by itself, i'd be interested in the wheels, wheel/pulley assemblys, belt, and motor!

Thanks guys, I'm still waiting on an update for Hummina's hub motors before I sell this. I think his last post on the topic was a few days ago, saying that orders would start in a few days (I probably should've waited before posting this thread).

@NNGG @JT_Clemente  Still for sale for you guys. I've just been really busy for the past few weeks. The z-flex trucks (which I think are paris clones, because I have been using them with the mount) and the torqueboards 6s esc are also for sale. I may sell the deck if there's interest, but it depends on shipping costs. I'll send pp info in a day or two if you are still interested. I need funds for my mountainboard builds :grin:

Hmm. I was thinking of adding a extra motor to my setup, so I would need a mount and a drive kit. How much would that be?

Did you ever have any problems with the motor mount and Paris trucks? I've read about people having alignment issues in relation with the wheel pulley as the Paris truck's angle throws the alignment slightly off. If not I'm still very interested in the wheels, pulley, and the motor mount then as well!

you can actually see in his original post (the pic) that the motor mount is slightly angled outward.

What's your opinion on it? I have seen people shaving the truck itself down, however I don't trust myself to do it properly. Is it acceptable to use it as-is (without the modification)?
I'm thinking of just going with calibers and an adjustable mount so I don't have to deal with the headache of trimming it down.

having a slightly off-angle mount will make you go through belts faster, as there is uneven wear. 

calibers are nice because they don't taper at all, so the mount is straight regardless of where you have it set on the truck.
