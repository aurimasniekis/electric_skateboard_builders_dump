Only a month old. I only have 1 motor and 1 esc that I'm selling. The specs can be found here (http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__41051__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6364_213kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor_US_Warehouse_.html). Replaced the 4mm bullet connectors with 5.5mm bullet connectors.

I'll shoot you a message about the sk3, as I am serious about buying it-

just one thing: 
did you grind a flat spot for the pulley, did you make a keyway, and did you just torque down on the set screw?
could you also post a pic of the motor where the shaft is shown (i.e. off the mount) 

Thanks!

I posted a thread called "Electric Longboards for Larger Riders" which sort of explains why I'm selling these items.  I'm gonna try a few people have suggested, so I'm going to postpone selling these items for now.
