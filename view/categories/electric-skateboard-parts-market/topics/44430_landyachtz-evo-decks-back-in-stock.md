This might be a dumb question, but does @treenutter, aka Red Ember Boards make a wedged/dewedged deck like the Evo?

Ok, dumber question. Why not? Lol. Seems like a whole untapped market for his custom decks, given how popular the Evo seems to be.

I will admit, I like the Evo a lot now.  I was not such a fan at first, but I've changed out my bushings and risers and now it rides great.  I would love to see @treenutter make some wedge/dewedge decks.  I assume he doesn't because of the cost of the mold. 

What do you say oh minor god of decks :slight_smile:

Thx @Mobutusan and @mmaner... the interest is noted! I try really hard to keep other deck designs out my head, and focus on my own riding experience and style for inspiration; If I experiment with wedging and dewedging, it wouldn't likely be anything like the Evo. 

What do you like about the evo design? I've never ridden one, but I appreciate the added high-speed stability. Is it much work to get your angles and turning just right. Are there implications for spacing w motors and mounts? I've seen people use wedged risers to remove the angle that the wedged deck presents :man_facepalming:

That's the thing with the Evo.  At least it took me a lot of testing and a significant amount of time to get it 'dialed in".  It was worth it, as now it rides incredible... It's a beast.

I love my Evo deck it feels super stable at speed but if I Chuck my weight into it, it turns and carves very nice. 

But yes you do need to fiddle with set ups for your own set up to feel right for you.

I use 1/4 risers so it was problematic to get the 6374 motors mounted, but it's doable. I'm not wedding, some are.   The biggest difference for me was bushings. I'm using a combination of riptide tall, standard and chubby in 93 and 96 durometers to keep it carvy and stable. I typically don't go faster than 20-22 so I can't say about high speed setups.

I have a similar set up with 98a on both road side bushings and front board side is 93 and rear board side is 95 with 96a pivot cups all from riptide. Made a huge differece especially going above 40mph.

like about the evo design?
[/quote]

The raked deck. The front sits lower then the back. So inherently all your weight always feels like it's over the front trucks all the time. The front and rear are +15/-15. There was a variant back in the day called a Chinook which was a slightly shorter evo like deck. Super agressive w concave and +10/-10.

I used to have a chinook, 10 years or so ago.  Wasn't it longer than the Evo?

Original Evo was 41" with a 35" wheelbase.. Chinook was 40" with a 32" wheelbase. Evos after 2013 are 39.5"

I talked to the guys over at LY and they told me their new line (with a possible evo update) will be released in the spring of 2019.

They wouldn't tell me if they are actually refreshing the evo or not....just rumors!

I have an evo alternative deck and comes custom artwork and glass frit grip for a little more than 50 bucks more than a new evo has about a 1 inch drop 40” long 9.75” wide narrows to 8.5” with a 31” wheel base if someone wants an Evo styled deck.

Only sad part is, I wish the flytrap were on top with clear frit and the green CF on the bottom along with the enclosure.
