I thought it would be nice to have a place for us to share some of the great deals and sale items that pop up on Hobby King from time to time. Sometimes things that you really want or need, might go on sale at a huge discount, and you may not even know it, if you're not actively looking for it. So, this could be a way for us to collectively keep up on eSk8 related hobby parts that occasionally go on sale. 

First, this is a link to a site to find buddy codes, so you can get a discount even if something is not currently on sale. 
http://rcsearch.info/hobbyking/buddy/

Of course, you can also wait for a few minutes while viewing an item for a discounted price offer to appear, but that doesn't always seem to work for me. 

So, I'll start with some interesting sale items I found since they are having some big Hobby King Kong Sale right now.

Thanks? At least they weren't any cheaper or you would have had to buy two. :grin:

Also, it looks like lots of 4s batteries are on sale too, but there's too many to list.

I'm not really sure how hobby king works ... East coast I got it for the $48...but west coast and international is $80.... It's like you have three websites to check...and you can't mix the regions you buy from...they need to be separate orders

Yeah, its a little confusing, since each order is from one of their warehouses, and sales are warehouse specific most times. I usually get a list of items that I want and try to order as much from one warehouse at once, to justify shipping costs. This is part of why I made this thread, cause if I look only at the closest USA West warehouse to me, I could easily miss out on deals from the other warehouses. More eyes on HK, the better.

Is that 149kv usually used in dual set ups or single? Is it too long to use for dual?

Lol. Sure sounds like it, huh. More like I'm getting worked by Hobby King, and feeling powerless to give them all my money.
I'm just a sucker for a great deal.

There's no way you'd be to fit it as a traditional dual rear. Only dd. Maybe one of the mounts reversed like I'm doing on my build.
```

## \#28 Posted by: Mobutusan Posted at: 2016-04-19T22:28:32.371Z Reads: 89

Or you could possibly go staggered dual rear.

I was thinking about putting this motor on my single drive board running 10s.. but dropping from the current 213kv to 149 kv drops a clean 10 mph off the top speed. no thanks... :(

What does 149kv feel like? that seems low, even for 12S. At least on a street rig anyway.

I don't know first hand how it feels, but according to the calculator, it should be good for at least 21-25mph with 16/36 gearing, depending on if you go with 83, 90 or 97mm wheels. Not gonna break any speed records with that setup, but might fit the bill for some folks. Could always gear up a bit or do the uneven dual with a higher kv motor too, no?

A 20/36 setup on 97mm wheels will get up to 30+mph, theoretically.

I know how I ride and stay in the 15-18 mph range with rare occasions I go above 20mph ... I even checked last night ... I will be appreciating more torque that I have been missing coming out of turns

This might be a good setup then for heavier people on thicker decks. 

They would also be able to accelerate up completely vertical inclines, which would be handy in an escape sequence where you need to skate up the side of a building to get away from a mutant with super powers.

This feiyu is only 2 axis, as opposed to the 3 axis variant which provides more range of stabilization

That gimbal is only 2 axis.....$100 is pricy when you figure the gimbal costs $30 online....little time and half the price you could build something better I think,
