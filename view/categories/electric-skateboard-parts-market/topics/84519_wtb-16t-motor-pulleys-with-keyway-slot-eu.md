Looking to buy 2x 16t motor pulleys with keyway and 8mm bore. 
Preferable steel (tb pulleys) and in the EU.

I have a pair of 18T from eskating that i can trade is there is interest for those.

The link from @Quiles  is the best you can get.
They will fit your needs, just choose the parameters you want to have.
Why they shouldn’t fit?
They even steel pulleys...and the price is not bad too.

But if you prefer to pay more for the same product and get it from an esk8 vendor, than have a look here:

I would go for eskating if they had keyway. 
Did you order from beltingonline.com?

Does anyone know what keyway size to get? I belive the most common is 3mm?

unfortunately shipping to sweden is very expensive from beltingonline.
35£ and then pulleys are 24£.

So i will keep looking around :)
