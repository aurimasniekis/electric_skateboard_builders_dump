Hey Jacob,

On the product description, it says "15 deg hill climbing". Do you mean 15% grade, or actually 15 degrees (28~% grade)?

Because I was calculating pricing on my shipping account, but I have not used it in a while and they have put my pricing up.

I have tested them on a hill that is 28deg as in angle.

But I put 15deg on the website to talk down the product. Because if some one is 150kg and tries to climb a 28deg hill I don't think it will.

@jacobbloy might as well be coming to your house, kicking yo damn door in and showering you with hub motors.
these are the real deal! get on it.

and just incase you don't believe the hype.
I cracked an easy 24.1km/h (25 really, I had to brake for a car) on a single one of these with 6S on a hobbyking Xcar ESC

Hey Jacob,
Are these hub motors able to be swapped out with a regular wheel? So say if I decide to ride on a single hub motor (when on flat terrains) and three regular 83mm Kegel wheels, would that be possible? 
Thanks,
```

thanks for the response. Does this mean that the hub motors would also be able to swap with other trucks without any modifications (since I don't have access to heavy machinery)? I've read on the reviews and in one of the posts, some heavy modification/drilling of the truck is required in order to fit the hub motors.

Damn, that's a shame :/ I was hoping to get a board together to ride over the summer, July is quite late for me. Motors look lovely though :)

Got some samples from lebeda today for the exact design I will be using for the front wheel, they are so sexy and nice! Sadly I don't know if I can share photos ATM but it's gonna cost over 10k so I don't think it's on the cards for some time!

Couldnt resist these, so I just placed an order :grinning: Really looking forward for the comparison between these and the Carvons :sunglasses:

Question to you @jacobbloy , is it possible to get the VESC-android app without buying your Beta program?

Ordered last night!  Thanks for posting the video Low Guido.  Jacob, do you recommend a battery size to optimize the dual motor configuration?

i still am a fan of 6s as i do not generally ride faster then 25km/h because that is a good speed for my bad knees if i have to bail but 10s is great.

Still not sold on the hub motors for my self. how would the dual set up on 12S compare to my 6374 149kv 16:36 gearing 12S set up?

Also, i dont want to do a lot of work on the hub motors, if I buy the dual set up, will it be just screw on the hardware to the trucks and board resulting in plug and play, or will i have to put lock tight or epoxy on the hub motors?

just bought a set earlier today! can't wait to see how it runs! Also Jacob, would it be possible to throw in the 83mm Orangatang Kegel for the front wheels instead of other brands? I especially like the look and reliability of Orangatang wheels. Thanks Jacob!

If you not convinced then wait for more reviews after this batch ships, but it will all come pre assembled on the trucks just put the base plate on then plug the phase wires in!

4mm but depending on your deck/ build might need to extend the phase wires so it doesn't batter a great deal
