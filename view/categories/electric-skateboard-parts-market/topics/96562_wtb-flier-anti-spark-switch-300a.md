They are just and ordinary antispark switch capable of about 80a continuous. You can pick one up from almost any brand.

This one is good mate? https://buildkitboards.com/collections/batteries/products/100a-anti-spark-switch?variant=12590976598110

I was told the Flier one is premium, it will be used with 12S6P, 6380 motors.

Its the same thing more or less. They all are massively overpriced. Its just several fets with a precharging resistor to prevent lock up. I prefer a xt90 loopkey. Every antispark i have used has failed at some point. Ive used about a dozen different ones

I would love to use a loop key, however its just not aesthetically pleasing.... if there was a way to make it look nice would love to.

After seeing all the nice builds on the Lacroix DIY threads using switches, a loopkey just does not feel right :)
