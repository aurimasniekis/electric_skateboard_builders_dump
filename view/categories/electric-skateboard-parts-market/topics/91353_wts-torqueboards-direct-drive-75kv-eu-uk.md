As the title suggests, I have a brand new set of TB-DD 75kv that I ordered in December, they've been opened to check they are intact and looked at for about 30 seconds and they are back in the box.

This is the BACK TRUCK only. I do not have the front truck, I did not purchase one from TB. I intended to run a Surfrodz RKP up front. I was given a $100 discount on the DD because of this and will pass that on.

I paid Â£465 including delivery, import taxes and fees.

Looking for Â£425 excluding delivery. If you want some of these beasts immediately and want to skip import fees this is your chance. I will send them next day.

Bubble wrap is free

I can't deal with the spell checker. It's an impossible choice for me, hear me out.

I grew up with color

I've since come to the light and know its spelled colour correctly

Now this website is questioning my faith

HI! May ask you a fovour? Maybe you have already given a try but would be possible for you to try to swap the hanger of the TB DD with caliber 2 hanger or paris. Of course in case you have them. I would need to know if the DD base plate is still caliber2 based. 
Thank you if you can make it happen! :grin:

I really want to help you with this Alessio, I even have a fresh caliber truck here but I just don't want to mess around with the DD at all, I'd like to send it to the new owner exactly as it came from the factory. Its only spent about 20 seconds out of it's box!

Hope you understand. @torqueboards Dexter can you help here? Does this badboy fit on a caliber 2 baseplate?

Hi man sure no problem. I know they are new. I just thought that unscrew the kingpin won't affect it. Anyhow thank you very much. No problem really!

Tried it, won't fit. The TB baseplate kingpin position is taller.

Thanks man! That's a pity so many different base plates. We should keep a standard one for future customisations. Thank you!
