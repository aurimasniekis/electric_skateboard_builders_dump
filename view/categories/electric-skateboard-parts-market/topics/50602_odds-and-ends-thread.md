Thanks to @b264 for the idea, so now we have a thread to buy and sell all of your odds and ends that you donâ€™t need.

I am actually looking for an xt90 antispark connector if anyone has spares let me know.

What do you need? Post it here

I have lots of spare odds and ends laying around. I really don't know where to start.
I have a bunch of EC5 connectors that I bought and never used.

I could use some 20 gauge wire (black and red) and 10 or 8 gauge wire, same :slight_smile:

I have a bunch of extra xt90s if anyone needs.
