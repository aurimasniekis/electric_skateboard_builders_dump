(2) 6354 230kV motors - bought these from eskating.eu about (2) months back

PRICE: $88 for both shipped (2-day USPS priority mail)

REASON FOR SALE: Motors work like brand new, but i needed to buy some lower kV motors (lower top speed, higher torque)

INFO: I fired these up with dual vesc6 setup with 60A limit with a 12s4p 44V battery pack and EPRM hit a max of 53,000 so well below the 60k soft limit and 100k hard limit of the vesc's.

I saw these a while ago but figured it would be nice to let someone else have a crack at firsts.
