I haven't posted them yet. I need to take a picture of myself wearing one so you can see how beautiful i really am. And also the hoodies. I only have a few of them but if they all go i'll get more and try to get a better price on them so i can pass on the the savings. Right now i'm going to have to list them for $55 but i think i can do better than that if i do some more volume. 

I was up till 2 this morning finishing up a customer build, getting it shipped, and catching up on emails.
