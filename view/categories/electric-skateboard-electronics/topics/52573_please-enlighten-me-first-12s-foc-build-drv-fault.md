Hey Guys,

Spent a few days aligning parts, soldering and setting up the two FocBoxes on this dual 6374 build. Everything seems to run fine, both motors turned on the bench sensors detected fine blah blah blah

I screwed on the enclosure/cover, turn it on and pressed the throttle a little, one motor turned and the other didnâ€™t ðŸ˜”. Opened everything up and saw the dread red led. Plugged it into the PC and this is the fault I see...

Can you tell what I did wrong by these images?![image|375x500](upload://aXLegmzqkQ569mibrmTFySHBR6c.jpeg)![image|374x500](upload://wd7BgTXEhZPmnby9NGeZIhoHIgq.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://gzxjrxc5w3cWmTWtAFrDo7XIR3p.jpeg)

You detected in FOC independently for both? 

At any time did any of the phase wires touch while powered on...

Never spin it up on the bench. Number one reason why people fry drv's. Ooh and bad solder jobs. 
Did you manage to ride it?

There is no load while bench testing. This means you can go over the erpm limit very quickly if there is one. That and all sorts of other things. 

It won't hurt just spinning the motor a little bit but most of us go full throttle right then and there. That's where the error lies.

How about my numbers, would any of that be my issue?

@Deckoz each was detected independently. I have a receiver for each focbox.

@RedEagle basic solder jobs on my end would not be bad. I've been soldering stuff since I was like 4 since my dad was a electrical engineer. Can't do most of what he can, but this I can do. as for spin up on bench. I only did slow spins to check direction, not really full throttle or anything. I never stepped on it since I'm still waiting for belts and one of the motor pulleys.

@scepterr Can you send me back the two FocBoxes when you get a chance. Might need it now

Are you 100% sure you loaded the correct FW on there? Everything you have posted on there looks fine to me. I know on the newer VESC Tools, it can be easy to pick the wrong one from the list they give you

''Its carvon speed drive I full throttle it all the time when I was fixing it without load they donâ€™t pass the erpm limit . never had issues''

Well, if your erpm is under 60k, solder job's good. you're using reliable psu/battery then it all comes down to the esc. If you're lucky you'll get one of the good batch.

For example I've had only one maytech vesc fail on me and it was my fault. Never used any other brand.

How long are your main battery wires? I would also check which rail is shorted.

I generally stay at stock firmware I think its 2.14 or 2.17 never had issues if it ain't broke don't fix It lol.

The biggest thing with the new FW is that the VESC Tool UI is very different from the old BLDC Tool. Both of them work fine and some functions are more optimized on the new FWs, but if you don't take the time to familiarize yourself with the software... you're gonna have a bad time

why go full throttle(with arrow keys), just put it on like 5k rpm and see if it spins nicely

No, I'm saying go ackimaniacs 2.54. It's fool proof. I've yet to get the ride quality on any other firmware/version.

I've probably ridden the 10s FocBox in FOC for maybe 150 miles with no issues except the the initial two DRV errors, same one failed twice, I think it was a bad batch. but no issue with that one some far. I was thinking this was a 12s problem.

@mmaner ahhh. I used ackmaniac 3.10, just downloaded 2.54. I'll try that

Still scared of doing it haha. Not saying it won't work but I've seen this happen often enough to keep me spooked I know @Deckoz runs them at 13s and it's fine for him. 

Maybe once my Raptor comes in this week I'll mess with my board I don't want to be rideless if my focbox blow up.

While this is true... I typically do my detections at 4s or a lower voltage, as detections can be...well.. interesting.  Not necessary by any means.. but just something I do...

![image|374x500](upload://iId7JeVAmxKbCjqrUWmMWm2KWNw.jpeg)Visually, does anything stand out? Iâ€™m not seeing anything. 

I reflashed the FW, rebooted and when I tried to detect motor, the motor made a slight click noise and I see the red led

Could be but they aren't using water base flux, so it should not affect any of the electronic.

@Mikenopolis
Can you tell me if your FOCBOX constantly flashing fault lights or only flashes at initial startup and then stay at blue or blue & green?
Also, on which firmware you are currently at?
Have you tried using BLDC tool to check? Instead of VESC tool?
```

No it flashed when I throttled just a tiny bit. First fault with ackmaniac. I reflashed the firmware back to original. Attempted to start over and detect motor and it flashed red

hmmm I donâ€™t think so. I used the old bldc tool, the one vesc tool from vedder, and ackmaniac which everyone said was superior. Iâ€™m think it was either the 12s or FOC that caused the fault.
