So when I fully break the VESC kinda loosed brake power towards the end of the stop but never maker it to 0 or when going from forwards backwards it always jitters in my dual sensored hub motor setup...

Is there a way to configure it so it won't do that?

You won't get full stop with electronic brakes. You need physical brakes if you want dead stop.

My boards come to a complete stop. 
After I step off that is.

Hmmm My board always does a complete stop with proper amount of space for what ever speed im going. Ive even make a complete stop going down a bridge, it only does a complete stop for a moment though then it starts to roll slowly i just jump off at or close to that moment.

Like @Jinra said you won't come to a complete stop  with HUB MOTORS with a geared setup yeah you probably will but with hubs you usually just need to put your foot down to completely stop, which I don't really care about at all lol.
