I just had 7 VESC's repaired by LP Electronic in Germany for an average of 45 euros each with postage and packaging and detailed reports of all the parts replaced. The service was great and they clearly know their way around a VESC. I had multiple blown DRV chips, sm32 chips, water damage and random blown capacitors in the mix. All came back perfect with detailed reports on each VESC within a fortnight. 

 I'd email Lucas at service@lp-electronic.com if you need one fixed. 

 Here is the invoice I got Including the pricing of all the replacement parts and service costs for reference.
