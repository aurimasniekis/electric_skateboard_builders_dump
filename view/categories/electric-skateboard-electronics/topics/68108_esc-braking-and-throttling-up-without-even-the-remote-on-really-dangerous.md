# ESC braking and throttling up without even the remote on, really dangerous

As much as I love the electronic speed controllers, my experience on an electric long board is slowly becoming a mental game of what will go wrong and when... This is the second ESC that obviously has some serious problem.  Sometimes when setting up the remote the throttle/brake bar in ESC is going crazy from one side to the other, it takes several apply, apply, apply and sometimes it goes to normal, sometimes it stays the same, sometimes it jumps to the conclusion that my center of throttle is at 80%... Also even with control on OFF the motor will spin when I pres the throttle.  I first thought it is the remote, I have the alien power systems remote... SO I bought a new RC remote, went fine for two days and today it started to happen again. Sporadic throttle where it keeps cutting out (just the throttle not the esc) and sometimes throws a little or more braking into it... So it goes throttle cut out, throttle kicks back in, brakes, speeds up... I brake, the ESC cuts off for more than 500 ms which is my settings for reboot. ... Then it's working for a few minutes and then again... It always happens in slow speeds or when just freewheeling without using the remote or slowly speeding up from a slow speed... I am not getting these cheaper ESCs anymore, I ride sometimes 50 km/h and a spontaneous brake or anything will cost me my health or my life. I need something reliable... I have ordered focbox and might Trampa;s VESC and I hope my concerns will go away...  My question is, how reliable are ESCs and which are those real VESCS ?  (I weight 54 kg and have been riding only on superb bike paths 90 percent of the time... It's not like I am destroying the stuff...  I don't mind something braking from time to time, that's just a pain in the ass... But things like throttling up and braking as a fault that is certain death

sounds like a remote problem. the chances that 2 different vesc behave in the same erroneous way is unlikely. You should have no problems setting up your remote. Maybe the transmitter is broken or wrongly connected, wrong channel ect ect.

That's what I thought and that's why I bought a new rc remote... does the  same thing... When I turn the remote off the motor keeps jittering

My first ESC wouldn't go through motor setup and it kept turning on only sometimes, the second one does this...  I have to say they were not new, about one year old... I am just worried about these problems happening more than once in a life time...

I mean if it was the remote it wouldn't make the ESC cut off... And two remotes in a row...

A VESC is very reliable! Posts like yours shine a bad light on the VESC-Project and the VESC hardware! You are referring to a third party piece of hardware as a VESC. It is no VESC, it's a whatever ESC. You should call your hardware by it's bloody name, so that others have a chance to identify the manufacturer. 
Obviously it's a cheap derivate you are running, not a VESC.

yes VESC is reliable :smiley:, i dont think @Pantata intentionally knew or clarified brand. I started with flier esc thinking it was vesc forever.. but i get your frustration. :sweat_smile: so many speed controllers now its crazy

Sensor / sensorless motors? Did you run detection?
I've haf my.motos moved when remote is off. That was because bad sensor wires.

I am doing that right now... I know it'a guessing issue.. :) That diyelectricboards ESC is cheap in comparison with focbox or VESC by Trampa... Nevermind me, shouldn't have never trust my life with those... Thanks for the info guys, only Vesc now...

These are clones or derivate products. They are compatible with VESC-Tool. 
How well they are built, depends on the manufacturer, and the customer has to judge quality by feedback from other customers experience. This is why it's good that everyone has to use the on brand to market their products. Otherwise poor quality output from xyz impacts the VESC project in a negative way. It's not only the Hardware... Clone Software also can't use the VESC brand for given reason.

There are a decent amount of quality clones available, focbox being one. Plenty of people have used it with great success. Then there are reliable and cheap vesc6 derivatives (Escape being one).

"real", yah..well, Trampa obtained the rights to sell vesc hardware. It does not make the others fake. That's in the end marketing, etc.

That Said, the diyeboard vesc derivative is known to be one of the worst.

I know Trampa's Vesc and Enetion's focbox is something I would trust, you say also escape, don't know that one... will have a look... There is no reason trying to save money on something that has your life in it's hands... Will never do the mistake again... Though I bought a used board that already came with the Torque escs..

Same here. I just completed a 25 km trip with super steep off-road hill climbs, loose sand, rocks etc. on a couple of motors and focboxes that ran 3000 km already. Mountain board abuse is about the worst you can have for electronics. I trust the focboxes.

Yes, we sell the official hardware. In consequence we try to offer the highest quality possible, not compromising on design, parts and QC. We will not judge what others offer. Their customers will do that. I hope that more people will realize that saving 100 bucks is not worth it if the part is safety relevant. And I hope that more manufacturers will stop chasing the $ by cutting back quality, trying to offer the most price driven product. I think your statement is quite true.

I agree Ted, but when you have the option of buying an ESC for 90 euros vs VESC for 300 euros as a person that does not see inside of how the other ESCs are made, usually no one would debate, the one for 90 euros is enough... That is until the ESC sends you to the hospital and you realize why you should pay premium (or just keeps braking every 2 weeks...) Now I know...

@trampa he clearly states the term esc when talking about the problem not vesc.  Its even in the title.

I'm not entirely sure this will be helpful, but I found that increasing my deadband from .15 to .2 eliminated any issues with the motors turning while I wasn't pushing the throttle.

Ok, I wanna clarify what had happened. I know now. I don't wanna bash Torque ESC because the first one was acting weird already when I bought it (it was used) and my problem with crazy speed ups and braking was my receiver to ESC wire shorting out. SHoot me on the spot... That guy I bought it from soldered some extension to it and the wires were naked and were touching from time to time... Such a simple and stupid thing not to see as a potential threat...  So keep the wires with heat shrink and don't let receiver wires keep shorting out... I get it... Thank for the input guys... I have ridden since then several hundreds of km with no problems running that second Torque ESc with one motor.

no problem, like i said, that behaviour is almost 100% a case of receiver/remote problems.
