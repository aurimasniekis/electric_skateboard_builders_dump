Hey guys so I recently had a bad battery or so I thought. Got a new one in the mail and decided to rip this one apart and take a look on the inside. My voltage was 23v at the connector but after tearing it open Iâ€™m getting 38v from battery pack to battery pack which leads me to believe the bms is bad and I might be able to save this battery and either sell it to someone or keep it as a backup. If anyone can help me locate a bms to use and how to set it up Iâ€™d appreciate it!

They have multiple amp discharge options if you choose not to bypass the discharge functions
