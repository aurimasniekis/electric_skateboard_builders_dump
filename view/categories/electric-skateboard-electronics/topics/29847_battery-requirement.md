Need advice for my esk8. I have a 5065 270kv 1600w. If i divide 1600w/22V (6s) i get 72A.

Do i need a lipo or 18650 pack that handles 72A? First i have thoughts about building my own 18650 pack with 6s4p but i only can draw 40A~50A safe. 

I also have car lipos home 2s 5000mah 20~30C if i make them 6s 5000mah 20C will that be enough?

What would be a fitting lipo to 2engine as above?

Best regards
Jimmy

why would you say a 6s4p can give you max 60A ? it depends on the batteries. You could get away even with 30Q or 25R. 

For lipo depends how many in paralel you have. Lipos can deliver much more amps so the 20-30 would be enough but id still use something like 6s3p at least.. or 6s4p.

LG HG2's produce 20A, put four of those in parallel (6s4p) and you've got yourself 80A...

So do you have 1 motor or 2 ?

From experience.. unless you got hills.. you might as well not need more than ~900W of power anyways. 

It is good that your battery can output what motor might need at max amps but otherwise it would run also with weaker battery, you just wouldnt have all the power you could have out of your system.

As far as I know people have used multistars before, they are a bit bulky to use but are okay unless you load them really hard, as I think some people have complained about their performance while others have had everything all right with them.

So for 'power' lipo will be better, if you go with what rating says: 12ah X 10C = 120Amps, some say better take half of that, so you should still be good for 60Amps at least.

If you go with li-ion and need to power 2 motors, I think at least 1000W would be needed (500w per motor, with 700W more optimal)..

So, if your li-ion pack could output at least 1400w, I think you would still enjoy the board unless you are speed demon or something, depends on application.

2 motor's working on 6S, I should go for lipo but that's my opinion.
