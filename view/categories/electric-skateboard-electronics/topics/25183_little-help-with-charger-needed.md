I have four turnigy 3s 5000mah lipo battery and iMax B6AC version 2 charger, how can I safely charge those batteries with this charger? (I also have Multi port parallel adapter 40A for XT60 with XH balance from APS but I can't use it with iMax charger because balance cables from adapter are for 8s and iMax can take upto 6s) :( help, I don't want to spend too much money on another charger

Just charge your packs one at a time. That's the best way.
Or install a bms and use a simple charger

You can get a cable splitter that uses two 3s balance leads to one 6s lead and plug that into the charger.  It's what I do currently. 

Buy one of these leads and you can charge two sets of batteries to get yourself going. 

Alternatively you can grab a 12s BMS and use a 50.4v laptop charger.  Keep in mind you'll still need your balance charger to put batteries in storage and/or check the balance and internal resistance of your cells every once in a while.

Random question along the charger line...  I am waiting for my charger to come in the mail (this [charger](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Lithium-Ion-Battery-Charger-Li-ion-LiPo-10S-42V-2A-for-36V-37V-Wall-Socket-AC-DC-/321555510511)) , pretty common charger that i've seen all over the forums...

My question is, is there a converter for the plug to an XT60 connector? [XT-60 connector](https://www.amazon.com/Jrelecs-Connectors-Plugs-Female-Battery/dp/B00ZF81TFC/ref=sr_1_25?ie=UTF8&qid=1497288374&sr=8-25-spons&keywords=xt60+converter&psc=1)

Cheers!

These are the best imo and they have a built in anti-spark E-switch

quick question @Namasaki, what did you set your overcharge voltage detection to? I asked for 4.25v for mine since the balance voltage starts at 4.2v

ah cool, yes they said they had a bunch of 4.28v available, but i specified 4.25v so they said they have to make them. Taking forever to come...
