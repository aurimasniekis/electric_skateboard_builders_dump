Dual ESCapes.

I know it needs to go to the PPM ports but not sure how to do this

If that’s the question then you need either a canbus connector or ppm splitter. I’m sure someone had one of this cables on the forum they would sell to u. Also I think it’s more safe to use a ppm splitter rather than canbus

The housing on the ESCape connectors is JST PH series.
Connector https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/jst-sales-america-inc/PHR-3/455-1126-ND/527357
Pins for connector: https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/jst-sales-america-inc/SPH-001T-P0.5L/455-2147-1-ND/1634655

For the receiver, find one of this 3 pin connectors.

Put it in the freebies wanted section.
I bet @mmaner has one because he has literally everything  and he’s very generous.

My soldering iron is broken, or I'd make you one. I can mail you the correct ends if you can do the soldering.

Is JST micro the same thing as JST PH? I need to connect ESCape to mini remote receiver and this is only thing that I found.

No, the jst part looks different eg. smaller then regular JST-PH. On my ESCapes i cut a normal 6 pin JST-PH in half and soldered it on the other end of the plug which goes into the reciever.
