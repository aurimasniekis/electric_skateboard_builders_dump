Hey guys, so you may have seen my build going on...at a snails pace 

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-heavyweight-custom-deck-roja-hybrid-trucks-sk3-6374-149kv-custom-hub-motors-10s3p-vesc/103/42

A few changes as far as direction have been made. Considering what I will be using this set-up for, have decided to go the all wheel drive route, what with bigger wheels and the fact that I will be towing a trailer often think that dual hubmotors will not be enough. Have ordered 4 of jacob bloys 63mm hub motors with 107mm thane that we made a mould for a while back, which should be in sometime January.

So the question is this, **will running longer wires to the motor effect performance, and if so how can I negate this?** From where the vesc's will be mounted and to the furthest truck there will be about 2ft/60cm of wire that will have to be run to power the motors, and just under 1f/30cm to get to the other motors. Which brings up the other question, **will I have to keep the wires to these motors all the same length to keep everything running smooth and balanced?**

Thanks all for any help you can share

From what I've heard the motor wire length doesn't make that big of a difference. Battery to esc wire length however makes a large impact.

This would be good news if what you heard is true, wonder though if you would effect performance/efficiency if; in a hypothetical world, one motor had a wire 10 ft long, and another 1 ft long.

FWIW [Here][1] is some reading material for background information.
There's also plenty of links to resources towards the bottom of the page.

Ya, I once had my esc located at the front of my board with the wires going about 2ft back to the motor: no noticeable performance difference from having 6inches of wire. 

But like @locktight said, I would be more concerned about battery wire length
