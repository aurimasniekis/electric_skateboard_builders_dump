Hi team! I started a thread about suddenly losing a lot of range and a significantly shorter charging time...i wanna open up my battery pack to see if I lost a parallel connection somewhere but Im lacking the know-how and equipment to put it back together if i take it apart. 

The pack is a 18650 30q 10s4p 8x5 cell block, I think we want to test the voltage of each parallel pack and make sure there arent any "quick fix" faults first before deciding to just make a whole new battery.

Thanks guys! I'll definitely travel to you and compensate as well. Im located in Venice area

i assume you have a voltmeter?

and this pack of yours has balance leads, right?

connect pack negative to voltmeter negative.

then measure each balance lead in sequence, jot the voltages down.

then using excel or whatever, subtract successive numbers and that'll give you each P group voltage.

see if you've got large variances, like more than 0.2v.

also, what does 8x5 cell block mean?

I dont have anything besides a soldering iron! 8Ã—5 block means there are 40 cells in a block that is 8 cells wide and 5 cells tall. Theyre not just laid out flat
