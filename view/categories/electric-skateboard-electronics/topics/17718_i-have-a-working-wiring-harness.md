Thanks to the users of this forum I was able to build a working wiring harness that combines 3 - 2S LIPO batteries including a balance plug and anti spark switch. I just finished it and it checked out with my LIPO checker first, and now I am charging as 1 battery to see how long it takes to charge. Here are a couple pics so you can see my progress. Next will be VESC and enclosures to complete my project.
