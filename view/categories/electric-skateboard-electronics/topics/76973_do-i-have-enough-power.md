Hello folks, currently parting out a DIY build. Im utilizing a scooter hub motor and want to know if my power options are enough;

Ill be running a 10s5p pack and an focbox.

I can either go with a 36v 600W motor

or

A larger 36v 1000W motor

Now obviously the bigger one is stronger, but the tradeoff is larger tires and heavier overall. So my question is, do I need to go big or go home???
