Go to console and type 'faults'. You probably blew your DRV and will need to replace it.

In BLDC-Tool go to the terminal tab and sent the command faults. It will tell you the error.

Also when you plug the VESC in, are you clicking the Read Current Settings button in the bottom left?

You have mentioned earlier that you got a DRV error:[quote="Bryantmorris101101, post:12, topic:9484, full:true"]
Fault            : FAULT_CODE_DRV8302
Current          : 0.2

So you will need to replace the DRV8302 chip (It is written on the big chip)! You can replace it yourself, ask a local electrician or maybe someone from this forum can do this.

It needs to be revived with a fresh DRV chip but we do not know why it died so it will likely blow another chip unless you fix the cause of the error.
