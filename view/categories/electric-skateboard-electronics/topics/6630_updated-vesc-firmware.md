I'm unable to find the updated firmware version 2.18 can anyone help me out? I have a hw4.12 VESC. I downloaded the windows BLDC tool from http://vesc.net.au/ but while the bldc tool is for 2.18 the firmware updates are still on 2.15.

Make sure to pick you hardware version correctly otherwise you'll damage your VESC
