Hi @onloop 

just a quick question, I suddenly shorted my vesc, and I noticed that it shorted at the motor connection leads. perhaps the vesc is burnt. Does the motor burnt too? idk haha or anyone might give their opinion? cheers

yes, I think so. Because there is a blue light at the vesc, but i noticed before it is shorted, there was a yellow light which means the vesc receive signals from the receiver.

Ouh I checked the vesc again and there are blue light and yellow light. Now im a bit confused either the motor, the receiver or vesc damaged. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/ffdd56cc07981d323396e1f1fef702556ddac390.JPG" width="375" height="500">
