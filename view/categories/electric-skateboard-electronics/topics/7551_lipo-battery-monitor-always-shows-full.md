I have been having a weird issue with my lipo battery monitor, it reads the battery is 22.1v or so, but the monitor ALWAYS says that it's 100%, I am assuming the monitor thinks the battery is supposed to be 12V?? Can I fix this, or could someone point me to a better one?
Thanks

depends on your reader do you have a button in the back to program it?

Hold the button on the back of the minister BEFORE the board is powered on. It'll redirect you to the voltage options

Then chose your cell count from there
