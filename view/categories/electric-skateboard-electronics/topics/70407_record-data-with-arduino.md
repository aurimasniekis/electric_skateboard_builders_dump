Hi, I am working on a science project. I have some basic electronic knowledge but nothing huge. Does anyone know how to rig an Arduino to Track and generate graphs for: Acceleration, speed, and the deck angle (For recording the turning angles)? 

Thanks!

if you use a metr module you can record everything from a ride. (i think you can do it with an @Ackmaniac module too)
you don't need an arduino for this

What about angle? Does it really record (And graph) acceleration?

it does acceleration but not deck angle. you'd need some sort of gyro to measure that
