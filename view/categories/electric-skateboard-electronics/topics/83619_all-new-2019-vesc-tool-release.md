**The 2019 VESC-Tool is about to arrive!**

For 2019 Benjamin has packed a nice present for the community.
Hopefully next week we will see a release of the Mobile VESC-Tool in the play store.
The new VESC-Tool is super convenient to use and is prepared to work seamless with upcoming hardware releases. Everything is fully automated and in consequence the complete setup is now nailed with 3 to 5 clicks only. Setting up a dual or quad drive takes just as long as setting up a single VESC. 

Next week we will show you something brand new. 
**Visit www.trampaboards.com and don't miss out the release of the new VESC 6 Plus.** 

These are some of the new features you will benefit from:

- Auto motor detection including sensor detection for all VESCs simultaneously.
- Motor detection in FOC open loop
- automatic and accurate current settings for motor and battery (can still be manipulated manually). 
- FW updates to all VESCs in one hit
- Configuration of all VESCs in one hit
- Profiles (top speed, current limits, power limits, brake etc.)
- Profiles changeable while actually riding the board (you can't feel the switching)
- permanent and non permanent profiles 
- profiles are written to all VESCs simultaneously and instantly
- Smooth low speed braking capabilities (braking close to stand still)
- Analogue cockpit (speed, power, rpm, duty cycle, current, battery) 
- Statistics and estimated range (really accurate now)
- Data from all VESCs is now used to calculate the values
- Board can be given a name 
- Communication between remote, phone/tablet and VESCs simultaneously (triangular communication).
- pairing of remote and phone/tablet to VESCs (stops others to interact with your VESC/board).
- new remote features to allow display of values on remote
- The new VESC-Tool is fully prepared to work with the upcoming hardware releases
- The new VESC-Tool will be fully compatible with older hardware like 4.xx
- Support for UAV-CAN (e.g. for multicopters and robots)
- and many more.....

I can add some bling to an Android and lock it down so you can't do anything at all, and then charge more for the shittiness.  Will that do?

Oh, no that won't do because it doesn't come with a side order of "Stifling Innovation and making it more expensive to innovate, directly helping China"

Really liked the new profiles, I’ve never managed to make profiles work using UART, this should make things easier by just sending a command of use X profile forever or until reboot

@trampa do you know if the new global current/energy/etc is done at a VESC level or VESC tool level? In other words, the tool gets values from all the VESCS and sum them or the VESC that have the Bluetooth module does the math and send the global values?

The funny thing is that you're pointing out exactly why it's a non issue, cheap android phones. If apple compatibility is really an issue for anyone I suggest going to walmart and picking up a $30 prepaid android burner phone and use it specifically for programming. Small investment and you can keep your iPhone that way.

Never, ever get a phone from a carrier, under any circumstances.

And yes, you can get a cheap Android for this purpose for [$39.99 with free shipping](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samsung-Galaxy-S2-Smartphone-Android-Touch-Screen-Fast-Free-Shipping/162848690181) and if you actually bought a real phone, you wouldn't even have this problem in the first place.

No I meant for working phones like iPhones. I can run It on my Huawei Mate 20 pro but for the most of the time it’s on the shelf because every time I pick it up it it feels like being at work due to how buggy it is. I spend the days at work coding and sorting out bugs in software and at home I really prefer to use a finished product :)

Yup, I haven't bought a phone from any providers in at least ~ 3 or 4 years. Best thing ever. I don't like monthly payments on phones.

How much do you pay per person per month? If you don't mind. That might factor into the free mobiles. But maybe you are grandfathered into a very good plan. 

We pay $120 for 3 people for text and calls unlimited. And data of 20gb per person with T-mobile.

As far as I know it's all done on the VESC level.  Otherwise the remote would not be able to display the info without the phone running in parallel. Benjamin took his time to think of the best way to implement things without working himself into a corner like other implementations did. 
All together it's 20k+ new lines of code, 8k on the FW side. This is not just a simple tweak to existing FW.  It's a a proper foundation allowing future developments without going forward and backwards all the time.

I would suggest to move Android vs Apple debates into a separate thread.  It's quite boring to have that debate each time VESC-software is debated. This thread is about the 2019 VESC-Tool and new FW. Everyone knows that Apple is not supported for reasons that are in Apple's hands only. If you want to use OS, GPLed Software,  you need a HW platform allowing such software on your device. The Apple terms and conditions are diametrally opposing the GPL license and this fact will not change in any foreseeable future.

Me too, that's why I want real phones that run any software I want.  Phones whose parent company are not pushing innovation into China.  If I care about fashion and being the hippest person on the runway, then of course I'd wear Yeezys and wear an iPhone but if I want a real phone to actually do things with, then I don't buy stuff solely designed to look nice and solely designed to create cults.

Note: my goal is not to defend Apple here. Their opposition to the GPL license is regrettable.

However, you’re so insufferable about your apple hate to the point that you’re calling Apple product users cult members. Take it down a notch dude.

Your opinions of Apple should not be and are not the reason that the vesc tool won't be released on iOS, it’s what @trampa and others have mentioned. Your personal takes on Apple's products are not relevant here, unless you're writing the app of course.

I do make apps, and I totally agree with Benjamin, and I don't feel sorry for the people who overpay for apple stuff then want to complain when they can't run GPL software.

Because giving any money to apple is directly making it more expensive for American/Western software companies to innovate.  Then, ***the Chinese companies can innovate the same new product, but with half as much work*** and cost as their western counterparts.  You're giving them a free pass to be better, bigger, and stronger than everyone else.  Just by buying Apple products.  You're literally hurting yourself and everyone else who isn't in China.  But man, you sure do look cool on the runway.

Good job.

Hi @skatardude10, the new VESC-Tool comes with a low speed braking solution as standard. It is a different solution to the one that has been discussed here on this forum. Someone made a pull request. So Benjamin recently had a look at the suggested implementation but spotted some issues with the code implemetation. 

For the new VESC-Tool  he coded something that works a bit smoother and more reliable for a wide range of different motors. Be surprised!

THX for that. it is always good to send in pull requests. Benjamin knows his code front to back, so no one should be disappointed if such a request might not find it's way into the official code base in the exact same way. Benjamin looks at the code shared via github. Since the software is highly complex and many dependencies exist, he might come up with different code nailing the issue.  He also has a wide range of different motors to test things out. Some solutions work great for certain motors but might cause issues for others. 

This weekend he made fantastic progress with the software, so we are optimistic to have a stable release soon. One thing that he worked on was a pairing feature, allowing to pair a VESC to a device (remote/phone/tablet). This way the VESC will only communicate with paired devices, so that others can't easily connect to your setup and mess around with your settings.

The new FW and software solutions allow to communicate to the phone and remote simultaneously via the same NRF module. This is very convenient and allows some nice extra features to get implemented. One of them is changing profiles on the fly. There are other features that will also benefit from this way to communicate. In the end you want one board mounted NRF module to handle all communication tasks, including the stable remote connection. 

The remote (NRF BLE based) will be paired to the VESC and it will not be possible to use a different remote to control your board. The remote FW could have a secret code unlock feature, sure. It could also be done via the phone ( e.g.making a permanent profile with 0 A motor current that you override with a non permanent profile before you ride). Without your phone and permission, no power....
The new way to communicate to phone and remote simultaneously opens some doors for innovation. 
Benjamin has shown some stuff already, but this is just a glimpse of what is possible.

Purchased, installed, updated to latest firmware on my Focboxes (the Vesc6 on my Trampa are at my other house) through the metr pro module.
Motor detection run real easy and fast, the same with input setup.
The motors were detected at 45A (Maytech 6355) but I increased the value to 60A that I normally run.
Battery values were too high so again I manually reduced them to 40A and -10A (dual escs).

The bad:
The update "broke" the metr.at app and only one motor shows. I hope @rpasichnyk will find a solution soon.
I saw this in the changelog: prefer cogging over logging the brakes.
I am not sure I will like that since I already get some cogging while braking on this board (the other is smooth as butter). We will see.

```
The battery values can be set manually during setup. 
Performances wise the battery value is not so important, as long as it matches the motor values or is set higher.
If you use powerful motors, you really want a battery that can deliver an adequate amount of Amps! However, if your battery is the weakest part of your system, you can limit the Amp flow to an acceptable value for the battery. During setup you can enable the custom values box for advanced settings, allowing you to limit the battery values. 
Vesc-Tool can find out max values for the motor, it knows the capacity of your battery, but it can't know what kind of battery you are using, so you might want to fire in values that work best for the cells that you use. Your motors can drain approx 70A each, so 140A would flow from the battery at full duty cycle. With 40A battery max per motor, your system starts to cut back power at around 56% duty cycle. The downside of such setups is a non linear response to the throttle. You will experience a lot of punch till 50%duty cycle and then there is a steep drop in power. If you want a linear response to the throttle you should limit the motor values to match the capabilities of the battery.

BLDC detection is possible. In the VESC-Tool App you can go to the Motor config tab and hit the three little buttons bottom of the page. In the desktop Vesc-Tool you can use the menu on the left to find the BLDC motor configuration. 

The VESC-Tool App allows you to connect to each VESC in an array, so you can connect to the Master first and then connect to the slave. Can forward connection can be found on connection page, below the wizards. The desktop version also features can forward.

@b264 I prefer CAN over split PPM because of traction control. Once I am satisfied with my setup, I am going to remove all connectors and directly solder and conformal coat the whole thing. Can't get any more reliable than that.

I did the firmware upgrade over bluetooth on both escs.
However, just in case what you describe happened, I did the slave vesc first and then the master.

That is the downside of 3rd party apps and forks. Each time Benjamin pushes a major update, there is a lot of work to be done on the 3rd party side. This is unavoidable and the nature of a new release.
If those Apps are closed source, the required code can't be simply integrated, since that would make the closed source APP open source via the GPL license. If you want to make something closed source that interacts with OS-software you have to be quite careful not to use the OS-code in your software solution. I'm not a software expert, but I can imagine that for some stuff it is gets hard at a certain stage.  

Benjamin Vedder  just dropped 20K+ lines of new code and that took him months to code. 
The new App will get frequent updates and that means that 3rd parties will need to invest even more time into updates, while the available features will get more similar. 

I think VESC-Tool mobile is a big step forward, allowing to configure things with ease and get RT-data and have pairing to your device and have easy parallel FW updates, profiles etc.

You are totally wrong. There is no downside of 3rd party apps at all.

The problem is that Benjamin doesn't care about backwards compabitility. This already happened multiple times. I remember once all command codes were incremented by one, just because Benjamin decided to insert one command code in the beginning. **Read** motor configuration command turned into **write** motor configuration and resulted in many VESCs bricked. This could have been easily avoided just by adding the new command code in the end and keeping backwards compatibility. I talked to Benjamin specifically about this issue and he told me he doesn't care much about it. Which is totally fine. He is a one man army does it the way he likes it.

But yeah @taz you were brave to even try 3rd party apps. What are the odds that `COMM_GET_VALUES` command turned into `COMM_SET_DUTY`? Pretty high since they are so close ;)

    // Communication commands
    typedef enum {
      COMM_FW_VERSION = 0,
      COMM_JUMP_TO_BOOTLOADER,
      COMM_ERASE_NEW_APP,
      COMM_WRITE_NEW_APP_DATA,
      COMM_GET_VALUES,
      COMM_SET_DUTY,

I second @rpasichnyk.
I asked Benjamin at the beginning of VESC-Tool project about the operture of this project to other contributors.
Got the answer that you'll write an ethos page for guiding contributors, blablabla.

But, afterall, everything's in Ben's hands.
For instance, I wrote a custom FW with mode (or profiles) months ago, but couldn't push anything since Benjamin told (in november) that he's completely rewriting the FW on his own.
Got no answer about the release date, nor any kind of info. Just gave up my custom FW.
THAT kills contribution. Really.

I love this project but did my mourning about seeing it as a real OS project (funny that you took the Firefox example for justifying TM. This project has 6,5k contributors).
Today we have a paid app and software/firmware without sources (temporary I hope).

About third party stuffs, thanks to them we have some fixes and features added to the official firmware.
Telemetry, Modes, PPM center pulsewidth, easy dual setup FW update...
They push the game further instead of braking it as you think.

Sorry, you got me wrong. It's just that a major update comes with plenty of new code and the nature of such a release is that it creates work for others. Benjamin tries his best to come up with solutions that are future proof and form a foundation to build upon. It is a complex software. You can nail a problem in many ways and some ways are better than others, not working yourself into a corner. 
If you plan a major update with all those new features it requires to restructure things.

All I can tell you is that Benjamin takes his time and sketches things up before starting to code to avoid complications and to avoid working things into corner. He always does things for a reason and publishes the code, so everyone can have a look and straighten things out, which is a fair move.
This is a major update and many things have changed quite a lot, so other Apps will have to adopt to the changes and it will take some time. Benjamin doesn't do such things to create incompatibilities on purpose. It is simply the nature of a major update that things change. Moving forward means changing code base and Benjamin does things the way he thinks it is best. 
Personally I think he did a fantastic job and the App and VESC-Tool is on a different level now. 
I'm also pretty sure that @rpasichnyk will find a way to adopt to the new tool and make his App compatible.

No doubt about Ben's wish to have the better app and FW.
However, it's quite difficult to have a general point of view and understand the needs of most users when you work alone.
Stuffs that Ben may consider as minor changes could have a deep impact on our work.
This is what @rpasichnyk tried to explain.
And I experienced the same.
Few words exchanged with Ben could have avoid tons of work/customer support for us, 3rd party devs.

This is pretty scary. All of the rest of the smartphone wars and licensing bullshit has nothing on this.

The whole point of open source is the ability to build off other peoples contributions and build something that is greater than the sum of its parts. I'm not worried that when I update Firefox it's going to cause a kernel panic next time I boot. On a skateboard traveling at 25mph, the equivalent of a kernel panic is street face with a side of hospital. If @rpasichnyk is correct, and I believe he is given the current state of my board, this is physically dangerous.  

Yesterday, I downloaded the new vesc tool for windows and updated my board's firmware using the TCP bridge feature in the Metr.at app. The firmware update went fine, and I was able to configure it using the new motor wizard. It appeared to be functioning fine on the test bench, so I took it out for a ride. Everything was fine on that ride, but it seemed that the speed limit I had set previously using the Metr.at app has stuck around. So I opened up the app and changed modes. Then the motor wouldn't start when I gave it throttle.

I don't feel like anything in the previous paragraph is wildly irresponsible or obviously dangerous. And yet, it caused my board to be suddenly non-operational.

I am extremely glad that whatever setting Benjamin changed that broke compatibility with the Metr.at app, didn't cause my board to suddenly accelerate or cause my brakes to not work because I probably would have been severely injured. 

Prior to reading this thread, It hadn't occurred to me that someone would be so wildly reckless as to release a new patch that fundamentally changes the way other devices/services interact with something so crucial to the safe operation of a motor vehicle.

I'm pretty pissed off right now, but I really feel like never riding my board again and selling it for parts.

I recently got the Metr.at module and it's awesome. However, the fact you can use it to configure critical VESC settings makes me feel rather anxious. Now, if it changes the settings without first checking that the VESC is running a compatible FW version, that's pretty bad. Doing such checks should be mandatory for all 3rd party apps that change the VESC config.

Vesc-Tool has such a feature built in since the day one. It checks the FW version and refuses access to settings if the FW is not compatible. You need to update if your FW is outdated or incompatible. This way there is always a match between config software and and FW.

If Benjamin (or this case Trampa since they’re handle things when Ben is busy) doesn’t give a heads up to these updates then it’s also on him. The VESC is an esc with multiple applications. These multiple applications will of course have multiple third party applications supporting them, Benjamin knows this too, it’s evident when he wrote an entire blogs on [Writing Custom Applications for the VESC](http://vedder.se/2015/08/vesc-writing-custom-applications/) and [How to communicate the the VESC over UART](http://vedder.se/2015/10/communicating-with-the-vesc-using-uart/) 

Not caring about backwards compatibility and failing to give a heads up notice that he would be breaking is very irresponsible (Enertion is guilty of this too but they get a slight pass since the FW is for the Raptor 2 first , and DIY second , but even then a notice to application developers should have be sent ahead of time allowing them to make the proper changes needed). I too became a victim of this when I updated my focboxes and used the METR app to change some settings. 

@rpasichnyk I think for the future the METR home page and purchase should have a noticeable indicator that indicates what FW the module is compatibility with and not with.

One example is when someone buys new focboxes or Vesc and now needs to use the VESC Tool to update it. Which is most if not all of the time if you’re not going to use Ackmanaic or have a Raptor 2. I don’t have the VESC-Tool readily with me , but if it doesn’t allow for a specific FW to be updated to or does it update to the latest one? If the latter :

That’s an incredibly shitty cop out considering that changes Vedder made to past firmwares was directly responsible for bricking VESCs as evidenced by this thread.

I’m familiar with software and hardware dependency. I have a reasonable expectation that people who develop the upstream versions not break backwards compatibility for shits and giggles.

This behavior is more like an over the top Apple parody than any open source project I have encountered. 

You have to use iTool on your iVesc in order to not brick it. Oh, you bought a whole bunch of expensive accessories for your iUart port? That’s unfortunate, because we removed the iUart port from this years model and switched to iNrf. It took a lot of courage, but we think it’s for the best.

 Not when you use vedde's firmware with the vesc_tool. The tool aready knows whether the firmware is compatible with tool or not. That hasn't bricked any VESCs. Please understand the issue. The issue is 3rd party incompatibility breaking VESCs. It's on them, not Vedder.

But in the case of the bricked Focbox , there was absolutely a way to maintain backwards compatibility and maybe avoid the issue, but because Ben didn’t care about it, many VESC based esc were potentially bricked. In an Open Source Project there has to be  some responsibility to account for third party applications. Especially when that open source project has many limitations that these third party applications cover. One can argue that if METR didn’t cover the IPhone configuration market, many more than already has would’ve moved over to Acks Firmware and supported that over Bens.

But windows as a reputable company would give applications time to play around with windows 10. If they’re about to do something that they know will affect their application system they will let developers know. It’s then up to the developers to get their applications done in time to support these new changes. This is not what Ben and Trampa did. As such they partake in the blame for any bricked focboxes that resulted in not letting any third party developers the change in communication protocol. Especially if the VESC-Tool updates tot he latest software which is something that everyone buying any non-vesc6 based esc is going to do.

Swift is an open-source joke, because it requires closed-source software to operate.  The apple way.  VESC requires no closed-source code to operate or change or modify.  You can hand-build the entire machine and all the software yourself, if you want to.

So yes,

Third party software allowing configuration should really read out FW version, check against a compatibility list and refuse configuration if the FW doesn't appear on the list. This is the hole point of FW versioning. Vesc-Toop has always done this for given reason.

It should, I agree.

But if you are supporting an API you should also refrain from doing breaking changes, unless you have a very good reason to!

The problem has nothing to do with open/closed source, if you have written a piece of software that integrates with others you should be careful with breaking changes. Give developers notice before hand and avoid changes not required.

Both parties are responsible, Vedder should have told everyone the changes are coming, and everyone else should have checked the version before sending commands.

It's in your interest to have 3rd party apps integrate with the VESC, it allows the HW to be used by more people.

```
If you connect a VESC with the latest FW to an old VESC-Tool, you will get a message that the FW on the device is newer than the supported FW and you have limited functionality, basically only allowing FW changes. Configuration is not possible. Even the old BLDC-Tool had a FW compatibility cross check. The first 4 command lines have never changed and this trivial check has to be absolute standard in all Apps. 
Command 0 = get FW version.
If the FW is not listed, your App should refuse to do anything other than offer FW update or downgrades, or state that no interaction is possible using the current FW. 

It is a safety feature that exists since the very beginning to avoid HW damages or software issues. Standard since years. You can even use the old BLDC-Tool to downgrade or upload FW to a recent device. 

Benjamin posted a video about the changes, we dropped a release notice here, so devellopers knew that a brand new tool is about to hit the market and it was obvious that the changes are massive and would require new FW support. 
Code release is happening probably tomorrow. There are a few changes to be made before everything can get uploaded to Github. 

The safest way to configure your device is always using the official release. 
Benjamin can't know how other Apps exactly interact or what they do. There are many Apps available and some are closed source. App developers are responsible for their releases. A FW version cross check should be a standard procedure to avoid mishaps. This is not the first time that changes in VESC-Tool require new FW and vice versa. 3rd party Apps will then have to adopt to the latest FW. Changes don't happen for the reason to annoy developers and users, they happen to bring new features and functionality to the market and are unavoidable, especially if things get shifted forward a lot. 
I introduced Roman to Benjamin and organized a meeting at Benjamins house. Both know each other and contact details have been exchanged, and matters have been debated.

Agree.

Nonetheless see how APIs usually handle than in the SW world. Search for "API deprecation".
You should have a sunset period at least so consumers have time to update their apps and end users don't get bricked devices.

No one is arguing against evolution, we are just asking (some with a bit of rage) that it is done properly. VESC FW is not a special piece of software that can't follow industry best practices.

This is not true, if you do breaking releases you are telling your customers that they can either use your apps or the third party one. That's just wrong unless you are trying to block third party apps.

Sunset period is one way to mitigate this problem. Being a one man army has nothing to do with it, does head count change what's a good practice or not?

Bricked devices shouldn't exist if the Apps would do crosschecks and would refuse to send  commands if FW doesn't match. 
This standard was implemented from the very beginning to avoid bricked or damaged devices. 4 simple command lines handle that. 

Vesc-Tool has the option to save the configuration into XMLs before updating to new FW. If you experience incompatibilities, you can simply upload the old FW, load XMLs and you are back to normal. Once the 3rd party App got updated you can update to the latest FW.

If things get bricked, it's not a problem of VESC-Tool. On top of that, the official HW releases always featured a SWD port to allow re-flashing. Devices without SWD port shouldn't exist. If anything goes wrong you are locked out and then things get more complicated. I prefer to have two doors and a key for the back door to hand.

The issue here is that you seem to think we’re piling the blame all on one man. We’re not . In truth **everyone** is an fault. The app developers for not implementing the necessary FW detection to prevent such from happening , The user for not doing all the assurances of getting the compatible firmware, and Ben for engaging in software breaking practices where 
there were absolute alternatives presents. 

Here’s the reality of what needs to be done and something I think *Everyone* can agree to :

1. All VESC-comptbaile applications Should do FW checks and block Read and writes if it is not on a list of Compatible Firmware. This can be as easy as creating an ever growing Enum/List and crosschecking the current FW to that structure. 

2. The Github **needs** releases and change logs. Screw that Vesc-forum bullshit. I shouldn't have to hunt down firmware in different locations and scour through to find them, much less someone who just bought a Focbox and needs to scour for specific versions. Utilizing Github's release feature is the cleanest and easiest for everyone, and it's something that you @trampa can do since Ben is so busy.  There is no reason why this is something isn't present on an ever-changing project like this. And change logs need to accomidate these releases (**On github**) or in a read.me file. There's no reason I should have to open the software to see what's changed.  

3. Any update that Vedder does **needs a grace period** one , so that third party applications can have time to see these changes and implemented them (and lets be real here , one of the reason the VESC is so backed is **because** the various third party applications , they need to be treated with more respect.) and two so that community's can give proper input of how the update affects their respective applications. 

I'm not trying to hit on Ben here , but everyone here needs to take responsibilities on how their actions cost money, time, and support.

Mate, get real! The new VESC-Tool is fully compatible with HW4.xx to the latest HW 6.6 (VESC 6Plus). A Focbox is a HW 4.xx design and can be configured using the new Software and Firmware. Benjamin even shows this in his video, configuring a 4.7 and 4.12 on his bike. 

The only HW that is incompatible is Unity, which was purposely designed to be incompatible with VESC-Tool and standard FW. 

VESC-Tool is OS and creating incompatibilities on purpose would not work, since someone could just change that part and have it compatible again. Believe me, someone would do that... 

If anything, bricking happens if a 3rd party app doesn't do FW version compatibility crosschecks and sends configuration commands although it shouldn't. This is a problem of such apps, not VESC-Tool. BLDC-Tool and VESC-Tool have always had a feature preventing such things from happening. First thing that happens when you connect to VESC-Tool is a FW compatibility check. If it fails, you have to load compatible FW before doing anything else. 

If an App writes settings without checking for compatibility, this is nothing Benjamin can prevent. The feature exists, but it needs to be used by the app connecting to the device.
FW have version numbers for a good reason.

I think you are being unfair now.
A. All the coding for the VESC tool  is being done by Vedder not Frank. So any problems you have with the fw should be directed at him. It was already mentioned by @rpasichnyk that it is Vedder that does not care about backwards compatibility. 
B. Not only focboxes were affected by the change that caused the escs to brick. The fact that you heard more about them is due to the fact that i) they are the most used esc in this community ii) they lack the pins to connect an ST link to upload the bootloader so it is even more of a hassle to solve the problem. I should know, I was one of the lucky guys affected.
C. I don't see how he told off half his customer base. If you stick to using vesc based hardware with the VESC tool there is no problem If you want to use 3rd party apps you need to make sure they are compatible before proceeding.
D. The solution to this problem has already been mentioned multiple times. 3rd party apps should check fw version before doing anything.

Maybe Vedder does not make it easy for 3rd party app developers (and in my opinion he should) but I don't see anyone else (apart from @Ackmaniac) writing firmware if you don't like Vedder's.

To be fair with Benjamin, let me mention what he answered in an issue I created on Github :

> Regarding compatible communication, I will write some documentation about that soon. The thing that is most likely to keep changing between firmware releases (for good reasons) is the motor and app configuration, but the other commands should be quite backwards compatible. At one point, when moving from BLDC Tool to VESC Tool, I inserted a command in the middle, but in the future I will avoid that.

Is it not a basic expectation that,  assuming Ben/Frank knew that this was an issue, we would be warned of this either in the app or more preferably at download?  Its also possible that they did NOT know it was an issue and released the app/firmware prematurely which is an entire different conversation.

I'm not saying Trampa or Ben is at fault, I'm saying they share at least some of the fault because of the lack of warning and that is either because the didnt know not as thorough testing was not done or they didn't care because it wasn't VESC (tm) hardware that would be nerf'd.

If the testing wasn't done then it should be a simple thing to say "sorry, didn't realize it was going to be an issue, here's how you fix it".  If they just don't care about 3rd party apps or hardware, at least be honest enough to admit it so people know to NOT use VESC(tm) apps/firmware on Non-VESC(tm) hardware.

In closing, I don't expect anything from Trampa.  For years they have not given a damn about the DIY community, profit is the holy grail.  This is just the second coming of the same old calvary as my Granpa used to say.

Let's make it simple.  One of 2 things happened here...

1.  The app & firmware release happened WITH the knowledge that it would brick non-VESC (tm) hardware and Trampa/Ben didn't care.
2.  The app & firmware release happened WITHOUT the knowledge that it would brick non-VESC (tm) hardware because Trampa/Ben didn't do sufficient testing.

Either one of those scenarios lays a substantial part of the blame on Trampa/Ben.

All software engineers should be using semantic versioning, including Vedder and third party addon developers, because it will allow for these software checks that you are pushing for to actually function properly.
&ZeroWidthSpace;

*A.B.C*

This means as long as A doesn't change, it's considered backwards-compatible.  Any change breaking backwards-compatibility has to increment A and reset B and C.

Incrementing B is for feature additions, and should reset C

Incrementing C is for bugfixes

So for example, a version "17.4.2" would be compatible with a future version "17.5.1" but not a "18.1.1"

The idea is to have one module only, handling all tasks. This module is ideally a NRF 51288.

@b264, we don't experience and esc dropouts. Non of our boards ever had such an issue. I'm not sure if you can pair two NRF modules simultaneously to one remote for redundancy reasons but I'll find that out. 

The downside of PPM receivers is that you don't know what happens when the receiver has an issue. It could go into a mode sending throttle/brake commands although you don't want that. The ESC can't know that something is funny with the receiver and would take the command. Having two receivers you double the chance for such failures. 

NRF receivers do not have this issue. They can't send an unwanted command. Either they work, or not. If they drop out, your board is free coasting or goes into a pre-defined brake mode. The past has shown that NRF 51 based modules work very vert reliable and interference doesn't really exist. 

Thing is: ESCs should be max reliable and simply work. In our experience with the VESC 6, spontaneous ESC dropouts do not occur. However, I can understand that redundant designs are always preferred.

If you have the knowledge and patience you can use module xyz. Past has shown: Some modules work better than others, and some are troublesome. I would say that its hardly worth the effort to make one yourself. Might save you 10 bucks that you spend on soldering and time later.

I'm not only talking about lost signal situations.  What if brine has ingressed the enclosure and shorts out an ESC?

There are so many things that could go wrong, and I think that Benjamin is doing lots of good things.  But you assuming that we will only be using that a certain way with everything interconnected is perhaps not realistic, and while it might work for a toy, there are more preferred ways for tools that must be relied upon.

Go in industry and tell to automation guys that they'd better use communication to drive motors instead of 4-20mA signals, with the same self-confidence. Come back and tell me the way they welcomed you. :slight_smile: 

I design automation systems embedding VFD drive fans which keep safety air pressure for underground workers exposed to radioactive hazards.
If one fails, lives are in danger. Evacuation is triggered.

For those reasons, driving motors by communication is FORBIDDEN.
Reliabilty and redundancy are the key.

However, I'm really bad about designing mountainboards. That's not my job.
So I can't have the arrogance to tell you that it's better to design a deck this way or this way and nobody should ride other shapes. :wink:

It is possible to identify connection issues of a PPM remote which is called Failsafe (my firmware mod can handle that, but not easy to understand how it works and can be configured)
When a signal loss or failsafe is detected the board shouldn't go into immediate coasting of predefined braking. It should ramp there otherwise you have no chance to adjust your body to the situation and crash. (My firmware mod does that as well)
And it should ramp as well back to power when the signal is back.
Saw a couple of people crashing because of that (very experienced ones as well @Nowind :wave:).

With the NRF you can control multiple ESC's at the same time if they use the same address, so it would be possible to have 2 receivers for redundancy but a bit tricky if you still want traction control.

In order to create the most reliable system, you need to sketch down what possibly can happen and then find the solution that has the lowest chance of failing under all circumstances. With DIY builders you don't know exactly which receiver they use, if that has fail safe, how good is the enclosure, what motors are use, cables connectors, batteries, BMS etc. Designing a system where you can define all components is something completely different. Then there is also theory and reality..... From all remotes we have tested so far, the NRF based ones are the ones that work flawless and do not need configuration in software. You pair them, they work and batteries last for ages. 

@Ackmaniac Failsafe on PPM is a feature of the receiver, basically sending neutral command or 120% command.  And it is specific and different for different receivers. The downside of that is you need to trust the receiver to always act perfectly like you expect it to do. We have no insight into how exactly those receivers work, since they are a black box and FW is not public,  and most of them are not designed for purpose.  Also people can do configuration wrong and think they have a good failsafe, while in reality it doesn't work.  It all comes down to the quality of the receiver, the remote and the users abilities, so we have two - three variables in such a system and still the VESC and the PPM receiver do not communicate. ESC simply takes signal and doesn't know what is going on in the communication. ESC is passive receiver of commands and needs to trust commander blind.  
The NRF FW is OS and we know exactly what is going on there, it is not a black box. We can define the way it interacts and we can implement appropriate features for fail safe. Many eyes on the code spot bugs faster and improvements can be done by multiple coders. 

Using a automatic failsafe brake is very debatable. In some situations it might be a good feature, in others it might cause more trouble than you already have. Soft ramping is a good idea for the fail-safe brake. 

This is all a bit off topic. It would be best to open a thread about such things:

Hi @keithcys, motor current can be done via profiles, which is for both VESCs. 
If you configure the currents and battery limits during setup, and write settings, you do all VESCs in one hit.
Edit: If you do changes in motor and app config, it is per VESC. 

You can still connect to single VESC and change individual settings via CAN forward.

Is it not a basic expectation that, assuming Ben/Frank knew that this was an issue, we would be warned of this either in the app or more preferably at download? Its also possible that they did NOT know it was an issue and released the app/firmware prematurely which is an entire different conversation.
[/quote]
Again, the vesc tool has been performing this basic fw check since the beginning. If all other tools did  the same nothing would have happened. The firmware worked just fine with the original vesc tool.

[quote="mmaner, post:201, topic:83619"]
I’m not saying Trampa or Ben is at fault, I’m saying they share at least some of the fault because of the lack of warning and that is either because the didnt know not as thorough testing was not done or they didn’t care because it wasn’t VESC ™ hardware that would be nerf’d.

If the testing wasn’t done then it should be a simple thing to say “sorry, didn’t realize it was going to be an issue, here’s how you fix it”. If they just don’t care about 3rd party apps or hardware, at least be honest enough to admit it so people know to NOT use VESC™ apps/firmware on Non-VESC™ hardware.

In closing, I don’t expect anything from Trampa. For years they have not given a damn about the DIY community, profit is the holy grail. This is just the second coming of the same old calvary as my Granpa used to say.

Hi @surfer, this remote uses the NRF 24, which we started with when making the VESC6 some years back. This chipset has some downside to it and we went for a better chipset to allow more data to be transferred. When Benjamin banged on VESC-Tool mobile, it was clear that you want one module to handle all tasks, communication to phone and communication to remote and more data throughput.

The NRF51288 allows to have communication between phone, remote and esc simultaneously, which is a big advantage. The amount of data that can be transferred is way higher and in respect you get better real time data and firmware updates can happen wireless without you falling asleep.

On Wednesday I'll have a last chat about the NRF with Benjamin  remote and then we will make something available fast. Benjamin and I are totally convinced about the NRF51-Remote. 
In his latest video he shows a prototype with basic functionality. We hacked that together to do some more R&D.... 
What is possible is a connection to a NRF24 receiver, using the NRF51288 remote. In practice you want a NRF51288 VESC-Connect dongle in your board, unlocking all the new features. Small invest, big difference!

Other nice thing about the nrf51822 is that it packs enough power to do more than just handle BT data. It can also do stuff like drive a small OLED display itself. Should make for smaller, more power efficient remotes (as you no longer need an arduino).

Additional this change might make new remotes super easy to make cause you basically just need a feather with the correct module on-board, the hall sensor and the oled. no more separate charging circuits or boost converters. and cause everything will run at 3v battery life might even be better.

nrf52 would be nice, from what I’ve read it’s quite the beast compared to the nrf51. That said the extra power may be overkill depending on what application you had in mind.

No, I don’t believe you could simply compile what’s in Vedder’s repo and upload to a nrf52. Vedder’s code doesn’t seem too platform specific, but there’s the config settings (sdk_config.h, etc) that certainly are. If I was going to attempt it I’d probably start with a working Nordic nrf52 based example, and then add Vedder’s code into it.

The NRF52 is a bit overkill for what we do at this stage. Thh51 does the trick and is more affordable. In the end we want a stable wireless connection and a reliable remote and we want an affordable solution that does work for us. So we decided to implement the 51 first. At some stage the 52 might find more attention. If someone is happy to do the job, he is well welcome to bang on the 52 and send a pull request once it works. another thing to consider is also energy consumption. A remote should be designed to consume as little energy as humanly possible, so that we can use it for 40-60 hours without recharging the battery.

_Pairing done flag. If this flag is set, a bluetooth connection can only be made if the VESC Tool instance making the connection has been paired to this VESC. The pairing is done by storing the UUID of the VESC in the pairing list._
:thinking: :confused:

Seems like this flag is only for VESC Tool? Not actually preventing any other apps to connect? Because `pairing_done` flag is not used at all in firmware code.

How is this supposed to be used?

```
If the flag is set, you won't be able to establish a connection with a random device/app. It blocks others from connecting and messing with your settings. VESC-Tool can store a list of UUIDs. The UUID must match to allow connection. 
The task is handled VESC side. 
You can pair multiple phones, tablets, computers to one VESC if you like. 

You use the same feature to block your app to connect to a random NRF module, so it can't be used with third party modules. 
The pairing feature of VESC FW is done the other way around. The hardware refuses connections from apps not knowing the UUID.

You will need to code a similar feature to allow your customers to connect to their VESCs in future. It is a matter of safety.

Why does the tool not allow for LiPo batteries as an option? It seems really strange to me that it has been left out of the options, as it directly impacts the battery percentage reading in the real time stats. ![Screenshot_20190224-112918|243x500](upload://4udi79Evev6GII9bfn4lhi1lF4R.jpeg)

We will ad some battery features. Battery percentage is hard to calculate exactly, since there are many different chemeteries available. Even Lipos can be different, depending on brand and chemistry. The biggest difference between lipos and liion is not the voltage at a certain charge level, but the voltage sag under load. 

Be sure to see some updates on this matter soon.

Well the nominal and the Max voltage is the same. Even  people agree the lowest cutoff to be 3.1, even though liion can go lower. So basically the default settings would be the same. That's why there isn't a lipo version.

@Ackmaniac True. But isn't that true for different li-ions say VCT vs 25R? Then we should be asking for the exact cell type/characteristics?

In my opinion, coulomb counting is a good way to determine the SoC, given all vescs are talking to each other and there is nothing else that's drawing significant current.

If it doesn't flash the FW, something got messed up. I have no clue how FW on metr. modules looks like. Since your first attempt was done using the metr. specific NRF 52 module, it could have caused an issue that needs fixing via ST-Link. If your VESC doesn't show new FW version after flashing, you should re-flash it via ST-Link.

> all VESCs talking to each other [via CAN bus]

That is actually a safe assumption in this case.

In order to be in this situation, a number of conditions would need to be met.

* Multiple motors
* Multiple VESCs (or a dual VESC but those are actually two VESCs under the hood)
* Bluetooth module or a nrf module
* User wants to track battery draw accurately 
* User either DIY’ed themselves, or contracted someone else to do it.

If you built the board, and wanted to track battery draw and other statistics wirelessly, chances are you wired the VESCs via can bus because that is the **only** way to accurately get this information.

If you chose a ppm splitter or dual receivers with no can bus, then you will not be able to accurately track battery draw.

Yes, b264, you want to build “tools not toys”, but don’t delude yourself. You are the only one here that chose dual receivers as a hill to die on.

I'm running into some problems setting up my focboxes with the vesc tool.

The focbox with the receiver attached (should be master) only shows 1 vesc when doing the motor setup and the signal setup. And the other focbox (should be slave) shows both vescs.

When I go to change the vesc ID (I set it to 0 on the focbox that should be master) and then connect to the 2nd focbox, it also has changed the ID of that one to 0. How is this possible?

Can someone help me understand how I can set the correct focbox as master / slave? 

thanks.

I changed my FSESC6 DUAL ackmaniac firmware 3.02 to latest firmware with VEST-Tool 2019, and my mountainboard (Turnigy Graphene 12S 12Ah, Maytech 6374) went very wrong. I set gear ratio, wheel diameter but the result was awful. Batt Max 99A et Motor Max 43A did no power. The board had not enough torque to run over the grass. I went back to ackmaniac firmware with my old parameters. I always wonder how much VESC seems to under-power a mountainboard compared to ROXXY 12S hobby car ESC with banks of capacitors. And this ESC only requires to set 3 parameters! No motor detection, no sensor but it's way more powerful. If FSESC6 DUAL is 12S then ROXXY feels like 14 to 16S.

Why didn't you up your motor amps to 65A or more? You can change all values manually. Just try to use the same values you used before. Otherwise its no comparison. 

Setting gear ratio and wheel diameter has zero impact on performance! You do that for accurate real time data display in Vesc-tool. Without these parameters the tool couldn't calculate the speed and couldn't display it. 

Also note that VESC-tool calculated the motor amps to be only 43A, which is to low for a 6374. I get 43A for a 6364 with 136kv. 
You should check your wiring. Maybe there is a bad connection somewhere, causing a high resistance. If calculated values are far off, it is a hint that something is funny with your wiring or motor windings or ESC. 

With regards to Roxxy: It has no current control. The ESC controls voltage and currents can shoot as high as they want, up to the point where the esc catches fire. If you put a VESC into bldc mode and use crazy high currents, you will get similar results power wise, but control of power is much better.

Thanks! I tried to set battery et motor currents to 65A and 85A on the fly. It was a little better. On the road it was OK but on the grass it felt less punchy than watt control provided by ackmaniac firmware. Start from still was very difficult on the grass, and it was just a little more powerful than 6S car ESC, obviously.  What I dislike with VESC is this kind of latency when I pull the trigger. Maybe I'm just bad at setting it, and it's possible official VESC6 is better… On my electric longboard (unikboard), no doubt VESC (4) performs well, but I always feel that for a moutainboard it doesn't do the job. It was the same with FOCBOX. I use the ROXXY for 2 years now and no fire. That's possible I'm just lucky. They are damn so good. Did you try them once?

Try 75A motor max, 75A battery max, -35A motor min, -35A battery min. 
These settings should give you ample power. Try to use low values for ramping in app config. 0.1sec on positive ramping should give you very direct and aggressive  controls.
Watt control is a feature that is highly debatable and is probably only noticeable better if your settings are funny in the first place. People tend to use non symmetric values for battery max/min and motor max/min.  They don't understand how these values interact. 

Very often I see setups with motor regen values of -80A and battery min of -10A, motor max of 80A and battery max of 30A. Those settings act like extreme throttle curves and create non linear throttle response, bad braking at speed that gets very aggressive when speed decreases, high acceleration at low speed with sudden loss of power...
If your settings are nice and symmetric, like I suggested for your board, there is no need for a watt-control patch. 
If you can, go for:
Motor max = Battery max, Motor regen = Battery regen. 

No worries, in realieallity your battery will not see the charge currents you enter. No one pulls full brake at full speed with those settings.

The same here 90A battery amps for both esc and 24A -24A motor current. Setting everything manually to previous values made the board feeling equally strong, but still @Ackmaniac 's firmware feels more sophisticated and smooth. I will return to that. 
Assuming the wizard is for people with only basic knowledge, the resulting 90A battery amps might cause a lot of headache.

The 90A will cause nothing. With 24A motor side, you can't pull more than 24A from the battery. You could also drop in 1000A. 
Battery values should ideally be equal or higher than motor amps.

There is an advanced tab, allowing to set the currents manually. You can drop in your max values there. If you have a 40A BMS in the discharge rail, you would simply drop in 40A/-40A (for single drive) or 20A/-20A (dual drive). Going into config after setup, you will see that batt max/batt regen will be limited to the values you specified. So if your system needs a limitation, you can do that with ease (in wizard or in motor config of each VESC)
On the other hand side you should question yourself why you chose to use a 40A BMS when your motors have a max drain of eg 75A. Components should be chosen to safely handle the currents expected in your system. The VESC has the advantage to be able to set limits, but in general it is wise to build a system with properly matched components and a battery that can handle the expected currents. Weak performance on the battery/BMS side affect your brakes! Rule of thumb: max braking power should be within a certain relation to max acceleration power. Cars can usually brake harder than they can accelerate. Don't build rockets with poor brakes!
If you wire a BMS into the discharge rail, you have to rely on it to work at all times! I would never do that for safety reasons. Things can fail on you.
If a discharge BMS fails on you, you will have two major problems: 
A) you loose your brakes spontaneously (disconnected battery)
B) you fry your VESC(s) instantly when pushing the brake lever.
```

## \#306 Posted by: trampa Posted at: 2019-02-25T08:04:39.069Z Reads: 203

I would slightly lower the motor amps to 70A, battery max 60A, motor regen -35 to -40A, battery regen - 35A. Always try settings that are relative symmetric (batt/motor)
It also depends on where you live and what you do. Riding steep hills very often and for extended periods of time, might require battery amps to be set more conservative to prevent to much strain on the battery side. Short bursts of high amp draw and regen charge are less of a problem than continuous high amp flow.

Thanks for your reply! 
I have a 80A BMS, no trouble.
I just wanted to suggest that people who have never used the old VESC tool could run into issues. Now with cheaper chinese ESC's avaiable, running Benjamins firmware, there will be people upgrading their prebuilds or buying those battery packs with weak BMS's. I am also guilty for buying a 10S5P pack with a 40A BMS as my first battery. 
All what is needed is just a little warning like the one when you choose your motor size to not exceed the limits of your battery or BMS with the hint to set this in the advanced tab. 
That you can do detection for both motors at once is awesome, for me personally the old wizard was more intuitive.

Yes, and if you read carefully, you will see that. However, if you have 120 A max motor drain in a twin setup, and allow 40A battery drain combined, you will have big power to a point where the VESC will limit motor currents to save your battery from to much strain. This will cause a non linear throttle response and loss of power starting at 33% duty. Now you could use throttle curves to compensate that a bit, but this like putting a curve over a curve and is not very controllable and predictable. When it comes to braking, things get worse. Battery max regen defines your brakes at speed, while motor max regen is dominant at low speed. If people use low values for battery max regen, they end up with to soft brakes when they need them most. Your brakes want a high P-count battery to store the braking energy fast and safe. 

We all know that the adjustments you can make in VESC-Tool allow for settings matched with your hardware. But it is highly debatable if it makes sense to go for monster motors in combo with a very small battery. Personally I prefer matched components, big motors, capable, three phase shunt ESC, high P-Count battery with high drain cells. 12S2P batteries in combo with dual 6374 is sort of funny, especially when it comes to proper barking behaviour.

No not yet. Have been willing to try that though. But I’m actually pretty pleased with my current settings. Just need to be able to trust this thing now since it cut off on me at the end there while going 48 kph. 
Luckily at this constant speed you hardly feel the loss of power. Brakes luckily also kept working. So I didn’t fall off and could brake to a stop. 

Strange thing is that afterwards I unplugged the loop key then replugged it and it would not go on. Was already mentally preparing options to get home, aka calling the wife and pushing to a spot that is accessible by car, but then while kick pushing it suddenly turned on and I was able to happily finish my ride.

@trampa Ok I kept ackmaniac firmware because I wanted to do it fast (I spend more time changing firmware, removing chains and doing motor detection than riding). I set Motor Max 85A, Batt Max 85A, Motor Min -40A, Batt Min -40A, and positive ramping 0.1 sec. I kept FOC, even if I wonder if I shouldn't try BLDC considering what Pimousse said. 

Startup on grass is still a little hard, but after that the board feels noticeably more powerful. Brakes are too weak a little on road and I'll set Motor Min and Batt Min to -60A. 

Thanks.

Like garseng, I experienced cut-off during acceleration with 2019 official firmware, but I first thought it was because I changed settings on the fly with Metr Pro and I did something wrong, but actually when checking parameters at home with VESC Tool connected to my board with USB I saw nothing wrong.

You said your 6364 136kv motors were given 45A motor max with VESC Tool 2019. The kv of my 6374 ones is 130. I think nothing's with wiring. The two motors are given almost the same amps by the Tool.

So the motor is limited in what it can take and you should carefully up the Amps to the point where problems start to occurr. Our 136kv 6364 will take 45A and they are built to proper spec A-Z. Assuming the Maytech is lower in KV but has a longer stator, 55-60A might already be the very limit for the motor. 
Batt max has no impact, as long as it is equal or higher than motor max.

Maybe i’m Wrong but 
The battery min is the current come back to your battery so for like a battery 12s7p 18650 30Q can handle 28A so the battery min for each vesc should be -14A for not domage your battery if you do full break 
I’M WRONG !!!!!

And battery max is what your battery can give you so for this battery is 105A (discharges 15A) 
So each vesc battery max is 52,5A 
I’M WRONG TO ????

**Battery Max** can be **lower** than motor max, which means you will loose power on high duty cycle. Example: 80A motor max, 40A Batt max results in loss of power beyond 50% duty cycle. At 100% duty, you motor will only get 40A delivered.  The Vesc simply scales down max amp draw on motor side gradually. 
On motor side: Till 50% duty 80A, 75%duty 60A, 100% duty 40A

**Batt max equal to Motor max:** up to 100% duty your motor gets the full 80A
**Batt max higher than Motor max:** same as above. Motor max defines max amp flow from battery. 80A is the limit. You could also define 1000A batt max without any impact on the result. 

**Batt max regen:** defines braking strength at full speed (100% duty). Needs to result in proper brakes, shouldn't be set very low! Modern batteries like the 30Q can handle a short inrush of high currents. 30A is a good rule of thumb to start with for a 4P Samsung 30Q pack. Motor max regen should be about the same or a bit higher (eg 40A).
Note: These currents drop very fast with dropping speed (dropping duty). We are talking about seconds of current inrush. And pushing full brakes at full speed would send you flying anyways. Your trigger finger will limit the ampflow. 

**Battery safe charge currents:** Data sheet values refer to charging for extended periods of time.

Dropping in higher values than your motor can handle will not result in more power output. Once the stator is saturated, it is saturated. More Amps will only make your motor cogg or generate unnecessairy heat.  You need to find the spot where you saturate the stator and go a bit below that value. That is the sweet spot for max performance from your motor. 

One way to get better performance is a faster motor and more gearing. You get a lot more torque at the wheels from the same motor size if KV is high and gearing is high.
We use 6378 160kv with 1:6 gearing on our top range spur gear MTB. That board is frightening power wise.

Ok but you still have to make the value work with the battery you have bc a 12s7p of 30Q can give you 105A 140A if you push the cell so 80A each vesc make 160A total so you will never get this from your battery or i’m Wrong 
And you told me a 4p 30Q can handle I know is very quick but it can handle 40A so for a 4p 30Q you can set it up your battery min at -20 each vesc 🤔🤔🤔🤔

Just set batt max to match battery output performance. Batt min could be set to -25 for each VESC in your example. 

The max values you enter will never be reached for long periods of time. Look at an metr.at tracked ride and you will see that high drain and high regen occurrs as spikes only. In reality this is no big issue for a quality battery.

The only scenario where you drain a lot over a long period of time is an extended up hill ride. 
If you face such steep hills you should set batt max conservative. Going down a steep hill with constant brakes applied is the scenario where you put max strain on the battery via high amp charge. If you plan to ride up and down steep hills you need strong brakes and in consequence you need a high quality, high P-Count battery or LiPo setup. It would be dangerous to ride down steep hills with 10A battery max regen, leaving you with weak brakes when you need them most. 

In hilly areas, big LiPos have an advantage over 18650.

There is no regen at extremely low speeds right? But the brakes still do work? The way I understood it there are three modes of braking
1. No braking: when motor circuit is open
2. Non regen braking: when the motor windings are shorted for a short amount of time
2. Regen braking: when the above short is removed and battery is connected to the motors. Obviously the bemf+ inductive spike has to be greater than battery voltage.

The reason I ask the above 2 question is I am not sure what happens when I have large motor regen current but low battery regen current settings? According to you, there won't be any brakes. Why can't the VESC use non-regen braking(assuming there is sufficient cooling and the mosfets are not heating up too much)
```

Regen is always firing current towards the battery. There is no other way to handle that. a short in the motor phase will pretty much block your wheels instantly.
The motor is a generator and the generated energy needs to go somewhere. Somewhere is your Battery. 

This is why it is important to have Battery max regen high enough! If you close the gate towards the battery, you can't store the generated energy and the VESC will cut back motor max regen to a matchng value.
**Example:** Battery max regen is -12A, motor max regen is -50A, single VESC, you ride at full speed and push the brake hard.
**What happens:** Your VESC will limit the motor max regen to -12A, which results in roughly 600W braking power for a 12S setup. With decreasing duty cycle, your motor regen amps go back up (24A at 50% duty), but regen voltage also drops, so 600W braking is the max you will get with -12A Batt regen. Strong brakes require the gate towards the battery to be open wide enough! It is not advisable to ride a powerful board without sufficient brakes. 

**Battery max regen defines your max braking strength** and should **not** be set **very** **low**.

Hi David, just talked to Benjamin. He thinks your motors might not have max possible copper fill and 45A could be a realistic value for the motor. We tested some different motors and the reality is: Some motors are hand would and have a high copper fill and take more amps, others have a poor copper fill and take considerably less amps. Copper quality can also differ a lot. 
So it is wise to carefully work your way up from estimated values. Always change values on both VESCs, using CAN-forward to connect to the second VESC.

Another way to get higher Amps calculations is to **carefully** adjust the **Power losses value** during setup (override the standard parameters). Benjamin shows that in his video. Test have shown that the standard parameters VESC-Tool uses are good and reliable for a wide range of motors. We get pretty accurate current assumptions for all kinds of motors using the standard heat loss parameter. So there is not really a good reason to change those parameters.

Okay, I understand the single phase regen pretty well thanks to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW3PmRp7EK8) youtube video, but I guess it doesn't translate too well to 3 phase regen. I'll try to read up on it. 

But on a conceptual level, somewhere a circuit is being closed so that the backemf starts driving the circuit and then that circuit is broken and the current is redirected to battery. Maybe a electrical engineer(@DerelictRobot maybe?) can educate me or point to right resources.

It calculates max amps via heat losses. We know the resistance and some other parameters of the motor and we know that an Outrunner of the size we use has about 50W heat losses. That value is adjustable, but has proven to be nearly identical for a certain motor size. Now we can calculate max Amps the motor can take. The calculation is quite accurate, but is adjustable if needed. The adjustment can be done in the wizard. Watch Benjamin's video to see how it is done.

You can only push a certain amount of Amps towards a motor. Usually this matches the point where you  saturate the stator. Power losses and max Amp flow are in a relation. To find out how good your motor is you need to compare it's weight to resistance and flux linkage values. Benjamin tested a lot of motors and he found out that the formula he uses is producing very accurate max amp assumptions. If your motor is a 80mm diameter outrunner, it surely has more power losses (absolute value). In that case you need to adjust a bit. 

When selecting the motor size and type, you can tick the box at the bottom and override values used for the calculation. Up the **power losses** to get higher Amp assumptions. You could go from 60, 70 or 80W. 
Try to find a value that re-produces a similar Motor max as you have  successfully used before. Share this info with the community. 

![Power%20losses|283x500](upload://2Tz5ZvkBbsfugKdyCljwWd6ktxC.jpeg) 

VESC-Tool will get some updates and we will try to feed in more data from different motors and naturally the amp assumptions will get more and more precise. So listing the motors in a thread makes sense.

It will not take long and VESC-Tool will be able to identify your motor by it's values. Each motor has sort of a DNA. You can open the tab "**Additional Info**" in **Motor Settings** and type in your motor manufacturer, model and weight and kV and size. If you share the motor XML in the VESC-Project forum, we will have the values of all motors used and can ad them to a list to choose from. 

https://vesc-project.com/node/811

We need the **size** eg. **6374**, **KV**, **manufacturer**, **model**, **motor XML**, ideally the **weight** of the motor.

Try and use the new VESC-Tool. Simply download it again from "Purchased Files" top right on the VESC-Project.com website. 
In order to give you recommendations, you need to post the entire setup, exact motor, battery, BMS?, wheel size, gearing.

A 3P NCR 18650 Pack is only capable of delivering 17.4 amps, which is way to low, especially at 7S
Usually we try to use 15A to 20A rated cells in a 10S4P or 12S4P configuration.

You would need to set **battery max** to 17A and **battery max regen** to maybe -10A
Your cell can only deliver 5.8A per cell! That is nothing for a skateboard.

@trampa, Frank, this would be question for Benjamin, but maybe you could ask him sometime for me. I have a couple of robots that use VESCs. Right now I am requesting data and then receiving data from the VESC through UART. This adds to the latency, so is there anyway of making VESC constantly stream data to be read by a microcontroller. Or if he has an entirely different approach/solution to this problem.

I think battery was drained faster with 3.48 comparing with ackmaniac.

There's always a huge lack of power with FSESC6 DUAL FOC 3.48/Maytech 6374 130kv/Graphene 12Ah 15C compared to ROXXY 9120-12 Opto/Turnigy SK3 6374 192kv/Graphene 12Ah 65C.

ROXXY can make the board drift almost all the time. It's like leiftech on dirt. Maybe because batteries and motors are more powerful on this build I don't know.

So 75A is to much and 65A is the limit. If your motor coggs, you shoot to many Amps. 
Battery drain has nothing to do with FW, but your ride style, how much you accelerate and brake and how fast you go in average on a certain surface.

Offical FW has a nice linear and direct throttle response. If you want it softer it is easy to adjust that via **ramping time.** Just enter values in between 0.1 an 0.9s. This value defines the time constant to ramp power from one input value to another. 
**Example:** going from 30% to 50% throttle, the VESC will ramp up the power within time X. If you want instant power delivery, you choose 0.1seconds, if you want it softer, you go for 0.6s or any value that suits you. Ramping is the best way to define throttle response. Throttle curves can be used in addition, but are second choice to adjust things. 
If you want more power on less throttle movement, you simply pull up the curves to give you more power output to lower throttle input command. The board will get more aggressive in consequence.

"Upload all" is the button. You can always access the slave via can forward. If you know the ID, you can set it manually. Click on list all no scan and select ID 1, which is usually the slave ID setting in the old VESC Tool. If it doesn't work, select ID 2. Then you activate can forward and see if you get access. Then go to FW tab and upload the new FW to the slave. No need to grab the tools...

Nice job with the new firmware, looks awesome - high praise for Benjamin! However, as always, I wonder if there will be any information regarding interfacing with these new features, mostly I am intrigued by any information regarding:

Communication between remote, phone/tablet and VESCs simultaneously (triangular communication).

I would love to make a remote to be used by the community, compatible with the new NRF dongle. I would however much appreciate **not** having to look through all the new software to identify the functionality needed to reverse engineer a protocol.

I have been working on a new remote, using standard nrf24 modules, however, it should be quite easy to modify the PCB to house an nrf51 board instead. Hoping to hear from you @trampa

Thanks for your reply, however I do not quite understand the "support of nrf 51 and 52", doesn't the NRF dongle (sold on your website) ship with a nrf51? I am interesting in how I can initate a pairing with the dongle, and how I should communicate with it. Does the dongle work as a wireless UART bridge/link enabling me to send UART commands directly to the VESC over BLE? Thanks :-)

The Nrf 52 can communicate with the dongle, having the NRF 51. Yes, it's a UART bridge @solidgeek. We also get RT Data to the remote.

Profiles could probably be switched via remote, but for the now it's an App feature, since the profiles are stored on your phone.

Okay thank you, so in order to allow for multiple connections (app and remote) the dongle must do some sort of multiplexing, while keeping track of the commands origin in order to return the correct response to the correct device? The source code for the nrf51 dongle found on github (https://github.com/vedderb/nrf51_vesc) was last updated 11 months ago, I suppose this is not the software loaded on the nrf dongle you ship? :slight_smile: 

Would be awesome if you could point me in the direction where to find more information regarding the nrf dongle and how to interface with it.

Benjamin hopes to find a way to update the dongle via the VESC 6. Sure you can flash the FW using a computer, but it is not straight forward like using the ST-Software for flashing a VESC. 
Personally I haven't tried it myself. We designed the dongle to have an SWD port, so that it can be flashed and updated. We don't want to sell you what you already have....

When I view the following tutorial:

The first screen I get in the Input Setup Wizard is the remote selection.  It does not give me the option to select whether I am using multi VESC for master.

I cannot find out why my Input Setup Wizard skips directly to the remote Choose App section of wizard without showing me the Multiple VESC option.


Can someone please help me figure out how I can set up slave vs master given this problem?

Thanks for the response, but I still cannot figure out how to get slave set up.  I set up motors on both VESC I have CAN connecting master to slave then i set up the controller on the master.  This results in only one motor (master) spinning.  I have updated the firmware on both VESCs.  Not sure what I am missing.  In the previous workflow it was clear to designate the slave, when does this 'automation' happen in new workflow?  Thanks for engaging on this thread, very lucky to have such a tool and support.

First check: CAN you connect to the slave via master (CAN Forward)?

On the mobile VESC-Tool start page you can click on LIST ALL (NO SCAN), or SCAN CAN BUS. 
If you can't find the slave via a scan:  Connect to Slave ESC directly, set the VESC ID on the slave manually (ID 1) and write configuration. Reconnect to the master and click on LIST ALL (NO SCAN). Select the ID 1 and activate the CAN forwarding. Now you should be forwarded to the Slave.

Do both ESCs have the latest FW installed? If they have, you can update the FW on both simultaneously and each ESC will get an ID automatically assigned. 

If CAN doesn't work, one CAN chip might have a damage. On the old 4.xx hardware both ESCs need to power up simultaneously (ideally via the same battery connection/switch). If you fail to power them up simultaneously, the CAN chip will blow (if CAN is connected). Y-PPM, as suggested by other users, is not recommended and will create a ground loop in your system, which potentially damages the voltage regulator circuit on one or both ESCs over time. HW 4.xx is quite tolerant to such GND Loops, but that doesn't mean you should go for Y-PPM. Another way to have two ESCs set up is using two receivers, paired to one remote. 

Another thing to note:  A CAN cable only features CAN L and CAN H wire connections. Do not connect V+ and GND! CAN L to CAN L and CAN H to CAN H only!

I set just upgraded my 3rd board to the new VESCtool firmware. I can tell you there's some oddity happening with the wizard and the CAN forwarding which made me spend an hour instead of minutes getting it to work.

When freshly upgraded to the new firmware, the motor detection wizard just did not work right off the bat. On one occassion the terminal said "low battery" or something to that extent. This seemed to be resolved when I manually changed the voltage tab within the motor settings. Then yesterday was even more bizarre, nothing happened at all, it just wrote some config then nothing. In the end I had to set the motors up individually.

After the motors were setup individually the old fashioned way, and the CAN was definitely also setup. For some reason my remote could only turn one wheel, no amount of changing of parameters could get both to spin up.

I then returned back to the wizard and somehow this time it did the detection across both motors seamlessly. After which the motors turned in unison as they were supposed to.

Throughout the process I also got the message that the ESCs were not running the same firmware (when they were the same). This happened when I was trying to determine the rotation direction as well as when trying to setup the inputs via the wizard.

Also, all 3 boards had a slightly different issue. My single drive would just refuse to auto-detect, my Dual Flipsky 4.2 ESC would have the low battery warning, but my dual Focboxes were the most troublesome.

In the end I have no idea what exactly was it that I did to get everything to work properly. 

So if you are having problems, try individually setting up the motors first, make sure they spin correctly via the arrow keys on the keyboard, make sure you can get them so spin via the new direction testing UI, then if that still doesn't work, run it through the auto-detection.

So unless I missed a critical step somewhere, something strange is happening with the wizards.

Is it actually telling you that your firmware is old or is it just warning you that you have to be up to date. I was confused but that too, but then I read it again and it was simply informing you to be up to date with latest firmware. 

Try it this way. 
1. Download VESC Tool but one version older
2. Update firmware of 1st, than 2nd vesc
3. Download latest VESC Tool, connect to Master, and upload both at once.
4. Set up motors and input.

How important is it to do motor detection without belts?
Since I need to redo motor detection every time the vesc fw is updated, having to remove the belts is really difficult. I have done motor detection with the belts on and it seems to work just fine even on the 2019 Trampa Pro belt drive with the v-ring installed which causes quite a bit of drag.

4.) Perform motor set up on ESC2, the motor spins
5.) Perform app set up on ESC1, comes up with both ESCs, Select ESC1, complete app set up write.
6.) When using the remote only ESC1 motor moves.

At any point should I be clicking the Forward Communication over CANBUS button on the right tool bar?  I figured since it was detecting ESC2 during app set up, this is not required.

Scan CAN-Bus and see if the VESC-Tool finds your slave. Tick the box " Activate" (mobile) or the CAN Forward Button (desktop). You should now be logged into the Slave. Go to APP CFG, select PPM and GENERAL, Locate MULTIPLE VESCs over CAN.
Is it switched OFF? Slave is switched off (False), Master is Switched ON (True).

Both VESCs need a different ID. You can either let VESC-Tool determin the ID, or set it manually. (e.g. ID0 and ID1).

On the other hand side, you should be able to just run the wizard and things should work.

Please update to the latest 1.07 VESC-Tool.
For some motors the 1.06 version could create some cogging, due to the Temperature Compensation feature. The new 1.07 uses a different algorithm to calculate the motor parameters and has Temperature Compensation switched off.

Unity is technically a more simple device, that is limited to the use of a modified VESC-Tool derivate.
Since it has no dedicated processors for each ESC, but shares one processor amongst two ESCs, VESC-Tool will not be able to configure the Unity. You will need to wait until Enertion finds the time to integrate the latest software features into their VESC-Tool derivate. 
Unity is a bit like a computer that can only run a certain Linux distribution.  
Don't try to use VESC-Tool to configure the Unity. Hardware damages might occur!

I’m surprised it reads that high battery current. In fact that’s impossible since my motor amp is set to 80 and battery amp to 50.

This is my speed run and I didn’t reach that high.

In FW 1.06 its basically temperature compensation that can cause the resistance value to be set to high. This causes a cogging when you push the trigger hard. Nothing that would throw you off, just a shaking. FW 1.07 sorted that.

Something with value: In future every VESC can function as a programmer that works on almost any microcontroller from any platform. Be surprised, keep your VESC-Tool updated! The feature will be part of a near future VESC-Tool update. 
You will be able to re-flash a VESC with another VESC, or a NRF-module, or a remote, or a BMS or anything else incorporating a microcontroller. Got no ST-Link or no Linux, no skills programming microcontrollers, don't worry VESC-Tool will fix your problem. Just make sure your ESC and secondary device features a SWD port as standard. This will save you plenty of cash and headaches on the long run.

The ST-link and ST utility doesn't work for all microcontrollers. In many cases you need extra skills or software to flash a certain micro controller. The new feature will allow you to use your VESC-Tool to re-flash your devices with a single click. This will save you cash, since you can easily upgrade existing controllers to run the latest FW. For example we want our customers to be able to re-flash an existing Trampa NRF-Dongle to work with the latest remotes that are about to hit the market. No need to buy a new dongle, simply because the FW is outdated. In the end we all want our equipment to be useful for many years and keep it running as long as possible.

I had some more time today to test the new VESC Tool with Metr Pro. There is an issue with App Input Wizard, when using TCP bridge, it (almost) never works. The recommended solution is to NOT use the Wizard and do the configuration manually. I posted some technical details of the problem on [GitHub](https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_tool/issues/29) and hope Benjamin will find time to look at it.

Finally went out for a short test ride with FW3.53, everything seems to work fine.

Oh, then there is something to dig.
The 2 points before are 34,8v then 26,2v, both with 0A currents.
The duty cycle increases due to PID Control, this is a normal behaviour.
All other values are normal as well (temperatures, speed...).

To me, it sounds like you had a micro power cut.
But caps maintained the VESC alive.
Check your soldering (power connectors and caps).

You also have data transfer to consider. The BLE connection is not super mega fast, update rate is limited a bit and in consequence the readings are not totally accurate. It also depends on the design of the ESC. Two battery side shunt ESCs can't read currents and voltages as accurate as three high side shunt ESCs with shunt amplifiers and filtering.

I just updated my firmware to the latest version from vesc_tool mobile(1.07). I have cogging(at low speed) just before coming to stop. High speed braking has not cogging. The motor shudders. I am going to run the detection again and see if that solves the problem.

Edit: Went through the same process again, no difference. Still have cogging. Anyone else?

## \#452 Posted by: trampa Posted at: 2019-03-26T07:49:08.051Z Reads: 180

```
A bit of cogging is normal on the last bit of RPM when braking. This is unavoidable, since at that motor speed tracking of the rotor is very difficult. It depends on many factors. Some motors might cogg less than others and some boards use more gearing and others are poorly geared. Our boards don't cogg, but you can feel a bit of fine ripple vibration from 2Km/h to zero. This is the speed where the VESC used to short out the motor phases and create max braking strength. 
If you would use a AS5047P Sensor, you would not feel cogging a all. The halls are just not precise enough and back EMF is not giving good feedback at such low speeds.

No change. Even on a very slight braking from the remote(hence very low braking current),  it starts cogging badly before stopping. Not pleasant at all. It's very similar in unsensored setup too.

I can't go back to the old setting. I used the mobile app and hence never saved my settings. 

BTW, I am on firmware 3.53. Anyone else who's updated theirs using the version from the app store?

I see that the VESC Tool change log says "Added missing I_max_erpm_fbrake parameter", I wonder if this has any relation to my problem.

The cogging problem is definitely a bit annoying. If I am forced to ride behind people walking then I have to accelerate and brake mildly and this is where it behaves weirdly. Cogging vibrating and the running smoothly for a bit and doing it again. I am on FOC BTW. If this was a standard behavior, I wouldn't be saying anything. It happened all of sudden(after updating firmware) and is quite noticeable. 

@helpmebuild seems to have the same problem.

Like @taz said could the firmware 3.47 have caused this?

Are you running hall sensors? Weirdly the low speed brake fix can have some undesirable interactions with the low speed braking I have noticed. Try re-running your hall sensor calibration and see if they are nice and evenly spaced. I had one board with a slightly loose hall sensor connection that would go in and out and produce some of the annoying behavior you describe.

You have to know that the Module will serve for multiple purposes. In future this will also be the link into your remote and VESC-Tool and maybe other devices like an on board display, BMS etc. You might be limited to use only one Module, depending on your HW/software setup. So this module should be flexible to handle all the tasks. Technically one VESC attached module is enough and often also the only option you have. 
We have a Module that can be upgraded software/FW wise via VESC-Tool. New features like remote controller support might require a FW update on the module itself! This one is future proof:

http://www.trampaboards.com/vesc-connect-nrf-wireless-dongle-p-26767.html

It will not work with Metr, since that App is locked down to communicate only with modules that Roman sold. Even if you would buy a module that has perfectly the same Spec, Metr will not allow a connection because the UUID is not listed in the APP. If you want to use that App, you need a Module from Roman! 

Please note that such a module might not be compatible with VESC-Sollutions, since it runs it own FW and not the Open Source Vedder Code!

The other thing is RAM size 16/32 of the module and the oscillator frequency 16/32Mhz.

Technically they all work, but FW might need changes to make the module run.

I just tried again with some new nrf modules. Worked fine with openocd. Vesc tool can find the modules. 

But again the modules don't show up when flashed through the new vesc tool.

That is probably because the FWs in VESC-Tool are specific to a certain HW configuration and pin usage. I can flash our modules just fine with VESC-Tool, 100% success.

Seems pretty close to just getting an android wear device then though I'm sure you could find some cheap small android phones still.  Guess if people want to jailbreak their iOS device and sideload apps then would still be possible but lose all the advantage exposure on the app store gives you and going to be a niche group within a niche group.  There's another thread about iOS bluetooth telemetry though and someone already wrote an app (apparently not based on vesc-tool ?)

Are there any submodules or code in the VESC Tool that is licensed under GPL and that is not owned by Vedder?

If the whole codebase is Vedders, then he can simply publish it to the AppStore with a different licenses that is conflicting with the Apple Developers ToS.

If he does not own the whole code base, it should be checked if the owner of the GPL code could give Vedder the code with a different license.

That’s not really correct. There is no restriction from apples end on gpl licensing. I’d say the issue is that the gpl chosen is too restrictive for the apps store’s requirements. Have the authors of vesc tool explored other versions of the gpl that may be less restrictive ? Is this really a case of licensing or is there an anti apple agenda here (I’d understand if there was). These days releasing an app on a single platform is just bad planning. 

And thats a shame. Unfortunately having to get a dedicated phone to use a single app isn’t realistic.

The GPL is applied and that's the way it is. Sure Vedder could publish his software under any license he wants and he could compile his work for Apple, but that won't happen. Apple and Vedder are no good friends, so the skate phone is compulsory. Everyone else is bound to the GPL which is not App-Store compatible.

Something like VESC Tool takes years to code. On top of that, maintenance is a huge pile of work. 70 bucks for a cheap Android phone is worth it. You can fix that to the board and don't need to worry about it to much. I thought of integrating a small phone into the enclosure, 5V step down converter, permanent on. You can't get a touch screen odometer and config tool cheaper.

Apple is one of the largest supporters and contributors of open source software. In this case it is not apple restricting the usage, but the chosen GPL. I didn't really expect to see an android vs iphone debate sparked by eskate riders. I guess they exist everywhere? I've developed on both platforms for a long time. Both have their pluses and minuses. 

Someone earlier mentioned people being foolish for choosing a specific mobile device. I guess every online forum has at least one person who believes ridicule and alienating is an acceptable way of communicating with people. Given that with the apps we create, there is generally an 80/20 split favoring the iPhone, foolish would be limiting your user base without a good reason. 

Apple are no saint of a company, but if you're going to try take a moral high ground, then take a good look at google. They are equally if not more evil. They are both mega corps with one goal, taking money from us. They both screw us, but only from different ends. But without either we would not have the devices we have today. To say that either of them impede innovation is ignorant. Both have been some of the largest supporters of innovation we have seen in the last 30 years.

You're misunderstanding the situation. Apple don't care if you upload GPL'd software. It's not apple's license agreement you'll be breaching by uploading GPL software to the app store. It's the GPL you'll be breaching. Apple will not come after you if you upload GPL software to the app store. The owners of the GPL'd software will. It's an easy concept to understand if you bother to read apple's license agreement, and the GPL.

Dearest Frank

I have noticed some odd behaviour setting up the V4 VESC.  Two weeks ago I installed V3.56 and ran a full setup setting the motors up for FOC, all went well.  Today I setup another v4 pair of VESC's with 3.57 exactly the same and this time I could tell straight away they were in BLDC mode.  A quick check on the mobile VESC tool confirmed and I was able to switch it to FOC.  Also I noticed reading the data from the VESC's they were not the values I had set for currents in the actual desktop tool.  The strange thing is my friend also had a similar thing happen to him on the same firmware, after going through FOC setup his was setup in BLDC also. @trampa

I can confirm that. Strange behaviour with the latest FW. I set up my new Landwheels and at first I thought they had some problems, checked in the VESC Tool and voila, they were set for BLDC :) When I change it to FOC they worked like a charm though :)

:D Ok, thats basically a very good thing since there are many 4.12 based ESCs out there that don't work well in FOC but a better description would have been great. The new (nice) App denies to work properly with old FW most of the time so communication about major changes might need to improve :)

which is basically preventing you from setting up in FOC is it not? I choose FOC and it gives me BLDC.  Not really what one would expect.

Also Frank, When setting up the firmware update for the hardware it was supposed to update over CAN, which it did, but then when I went to do detection it told me that both VESC's had to be on the same version firmware? I connected to the slave directly, checked the firmware which indicated it had been updated but I decided to do another firmware update regardles.  Then I plugged back into the master and detection worked.

Sometimes it takes another try when that message appears, I guess its some hickup in CAN communication. I had these a lot at the beginning of the 3.5 line but the latest versions seemed to have improved that. The best thing would be a popup window telling that "Detection was successful, however, since you run 4.12 hardware you were defaulted to BLDC. If you are sure that your hardware is able to do FOC feel free to switch it, the proper settings were made already"

Sometimes it gives this message. Simply start the wizard again. 

The Motor Wizard is quite simple now and minimises questions noobs can't answer. It's pretty much an autopilot.
Standard is FOC nowadays, but HW4.12 can get damaged if quality is low and if you use funny settings or non ideal motors. So you have to FOC it manually.

yes I understand that and let me just say, the new tool is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much simpler than the old one.  auto connect, firmware update, motor config wizard, input wizard.  Boom, done.  I like it, good for noobs as you say.  It does however set outrageous current settings, which is not noob friendly! 99A/ -99A on a 10S battery is not good

So does the RT logging work now? I could not get it to work in the last version.

Also the mobile tool shows a lot of potential, I like what I see here, with telemetry logging and some tidying up (and that ability to have miles instead of kilometers) and its going to be amazing.

Battery Amps are not so important. For regen you have an Amp limiter built into your thumb and for drain the motor amps are the limiting factor.  
Motor power and battery capabilities should match anyway.

:grin: Exactly my thoughts :D I really appreciate what Ben did when he designed the VESC and is still doing with the Firmware and the Tools BUT I think everything is getting more and more trampa-centered, just like trampa is a puppetmaster or, as I previously was joking, Lord Vetinari.
@trampa You might use overpowered Lipos in your Boards but most of us don't and battery max and min are quite important for us. I for myself know what I'm doing but the new Tool makes it easier for noobs to make bad mistakes. They might even be happy about the wrong settings at first since you get more power, but eg. someone uses dual motors that are capable of 40A according the new detection and has a battery that can do 30A max leads to things go badly wrong. You should care too since you try so hard to bind the VESC(tm) to trampa(tm).

Really nice. Downloaded VESC tool mobile app and connected to my board - Dual Focboxes 4.12 - via Bluetooth. Everything worked fine. Running the newest Firmware now and the app shows everything to me. Also changing profiles now and seeing realtime data is everything I need and did before with metr app.

I really like the info about the driven kilometers of the current trip.

Does anybody know if the VESC (Focboxes or whatever) saves the kilometer (mileage) overall? From the beginning since turned on the first time? I would like to have an odometer about my km/miles altogether, since riding. ... I always liked it in the Boosted or Onewheel app (never had one of these boards), so it would be nice to know how "old" my board is.

If the info is somewhere in the VESC then it should be easy to read it out. Thanks. And keep up the good work, Benjamin.

The VESC itself does not save the overall kilometer because it resets until reboot. Because you say you are also using Metr app. There you can click on your module in the Realtime tab and see all time stats and todays stats.

Here a picture I copied from [this thread.](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/configuration-and-telemetry-for-vesc-ios-android/13483/680?u=hexakopter)

I know this in metr app but it also starts from 0 every time, also in the All Time tab.

I thinks its true, the ESC resets on every reboot. ... A solution would be that the software (app) stores and adds everything together (all trips = km of all time).

No, the "All Time" tab should not reset and does exactly what you are saying, it adds everything together.
If it is not working like it should, make sure you are running the latest Metr app version and Metr Pro firmware version. If you still have problems please send us a mail with the log file to support@metr.at and we will figure it out.

Anyone downgraded to 3.57 from Ackmaniac and noticed horrible throttle response? Prolly some kind of setting that is not correct but I the only thing I could find in app pwm setting that could create a long delay was the median filter and I tried disabling that without having a impact. I use the "micro" style remote in this picture and it's configured as pwm. Works fine on ackmaniac but on 3.57 vesc fw it keeps throttle on for what feels like a second and it also lags getting throttle on. Feels horrible when the board accelerates when I'm hitting the brakes trying to stop it :D

That's not a downgrade, it's an massive update.
The remote is probably calibrated to send a 100+% signal when switched off. You need to change that. Some receivers can be set to give a signal x when connection to remote is lost. This remote is known to send 100% signal if the receiver is not adjusted correctly. That's why it's on my personal dangerous product list.

THX for sharing this! The problem with this kind of failsafe is: If you don't know about it, it can also work in the wrong direction, sending full throttle. For ESK8 it should not be possible to adjust it to positive values in failsafe mode.

The pwm remote is set to 1000 start, 1500 mid 2000max. At failsafe it's going to 1500. It's not a failsafe issue it's when I go off throttle the board keeps going for another second. Really scary in some situations. Think of it as playing online games with 1second ping.

A lot of friends came back to previous FW version after having upgraded to 3.57.
They all complain about the "lack of power" calling this FW "the veal" (in French, this is not used for complimenting :smile: ).

So even if the FW has new awesome features, crazy code lines and so on, the most important is the feeling of the rider. Isn't it ?

And for the 3.57 this is a no-go for most of people, thus keeping them away from new safety features.

If you use the same settings for the motor and battery, there is no difference in power delivery, no matter what FW you use.  Motor amps and Battery amp settings are defining how much power your board will have. 

The RAMPING TIME might be set differently, but that is a quick change in the App settings.

Once the remote is calibrated, you should have a very direct throttle response. 
Try a *Pos Ramping Time* of 0.3 sec.
If you still have a delay, your remote probably has an issue. 
In the input wizard you can see a bar showing the ppm signal. 
Does that react delayed or immediately?


PPM and UART is correct. Otherwise you will have no App connectivity. 
CAN will not slow things down.

A thing I don´t like, when you have a dual motor setup via can-bus.....

When using the wizzard for the setup, the process detects both vesc nicely, and setup both the vesc, with those "random" amps numbers etc., Same goes for the remote setup. BUT here comes something, you have to pay attention to. Until now, the process setup both the vesc. But if you then think, that those motors amps or braking amps, is totally wrong, and change that in the GUI, these new numbers is only changed in the vesc you are connected to via USB. If you are not aware of that, you could have two motors with totally different settings ??? I still dont think this new wizzard, is user friendly at all(the old was Better), specially not for newbees

Oh I managed to solve the problem by accident and now I got it back. I was forced to update the firmware even if I was at 3.57 and lost all my settings. I did motor config again with a medium size outrunner (raptor 2 hubs) and it got all crazy settings like @Pimousse described above. I figured why not try and see how it behaves and it behaved like it should with decent throttle response. 

Then I adjusted my settings and it almost killed me again by not being responsive and stopping to accelerate even if I was braking. What did I set wrong? I swapped from -> to (approx) 
Motor current max : 38A to 70A 
Motor current max brake -38A -70A 
Absolute maximum current 150A to 100A 
Battery current max: 99A to 40A 
Battery current min: -60A to-12A 

Did some more experiments and it seems like if I reduce to motor amps to -40/40 again to match the battery max amps it get responsive again. So am I fighting some kind of PID controller here that's trying to limit my bat max when I got higher motor amp than bat amp setting? I'm pretty sure I had it set like this on Ackmaniac and it worked fine. 

A sidenote here. Why is there no logic what-so-ever on the battery settings? I set 12S Liion battery in the configurator and select 12Ah capacity. With a Samsung 30Q 12S4P you got 4x3Ah so  that should be right? Even if I had a pretty wicked battery outputting more than 20A  like the 30Q let's say 30A/cell it would give me 120A/2 = 60A batmax. The norm however at a 12Ah battery is more like 20A realistic/cell and that's 80A/2 = 40A batmax so why the 99A default and -60 charge?

I don't think so. This is what vedder said a month ago on the vesc forum. It's really confusing as stated by another user above. The wizard is great making the settings equal on both but it's a PITA changing the amp settings back/forth on two vescs like I just had to do when testing now. 

"The capacity value for the battery should actually not be divided. Current and regen should."

The CANed VESC needs to have the motor detection values correct and it needs the matching Motor/Battery current settings.

If you think that settings need an adjustment, simply re-run the wizard and use the advanced/override settings to manipulate the detection. That's usually faster than manually manipulating values on both VESCs. 
Sometimes you want to have non symmetric settings on different VESCs, so changing settings on individual VESCs should be possible. 4WD with non 50/50 power split is one possible example. 

Battery settings don't matter so much. Users worry way to much about that. If you pull a lot of amps for an extended period, voltage sag will happen and that will work against overstraining the battery. Using the Advanced/Override option, you can set Batt limits if needed, as described in the documentation. That's two clicks only. 

Batt Max can be set higher than Motor Max, but you will never pull more than Motor Max. If Motor max is e.g. 50A, 45Amps is realistically the max that will flow from the battery, no matter if you drop in a value of 45A or 1000A for Batt max. If you run two Motors from one Battery, we are talking about max 90A from the battery. A 4p pack from 30Qs can supply 80A continuous and a lot more peak. Also note that a matching fuse for the battery is a requirement for a safe hardware setup. If you pull a lot more than fuse rating, you will blow the fuse on your innitial full power test runs. 

Batt Regen should be set equal to Motor Regen, so that the throttle stick reacts most linear. Braking currents drop very fast with dropping speed, so there is no issue for the battery, unless you ride down a long 45deg incline with full brakes applied at 40km/h + speed. Such a road doesn't exist in reality. The brake should be strong enough to slow you down, and dropping speed always results in rapidly dropping currents. I would worry more about my own life than battery life. Also note that no one will pull full brakes at full speed if brakes are set nice and strong. Full brakes at full speed would send you flying. Thumb = amp limiter. 
Batt Regen is a value your battery will only see for a very short period of time. 30A is the bare minimum I set for Batt Regen for a powerful DIY board.

This is where ackmaniac differs I think regarding the motor max. The voltage to the motor changes atleast in VF control where it's basically linear but also changes in FOC. It's not like you apply 48V to the motor and up the amps slowly. So if you got 30V at the motor and pull 60Amps but your battery is a fully charged 12S do you still pull 60Amps at the battery? On ackmaniac fw I run 70A motor and 40battmax and it's way more powerful then this firmware at 40A motor max 40A batmax like you suggest should be the same since motor amps is limited by my battmax. I can barely get up hills with these settings where I bombed them with ackmaniac fw at same batmax setting.

Are you suggesting not to set battery current limits?  Because that's what it sounds like.  There is no way for the VESC to know the limits of your battery unless you set them, because a VESC can be used with many different batteries.

Just getting up to speed, then losing brakes due to a blown fuse is NOT how to make a safe setup.  You are putting "losing hardware" into a higher importance than "personal injury" and it should be the other way around.  Not getting injured is actually more important than not damaging a battery.

The FWs work the same way. Same settings result in same power output. You can push 80A towards the motor while only 40A flow from the Battery. At 50% duty the motor runs at half battery voltage and can therefore run at twice the battery current. For regen it works the same way, but reversed. 

Power output = voltage * amps, no matter what FW you use. Using higher motor max than Batt max gives you higher power at low duty cycle. However, max output power at full duty cycle is limited by Batt max in that case.

We skate a lot and do test things put at the edge of the components involved. 
Benjamin and I have built a battery test rig to put battery cells to their very limit. 
When looking at the data, you will very fast come to the conclusion that batt settings are not as important as you may think. If your battery pack is matched with desired motor power, worst case is a bit of voltage sag. VESC-Tool has the option to limit Battery Amps, as it always was the case. So if your pack is not matched with your motor power, you can reduce amp flow. 
However, we never managed to blow a 100A fuse, even with no batt limits set and using twin 70A on the motor side. 7KW continous is not happening in real world.

Exactly. This was not what you said In the other reply. Did you then read what I said above? If I set 70 motor amps and 40 batt amps my board with vesc stock firmware becomes a killing machine with sluggish throttle response and throttle not going off until almost a second after I release it. At 40/40 it behaves fine and with ackmaniac 70/40 it's also fine.

Let's assume you empty a 12S8P pack (30Qs) in one hour, high average speed, average draw 25wh/km. That's a 1KWh pack, drained empty in one hour. That's only 12A average amp flow per motor for a twin. Nothing to worry about. Sure, there will be some high spikes and some free rolling. Your battery will stay quite cool at all times. 
That's equal to draining a 12S4P pack in 30 mins. 

We took 10A rated cells and emptied them at a 20A continuous. That's way beyond you would ever see in esk8 application.  

Ever hooked up a temp sensor to the battery pack?
Simply ad a 10K NTC and hook it up to the VESC temp sensor port. Do a crazy flat out ride and monitor cell temp at the end of a hilly section. That experiment will give you an idea how stressed your cells are. 

The Wh/km value is a very good indicator for average amp flow in your system. I guess that your ride style and setup will not stress the battery at all. 

If you are worried about your pack or want to limit voltage sag, or run a battery that is not very capable, VESC Tool offers the option to limit the Amp flow and prevent any spikes exceeding the continous discharge rates of your cells. Simply hit the Advanced/Override tab to set a limit.  Super easy! We describe the procedure in the setup documentation.

At 70A the stator is probably totally saturated. It makes no sense to go beyond the point where the stator is saturated. You can try to find the spot where saturation happens. Pushing a lot of amps through such a motor results in heat, and that will change the resistance of the motor, which affects reliable FOC operation.  People had locking up motors because of heat. It's wise to monitor temperatures and keep them within an acceptable range. 
70A Motor max in another FW doesn't mean the motor will see 70A. Ramping might cause the Amp flow to swell up slowly and in reality your motor only sees 40 to 50A.

I’ve always set my motor max larger than battery max. I mean, at least in earlier releases we had to as running with low duty cycles (less than max speed) we have to increase the amps on the motor to get enough power to accelerate properly. (Or at least I do with my single 6355 and about 15-36 pulleys). 

I don’t have my board where I am, so I can’t test the 70/40 vs 40/40, but I don’t recognize what Trampa is trying to explain. Maybe @Minim should post on the VESC-project website and try to get an answer from Benjamin. Or maybe someone with knowledge of the FOC implementation could shed some light on this?

This is the exact reason why I run 70/40 since I need the torque when starting off the line and doing steep hills while not at full speed. A wild guess here but I don't think I'm alone wanting this. Since I believe that the Engineers at Samsung set their limits for a reason I'm not interested in increasing batt max and shorten the lifespan on my batteries. A better way to solve it is to set the motor amps as high as I can while not saturating the motor and setting batt max as high as the battery can accept. The ackmaniac software takes care of this and makes it smooth atleast I never noticed this bug with that firmware. With vesc original firmware I have the problems mentioned above with sluggish throttle response when going off throttle after full throttle. 

"Also note:  **Symmetric settings**  (Battery Max = Motor Max, Battery Regen = Motor Regen). will give you  **perfect linear negative and positive acceleration.**  No need for funky Watt control modes. The more asymmetric you go, the more you will experience a non linear response. Your battery has to be able to cope with the currents anyway if you want good brakes. You can’t store the generated energy in the UNIVERSE." 

This is from the post you linked  to. I disagree that this is the best solution. Since this post was simplified let's simplify it even more. You got a motor that can deliver peak performance at 60A but your battery can't deliver to the full potential as the speed goes up (lets's say 30A max). The reasons for this can be many (weight, danger ++) but we want the best from what we got right? So If we go by your suggestion above we should lower battmax/motor max down to 30A so we can set 30A motor max and 30A battmax. Do you agreed that we then sacrifice a lot of acceleration/hillclimb potential of this setup? The half motor max is a TON of performance lost that both the motor and the battery could handle within specs. 

Another thing is that when we need power is when we increase speed. If we are cruising at 25-30km/h it's barely using any energy compared to what it does when accelerating from a dead stop or climbing that hill. So the demand for power is often when you have lower duty cycle so there is almost always potential to use more motor amps than batt amps.  

It's also easier to speak in watts here because it is the energy produced we feel at  the weels. We don't feel amps or volts. If I want 2000w at the motor I have to allow for higher amps down low then up top since we can't beat physics.

Exactly what I mean 👍  You are however confusing me with the «40/40»-approach (i.e. equal max settings on motor and battery). I need more motor amps running from standstill than my battery max should be.

Other than that I think @Minim said it well in the last post.

You would simply use 70/70 if you need more motor power. The 70A from the battery will only happen for short periods and in reality your battery will not be under more strain than at a 70/40 setting.

That's because of the average amp flow, which is quite low anyway. 
If you empty a 12S4P in 30 mins, you will have 24A average amp flow only. 
The peaks will be higher for sure, but a 30Q can easily cope with that. They are rated 20A **continuous**. Peaks can be higher. In reality battery Amp settings don't matter so much. 
What matters is average amp flow in reference to battery size and cell rating. 
If that is a high value, you will see more voltage sag, no matter of your settings.

This is getting ridiculous. We need to set battery max to not push our luck with the batteries in our builds if we want max performance from our motors. 

I get that you did some garage test with a thermometer and concluded that the packs could handle it but the engineers at panasonic/samsung/lg ++ set their limits for a reason. I trust them. I might push my luck a little but but I won't set it to almost double of spec like you suggest with upping it from 40 to 70.

Samsung 30Q is rated at 15A continuous btw.

All I'm saying is that battery amp settings are not as critical as a lot of user thinks. Most of the time amp flow is low and most of the time you don't ride at full duty cycle in combination with a high workload. 
Vesc FW allows you to dial in any setting you like. The cooler you run the cells, the better and that has a lot more to do with your ride style than your settings. In reality your cells will only see some more spikes if you dial in higher Amp settings.

@b264, if you look at the equation for motor current(Steady State)  

i_motor = (V_motor - V_bemf)/R_winding = (V_batt * duy_cycle - V_bemf)/R_winding  

Where V_batt is the battery voltage including sag.

It is easy to understand why it is difficult for **i_motor** to be high at high speeds. When the speed is less V_bemf is pretty low and so to have large motor current we just have to bump up the duty_cycle. But when speed, hence duty cycle, is already high enough, the difference between **V_batt * duy_cycle**  and **V_bemf** is small. So the motor current **can't** be as high when compared to lower speed. Hope that made sense.

Try to be more specific. Do you use USB connection, which model VESC, or is it a clone?
Does the other unit connect without issues?
Did you try another cable. Some USB cables are charge only cables.

Thanks for the reply. I’m using a USB connection and it connects fine to the other VESC. It’s the VESC 6 and I ordered the whole board pre built about a week ago (order 16415). When I plugged in my batteries only one wheel spun up but I verified that both VESCs have power with my volt meter. I then tried using the USB but it wasn’t working with the one VESC. Just flashing blue rapidly. Was there anything else that needed to be done out of the box? 

Thanks,
Tim

I have been going back and forth on fw, the phone connected and said an update was needed, ok no problem, go to hook to laptop and get fw to new and not compatible, odd but ok backwards I go. Then try to update laptop and server must be down. Connect to phone again and another update. Why make it where the app auto updates but not the laptop version? I didn’t tell my phone to update anything and it HAS to be connected to WiFi because it’s just for the app alone. 
Very odd setting though, I put that new fw on and my board was VERY docile compared to what it was. I couldn’t go near full throttle before, after “update” I could easily hit full throttle. I even had no worries putting friends on it that hadn’t rode one yet, on a machine that took me a few rides to get somewhat comfy on. I think I have it set up loads better now after getting settings off of a similar setup. Still feel there is some more power hidden away though hahah

You need to reach out to David garlinge.
David.garlinge at trampaboards dot com

If one VESC doesn't connect we have two options: 

a) Use the working VESC to re-flash the non 
working one. We call that SWD PROG.
b) Swap the unit to a new one. 

You can try SWD Prog first. Interconnect both VESCs via SWD Port (IO to IO, CLK to CLK and GND to GND only!). Cable no longer than 8cm.
Power up both VESCs, connect to working VESC via USB. 
Open SWD PROG menu, hit connect, select VESC 6, click upload. Wait till device is flashed and give it some extra time. Now your VESC should work again.

Benjamin also has a Video about that procedure online. Search for his YouTube channel (Benjamin Vedder).

You can update the FW via the Phone App. No need to use a laptop. If you hit "upload all", both VESC will get the latest FW. After update, you need to re-run the Wizards.

Can anyone help me out setting up my new motors.
Pretty new with the vesc tool and it got overwhelming really quick.
Wasnt sure what size motor to pick so went with medium since everyone seems to use that.
Then i got the numbers for motor max at 35.59 and -35.59.
Why so low? Is it my battery? 
I have tb direct drives 90kv. (Running a generic 10s5p 396wh battery. Not sure of cells.dont think its 30q.dont know what bms is in it either.)

Her are results after setup.
Would like to tweak it cause in mode 1 and 2 i couldn't even go up my driveway. Mode 3 i was able but lets just say my ownboard goes up faster without problems even in mode 1.
So yeah....would need help.

Motor amps and battery amps work together to produce torque, so I advise better to find out what's the cell specs of the battery is first then the guys here can give more solid advice :slight_smile:

Just go for the settings that VESC-Tool suggests. You can up the Motor Amps a bit if you like. 
The suggested settings will drive the motor with less heat. The higher you go, the more heat issues you will get.  All hub motors suffer from a vicious circle when it comes to overheating. The efficiency is very poor on those and inefficiency always goes into heat. It really depends on your weight, speed, hill climb etc. 
When you overstress the Battery, you will see noticeable voltage sag. In that case you can reduce Battery Amps to a point where voltage sag is less of a problem. 
If you have a discharge BMS in your pack, you want to limit Batt Amps below the BMS capabilities. If you run two motors, you have to adjust both ESCs by using CAN Forward. You also need to divide numbers by two.

First of I love the while VESC project and all the time you and Benjamin is putting into it but I also wonder if there is a interest to use the knowledge of the community, there are developers and UX designers that could help push this to a even greater project if we all worked together.

From what I have read it more seems as Benjamin might want to continue to have it as his own project, I might be totally wrong here.

Feature request should be handled in a voting style if it's users that can't contribute but have ideas, easy to do with free services online and user could have three votes to vote for features. Users that are developers should make feature branches from the project repository and have them reviewed and merged when approved.

The tools UX is ok, it works but they need major overhauls. Design proposals should be made and implemented when the have been approved. They just serve a basic purpose with alot of inconsistence and soley done from a technical view.

This is of course if there is a joint interest in doing this from all involved parties. If not, totally fine and keep up the good work  but would be great to iterate faster together 🙂🍻

Hi Frank, 

I seem to have some issues running dual-VESC 6 with the new Wand! 

After updating firmware on both VESC, running the entire motor set-up, and pairing with the Wand - it's seems like only the master VESC, is able to run with cruise control, whereas the slave-VESC just kinda keeps accelerating up to Max RPM (slower or faster depending on the CC setting)! The master keeps CC speed just fine, and adds additional torque if the load is increased - the slave just stops if any load is added while in CC mode.  
It's as if it doesn't recognizes the input sent over the CAN from the Master Vesc! 
I've tried to reconfigure and reinstall firmware on both VESC now for the past 5 hours, but nothing I've done has made it work.
In addition, for some reason, i can't connect via CAN from the master VESC! it keeps telling the 2 VESC's are running different versions of firmware though both of em runs 3.61, and none of em are missing the bootloader.

EDIT: I found your previous post about closing and re-opening the VESC tool, which has given access to the CAN connection from the master as well! But it still didn't fix the cruise control problem :-)

Do you have any ideas of what could be happening? 
Cheers!

CC can only be tested under load. Bench tests will not give you any results. Please use a profile with limited speed and power when trying out new hardware setups.

Benjamin will look into it anyways, so there is a good chance that a 3.62FW is out tomorrow.

I've tried different settings while testing CC now!
I've had it out in the parking lot, driving up and down the ramp, and had it running in the living room on the treadmill, to see if it would differ! But the problem seems the same. 

While running up-hill in CC my right motor with the master connected get's quite hot compared to the left motor run by the slave.
So cruising up-hill at 6 km/h will overheat the master's motor quite a lot compared to the slave, and the slave won't do much work. Going up-hill full throttle and both engines works equally together. 

On the mill as well, the motor connected to the slave-Vesc doesn't seem to do much pulling, unless you manually give it a fair amount of juice, at which point it catches up to the master! 
It just seem to rev up the slave to maximum motor RPM regards the amount of throttle given, at which the throttle only adjusts the amount of pull given out by that motor - kinda like the old maytech remote seemed to work. 6 km/h in CC can't engage the treadmill on the lowest resistance setting on the slave - the master will just truck it out, no problem, even on high resistance. 


I'll just have to pick the board apart again, and i can try to take some video of what's happening if i ain't making proper sense in writing it down :)
