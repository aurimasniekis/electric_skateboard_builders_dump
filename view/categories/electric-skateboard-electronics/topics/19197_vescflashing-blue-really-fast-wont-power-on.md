blue light is for the power... if it flicker, it is because you don't have enough power for your vesc... as @blasto said your pack is probably [spoiler]Fucked[/spoiler]

Any fault codes? Do you own a multimeter to check your battery?

The vesc does not even have time to power up, no fault code to be read

if it's turning on whilst being charged you will be able to see the fault code (say if it is lack of power) as the moment you unplug it will rapidly drop in voltage and output "low voltage" error code.

@Goo-shtick, read my last post in your other thread. Follow @Namasaki's advice on how to check your individual cell voltages. They should not be under 2.5V
