Hi guys. Just finishing up my build. Had a few test rides. I have:

Turning sk3-6354 motor 260kv
8s3p (hodgepodge of free 18650 batteries)
Entertion VESC fw 2.18
Sparkless 120a on/off switch
Torqueboards mini 2.4 Ghz remote controller
Enertion trucks and pulley
83mm wheels

The problem is I can't get the torque everyone talks about, nor the top end. I can get up to about 15 mph. This seems very low. One calculator said I should get up to 33 mph (no load). With load, I should be north of 25 mph. 

I'll post my VESC settings when I can, but anything I should zoom in on?  I'd like to enjoy it without investing more $$$ at this time. 

I know the batteries could be questionable. If I replace them, what should I consider for about 10-12 mile range in an 8s set up?

You should all ready be around the 10 mile mark with the 8s3p. I'm sure the torque has to do with either the battery no supplying enough amps or some VESC settings are wrong.

Yeah 8s3p is not going to get you enough power. Figure you are going to get a max of 5 amps per cell,  at 8s3p that is less than 500 watts.

I kinda semi disagree I'm running a 6s lipo and I got more than enough torque. Don't get me wrong it's not a smooth start but I can go up some long steep hills. 

But I'm sure you know a bit more about eboads then me.. just my opinion

Edit: unless lipo's are different then liion

chaka is saying that the 18650's have way too low of a discharge rate because they're most likely laptop batteries. Low discharge rate leads to underwhelming wattage.

I wanted to provide a complete picture with full disclosure. That's why I mentioned the mix of li-ion batteries. However, the same lot supplied batteries to a different custom 6s2p using an RC ESC. It is torquey and faaaast. 

When I can, I'll post BLDC tools screens. I'm hoping some adjustments can help.

when your vesc is connected, on the app tab ppm config, do you see the display bar do it's full swing (hit the max and min of the bar)

could be a mechanical issue where your belt is to tight, or my last guess is your batteries are not able to output enough current

I don't know the math for ur 260kv motor and the max erpm but I think u might be able to go 12s and just limit the erpm.  That way u can keep the vesc cooler and the battery happier. I'd figure if that's possible first. 
  There are so many different batteries u could get.  Just assume everything is half its stated c rating.

I get 20 real miles on 8ah and 12s.  Not sure what nominal voltage is 12a but I like to call it 50v..so 400watthours.   That's like 200watthours to 10 miles

Cheap is hobbyking

Idk if you guys noticed, the first battery was li ion and not lipo cells. So that was an obvious no power when its only 8S3P as 3 parallels li ion could only discharge max around 30A constant which is very poor.

But its good that Chaka noticed it I suppose. Get high discharge / setup more parallels / more capacity and you're good to go.

20A you think this constant as a constant? Not sure. You at least about 4p to get a nice torque start. Its easy to tell the difference between high amps setup compared to low amps setup. If your maths is right, eboard shouldnt pull more than 10-20A if you are gentle with throttle. Try to do 2p if that would make a difference, pretty sure it will dissapoint you.

The thing is that these motors on eboard could pull alot of amps although the amount of amps required are not so much. However the more "ready" amps you can deliver, it just burst all the way. General conception of electricity is that you can't never have too much amps. Your load decides.

For what is worth I'm getting 27mph on full charge 9s lipo. Torqueboards 230kv (they are actually 190-200kv chaka said) 15/36 gearing with 90mm abecs. I also tried 12s but limited the erpm to 60,000 (can reach 67,000) and got 31mph, but should achieve around 36 on full charge.

I am about 195lbs and I can pull around 2000 watts on a powerful system accelerating from zero. 

2000/8s-28.8v=70amps

If you want this kind of power from common 18650's then you need at least 7 cells in parrallel, even at this size it will lack punch due to excessive voltage sag. In my experience common laptop grade cells will burst to 10 amps for short periods but high discharge 20amp cells will give you much more punch due to the lower resistance when only asked to output 10amps per cell.

Something to keep in mind is that the vesc feels like it has a mind of its own. Like I was max throttle going 30mph and I was about to stand up from a tuck motioning thats all you got because I wanted faster. Next thing you know the vesc kicks into to high gear ("turbo") and all my weight gets shifted to my back foot and I almost ate shit but thankfully I didn't. I put my hand on my chest the whole ride because I was so shaken up.

This might be due to mismatched motor and battery max. Could also be due to low voltage management, the vesc will throttle back if the voltage dips and it will come back once the voltage rises again after acceleration. Same goes for temp management.

Wouldn't it be the RPM sweet spot where the motor accelerates a little on its own? But i do know I'm to heavy for a single because sometimes it doesn't want to go any faster than around 15mph or climb a slight hill I think I hit the temp start cutoff.

Batteries for sure.  some of those laptop batteries probably only give 2-5A and starve your ESC of power.  

I have those Zippy 4s 8Ah batteries - run them regularly on GF's single motor Vanguard.  Work great and get good mileage.

Mileage - best way to estimate is to figure out Watt Hours (Wh).  Take your Voltage x Ah = Wh.

So your example Zippy cells - 4s (3.7v nominal = 14.8v) in series (x2) = 29.6v x 8Ah = 236.8Wh.  You should roughly expect 1km per 10Wh.  So approx 23.6km/14.6mi.  On the flats - not racing, and not being a big rider.  All those will decrease range, but it's still a good estimate on paper when planning battery size.

The problem was on my end in part because I was going to stand up and at the same time the boost kicked in. I've learned to always stay in tuck when using vesc and going fast.

---
## \#48 Posted by: chaka Posted at: 2016-08-15T17:51:14.907Z Reads: 167

```
Another thing that could be happening is the voltage will come back from sagging after accelerating and increase the top speed due to the relationship between kv and voltage.

Edit: More I think about this the more sure i am that this is what is happening. I distinctly remember looking down at my voltage display in a tuck and seeing my voltage rise and feeling the slight boost in top end. 

I would be willing to guess that a pack with more voltage sag would result in a more apparent boost after leveling out at the top speed or cruising speed.

I think that sounds about right two of my lipo packs aren't in the greatest condition. I'm going to build a 18650 pack soon.

Is it possible that the vesc went over the set max erpm limit I set in bldc tool?

Multiply your kv by your nominal voltage and if you are under 8600rpm you should be fine. I like a little more buffer for the occasional dh session but it is only a real danger if you release the throttle and let the motor spin freely beyond the maximum voltage/rpm

The Zippy's have a BMS already in each pack, right?  So what charger do you use?  What is your top speed?  

I'm at a little under 190lbs and my build goals were 10-12 miles (check) and around 25mph top cruising speed (I calculate 24.94mph weighted-- check?).

Nope - no BMS.  You need a regular Lipo charger.  On a budget and want simple - i recommend a iMax B6ACv2 - has AC-DC Power supply inside for one plug simplicity.  If you want ability to charge more than 5 Amps - and don't mind some complexity (or can use for other RC hobbies) - check out the iCharger chargers (206b/306b).  I have the 306b w/ dual dell server power supplies for 24v 1500w.  

To charge multiple batteries - a simple parallel board.  Helps to occasionally charge individually.

Speed is all in the gearing.  Not having her board in front of me, i'm not positive of motor gear, but likely:

83mm wheels - 200kv motor - 8s - 14/36 = 21mph.  She tops out at around 8mph realistically, but i do ride it every once in a while and it moves along fine w/ me on it (265lbs).

I usually gear for 25mph on my builds (single or dual motor).  8-10s usually and love running 97mm wheels for rough roads (or unattended small children).  I gear as low as i can w/ the larger wheels and higher voltage on 190-200kv setups.  Run some gear calculators and you should do fine.  Don't go below 13t on the motor on 9mm belts - it will skip.  I might not go below 14t on a single, or go at least 12mm or 15mm wide belts.

GL!

@chaka @devin I keep my ERPM pretty low and my Real-world (and anecdotal) experience has been that if I approach or exceed that limit and apply throttle, I just continue to coast. I can hear VESC engaging but it never presents a "braking" effect if I'm beyond ERPM and apply more throttle. I forget which parameter it is in BLDC Tool, but I believe that this behavior is the default.

@treenutter Thats the parameter. When it is disabled then it simply shuts off the VESC. When it is enabled it brakes when it exceeds the MAX ERPM.

@Ackmaniac Ahhh thanks for the reminder. This makes sense to me now... I use FOC mode so I think that this parameter does not engage in the current firmware when in FOC mode. Hence, I haven't experienced negative torque when exceeding the ERPM. I'm sure there are many other variables that apply, as @devin notes above.

Funny that you mentioned it. I checked the FOC code and i can't find a limitation of the max ERPM. So it seems that the only limitation is the soft ERPM limit from the application. That could be a bit risky if that value is not set and you run the board on the bench with a 200kv motor and a 12S battery. Because then you get above 60000 ERPM. 

So you should make sure that the soft ERPM limit is set in the application to prevent that.
It's also a bit strange that Vedder didn't implement that.

`App Configuration`  --> `PPM` --> `PID max ERPM` to limit the ERPM to 60k?!

That would be only for PID speed control. You need to set the App Configuration --> PPM --> Soft RPM Limit --> ERPM limit start and ERPM limit end. But if you run the VESC via the keyboard in BLDC-Tool you could reach higher speeds than 60000 ERPM. 
But it depends on the motors kv and the batterys voltage. With a 190kv motor and a 12S Battery you should be careful. But maybe it also doesn't really hurt the VESC when it is above 60000 ERPM. Who knows?

Hello Chaka,

I have made a 8s3p battery pack made from new VTC5 18650 cells. Voltage is 37V fully charged but max speed is 25kmh and it feels really weak.. Range is also not great. Can you think of what went wrong?

Well it would seem you have well over charged your batteries the max voltage per cell is 4.2v what you have said suggests you have charged the cells to 4.6v which is way to high

Pat is right, those cells are being over charged at 37v. 

Still, 8s3p is crazy small for an electric skateboard when using 18650 cells. If you want good torque you need a lot of cells. 60 cells seems to be the starting point if you want something that will be powerful throughout the discharge cycle.

I get good results with my 8s5p packs, but I use new cells.

Thats a big jump from 8s3p, you will still get a good deal of voltage sag during acceleration or hill climbing. And when our voltage sags we lose power, less watts. The absolute best setup I have tried is a 10s6p with sanyo 20700 cells. Like I have a freight train pushing me.  Hill climbing at speed is where the big packs shine since we are asking for more amps and running around 80 to 90% duty cycle.

True! I meant as a minimum for 8s should be 5p.
