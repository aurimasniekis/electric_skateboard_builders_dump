Would need pics to really help from the forum but the v4 is the one with the solid clamp.  If you hit up @torqueboards he can send you the two piece clamp which locks on nice and tight.  Mine stay tight if you lock them on good 
watch this vid

The key is to lock the clamp against the square profile of the truck hard so tighten up the opposite screws first.
If its an alignment issue which it sounds like then the only way is to slowly revolve the wheel and pulley and tighten up each screw at the apex of the movement until they straighten up.  You must have at least 2mm between everything too.  Once they are set up well they are great mounts.  Mine are still tight and have done some miles too.  Is yours a dual set up or single?
