Hello for anyone who wants to help that would be amazing if not, I understand. I have downloaded bldc tool for windows and if will not run any firmware at all or pick up any default settings.

I tried uploading the 4.12 default firmware, would not load and have it connected to everything needed obviously. I feel like there were things in my command prompt that I needed to change, I have only used the link given to downlaod the bldc itself for windows.

"Refreshed your pin"? Does the VESC currently have f/w on it? Are you plugged in via mini USB? Do the lights turn on?

Did you make sure the USB cable has data pins? Some cables only supply power.
