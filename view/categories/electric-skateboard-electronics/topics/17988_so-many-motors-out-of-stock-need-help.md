I had a Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5065-236kv Brushless Outrunner Motor but the holes warped and it couldent be fixed, I returned it and they said they dont have any of the motors left. What other motors would be similar to this one? One where I wouldent have to get new parts. Thank you!

Would this work with the Enertion Space Cell Pro 4 10S4P ?

Yes, 10s is the recommended voltage!

These are better motors than SK3's as well. They are specifically designed for E-skate and you won't have a problem with the holes warping!
236kv is too high for 10s with vesc anyway. 190kv is the standard for 10s with Vesc for reliability

I'm not comfortable selling the motors I have mow. I would need to get more in stock, which could be 3 weeks.

i would much prefer sensored but if you have an sk3 you can sell me lying around that would be baller

No you don't have to, but if you want the same speed as before you will need at 16t motor or 40t to wheel Pulley.

I don't have any, but a few do:

[Sk3 6374](http://www.ebay.com/itm/262000907892)
[SAITE 6374](http://www.ebay.com/itm/281810835128)
[SAITE 6374](http://www.ebay.com/itm/252746609088)

Unsensored - I think it's worth the wait for sensored (diyelectricskateboard mid march) if you plan to run BLDC.  If you run FOC, then unsensored is fine.

since i'm running a really high voltage, its safer to go with BLDC, right?

Delivery can be 3-4 weeks and the package is likely to get lost if I ship via USPS (FedEx and UPS are way to expensive). Total would be about $28 shipping

Thanks @JLabs! I'm getting the itch to build now pretty bad so might have to find something more local. Your motors do look bloody beautiful though! üòç

I just got the motor, and the holes arent even close to to matched up. I cant even get two of the holes lined up.

What mount are you using? I stated the mounting hole pattern. [quote="JLabs, post:2, topic:17988"]
30 and 44mm mounting holes

I guess I didnt check before because I asked what motor would be identical to the one that I posted. It is 25mm holes with 6mm shaft. What motor mount and gear set would work with your motor?
```

## \#23 Posted by: JLabs Posted at: 2017-02-23T21:04:32.513Z Reads: 60

Any standard mount from DIY, Enertion, etc. I'm not to sure where you picked one up with 25mm mounting holes, and a 6mm bored Pulley..
***
I don't think there are any vendors that offer a motor identical to that. I was just trying to provide another option. Sorry if there was miscommunication on my part.

The motor Pulley will work, but I'm unsure about the motor mount spacing as it is not specified. The Pulley is also 3M, not commonly used in DIY, and it ships from HongKong.

@jesser722 are you looking for a mount with 25mm measured in a square pattern or X pattern - I may have one if you are still looking or can have one made if you dont mind waiting a week and a half.  Are you here in the US.
