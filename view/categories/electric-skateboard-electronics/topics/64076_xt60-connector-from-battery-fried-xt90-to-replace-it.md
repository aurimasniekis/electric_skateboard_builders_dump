Skateboard was still working when I took this apart, but I'm glad I took it apart before things got much worse!!

XT60 from the battery was getting hot... It came stock with the 60... Should I replace it with an XT90?? Or could there be a worst underlying issue other than a bad connection?.. I don't believe the wire was soldered to the connector... Just crimped on.

No issues switching.  I do see thin wires from the burn side but the lipo should come with wire that can handle the current.

If it was crimped the heat is being generated from not enough wire contacting the connector.
