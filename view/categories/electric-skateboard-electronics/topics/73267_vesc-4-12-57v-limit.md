Hi, i have been running my brushless scooter on 14s for about a month now with no problems. 
Today i recieved a bluetooth module and proceeded to install it and set it up, i couldnt get it to work but had flashed my board with new firmware. Now it wont let me set it to 59v where as i could before. Does anyone know how to disable this cant remember if i did something before

Are you talking about a Vesc limit or something because of Bluetooth

I experienced this when I upgraded my firmware. Now max voltage is set to 57. You need to use the “no hardware limits” version to go higher.
