I have a set of Jacob hubs for sale 125.00.  I bought the sleeve fix to the rubber getting warm and spinning around the motor. I havenâ€™t had to us it after a year or so riding but have them just in case. It has been a great board for me and the girls but moved to SoCal and traffic is too crazy to ride any distance. 

I am will I get to sell the deck and cover but not the vescs.
