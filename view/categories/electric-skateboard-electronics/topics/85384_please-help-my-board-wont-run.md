I'm about to go out with my dog to the local park and I do a quick pulse on the remote and it spins fine. I put the board on the ground and kick off and doesn't go I thought it was just a loose connection inside so I switch it off and leave it at home. The build is this one just new motor and wheels and has been working fine since November. this is it  - https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/esk8-build-to-get-to-school/75385 -

Here are some problems I've already checked this afternoon. 
- no loose connections
- no VESC faults

We need more information. Do your vesc turn on? Do you battery output a voltage?
