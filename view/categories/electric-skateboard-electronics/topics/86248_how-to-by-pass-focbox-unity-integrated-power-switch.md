Hey guys,

I have a Torque Boards 12S4P battery (The TB battery has everything integrated) and dual 6355 motors and I need a way to by pass the integrated power switch in the FocBox Unity. Is there a way? Besides doing a push to start.

Thanks!

Unplug it and turn auto shutdown off in the software?

You have to short the pins on the unity so it is in always on mode. Then you can add your loop key.
 If you have nothing pluged in to the switch port of the unity it will always be off no matter what you do. You have to make a cable and short the pins.

Make the jst cable on the right and plug that into the switch plug to connect the pins.
