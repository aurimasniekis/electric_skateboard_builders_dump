At a buddies vape shop and a box came in

Vapes use individual cells not cells that are built into a larger battery like our boards. They may guarantee individual cell use but once you start spot welding them I'm sure they won't cover anything.

Maybe with a nese compression pack would work cause the cells are not modified at all.
