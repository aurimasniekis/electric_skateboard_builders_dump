i was just wandering if its safe to use 270kv motor with an 8s battery because the motor might stop working when im going full throttle due to a really high rpm

You can use any kv with any battery. You only run into problems with the VESC because there is an erpm limit. I think 270kv on 8s is too high, just limit the erpm to 60,000 (I think that's it, I'd have a pro confirm tho)

```
60000erpm/7=8571 rpm
8s x 4.2v= 33.6v
8571/33.6=255kv
230kv or 245kv would work.
