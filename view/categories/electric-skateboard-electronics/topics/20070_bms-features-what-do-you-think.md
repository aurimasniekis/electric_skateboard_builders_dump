What do you think about the features

Seems like I can only use it for charging but does it have a good balancing function?

I'd generally stay away from these. The quality just isn't there. I would not trust this for a set and forget system

The balance current of this BMS is low (40 mA) and so the brick may shut off before balancing happens (which means you may as well not get a BMS). What brick are you using to charge?

No idea what charger the spacecells come with. To be frank though, I don't think you'll find a BMS anywhere in that price range that balances well.
