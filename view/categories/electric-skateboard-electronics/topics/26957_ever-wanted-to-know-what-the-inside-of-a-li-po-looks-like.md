Batteries were unfortunately dragged on the ground after detaching from my board and most of the corner of this one wore away. The fact that it did not catch fire immediately is amazing. Yippee for cheap Chinese lipos i guess, next time I will do a better job mounting them.

Discharge it with a halogen globe or some similar load until its at 0 volts. Then it should be safe.

We cant see a lot here but inside is a bunch of very thin layers soaked in a liquid electrolyte.
