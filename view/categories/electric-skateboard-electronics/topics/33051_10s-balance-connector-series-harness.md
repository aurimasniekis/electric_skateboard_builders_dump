Hi. I'm looking for a 2x 5s to 10s series harness for the balance connectors. Or help with how to wire them myself, I can't figure that out... Also looking for a 2x 4s to 8s version. :slight_smile:
Thanks!

Since I canâ€™t find any for cheap, I might as well wire them myself... 
Any inputs on this diagram? Should be just like that right? 
Thanks

No need for the middle black wire, if your mains are already connected in series. It does nothing but increase your chances of shorting your battery pack if hooked up incorrectly
