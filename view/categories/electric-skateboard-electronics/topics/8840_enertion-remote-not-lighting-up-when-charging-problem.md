My enertion remote is no longer lighting up when plugged in. Other than that, the remote works fine (I rode the board since noticing the issue). My concern is that it may not be charging, or that even if it is charging, how do I know when it is full?

Please help me and thank you.

Might need to contact Enertin support. Thats not right. Although do the other 2 lights at button end work ie red when peering. When the right goes amber it needs charging. Without that light at charging you wont know of its fully charged or not. Hence why it probably needs replacing.
