So my 2 VESCs are almost to big to fit in my enclosure. To not have the cables from the motors go into the side of the enclosure they need to be kind of stacked on top of each other. Is that ok or can it cause a short circuit? I attached a photo of how the will lay.

If you take care that everything is properly insulated sure. I'd extent the cables though ;)

Yeah to extend the cables sounds like the best solution! Do you know any guide on how to do that?
