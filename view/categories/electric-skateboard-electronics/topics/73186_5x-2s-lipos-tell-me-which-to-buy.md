I've been waiting for over 2 months for the 5000mah 2s Lipos that were $21 on sale to come in stock.  Well I give up.  Batteries are the last item I need, to finish project.

Can anyone recommend a 2s battery that will not break the bank, reliable C rating of 30+, enough ah to last?

My goal was to spend under $100, as I need 5 2s batteries.  I already have the 10s lipo BMS and 2s sensor wire extensions waiting.  I would consider 2x 5s batteries but afraid not enough clearance for bottom mount.

You can flat out bigger packs if you know how.

Yea, I'm going to avoid breaking down lipos for my first build.  Though it's always a thought.

I think with 100$ it’s going to be hard to find 5x 2s lipos with good c-rating. I wouldn’t go under 5000mAh. Most are around 30-40$ with good c-rating. Just search on hobbyking they have a good choice there.
If you still have some patience thsn you could wait Black Friday. Last year there where many good deals with lipos.

My favorite lipo brands are:
* Turnigy Nanotech or Graphene
* China Hobby Line
* Tattu

You can get away with using cheapo Multistars if you run more than one in parallel, only using a single motor and can program your VESC to limit amperage.
