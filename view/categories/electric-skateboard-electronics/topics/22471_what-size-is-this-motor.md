The motor is listed as a 63mm Motor but the printing on the motor says 5335. But it's mounted on a 63mm mount. I have ordered a 6374 from @Kaly and want to be sure I don't need a different mount.

It's not so much the size of the motor as it is the mounting hole spacing you need to worry about.
Different 63mm motors can have different mounting hole patterns/spacing.

5335 is a measurement of something else, I believe it was stator size, and maybe something else.

Not sure why it says 5335 right above
D:63 mm and L: 64 mm
Because that would be a 6364... Right?
If you have calipers you should measure it yourself just to know.

Does @Kaly know the dimensions of the mounting screw holes?

Don't worry for the motor mounting holes 
My motors have doble holes, so can be use with any esk8 mount you choose.

Wow, those are nice looking motors. I'd be tempted to pick them up if they had sensors.

Thank you for the compliment, but it is a practical matter. 
I like to use others vendors parts and sometimes it get complicated. This is a little something to ease that.
