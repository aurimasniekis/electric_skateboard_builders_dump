So I am trying to program my vesc with the BLDC-tool and I entered all my values correctly and when I press "start detection" under Motor configuraton>BLDC the motor jolts a little then I get an error message saying "Port disconnected."  I noticed that even if I turn the motor by hand I get the same "Port disconnected" message.  I was wondering if anyone else had this problem and what I might be able to do

Did you hit connect first on the right COM port and did it say connected successfully?

Is it possible the vibrations are disconnecting the vesc? What vesc is it?

no because the motor barely even spins like it just gives a quick jolt and that's it.  its the vesc from torque boards
