I shorted the electrics on my board, so not sure whether the BMS is working... so have to un-solder things so that I can isolate the battery & BMS & charging port (laptop style), so that I can charge the battery...

I'm going on holiday next week Sat, for two weeks, and it's been sitting as is for about 2 weeks. When it was shorted, it was just above the threshold for a 7s Lipo, so it was due a charge.

So - question is: how long would it hold that charge for, or have I lost it already?

thanks!

Lipos hold their charge pretty long:
