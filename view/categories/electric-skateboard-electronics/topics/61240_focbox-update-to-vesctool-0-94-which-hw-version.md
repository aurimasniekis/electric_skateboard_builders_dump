Hi all,

Recently I bought two FOCboxes from Unikboards ([link](https://www.unikboards.com/fr/boutique/focbox-motor-controller/) but they are shipped with an older firmware. I can use them with the old BLDC tool but I want to flash them with more up to date firmware and use them with the 'new' user friendlier vesc tool. Before I can update them via the vesc tool I have to select the correct hardware version. However, I am not sure which to select. After some digging my best guess is it is HW version 4.12 however it remains a guess. Could some please clarify which hardware version is used within the FOCBOX? 

Kind regards,

Job
