Hi I am on the finish stages of my build, programming my VESC. I tried multiple times and watched lots of videos on it but still can’t get it to work. I was wondering if there is any way that anybody could program it for me, thanks.

People can guide you, physically programing it for you requires the person having access to your build

I didn’t word it right in the text above, I’ve tried programming it but I would just rather have someone that knows how to do it 100 percent so I don’t want to ruin my VESC

something like teamviewer would work fine for this kind of situation.  If you can post screenshots of the 5 important BLDC tool tabs it would be fairly simple to outline the changes you need to make, after you do the motor detection on the BLDC and FOC tabs.

The 5 tabs...

* Motor Config > Motor
* Motor Config > BLDC
* Motor Config > FOC
* App Config > General
* App Config > PPM

nope.  discord can do it all.  if you enable screen sharing on discord and join the voice chat, itll be just like facetime except, instead of your face, itll be your screen!

I've got an issue too with programming my vesc too, I can't connect it to my computer, when I try, it says connected for 2/3 seconds and then it says no firmware read response and then not connected, any help is good, but if someone had the same problem, I'd like to know he got through

Hello everyone! I am at the final stage of my board but ran into a problem. I built a 10s2p battery out of Samsung 30q batteries. (The same one Mike beard did but with 30q instead of 25r).
I'm not sure how to calculate the max amp out and max regen for the board and was wondering if someone could help me out? Side note I have the torque boards 190kv motor and I'm pretty sure I put the numbers in right but if anyone has one or knows what they put or would put in there's please let me know. (Please don't rip on me I'm a noob :slight_smile: )![MSW_10_Current%20limits_set|690x370](upload://7mYpb5FccYdwpOVUnNeD501NE2l.jpg)

100 motor amps....or you can do whatever up to that, probabaly don't need that much though
40 battery amps .....you have only 2p and those cells are said to be good to 20amps each
the negative motor I think you can also do whatever suits
negative battery you can do up to ..I think 16 ..I think those cells are rated to 8amps charge rate each but not remembering.   you could probably go over their stated peak charge rate as you wouldn't be doing it long anyway

The motor is rated for max 80amps so wouldn't putting it at 100 blow it?

 temp decides amp limit alone.  i dont know why they write such things.  also the voltage you can put in is only limited by the insulation on the magnet wire which is surely in the hundreds.  the temp limit is decided by the magnets and at what point they lose their strength permanently and it's likely not stated what magnets you have so a mystery.  electrical resistance goes up with heat so better to be stay cool anyway, be more efficient.
