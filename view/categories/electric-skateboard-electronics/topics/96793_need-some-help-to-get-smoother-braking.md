Hi, i love my new build and everything except my brakes works as i would like it to. I was wondering if anyone could help me with understading the VESC tool a little more so i could change it! Rigth now my brakes kick in at 100% if i move the throttle a little making it very hard to smoothly brake. Im not very experienced in the VESC, but i could imagine there is like a ramp up setting. :D
