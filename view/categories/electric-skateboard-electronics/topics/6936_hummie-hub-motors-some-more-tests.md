Oh man, you guys are on it.  I just finished uploading that last night and went to sleep.  The motors are whisper quiet and once you push off they have plenty of torque.  I don't have the traction control wired up just yet, they're just Y-connected in parallel for now.  No issues, stayed plenty cool, and I only used 1700mAh to go 3 miles. So by my rough estimate, I should be able to go about 5-6 miles and still have about 25% battery reserve.
