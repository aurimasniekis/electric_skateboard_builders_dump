Hello,

I plan on using this BMS:
http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-37v-42v-10s-60a-10x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-267.html

First off from what I have been reading I think I am okay using a 10s BMS for a 9s setup? Also if i am going to use a 9s LIPO setup what kind of charger should i use? 9s or 10s? 

Does anyone have a link to a diagram with a charging port setup? 

Thanks!!!!!! 

FIRST POST BTW.

You'll be fine, you will not use pin 10, that's all. Charge only with 9s (37.8V output) charger.

It's right there on the web page you linked to. No change but you don't have the battery on the pin 9-10.

Would it work with this BMS as well?

Yes, BesTech would also work. Same conditions apply.

Just wondering if you were able to get the 10s bms to work with a 9s battery?    I also have a 10s bms that I want to use  for 9s battery.  I only need the bms for charge only.

But if the BMS overcharge protection kicks in it doesn't really matter if you use a 10s charger right?
Bestech BMS are typically build for up to 12s but are only missing some parts/connections to function as a 12s
