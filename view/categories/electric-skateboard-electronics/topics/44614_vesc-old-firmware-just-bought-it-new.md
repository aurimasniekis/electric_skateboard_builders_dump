Yeah, I bought a VESC from them in November and I had to update it too. No big deal though, I used VESC Tool and it went fine.

Is your computer detecting the VESC ?
Go to the Connection tab (in the left menu). Refresh the list and see if a COM port has appeared.
On my computer, it's listed as COM 3
