Can I use this 120A MAXI  fuse on Vedder's anti-spark switch 1.3?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/a/dabbd996905a9df9f5e12bd4c44d9c1926924cd2.jpg" width="374" height="499">

As long you can connect the ends of the fuse to the spark switch you are fine. I doubt you will need a 120 amp fuse. I use a 50 amp fuse and have yet to break it.
