Does anyone know where I can find a power switch for a 12s1p battery pack with a female USB port for charging stuff?
I've seen this on battery packs. Is the USB a feature on the BMS or is it something I can add in line with a power switch?

Hmm. I havnt seen anyone do this recently on the forum. I could suppose you could use a UBEC.. I may have a fuzzy feeling @longhairedboy knows himself of knows someone who knows.

That looks really promising.  Use part 2 to step down voltage, and the USB charges up to 2.1 amps (long term vs 3a rating)?

Alternatively a cheap HK ubec would work, but still be more $.

let us know how it goes!  I might do similar and get a spare or two w/ an easy to swap connector...  at these prices it's easy enough to have one in the box for just in case!

I'll report back how it works, however that could take a good amount of time, cause parts arrive from china slowly 1-2months, and it's just for my 2nd board. So i'm not in hurry to finish this :slight_smile:

Don't know about your leds, maybe link them and tell us how many leds one meter has^^ for sure it is enough to charge my remote or phone and thats all i want.

I got a 5a buck module that's sealed in plastic package with mounting holes. Should work fine. You can add another small bag or voltage regulator like the super mini 3a version you can for about $1 and use this to get down to 5v. Solder a usb port or 2and your set.

Those rgb strips use about 1a/meter, but that will be crazy bright on the bottom of a board. I'm going to use about 50cm on my board and that seem like plenty.
The rest of the power goes to a pair of 3w leds with lens.

i actually used my lab power supply to test the full roll (15') of 5050 single color LEDs and it was around 1.8A max.  So you should be fine with only 6ft/2m!

I can grab my 5050 rgb's and test as well, but i'm positive you are fine w/ 3a.

Nice!  One thing to note, most of the 5050 LED's are 12v not 5-6v so just make sure you get the right ones for a UBEC to power like @Oriol360 linked.  You can find the lower voltage LEDs which take ~6v, but confirm or go 12v to power them.

Safety alert - not all buck converters use authentic components.  This is more of an issue at higher voltages, but beware that some may overheat and or catch fire. If your LEDs flicker of fade weirdly. The buck converter is failing to provide a smooth current.  You should disengage it asap.

Look for YouTube reviews for an up to date list of authentic buck converters.

And to back up what @KMeyerson shared....

Always test the converter before you hard wire it in....

I had the same experience with a similar converter...These do come from China after all 

So use a voltage meter!

Yes, but 1 or 2 Amps is used for phone charging.
Maybe it will work, but generate extra heat on your vesc, which is what you dont want.

You guys have some great ideas going, but I thought I could just say a couple things to benefit this. First off DONT EVER trust the "3A Max" rating a component and think, well then I can draw 3A fine! Like may be you can draw 3A... if its liquid oxygen cooled, but definitely not with normal air cooling. Now that's not always true but in my experience, it has been. I often use the same buck converter that Nordle was talking about in his PART 2 and I was recently working on a project drawing 1.5A at 12V and it overheated in about 10 seconds. But the thankfully I had 5A converter and I used that instead, though that thing still gets relatively warm drawing 1.5A. All I'm saying is be careful and air on the side of caution. And also you can buy a pack of 5 of those converters on eBay for $5 though I'm sure there not legitimate versions though they do work for smaller projects.

Totally depends on how much current the EL converter uses. If it only draws like an amp or two you may be fine with that blue buck converter (don't remember the chip name) though you may also want to use that HRD converter instead.

i looked at the turnigy dlux hv sbec for my purposes but it doesn't do 12V output according to the page on hobby king, and the el inverters i bought are are 12v. 

I just emailed the people i bought them from to ask about amp draw. That's not something i thought about. I figured it would be pretty low, but i'm sure that's a mistake in the making, so i thought i'd check to be sure.

damn they're fast! They emailed me back already. The draw is less than 300mA so i think we're good. I got a couple of the BECs linked in this thread from ebay and one i found on amazon to try out and see which works out best.  In the mean time i have a shitload of drawing and dremelling to do on one particular deck. Don't worry, build thread will come. That board is going to be epic.

@longhairedboy if you are using el wire the amp draw is so low....

If you run a separate line from the the battery to a step down, you isolate the lights in their own system...anything goes wrong with the lights ...just turn them off.

I've used dual 10w LEDs for headlights and LEDs hooked up to this

I could totally use that on my 6S rat board as is. My son has already taken it upon himself to cover the whole thing in LEDs powered by the BECs on the Favourites its currently running. 

my plan for this build is to have a small kill switch on the lights but also have that wired in after the main switch so when the lights are in the on position, they just come on when the board is on and go off when the board is off so that it doesn't drain the pack and trip the BMS protections if accidentally left on for no reason, becuse it can't be accidentally left on.

Yeah any voltage higher than 6s need to use a higher rated converter like the one I mentioned earlier in the post.

Trying to get the VESC to provide power to a lighting system is not the best idea...

The safest is just to run a seperste system...again if any issues...just switch it off...it will isolate the LEDs from the power

i burned out 6 LEDs doing exactly that. It is indeed a terrible idea. You really can't count on that 12v line to do more than power the receiver and the led in one of those angel-eye push buttons, which is something i've done in the past with much success instead of getting an additional BEC to do it.

Yeah like Nordle was saying I  just put a drop of hot glue on the screw so it won't vibrate to a different voltage lol. Oh and also you guys were planning on using 24V USB charging modules, though those then must have there own step down module on board which is less efficient and may make the board more expensive. So you could just get a 5V USB module and adjust the converter down to 5V so its more efficient and cheaper.

EDIT: I've used these modules in the past and they work super well and output right around 1.5-2A i know there's cheaper ones out there but all I know is these ones have worked well for me. http://m.ebay.com/itm/DC-DC-3V-3-3V-3-7V-4-2V-to-5V-USB-1A-2A-Step-Up-Vehicle-Power-Charge-Module-YG-/111866440588?txnId=1528632132001

Hey Nordle just to let you know, I can't find a datasheet for a "LM2596HVS" and if there isn't a datasheet for the chip, it's probably fake or just a re-labelled LM2596. Also there are some videos about fake HV LM regulators so do be careful. I wish there were 60V versions of the LM2596 but I don't believe there are, though I could be wrong so test it out and please report back with whether or not it works!

EDIT: I still can't find a LM2596HV chip, though I did find a LM2576HV chip which can take up to 60V. Here's the datasheet, and it would be a great chip for a 3A UBEC which I may build in the future. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm2576.pdf&ved=0ahUKEwjdgbH1ttPOAhWRsh4KHSMFDGcQFggkMAA&usg=AFQjCNF7FcxJ3UzAUT6_FkqXNu4P5YedbQ&sig2=qIEe0Ph7qyrDCfFdvAJcaw

Hi Guys,

Read through the whole thread here and am trying to make sure I understand it all.  I'm planning on doing a 10S or 12S build next and wanted to have a USB charging port.

As far as I understand these are my options:
1) Buy something like this with input voltage of 5V and use power from a BEC that can go from 12S to 5V

http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Dual-USB-5V-1A-2-1A-Mobile-Power-Bank-18650-Battery-Charger-PCB-For-Phone-DIY-/171404149586

2) Buy something like this, that takes input voltage from 6-24V and use with a 12S to 12V BEC.  The advantage of this is that I can then power other things like lights with the 12V BEC if it has enough amps.

http://www.ebay.com/itm/6-24V-12V-24V-to-5V-3A-CAR-USB-Charger-Module-DC-Buck-step-down-Converter-DIY-/221980647793

3) Instead of a BEC buy a DC to DC Buck Converter like below and then buy one of the USB modules linked in 1 & 2.  For some of those Buck Converters can you select the exact output voltage? How does that work?

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DC-DC-Converter-Adjustable-Power-Supply-DC-DC-Step-Down-3A-LM2596HVS-LM2596HV-DC-Step-Down/32485142548.html?spm=2114.13010208.99999999.288.U9QBas
