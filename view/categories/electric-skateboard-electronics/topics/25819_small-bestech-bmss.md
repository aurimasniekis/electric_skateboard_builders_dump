I ordered some small BMS's (for balancing only) since my build is pretty cramped for room. They look great and are spec'd for exactly what I need. Good option for the space conscious builder. Specs are exactly the same for both BMS's so I only included one.

@Jinra - you are READING my mind!  I just got my 10s and 12s 80A BMS'ssss  They are pretty frickin' huge.  I'd love a super small 10s and 12s BMS just for charging when i build an 18650 pack!

Any suggestions on similar small 12s BMS?

Whatever you choose make sure theres a value for "balance", some don't have balancing.

Have you had any issues with your BMSs from Bestech? I just tried both and neither go higher than 40.7v on my 10s setup.

One time because I replaced 1 pack that got a broken wire and the new pack was too far out of balance from the rest. 
I manually balanced all five packs separately with my hobby charger and it's been fine ever since.

A beginers question...... So you use BMS only while charging and than drawing directly from battery while riding?

## \#10 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-06-21T13:42:20.233Z Reads: 298

```
There are 2 options. 
You can use a bms for charging only or for charging and discharging.   
The 2nd option is the best because it protects the battery while riding as well as charging.

## \#11 Posted by: Vieo Posted at: 2017-06-21T13:44:39.060Z Reads: 294

```
From what I gather, alternatively you can also draw power via the BMS _(requires a high Amp output)_ and this can help with safety; eg. monitoring each cell in a battery pack to ensure isn't over-discharged.

[BMS - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_management_system)

I believe these BMS in discussion are for charge-only setups

Thanks guys! As I thought... BMS used for charging only, can be smaller and cheaper. If cells are balanced while charging and I plan to use VESC so I can limit a curent, it should be quite safe system, right? I have SONY VTC5 cells and I want to build 10s4p pack to power one 6374 170KV motor.
And I read on some ebike forum that you should wait after charging because BMS is still balancing the cells. Is that true?
thanks
Luke

All my cells are 4.04-4.07v with a total charge of 40.6v on 10s. Both my 42.2v chargers won't charge anymore than that.

Weird thing is the problem exists on both BMSs

## \#14 Posted by: Vieo Posted at: 2017-06-21T14:48:13.161Z Reads: 271

After looking at the BMS data-sheet

**Over Charge Release Voltage:** 4.05V

Maybe this?

While the number is about right, this is the release voltage and not the overcharge detection voltage (4.2 on sheet). They said they test every module before shipping so i don't know.

Guys, noob question here. If I have an 8s4p pack, do I need 4 BMS's?

If not, how does it work with just one BMS and 4 'packs' in parallel?

---
## \#20 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-06-21T15:43:58.918Z Reads: 263

```
I think the problem in your case is the charger.
If your using a brick charger, I believe the charger turns itself off when it detects what it thinks is full charge. 
I'm using a power supply with my bms's and it doesn't shut off, it just slowly reduces current to the battery until the cells are full. 
I think the brick chargers, especially the cheap 2a models are just not dependable
```

## \#21 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2017-06-21T15:48:35.240Z Reads: 259

I have two chargers that both output 42.2v. Also my BMS (that doesn't balance) charged to full.

@darkkevind You only need 1 BMS, and yes you treat each parallel group as 1 cell.

>I think the brick chargers, especially the cheap 2a models are just not dependable

I think in the case of brick chargers, charging is entirely dependent on the BMS. The charger only thinks it's full because the BMS is blocking any more current from flowing. I'm sure this is how all commercial boards are built as well. I'm guessing my BMS's are just duds, or the overcharge release is somehow affecting charging behavior

[/quote]


No just one 8s BMS.  The 4p is seen as a single larger cell and charges as one.  each group in parallel gets the single balance lead to BMS - regardless if 1, 2, or 10p.

so for simple math - 25R in 4p is seen as 1 10,000mAh cell not 4 x 2500 mAh cells - per balance lead.  As expected when you charge 2500mAh vs 10,000mAh - it'll charge slower the larger the capacity.

HTH - GL!

That may be true for some BMS's but it is a good idea to let the battery cool down after charging for 20-30 minutes before using it and vice versa don't charge a hot battery pack immediately after using it.

These look lif like a good small, inexpensive solution. But that shipping cost is pretty steep. Maybe someone can set up a group buy for these and we can all save on shipping.

Those are tiny! My 12s 80amp bms is like 200mm long and 120mm wide! Well, not the actual bms but the sheet of metal it's attached to, by the way is it safe to drill through that metal? It looks like just a normal sheet of aluminium, might actually be a heat sink, I don't know

Can you use an 10s or 12s BMS on an 8s pack? You just don't connect up the extra wires right? It'll still charge and discharge each cell to the correct voltage won't it?

@Jinra 
did you have to order two from them or do they allow only one? I recall they put their lowest limit on 2 products but not sure.

EDIT: I did notice they are adjustable aswell as there seem to be different variants of the BMS with different overcharge voltages. Maybe you got the wrong one or voltage is just set low?

FOLLOWUP:

Turns out you actually **need** to solder on B- on the BMS. I thought the B- from the balance lead would be sufficient, but apparently not. My pack now charges to 42v with a ~.7v cell deviation at the highest.
```

---
## \#44 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-06-27T11:34:14.287Z Reads: 191

Yes, for bypassing (not recommended) you still need to connect the battery's negative  main to B- 
But you don't use the P- except for negative charge wire unless the bms has a separate pad for charge C- in which case you don't use the P- at all

I'll definitely find a use for the one i got (80A discharge so big w/ heatsink), but would like small if i'm going to build into a thin board...

For the folks who know - is there a supower 12s that's also small and bypass?  Or is bestech the way to go?

If 10 amps is the amount of current you want to draw from the battery then yeah that should be fine, that would mean your motors will be getting 10 amps max, on 8s that's only 296 watts of power.. being such a low current though you're not going to have any trouble with over heating I'm pretty sure

Hi, I am looking for a small BMS just for charging...I have found [this](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/10S-37V-16A-Li-ion-Lithium-Battery-BMS-PCB-PCM-Board-For-Ebike-Electric-Bicycle-/352104358559?hash=item51fb0e229f:g:LrYAAOSwyltZWh6h) one on ebay, is it okay? Does anyone have experience with it?

I am quite limited by space, because I will be using split enclosures and I dont know how to charge...I dont want to remove the enclosures everytime to charge like I did so far...should I bypass small BMS, buy normal one and use it even for charging (I would have to lead balance wires under the grip tape to the enclosure with VESC) or find some multi pin connector and use BMS outside the board (12 pin would be enough in case of 10S, 1 pin would be empty)

Any advice is welcome :)
