I am fairly new to the ESK8 community and I am working on building my first board.  I am having a hard time deciding what battery size/how much battery power to get?

I am looking for a 20+ mile range. Can anyone give me suggestions or point me in the right direction.

Thanks for reading this. I could really use some help.
