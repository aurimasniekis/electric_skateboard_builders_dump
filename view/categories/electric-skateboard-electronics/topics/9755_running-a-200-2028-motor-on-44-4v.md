So right now I'm running a 6374 with the vesc and 4 batterys all in parilell and I was going real quick I think around 40 but I haven't been able to speed test it yet because my belt started sliping bc I didn't use the baring on the gear from enershen but after I broke that I got the truck cut and i am just waiting on the new belt and remote, but my question was could I buy the 2028 motor and use that with the vesc because it has all the same mounting as my old motor, I want it to go like 50-60 so I can go on a 45mph road to school and be passing cars let me know what you think, thanks

50-60? MPH? :scream:

Also what 2028 motor are you talking about? Sounds awkwardly small

Search 2028 motor iv only seen one person use this on a board, he was going 55 and only running 12v<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/3/4378a9d253d972916a82bcd9abf725a84a2aed47.jpg" width="600" height="405">

The motor can is almost 8 inches.

Will that fit between the wheels without limiting turning?

ok that is anything but small. But at 60mph esk8ing on a regular "to school" level is just asking for serious injuires.

maybe can use two motor mounts to hold it in place. 

is it 800 kv?

Right now I'm using a 190kv but that motor I'm talking about is 800kv, I'm running 4  11.1 zippy in parilel so 44.4v but it will charge more than that so more like 56v the gear is the 12mm wide belt from enershen with there wheel gear and I have 97mm flywheels from abec but there old af so I ordered nock off $20 97mm flywheels

I'd say it won't be effecient because of erpm limits on vesc 4.12 (read the above thread for more info).

Prepare for some serious heat...
I can't imagine the motor or esc staying cool enough to touch with a setup like that.

Basically the higher the kV, the lower the voltage you can throw at it. Some good scenarios: 10s 190kV, 6s 270kV.

I think you mean series because parallel would be 12v total. Don't charge to 56v it's 4.2 volt max (50.4). I don't think the vesc will be able to supply enough Amps for such a high kv. Maybe change motor pulley to higher teegth(20t). I hope you're wearing full face helmet and full leathers because you're going to get us all banned from the road if you go down. Personally i think you're putting to much faith in your electronics that can fail at any moment.

stay with that 190kv motor and supply it with 12s. Slap a 16t pulley on the motor and a 32t on your 97fly. After that put 3 helmets and a spacesuit on and rocket at 45mph through the streets :monkey:

and of course provide us with a video :D

for sience!

But first of all watch @RunPlayBack s "Session Error"

Yeah i know what you mean my setup goes about 35mph and it doesn't feel terribly fast but I don't trust my electronics to go faster like the motor could lock up or you can have a remote failure and you just have to much momentum to stop and idk how to slide just foot stop. You shouldn't charge past 4.2 volts per cell or you'll very likely burn your battery or even your house down if you're unlucky. If you have single motor I think dual motors will give you a adrenaline rush you might be after I can barely stay on my board. And if you still decide to go faster with dual(change motor pulleys), you'll still have a lot of torque to back it up

That's probably what I'm gonna do I have my motor mount welded to Paris trucks and it's kinda sketchy bc they get wobbles any tips to avoid that (the time I smashed on it the hanger cups where super destroyed so it wobbled way easier but I already fixed it)

We use the castle 2028 in our large scale rc boats. They pull huge amps. The esc's we use are Swordfish 240 amp pro plus's with data logging. The power is disgusting. :astonished: I think it's 10hp. It can drain  10s 5000mah battery in about 4-5minutes. Boats are a different story though with the drag on the water. There must be way more efficient higher kv outrunners capable of giving you what you want. At those speeds it becomes very hard to walk away if you eat it.

I think you guys are making this harder than it needs to be tbh. With my carvon v2's, I have hit 38 mph with way more throttle room left. 

My no load speed with 97mm wheels at 12s is 75 mph, and 63 mph at 85% efficiency, and 53 mph at 70% efficiency.

Those speeds are insane, but really, that's all you need to do if you want high speeds. This guy who used this long motor did so in a time when hubs and vescs did not exist. He was using standard rc technology. But we have better stuff now. I wouldn't trust my life at those speeds with an rc esc...

That motor at 800kv is so high that regardless of what voltage ur running the amount of amps necessary to get the torque/inductance you need it will shut down the vesc very quickly. Even on22 volts you'll still need like a 200amp esc.

the esk8 speed record is just below 60 (59.somethiin) So i really doubt youre going to make it there on a commuter board.

you have to remember esk8 is not an efficient form of flying :upside_down:
just going from 20mph to 30mph takes almost twice the power, to get past 40 you'll need more than just a bigger motor, you'll need bigger everything! 

40 is too fast already, keep what you have. 190kv on 12s is about the fastest a vesc can handle, maybe get 97 or 107mm wheels if you really want more speed.

I mean I already got to 40 I'm pretty sure and I got bigger wheels and ordered bigger motor gear so I'm pretty sure I can hit 50+

He set every esc he tried on fire. He also had to push up to about 12mph or stay on a downhill. This is a horrible motor choice. You could hit 50-60mph on 8s with a 300kv motor and proper gearing without all of the fires. By the way, he was running 8s with the castle xl2 esc not 12v.

The XL2 esc by castle can handle 150a continuous and 200a burst. You wouldn't even need to desolder your drv chip at those Amps. It would be gone. Both hubs (carvon) and VESC's (vedder) existed during Jays attempts at the speed record. He wasn't interested in trying anything else though. I offered to let him try a board that I had with a 290kv motor and an XL2 but he never responded. Funny thing is, that board was faster than his.

Good luck, but stay safe.

I feel like you need to keep up with the flow of traffic at times, which can be 35 - 40 mph. Of course, it depends on the roads. If I'm going to do 35+ mph on a road, I always scope it out first and do a few passes at 25 or so mph. I have a route to my university that I have done at least 300 times now. I know the road conditions anywhere on that route by photographic memory. I know exactly where the roads are good and where they go down in quality. I'd imagine you'd do the same with downhill long boarding. You'd be crazy to blindly do 35+ mph with out knowing the road conditions. If you can rule that potential issue out, and you are very stable at doing 25 mph, going up to 35 mph is not too far. Once 35 mph feels slow, you work your way up to 40 mph and so on. I'm up to 30 mph constantly comfortable now, peaks around 35-40 mph at times. I hope to get to the 35-40 mph range constant.

Where did you get that gear from and how did you mount the other gear on the speed vent, and if I run both those on my 190kv 24s setup what kinda speeds am I looking at

I had the wheelhub CnC'd and then I made the 32t pulley using cast resin and a silicone mold. It was expensive and too complicated to make more than one set up. Mind if I ask how you are going to run 24s on a longboard? That would be 100v. Not sure I've seen an outrunner that can handle that kind of voltage that would fit on a board. 

Data says you'd be capable of 106mph. That is on paper though. Wind and aerodynamics would make that number impossible. Also, I know from experience that the speedvents weren't that durable. Mine had pieces flying off of them at one point.

thats the castle creations mamba monster. i use those for my 15 lb. battle bots weapon.you will go stupid fast if you can get it to start. it also takes over 200 amps at max stall and has 2,200 kv and runs up to a 6s. ya i have puffed some battery's with this one.
