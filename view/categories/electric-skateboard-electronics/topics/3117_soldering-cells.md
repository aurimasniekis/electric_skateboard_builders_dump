Due to a recent increase in diyers making their own battery packs i thought it was time to start a thread on what are the ideal tools for soldering a pack and also When it comes to how you join the cells why not use copper wire vs nickel considering copper is the most conductive.

it was a weller station, I forget the model.. it was a good one. 5mm tip and a lot of heat close to 400c
the packs will explode long before my soldering comes undone.

I don't solder my cells. I spot weld them because despite using incredible amounts of heat in extremely short bursts, it actually keeps the cells cooler than soldering would, especially if you only do one tack at a time per cell and make multiple passes across multiple cells to get the multiple tacks per cell in place. It's also hella quicker. 

But spot welding (and investing in a spot welder) is really only practical if you plan on making packs all the time, so this is a great thread to have. And for mechanical stress, soldering is likely a much stronger bond. Your pack should never see that kind of mechanical stress though. They shouldn't see any at all really. They should be packed snugly in a box all cozy. 

also soldering on nickel strips is an utter dream when it comes to adding in the balance and mains leads. i use a 75 watt iron.

Back in my RC 1/10th scale Car racing days, I would solder Nicad cells together with gold plated bars that I got at the local hobby store. I used a Weller 300 watt pistol grip soldering gun. It worked very well.

got a 100W soldering iron, been spending some time yesterday enforcing 8mm nickel strips with AWG10. Kinda works, just takes lots of time and lots of solder. Just finished half the pieces I need. 

Might pass by the warehouse tonight and buy some copper welding rods to use instead though, they are 2x2mm pure copper, hope they are able to handle 60A, but besides they would be much more effortless to use.

Those copper welding rods work fine, I used them yesterday to solder a 10s/3p pack. They also  increase stability.

You are probably right. I have only been using pre-build lipo's.. I just think that these lipo's is VERY cheap and also very slim so you have the opportunity to make a ultra slim board. 

Do you think it is possible to build a 18650 battery pack around the same price?

no but now i want to. with the right bms and a single drive system with only one vesc you could bury 12 of these directly in a 9ply deck along with all the electronics. add some hub motors and its total stealth.

Hey @longhairedboy when you bury these cells in a deck, taking out material means the board is more flexible, is that a concern? and how much can you safely take (depth)?
thanks

on a 9-ply deck i would say 2-ply and it depends how much surface area is shaved, but if its not your whole deck flex should be really low or non-existent

i could cut pretty damn deep if i cover the whole thing back over in cf twill. I could  for instance bury the cells all the way into the deck and CF over them, then just worry about making a tiny removable cover for the vesc compartment which may also house the bms and receiver. then cover the top in CF too for added strength.

it would suck if one of the cells went dead though.

plus the probelem with a 18650 pack is u have to use more and more cells to get the power but increase ur chances of a short, and decrease the life cycle of your li ions. Lifepo4 however is a relatively safe chemistry. Will last 1-2 years on average and during those years will still hold a good charge and provide good power. Also u only need 1 or 2p with the 26650s

Lipo all the way for me.
although I found its cheaper to pull apart a pack and re assemble it than buy individual cells.

I don't know how complicated it is to cover a board with carbon fiber. I am thinking that fiber glass is easier? I might be wrong though.. Fiber glass adds a lot of strength to the board though (again, I don't know if fiber glass adds more strength..)!

@OskarCastrone  Its not complicated to cover a board with carbon fiber.  Fiberglass and Carbon Fiber each have their advantages.  They can be applied to your deck in much the same way. Generally speaking, fiberglass is cheap and allows considerable flex (when compared to carbon fiber) and if you put a couple of layers of 'glass over your deck it will stiffen it, but it will allow flex (e.g. like with snowboards and skis).  Carbon fiber is much lighter but more expensive and if you put it on your deck, it wont allow much flex at all. If you bend carbon fiber like you would to fiberglass, it is likely to snap or shatter.   

The big drawback with carbon fiber is if you want the weave to look pretty, and to take advantage of carbon fiber's physical properties, there is usually a lot of prep work and careful sanding required. If you want to do this well, you'll need to do some research into the accessories for applying carbon fiber. 

I suggest you do a forum search for "carbon fiber". There are few threads I'm sure you'd would be interested in reading.

Now, lets get this thread back to back to Soldering cells :slight_smile:

I used 400°C soldering Iron and copper braid. Sanded cells before soldering and had really no issues. 3-4 sec per cell is fine some took a bit longer but they weren't too warm at the end when iI touched them.

I would say, there isnt any single nickel strip that will support the continuous current for reasonably sized batteries. but you can get around that problem with your battery layout - for example I build a trampa battery that has 6 nickel strips as serial connections (from each of the parallel pack cells is a connection going to the next). in that case, you dont need to reinforce, but if you have a single strip carrying the full serial load, it wont work. basically the last nickel strip of my trampa battery has to carry that load - thats why I reinforced the last + and - parallel row:

AI'm just about to assemble an 8s3p pack. The only copper brazing rods I can find are at Canadian Tire. 

http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/copper-brazing-rods-3-pk-0580044p.html

They are listed as copper phosphorus with flux. Are these any good? My thought was to try 12g household wire or 12g multi strand silicone wire. I also have 8g and 10g silicone as well. 
Thanks for any advice.

Edit: Couldn't wait. I used 12g solid wire rated for 220v and 45amps. The button side negative was the easy side. The flat positive side (A123's are bass-ackwards) was a pain in the ass. My Hakko 888 had a hard time with the positive side. I'm headed out later to grab a nice butane powered iron to try and finish these up and maybe reflow a few ugly ones.
