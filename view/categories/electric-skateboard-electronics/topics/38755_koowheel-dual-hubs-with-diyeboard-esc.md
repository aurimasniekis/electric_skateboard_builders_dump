So my koowheel esc stopped working after riding in light rain. I just got my dual hub esc from diyeboard.com for 10s setup and hooked it up without the sensors attached since I needed a 5wire sensor adaptor. Koowheel has 6wires for their sensor so I can't connect yet. Anyways it works ok for a preprogrammed esc. Using 10s2p, top speed around 17mph and i weigh 180. I'll probly buy their hubs in the future since their setup has a claimed 24mph. Only problem I have is it cuts off after going full throttle for too long and takes a few seconds to link back up. Scary going my down hill, definitely gotta brake check yourself going downhill just to make sure you are still connected. Overall for the price you cant beat it at $88 shipped.
