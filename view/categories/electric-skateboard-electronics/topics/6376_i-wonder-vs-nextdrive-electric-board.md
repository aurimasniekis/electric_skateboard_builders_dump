is this 9S or 10S?

This was sold als Fiik Spine with 9 cell 33V 7Ah with LiFePo4.
But the alibaba specs say 36V Lithium-Ion wich I think may be wrong.

I think fiik will have them in Stock around August for $1600 aud. No one has tested an I-wonder. I wanted to get my hands on one but they don't reply to emails.

I recently bought what was called the category 5 from Electric Academy for $1200 bucks! I should have known it was just a China board that they were middle Manning. My battery pack shorted out the second time I rode it, and the company refuses to honor my warranty, since they know they are in the wrong. I need to know how to stop the short or get a new vesc so the batteries burn up again.
