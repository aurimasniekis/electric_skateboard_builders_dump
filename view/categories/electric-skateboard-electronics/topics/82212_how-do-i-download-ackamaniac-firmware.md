I’m a good esk8 builder but I suck with computers. I have a Torqueboards Vesc with 3.34 firmware and I’m trying I upgrade it it ackamanic and use the BT module from bkb. How do I go about updating it and what Vesc tool do I use? I have searched but cannot find any tutorials on updating the Vesc. My computer is windows

download this and once your done, extract file and then go into it and you should see a folder called **{ACKMANIAC_ESC_TOOL_3_103}**
open it and then find the **ACKMANIAC-ESC-Tool.exe** and run that, it should look like this ![27|690x388](upload://XRzawy5d3i51srMnebCpv7OPBS.png)

```
Plug in your vesc and go into firmware tab and select the version you want and hit the **update firmware to vesc** button ![76|690x388](upload://tTcpxyyvEokAQh2YMmiXwLmNPkk.png)
