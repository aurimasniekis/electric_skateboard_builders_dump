I don’t have the Vesc 6, but I just plugged my module in, turned on the board, and opened the app.  

What exactly is the problem?

I’m sorry I do not know about the Vesc 6.  Maybe try researching at Vesc-project.com site.  It seems more geared to Vesc 6.

ok so you should be fine just doing everything described in the Ackmaniac app thread for configuration.

Other than that, you´ll find help here:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-version-2-1-ios-eskate-vesc-app-for-standard-and-ackmaniac-fw/32340

If you did configure everything the right way and it´s still not working, you might have a bad hm-10 module.

You have the right module and it´s still funny? Maybe contact @emmaanuel.

Hi,
Most of connection problem can be solved verifying:
- your vesc app is in « ppm and UART » mode
- your vesc uart speed is the same between your Bluetooth module and your VESC (usually 9600 or 115200 bauds)

Let me know if this fix your problem.

So I just transferred to an iPhone 8 from android. Had Ackmaniac’s firmware and app working there just fine. 

Just bought your app but don’t seem to know what to do. I’ve tried to choose the Bluetooth module but I don’t see it. Do I connect via the phone’s settings for Bluetooth or only through the app like Ackmaniac’s?  

Any ideas/guides to follow here?
