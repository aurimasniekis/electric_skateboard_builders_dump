Hello all, 
I'v purchased a Zippy 8s 5,800mAh Lipo from Hobbyking, https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-compact-5800mah-8s-25c-lipo-pack.html, and this BMS, https://hobbyking.com/en_us/8s-li-ion-pcm-charge-5a-discharge-15a.html, but can't figure out how to wire the balance wires together.  The battery comes with 2(4s) plugs for a total of 10 pins, while the BMS has 9 pins but 8 are used in the schematic, https://hobbyking.com/media/file/845847974X4580138X26.pdf.

Do I get rid of the red wire in the middle, connect the first red to the charge port and connect the negatives to the BMS, or connect the middle + and - together while connecting everything else in order?

Cheers,
Malik R.
