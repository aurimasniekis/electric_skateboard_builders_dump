When it comes to building your own electric skateboard you get to decide how it performs. So do you need two motors or is one enough?

Having 2 motors is amazing when everything works perfectly. I've personally found it easier to maintain a solid rig using 1 63mm motor. Especially if it's your first build, or you only have one board. A single 63 with an 8s lipo battery will achieve 6-8hp. That's plenty of torque to climb hills or power you to speeds in excess of 40mph. Also, you'll only need 1 ESC, 1 motor mount, 1 set of pulleys, and 1 belt. 

All of that said, a more complex build with 2, maybe even 4 motors, is fun to ride and always great to see.

I remember planning my first ever build... I really wanted dual motors but just couldn't afford it. It was going to be about $300 more to setup dual drive VS a single drive.. 

In the end I was lucky enough to buy some second hand spare parts at a pretty good deal which allowed me to build a dual drive within the budget I had set. 

To this day I have never built a single motor board. I have however ridden my dual drive with one motor disconnected (due to it shorting out & catching fire) and it felt way too slow :sleeping: ..... I think you get addicted to the huge torque of a Dual Drive :japanese_ogre: ...

But it is also worth noting that I was only running 50mm motors, the NTM 5060 Propdrives...SO a bit small for me considering I weight 95kg. So I think if you are going to build a single motor board you definitely want to go with 63mm motors and as big/long as you can physically fit onto your board. I think Minimum 6354mm Size motors for single motor boards.

But it also depends on your weight, if you weight 50 or 60kg you could probably easily get away with smaller motors. 

my mantra these days is OVER ENGINEER EVERYTHING!

This is the main question everyone asks. I always recommend dual motors especially when going uphill. More then anything it's less stress on one motor and always much easier on the motors going uphill which equals a much less chance of repairing your setup. This allow users to make much more mistakes on their setup (Ex. Wrong gearing ratio, heavier rider, etc.) I'm able to effectively climb hills in San Francisco with a 20-35% incline. Sometimes, the inclines and hills I ride up are pretty scary to ride in the first place.

However, I also suggest a single motor setup for mainly flat ground as it's much less stress than climbing hills.

I think it also depends on the type of wheels and also terrain you plan on riding. For instance if you are building a board and plan to use pneumatic wheels and maybe ride on long grass or dirt trails I definitely think you want dual drive. 

**Pneumatics wheels don't roll as efficiently as Urethane, so you need more torque!** 

There are two ways to get more torque, change your gearing ratio at the cost of top speed - which you can supplement with higher voltage, or add more motors.

I think it is also worth noting that the handling performance of your board will also be impacted by your motor set-up. If you do just have a single big motor you might have some torque steering issues during acceleration & braking.

Maybe some evolve riders should give some feedback.. I have heard several evolve owners talk about torque steering being an issue.

But once again if you weigh 50kg its still probably not an issue as one motor has less load to push.

i have a dual drive system and i'm pretty addicted to the torque and top end speed you can get from having twin motors. Not to mention the benefits of added braking power. I've done some experimenting on my 6S board and have run it with 245s and 270s, and have run single and dual drives. 

I'm not the biggest guy, so i can probably get a little further than some on the same setup. Despite that, here are my findings on 245s and 270s in single and dual configs on a 6S board that weighs about 18 pounds on its own with both motors and 155-160 pound guy riding it:

**Enertion 245kv in dual motor config:** 
Torquey as all hell. I failed to notice hills, acorns, sticks, small children, dogs, or even transition dips in sidewalks. I felt them in my wheels, sure, but the motors didn't seem to care what was goingon, they just kept pumping out power. Top end got me up to about 27-28mph on flats. Crusising at 15 to 18mph was very comfortable and smooth. Braking is nice and stiff, so watch it. 

**NTM Propdrive 270kv in a dual motor config:** 
Just a barely noticeable drop in launch torque over the 245s, and i mean barely noticable. However, they do run hotter, so they may not last quite as long overall if pushed hard consistently over time.  Also they aren't keyed so they're somewhat inconvenient to build with. And they cog harder so push starting is not as fluid as the Enertion 245s. They really shine on the top end though. I'm currently using them and have achieved speeds above 31mph. Braking is still nice and stiff. 

**Enertion 245kv in single motor config:**
Still pretty torquey, but a noticeable drop in launch Gs. I have to admit riding around on just one of these wasn't bad at all. Of course it didn't quite conquer the hills with the same rage ad prejudice the dual set up did, but it got me there in a manner i was good with. And just cruising on flats and sidewalks at a sane speed was every bit as pleasant. When one of the motors failed during a more restrained casual cruise, i barely noticed it. The other one picked up the slack and i didn't realize anything was wrong until braking, which is not all that stiff on one 245. top speed on a single 245 for me was around 25-26mph. I noticed more torque-braking than torque-steering, per se, but there was a little bit of the steering issue as well. But once you get used to it, its not so bad. 

**NTM Propdrive 270kv in a single motor config:** 
You can really feel that second motor missing during take off. Once you get going though, acceleration gets a little more of its oomph back, but not much. Casual cruising is decent and pretty similar to the 245s. Top end was around 27mph for me. Braking was mushy and slow and you could again feel the steering being affected by it. But overall, still pleasant.

Nah all 50mm.

the NTM propdrives are 50mm, I actually thought they where a pretty good motor for the price.

The old Enertion R-Spec 245KV where 50mm D x 60mm L

The new 2015 R-SPEC are all 63mm D x 55mm L

Early on In my product development I was always trying to keep the weight as low as possible, power to weight ratio mantra...

But now, When it comes to motors at least, My theory is simple: bigger is better.

But I'm a serious torque junky.

They've just been sent out recently so I should be receiving them soon. I can't wait for the longer extended motor shaft as well as the sensored aspects. Using 15mm belts are pretty awesome. I try to switch to 9mm again but it's hard because there's much more responsiveness with 15mm versus 9mm and no belt slip on 15mm.

However, it's much more difficult to run a dual rear setup. I do wish I got 63mm over the 50mm. Especially, for single motor 63mm is a better option depending on the gearing ratio. I do believe in onloop's idea of over spec on every item but with that can also sometimes come added weight. For dual rear 50mm's are more then fine. Single 50mm lacks going up 30 degree inclines. Flat's is fine though.

I think if you are going to be attacking lots of hills the climbing advantage AND braking advantage of duals is essential. I had rode single for a long time while I worked the bugs out of a dual setup and it worked great but as torqueboards suggests, I was fighting heat with that single motor and there were a few hills I could not attack. 

Now with dual I can go up and down almost anything with the exception of 4 local 29-31% graded streets.

dual motors are a must have for hills, or heavy riders.

My local area is mostly flat and I am a small guy so I enjoy the extra range of my single motor deck, but I took it through some hills the other day and it struggled. the dual motor board just eats them up.
(unfortunately it also eats up batteries as well)

I guess I'm lucky I live in a relatively flat area. but it goes to show that there is no real "one size fits all" solution with electric skateboards. I will happily forgo the extra motor for a longer range because I don't need the power. where as some of my other friends really need that extra power.
having said that, when the batteries do eventually run out the single motor is a lot nicer to kick push because it has less drag than the duals.

also novice skaters tend to need dual drive a lot more because of their cautiousness. the low down torque helps them move about slowly.
because I skate fast even without a motor I am able to use my momentum to cover small hills on a single where as some of my novice mates need the dual because the are a bit scared to go too fast and cant carry the same momentum.

so like I said. no "one size fits all"  for me personally single does the job. 
pros: lighter, cheaper, longer range, less drag.
cons: less torque, less drive surface.

I only recommend dual motors if the person plans on climbing 20-30% inclines and it's about 20-40% of their route.

I'm actually going to setup a single motor 6374 on 10S?12S and see if it's enough power to ride my daily route. I'd say about 30-40% of my route is uphill a 20% incline if not more on some parts.

It'll depend on gearing and your setup (kv, voltage, etc.).  I'm not too far off from you (265lbs/120kg) and ride even my single motor setups on the flats just fine.  The killer is hills.  Gear down, and the easer grade should be doable.  Might need to walk up a few though.  And a running start always helps!

Slow down there bullet.  ;)

22.2v is 6s, so 44.4 is 12s.  You will need DIYes or similar 12s opto ESC, or VESC, but the VESC will be limited to <200kv motors on 12s (you'll kill the DRV chip w/ 245kv motor on 12s).  In fact, @Chaka has a great writeup and suggestions on VESC motor combinations to avoid going over 60k ERPM which seems to be a better limit to avoid this.  So if you are set on 12s down the road - i'd look at the 149 or 170kv options.  190kv also may work, but be careful when fully charged.

I prefer VESC, but the simplicity of DIYes 12s opto ESC is enticing as well.  I just haven't tried one to comment/compare w/ VESC.  

For a big guy and wanting hills - yes you will need dual motors.  Gearing i would start running some calculators on gearing - but don't go below 13 or 14t on the motor gear (you'll get skipping on hard braking and later acceleration) - at least on 9mm belts.  For a bigger guy like yourself i might start w/ 12mm and possibly even 15mm wide belts - increased surface area and contact area will help.

Since we are both bigger guys, i'll share some planned setups to compare:

83mm wheels - 190kv - 6s - 14/36 (motor/wheel) = 15mph (ish)
8s = 18
10s = 23
12s = 30

I might gear down a bit more if possible w/ DIYes 40t wheel gear - same setups:

83mm - 190kv - 6s - 14/40 = 13mph
8s = 18
10s = 21
12s =25

Smaller wheels are better for hills and lower speed.  I really like big wheels though.  I like to ride over rougher roads and a similar setup w 97mm's:

97mm - 190kv - 9s - 13/40 = 20mph (on 12s = 27mph)

Hope this helps and good luck!

I've never ridden one motor except when one of my pair isn't working when the canbus comes disconnected again. I've never noticed any torque steering or any il effects but it's very underpowered on one.  How badly does using one strong motor affect handling?

Non-issue for me.  I've ridden more single setups than dual.  But i don't expect hills or drag racing acceleration.  I have another dual setup in the works for next boards.  

No spinning or issues i've noticed.  My buddies boosted dual+ is smooth, but i'm likely not pushing it hard enough to tell the difference besides just better acceleration.

I don't know for sure but I don't think it will have much of an affect.  It comes down to you're moving a mass distance X,  and if you use one motor,  that motor draws A amount of amps and you put in a total amount of work, W.  

You add a second motor to the mix and you're still going the full distance X,  your mass doesn't change (technically you're adding the weight of the motor and VESCs plus miscellaneous shit) so the total work W,  which is defined as Force x Distance. Force, is Mass x Acceleration,  assuming the change in mass is insignificant and your riding habits remain the same,  therefor use similar accelerations,  the force exerted by each motor should be half of that of just one,  meaning you're drawing less amps per motor,  or half.  

So the total force also remains the same.  So in the end,  two motors just translates into better traction and if we ignore the losses of friction and electrical losses of resistance of two set ups,  you end up around the same place,  but drawing less amps per motor,  keeping the system cooler and amp drawing to a reasonable amount per  VESCs.  So there are other benefits.

I completely agree with that,  but I don't think these minor losses will be significant when compared to that of air resistance for example. 

For a large body,  humans qualify as large bodies,  the air resistance is a function of K*V^2. Where k is a constant that is dependant on many things such as shape/aerodynamics  and the medium in which you're traveling through,  in this case air. And V is the velocity at any moment in time.  The resultant of that is a force btw,  so you double your speed,  you quadruple your air resistance which is a drag force on you.   You go from 6mph up to 24 mph and that's 16 times the air resistance. And once you pass a certain barrier it transforms from a squared function into a higher order function making the smallest increase in velocity that more difficult to achieve,  until you hit top speed essentially.   

The inefficiencies of a little more rolling resistance due to an extra motor and belt on there really won't make a huge difference here are it will more or less remain constant when compared to air resistance. And   especially when you consider the benefits added.  Like increases in acceleration,  braking,  safety of having some redundancy,  and better traction.

Here's an example for rolling resistance, your pulley resistance in this case,  for a car that weigh 1500 **kg**.  

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/0/4027d260d40800f283e3e9073d71941df9f551a9.png" width="281" height="500">

Do you see the magnitude of the coefficients?  One,  two,  three percent losses for a CAR with pneumatic tires,  urethane wheels have less losses than that even.

Not true actually. You don't see much loss because while there's twice the resistance of the belts, half as much power is needed to drive the board. It can actually save you power if you have a lot of load such as going up hills or if you're a heftier rider.

Ok.  if ur motor is smaller and put under too large a load, like a hill as u say, it'll have a lot of copper losses, and be more inefficient, but if a single motor is large enough on a board, rare, it wouldn't experience that.  So
Assuming no greater electrical losses from
too small a motor it's back to other losses 

The example above for a car is new to me but bikes I remember rolling resistance losses were finally superseded by wind resistance at 15mph. Thats a more typical speed for a board.  Considering how there's so much more rolling resistance on a belted or double belted board than a bike I'd think those losses would be more significant at an even higher speed.  Wind resistance can be huge but running a double belted board at only maybe 20mph...I wonder the losses.  There must be someone here who's done comparisons

There's potential to test this theory. Simply use the same set up, once with one motor and once with two. The test, reach 15mph for example and once you cross a line on the ground, which will be our start line, let go and coast to a stop. Measure the distance. Repeat with 2 motors, keeping all else the same. If there is a significant difference in rolling resistance then there should be a significant difference in distance as well (presumably twice the rolling resistance meaning half the distance if thats the only force acting on you and the board). Keeping it under 15mph will ensure that rolling resistance plays a larger role than air resistance and then maybe try it 3 times with each set up for a larger data group.

What would be interesting is doing this with a belt drive and then a hub motor and looking at the differences between those two set ups.

Yea some simple experiments would answer all the questions.  Anyone with a pair of strong motors could just compare them to running one of them solo and disconnect the other belt to see the differences in watt hours consumed to distance on a flat course.   
I'd like to compare hub motors.  Or one hub motor.  In theory one strong hub will get the best range ..assuming it's big enough. But that's talking just about potential efficiency and there's other benefits to running dual of course

The loss is around 20%. 
To me the benefits of dual motors is about torque and most important the brakes there is more braking power in dual. 

But since you are going to use disk brake you should go with the single motor that will have really good range.

@Kaly but those attributes you list for
Double aren't exclusive to double, a bigger single can get the torque and brakes.  Not maybe as good at handling though when doing accelerating or

Yes i have skidded in both instances, but have better braking ability with the dual drive. 
One thing is that I prefers pneumatics or soft flywheels, because of the braking performance among other benefits.

To me, my dual motor Raptor feels more than twice as powerful when both motors are running compared to only one motor running. The difference in acceleration is night and day! Top speed is basically the same, but the torque available feels more than twice as much with dual motors - I was very surprised at how much less powerful it felt when I broke a belt and was running off just one motor.

i'm on a tight budget :slight_smile:

I started with 6374 192kv on 12s and i'm really surprised how fast it is in both accelerating and topspeed 45-50km/u.

Of course dual delivers better performance but the comparison i read above is mainly not done with very powerfull 6374 single motors on 12s. I live in a flat area that helps but i also weight 97kg.

pros:
- cost
- efficiency
- simple design

dis:
- less torque
- torque steering
- braking force
- grip
- stress on drivetrain

So, does that mean the lack of torque produced by 2 hubmotors in comparison to two belt driven wheels would muliply the lack of torque by 2? Not arguing. I completely agree!

:joy:

I guess so but depends on the details. Maybe you'll come up and we can do some comparisons with a belt setup.  Watthours to mile for a start.
  Torque I get enough of with two of these little motors.  Definately more than boosted and it's pretty close to the gt

But as far as the original question..id rather have one strong motor

Imagine two of those hub motors attached to a belt drive. They would outperform themselves. Just kidding....

Strong single for street board if your town is not SF. Dual for off road.

I just experienced the difference between left and right wheel drive. Or it is just my imagination...
When i'm driving with my left side forward, and left wheel pulling, the ride is stable. Same with right wheel pulling, it is not so stable. And doesn't matter if the motor is on front or back truck.
I'm wondering, how it would be with dual motors? Any similar experiences?
I'm going to install a second motor anyway to get less strain for the belts.

dual rear? no. theres a difference but not enough. dual diaganol? absolutely! will be the next major change I make to my board! being able to pull from the front and back makes way more sense than just pushing twice as hard from the back. dual 149kv 6374 is lit! dual hubs could also be awesome
