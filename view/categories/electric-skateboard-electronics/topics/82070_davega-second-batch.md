DAVEga is a gadget that displays various data read from a VESC based controller, such as as speed, remaining battery capacity, and travelled distance. You can read more about it in [this thread](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/davega-battery-monitor-odometer-speedometer/71509). Four display layouts are currently supported -- two graphical in vertical mode, one graphical in horizontal mode, and one text only with detailed information. It's possible to toggle between the layouts with a button.

DAVEga is fully open source and anyone is welcome to build their own. Or you can now get two pieces from me -- one assembled and one unassembled -- for more-or-less the cost of the parts and shipping.

## What's in the package

One assembled DAVEga with the following accessories:
- USB-UART adapter (for updating/configuring the firmware)
- buttons
- crimped wires and JST-PH connectors
  - 4 pin (DAVEga side)
  - 7 pin and 8 pin (VESC side; use the one that fits your controller)

One unassembled DAVEga with the same accessories:

![DSC01824|690x413](upload://joN2WcdJPeAd9gn9QwjsEFicG3e.jpeg)

## What's NOT in the package

The display! There are various sources. I personally ordered several displays from [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/ILI9225-2-0-Inch-UART-TFT-LCD-Display-Module-SPI-Interface-Colorful-Screen-Serial-Port-176x220/32792711665.html) and all arrived and fully functional, so I can recommend this seller.

Note that there are many similarly looking displays that won't work with DAVEga. Make sure that the one you order is **2.0" TFT** using the **ILI9225 driver**.

Pro tip: You may want to order two. :smiley:

 ## Price

* **25 USD**
* or **22 EUR**
* or **550 CZK**

The price includes world-wide tracked shipping from the Czech Republic via the Czech Post.

## Ordering

To order, please PM me and specify the following:

* your full name
* your full address
* your preferred currency
* your preferred payment method (see below)

## Payment methods

PayPal is preferred. Friends & family is much appreciated but not required.

I can also accept payments on my [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) account. (May work best for those who don't have USD/EUR/CZK PayPal account since currency conversions on PayPal are expensive.)

## When do I pay?

When I receive your order, I'll send you back an estimate of when I will be ready to ship the Daves to you. Once ready, I'll PM you again with the payment information.

**Please don't send me any money unless explicitly asked for!** :smiley: 

## When will you ship?

I currently have parts for 50 DAVEgas and I have already assembled a few. I should be able to dispatch the first 25 orders relatively quickly (1-2 weeks). Then I need to order more stuff from AliExpress, which means about a month of wait. I will of course backorder prior to completely running out of parts if it looks like there's enough interest.

## Assembly tips
Use the assembled one as a template. 

When soldering the display headers (2x 5 pin header) to the PCB, you may want to plug-in the display first. That keeps the headers in the correct position with respect to each other. If you solder them one by one instead, it's slightly difficult to keep them in a straight line, which may then make plugging-in the display hard to impossible.

Make sure you have the MCU, the diode, and the electrolytic capacitor correctly oriented (there's a black arrow pointing to the negative side). For all other parts, the orientation doesn't matter.

If you don't have JST-PH crimps and/or crimping pliers, unpin the crimped wires from one of the 4 pin connectors and plug them into the 7 or 8 pin connector (depending on what VESC do you have). Then solder them to the wires on the other 4 pin connector (or add extension wires in-between if you need a longer harness).

(More detailed assembly instructions with pictures TBD.)

## Configuring firmware

See the [README](https://github.com/janpom/davega/blob/master/README.md) file in the [DAVEga firmware repository](https://github.com/janpom/davega/).

## Enclosures

Several printable enclosures are available on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=davega) thanks to @mmaner, @lrdesigns, and @JonathanLau1983. 

## How do I ask questions?

If you have any questions about **ordering, shipping, or payments**, please ask in **this thread**.

If you have questions about **DAVEga (assembly, connecting to VESC, troubleshooting)**, please ask in the **[DAVEga thread](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/davega-battery-monitor-odometer-speedometer/71509)**.

**Please do NOT PM me with questions.** I may not be able to respond back to everyone individually.

## FAQ

* Can I order just one?
  * No, sorry.
* Can I order more than two?
  * Not at the moment, sorry.
* I received your package but there was no display. WTF?
  * You may need to read the "What's in the package" and "What's NOT in the package" sections again.
* Are you making a lot of money on this?
  * No. :smiley:

I'll definitely do it, but I don't have it finished yet. Too much work, not enough time. I received so many orders yesterday that I had to staff up. :smiley:

Unfortunately the LCD I ordered more than a month ago has still not arrived so won't be able to test it...

Finally got the screens! Assembly was really easy and basically just plug nâ€™ play afterwards.

Just need a case and it will be ready!

@janpom Your work is just amazing!

Soldering job looked really good on the assembled board. @janpom can you share a bit of your soldering technique? Did you use extra flux or just rosin core solder?
```

## \#22 Posted by: janpom Posted at: 2019-05-14T13:27:54.103Z Reads: 115

```
Thanks! No extra flux. (Would be extra work to clean afterwards. :smile:) Just a thin 0.5 mm leaded (60/40) solder with flux core. That with my TS100 soldering iron and the default conical tip and default settings (300 Celsius). I have done quite a few of them now, which was a really good soldering practice.

It's all pretty straightforward. You'll obviously want to start with the smallest components. I typically went in the following order:
- resistor
- diode
- USB-UART female header
- crystal
- 22p and 100n capacitors
- MCU
- 100u capacitor
- JST-PH
- display headers

The display headers are best soldered on with the display plugged in. It's easier.

The USB-UART header is best done by soldering only one pin first; then reheat it with right hand and adjust position with the left hand. Solder the remaining pins last. The same goes for the JST-PH though that one I usually managed to do without having to re-adjust the position after soldering the first pin.

I didn't use any helping hands. I just kept the PCB on a flat surface.

Edit: I recorded the assembly.

rosin core sucks only use leaded 60/40 or 62/36/2 silver bearing solder.
```

## \#25 Posted by: gmurad Posted at: 2019-05-15T12:17:58.960Z Reads: 100

```
@briman05 Interesting, the general advice on the internet is to use rosin core for electronics. So when you use 60/40 that doesn't have flux in the core right? You add the flux yourself?
```

---
## \#26 Posted by: briman05 Posted at: 2019-05-15T14:10:46.443Z Reads: 99

```
No it has a flux core.  The internet is probably telling you to use lead free rosin core because is it safer health wise but leaded solder is superior
```

---
## \#27 Posted by: gmurad Posted at: 2019-05-15T14:23:46.089Z Reads: 93

Makes sense. Leaded 60/40 with flux core. I figure for people that are not soldering every day a little bit of lead is ok, but I could be wrong...
```

I have used leaded rosin core and silver bearing rosin core with no issues but non leaded is not as good for electronic work as leaded

63/37 is easier to work with. Kester is a good brand.

## \#30 Posted by: janpom Posted at: 2019-05-15T14:57:16.138Z Reads: 94

```
The fumes from the flux are actually more of a health problem than the lead. Keeping the temperature low reduces the fumes. For PCB soldering I usually do 300 Celsius but I tried going to 270 and that worked just fine as well. If possible, keep the window open while soldering and/or breath out when making a solder joint.

I have 5 last assembled DAVEgas that I'd like to let go. I won't be making any more kits. I also have 3 extra displays. Price:

- $16 - assembled DAVEga + USB-UART adapter + 4 simple buttons + parts for making a harness
- $7 - display
- $6 - shipping to EU, $7 to outside EU

Yes, I am. @LRDesigns designed a nice enclosure for it. We'll have it CNC-ed in aluminum and it will be super sexy. The bigger display won't be the only improvement. I'm completely rewriting the code for the ESP32 platform and adding a lot of new features. There's still a lot of work to be done though. I suppose it will won't be before 3-4 months until you can buy one. The price will be quite a bit higher than the current DAVEga but I hope we'll be able to keep it below $100 including the enclosure. No more spoilers for now. :slight_smile:
