Hello guys, I need help! Today after riding a couple of hours, one of the vescs fried all of a sudden.. Only one motor would spin, the other side was dead and red led was blinking. So I walked back home (!) and checked vesc tool. The faulty vesc never responded again while the other one was ok. After several attempts to have vesc tool reading the faulty vesc, also the second vesc died.. So now when trying motor detection in vesc tool I get problem 11 message on both of them and won't fix it. I'm on 12s lipo if that matters, vesc doesn't show marks of burn or short out. It's 1 month old. When I turn it on, it blinks blue first, green later and stays green until I pull the trigger of the remote. Then it blinks red and stays like that. I've just sent a message to flipsky but any help would be appreciated. Thanks

Edited to add links to the videos on Youtube to show the issue. You never know if someone is able to fix it!

File a charge back with your credit card company

I second this. If you paid with paypal, file there first. Their customer support is scummy and isn't worth going through, they'll likely say it's your fault or not help at all. 

I ended up having to file a chargeback myself after they refused to help my situation.

I see but there are parts in that order that actually do work well (motors, trucks, etc). Plus, They've already shipped a replacement for a faulty anti spark switch.. That should be in the mail soon but that was my only and first chance to talk with their client service and was not too bad. On the other hand I'm very disappointed with the vesc failing at me after only one month of moderate use.. I paid with credit card if that matters

Good luck my dude! They will only try to get your FSESC fixed and you will need to pay shipping yourself. How they treat customers is ridiculous. I have 2x dead FS 6.6's and 2x dead 6374 motors because the ESC fried it while it had a spazm.

I can't tell you haha. MakerX should be a good option. I'm still fighting for my 6.6 to be fixed lol.

Try to find a Unity or used focboxes. There should be a bunch of options later in the year.

Not to shit on @kevingraehl because his deal hes offering is the best one as of right now.  However Jeff Wu from Neo is selling V4 and V6 focboxes on the other forum for 80 and 120 respectively but they won't be out until late february.

Thanks for pointing out.. i'm quite in a rush because i've nothing to ride at this stage but thanks, that's a good call and i'm very much new to the focboxes so i'm not even aware of what the differences are nor i know what @kevingraehl is selling. i've sent him message in PVT but have not heard from him yet.  @itsrow: I'd appreciate any additional info you can provide!

https://forum./t/neobox-open-source-focbox-variant-hw-6-design/12426 @kevingraehl, give this a read fellas, and since its a unity @Secco, I wouldn't buy it, relies on volunteer time to update the software because its not default VESC software and plagued with so many problems that will never be fixed because of enertion disbanding.

Edit: charging $400 for a unity (with 0 aftermarket support if something goes wrong) to someone looking for a quick replacement for a FSESC4.20 is a sizeable dick move.

Ahhhhh Jason fucked up my link, you little cheeky bastard you.

@kevingraehl is sellings focbox for $200 each. What a joke!!!! Stay away from that opportunist and gets yourself on the other websites. Neobox is on its way for $80-$100 each. Theys plan to be a perfect  replacement for focboxes since Enertions is goin under. Makersx from ebmakers is a good budgets esc that is currently available but they donts go too powerful ( hall sensor and uart pins are different though).

Agreed, literal predator looking to scam the uninformed.  Hopefully he stays on this shitty forum, don't need garbage on the new one.

Hey Marco,
I went with Focbox Unity after Flipsky and am satisfied with Focbox Unity. 

2 thing to remember when hookinh up Focbox Unity:
Keep the wires that deliver the power from your battery pack to your Focbox Unity to the absolute minimum length. Also, use wire  of similar Diameter to those that are pre-installed on The Focbox Unity. Maybe 1 gauge size larger if you want, but no more. 

Second thing to remember, the Focbox Unity works approximately the same if you leave the Sensor Ribbon Cables which come from same place as the 3 phase motor wires disconnected.

 Thus, for higher Reliability, you might try leaving the Ribbon Cables not connected, at least initially. Leaving them disconnected means a little less precision when going slowly at 0-3 miles per hour, after that its about the same performance as with the ribbon cables connected. You should run the Guided Setuop without the ribbon cables connected and also disable the motor temp sensors in the Focbox UI software. Then just remember to check them occasionally if riding a far distance continuosly. 

( I have hub motors, so if I have been riding a long time, I just spit a little bit on the tip of my finger and then touch the end of the motor wheel axle. If the spit turns to steam instantly, then you might want to let them cool down a bit. )

Last thing for repairing any VESC, there is a low cost tool that allows you to fix perhaps 50% of the problems you will encounter. There is a great article about how to do it online. Just copy and paste this in to Google Search:  Unity not booting? You are not alone! (How to fix the bootloader (https://forum./t/unity-not-booting-you-are-not-alone-how-to-fix-the-bootloader/9582)

Thanks guys. this is all pretty much useful. I'm a newb in e-sk8 and this was my first build. I'm currently facing the first issues with vescs failing at me etc so any advice is very much welcome. BTW i've ordered a Go-FOC Retro from Maker X yesterday and upon inquiring about shipment they just reverted saying that it's going to be delayed to february because of Chinese new year. I just wanted a decent replacement for my broken flipsky but it looks like this is way more diffcult then expected. I think i'll cancel that order and wait for neobox but... yeah last few days were quite frustrating.

Many thanks for chiming in with this info. For my build i have like 50-60 cm wires to connect the battery to the esc. I cant make it shorter... would that be too much? and may i ask why?

Not sure i understand this comment. can you please elaborate a bit more? i've sensorless motors so not sure if this applies to my build? 

I'm currently deciding whether to buy a Unity from a guy in UK for 225 Â£ or a Go-FOC Retro from Maker X for 155 $. What would you guys suggest? Consider i'm coming from a dual esc from flipsky based on 4.2,

I'm going to be honest here, fuck the unity, non-standard implementation of VESC hardware and software with 0 recourse the second something goes wrong at damn near the price of a VESC 6+ which is bulletproof.  The GO-FOC from Maker X at least is using standard VESC4.12 hardware and software and I've heard they have pretty good support for trouble shooting and fixing them yourself is doable because the gerber is posted.  Its based on v4.xx hardware while new generations are based on v6.xx but the only sizeable difference is the addition of a sampling shunt which smooths high speed acceleration but personally I would go with the GO-FOC Retro simply because I burnt damn near 6 VESCs before I ever got my board working.

Hey Secco,
 
My apologies for taking so long to reply. 

Since you are using "Sensor-less" Motors, you will not have to worry about connecting the Hall Sensors to the ESC. So that doesn't apply to you. 

Also, if your wires between your battery pack and your ESC are 50-60 cm long, then that is probably your issue! It also matters what your ESC voltage and Current and Power Rating are. THe further below these you are, the longer the wires you can tolerate. but it can be difficult to predict.

I'll try to keep this brief and my understanding is not perfect, but gives an idea. 

First, there is some part of each ESC Electric Speed Controller that is subjected to the maximum "DC" Voltage of the Battery all the time.

Now as soon as that DC Voltage and the subsequent current enter the ESC, the constand Power from the battery is chopped in to a lot of little spikes, maybe 1 thousand spikes per second for example,. 

Your ESC decides how many of those little spikes to let through to your motor depending on how far your squeezing your handheld remote controll trigger. 

Also, wherever there is a electric current flowing, there is a field or cloud of electrons surroundign it. 

For example, around your battery cables might be a region about 1cm in diameter and cylinder shaped all around the wire with a high electron density. 

When current starts to flow, the electron cloud around your batter cable appears, and when current stop flowing, the electron cloud disappears. 

So basically the bigger and longer your battery to esc wires, the more electrons will be floating around them in this cloud. 

So when you arecruising at 1 or 2 miles per hour, your ESC is only allowing 1 or 2 spikes of power to go to the motors every say 100 spikes. but if you then squeeze the throttle hard, the controller will start llowing a lot more electricity through and it will suck the electricity and some ofthe electron cloud with it toward the motor. but then you suddently let go of the throttle, and all the current that had begun to rush in to the controllers DC to AC sonvertor is stopped and only a little is allowed through.

THis creates something like a Electrical "Waterhammer" which is a plumbing phenomenon and applies to water in solid pipes primarily. Buy o'm just saying tht having those long wires or thick wires and expeciallky if your batter ysupplies close to the maximum voltage the exc can run on, well when you go from almost t=no throttle or full throttle to the opposite, it causes an inductive spike which may cause a spike to come out of the DC to AC chopper system in your ESC. If one of those spikeshits a sensitive comopnent, it may permanently damge it. 

Not this is an oversimplification and it is late and I need to go to sleep. But I have seen in my own board that having excessive cables from battery to controller kills controllers. so even if it is not the best layout or the most aesthetic way to do it, you should rearrangethe stuff on your board so that the ESC is like within 4 to 6 inches of your battery;
