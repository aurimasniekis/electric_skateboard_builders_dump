Hi I'm new to this esk8 stuff and am currently builds my own electric longboard I'm I've got some lipos but I've recently found out I can get my hand on some small battery pack and was wondering if it's possible to connect them into a larger pack for my board? <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/0/a05f042e13a347d8a2533877a2400022dccd39d9.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/9/19959f67323f9090d50b23646b7849e9176c9efb.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/3/334b4abbf246959722bb11e339a20822fc554e38.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/8/386285a365e7c24876b08c1fa772777cab983ec2.JPG" width="375" height="500">

From looking at the images those are made with simple AA Batteries - they will not be able to deliver the needed currents. Lipo or Liion is what you want.

you would need so many that you'd probably build the first esk8 trailer to take them all with you ;)

it says on the side they are alkaline. you would need hundreds of them to make anything worth while..
stick with lipo's or li ion's
