While waiting for the rest of my parts to arrive from around the world I got to work learning how to design simple PCB boards with EasyEDA and designed this battery holder.

![18650 PCB bottom|690x332](upload://xqFvEeaFK6UzPtMNmLztcpje0Zm.jpg)

Size is 65mm x 68mm and fits 4P.

Only thing I am not sure on and haven't managed to find anything about is the best way to finish the positive and negative pads at the top and bottom to handle the most amount of amps.

In the current design I've created a copper pour and removed the solder mask, but I would like to know if that is the best way to do it?

If anyone is interested in playing around with this and changing it to fit there own build the file can be found [here](https://easyeda.com/editor#id=e5493b5cfe4548dda1ec3518043f8446).  
It would be nice if we can get a collection of different designed and share them all with the community so everyone could find something that fits there build or easily modify a design to make it work.

For manufacturing I'm using [jlcpcb](https://jlcpcb.com).

I know people have done this but I want a design that fits exactly what I want for my build. 
The ones designed by Kug3lis are not what I want otherwise I would have purchased them.

Yea and the first reply to that is asking for 3p or 5p.
This is a simple design that is open to anyone to download and improve or change to whatever they want for there own build.

@blasto was the first one to draw those kind of pcb üòâ

And this design as kindly been giving to the community

It actually is a 3P and 4P, I designed it so that it can be cut to smaller width (no balance traces in the place that gets cut off) so that you can use 3P. I have also tried 5P and while it is doable you lose some of the strength but it still is strong.

Yes Blasto should get the credit for getting the ball rolling. Followed by improvements of others.

I can‚Äôt work with the link I sent you as i‚Äòm only on mobile device, but for me it looked like the design you can change by your own to 3p too.
In the first post is also a link to where you can get them made

Make your own.  It's really not difficult.  I have already provided a direct link to the design that you can modify to fit your own build in the OP.

Hi, 
here is a more permanent link to my drive this time:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W7aUZjm7InzBRR0FbJrqivtnSiai4-o0

It does fit 3P, you will need to cut off a piece of the PCB so that the PCB is not wider than the 3 cells. Of course if you dont mind the PCB being wider, it can be used as is.

Does anywhere sell cells connected to the pcb and that‚Äôs it? 

 People typically will solder multistrand between these right?

how does the nickel connect to the copper trace on the board?
