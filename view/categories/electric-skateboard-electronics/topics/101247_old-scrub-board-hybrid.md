Hey Guys 
I have seen a three wheeled skateboard and wanted to try my own.
So far I have tried two steering options both of which are not doing the job two would for a turning circle I'm happy with.
I dont want to make a skooter do you have any constructive ideas?![DSC_3358|281x500](upload://pKtF8TwJqZEYYQU9AVVF71smhlE.jpeg) ![DSC_3359|281x500](upload://ycPOx6E2ZgllfjGJUEeV6r4HkOI.jpeg)

It won't be pretty but it'll get your foot in the door!
