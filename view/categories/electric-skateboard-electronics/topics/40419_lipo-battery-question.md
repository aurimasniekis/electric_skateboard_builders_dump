When riding my eskateboard, am i not suppose to drain the battery to 0%? I heard it is not good to drop the volts of the lipo battery to under 3v/cell. If that true, then does that mean i have to monitor my eboard's volt so it doesnt ever drop below that voltage during my ride?

Yes. IMO you should not take lipo cells under 3.6v, which is about 15-20%. If you go further down you will have a much higher chance of that the cells starts to swell.

You can go down to 3.4v per cell but 3.6v is better.
I usually keep mine above 3.6v
A percentage meter is not really a good gauge for Lipo packs.
Better to monitor the battery voltage.
And remember that all cells will likely discharge unevenly which is why you should balance them with every charge.
And also a good reason to be conservative with your minimum voltage.

Ive got about 10 charges on my lipos and havent seen any significant drift on them, less than 0.03 after 80% discharge, do you mean over multiple charges without balancing? I might try that for science.

I balance every charge
Always have, always will.

How many cycles do you typically see before replacement?

I’ve only had my current setup for a year so I haven’t had to replace them. 
I did replace one pack early on because one of main wires broke loose inside the pack.
I really don’t keep track of how many charge cycles.

I see, Im pretty new to lipos and trying to get an idea of what I can expect out of them.

I've got a pack similar to @Namasaki, mine are a lower C.  I've for around 100 charges over 14ish months with no issues so far.  I also balance charge, but I'm using a BMS to do it for me.

I've been doing this for lazyness.
I balance once a week at first, now its like once a month.
and this is with series discharge, parallel charge.
theres really only drift if you go lower than 3.6v.
This is with tiny 10s 3ah 20c packs.

10ah lipo had more drift, but with an 8s balance charger its all fine! ;)

lipo packs are already matched pretty well and I have an old low power 18650 pack with no bms, stays in sync.

hand made 18650 packs are different, because from what I know, no one is using any kind of internal resistance matching yet. even if you did, how accurate is the test setup?
