My eboard is going to be built with vesc, 5000mah 3s 20c batteries. Turnigy 6374 motor. I would like to install a SBEC. Can I use any of these? What exactly does a SBEC do?

Why do you need an UBEC ?
The VESC can deliver 5V to your receiver :)

Use the search button ;) Everything you need to know is allready somewhere here in the forum.

If you buy high Quality cells to build your pack, you wont need a bms. Because (As long you dont do something wrong) they stay balanced for about a year or two. Just check them with a multimeter every month to stay safe.
If you get cheap cells or laptop cells, wou will need a bms.

I assume you are going to run these in series for 6S?  Just get a decent balance charger and you will be good.  The [Turnigy Accucel-6](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-accucel-6-50w-6a-balancer-charger-w-accessories.html) & the [IMAX B6 50W](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/imax-b6-50w-5a-charger-discharger-1-6-cells-genuine.html) are both good chargers.  Don't forget to get a power supply with them as well.

I never used Lipos... Not sure if they work better with bms.
When i start to use them (With my next build), i will use a voltage display/Voltage buzzer. So if any cell go down to much, it will warn me.

I feel safer with a buzzer. You know if something in your pack goes wrong. A Bms never says to you if your cells are just okay or allready dead. Thats why i dont trust them.

THere are a lot people using Lion packs with a BMS, so I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it, but I prefer to balance charge so I can see the cell values.  I'm always thinking about maybe getting 1 bad cell and having to toss a pack because of it.  I am actually waiting on a 10s Lion pack with BMS, but if youa re going to run 6s, Id just get a balance charger and the [MEB Simple Charging Port](https://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/ez) and be done with it.
