My Hobby King 149kv 6374 has a small shaft and barely fits a 9mm pulley. Any idea as where to buy longer motor shafts and how to install them? Thanks!

Hobby King sells replacement shafts. Not sure if they'll sell extended shafts. Try and find a shaft coupler and trim the excess

I don't see why you couldn't get a custom length shaft made.  the shafts are easy enough to replace.
