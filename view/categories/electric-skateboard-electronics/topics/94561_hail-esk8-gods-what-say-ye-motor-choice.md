OR

Torqueboards are now battle-hardening from the factory and sound like a good choice

The Maytech is priced at 150US$ and the Torqueboards 120US$...

Why the premium?

"Torqueboards are now battle-hardening from the factory " and Maytech also has some motors that have epoxy in between the magnets, also called battle hardening.

Also, great cs, qc, and depending on the model can have better parts like high temp magnets and reinforced cans. Pretty important stuff for skateboard motors. Not that the cheaper ones won't get you where you need to go.

Maytech and BKB  FTW although sk3 are also great but no silicone wires, no sensors, no keyway, cheaper.

If you have to keep replacing the flipsky are they really cheaper than maytechs?

I took risk and got the flipsky 6374(nov2018) and have recently completed 800km on it. But might be better to buy battle hardened motors.

SK3 because they have a proven track record and are waterproof out of the box.  
Also if you can't ride without sensors then you have no business on an esk8  :sunglasses:

Girly throttle control.  My remote is either on or off.  I really only need a big red on button.
