Hello All,
I made another post on these batteries specifically about the amperage and the risks, but that has been resolved and taken care of. 
I am making this new thread to discuss if it is a good idea to purchase and use these batteries for a few reasons...
1) They are technical "used" but they are tested
2) I have watched [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nmDj0Ykn-c&t=) video on my batteries and it said that they have high internal resistance which I think means they are dying?
3) I wanted to use [THIS](https://www.ebay.com/itm/BMS-for-36V-10-cells-Li-Ion-Battery-Pack-16A-Drain-Rate-With-Balance-Function/153030426502?hash=item23a152ff86) cheapo BMS to bypass it explicitly for charging, but I am worried about the cells becoming unbalanced...
4) And finally) is 8s1p 8000mah pack with them for a dual 200kv setup a good idea?
[Batteries](https://www.ebay.com/itm/4-SPIM08HP-3-7V-8AH-LITHIUM-POLYMER-BATTERIES-25C-200A-SUPER-CELLS-24V-36V-48V/183036786061?hash=item2a9dd7b58d:g:mskAAOSwhfdaakSO)

Thanks a million!

Edit: I forgot the link to the BMS :joy:

If they have high internal resistance I would strongly recommend not to get them as they will probably no longer produce the max out put and will run hot. They also may not have many cycles left.

Cheap packs can be bought from HobbyKing with confidence, just donâ€™t get multistar batteries

My problem is that I am SERIOUSLY penny pinching, as with buying 8 of those batteries, I am up to 750 USD and I don't have really any more money to spend... (I haven't bought them BTW)

It is cheaper in the long run to buy high quality parts than it is to replace a board that burned down. Lipoly batteries are great, so long as they are meticulously maintained and cared for. They are dangerous otherwise, and as you don't know how they have been treated, don't waste your money on them. The battery of an esk8 is NOT the part to skimp on. Doing so will not work out well for you

This is defiantly true... So If I were to make a 8-10s pack with about 10-15 mph of range, what sort of Amp Hours would I need and what cells should I use to be budget friendly?

You will spend a significant amount more than you think you will spend, no matter what the amount you think you will spend is.

On a pre-built, the cost is set upfront.  This is what you want.

I think I have come up with a solution. I am going to purchase some Samsung 25r Cells from BatteryJunction at 3.65 USD for a 10s3p Li-Ion with a total of 7.5 Amp Hours. This will only add about 50 USD to my Budget, bringing it to a solid $800.

Not to shabby for a sensored dual Motor setup? I mean I'm in my mid-teens and I'm a twig so I'm gonna fly :joy:
Also I already have 1 VESC I just need a second so that cuts $100

I have had both good and absolutely terrible experiences with HobbyKing.  I have 12s 8000mAh batteries in my single motor board that work fine.  I also have the same batteries in my dual motor board and I seemed to be blowing a cell every 2 weeks even though they were 25C cells supposedly capable of 200A.

I've heard it can be hit or miss, so far I've only had hits so can't really complain but I also hear they are pretty good about replacing anything that is DOA.

I received a DOA battery, got it RMAed and received a second DOA battery. So I said screw it and bought a spot welder and a bunch of 18650s and got to work.

7.5Ah will be plenty I have a 10S at 5Ah or 185Wh and can get 12 miles out of it (also a small person and I don't floor it the whole time but average something like 15mph occasionally a bit faster if the road is nice) so I think you'll be fine.

@kuphjr yeah given all the issues I've seen people have with their homemade first time spot welding 18650 packs I'm glad I've avoided it so far.  I've just been using lipos for a couple of years, I'll probably buy a prebuilt 18650 pack in a while here but just dumped a bunch of cash into quadcopter FPV gear for my other favorite hobby :)

I didn't have issues building my own li-ion pack my first time.  I just followed the best practices on this forum.  If you ride your board a lot I think it is worth the cost of replacing lipos. After I build another li-ion pack for my single motor board, I am pretty confident in producing packs for other people if you are ever interested.

Dang, I just checked my soldering iron and it's only rated to 40w, so I'm not so certain I should use that to do my pack. Does anyone know any cheap solderless kits or tools to make a 18650 pack?

Seems like NESE pack is pretty decent from the few people I've seen use them definitely don't want to be soldering the cells unless you can keep the heat transfer into the cells to a minimum would definitely go with one of the solder less kits or spot welding and if you plan to diy post a thread for the build to get tips/pointers before calling it good.

 I actually just went digging in my basement and found a 90-120w soldering gun that was my grandfather's. I cleaned it up a bit and I have used it fairly recently so I know it is in working order so i guess i can use that. I totally forgot I had it.

For a dual motor build, you will be using too many amps for a NESE kit. You will need to spot weld. If you would like, I would be able to build you a pack too since I have a spot welder and have built 5 battery packs since I got it.

I would just charge $30/hr plus cost of parts. It would probably take me <4 hours for a 10s3p pack. That is still cheaper than the cost of buying a spot welder, nickel strip and everything else.

I realy appreciate the offer @kuphjr but I think I'm just going to solder them. I have a high wattage iron and from what I have read I should not damage the cells if I am quick. I might also be able to borrow a spot welder from a friend, so I hope to be able to do that.

Would like to make a point here. NESE modules has superior power transfer comoared to spotwelding. There is nothing to compare. You can use quad motors and it would still be plenty of overhead.
Nickel is not as conductive compared to copper used in NESE. You spotweld 0.2mm nickel strips compared to 0.6mm copper tabs in NESE. Reliable are of contact with spotwelding is the are of a spotweld and it will newer be higher than on NESE covering most of the posive cell end contact. ;)

Are you serious or just trolling???

Spot welding does not dictate one to use a certain material. Eg. My welds with copper pads. 
![image|666x500](upload://tNwf0oHODNzhpyDQC0jM2GmxmfC.jpeg)
But you do have a point in that copper is four times as conductive as nickel. 

[quote="agniusm, post:24, topic:61302"]

[/quote]
Negative. The reliable contact area for spotwelding when done well is the area between all the welds. The weld points do have a lower resistance as the metals are fused together and there is no air gap. Not only that but the welds provide a mechanical junction.  NESE relies on springs or some kind of device to keep pressure on the tabs which is fine but there is still an air gap at the microscopic level between the pads and the cell as no surface is truly flat. The contact area is only as reliable as the holding mechanism. 

If you say that the only reliable contact area in a spot welded cell is the spot weld itself then there is no reliable area in the NESE as there is no mechanical junction between the two metals. 

The only thing you have a point with is that copper is more conductive than nickel. But that certainly does not make your product better than spot welding. Nice try tho

You said it yourself, when done right. How many out of 100 can do proper spotwelding? How many of those who can have equipment costing thousands? You find the numbers to be very low.
You posted a spotwelded copper and that is fine, but have you thought of it turning green and oxidising? Bet not. There is your resistance going up. And you can see oxide forming on heated places of the welds.
 I don't have to pretend of so called micro invisible air gap in my design as i have numbers, and the number is 0.622mOhm per cell of resistance. And in regards to compression, it is based on materials that went through extensive testing at different temps and service life.
So, your statement: ''For a dual motor build, you will be using too many amps for a NESE kit. You will need to spot weld. If you would like, I would be able to build you a pack too since I have a spot welder and have built 5 battery packs since I got it." is as false as it can be.
My packs are designed for motorcycles and eboards, how many motors you would mount is a toy compared.

P.S. Speaking of proper spotwelding, you forgot insulators on positive ;) Not so professional after all :smile:

I've seen a few arduino spot welders on ES that can weld copper. I think they cost a couple hundred bucks max. It's not for the faint of heart but we are in a DIY forum after all....

***Were we talking about which is easier or better?*** Because your product is definitely easier to use, but definitely not better.

I take paypal if you want to send the money there. Assuming people are dumb really makes you look like an ass.... Lets go through it slowly:

***What is copper oxidation?***
Copper oxidizes due to exposure to oxygen (duh) and moisture in the air. Copper only oxidizes at its surface, that's why you can polish and clean it off... 

***What is welding***
A weld is essentially two metals fused together, therefore there are no gasses (or air) in the weld. This means that there is nothing for the copper in the weld to oxidize to.

***Why do welds not oxidize?***
Well. if you can put two and two together then I'm guessing you can see where I'm going here.
A proper spot weld does not contain any air in it and therefore cannot and will not oxidize over time.

***Where will oxidation form?***
The copper will oxidize over time unless fully sealed off from ambient air with desiccant to absorb any moisture at the surface. This does not affect the electrical properties of the copper pad as oxides form on top of the copper and not in it. The effective cross sectional area of the conductor does not change even when oxidized.

***Will a water pipe still conduct water if it's rusted on the outside?***
(Hint: YES)

 

[quote="agniusm, post:26, topic:61302"]
There is your resistance going up.
[/quote]
***Nope. read above....***

[quote="agniusm, post:26, topic:61302"]
And you can see oxide forming on heated places of the welds.
[/quote]
***Heck, you must have the same software they use on Criminal Investigation TV Shows where they can zoom/enhance anything into view!!!!*** But seriously, no, there is no oxidation in my welds. I use a arc welder which works very much like a tig welder (if you've ever used one). They use argon gas as a shield to flood out any air around the weld before the electrode comes down and makes the weld. 

Here is a better look at how welds look after cleaning under proper lighting.

[quote="agniusm, post:26, topic:61302"]
and the number is 0.622mOhm per cell of resistance
[/quote]
***This is actually almost useful!*** What is the cell? What was the SOC? What are the dimensions of the copper used? What was the measuring method? You do realize we are talking about less than a few milliohms  of resistance? Your average multimeter would not be able to measure this. I could recreate your experiment here and compare numbers but I honestly don't have the time. Oh well.... ***(All of the above questions are rhetorical, I don't actually care if you answer them)***

[/quote]
***Please point me to the post where I wrote those words, cause I do not remember writing any of that.*** 
Just so that we're clear, I have done over 40,000 individual welds (well, my cnc machine has), welded over 5,000 cells, and finished over 50 packs with anywhere for 50-200+ cells. Again, I have not even seen your design to decide whether or not it could handle a dual motor eskate, but without a doubt, spot welding is a better method and ***any of my packs would blow yours out of the water.***

He shows 5 welds that are about 1mm each in diameter so spotwelded cell will have 3.9mm^2 of reliable contact are. My tabs are precision stamped and have 50mm^2.
I doubt that he can weld more than 0.2 copper so comparing to my 0.6mm tabs its less of conductor.
