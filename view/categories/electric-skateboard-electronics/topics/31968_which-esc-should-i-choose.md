HI after my Alien esc burned out I can't decide between the Hobbyking 120a boat esc and the Flycolor 150a esc. They are both similarly priced but I dont know which one is better with the brakes, reliabiity,conveniance, how much they heat up....
Also I haven t been able too find too much reviews of the flycolor esc so if anyone has used it or the other one please share your opinion.

Neither, get a VESC, thank me later. I know it aint cheap but you've already burnt thought one cheap ESC. Don't set yourself up for it to happen again.

I can speak for the HK 120A Boat ESC personally..... it's shit!

Brakes are terrible and acceleration control is awful. Great on heat though, never heats up. lol

Hi could you elaborate on the braking and accelerationfor this esc....because I'm quite light so the brake might work for me as well as it did for other people.( Ex: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=52759). Thanks very much

I can only speak about the 120A boat ESC, It's so bad!
Really don't buy it, it has just no brakes because they are so unpredictable.
If you want to buy a good 6S ESC, go for the hobbyking 120A X-car beast or the FVT 120A ESC.

I got the FVT 120A for 3 months now and it's running very good, haven't had problems with it.
If you want to change some small things I should buy the programcard:

Haha yeah totaly true, it's so bad but if you're going uphill you never need to worry about an exploding/burning esc.
If it had just normal brakes and smooth startup it was a great esc actually ;)

Basically they work, sometimes! But then they're either off or on, no gradient to it at all. But then because of that, you're slowing down, so you pull the brake, it nearly knocks you off, so you let off, now the ESC thinks you're in neutral, so the next pull of the brakes is actually reverse!! So you then get thrown off or your wheel shreds! :confused:

It's not good for eSk8 at all!
