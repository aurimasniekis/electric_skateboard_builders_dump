Hello,

I am wondering if anyone has the eagle schematic for the Vedder Anti Spark Switch I downloaded the files from vedders GitHub but they open and the only reason I can find online is that they probably were made in the eagle program.  I am trying to make my own power board distribution board to avoid some wires.
