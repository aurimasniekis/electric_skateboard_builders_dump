We all want to prevent a fire from happening, but that is not always the case. There are plenty of threads on battery building safety etc. So I wanted to talk about what is the best and or most practical way to subdue a lithium battery fire. and prevent further loss of property or worse. 

Lion or lipo, they both burn pretty similar. They create their own oxidiser so they are almost impossible to put out, also the heat can travel from cell to cell creating a slow traveling chain reaction that will not stop burning until all the cells are burnt out. 

The other reason I am starting this topic is there seems to be some confusion about what to use to put out these fires. Most people saying you need a special type of fire extinguisher, but many experts saying using lots of water is the best way. This is to reduce the temperature and prevent the fire spreading. Its not really to put out the battery fire. 

The special fire extinguisher people talk about is a class D which is a for lithium metal fires, our batteries do not contain solid metal lithium so a class D should not be used. Lithium **battery** fires are a considered a flammable liquid fire (B class) and can be extinguished with normal ABC extinguishers. From my reading the most ideal is a class B foaming type. 

Also its not like anyone is going to be carrying a huge fire extinguisher in their back pack! So what are the practical alternatives? 

I use my board to commute and one of my biggest fears is that it spontaneously starts to combust while I'm on the train. I have considered carrying one of these [fire blankets](https://hken.rs-online.com/web/p/fire-blankets/0523156/) which I could throw over the board to somewhat contain a fire. 

I have also considered carrying a bag of sand or a bag of bi-carbonate soda. What you guys think about my ideas for back pack extinguishers?

I ordered this. Thankfully I haven't had to use it yet, but it also fits nice in a backpack for those first few beta rides. I think it says it puts out chemical fires. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002U0KGDY?psc=1&ref=yo_pop_mb_pd_title

Absolutely! Rather have that thing in your backpack then fight a fire with your fist's!
I've bought this. It's 2kg and fit's in a regular backpack. Works well with electrical and chemical fires

My biggest fear is that my battery will explode in the apartment during charging or such, I had nightmares about it... 
But what should you do? I have a fire blanket and a abc fire extinguisher to be prepared if it would happen.. 
I've heard water can make it even worse cuz it can cause a chemical reaction?

While on a saftey course about lithium batteries and other dangerous goods the lecturer basically told us its best to let the fire burn out (contained obv) since its very hard to stop a lithium fire and you'd probably end up hurting yourself rather then putting it out. But if possible, completely submerging it in water would do the trick. Not sure how i feel about tossing my board into the ocean tho.

Well lithium metal will explode in contact with water, I think it gets very hot and makes hydrogen. :boom: My science teacher demonstrated this to our class, was cool. Like 20 years ago though before safety was so serious. 

But lion batteries don't have lithium in metal form. Its in micro particles in the electrolyte that don't react strongly with water according to the experts.

For your house I would add fire alarms and a bucket of sand. What you have already is good too.

This is my welding spot. I always have around a fire extinguisher a fire blanket and several fireproof XL bags.
I never used any of those. I work very carefully but shit happens. I think they are a must on every table. Better have'em and not use'em than need'em and cry later

I'm thinking that if I had to I could throw the board in the bathtub and start filling it with cold water until it's completely submerged...that or throw it out the window if possible. 

I have no problems sacrificing my board to save my apartment and my neighbour's.

A question I also asked my self not only once.
Just found that:
https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07CKQZWGG

Don't know if it´s that good but the description sounds good.
I read that salt water is better than normal water.
But the problem is that often the cells start to burn from inside again.
So like others already said, best way to through it into the ocean ;)

There also a punch of different boxes to store the battery or place it while charging.

One of the annoying parts of my board is having to open the enclosure to charge.  It works for me, but it does allow for checking the IR and use a hobby charger.  12s6p from dead to full under three hours.  It also allows me to detach a pack of it decides to burn while charging.  
If I was concerned about charging regular lipo.  I would do it in a lipo bag sitting on a frying pan so I could carry it outside.  Lithium fires are hard to put out because until the reaction which caused the fire loses fuel it will keep burning.  

Fires are rare, but having a plan in case one happens is a good idea.

maybe just covering it up with 20kg of sand so it does not spread and wait til it all burns out or something?

You could actually throw a couple of motors and vescs on that thing and ride it. Just make sure the batteries are in reach of the hose

I dunno if I’d like anything as hard as a fire extinguisher in a backpack, broken ribs anyone?

There are some small options 1kg, 0.5kg.
A light, mountable, quick release bracket which comes with some of them,  plenty of mounting options, that don’t necessarily need to be close to the battery and in fact you could get it off very very quickly and at least have a fighting chance.

Wearing a helmet, gloves etc I don’t see how you would not be able to get the extinguisher off before critical mass occurs

Lol true, the faster it burns, the quicker it’ll be out.

Honestly though this has got me thinking about putting a little hole in the top of my deck the runs a tube into my enclosure near the battery, if anything happens I can get one of those spray can things and shove the nozzle into the tube. Not sure if it would really help that much though

the glass melts and covers the fire so no oxygen can reach it anymore.

you legit need a class D copper powder fire extinguisher... ABC (traditional red extinguishers) will not work because as someone stated earlier, the li-ion cells produce their own oxidizers as they burn. Class D copper powder extinguishers are USUALLY not available in smaller than 30lb containers tho, so good luck carrying that around everywhere... i have one in my workshop and it cost me 800 USD from a local supplier who also recharges them every 6 years for free if the seal is not broken

This is not true, you only need a class D for Lithium Metal since it has Lithium in solid state and alot more than in Li-ion. One of the best ways to put a li-ion fire out is by reducing the heat. One of the go to ways in the industry and research is to use water, you can pour that directly on a li-ion fire and around it to stop it from spreading. Pouring water on a li metal fire would only make it worse. Foam works best but CO2 and ABC still works on normal lithium fires.

Hey! I wanna help ease some worries...How long have you been charging at home? Keep in mind that we see a disproportional amount of bad cases because everybody else without problems isnt posting about it. If we posted every single day about how we DIDNT have a fire, this forum would be OUT OF CONTROL. Just dont cheap out with your components and make sure to protect them as much as you can. Having a nice BMS/high quality tested cells mean nothing if they're flopping/rattling around in your enclosure while you ride.

There is that one in a million chance that you got a factory bad cell that fails. But even then if you are worried about your batteries catching fire you probably shouldn't be building them.

Monitoring the health and state of your cells is like #1 in my mind for safety, which makes it crazy to me how many people use "dumb" BMS's that don't tell you anything.

Have shared this a few times 

https://youtu.be/gobFcNzGG9I

I shamefully only have a regular fire extinguisher at my place, I'll have to make a trip to the local homeless despot to get some sand but I think it's the best option.  My battery enclosure allows me to slide out the batteries for charging but I doubt I could get then out in case of a 🔥.  A small pouch of sand and I could probably at least direct the fire away from the rest of the electronics.

Only opportunity I see for my cells to catch fire while on the road are something shaking loose and wires shorting in the battery box.

This is perfect, dankeschön :) I just ordered two of them and am already feeling better :smile: I'm thinking of putting this stuff in my case between the 3P-Packs so in case of a fire the stuff does its magic before the deck catches fire... mhhhh lets hope its not too heavy
edit: Its 250kg per sqm (max), which would be ok. In my case this would be 250gr addictional weight which is compared to the heavy stuff nothing :)

I carry that Tundra can of extinguisher in my backpack. I have no idea if it would put out a battery fire. Realistically, I carry it becuase I plan to use it to prevent a fire from spreading if I’m next to dry brush. 

@Deckoz do you actually check individual cells often! That seems a bit extreme for most of us. Have you looked into that BMS that uses an app which show voltage per cell (group?)

My new charger shows IR per cell and across the whole pack.... So I see it whenever I'm charging, I'm still getting used to interpreting the numbers with seeing different values from different batteries but still pretty limited experience or knowledge.  If I went with a BMS would definitely want the kind that can report via a phone app.

@Deckoz do you actually
[/quote]

Running two balance plugs, to check the parallel groups ie "cell one" aka a parallel group isn't that hard. Especially when you are just "Learning" how lithium behaves and degrades over time.

- do I really check them every charge? No because I've been working with lithium ling enough to know what to expect
- when do I check the individual groups then? As I mentioned in my last post, understanding lithium, and monitoring your whole pack IR can give you a tell tale clue that a single parallel group is off. Once your whole pack IR goes off, finding the parallel group with an IR that doesn't match the rest is easy.
- but IR isn't voltage so how do you know it's balanced? Simple one of two things will happen, the IR will change, or the battery no longer reaches proper charge voltage. Normally both happen together. At which point back to bullet two. So you measuring IR and pack voltage at every full charge and write it down until you have a baseline of what the IR is expected to be for your pack. 

All ya need is a multi-meter and consistency.

This is why if you build a pack you test IR of all your cells, including voltage. Not that hard to weed them out before building,  really easy to skip this and wonder why a pack is a bum pack.

I've probably charged my battery 50-60 times without any issues. 
Board has done around 1000km total with this pack. 
It's secured with Velcro and added foam between the battery and deck to minimize vibrations. 
Maybe it's good once in a while to remove the heatshrink just to inspect for damage and such. 

Don't know the brand of the bms but I know that it's not bypassed and rated for 4A continuous and 80A burst.
I just seems that people are measuring each cells quite often.. I've never done that and don't know if I should.
