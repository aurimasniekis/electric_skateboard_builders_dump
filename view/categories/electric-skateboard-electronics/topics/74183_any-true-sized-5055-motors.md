I am looking for 5055 motors for a dual street build on Caliber II clones. Does anyone know where I could find 5055 motors that are 55mm long and not 60?

That I know only @torqueboards had them, it's unfortunately that they are gone, love mine

There is the SK3, but the Kv is high, unless you could change it form Y to delta, and it's 59mm in length

If you donâ€™t mind 6355, Keda 195kv fits on 180mm trucks

Edit: or racerstar 5045 200kv
