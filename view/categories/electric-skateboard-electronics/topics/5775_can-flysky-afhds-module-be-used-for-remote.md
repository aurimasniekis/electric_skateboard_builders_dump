I researched a bit and found that GT2B transmitter is more reliable than bluetooth, so I want to use it for making a remote. I found this [flysky AFHDS module](http://www.banggood.com/Wholesale-Flysky-FS-GT3-Telemetry-Module-FS-RM002-For-2_4G-9CH-FS-TH9X-Transmitter-p-66598.html) which I think uses the same technology as the GT2B, and it's half the price. The question is how can I use the module, can I connect the analog sensors (buttons, potentiometer or hall sensor) directly to the module, or do I need to convert the signal to pwm/ppm with arduino first, any ideas? Thanks.
