So i have seen some boards lately (on youtube) that have a feature where when they sit idle too long they go to sleep, like deep sleep. They have an auto on, not from the remoth, but from when u kick on the board (im guessing motor detection?) 

My question is, can the vesc do this, if so how would we go about it? 

Lets face it... we have all forgot to remove our loop key or turn off our boards, this would be a neat feature, especially if its just  a software thing
