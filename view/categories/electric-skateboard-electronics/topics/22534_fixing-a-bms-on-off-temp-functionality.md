Hello I've bought this 10S 60A BMS a while ago connected a switch in series with it's temp switch to be working as an ON/OFF switch and not the BMS seems to work but the temp switch and the switch it's self doesn't influence the behavior of the BMS meaning it's always on.

Nothing seems to be too brunet up and I've been careful with it what component could have failed and how could I fix it?

Thanks for your time.
