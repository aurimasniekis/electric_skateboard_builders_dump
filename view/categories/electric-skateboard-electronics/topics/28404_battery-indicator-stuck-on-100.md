So I rode over some puddles and everything  was dry except the battery indicator on the out side. I noticed that it was at 100% after riding. What do you think is wrong?

Could've shorted. Might still be water in it, shorting something.

If you're able to take it off and place it over a radiator or in the oven for 20 minutes on really low... or take a hairdryer to it for a minute or two.

You probably just have the meter set to the wrong size battery. Follow the manual to set the right amount of the cells for your pack.
