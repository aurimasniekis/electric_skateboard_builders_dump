I'm having a slight issue with my (Maytech) vesc remote settings, ( 2.4 Ghz remote).
When my board is connected to computer and I use the keyboard, the throttle and coasting works good.
 But when i use remote controller, the speed at max is slower and when i realease throttle, it slams the brakes. No coasting when throttle released on remote controller, I appreciate all the help from all you talented eboarders, thank you all.

Did you set the PPM min/max? First disable your control mode, then go to PPM tab and check the "display" box. Turn on your remote and throttle all the way down and look at the PWM value, then input that value in Min Pulse width, do the same thing with max pulse width at full throttle.

Then turn on your control mode and try again. Also, what control mode are you using? PID speed control and duty cycle will brake at neutral

It's under the PPM section on the app configuration tab. Follow the instructions I gave above to find your values.

Yea now check the "display" box and turn on your controller. Throttle all the way down and record the pulsewidth on the box to the right, and put that number for "minimum pulse width". Do the same for "maximum pulsewidth" at full throttle.

i followed the instructions but my numbers arent changing when i hit throttle. I cant find where you tell me to record max number and min number, im so confused. 
im running firmware 2.18 just incase.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/e/4ed0bdb22f274bb3f74742c031e6c23f0d1fd304.JPG" width="669" height="499">

Check the box in the left circle, and check the PWM signal on the right circle

Yep so put those values in the appropriate boxes and write config. Then try your throttle again.

```
You'll have to adjust the trim on your remote. True neutral is the median between your min/max pulsewidth and if your neutral position doesn't match true neutral, it'll accelerate or brake at neutral. Try to adjust your trim to get min pulsewidth closer to 1.0 and max closer to 2.0 with neutral being 1.5

You lose a lot of throttle range if the green bar isn't in the middle at neutral, keep that in mind.

Looks good, just keep in mind you'll lose the difference of your min/max pulsewidth minus the actual min/max of your throttle.

For example if you set max to 1.9, but your max throttle only goes to 1.8, you lose .1 of your throttle. It's best to set the trim just right.

 I hope that someone also learns from this walk through. üëçüòé

Yes, it works as good as any other vesc. The only difference is they put the maytech name brand on it. My other board has a non maytech brand vesc, they both work fine. Check out @psychotiller, psycotiller.com, thats where I bought my maytech.

Not true - don't say that.
Maytech VESCs come without a bootloader which is a significant difference!

They often work fine, but you should know, there are better Vescs available. It¬¥s like you get what you pay for.
Without a bootloader, you have to get a St-Link V2 and upload the bootloader and after that the firmware yourself.

sure but going online and buying an ST-Link, reading up on how the upload works plus performing the upload just to save like 10 bucks? Plus the chances of inferior quality?

@TarzanHBK Ah I had no idea extra HW was needed. I often follow the approach ‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äù so can‚Äôt imagine needing to upgrade the firmware. BLDC mode is working well at the moment.

@Maxid  On the quality front, Maytech have years of experience manufacturing ESCs for the RC hobby market. So if anything, I would expect their quality to be higher than the small "VESC-only" suppliers. This is pure speculation though.

Experience on this forum has shown that these chinese VESCs are inferior to the "established" manufacturers.
Also just because you have the experience to make a good product does not mean you actually do when you use cheap parts of lesser quality to put it together.

I don't want to argue but the heart of your vehicle is in my eyes not the place to cheap out on. Get worse wheels that don't cushion vibrations as good or worse trucks that might make handling a little harder - but the VESC controls the entire thing!

Maytech is fine as long as you don't want to use the latest firmware and cutting edge features like FOC

bootloader is necessary if ou want to update your firmware with for example @Ackmaniac's version.
If you are fine with the version it came with there is no need for you to update.

If you think you always need to do firmware updates fine. Get a boot loader. But give people all the info as to why you think you need it and stop just saying they don't work without it, because it just isn't true.

I got mine from @psychotiller and its working great, i just did a few tweaks, thanks to @Jinra, i'm still new learning the VESC, alot of learning still to come but also, i've built 2 eboards in 5 months and so far so good thanks to this forum, i'm learning something new everyday.
