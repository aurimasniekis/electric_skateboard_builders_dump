Hello,
planning on building a board with the diyeboard 10s5p pack, but Idk what to do for the rest of the board, esc, drive train... I'm located in the UK and need to be able to climb relatively steep hills and it's quite expensive for quality parts. Budget is sub £800.
Thanks!

Got to be straight with you..

Diyeboards comprise quality for cost

800 quid is a decent budget

If you have a 20%- Off code a raptor 2 would only cost 1050 pounds.
That would beat terrible 10a cells for diyboard, and it should be semi waterproof.

I Once had found that code somewhere but I lost it, but by not it's probably expired.

I'm from the South West, Somerset. Thinking of a vanguard board or similar, I'm 6,2 so would like something with decent length. A raptor for £1000 is out of my budget unfortunately.

damn, for 800 pounds you can make a pretty nice board. I would use the search bar and browse through some vanguard builds, there is a lot of them. Good luck and make sure to pick your parts wisely

I've been doing research and it seems hard, motors are usually 100+,focbox 150, batteries prebuilt 300+, deck, 150+,wheels trucks mounting etc... Seems hard without using cloned parts.

Not much choice, explore the whole of Europe. The marketplace here is pretty active can also pickup some parts from there. I personally have a few extra drivetrain parts Ill like to get rid of

Look what I found on AliExpress

Are you sure every motor is out of stock, they have a lot of different ones. They also sell lipos if you want to use that for your battery

Not sure how shipping is but I started off with one of the smaller kits from DIY and has been pretty good to me (also was a few years ago so some things have been upgraded in the kits since then) collections/electric-skateboard-conversion-kit/products/pro1-electric-skateboard-conversion-kit . Not sure how shipping to Europe is for them but got to me in Chicago quickly, the major place you can adjust price is basically the battery, trade off in cost vs quality/range/max amps.

Hmm says shipping is $30 for US or $80 for international might still be a better deal than paying shipping to 10 different vendors and trying to get all the right components
