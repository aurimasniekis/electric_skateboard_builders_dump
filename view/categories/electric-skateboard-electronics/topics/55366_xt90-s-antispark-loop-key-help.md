Hey guys, so I have become tired of plugging the batteries directly into my VESC, so I have committed to creating an anti spark loop key, but I have a few questions. I made a picture for reference.
-Is there any problems I would encounter if I were to do it this way?
-Do I buy the XT90, or the XT90-S?
-Any links to find some cheap XT90-S or XT90 connectors

appreciate any help!

Diagram looks good. You need a xt90-s. I've got some.

Got a link? Also, will the length of my wiring effect anything?

If your wires are longer than 30cm you'll risk failures due to ripple current.

And putting the antispark on the negative side is safe?

Yes. It doesn't matter which side it is but many of us put it on the positive side.

Ok. Do you have a ling for some cheap xt90-s connectors? I am looking to make my own.

You can try hobbyking. They should have some.

Yes, it's literally just one of those with the terminals bridged.

Sorry for being such a noob. One last question. Does it matter whether which sides the wires are soldered on?

(male/female)

No, but it's advisable to have the connector with the green mark soldered on the board. That's the one with the resistor. If you lose it it's game over and hello sparks.

I beg to differ with @RedEagle, since the anti-spark part can fail on rare occasions, it's better for it to be in the "key" rather than in the board, that way if it ever fails, you can just replace it.

@MysticalDork is right, use the resistor side as the key. Also, it's better to do it in the positive leg.

And you can get them on Amazon too, if you don't want to wait for hobbyking shipping. https://smile.amazon.com/XT90-S-Connector-housing-Li-poly-Battery/dp/B06XW63S87/

Hey bro, why is it better on the positive side?
```

```
If it's in the negative side and you get a short without the loop key the negative side could still active as a ground and them the amps flownon the positive.

 Ahhh that totally makes sense. So cut off from the source and prevent ALL issues as opposed to just MOST issues. Thank you.

Iâ€™m of the opinion that accidental shorting the connection is far more likely if you use the resistor side for the key... 

may well not cause any issues but I went the other way round to be safe...

I don't see how, but it's all good. We are all just trying to figure out how to make mountains out of hills around here ðŸ˜€

Just because you end up with the male pins as live rather than the female sockets... I know if they short itâ€™s only connecting the power to the VESC but the little arc when the caps charge bothered me! 

But as you say weâ€™re all just rolling along!

I am confused now. Should I use the resistor side for the "key" or but it on the board?
```

I use the resistor side for the key.  If you use on the board side and it fails, you have to tear into the board and rework the soldering.  If you use it as the key, the worst that can happen is you lose it, but I keep spares.

Some people are worried about shorting the pins if you use the male board side, but I'e never seen it happen and cant see how it would.  

Do whatever you want though, whatever makes you feel safest.

Diagram does not look good because there is no fuse in this setup ! :frowning:

For the rest, I use the resistor side as key and my Anti-Spark is on negative wire and my fuse is on positive wire.

What is this "fuse" you talk about?
