hi

VESC HW 4.12 FW 2.18.
 6S BATT 12A

When I reach the final speed I get cutoff.

another problem:
I'm trying to install a new version again ( 2.18 ) after upload 100% the vesc Disconnects from computer but does not reconnect. He got stuck
Only turn off the battery and turn on again the vesc Connects to the computer without updating
I even tried downgradeto version 2.15. Same problem

Does anyone have an idea what to do?
