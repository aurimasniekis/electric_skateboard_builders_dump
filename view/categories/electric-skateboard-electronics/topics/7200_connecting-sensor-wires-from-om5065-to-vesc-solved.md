I have Chaka's 170 KV motor (the OM5065) and a Vesc also from him. I want to try running it with the sensors connected but the motor has 5 sensor wires and the Vesc sensor port has a 6 pin female jst connector. I have a 6 pin male jst connector to solder onto the motor wires, I just don't know what order the wires go in.

Sensor wires coming from motor:

Thanks in advance!

I have the connectors on order, I'll have a plug and play adapter soon. I'll make an announcement when they are available in our shop.

Any update on these adapters? Or do you just have the headers available?
