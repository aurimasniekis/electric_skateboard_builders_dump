You need one monitor for each battery

I have had that remote... It basically just sucks... The first one I got was faulty and the second one the power button keeps breaking (it is fixable though). AND the battery life is EXTREMELY bad as well!

Agreed. That controller works well for a week, then you'll have to bind it every time you want to ride. Go for the GT2B or GT2E.

I've used those Buzzer alarms to monitor my batteries for a couple of months now and I havn't had a problem yet. They can be a little loud though... 1 buzzer can monitor a 1-8S battery so you will need 1 for each pack for a total of 2.
