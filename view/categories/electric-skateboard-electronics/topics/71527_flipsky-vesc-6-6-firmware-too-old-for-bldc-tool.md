you need to use the VESC tool, not the BLDC tool.
if you want to use BLDC tool you need to downgrade your fw to 2.xx

...more like your firmware is too new for the BLDC tool.

x2 on using the VESC tool instead.  There are some good instructional videos on YouTube.

VESC tool is a complete replacement for the old BLDC tool. Also it looks much nicer and more intuitive (with helpful description on certain parts).
