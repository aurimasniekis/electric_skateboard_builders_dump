Hi there! 

I'm planning to make a Telegram Group for quick questions and answers since there is no mobile app for this forum.
Maybe we also can meet up for group rides!

Here is a link to telegram, I think it’s pretty nice to have a news feed and something like a help chat. I’ll make u guys an admin so you also can take care of this chat!

Bumping the thread, this platform might be good alternative to the existing.chat
