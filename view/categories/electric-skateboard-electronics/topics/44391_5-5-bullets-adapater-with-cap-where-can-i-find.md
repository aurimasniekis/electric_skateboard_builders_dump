That adapter is not for the connector on your battery

Iv'e never seen 5.5mm with housings. Only 4mm and 5mm
If your batteries have 5.5mm bullets you could connect them in series like this:

And unplug them to charge like this

These pics are from my first build

I think ec5 are 5.5mm (blue connectors) and bannanas can come in 5.5 I think...

But yea Ive never seen half mil bullets in a housing or outside of a housing above 3.5mm

I'm doing 3 lipo batteries. So when I connect in series with the 3, they'll be one positive & one negative exposed right ? 

And for the charging part that means I'm gonna have too buy a 5.5mm charging cable ?

If you don't mind spending some money, you could get an iCharger 10s Lipo balance charger and charge all 3 packs in series.

In my opinion, less connectors is always better.
