Normally for a given size you can't have high capacity and high ampere. If really has 6000mha then you can only pull like maximum 800ma from this cell so you need a 20p parallel pack ðŸ˜‚

You donâ€™t get 6ah in a 18650.
And they for sure not high drain.
Donâ€™t fuck with batteries, stay with quality proofed cells like Samsung 30q from a trusted seller like nkon.nl

Fraudulent batteries are extremely common. If it seems to good to be true, it is, especially with batteries. 

Stick with know brands and vendors (Samsung, LG, Sony, Panasonic, Sanyo). 

For instance this is a complete lie, no one makes a 9900mah 18650:

1 of 2 things is happening here

1) It's not actually 6000mAh and its overstated/overspecced like many of the generic cells
2) Like someone said above, maybe it is 6000mAh but the amp rating is abysmal. good luck getting any current to drive your esk8 with them
