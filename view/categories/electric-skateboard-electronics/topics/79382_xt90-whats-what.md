So im having a debate with my dad regarding xt90's.
Which is male and which is female?
Here are the two arguments:
1. the pins are what determines the difference. 
2. the connector that determines the difference.

[poll type=regular public=true]
* Right = Male |  Left = Female
* Right = Female | Left = Female 
[/poll]

Please help this is getting petty.

The male end goes in the female.

Or in this case, *both male ends go into both female ends*

Just tell your dad that his generation ruined the environment, that voting isn't important, there's kids on his lawn, and that Nine-Eleven was an inside job. You'll feel better.

This is a similar debate as "Is a recorded stand-up comedy -- is that fiction or nonfiction?"

Well, it could be a nonfictional documentary about an evening in a venue

Or it could be a series of short fictional stories as narrated by comedian

Lol, which connector gets paid more for the same job? And which one gets mad when it fails to check if the toilet seat is up/down before sitting?

Yeah always base your male/female assumptions on the pins inside, not what plastic has been put over it.

EVEYTIME IN ELECTRONICS.... the PIN is the gender, not the housing. If there is a pin it‚Äôs MALE. No discussion at all.

Yeah, Female/male is always decided on the metal connector inside.

```
The main reasoning is that in a "live" side scenario you always want the female connector to be live. Like your house wall sockets are all female, similarly all batteries have female connectors. The "male" connector for xt90 is at much greater risk of a short circuit if something metal contacts the connector, as there is no insulation between the pins besides empty air.

They are gender neutral. Obviously.

empty air is a pretty good isolator :no_mouth: 
as long as you don't replace that good air isolator with screwdrivers, keys or water you'll be fine

there are pros and cons for both the female and male as the live connector when it comes to anti-spark plugs though, as the housing wasn't designed to be mounted as we usually mount them in our enclosures. Wall sockets were designed for the same purpose they're being used for.

That's the point, on 2 female sockets that are insulated fully w/ material between them, you have to try quite hard to short it out. Where as the male end would be easy. 

Can you imagine if all of your outlets in your house were the male side? Dropping anything metal near a wall, or spilling drinks near a wall would end horribly.

Yes, I can imagine that. Would be a bit more worried about my kids sticking their fingers into those sockets. Spilling drinks on the wall was never my thing üòÅ

As I said, there is both good and bad with using the male/female as the live part of the anti spark plug. If we don't have a 3d printed mount (or similar) for the female, the plug will stick out, which in itself is a risk for breaking+shorts, aesthetically less pleasing aso. 

If we mount the male as the live connector, it'll probably be better mounted, doesn't extend from the enclosure, with less risk of breaking, although if you stick a piece of metal inside or spill your margharita over it üòú that'll probably suck.

And btw.. If you short your anti spark, board will turn on,,, uh. No biggie.

Why does the second option say Right=Female Left=female

I always understood this as the Connector with the Male Pins(RIGHT) is actually the female as its not based on the metal bullet but the plastic housing. 

I still think I am right despite being in the minority. The question is, "Which half of the xt90 connector is male and which is female" Referring to the plastic housing, not the metal bullets.

I feel you and it makes sense based off of overall shape but it is the pins that matter. Not to mention it's an industry standard and the largest suppliers in the world use that denotion. It sucks to make yourself unsee it that way and I still seem them as opposite first. Eventually I had to side with the majority and admit I'd been wrong  for confusions sake.
