This might be a bit off topic but I recently broke my 6374 esk8 motor shaft, (don’t ask me how, I’ve never seen or heard of a shaft breaking) the motor is under warranty but the company is only willing to send me a new shaft. I disassembled an old motor of mine and the shaft was super hard to get out, breaking a magnet in the process. The set screws were completly taken out. Does anyone know an easy way to change out the motor shaft?
