Based off the stats at the bottom of the product, unless you select the rest of your parts around it, it will NOT BE SUITED FOR YOUR APPLICATION

![image|439x500](upload://xp6uoz1oifPpiv57lp3sWyHgstO.png) 

Speaking generally, I don think this ESC is any good at all. 

First, the battery ratings are certainly fudged. No way can it handle 80a while not being cooled, especially for a unit that size. 

Secondly, the voltage required to run this ESC without it turning into a popcorn machine, is fairly low, but 6s Lipo builds do exist... Just depends on what battery you have now

Third, it doesnt have much in terms of programability.... soft, normal and fast are all you get. 

NOT TO MENTION ITS EITHER YES BREAKS OR NO BREAKS

^ This alone, regardless of the other specifications would disqualify this from my personal lists of ESCs, as breaking is very system/user dependent. 

I could write more but :man_shrugging: I think you get the point


Cheap alternatives for ESCs(and VESCS) are:


* The Dual belt motor ESC from own/meep/wow

* The dual hub motor ESC from own/meep/wow

* Flipsky 4.20 (This is a single vesc for a single motor)

* Maytech 4.20 (This is a single vesc for a single motor) 

Or, if you think you can spend a little more money and go for something that has tried and true reliability, you can spring for a

* Focbox (This is a single vesc for a single motor)

* or any 6.xx derivative. As far as I know theyre all pretty good. 

Good luck, to get more help in the future when picking components please use the noob thread, its a great way to receive help.

Here are threads that you can search up ( or just click on) to read more about the ESC, as well as more reasons as to why you might not be able to use it

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-skateboard-build-help-first-project/5185

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/40-80a-6s-hobbyking-esc/3702

additionally I found this non ek8 website related stress test of the exact ESC youre talking about 

http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/?p=1586

I don mean to be rude, but please use the search bar and other resources to do research. Someone on here said it before, but this place is like a library. Read the wealth of knowledge that surrounds you, and then act upon it. 

Chances are, if youre just buying parts that fit the previous, without an overall game plan, you'll likely be stuck with either a board that doesnt function all that great, or a pile of unusable electronics.

I speak from experience, and Im sure others can testify that a lot of forethought should go into planning your builds.

Thanks for the 15 min break... time to continue hammering out my essay :sleeping:

Hey I was planning to use a n5063 270kv motor with 2 3s 5000mah zipply 20 lipos in series. For cooling I was planning to to remove the shroud and glue it to a aluminium plate where the outside air will hit it.

Well, the size of the motor is on the smaller size. Smaller motors mean they are easier to overheat/ can cause a loss in efficiency due to stator saturation.

I would aim for a slightly larger motor, but the size should work.

Im not very familiar with lipos, can you link them? I can either give my thoughts on it, or ask someone better qualified to do so

As for the cooling plate, it sounds like a good idea. Just be sure to seal the edges with some type of sealant.... Water ingress is a factor everyone should plan for, you dont want to be stuck outside

Or just buy this:
https://www.ownboard.net/products/ownboard-w1s-electric-skateboard?variant=13457545494570
Because with that esc you will have a crappy board for sure
