Hey guys!

I was finishing my build and accidentally shorted my DieBieMS. I'm not really good with advanced electronicis so I'm looking for someone in Europe to help me figure out what part was damaged and how to fix it. Everything works except for detection of first cell voltage. 

Also if someone has a DieBieMS for sale ill gladly buy it. I'll try to fix my old one but will need another sooner or later so why not to have 2.
