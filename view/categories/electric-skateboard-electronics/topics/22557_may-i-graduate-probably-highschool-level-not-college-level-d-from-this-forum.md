So finally, after doing tons of research and the help of you guys I finally got everything worked out (I do think so at least :wink: ). 
**I would really appreciate it if you guys would take one last look over my setup.**

Alright so let's get started:

I weigh about 85kg (187,393lbs). I am mostly going to ride my board in a big city so no worries about having to go up to many hills or to steep ones. This is going to be a Single drive build, because budget reasons.

I already got a casual longboard, Paris trucks and Orangtang 80mm Wheels. My budget is about 650-700â‚¬ not including the board the trucks and the wheels.

I plan on using the following parts:

* This [motormount](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/cnc-kit/alien-drive-complete-kits/alien-drive-systems-electric-longboard-diy-kit-63mm-motor/) from Alien
* [Sk3 6574-192kv](https://hobbyking.com/de_de/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) motor from Hobbyking
* I will use the Vesc. I don't know yet where I will buy it. Either from Unikboards, Alien or whereever it is available in Europe.
* Ok so after jumping from 8S Battery Systems to 12S and back and forth I finally decided to go with a 10S Setup. 
I will use this config: 5x 2S 5000mah LiPo in series (similar to Namasaki's [build](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/high-power-10s-lipo-battery-pack-with-bms/10014)) . I choose this [battery](https://hobbyking.com/de_de/turnigy-5000mah-2s-40c-lipo-pack.html).
* For charging I plan on using this [BMS](http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-37v-42v-10s-60a-10x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-267.html) and this [Charger](http://www.ebay.de/itm/Hochwertiges-Netzteil-Ladegerat-Ladekabel-42V-2A-fur-36V-Elektrofahrrad-E-Bike-/351890999220?hash=item51ee5687b4:g:gx0AAOSwnbZYE2U~).
* Obviously I will ned a On/Off Switch as well. I choose this [Switch](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/rc-ev-accessories/electronics/alien-antispark-power-switch-2-14s-120amp-max/).
* My [remote](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/radio-transmitters/alien-power-system-2-4ghz-electric-skateboard-remote-control/) is also going to be from Alien as well.

I think thoose are all the basics and I hope that I did not miss anything. I might add a batteryindicator and front an back lights somewhere, but I don't have that worked out yet.

Alright for all those who made it down this far:

* Do you think this is going to work out?
* Are there any improvements you would make (keep budget in mind please)?

And special thanks to @sl33py and @Namasaki. You guys were of great help!

Alien has these motors for a great price and they are better quality than SK3.
They are precision motors and come with a keyed 10mm shaft so you would need to buy a pulley from Alien to fit.

I like your battery choice, 5000mah and 40c, that 200a continuous and should help to keep the voltage sag under control especially for riding mostly flat ground.

I am not familiar with the APS remote.
I am familiar with the mini RC Remote, They are very dependable and offer great control for acceleration and braking.
And you can get them on eBay from China for less than $20 shipped.

The E-switch on the Bestech bms works like an anti-spark switch.  For me, it has proven to be more dependable than the stand alone E-switches that I have tried. 
It just doesn't include the push button. You have to provide that.  Any 2 pole automotive switch will work

Is there anything that i have to look out for when buying the switch or can i really use any switch?
Because i can't find a 42V Switch

Alright I will let you know. How much would it be in total for me? Because  it is a lot bigger then the BMS i choose. The  height of the bms is more than the heigth of my batteries.

I don't recall what batteries you are using, but the total height of the bms including the heatsinks is 3/4" which is the same as an 18650 battery cell.
Length and width are 4.5" x 3.125"

With the Bestech E-switch, you won't need a high voltage or high amp switch.
Just a 12v automotive switch works fine, just like the stand alone E-switches use.

I would get a round switch though, it's a lot easier to cut the mounting hole in the enclosure.

This is what I used:
I recommend the 16mm. The 19mm is too big.

I would either go with BMS with anti-spark, or one of Vedder/Fechter's anti-spark switches.  Few folks here sell them.  I had spares and all sold now.

I am still a big fan of the GT2b remote vs the smaller ones.  If you have access to a 3d printer you can move it into a small form factor but still have rock solid connectivity.  MasterCho and OKP i think have new enclosures for sale too if you want to buy vs build your own w/ 3d printer.  MasterCho's is really nice (have one), and bet OKP's is as well.  Don't forget badwolf, baby buffalo, and others too you can find on thingiverse for free.

As for the Alien 6374 motor - i'm not a fan of any motor w/ 10mm shaft.  It's a PITA to get motor gears.  The standard is 8mm and you'll find the most flexible option w/ that size.  Finding a low gearing (13/14t) on 10mm is really hard - or $$$ via custom from onlinebelting.  

For a single motor setup at your weight i'd suggest going to 15mm wide belt and gears.  And gear as low as you can to avoid a rocket.  I've seen some community posts w/ 40t gears being sold.  I got some from @Titoxd10001 and really happy w/ them.  He may have some EU options so hopefully he'll comment. 

Wheel sizes and gearing are key.  Wheel size will depend on deck and clearance.  I'm a fan of low ride height and minimal risers - so usually go symmetrical boards like Vanguard.  Avoid drop through, avoid double drop, and avoid super flexy - all doable, just a lot more work.  A good rigid downhill deck is ideal IMO.

GL!
