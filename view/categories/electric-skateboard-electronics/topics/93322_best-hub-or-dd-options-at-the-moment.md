What are the best hub or direct drive options at the moment?

Will take a ready assembled kit also.

Just found that my drive trains ainâ€™t working so well at the moment

Thinking about going for a pair at around $400 maximum.

What is the best option?

PLEASE HELP

THANK YOU

Torqueboards DD is the best at the moment, but it's out of stock and above your budget.

Elofty direct drive is available and cheap, but not sure how it compares to Enertion's R-Spec drive kit (which are hubs)

Hummie has good hub motors, don't know the price off the top of my head but they're better than Enertion's.

Swissboards direct drive is yet to come out yet :frowning:

If you want something high quailty/the best you are looking at 600+. I personally have @Hummie hubs and  they are fantastic... I have heard great things about the the torqueboards dds but those cost quite a bit as well. Hummie is starting a kickstarter soon

Also what ready made belt or gear drive kit is there for that sort of price.

Just think whenever I try building the kit it always ends up failing

even if you buy an assembled kit you'll eventually have to take things apart to maintain it. Hubs and direct drive are the only option for less hassle.

The hummie hubs are way above your budget. For your budget, it's wither elofty drives (near $400) or cheap eBay Chinese hub motors ($120 ish)

You can find information about both drives on the forum using the search tool.

Used parts can definitely be worth it, as far as I know only belts and pulleys wear out over time.

They aren't due sale right now. There is a Kickstarter coming, if you wanna buy. There gossip is that they will be around 650 US but I wouldn't swear to that. PM @Hummie if you want more info.

Use the search bar like everyone else

Carvon has(had) multiple versions of their motors, to generalize won't get you anywhere. Imo, while not being someone who purchased or has ridden then, I think the v2.5s or even 2.0s might be your best guess at a cheaper carvon motor while still being 'reliable'

Here is what I have at the moment.

Abec11 97mm wheels

Unity coming

Hobby king motor mounts (planning on changing)

15t htd5m 15mm pulleys

34t wheel pulleys and 40t wheel pulleys htd5m

Belts

I have tried using Tb motors but kv was to high

Tried using some flipsky motors however they are making some weird grinding sound and are a bit stiff I think the bearing is rubbing against the metal on the outside because when I put some lubricant on them they were much smoother. (Please help with that if you can)

What do you think I should do now

Scrap this setup and by a premade drive kit belt or did or hub

Or just change up the motors and any other not working parts and use this setup

I would recommend you getting some caliber trucks with @Boardnamics or @dickyho mounts.

What kv were your motors? I would think that some 190kv torqueboards or bkb (@JLabs) would work nice with a 15-40 gear setup and 97mm wheels, specially if you are running 10s, 12s would have a fun top speed.
