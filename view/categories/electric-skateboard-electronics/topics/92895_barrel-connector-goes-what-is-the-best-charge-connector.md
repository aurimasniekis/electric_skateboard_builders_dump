I want to explain this is not my proudest moment, but there are a few things to learn from what I did, and also some interesting observations about barrel jacks like this.

So things I learned:

* Do not measure voltage from a barrel port with multi meter probes regardless of how careful you think you can be about not creating a short.

![20190505_142100|375x500](upload://2BTQLWlYWNzBkmMi1IP68te8YVT.jpeg) 

* This is not an anti-spark type connector. I don't think I actually made physical contact between the two conductors, I think a spark crossed the air gap. This is less of a concern when using the actual barrel jack as it uses a plastic insulator to prevent this. However, on to lesson number 3:

![20190505_142034|375x500](upload://iHiIQrpMpAfuqFBdjv4yhxUF2Im.jpeg) 

* If a spark does occur then the resulting ionized air (plasma) will continue to conduct resulting in an arc-flash condition that continues until the internal post of the connector is fully consumed!!! :boom: :fire:

* Most Interesting to me: The resulting chamber that remains and the fact that there is still voltage on the barrel and the little nub that is left... It left a got damn floating plasma ball inside the connector until I blew it out! It wasn't just fire because... I was watching waiting for it to burn itself out... but it was self perpetuating. Cool, my board is now an ion generator.

So what now? Different more safe connector is what. What is the recommended charge connector style? GX16-3?

Honestly, I don't think barrel connectors are safe for esk8 at all.

EDIT: a 5a fuse on the charging port wouldn't be a bad idea either.

In all fairness to barrel jacks, ive never had one fry on me for any reason. The only time i ever really hear of them frying is when people use a multi meter on the charge port, or just lack the knowledge to properly build a battery. In your case it was the first.

You should have taken your own advice... Dont blame a part that works fine when you caused it to fail.

But a fuse is a great idea. On the negative side. Like @b264 preaches. Over and over again.

First off, I already admitted this was my fault.

Secondy, I just went ahead and searched every datasheet I could find on these connectors and they are rated for 20 to 24 volts. So they are being used out of specification, and these are the failure modes you can expect.

That's all I was pointing out. Yeah it ~~probably~~ wouldn't have exploded had I not had a piece of conductive metal near the port. I guess my concern is what if something metal whacked the connector while I was riding.

I mean, for example you could use an XT60 where you should be using an XT90 but you'll only experience the learning lesson after something goes wrong. The connector on it's own isn't the problem it's the application and HOW it fails.

EDIT: I'd like to say that the connector is fine while CONNECTED. The insulation resistance is rated for 500 volts. The problem is the higher voltage increases the potential for the spark. And yes of course, with a good fuse in there the fuse should blow before any appreciable damage is done to the connector.

UPDATE: RIP Multimeter

I've done the same thing, though not as badly, on more than 1 occasion, and it's one of many reasons I suggest to use [fuses](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/576-099707.5WXN) and to never stick multimeter probes in barrel jacks.

Also this, use these

The best connector in my opinion for size and amperage is a gx 16-4, there's 4 pins and each pin set can handle 5a so if you use 2 pins for negative and two for positive you can do effectively do 10A rated up to 1500v AC

^though I don't know how much I trust the 1500v AC rating

```
I'd like to reiterate it's not the current carrying capacity that is the issue here. It's the fact that once you start going north of 36 volts the spark gap starts to become a factor.

The other issue that I really didn't like so much was once there was a spark, because the positive conductor is entirely surrounded by the negative conductor the spark easily propagates into a runaway arc-flash.

What I'm saying is that just based on the fault condition of this connector (of runaway frying itself to death), is pretty extreme compared to using the GX16-3. I've noticed that chargers that are UL certified on amazon all have the 3 prong connector at voltages above 8s, so I'm not really that far in outer space here.

I think the main reason people are picking at me is because yes the fault condition is initiated by poking things where they don't belong. But again, the whole reason I posted this was not because I obviously bridged the conductors. It was because there is arc flash potential with this connector.

That is really interesting. I would have not thought an arc flash would propagate at <50v. I suppose once the air in that relatively small gap is ionized it is possible. 

The big takeaway here is to always fuse your charge port. An xt60 would be a fine option for a charge port?

Thanks for posting I found it is usefull and a reminder of what can happen if you exceed the manufactures limits and just because most people do doesnâ€™t mean you wonâ€™t have any issues. 

In my searches so fare it seems thereâ€™s a few options but nothing ideal yet all have done issue 

Rosenberger magnetic connector
Perfect if it wasnâ€™t so large.


GX 16 4
(Pins rated to 5amp shouldn't connect live)


XT 60/30
(Exposes pins on board shouldnâ€™t connect live)

XLR 
Large connector 

Barrel Connector
Ali exspress takes ratings by playing darts and other people believe itâ€™s true an post it online. You wouldn't trust the 18650 cell rating so why do you trust their barrel rating! (some one pleas prove me wrong with real proper tests over 5 amps)

Iâ€™m planing on using the GX 16 6 pin as sensor wire connectors on next build see how I like the connector then decide if Iâ€™m going XT30 or GX 16 4pin for charge think the locking part might be annoying in the GX 16

For xt60 what do you mean by exposes pins and shouldn't connect live? I would suggest female plug. Don't all of these plugs have exposed conductors?

I don't worry about connecting a charger to a live battery because it is regulated low current.

I feel like you need MUCH **MUCH** more voltage to starting arcing across air. The traces on the vescs are sometimes a millimeter or less apart running our max battery voltages, and it doesnt start arcing, let alone the 2-3~ millimeters from DC post to wall

The arc was created by the spark I made when tapping it with the multimeter. It would have created ionized gas itself, and also sent small metal particles flying through the air.

On it's own there is yeah, NO WAY that an arc can form on it's own. That's why it has that crazy high AC rating.

Maybe it would be worth SCIENCE to reproduce the problem so y'all can understand this thing was like a blow torch for 5 seconds.

Yes, I was thinking a recreation is in order. I wonder what was the resistance of that plasma circuit. I feel like the circuit would not sustain in open air with that same gap. Something about the cavity and cylindrical shape of the barrel jack probably helps maintain the conductive atmosphere.

[/quote]

Maybe it was just a freak of nature thing, but yeah it was surreal to watch. Well, first I was having a panic attack because I was really concerned that the battery itself was going to blow up because this had created a hard short.

But after realizing I had no way of stopping it, and deciding if I should throw it in the bath tub or not the fire finally went out and it was still smoking. But there was a little purple blue ball in there, and I thought, oh that must be the rest of the plastic melting. Under closer inspection, it just kept going and dancing around, so I blew it out and then had a heart attack and died.

If you have seen a plasma lighter:
![image|600x338](upload://67M2bhSna8lZVulR1dxoxQl0iWt.jpeg) 

It looked exactly light that but a little sphere inside the chamber.

Now that I read own post, you are going to think I was on drugs. I SWEAR MAN.

If I had a safe place to do this, I would totally do it again in the name of science. What even is a safe place to do destructive testing of lipos? Does anyone have a giant parking lot I can use? #mythbusters

Those do, however they don't solve the issue with the middle prong being uninsulated.

Also, never use ones with metal caps like that. One guy on the forum burnt his plug down (just like OP) once it touched the port at a weird angle and sparked between the outer housing and the prong.

While the prongs on the inside are uninsulated, there is only a linear arc path as opposed to a planar arc path. (The arc can form in a full 360 degrees around the pin of a barrel connector)

This linear distance is like 4 to 5 times greater than the inside of the barrel gap as well.


Yeah I don't think the metal cover should be used. It would be best if it was a machine plastic with a gasket inside.

They exist, It's a military spec connector, and I'm looking for a good picture of one.

If you want a durable connector Id go for XT60, but make sure its fused and non of your other devices use XT60 so they cant cross streams. 3D print a dust cap. Edit, use a blanked off male plug for the dust cover, like a loop key without the electrical connection.

That's just the problem though. That looks like a NICE beefy port that surely is durable.

The problem is that the female side should be the panel mount version. They're switched.

The side that is always live should not have the exposed pins. The charger should, especially since they're already current limited to 2 or 4 or whatever amps you charge at. That would prevent any kind of sustained arc flash.

I use a dc5.5 barrel connector to charge to 10s at 2amps but I admit I've sometimes wondered about what would happen if it shorted... At the moment I cover the pin with shrink-wrap and abit of electrical tape when our riding. Can anyone tell me where you get those rubber dust covers you all seem to be using?

I've got a similar plug. idk what it is but it looks like a variant of the gx connector.  I've pushed 41.9v @9a through this and it was just fine. It works super good in conjunction with my range extender as the plug never falls out :D

If you have a positive lead and a negative lead coming from your battery, just pick either wire, cut it, and place your fuse inline with that wire. It doesn't matter which wire.

I had these for a different project but thought they had a place in this thread. One is a small panel mount circuit breaker and the other is an amphenol connector. It seems to have the correct orientation. I don't have the flange mount female side anymore. 

Amphenol PT06A-8 series

When you guys say fuse, do you suggest using a fuse even if you use bms for discharge? 
If so where should i put it? after the charge plug inside the enclosure? Will this work? ![s%C3%A4kringsh%C3%A5llare|499x500](upload://bRYqhqN9CVjMjEzJt3c3WfnbYp2.jpeg)

I dislike fuses as if they blow I will have no brake's or power....

Just use a fuse for charging, either fuse the positive lead or the negative lead of the charge port

Nice! I had thought about 3d printing something but JB weld seems to work pretty well too! I hadn't thought about having both female and male on there, that's pretty cool.

I just hooked it up this way because because I just had these pigtails with tinned ends didn't want to fiddle with it, just got it today.
