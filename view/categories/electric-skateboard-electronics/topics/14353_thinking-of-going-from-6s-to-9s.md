My current setup is a 245kv motor, Enertion VESC, and 6s battery.  I was thinking of adding another battery to go to 9s to increase range.  My question is - do I need a BMS?

I'd opt for 8S instead of 9S in your situation, but you don't need a BMS just because you have a high voltage and discharge rating. A BMS is used to charge your board easily; a normal LiPo charger works fine, but I recommend using a charging board so you don't have to worry about switching batteries three times.
