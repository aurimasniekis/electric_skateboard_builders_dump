If you had a choice between both which one would you choose and why?
I can't seem to find any differences with them and don't expect there to be any if they're both made in china but want to know if there's a quality difference in pcbs or if one is more prone to break than the other, etc. 

Thanks

I have only had experience with Torqueboards and so far so good. Used two in this build: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-build-using-psychohubs-10s-sensored-foc-video-added/13847 Put about 50 miles on them so far. I have never bought anything from Enertion and don't ever plan to.

Vesc-X is too expensive for my first build, that's why I'm focusing on vesc-4.12

I have one from each. the enertion is actually 4.10 since it was only the 2nd batch of vescs.
both are working fine. unless you're in a rush you can get one from maytech for 80 on the us groupbuy.

Torqueboards all the way....Especially if you live in the US. Fewer reported failures and solid US support. No brainer.

@saul,
Yeah, I am in a rush. Which is my main issue as I try to get everything in to start assembling. 

@Ulfberht,
Is @onloop not located in the US?
I think they both gave had their fair share of issues based on what I've seen throughout revisions

I've used Torque's, Ollin's and a couple of the chinese cheapies. 

I'm pretty solid on Ollin VESC's being the highest quality. 

I've messed up a couple from both Torque and Ollin. 
One from Torque arrived with a drv issue, but he was really quick to offer a replacement.  Great service!

Ollin is top notch and always a valuable resource for quality parts and information. 

China? safe to say you can't ever be sure what you are going to get or when you'll get it.

Couldn't agree with you more. I've learned so much following his posts on ES and here that I don't know where I'd be without his contributions. I'm extremely grateful! 
@Chaka Love you bro! Thanks again! :v:

Agreed that Ollinboards is the best quality but also the most expensive. That's why I was inquiring about the other 2. Thanks for all responses!

I've bought a Torqueboards as there were a few other things I wanted to get from him.

All the latest VESCs all have higher rated components as well. BTW. Price point stayed the same. :smile_cat:

Did you upgrade to the 4.12 bom... so they won't miss cap c26?

Yeah, actually. I specifically told them to mount C26 but it wasn't mounted. So far though these new ones are holding up even better due to the higher rated components.

You should put up a pic to show how clean they are assembled. They are pretty slick looking.

I'm starting two vanguard builds with dual torque boards VESCs each tomorrow. I'll report how they work. 

@torqueboards I might be requesting support by chat tomorrow, hope you are available =)
