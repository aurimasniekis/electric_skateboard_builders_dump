While your math on the battery setup is correct, that's a pretty small battery pack. Most of our packs are somewhere in the 7500-12000mah 10s or 12s mark, so 6000mah 6s is somewhere between half and one quarter the size of the average DIY pack. You'd probably only get about 8 miles out of that setup.

As for an ESC, based on your posts you probably want the cheapest one possible, so I'd recommend a flipsky 4.12. Be aware though, that you get what you pay for.

Yes. You should spend some time reading through the info sections of the forum, most of this information is already covered.
