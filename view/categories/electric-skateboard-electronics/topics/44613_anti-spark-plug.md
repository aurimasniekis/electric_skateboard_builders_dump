Just started doing my first build. I believe I got all the connectors right but when I plug in the Anti spark plug, sparks happens. Is that suppose too happen ?

Are you using the xt90 with a little green stripe?

Then you're not using an Anti-spark plug...

This xt90 doesn't have the green strip but I do have a xt90 connector that do have one. Should I use that one instead

The one you have is a loop key. Although I am not sure if anti-spark works well with 12s

Yes what you're using provides no antispark

Just check the tutorial on the forum
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-anti-spark-xt-90-loop-key/204

I don't understand how you made an anti-spark loop key without an anti-spark XT90 connector. :thinking:

So just change the xt90 loop only right ? To the female green strip ? I don't have to rewire the series?

You see how you made a little xt90 key. Make another one thats the same but instead of the x90, use the xt90 with the green stripe.

Also if you could reduce your battery lead length, that would be better for the VESC
