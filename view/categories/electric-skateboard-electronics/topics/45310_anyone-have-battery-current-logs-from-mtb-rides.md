Just wondering if anyone has any charts they'd be willing to share of their battery current usage from previous mountainboard rides using one of the various VESC logging apps that seem to be available these days?

I'm in the process of building a dual 6384 Trampa build and thought it would be interesting to see some stats around typical battery usage, particularly peak battery current draw as well as periods of sustained high current etc. 

Cheers :)
