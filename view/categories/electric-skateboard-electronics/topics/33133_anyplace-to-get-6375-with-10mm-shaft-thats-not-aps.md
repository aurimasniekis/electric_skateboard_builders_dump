Hey guys,

I am looking to add newer motors to my board and really looking for 6374 motors with 10mm shaft. I know APS sells them but they have to be shipped from the EU and with pulleys it comes to over $300USD.

Does anyone have any other recommendations? Any help is greatly appreciated.

It helps to tell people you´re looking for an US source ;)

But I am not, I don't mind importing but I would like the price to be fair.
