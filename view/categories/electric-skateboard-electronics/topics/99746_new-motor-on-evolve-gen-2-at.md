Hello, my motor on my evolve gen 2 at is no longer working and im looking to replace it however the only place to buy a new one is from evolve boards usa: https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/products/motor, however it is out of stock and doesnt ship to Australia where i am located. I wanted to know if the current gen 2 motor has the same mounting holes as a 63 motor such as a 6374?, Thanks in advanced for any responces.

If you want to generate some quotes, you can use 12”x6”x6” and 6 lbs to get close.
