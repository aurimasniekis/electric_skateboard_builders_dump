I'm looking into compression holders like NESE modules or WinFly's modular packs and I'm wondering the feasibility of using common flat braid for an end to end series connection.

In theory the braid can have a foam core and have a cell pushed in from either end, reducing the size of a battery to be maybe 70mm per cell on average with less material cost.

I haven't seen anything like it so far so I'd like your opinions on such a design

This is the layout I was thinking of, a 12s4p of any 18650 would be about 150mm x 430mm, each module is basically a tube with 4 cells stuffed in and the copper/foam get compressed in between each block, threaded rods to hold the pack together and an end cap type to hold the nuts and end sections of copper/foam.
