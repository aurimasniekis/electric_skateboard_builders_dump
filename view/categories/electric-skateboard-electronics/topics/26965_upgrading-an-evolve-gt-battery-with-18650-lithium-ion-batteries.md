Hello guys I know there has been another topic about this already but didn't want to hijack it, besides I wanted to do a step-by-step tutorial so others could easily benefit from it.

Step 1:
Remove the 8 screws holding the battery and turn it over:

Step 2:
Unplug the motor phase and sensor wires

Step 3:
Unplug the battery from the BMS, the original battery is a 10S made of 10 LiPo pouches.

Step 4:
Unplug the balancer plug from the BMS and desolder the 4 red wires from the positive lead of the battery pack

Step 5:
Desolder the 2 wires on the negative lead of the battery pack

Step 6:
Get some 18650 Batteries, I used some Samsung 25RI had laying around
[img]http://i.imgur.com/VoKKvJz.jpg[/img]

Step 7:
Use cardboard isolating rings around the posituve lead of each cell in order to have an extra layer of short protection and sport weld them

Step 8:
Spot weld 4 each one of the four leads to make 5 x 2S4P

Step 9:
Bend the pack:

Glue them together with hot glue silicone

Reconnect the BMS and solder the lead wires:

I run into an issue here, @longhairedboy could give me a hand?

I'm getting only 31.78v on the battery plug however if I meassure the pack directly I get 35.66, I'm not sure where the other 3.88v went! 

Meassuring from the battery plug:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/nwS7xIx.jpg[/img]

Meassuring the whole pack directly:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/RToc0hA.jpg[/img]

I took advantage of the procedure to change the faulty Evolve BMS for a the new one from them but there was 1 red wire I left unconnected because I didn't know where to solder it on the BMS, there were no instructions, maybe that's the problem.

I'll update the tutorial once I sort this out.

The red wire should be the #10 balance lead and go to positive on the pack, IIRC. I don't have a unit in the shop at the moment but there are two coming in for this upgrade so i can take a look then. 

EDIT: I just saw your PM about having the #10 already connected. When the two come in i'll look and see where that mysterious extra wire is supposed to go. 

That's how its done though. That's how you make the flexi pack. I also add some 180mm heat shrink over each P group and let it overlap just a little onto the next one, sort of like scales. That allows it to still flex but keeps things nice and neat.

Nice job on the pics. I am getting confused as to what you do after you bend each 2s4p pack. So you put all of them next to each other like in a few pics down, but you never sport weld each of the 2s4p packs together? What am I missing here?

Ahh ok. Why did you use the method of folding the pack like that when you could have done a diagram similar to this?

Thats exactly how I have my 10s4P pack. a possible downside to this is that if you don't have your pack 100% secure the two sides can possible come in contact and short. I kapton'd both sides and put some rubber in between to be safe, but it is a bit concerning :smile:

Cool, I like the idea of the design that @Eboosted is using because it eliminates that risk.

One question for @Eboosted though, can you spot weld the packs together on the sides instead of using a bit of wire? I feel like spot welding them would put less heat into the cells and maybe a bit stronger?
```

@smorto that's correct, i used my method as I once had a short on my pack with your diagram, even thought I isolated the center with cardboard. 

With my layout you eliminate that risk, the only downside is that need of a long positive wire to go back to the BMS, but that wasn't a big problem, however it added a little bit of thickness to the pack, hope it closes good tomorrow. 

BTW in regards the difference on voltage before and after the BMS, I found it to be pretty normal, once you connect the BMS to the ESC the pack voltage was perfect. So don't worry if the unconnected battery has a lower voltage output. 

Step 10:
Use 180mm battery heat wrap to cover the battery

Step 11:
Use a heat gun at 250 Celsius.

Spot welding them will not allow flexibility on the pack, I wouldn't suggest to spot weld them unless you have a Carbon GT deck, the Bamboo GT flexes and will stress the nickel strip in no time.

If your deck is 100% rigid I would say it'd be ok, however almost all decks even the rigid ones flex a tiny bit

I had to modify the enclosure to add 25mm of lenght in order to make room for the the 10S4P and BMS, I've seen people routing the deck to mount the BMS, but as I didn't have a wood router and I have the ability to make enclosures it was easier to just modify it.

Hi, I found this topic when searching about how to make your own battery for an evolve board. I want to travel to India with my board but it seems the battery is too big to take in the plane.
My conclusion was that the best option would be to buy cells in India and make another battery there.
Can anyone confirm that this is the right cell?

The biggest issue you will have is that for an Evolve board, you MUST use the BMS from the original battery pack or you will be stuck in ECO mode.  Evolve does not sell the BMSs.  If you break it, you'll have a hard time replacing it, if you can at all.  Definitely never discard a broken one.

So are you planning to reuse your original battery when you get back home?  Or just use this new one?  Or make yet another battery when you get home?  That could get expensive.

Also 5800mAh is really high for an 18650 lithium ion cell, which is good.  Also not sure I'd like the karma associated with using cells that say "UltraFire" on them

Those are flashlight batteries. They will not work for an eboard, they put out less than 1A each, good 18650's are rated at 20A.

The largest mah of any genuine 18650 cell right now is less than 4000mah so these ones are almost definitely fake.

Also, you're going to need a minimum of 2 cells in parallel (minimum! 4 preferably),  so factor that in to your cost. Each cell should put out at least 15A, so a minimum of Samsung 30q's should be used. LG HG2's would be better, Sony Konion US18650VTC6's would be better than those...

yes the idea woud be to take the original battery apart to use the BMS and probably put it back together when I get back since I probably wont be able to fly with the new battery either.

thanks for the tip. Is that the specs of the original battery cells? What would happen if I tried with cells that have maybe only 10A output? Would the board just be slower or would it risk burning the battery or something?

I'm not sure what the standard Amp draw rating on the Bamboo GT's stock battery is, but have a higher discharge rate, counteracts voltage sag, which means you can use your GT with full power for longer...

With 4 cells in parallel that can discharge 10A each, you just multiply it so that would be a max continuous discharge of 40A, which, may not be good when you're at 40-50% battery and trying to climb an incline or pull away fast, plus it stresses the battery more and they'll die quicker...

I found the hg2 lg cells but they're pretty expensive.
I also found samsung 18650 25R which are only 2500mah but are rated 20amps and 30% cheaper
Now this is the cheapest option : samsung ICR18650-22P which are only 2200mah and rated only 10amps max but they are one third of the lg price. Even if the batteries die much faster, it might be worth trying the cheaper option.

Hi @Eboosted

Thanks for sharing.

I think that 10S4P and BMS will not fit in the EVOLVE genuine enclosure. Even if you look at your photos, the enclosure looks as if nothing has changed.
Where did you change it?

Yes, the BMS won't fit a 10s4p,you need to cut the enclosure and make a fiberglass extension, otherwise you will need to use a router on the deck in order to make space for the BMS.

Hi guys, just finished a 10s4p myself, worked flawlessly. 
Assembled the cells like eboosted and lhb did. 

However after wiring everything, the board doesnât switch on. No blinking switch, attaching the charger doesnât work too. Charger LED stays green. 

Pack has 36V, also at B- at the BMS. P- at BMS showing 31V. 

Donât know how to troubleshoot further, what connections to check etc. 
Any help would be much appreciated!

Thanks!

red wires go to cell pack main positve. there may be two or three red wires runnign back there depending on which batch your board came from. There's always one red balance lead, that goes to main positive. then there is the charge lead from the tiny red connector, that red wirte goes to the pack positive also. Then sometimes there is a third red wire coming from the BMS which also goes to pack positive. 

All of those wire independently go all the way to pack positive.

Thank you, will communicate that to my guy

And I misspoke, 4 of the cells aren't showing up when measuring at the BMS, so we are 3.7 volts low.
This is on a brand new bms

When using an old BMS that has some water damage and has problems with the data connection etc we still get the full voltage though

Very very weird

I have just finished doing this upgrade my self. Mainly because when I started looking in to this only LHB were just starting to offer this service. Normally I would have paid for this kind of work as I have no experience, and are in general not very good with my hands. But being on the other side of the pond from LHB, I decided to learn how to do it my self. I have spend countless hours reading, looking at pictures, and asking a questions or two now and then. I have enjoyed it! I have mainly been getting my info from these resources:

It is not the most beautiful pack out there, but it seems solid and safe enough. Let me know if you see it differently 

I have learned a great deal, and my craftsmanship getting better and better for every glueing, spot weld, solder and handling of tools I have done. So next time it will be more beautiful - but there will likely not be a next time :) But I enjoyed the journey, and think I will do other e-skate building stuff in the future. I have already some in mind and lined up. 

I have done one thing a little different than from others. The jumpers in serial between P-groupes are made longer to take away some of the stress on the wire/solderjoint when the pack flexes. But that became a small issue when trying to fit everything back together, because of extra width nearly all over. 

Battery glued in fours, and nickel prepared with solder.

When using an old BMS that has some water damage and has problems with the data connection etc we still get the full voltage though

Very very weird
[/quote]

I've been in plenty of situations where the voltage readings just lie about available power. 

Depending on what's actually happening, you can occasionally read a correct voltage then lose it all when the potential collapses as a load is placed on the pack. Its weird, but its all voltage and hardly any current to back it up in those cases. I suspect blown components are responsible. Shits broke, that's my professional assessment. lol

Haha okay

I've talked to the guy who does 18650 packs in the UK and he thought that it might be a balance wire or the terminal for the balance wire that is a bit fucked

Honestly if the pack works otherwise flawlessly, even at 9s, I don't think I care thaaaat much.

As long as the bms allows more than eco mode im probably happy, though my battery guy isn't, haha.

He would like to offer the service to everybody in Germany but obviously won't if the only experience he had was that shit is fucked.

a thin or burned out wire can definitely behave in the way we're discussing. I cooked a balance lead and didn't know it and couldn't figure out the weirdness for a long time. Replacing a section of wire was all it took, but damn did it take me forever to figure that shit out when the old volt meter was telling me things that may or may not be true.

Thanks for sharing this, I cannot stress how valuable it is to me because I will try to swap every bit of electronics as well as battery inside of my bamboo GT. It was my first ever electric board enjoyed it a lot but it has poor quality battery and a Bms. Range dropped to 7km also sags from %100 to %50ish on hard acceleration, BMS is shot so I thought I might as well swap everything with better quality parts. Going to use 2 focboxes, Samsung 30Qs, custom made remote and supower 60A bms.

I couldn't change the BMS on my board, it seems my bms is also shot and evolve won't sell me a BMS on its own, they request to have the board on their facilities to perform any repair service, of course shipping my board to USA or Australia from PerÃº is no option at all, nearly impossible.

On the other hand if you decide to use a different bms, you will loose the ability to change modes and could be stuck on Eco mode as the BMS is the one that controls the power delivery and speed

Itâs been a while since I used that remote, but once you get to that screen hold the top button (of the two) and double click the menu button. The posted video by evolve actually is incorrect on how to get to the individual p-group voltage screen. 

But yea, if your board works and noon battery building mistakes aside it might be the quality of cells. I say this because the first time I incorrectly hooked up the BMS air gave me a battery error and couldnât even use the board. 

Let me know if it doesnât work, Iâll be home later today.

Man sorry to say, but your pack looks super sketchy. Especially as you did this fold method you risk that the corners of your nickel can hit the isolation and short out your whole pack.

I have no experience with the evolve remote, but if it shows the individual p group voltage than your battery pack seems pretty out of balance and your bms will not be able to get that back in normal ranges.


Edit: did you as min check if all cells have the same voltage before you started to put them together?

You can charge the individual packs with a 4.2v power supply. You donât need to unsolder anything, just connect the power supply right. Have a look here in the forum, there are others having the same problem. I canât say exactly but there should be a 5v step down module you can use for it and than just connect that to a usb power supply on the one end and the other to the plus and minus of each p pack one by one

Yep, what Andy said. You can balance the pgroups (or drain the others) whichever ends up being less work, haha.  You can charge the individual groups through the balance wires so no need to de-solder anything.  If you have a regular li-ion charger you can rig that.

As soon as the highest p-groups reaches 4.2v it will stop charging to avoid overcharge, all other pgroups will be lower and won't reach 4.2V

you might be able to charge this easily by unplugging the p's with different cell capacity.

for example.

unplug all except c3 + c5, let that charge up to full.

then unplug them all and plug in c2, c6, c9 , let that charge up to full.

then unplug all again, and plug in c4, c8, cA, let that charge up to full.

then plug in c1, let it charge, then c7 last.

make sure you do this with a 2a slow charger, not the 4a just to be on the safe side.

Yea man, itâs a slow process. I forget sometimes you are draining a 4 or 5 in parallel when I get impatient. 

But is exactly how I did it (used a super resistor myself), balanced the 2 packs I was after, then charged the whole battery to get it where I wanted.

Hopefully after all this it all just works, and I'll have a good balanced pack to fly with. I'm building another pack too using VTC6 cells from Aliexpress. They all appear to be 3.9v +/- .1v  . Will use insulators I laser-cut this time too![image|375x500](upload://naixKfwje1OeILY7VYVrvGcJaeE.jpeg)

Thanks.  Next round Iâll probably use fuse wire/nickel for cell leveling fusing.  But the pcbs are pretty cheap (about $1 each) and minimizes any additional heat caused by the solder iron. On top I have tinned braided flat copper wire to make it a flexible pack. 

The PCBs  provide rigidity to each parallel pack and keeps the stress off the welds. Wrapped the pack in fish paper for added isolation

You could but as @thisguyhere has pointed out to me and i have tested myself the copper layer on the pcb is very thin and a very slight pull on the tacked-on nickel will pull up the copper on the PCB therefore i tacked my nickel down and then covered it in solder like in the pics below.

Thanks man, but just to be sure before I overcharge C7. The board charges through the bms wires, not just measuring through them? Why canât it balance automatically then?

I only just noticed your cunning battery layout! Instead of the LHB layout, youâre running your series links along five packs, then up one, and back again. So no massively long positive feed. Genius! Wondering though, itâd be way faster to weld one 30mm wide strip of nickel along the top and bottom of each pack, bent over and tacked onto the PCB than having to cut 80 pieces of 8mm wide strip eh? Any disadvantages you think? ![image|375x500](upload://pL8Z2hDKe8vEXlDZiMuEMpssNrW.jpeg)

Then I test how hard it is to peel it up and off.  Find the happy medium and I went with it.

Yea man. Itâs totally preference IMO. once I got it nailed down I did a few tests.... peeling straight up itâll peel off...  pushing on the side of the nickel strip weld didnât not cause the strip to shear off the PCB. 

I know it was mentioned that it can/does, but when your cells are glued to the pcb the nickel strips arenât carrying the stress and load from flex and twisting etc. with proper insulation  and wrap Iâm comfortable taking the chance. 

TL;DR... if kaly does it with 3mm strips with just two tacks then I can trust it too, haha

There was no need for a precise measurement was just to get an idea.

As I don't have a way to do a clean pocket on the board I was looking at some easier alternatives and the spacer was one of them depending on how tall it need to be.
4 to 5mm is totally feasible and I may even design one in some that help seal better the enclosure.

Sourced from China via Aliexpress, actual cells vary but the price is such for us in NZ itâs worth the risk. The first pack I built with 30q locally sourced which were hideously expensive, and not necessarily any better than the aliexpress items.

Hi, amazing tutorial thanks for uploading it. I'm just about to start building the same pack. The only thing I'm not sure of is whether the series groups should be glued together? As it would stop the flex. I've got the carbon deck so maybe it doesn't really matter anyway. I would really appreciate any advice. Thanks jamie

If youâve got a carbon u donât need the pack to flex
