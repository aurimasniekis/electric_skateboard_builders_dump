Watch this 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-1CZ5wXC4g

do have the servo lead plugged into CH2? and the right way round?

I can't see anything wrong from those pictures but i would have heatshrinked the wires going into the xt90s

also the connector just before the esc and antispark loop looks to be showing a bit of metal that might want covering

If you follow that video correctly and make sure after you bind it, then turn of the board and take out the bind plug, if that doesn't work something else has gone bad

Videos are helpful. Please try to bind it and show the receiver in the video; it helps us help you.

Flip the ESC cable around. The black wire should be on the other side. From left to right it should go: white, red, black

You have it the opposite way.

Turn the TX on first then the ESC, always.

Your Tx and Rx are bound.
It looks like the ESC that's not set up.
You need to calibrate the ESC using your ESC instructions.
This will allow the ESC to understand the end points on your TX trigger throw.

**Do this:** 
The set button is the little round button on the on/off switch

nononono! Its not the **remote** its the **ESC**!
I have done this. Okey I can tell you what to do!

First switch **OFF** the **ESC**, then **connect** it to the **battery** **pack**. **Turn** **ON** the transmitters(controller) and **pull** the **throttle** of the controller **backwards** end position(braking). 

Then you **hold** the **SET** button on the **ESC** and switch it **ON**, wait **2 second** for the **GREEN LED** to begin to flash and the motor make **beep beep**, then **release the SET button and pull the throttle of your controll to neutral also just let the throttle go to middle**. Then you will hear a **continous** **beep** **sound** and see a **red** **Led** **blink** **continous**. **then** click **SET** again and you will hear **another** **beep**!

Now **drag** your **throttle** **trigger** to the **end** of your **front** **position** of the **controller** and press the **SET** button one time and you will hear the **motor** **beep** **beep**.

Lastly **push** the **throttle** **trigger** to the **end** position of **backward** and **press** the **SET** button **one** time, and then you will **hear** **beep beep beep**. **red** and **green** will **blink**, then the **throttle range calibration is done**. the motor can be started after **2 seconds**.

You **HOLD** the SET button while you turn it on, keep holding the SET button until it starts to blink

Try to flip the wires for the reciever if you already havent done that?
It says you shall hold the button until it flashes green(2 seconds it should take).

You see the black on the right side, and if it is in the second row you shall have the channel of the controller connected to channel 2.

Btw what channel do you currently have it on the controller and reciever?
