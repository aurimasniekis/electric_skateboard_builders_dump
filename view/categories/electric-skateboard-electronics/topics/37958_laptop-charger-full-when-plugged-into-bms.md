Hello eSk8, 

I have a problem that I was hoping you guys could help me on. Perhaps some of you have experienced the same issue with your BMS. I am currently using a 44V 48V 50.4V 12S 30A 12x 3.6V Lithium ion LiPolymer Battery BMS from http://www.batterysupports.com/44v-48v-504v-12s-30a-12x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-268.html. I've hooked up everything according to the instructions and added a 3.5mm plug to plug my laptop charger into. 

The charger: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076KJD4J5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

When I plugged it in, the indicator light on the charger remains green (which indicates a full charge). The charger is a 50.4V charger and my 12S Lipo battery is currently at  ~45.7V.

I thought my charger was broken, so I hooked up the output of the charger directly into my battery + and - and the indicator turned Red and started charging. Which leaves me to believe that there may be something wrong with my BMS since it indicates a full charge whenever I try to charge it through a the BMS. 

Perhaps some of you have ran into the same issue with your BMS. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you very much!

Below shows how I hooked up my BMS.
