Hey guys, the micro USB port on my nano-x has recently come off, the port and all of the tracks (except one) are still fine. I’d fix it myself but don’t have a fine enough soldering iron, the channel switch button has also broken and that needs replacing is there anyone with the tools able to help? I’ll pay of course 
Thanks :slight_smile:

Trust me, I've tried to re-solder a micro usb port before. And I had a crazy fine tip.

Don't. It's not worth the time. I'd try putting the channel switch button back on, but the port, no way.

Get a cheap 1s lipo microusb charger off ebay and wire that directly to the battery for charging. Will be a thousand times less work and much cheaper than having someone repair the broken port.

My GTX evolve broke the USB port off.  I bought a new remote and the same thing happen on the new one.  I took both to a tv repair guy and he fixed them both for $35 each  he is in the USA 1107 E bell suite 11 Phoenix Arizona 85022     602 978 8349     No one wants to do this kind of work hard to find anyone out here.  I think he is one of the only guys out here that does it.

he also told me no one uses lead in the soldering due to regulations and that's why mine broke off easy.  He uses lead
