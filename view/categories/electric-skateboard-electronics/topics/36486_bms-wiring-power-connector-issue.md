Hello Everyone, awhile back i got a BMS from Bestech and all the components to put it together over the winter. What I realized is the connector on the charger is different than the one that connects to the BMS. I was wondering if anyone knew the correct connector for me to use to make it compatible along with how to wire a new plug on the end? Think it might be a 3 pin XLR but not sure. 

Here are some pictures.  The charger is on the right and i would prefer not to change that if all possible.

See if this one works for you. What I have done is bough a pair - female and male version of above and changed the one supplied with my charger. Easy!
