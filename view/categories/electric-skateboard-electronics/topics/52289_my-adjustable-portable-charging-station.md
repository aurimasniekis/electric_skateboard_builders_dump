Hello guys, this is my charging station, I've been using it to charge all my boards at home, depending on what board I bring, I have some that are 10S and others 12S, some of them have the Battery Supports BMS, on those I charge only up to 41.5V to avoid loosing brakes on full battery charge, on my 12S setups I set EOC to 50V and it's dead on, pretty precise.

Hope you guys like it and find it useful if you have several board setups.

I'm looking for a 3D design for my Drok voltage regulator if anyone has a design I could print locally please share it.

BTW here is the link for the stepdown voltage regulator, on case anyone is wondering

Very nice. Should consider building a case for it as well!
