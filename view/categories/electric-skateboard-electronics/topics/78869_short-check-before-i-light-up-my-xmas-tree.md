I agree, just make sure to keep everything nice and tidy!

Chafing balance wires and other connecting wires is a common point of failure

Watch for shorts between p groups, look at this @TowerCrisis image showing how easily this can happen.

Yep, I've seen a lot more batteries nowadays that isolate the P groups with fish paper. As unlikely as it probably is, I think it's an unnecessary risk to have the cells in direct contact.

But since the pack's already done, I'll say it's fine.

I will say, good on you for heatshrinking your balance wires and using fish paper between them and the cells at the connection. Also A+ for silicone adhesive instead of hot glue.

I'd recommend having one big heatshrink around the whole pack.

How exactly did it happen?

Slight flex / vibration could cause the thin crap cell heat shrink to erode causing a big ass short.

That's a pack I'm building for a friend, my own pack is a 10S6P as well though. I've thought about it as I have to break down my pack soon anyway, but I think I'm just going to build my second gummy Carver as 12S and call it good.
