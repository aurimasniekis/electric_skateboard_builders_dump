Like the title says. I'm wondering what things you guys have come up with to keep your VESC as safe as possible from damage e.g against the rattleing, dirt etc

Heat shrink, hot glue, and industrial strength Velcro to attach to enclosure. Been working great for a while. I also lay down and glue a dampening pad to avoid as much vibration as possible.

I use some sound board foam for my TQ 12S esc. Works fine with Velcro.
