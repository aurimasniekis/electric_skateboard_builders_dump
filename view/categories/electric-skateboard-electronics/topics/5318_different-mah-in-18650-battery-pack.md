Hey i have a few different laptopbatterys laying around but they have different mAh on them. One is 4800 mAh and the other one is 4400 mAh. Do you think I can put them together in one pack?

You should never mix batteries.

But if you're going to anyway, treat the whole pack as if it were made of the lowest rated batteries in the pack.

Thank you!

I will open them and then test them. Still thinking about just to try lipos, because i donÂ´t have a spotwelter.
