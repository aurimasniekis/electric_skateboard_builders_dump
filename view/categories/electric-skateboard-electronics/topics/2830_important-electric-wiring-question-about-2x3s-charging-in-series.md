Hi. I am wondering, does anyone know what current balance cables can handle? I am running 2 3s batteries in series, would this diagram work without problems?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/46ceb1a735c7c921fe691534cbd454e96a562019.png" width="291" height="500">
I am buying [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/201533858698) adapter, and it says it can handle 5A. My charger (imax b6) isnt listed as supported, but I don't see why it wouldn't work.
I want to balance and charge the LiPos without disconnecting anything. The charger I am using is Imax B6 that can:
Circuit power: Max.charge power 50W / Max.discharge power 5W
    Charge Current Range: 0.1~5A
Can the balance leads handle 5A? I won't be able to go over 5A anyways if I charged using the bullet connectors.
Sorry for so many questions, I just don't want to screw this up.

I wouldn't suggest using the balance wires for anything over 3A. If you use that adapter you need to modify it as it will burn out if you leave your batteries in series.
