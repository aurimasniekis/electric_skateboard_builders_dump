Hey guys I need some help, completed rebuilding my board a bit, conected everything back toogeather and now I have no brakes. No changes to to the vesc was made, I did re-did a few wires here and there, but nothing major. My brakes just don't work, I get throttle and back pulsewidths, but the vesc just blinks with red lights while braking, but no acctual brakes, what's the deal?

I re did everything before quostening the situation. So it works fine with out the antispark-push to start switches, Wich is somewhat busted, explains the situation. I do have a new one coming, so the problem will sort itself out eventually.
