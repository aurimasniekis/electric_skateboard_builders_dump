Trying to change a parameter on the esc. Initially computer recognized the USB link and esc link- both green lights. When I pressed the read button it gave an ok indication but no variables were shown. I then chose the firmware update button. There were no options for the hgm file it was seeking. When I looked under all types of file options I selected a choice that did not end in the hgm selection. It started to update and stopped at 80%. 
Now it says LINK NOT ESTABLISHED no matter what button I push. The worst part is that even when the wires are reconnected to the esc's nothing happens. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/9/e9f73d99cb209077ca42854b93d673cb4ed7db6a.JPG" width="374" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/9/e9f73d99cb209077ca42854b93d673cb4ed7db6a.JPG" width="374" height="500">

I've lost one FVT 120a after trying to update, it got "bricked" :( It is waiting for "solution" now and I bought another one but I'm not touching "Update Firmware" button :)

They were bricked. Bought two new esc's. Everything now working. Brakes aren't as smooth as the vescs but as least the board is moving.

Just bricked mine :( A quick googled and I found something about a program called BLHeli? It seemed too intense for 1am troubleshooting..has anyone revived a bricked FVT yet?

You can flash silabs chips via C2 programming if youve bricked the 1 wire bootloader. Fyi...

And you can build a c2 programmer with blheli suite.
