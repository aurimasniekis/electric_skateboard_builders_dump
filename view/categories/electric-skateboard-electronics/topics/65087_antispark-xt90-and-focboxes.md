Some help needed.
I have the battery with regular xt90 and xt90-double xt60 adapter. And my antispark pcb button still not delivered. 
Can I use xt90 antispark between battery and adapter to power up the whole thing and not fry everything?

A xt90 antispark should be enough
How the name said itâ€™s also a antispark
Just not so nice to switch on and off
