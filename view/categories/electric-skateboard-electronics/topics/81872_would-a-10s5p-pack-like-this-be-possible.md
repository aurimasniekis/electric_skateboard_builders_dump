Would a 10s5p pack like this be possible? (i know its possible but way to hard speaking) and have I been dreaming too much?

since this tb rocket only fits 9 cells wide the p groups would all not be the same but none the less it is 50 cells.

@psychotiller @torqueboards @hyperIon1

Gonna strap my tb DD on these when i get em, thought bigger would be better on a build like that.

Can you raise the end cells in each row and get 10 that way?  Or rotate the 4 columns on a side to fit them that way?

just trust me dosdent work. each cell is 18mm wide so 50 cells 25 per collum would be 450mm which is equal to 17.71 inches which is too long.

the deck has a cutout if you can see and i need to fit my eswitch within that.

Same height but a little narrower... everything is to scale

40x17.5 vs 40x16.4 cm

Yeah than the original design is more compact anyways it wont matter because im using a enertion eswitch so there will be no need for a bms

dave is working on my 10s4p pack wanna see if he can turn it into a 10s5p, really want to say ive used a 10s5p before lol

maybe or your design. depending if @psychotiller :wink: can change my pack from 10s4p to 10s5p and if he can do that I wanna see which one is more convenient for him and if he cants do it than ill just stick with my 10s4p :sweat_smile:

too bad he broke his bones...

hehe you'll rethink that decision, solder just dosdent stick well trust me (i tried it with 30 hg2's didnt go well) and it degrades the battery by a preety decent amount

Banked a bit to hard to avoid the road and the wheels hopped over the asphalt/concrete transition...rolled onto my back and the corner of the case has a tiny crack to show for it...lost all 3 of my mechanical pencils so I had to use a normal pencil like a peasant

Sure!  Just make sure each P-group gets two of the brown cells and three of the green cells.

That was a mock up... I never mix cells of different ages or different capacity.

I'm guessing 30q and 25r don't work well together...

Soldering the cells does work; you don't HAVE TO spot weld, but it's highly, highly recommended

They would work together if matched in the P-groups, but it's not recommended and I'd make sure to have a very robust balancing system (at least 150mA) if you did that.

It's far better to use the same make & model cells for the entire pack, and the same age cells.

Yes.... I used 100 grit sandpaper

@b264

The pack that I have at psychotiller is a 30q pack 10s4p around 3 discharge cycles so it would be fine to add 10 new cells.

With 3 discharge cycles it shouldn't be a problem, as long as you have a BMS that balances the cells

Or you can get them from certified S&R agent. Just FYI that switch setup is going out the door so if you happen across one that still works grab it.

Loopkey is the best, there's almost no way it can fill, but I used this combo because it's the only switch slim enough to fit in my intergrated deck lol
