Im looking for a remote thats like the boosted boards. I want it that size but i dont want the torqueboards one or the winning one as firstly there both gonna take years to come ha and the winning one is like so unreliable. Anyone ?

You should probably wait for the new enertion one, or a custom gt2b 3d printed enclosure

Where do you live? Maybe there's someone selling one near you. You would have to buy a gt2b somewhere like hobbyking and then replace the enclosure. That's not really convenient in my opinion. The torque boards trigger one should be pretty reliable, and torqueboards isn't the only one selling those, @JLabs may have some, if you live in US.

@ajaynagra is doing a group buy for the little trigger ones, maybe he still has some to sell. I think they are the best you can find, in terms of reliability and size. And only cost 30â‚¬

greatscott's DIY Electric longboard build video had a pretty cool remote that he built out of a Wii Nunchuck

What I use. No comparison for me since I like thumb control
