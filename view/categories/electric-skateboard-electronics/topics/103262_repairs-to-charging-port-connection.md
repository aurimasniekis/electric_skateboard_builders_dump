I need to resolder a connection on my charge port.  The charge port is still connectec to the battery and the connections are under shrink wrap so I would prefer not the pull this all apart.  The battery is charged.  Is there any danger in doing this as is-  or do I need to disconnect?

I would disconnect, even just desolder the positive connection and heat shrink it so you can repair your charging port, then reconnect the positive so you dont have 150A from a dead short going through your body.

Whatever you do donâ€™t have it short out the bms/battery, make sure any exposed      Pole is isolated with tape when soldering

maybe add something like an XT30 inline (and a fuse), so you can disconnect the battery from the charge port.
