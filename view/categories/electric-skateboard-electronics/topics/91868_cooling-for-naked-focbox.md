Planning to buy a naked Focbox from @AlanZhou and was wondering what my cooling solutions might be.

I've seen plenty of heatsinks for Focboxes that already have the aluminum housing, but not for a naked boi. In my searches I read something about the fets being conductive and not to install directly to those, but want to make sure where/how I should be installing one.

Alternatively, if anyone has the original enclosure for sale, let me know.
