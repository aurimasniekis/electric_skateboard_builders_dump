Just wondering if anybody has experience with Frankensled lights using the go-pro mount on a helmet. What are your thoughts on the kit? Besides it’s costing 8x that of a $25 amazon light. 
Background: I plan on commuting using my esk8 in the future and I go through some pretty dark areas with less than ideal road conditions and rail crossing not to mention the zombies lurking around the road leading up to my plant sight. So basically, I don’t mind an additional expense if it’s a truly quality build with exceptional performance and durability.
