So you made a thread about a problem you may or may not have, that may or may not get resolved to your satisfaction and that you may or may not update depending if it gets resolved or not?

Sorry dude but...

At least we now know the issue that caused your VESC 75/300 and the replacement unit to blow up. Benjamin will see if he can fix the unit. Hopefully the GND-Loop via the AS5047P sensor just fried the STM. Blue light still on is always a good sign...
