So I have a Lacroix, not very happy with the remote. But here it is, I want to learn what I need to learn to build my own board. I hear the Lacroix is a great board for me to do that with. I can build and or upgrade what I already have. 
So I did order the new Nano, however, I was going to buy a Hoyt St Puck for future upgrades but I just noticed the Maytech V2 Waterproof remote that looks awesome. 
So I'm coming to the pros to find out what they think

I think you should consider the ossr remote

Just Google

osrr-a-high-performance-open-source-racing-remote-for-esk8

And click the third link

I don't think you can go wrong with the Hoyt puck if you're after a working remote right now with no wait or bullshit

I freaking love my waterproof maytech. I rode it in a torrential downstorm yesterday with no issue. I love the 2 separate triggers for throttle and brake. I love the wireless charging (I have an s10+ so I can charge my remote with my phone hehe). It is a solid remote and has taken several spills very well. 

At the same point, I know a lot of people who like the Hoyt. The maytech is newer and has less reviews. I can even control the maytech with gloves on.

I'd recommend getting it without the charging pad. You can find a cheap one anywhere and save a few bucks.

Can confirm the Hoyt Puck slays. I can't wait for the $100 plastic version so I can buy a second for my other board that my fiance rides.
