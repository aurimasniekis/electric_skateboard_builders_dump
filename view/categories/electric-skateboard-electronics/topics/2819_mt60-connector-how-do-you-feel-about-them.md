If you switch all 3 motor cables, will the motor change direction?

I didnt know about them. im now looking to see if there is a 5mm option for high voltage set ups.

Yes you've been hiding this, i'm not a fan of bullets. This is clean.

Not sure if this will fit through the raptor slots

huh, robotshop has them

no 5mm option that i see but a 3.5mm one should do. 10awg is 2.5mm

Sick! Thanks for the find and the info. Got 10 on the way for all my boards. I hate bullet connectors.

in my experience it doesn't matter which two you switch. That's what's so spooky about it. I can't tell a, b, and c apart at the base of my trucks after i do my inlays and the ESC is in the box. When i put my box on and the wheel is going the wrong direction, i flip any two of them and it works. But maybe in some way it works out the same way because there's only 3.

also these connectors make me feel funny inside. Or maybe it was all the soda i drank today.

Looks like an extra chunk of plastic that could rattle to me.  I'd rather do bullets and then hardwire when I'm sure of what I want.

I like the idea, but it makes swapping two wires impossible without a soldering iron. ALSO These plugs don't allow you to rotate the connection position and (correct me if i am wrong) means that won't change the motor spin direction either.

So they are not suitable for motors.

well i wouldnt go that far, if you're still messing around with your build set up maybe not but if your done and want to make things a little cleaner i would say they're perfect.

I don't mind soldering anything to switch wires my iron is on basically on all day anyway when I'm working on stuff. 

If you don't want to solder to switch stuff (i don't see why not)

 you could program a reversal easily with your esc
Or just chop the little line off in the connector and it'll rotate in whatever orientation you want

but does that change the motor direction?

Oh yea good question. When they come in I'll do it and let you know.  I'm sure someone smarter than me on here knows the answer.

I could see these on your raptors. I'm sure it's eaiser than bullet conmectors. Unless your motors already come with them

I like them, nice and clean. Get it right the first time because they are a pita to solder

This is awesome ! Do I understand it correctly that thanks to these connectors there is no need to solder anything ??  I put three vesc big cables in this connector and on the other side I stick the motor bullets in it. 
Is that right ?

I bought MT60 in black will try them out as I am bit tired of bullets, for longboard current consumption it should be more than enough

its weird that this thread came back to life. I'm starting to use these on my deck-to-esc connections. Still using bullets on my deck-to-motor connections.

I will use on motor to case when back to bullet to esc, I had enough of times than one phase wire gets disconnected but that's I guess not an issue for like deck mounted bullets or etc. But I think MT60 is more than enough for our loads, as we don't pull more than 60A longer than to melt plastic or etc... I mean look at focbox wires :D

I've seen this connectors before and aren't they used by Evolve? I took mine apart yesterday and they look very similar. @longhairedboy can you confirm? 
Another good option;

Evolve is using MT30s IIRC. They're definitely smaller than MT60s. 

There look like they may be pretty useful.

Those look nice but looking at the name I assume it can only handle 30amps we need at least 60amp connectors.
