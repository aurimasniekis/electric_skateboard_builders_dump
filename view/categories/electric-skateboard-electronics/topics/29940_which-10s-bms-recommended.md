Im going to build a 10s4p lithium ion battery made of Samsung 30q cells. Does anyone have a recommendation for a suitable, safe, trustable and tested bms? Is there affordable options that ship to Germany? Thank you in advance for any kind of help.

And ebay is affordable

Batterysupport BMS are HUGE if you go over the 80AMP one.

Ok thanks. I just checked on the batterysupports.com website and shipping is overkill. Like 76$ !! :frowning:
What about bestech bms where do i get those? Im always a little sceptical with ebay as i dont trust most of sellers there. Got lots of shit buying products with false advertised specs and on and on.

This is the one i got. You will have to mail them and ask for the bms. Keep in mind that they only sell min 2. So you will get 2 BMS for ~ 100$
