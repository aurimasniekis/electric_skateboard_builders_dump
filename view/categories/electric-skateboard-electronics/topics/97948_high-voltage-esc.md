How high can the VESC go? Are there alternatives for higher voltages? I need a bldc motor driver for 20s to 28s voltages.

Then you should wait for this :-) : https://forum./t/some-new-focers-84v-vesc-6-based-controllers/1513/191

Stock vesc, can only handle max 12s

[http://www.grepow.com/page/high-voltage-battery.html](http://High Voltage Battey)Energy density is a parameter of the energy storage capacity of a lithium polymer battery. It is the energy per unit volume or unit weight. It is the product of the nominal voltage and the capacity of the lithium battery divided by the volume or weight of the battery. Based on the limited space and weight of the power supply, the battery energy can be boosted by increasing the charging voltage and the nominal voltage can be raised from 3.7V to 3.8V or 3.85Vï¼Œand the full power can be increased from 4.2V to 4.35V or 4.4V. The method has the capability of mass production, and the battery capacity can be increased by about 15%.
