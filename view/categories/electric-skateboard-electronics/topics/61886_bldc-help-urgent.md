Hello, I bought a vesc from tourque boards and cannot seem to get the BLDC to work.  I believe I have the older version of the BLDC installed? My vesc is V:4.12 and has 3.38 firmware installed on it. My whole board is ready to go I just need a BLDC that I can actually use instead of getting "firmware is to old" messages

Well if you have vesc tool it will update... If youre trying bldc tool with 3.38 I think it thinks its too old but really bldc tool doesnt work with 3.38 so...... Download vesc tool instead... Its free as well
