Hi everyone 
I want to test a new configuration for my battery like see pictures the red think will be a wire 12 gauche and the connection for the 4 cell will be 2 nickel strips one 0.20 and one 0.15 8mm 
Iâ€™m wondering if I need to add more nickel strips 
Let me know what you think

The second picture is how you should build a pack. Should the center divider ever break down, it's no big deal as they electrically touch already. The top will work, but needs a lot of insulation and makes a bulky and short prone pack.

ive done both, top (which is a diagram I made btw, hehe) is more convenient, but yes you have to insulate the two halves very carefully. 

bottom is not my preference as I don't like folding nickel.


but either works. 

top one requires more caution.
