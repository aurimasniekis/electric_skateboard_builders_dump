Only covered a few kilometres and the remote has frozen. Screen is stuck. Not responding. Board not moving. Can't turn it off either. TheLED on receiver is on. VESC are  on. First time out.[20181215_103313|281x500](upload://hNNrlql7d5F8Q2XzPh6xX5AdjUw.jpeg)

Open the case, remove the pcb and unplug the battery. It should reset and power up again holding down the left button. Let me know if that works.
