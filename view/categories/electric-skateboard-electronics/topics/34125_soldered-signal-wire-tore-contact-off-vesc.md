I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to connect a signal wire from my receiver to the vesc without going through the traditional contact point. I accidently tore the signal wire off the vesc and it no longer gets signal. 

If any Vesc guru knows a way for me to get back on the road, It would be greatly appreciated. I've been looking at the pcb layout on github, and it seems like I could possibly connect to the innermost pin on the program/debug port.
Thanks,
Rourke

The issue is that when the signal wire pulled off the metal contact came with it. I do not get ppm signal anymore from that contact point/port. I am looking for another place that I could solder the signal wire to.

Scrape the trace going to the missing pad, tin it, solder, done
The pad ripped off on both sides of the PCB?
You can solder to either side...

When I do this the pulse width on my other vesc stops reading. When I unsolder the connection, the other vesc works again. I still cannot get any signal to the vesc with the torn tab.
