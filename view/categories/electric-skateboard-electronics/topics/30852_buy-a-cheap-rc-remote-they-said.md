Gt2b with mad munkey case mod

Had a pretty good fall today. I swapped packs and rode around for maybe 30 seconds. Went to turn around and noticed I had no throttle. It was extremely brief. Maybe like 3 seconds. I didn't have time to check if the tx lost signal or not. I was kind of playing with the throttle while this happened, I had it around half throttle and it connected back up, I think just reaction caused me to full throttle after it jolted forward and my board ripped out from under me and body slammed me, I went up in the air completely and fell straight down haha. Also broke one of the fan blades on my max6 esc from the slam I think

I've actually had this happen before. Maybe like one or two times but I thought it was just a fluke. This last time I now know for sure it's some kind of signal issue. 
This is a big deal for me, as it can cause some serious injurys if I were going at a faster speed.
I've rode my board probably 150 miles and it's happened 2-3 times.

I'm just wondering at this point where to diagnose or what I can do to track down this issue. Faulty antenna? Messed up throttle pot? My esc wires are soldered direct. Im going to open the gt2b up tommorow and check connections. I might buy a new gt2b and just use it stock to see if the issue is within the modded one currently 
Thanks for any input

Ya I'm not sure what it could be man. There's so many variables. Everyone on this forum swears by it and says it's the most reliable. When I used to rc I would use very expensive futaba radios. I would have no problem spending 300 on a nice radio/transmitter. Only reason I went with this is because of the reputation. (Granted it could be a faulty connection somewhere on my side still) I have a friend that said he's had issues with fly sky radios in the past

IÂ´m using the Gt2B by myself, normally its a really stable and safe connection.
Have had problems with a slightly damaged antenna... it was a little bend, far away from snapped complete just the outer hull, used some heatshrink but get some bad signal drops ...
I swapped the reciever to new one and secure the antenna twice...
No more problems
If you are unsure what it cause i would swap complete remote and reciever... No fun as you said and really dangerous!

Been using the same Gt2B for two years now in a Bad Wolf enclosure and have never had a drop out or really any problems. I also use the Gt2B for my RC car and it's been great for that as well. Sounds like a faulty TX or RX.

1. Is your fail safe correctly set and tested?
2. Check the antenna of both receiver and transmitter, they can easily be broken off from vibration. The remote will still function but range is reduced and interference will be worse.
3. Remote is fully charged. It can still work at low battery but can act a bit funky. 
4. Receiver antenna location, the silver bit at the end should be far away from motor wires, battery wires, esc etc. Preferably not under you foot either. Water (blood) is good at blocking radio waves.
5. PPM wires should not wrap over motor wires. I had a case when accelerating up hills the high amps would cause a drop out. 

In future if you detect any drop in throttle or drop out reduce throttle to a neutral or a low level to it comes back. Should only be a few seconds. Pushing it up and down is dangerous in this situation. 


I still think the GT2b is still the most reliable radio link but its not 100% fool proof or totally un fallible.

great replies guys. thank you!

@lrdesigns
1. i was wondering about that myself, for my max6 esc's. i didnt see anything in the manual about setting the fail safe. if i turn off my remote, the board will just free coast.(also very dangerous). i deffintely need to look into that.(edit, just realized that the fail safe is within the gt2b:open_mouth:)
2. i will check out both those items later today
3.remote was fully charged
4.the antenna is just wrapped up in my reciever box(attached photo)
5.now here is something..lol(attached photo) my reciever is in my reciever box on the back end up the board. BUT i also have a battery capacity meter direcly mounted inside that box, very close to my reciever. the power wires for that meter are only 22 gauge, so there isnt any high amps going through it but its still running out the same chase as the ppm wires. very interesting. and yes the smart thing to do would be to not touch the throttle, i just wasnt sure what was going on. man it hurt too. my body aches because of it haha

[/quote]

What happened to the thread it totally broke off the rails. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Yeah I think that's a pretty good location for the receiver and I don't think the battery meter would cause interference issues apart from blocking if the antenna is under it.  If you want to be ultra sure you can drill a tinny hole and just poke out the silver end of the antenna. Add a dob of hotglue to stop it moving or water getting in. 

Yeah the fail safe is a function of the GT2b receiver.  Basically you have the board and remote on with throttle set to neutral position, then you press the little button on the receiver for a few seconds. The LED should flash and then the fail safe is set at neutral. If you ever loose signal the receiver will send neutral throttle position to the vescs. Just note if you adjust the PPM end points in BLDC TOOL you will need to re-set the fail safe. Or if you adjust the trim pots on the remote the neutral of the fail safe will be off.  

You can then test the fail safe by holding full throttle and turning the remote off. The board should go to neutral throttle position.

hahah right. no worries. ya i was actually thinking about doing that with the rx antenna, eveything else looked good, ppm wires all nice and tight. i redid my rx antenna kind of. i had it taped up with the brass pin thing thats on the end of it. i took that out and just left the silver part by itself in a safe position. didnt really think the battery meter would cause issues, i mean it is right under it with 8s voltage feeding it but no crazy amps going through it. im going to stick the antenna wire through my box and see if that helps. then if it happens again, make sure to look at my rx to see if the lights are flashing i think? that means loss of signal?

Yeah it will flash with signal loss, but I have found that it will reconnect in a second or two and the flashing will stop, so your unlikely to be able to see that while riding.

Stock GT2B I probably have ridden 2-3k miles with no issues at all (in the past). Probably a basic fail safe, running on low battery were my only issues and the huge form factor. Other then that they're pretty rock solid.. IMO

I've never gotten a failsafe on my GT2B, but I HAVE had some interesting issues where the failsafe position that I set... Uh.. _changes_. Sometimes it goes to a bit of brake, sometimes a bit of throttle. My PPM range is pretty large, so it's not a clock-accuracy problem or jitter, but I think I may have had the fail safe button pressed by something in my enclosure. I adjusted some stuff, and I don't think it's gotten reset since.

Reguardless, I keep a long wire on my loopkey and have it where I can reach and yank it if necessary. I never trust my board 100%. XD

My RX is over the VESC capacitor bank, and the antenna is zip-tied to the power lines just behind that. Haven't known it to have any interference issues.

make sure the connection from receiver to ESC is very solid. I had several of the same problem with my remote recently but only on rough roads with lots of rattling. the problem every time was solved by fiddling with the cable from receiver to my vesc. I now have tape there holding the connection in place and have had no problems. i am looking into a permanent heavy duty solution.

I had the scariest wipeout happen because my GT2B-madmunkey went full throttle out of nowhere whilst I was riding. The problem turned out to be the throttle potentiometer which appeared to be working fine when measured with a multimeter, but was apparently damaged from re-soldering causing the controller to go full throttle under certain conditions. I replaced the throttle pot with the steering pot which made the controller reliable again for about a month now.

The thing with these mods is that they dont tell you that you dont need to (and absolutely should not imo) remove the little pcbs from the throttle pot. The pcb allows you to resolder without damaging the pot with heat. Also, I found the stock wires used to connect the pots to be very poor quality, I replaced with much beefier wires.

If you want a compact remote I advice buying the mini, which is 23$ on ebay, cheaper than the GT2B, and compact as-is.

I thought that the pot for the stearing was not the same as for the throttle (different values) but you had not problems in re-calibrating ?

True. I didnt reconfigure the vesc, I only turned the trim knob to make sure its neutral if you dont touch the throttle. The throttle now only goes to about 70% which is plenty for my build, brake range of motion is much larger in the madmunkey mod, so I almost have 100% brakes without re-calibrating. In fact, with the original throttle pot, the extra braking range of motion in the mad munkey makes the PWM signal go out of bounds causing your vescs to reboot which is pretty concerning...

@lrdesigns @Cobber
Alright guys. Little update. I went to midtown today to ride, about 5 minutes in, low and behold radio was cutting out. Except ALOT worse this time, sometimes it would hold failsafe for 3-7 seconds at a time. Radio lights stayed exactly the same as if nothing was wrong. Blinking light on rx and esc's indicating signal loss. After messing with it for a bit I noticed the range of the remote was extremely bad. Before this I pulled the antenna out of the box and just left it unexposed to make sure it wasn't interfering with anything. Apparently that didn't help at all. No later today when I try diagnosing it, nothing now. No cut outs... so seeing how my radio had solid lights, would that indicate bad receiver possibly? I don't want to have to do this mod again if the radio is fine
Here's a video of what it was doing

That sux. Very short range makes me think it could be a broken antenna. While it might look fine on the outside it might still be broken where it attaches to the pcb. Open the receiver up and check where the antenna is soldered to the pcb. Also check same spot on the transmitter.

Edit: I had my receiver antenna break off at the pcb, I still rode it for a couple days before I figured it out, the range was only a few feet.

I can't speak for others, but my two GT2B (modded into badwolf) are dead solid, never had a single dropout. Guessing you broke something in the process of modding, as I have the exact same ESC on one of my boards and it's done 700km without any issues.

Receiver looks good. Radio looks ok too other than that second little solder blob. The main solder point is good. The one after that looks weak, is that a ground for the outter shielding? I think it might just be for extra strength?
I tried messing with that connection while powered up. No drop outð¤

@overint that's what I thought to but it's such a simple mod. I didn't really think I messed anything up. It did solid for the first 50 miles or so. Then just started having issues. I also noticed disconnecting the throttle pot from rx has no effect on it. Doesn't activate the failsafe. Idk. I'm about to just get a new radio and start from scratch. Pretty annoying issue..

is that a ground for the outter shielding?
[/quote]

Yes it is and is important. The active part of the antenna goes through the middle and the grey colored part is the shield, then at the end should be an un-shielded part (silver wire with clear wrap) which is the actual active antenna part. Should be roughly 30mm long. It didn't get accidentally trimmed? Other than that I am running out of ideas. The active silver part should be same length on TX and RX

On the receiver photo that looks good, the transmitter its hard to see but the ground looks a bit broken.
