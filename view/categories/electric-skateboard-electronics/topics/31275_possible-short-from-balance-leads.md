Hey guys, wondering if it's possible to short a battery from a balancing lead? One of the lead terminal's shrinkwrapped magically shifted and may have contacted the cell next to it. It brought the entire pack down while I was discharging it completely as well sinceI needed to get home fast. It's a 10S3P Space Cell with HG cells. I notice the set of 3 cells were hot as well.

yes of course it is. although they are usually only 22AWG so they vaporize pretty quickly.

Ahh so that IS the root cause of this problem! I just thought it was the solar eclipse that caused it! :scream:
