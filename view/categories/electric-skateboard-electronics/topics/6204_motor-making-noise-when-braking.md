I agreee; it's common if the braking force exceeds the grip of the belt. If you've got a VESC you can modify some settings to reduce braking force and it might mean less skipping.

Belt skipping for 1 million dollars.

Maybe clean everything up good and try to spray a little automotive belt dressing on it. That stuff always seems to make the belts grab better on the pulleys and conditions the rubber from getting brittle as fast. I'm talking from automotive experience, but the math checks out. :wink:
