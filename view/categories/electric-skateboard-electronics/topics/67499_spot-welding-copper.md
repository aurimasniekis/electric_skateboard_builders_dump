Just wanted to know if there is a problem in spot welding coppers. As far as I know it shouldn’t be an issue, but than there is the question, why we not more often use copper instead of nickel strips to build our battery packs.
Copper does not have as much resistance as nickel which would be even better.
What’s your thoughts on it?
If somebody has experience with spot welding copper i‘m Interested if there is something to change in the spot welder settings or if the max thickness which will be able to spot weld would be reduced with copper.
