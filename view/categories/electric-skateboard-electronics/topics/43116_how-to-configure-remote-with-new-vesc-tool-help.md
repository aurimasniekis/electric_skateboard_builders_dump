I got my TB VESC fixed. Now I am using new VESC tool interface. I was able to do a motor detect. I was able to configure battery parameters. Motor moves with arrow keys on keyboard. I connected the receiver to the VESC and bound receiver to radio (green light) but I cannot get the remote to work so I can't set pulse lengths to finish. I am getting hung up on this last step. Can anyone provide some advice? I did a search on forum and did not find what I was looking for.

Make sure you have the Vesc plugged into the correct channel on the receiver for the trigger on your remote

That is the most logical answer. I am sure I am using channel 2 but I will re-check that. Thx

Not all remotes use channel 2 for the trigger. I ran into that issue myself before.

I hope that is it because that is an easy fix. I will keep you posted.

Also check your ppm cable and make sure you don't have a loose signal wire.
It is the white wire.

Hey,
I got my board working and did my first text run yesterday afternoon. I think rebooting the VESC after you pair the remote to receiver was the issue. Runs great for a first build. Thanks so much for all of your assistance. I appreciate it.![FIRST BUILD BOTTOM|690x414](upload://kYAEj7005doe79Y7DzbZSDRg8JE.jpg)![FIRST BUILD TOP|612x500](upload://ruMBgl9f0QAldeiw6556V60J5Eg.jpg)
