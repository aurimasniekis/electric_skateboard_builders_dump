Hi guys
First of all... I love this forum!
My own setup is atm a DIY curved longboard, 200kv alien power systems 6355 motor, 2x3s zippy 8000mah, Xcar beast ESC from HK...

I am planning to order the parts and assembly 5 or 10 VESC soon (next month or the one after ?...)
For me the PCB's cost the same, and my assembly time will not double if I assembly 5 or 10.. maybe some hours more..at the most..
But...
**Would people (mostly europa), be interrested in buying a VESC for about 100USD?** (plus some shipping.. do know people in germany who could ship from there to save cost)
I most properly wont mount wires, but everything else (Do people use the other connectors ?)

hey @B4Me, where are you located in Denmark? I'm from Copenhagen and wouldn't mind to go for a ride. I have this DIY beast:

Main goal of the topic was to determine how many VESC I should assembly :stuck_out_tongue:

But Im from Sønderborg :smiley:

Would you be interested waiting for the upcoming version (6) and assembly then? I was planning to do it myself but might be a bit busy in winter. Also might be interesting to not only order assembled ones, but maybe vesc kits (i.e. groupbuy for mouser parts)

And what are the benefits over this one ?

Several improvements - of which are too much to list here ( check [thread at vedder`s forum](http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=149 ) - but most importantly, the motor driver stage has several improvements that lead to a more robust design (harder to blow up the drv chips). 

There is no specific time frame, other than "coming soon" - though if you read the thread, benjamin has already tested 2 revision of the pcb and is working on the third one (including a casing for it). 

Put it this way: if you need the vesc urgently and right now, you`d be better off building the 4.x version - if you are patient and the project has time to be finished go with v6. I am waiting for v6 and was planing to build it myself. I'd be interested in a group buy (for parts) or even for whole designs ;-).
I can help with ordering PCBs - have some experience with some china vendors (offshore, elecrow and dirtypcb) - I guess it is easy to order 100pieces and also sell the rest for a fair price over here.

Interesting indeed !
The thing is... we are 3 guys, our setups are 2 single motors and 1 with dual .. hence 4 ESC's , and I want to go with dual soon, I am 105kg heavy.. so my motor is HOT at the moment..
therefor 5 VESC's soon... 
Right now the HK ESCs works okay.. but the VESC is so tempting, and if I at the same time could help 5 other persons with new VESC for a cheap price, why wouldnt I  ? :)

But I dont know how long we will wait.. its soon winter in DK, so we can properly wait for version 6 if snow falls

I can relate to that - I have itchy fingers and love to finish my build to still ride this autumn. But it would be a rushed build and in the end I would spend a lot more. Having patience and doing things right will not only save money, but assure some more quality right ;-)

If you are already dealing with motors that run hot (and my guess is also your esc will run hot) - the v6 vesc might be better. As far as I could tell, the new power stage would offer better mounting for heatsinks 

Anyhow - keep me updated :slight_smile:

My setup looks like this.. show off I know...
My ESC is actually really cold, not hot at all, its rated at 120A, with a noisy fan :frowning:
 

I would advice you to slam some stuff together, before the winter comes.. but I get the mentality of waiting for the best, but upgrading is always an option

@SirDiff @monkey32  @OHS

What about the other connections ? do you intent to use CAN connectors, or just solder directly on if dual setup is needed ?

If you ask me, I would ALWAYS solder such connections instead of using alot of plugs, but was do you guys think ?

It would have been awesome.
And I assure you, if I didnt have a busy schedule lately I would have redone the PCB myself, no problem at all, takes a good afternoon maybe..
But It takes time to readup on the different heat-up issues, and create a correct layout for correct heat dissipation :slight_smile:
(lately I created a DC brushed motor controller, controlling 7 motors ranging between 300-50Watts each, full dual H-bridge for each.. It actually dosnt get over 60degress C, that often :P )
But I should maybe be helping people in hear, pushing out new PCB designs ever so often.. but benjamin does a good job all ready :slight_smile:

 Take a read on this blog, his awesome !
I think he have infinite sparetime :P

Who, and what are prices and warranties? From what I've seen, they're either too expensive or mediocre

Faraday is out of stock, scram boards is just reselling chinese ones. Esk8.de is the european Ollinboards, but 170 euros for a single vesc is really too much.

The yellow one with heatsink? It can be found on Alibaba, with the exact same heatshrink, I'm pretty sure about it. Anyway, we're down to 1 possible producer, I think a kinda affordable one with fair prices (130 max?) would have a lot of success.

So the only real producer in Europe is esk8.de, and it costs even more than Chaka's. Let's make Europe great again, build some vescs if you can do so ;)

Yeah, vescs without quality are just junk with good specs. We need something more like Enertion, medium quality but no big issues

but but but i thought you´ll use the upgraded capacitor board. Now you´re only using 2 instead of 3.

every vendor switched from this direct-to-cable soldering to a capacitor board. It´s much more durable and you´ll get much better results with more smaller capacitors! Pls change that! I want to buy stuff from you :D

I know.. but when I ordered my pcb's I didnt see the capacitor pcb design.. and as stated earlier.. time was short.. so I just ordered without it (didnt know there was a design for it at that time :P )
It would also had cost me even more on the pcb prices, sadly :slight_smile:

I decided to order 63V 680uF now ESR caps, so that 2 in parallel would be sufficient for the peak currents..
Correct me if I'm wrong, but these two sould be sufficient, else I maybe can make some arrangement, for a different board (If nothing else, I can hand solder on a 2 layer FR4 raw board :stuck_out_tongue:)

But I can assure you, the caps sits rock solid, but damn it took some time to get them in place, wrap the legs, solder the caps.. now a fun time :P

Hi

I would be interested in 2 if you decide to do a 2nd batch, I'm in the UK.

What will you offer in terms of warranty or support?

Thanks

Khaleel.

I have mixed feeling about this reply to the thread.. guess its okay, but seems wrong if you read how the thread startet out..
You can leave it for now through... as long as everyone is getting some nice VESC's :)
