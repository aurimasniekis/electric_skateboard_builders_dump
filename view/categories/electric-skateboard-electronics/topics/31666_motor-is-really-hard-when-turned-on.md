Hello. I have just been done building my first board. I have a VESC which I have programmed with help from some YouTube videos. 
My only problem is just that when I turn on the board, the motor is really hard to spin, so it's near impossible to get going. When it's off, there's nothing. 
Do anyone know which BLDC setting I have to change to fix the problem?

Sounds like it's trying to brake. Have you calibrated your controller? Do you have a trim on your controller? Is that in the middle?

If it lasts for more than 4 hours, you should call a doctor
