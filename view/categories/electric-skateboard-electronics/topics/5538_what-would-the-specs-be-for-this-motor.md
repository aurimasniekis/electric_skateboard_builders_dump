30-35% grade is fairly steep, especially for your weight. Dual 6355's would the minimum IMO, but you may want to step up to dual 6374's in dual diagonal. Turnigy SK3, Enertion R-spec, or torqueboards (DIYelectricskateboard) would be a good place to start. Try to stick to <200kv.

30-35% is very steep!
You should talk to @torqueboards 
He has experience with steep hills in San Fransisco

You'd have to get the lowest gearing possible ...12t with something larger than a 36t on the wheel...40t 44t? With a low kv motor...but you can't have top speed too...if you move it to 12s ...you would have a better shot

Plus you would def need a dual set up...a single would just eventually die on you putting constant load of 250 with 30% grade
