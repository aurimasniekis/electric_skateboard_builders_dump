So i recently got my vesc...went to install it and basically when i programmed it it all saved and was all perfect but when i gave it throttle the motor doesnt move and just clunks and occasionally gives LOADS of throttle and i cant find what it is....is it the motor wires ? If anyone knows PLEASE tell me !

Thanks guys.

Charged = 25.2v ( MAX )
Mines on = 22.7v

Maybe you should charge them then retry(at that voltage they might not provide enought current to power your motor)...also what are your bldc tool parameter for the vesc cutoff start and cutoff (or just post a screenshoot)

No vesc cutoff, but battery cutoff should stay at 8v (or in that area)

```
the cutoff start and end need to be lowed for detection.
delete the leading 2's.
write config.
motor detection.
test.
put the 2s back.
write.

go ride!

also that is too high for 6s, you'll be on half power.

3.3*6 start
3.5*6 end
is the usual.
