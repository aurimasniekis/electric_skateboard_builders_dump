Hi @Okami,

Bambug is manufactor for electric Mountain board and Skate board in KOREA.
Bambug has a self-developed ESC.
This ESC has very very Powerful power.

One weak point is that you must use Maytech motors together.

Bambug sell "ESC+Remote controller+Maytech motor" in KOREA.  
If you want, i can connect them.
