I think I got the balance connectors wrong because the bms started heating when I connected them. This bms has 13 pins but one of them is b- and my 4x 12s lipos they have 13 pins in so I just put the last pin in b- but it seems like its not working please help.

Sorry man. This is definitely not how you wire up a bms.. I'd say that the best action would be to pull it all apart and start again. There is too much of the wrong thing done here. But you need a soldering iron, and heatshrink to start with. **When you cut those wires please cut one at a time.**  

@Namasaki @evoheyax are the lipo guys that will be able to help with this but I think you will need to give more info like what batteries they are (photos) etc.

Did you make a wiring diagram before?
Do you have a wiring diagram which came with the bms? If yes please upload that here, than it’s more easy to help you.
And yes, please work on your solder skills and use heat shrink instead of hot glue.

The bms didnt come with one, but ill make a wiring diagram on how I wired them so you can tell me whats wrong. And yeah ill fix that I just wanted to test stuff first.

Where did you buy it? Sometimes you can find the diagram on the website of the shop.

That might help you as well

C- in the picture is CH- on your bms
And yes it’s a 10s bms and you probably have other lipos, but in general it’s the same idea.

Also First plug the main leads and thsn the balance plug, just to be on the save side.

Now that I have woken up, it looks like you have cold solder joints on top of the incorrect wiring. 

I'm going to be honest here and I don't mean to sound like a dick but it seems like you don't have the proper understanding or even the patience to go and look up the correct information to build a safe battery. 

The best advice I might be able to give is to let someone else do it for you.

```
if you messed up the balance wires and plugged them in the bms, the bms is most likely dead and you will need to get a new one

No it still works but is it normal that it heats up even though im not charging?

Depends on how much, bms balance the cells by draining them through a resistor
And also if its always hot, then its shorted out probably somewhere
