Hey Guys

I have connected my BMS to my 6 Cell Lipo Battery (6S2P) and to a laptop style charger. I have soldered the negativ of the charger to the CH- port of the BMS and the battery minus and the black balance lead to the B- Port. I connected the other balance leads accordingly.
Even though I did everything according to the instructions it does not charge.
Now I am quiet confused with some terminology.
Can someone explain what the difference between BMS, PCB and PCM is.
I have bought the BMS from this german website:
