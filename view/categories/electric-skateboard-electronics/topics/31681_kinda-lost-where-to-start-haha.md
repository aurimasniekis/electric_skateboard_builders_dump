Spent $375 for my 10s3p battery. It arrived today. I don't want to shell out for another one. Lol. Anybody wanna help a guy get started connecting dual VESC <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/d/9d144958d7c915aa08b9591ff53fbde84db9a961.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/b/2baa92d8be3af138048d8ded613a8f601e3aa783.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/b/1bf6f3a187627f5f789def8a36155d7e6a365289.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/2/8242deac8a1e6000959e58df3d76854a2284ed08.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/a/9ab05885bf3066908e868d7f27387868546dd4f4.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Uh... you have a battery, bms, switch, discharge connector, and a charge port. I'd push that stuff away and focus on the xt90 discharge plug. You can mount all the switches, battery indicators, and charging port into the enclosure later. 

You'll need a xt90 splitter for two vescs. Plug your vescs into those two splitters. Then comes connecting the vescs together via can bus, then adding your rc receiver, then connecting your motors as well as sensor cables to the vesc's 3 phase connectors.

Looks like you're all set. From your last picture it seems you just have to solder 2 male XT90's onto your Vesc power leads and then those should be powered. Connect the motors trough bullets, setup vesc and mount everything where you want it ... 

Unless your still shopping for motors, motor mounts, pulleys and belts. you're there

Where did you buy that? Looks like shit :/ and I'd want others to know to not buy anything there.
Hopefully it does work good though.
