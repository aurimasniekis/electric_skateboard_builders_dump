I recently had a DRV-8302 fail on my VESC 4.12 and I decided to try and replace the IC myself.  I've got years of soldering experience, but I had not used a hot-air rework station until now.  I bought a hot-air rework station and a USB microscope, and gave it a shot.  After a little learning curve I think I have the process reasonably well sorted out. I verified the repair worked, and now I'm up for doing a few more for practice.  So here's the deal...
- You verify with the BLDC Tool that you have a DRV error.
- You ship me your VESC 4.12 with return shipping and $10 for parts.
- I'll replace the DRV IC and return it.

Thanks for the tip.  I'm in Mountain View, CA (USA).  Just added it to my profile.

If there are any SF Bay area folks that would like to give this a go - even better.
