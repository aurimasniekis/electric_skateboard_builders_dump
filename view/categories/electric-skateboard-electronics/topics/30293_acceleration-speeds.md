Hello, I have made a DIY e-skateboard and I wanted to replicate the acceleration speed of the boosted board, if anyone could provide me a curve diagram or something like that it would be great.

Also, it doesn't really need to be a boosted boards acceleration curve, just any good curve would be cool, right now I have it just linear rather than curved.

Cheers,
Vilius.
