I've seen this remote on Ebmaker's site for the last few weeks, but today they released a video about it. I did some reading on their product page and it has some fairly neat features! Seems like a fantastic option for DIYers on paper. I doubt anyone has one at the moment, but I'll be posting a review when I get my hands on it.

**Features**

* OLED screen
* PWM reactive tail light (lights up when you brake, 300mah max)
* Front light (1000 mah max) unsure of what voltage LED's it supports but they claim 50w lights which would mean 50v lights? doesn't make sense to me
![image|480x169](upload://5m1RWxuFj4cdDBeSYSHGPJViHyh.png) 
* Display modes of SPEED, DISTANCE, AMP USAGE, BATTERY, and VOLTAGE. tbh the amp usage view is particularly intriguing.
* 4 interchangeable modes (double tap the button)
* PWM + UART comms
* Hall sensors (vs potentiometer) woo!
* CNC aluminum receiver shell
* whatever this means "Using mature 2.4 Ghz module, have sensitive reaction, strong anti-jamming capability."

**Operational Guide**

> To Switch display contents :   Short press A Button to change the display contents.
> 
> To Switch the gear : Press the A button two times to switch the gear.
> 
> To Turn On/off the front light：Long press the A Button to turn on/off the front light.

They are just a resale company like Maytech as far as I know. The company that I know makes this remote told me there is reliability issues so they do not sell it to American customers. Their VESC’s (except for the super mini AFAIK) are from a different company.

It's on the way! They don't have the molds for the final remote yet so they're shipping me a 3d printed one for testing

I also asked them.  I got this.

> our remote control has not been officially produced yet, and it may take another month.

@Jinra 
I look forward to your review.
