In theory to achieve 60 miles in range with a 12s8p battery, you'd need to get 16/17 wh/m or 25 wh/km, are these numbers realistic at all for dual 6374s, with 107mm?

All depends what cells you use.

Also, 25 wh/km is VERY high. You should be getting around 10wh/km with non-pnuematic wheels.

You should need around 1000wh to go 60 mi. (Someone correct me if I'm wrong, I just remember reading 10wh/km)

Forgot to add that. It'd be Samsung 30Q. If 25 wh/km is high for non-pnuematic wheels then I am under the impression it is achievable. Haven't been able to find a reliable wh/km number I could use in the calculation, thanks.

It all depends on your riding style, my friends get around 25-30miles with a 10s5p while I only get around 15

It really depends on your style. 

I got 21.5 wh/km on my last 16km ride with a 12s6p 30q on 97mm abec 11 with 6374 190kv unsealed maytech and 15/36 gearing.

I ride fast and offensive when possible. I always slow down for dogs and pedestrians of course or anything or anyone that looks like they might act or react irrationally.

This route though really allows me to go all out most of the time. Itâ€™s awesome. Also pretty unrealistic for most other routes to ride this way.
