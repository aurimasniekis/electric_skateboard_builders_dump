So I have a 10s5p powering a 6380 motor and tonight may have ruined the battery.. I took off on a flat for about 500 feet and then started down 1000 ft hill using my brakes the whole way when I got to the bottom my board shut off and won't turn back on, I tried plugging it into the charger and turning it on still nothing. Voltage at the plug is 39 volts but voltage at the balance Leeds is 43 I have an 11 pin balance plug on the BMS so I tested from the first to last. first being ground last being cell number 10 giving me 43v  now when I test them individually the first cell shows 4v and then the second shows 9v that's 1 too high how do I fix this?
