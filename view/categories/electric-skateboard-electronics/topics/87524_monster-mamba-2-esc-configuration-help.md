I wanted to know how I should configure my ESC for esk8 use (I have this ESC on hand and wanted to use it in my first build, I'll definitely get a VESC down the line but for now this is what I plan to use)

I was looking through the [castle link application](http://home.castlecreations.com/download-castle-link) and it can configure the [mamba monster 2](http://www.castlecreations.com/en/mamba-monster-2-2/mamba-monster-2-esc-010-0108-00) quite a bit. But I haven't used a esk8 so I'm not sure how to configure the ESC for that use.

I'll be using the [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-213KV](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-213kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) motor with two 3s 8000 mah 40c batteries (6s) and [Traxxas Rx/TX](https://traxxas.com/products/parts/6530)

Here are the "**Basic**" Options:

![01-Basic|290x500](upload://nGngYGoF7hufnr4occG8HNCoTB5.jpeg) 

I'd like to know what the suggested "Brake Amount" would be here I'm pretty sure that 50% is way too high.

Here are the "**drag brake**" (coasting?) options

I'd guess that this should be pretty low if not 0% not sure though. Can imagine alot of broken bones if this where too high. Or I could be wrong maybe it should be at 213% :stuck_out_tongue:

Here are the "**Power**" options:

I doubt I'll have reverse on the board can't see many uses for that, again I might be wrong there.

Here are the "**Punch control**" options:

This is something I've messed around with on RC car's but I think it would be wiser to have this disabled.

Here are the "**Advanced**" options:

![05-advanced|289x500](upload://8IZkBNItIgYHucbG7zTx2YkJens.jpeg) 

No idea if I should leave this on default or do any changes here.

Here are the "**motor timing**" options:

![06-sensorless-motor-timing|350x500](upload://qyvdXEJjVute9AqCmZf1WCgNQeK.jpeg) 

Not sure if that needs any changing

Here are the "**Arming time**" options:

![07-arming-time|306x500](upload://psVVP0ZxEK0rd5DNkfEIz1Be1JV.jpeg) 

Not sure if that needs any changing

---

Last but not least "**Throttle and Brake curve**" options:

![08-Throttle-curve|290x500](upload://u4QB4qDBwsslaxKfMXyHIU4SyI3.jpeg) 

![09-brake-curve|291x500](upload://xQkRCfy3OPBSJF8MIceqwjjBOJ4.jpeg) 

I guess these two are more subjective rather than "right or wrong"

If there is a post going over this then I beg your pardon :slight_smile: I did try and search for it but didn't find anything specific about the monster mamba 2 configuration.
