No real options unless you go DIY or diyeboards

Yeah alot of people say it is bad because it does not use good battiers

I always wondered if you wire 2 in parallel it wouldn't be a bad battery but damn 10s10p for 720wh is kinda sad but really not bad for less than $400

You can have cheap or good, and you've chosen cheap

That's only cheap if you are successful, when doing DIY there is always extra hidden cost somewhere and there is a chance you can mess up cells or a bms while making it costing you more money and time. 

Dont get my wrong I encourage  DIY it's fun and satisfying but it's not the best option for everyone.

there are a shit ton of diagrams and everything
the hardest part is the bms, and that is simple if you actually think about it
check the wires 5 times and your golden :D

Arduino one  and a 5ah 100+c battery 
this comes out at around 160$ if you add the cost of cells it comes out more expensive than just getting a battery from a guy on here  so unless you are planning more batteries for whatever you need its not worth it IMO unless you want to learn how and make it yourself

I really like the DIY route, I went so far that last weekend I installed floor heating piping for a 100m2 brothers house, like 900meters of tubing :D

It might be cheaper and better to buy the cells and ask @longhairedboy or @scepterr to weld them for a nominal fee, then do the rest of the battery manufacture yourself after the nickel is welded.

Thank you for that I will think about it the only problem is how big it is but for the price it looks good.

Yes you have.

How can you make a recommendation on something you have not done?

A shitty welder is hundred times more dangerous.

This would be my recommendation for a small pack. Maybe even double up for a 10S4P.

I believe they are 30Q cells and it has a BMS. The only issue is that it's a double stack and O don't like double stacks.

I have 2 10s5p from them one using hub one one belts (from they too), I don't experience voltage sag until battery goes to ~36 - I would not recommend for anything 'custom' but if your going for china hubs or belt kit stuff  I think its good value for money

He means time, broken connections that have to be redone, weak welds that break over time and make your board catch on fire, there are plenty of things that can and usually do go wrong when building batteries diy. You also have peace of mind, etc.
