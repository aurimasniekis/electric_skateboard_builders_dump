Would this be possible to this mount on a mini remote? Seems a perfect place to put a bike bell.

Everything is possible...,
Whatâ€™s your question with it. This bell doesnâ€™t need any electronics from the remote so why it shouldnâ€™t work ðŸ˜…

But just think about the place you will mount.
Itâ€™s a trigger remote. The position on the wheel is not comfortable

Edit: if you left handed than itâ€™s a other story ðŸ˜…

I believe @Linny did it. Check his first build log.

I did that for my mini remote but i don't use it anymore, but for those who do and doesn't use the wheel, i cut it off, sanded it flat, polish it up (if you want to), and superglued a bicycle bell which is also flattened, onto the round spot. I'll take a pic of it with the remote when i'm home.

I would rather add a button to my remote and a 12V (or whatever it is ) car horn to my board
