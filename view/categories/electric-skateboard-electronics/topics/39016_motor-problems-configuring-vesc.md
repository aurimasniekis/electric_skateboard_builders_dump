Hello, I need help with configuring my VESC. Whenever I press "start detection" in the BLDC tab, my motor (diyelectric 5065/260kv) starts twitching and does not spin correctly. I also get errors in the BLDC tools. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your time!

I have VESC problems too.

Here is my thread that I started today.
[http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/i-need-some-help-with-my-vesc-please/39006/4](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/i-need-some-help-with-my-vesc-please/39006/4)

Something that helped my initial problem (I still have others), based on reading posts here, was that I didn't have a higher enough voltage. I was using a 4S and I doubled it 8S. That allowed my motor to run smoothly for the detection test, but I still can't detect it.
