Like title says anybody knows the spec of the bms such as max Current specs? The link for it is here products/12s4p-electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-panasonic-pf

Talked to helpdesk guy from the site specs he gave, 12S4P - 44.4v - 11600mah - 515.04wh - ( 25 miles ). He didn't know bms just said they come shipped with it. Wonder if it's same bms 30amp cont, 80amp max peak, that they ship with the Samsung 30q?
