I'm currently setting up the electrics on a build and I have the Smart BMS. There is a bluetooth dongle attached to this so that I can run the app on my Android phone. 
With the phone, I can see the bluetooth connection, but when I try to connect it keeps on coming up with the same error message "Unable to communicate with xiaoxiang BMS"
Anyone else encounter this issue??

Maybe you got the wrong app.
There are like 3 different apps and other versions and only 1 worked for me,
Delete your app and try to instal this one:

And otherwise send the seller a message, he will send you the correct version.

Thanks for the info.
Not sure whether it is an issue with my phone (Samsung G4) or just a 'flaky' bluetooth connection, but after numerous attempts, I have been able to get it to work. Just gotta hope that it continues to work for me now......

Yeah sometimes it doesn't work from try 1.
Mostly the first or second try in my case.
Just start the app, then it searched automatically -> press on the bms. 
If you get unable to connect -> just tap refresh and press on bms again then it must connect.

When I didn't use the bluetooth app for like a day, I have to do it twice, it's like you have to wake up the bluetooth module.

Thanks. Your description is pretty well what I went through today, but it took a little longer to want to wake up.
I'll keep trying over the next few days and hopefully, it will be a little more cooperative.
