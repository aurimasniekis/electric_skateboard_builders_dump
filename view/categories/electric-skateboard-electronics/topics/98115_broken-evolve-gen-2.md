So i was recently riding my Evolve Gen 2 AT when the brakes suddenly applied full force, after checking the board i discovered the wheel spins about a cm and then stops and is as firm as a brake to try to spin, it also generates this buzzing noise from the esc. The board recently underwent a battery and Bms replacement however the board had been working fine for weeks. I cannot identify whether this is the ESC or motor and being a gen 2, if either has to be replaced i do not know where to source them.

Would really appreciate some help in pinpointing the problem and fixing it.
