I am in the middle of making my own board using the parts below, but i am curious how much and idler effects range? @AdamE3399  has a dual 6364 build without idlers and he gets around 16km on a 5ah bat so should i expecting to get around 13km or so?
   here are other questions as well
* how do you calculate range with and idler?
* What belt life can i expect?
* does 15mm belts effect range more than 12mm?
* should i use better bearings than the one supplied from @Boardnamics to decrease drag/resistance?  

Parts used:
>*Boardnamics motor mount with idler
*Dual flipsky 4.12 v3.4 vescs
*dual Tb 6355 190kv  motors
*Tb 218 trucks
*Tb pulley
*Micro drop down sector 9 deck with carbon and fiberglass layers
*100mm Mbs wheels, green,  running bone red bearings
*Chines Bms and charger
*4 x Turnigy 5000mah 3s batteries 
*nano remote/unbranded

an idler doesn't necesarily make a difference. tightening your belt DOES make some difference but if you don't tighten it too much you shouldn't encounter a difference in range

your belt width doesnt affect range. at least not noticeably.

belt life stays about the same

getting a better bearing for the idler doesnt make a difference

TL;DR just get an idler to fight belt slip. it doesnt affect anything else

so would you recommend just getting 15mm belts than 12?

You can run 9mm belts on dual....Ive seen it done but I wouldn’t do it myself. I’m a bigger guy and building a 12s battery pack so I’m going to put thicker belts in there.

I’m using 15mm but most use 12 and call it a day. Main cause of belt breakage I’ve seen is due to debris getting caught in it, not because it was too thin.

Yea. i know were i can get 10mm belts but i don't know if i should get them

120kg+ and 12mm belts might slip on braking.

i weight like 73kg so i should be fine

although i am a bit greedy for speed so if i went full throttle instantly would that just shred the belts on 12mm?

depends on your belts and if you tighten them with the right strength

i have idlers that make the belts tight, to rock solid if i want

rock solid
[/quote]

that's not always what you want.
think you didn´t got the idea of an idler.
its not to tighten the belt as max as possible.
it´s to run the belts as lose as possible.

get 15 mm belts, run them a little looser and with idler

the point of idlers is to maximise tooth engagement while allowing the belt to be run as loose as you can get it without slipping.  This will stop the belts skipping on accel and braking but reduce the rolling resistance significantly and make the drivetrain more efficient.

So to conclude:

* Avoids belt skiping (tighten belt)
* Improves motor efficiency (more engaging pulley teeth)
* Longer belt life (reduces belt breaking)

i'm 100 kilo plus and i rode 9mm belts on a dual set up and rocking it, anyway i will recommend 12 mm instead 9 or 15mm

I don't have any data on range.  BUT, idlers did reduce my top end speed by ~3-4 mph.

Note: my mounts had dual idlers (both sides of the belt).

running the belt too tight. Should if anything free things up a bit.  Much better free rolling.

Even though idlers make debris harder to get into the pulley, just a thought, wouldn't it also technically be harder to remove from the pulley without remove the wheel and belt?

Depends what it is thats in there lol.  Most rocks and such come out after you've scraped your face back up off the concrete

That's what I thought too!  I had my belts fairly loose and even had brand new bearings on the idlers.  

Still experienced the same result.  It felt like the idlers introduced extra drag / friction to the drive system.

I got that with a dual but single works a treat.  It does depend a lot on the position of said idler though.  Sounds to me like yours are a bit close to the motor pulley.  Its a battle though because of the wheel sizes we use now.  I put my own idlers on mostly so can put them in the best place for whatever wheel and mounts I'm using.  Much easier to set up on a long reverse mount though

I never got around to trying a single idler, just double.  And you are right, the idlers were both pretty close to the motor.

I'm not super experienced with idlers, so I figured I must have been doing something wrong.  It was enough of a PIA that afterwards I decided to just stick with shorter motor mount setups that don't require idlers.

Ive ran a couple different motor mounts with single and double idlers and found them to be a detriment to the free-rolling factor. It wasnt as noticeable on urethane wheels but was obvious AF with my sixshooters 60t pulleys. Instead of idlers, just make sure pulley alignment is near perfect using a QUALITY mount and have proper belt tension for the best riding experience. Ive changed my builds up so many times lol and also dont use keyway or grub screws on motor pulley, instead use loctite 638 and save yourself (or someone riding your board) the grief of motor pulley coming loose
