Hi there, I'm trying to download the BLDC tool on 
http://vesc.net.au/download-for-windows-2/
Was watching this vid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovCd2ksQb6w
But whenever I click download,nothing happens (on internet explorer, I got a popup, subscribed to the mailing list, but nothing really happened after that) I feel like i'm missing something stupidly simple here
any help would be appreciated

thanks
```

It should start after you hit enter from typing your email, but I noticed sometimes it doesnt as well. Try in incognito and Chrome if you have it.

I found it very annoying too. I would prefer a ribbon on the top right of the page (github style) and a link + some text near the download buttons instead of all of this. I guess that better ux will increase donations too at the end.... Luckily you can navigate through the FTP to get the latest version.

FTP root directory:
