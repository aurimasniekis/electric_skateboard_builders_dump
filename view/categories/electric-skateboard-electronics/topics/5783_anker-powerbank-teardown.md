Anyone know of a powerbank (for laptops/cellphone charging) like this one https://www.amazon.com/Anker-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-PowerCore/dp/B00X5RV14Y/ref=gbph_img_m-3_8142_a117b005?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0&smid=A294P4X9EWVXLJ&pf_rd_p=2530018142&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-3&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_i=11448061011&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=WC83JJH9VV651MSAMZNS



..that has the high-discharge cells in it that one could teardown and repurpose? Its on hella discount for (US) Prime Day

**These are using 6 18650 Panasonic 3400mAh batteries - NCR18650B. I was looking for the same answer and someone took one apart. Here is the video - https://youtu.be/25Ic0lymU58 **

I'd be surprised if you found an external pack similar to this one that had cells with a high enough discharge rate. These packs only need cells with a small(ish) discharge rate like these Panasonic NCR18650B cells, which only have a 6.8A discharge rate. The cells we use in e-boards really need to have 15-20A minimum discharge rates. If you were to use these cells (the Panasonic NCR18650B), you'd probably need 10-11 cells in parallel, at minimum, to get a decent discharge rate.

I've used this brand for charging my phone....

Good for phones ... Don't think it would be good for our purpose....

The smaller ones I've had do get warm when charging your phone...tells me any high draw in the batteries will heat them up quick
