Hello everyone! This is my first post on eSk8 though ive been reading stuff on here for a while now. A couple months ago I wanted a new switch for my board other than my crap-a-tronic fuse switch that was falling apart. So I looked some up and saw a couple very similar devices online from Alien Drive, DIY Boards and a couple other sellers. They were all around $60 and I didn't want to spend that much so I decided to build my own. I looked around a bit online and asked some questions on some forums and got some answers eventually. Currently the switch is built around a IRLB3034 N-Channel MOSFET which is an amazing fet because of its extremely low RDS of only 1.7m Ohm, which in turn makes it extremely efficient and cool running. I tested the switch on  my board which draws around 8-10 Amps cruising normally and ~15 Amps going pretty fast. At any of these speeds the mosfet didnt even get warm, and I was testing this on a 90f degree day. The 3034 fet is great and super cheap, but the problem is it has a max voltage of 40V which will only work with 8S lipos at the most, though dont fret because I found a higher voltage mosfet! The IRFB7530 is another great fet with a rds of only 1.65mOhms and has a max voltage of 60V which means it can work with upto 12S LiPos. Anyways enough with the specs, I am going to upload the schematic for anyone who wants to build there own, but for people who dont want to build one themselves, I would be happy to make and sell them. The circuit would have its own custom PCB and ports for the switch to turn the fet on and off as well as XT60 connectors for power. If anyone is interested in buying one or getting some more info on it im more than happy to help! The couple of pics of the actual circuit was the very first version I made and if I were to do it again it would look far better.

Yeah ill definitely do that. Personally I just bought the mosfet on EBay, though I had to order like 5 of them, though it was still only like under $10. Then there's the diode which ill link, you can get those on eBay in small bulk packs for like $1-2 and there great to have for any electronics enthusiast. And then just some 10K resistors and perf board to assemble it on, though I would highly recommend just making your own PCB, its actually quite simple and looks beatiful!

Also I found this [MOSFET](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/196/irfp7718pbf-936343.pdf), its the IRFP7718PBF and its capable of handling 75V or a 17S LiPo Pack! So if anyone was planning on making a 17S pack, then yeah I guess you could do that, though good luck finding an ESC capable of running 75V.

**OUTDATED SCHEMATIC NEW VERSIONS BELOW**

Here is a schematic I designed for the switch, in the example it uses an IRFB7530 mosfet, and is designed for 12S, though you can change that out for a different kind of mosfet. The circuit image and and .Zip download are below. Note that the LED resistor must be at least a 1/2W resistor but I would recommend a 1W so it doesn't get to hot. **IMPORTANT!** The thick traces for the + and - rails are not thick enough to handle high amperage, you have to add a layer of solder on the top or a wire that runs along it to handle the higher amperage.

Hey ndwallick the diode is an essential part of the circuit. The diode lets buildup current flow from the - to the + lead which is the opposite of the way current normally flows, this is because of an electron buildup that can occur and destroy a circuit if a diode is not there to let the electrons flow back. Anyways, its a very important part of the circuit and if you were asking to see whether or not you need the diode, the answer is a definite yes, lol. Though thank you for asking the question so now others will know!

Hello Maxid, at the time of me needing a new switch for my EBoard, I had no idea the Vedder switch even existed, if I had I would have most likely used that design. When I created this thread I still had no idea the Vedder switch existed and it was only until someone told me about the Vedder switch because of how similar my switch is and the Vedder one were that I found about it. I still think that it cant hurt having more than one design for a MOSFET switch out there and this is my version of it, I know this one is very similar but still I don't think it can do anybody any harm having this one out there.

Your through-hole components have the traces on the top of the board. I believe that you need to either flip the components, or flip the traces (make them blue).

That's a good point but if you noticed how I'm using the heatsink flange for the mosfets drain, I have to have the components on the top side with the traces on the top side as well. Though you could definitely have just the mosfet on the top side and the other things like resistors and the diode on the bottom side.

Yes, but literally all of your other components need to be on the other side of the board then, especially your LED and pin header, which you won't be able to solder on (unless your via is already made there).

That's true but even if you did that it would still work, it wouldn't be the prettiest thing but it would work. Also you could mount all the components on the opposite side and just bolt the FET through the PCB onto the large contact for the drain. In fact that might actually work pretty well and I may do that my self.

That's so cool that you actually built the design! Thank you it means a lot! That's great to hear that its working well, did you use the same IRFB7530 MOSFET or did you use another type? Also I would recommend that you maybe shrink wrap the entire thing or wrap it in electrical tape, if you haven't already done that lol.

Yeah the 3034 is what I'm using in my board and it seems to work very well. Did you buy the 3034 on EBay from some cheap seller or did you buy them from a trusted retailer like Mouser? I'm just wondering because you might wanna be careful running them near there limit if there cheaper non legit versions. I'm using some cheap ones off of eBay though they work fine for me and don't get warm whatsoever at 6S ~15A cointinous.

Can anyone with more electronics knowledge answer this question?

Suppose this switch is off and I am kicking my board. I'm assuming the Vesc will be on because it is being powered from the motor spinning. If I send a brake command to the vesc will the batteries charge? (because mosfets do not block current going backwards)

```
Well first off I heard some people talking about almost exactly this in another thread, I'm not sure where but ill try to find out. Though eventually they decided that pushing the board along with it being off was a very bad idea, and they are very right. If the switch is off then it won't allow current to flow either direction which means you'll have an electron buildup which could, and will, lead to either killing a your VESC MOSFET or other components connected to the circuit. And I don't even think peddling would supply enough current to keep the VESC on. But if it did and it tried letting current flow to the batteries, obviously the MOSFET switch but be in between and would then either kill the fet or the VESC. @ndwallick

Hey Astro! The ones you linked on EBay I'm sure will work, but they won't be as good or as trustworthy as legitimate versions from a trusted retailer like the other MOSFET you linked. Also you can get the exact same IRFB7530PBF on Mouser for only $3.33 so there a couple $$$ cheaper. And Mouser is definitely a legitimate vendor.

VladPomogaev was saying that I should also have the MOSFET on the opposite side of the board like most PCB's are and have a bolt go through the board and that was definitely the right idea. Anyways I redesigned a small part of the schematic to accommodate the MOSFET being mirrored on the opposite side of the copper traces. So if you plan on doing that please use this design instead.

I finally finished making the circuit and it turned out ok! I tested it at 15V and it works fine though I'm going to be testing it at 24V soon. I'm aware that my soldering skills are complete crap, but hey it works lol. For the XT60 leads I used some awesome high strand super flexible 12 AWG wire and the mosfet is the IRFB7530PbF for a 12S build. I still have to shrink wrap the entire thing to give it some protection but I will do that when it arrives.

P.S. I got my 12AWG Wire off of Amazon, but I found some on Aliexpress for $4 a meter, which is pretty good in my opion if you don't mind waiting a month.

Actually I've changed my mind completely lol. Yes I think there would be reason to put 2 or more fets in parallel for a higher current application, in fact im working on designing a PCB that is very similar to the original design, except it accommodates two TO-220 MOSFET's instead of one for an upto ~60A system. I also may work on a schematic using the IRFS7530-7P which is pretty much the same fet that the VESC uses, because of its lower RDSON and lower C/W rating.

I mentioned in the post above about creating a board that would have two MOSFET's in parallel, well I finished designing it and its obviously extremely similar to the original single fet design though it will work if you ever need to pull somewhere around 40-60A continuous. I also still plan on making a design around the IRFS7530-7P when I have time to do so.

Here is the IRFS7530-7P I was talking about. Obviously very similar to the other ones but it accommodates a D2PAK 7-P package MOSFET. Its not done yet I think theres some things I would change but yeah. And this would obviously have a strange mismatch of SMD and normal components, which would mean the fet would be on one side and everything else on the other. Also it took me a while to find a D2PAK lbr file for Eagle but [HERE](https://github.com/triffid/BLDC/blob/master/D2PAK-7.lbr) is the link to the Github file if your interested.

Lol, so the max rating on a MOSFET is usually COMPLETE AND UDDER BULLSHIT. By that i mean like the TO-220 package leads will melt at around 75A so that's out the window right there. And doing the math at 30A your going to see around a 94C degree temp rise on the 7530 which is fine but much higher and its gonna start to get sketchy. I heard that they literally COOL the IC's in non conductive boiling liquid to test the max amperage, so yeah unless your planning on doing that, then don't even worry about the supposed "max amperage" for the MOSFET, do the heat calc your self and figure out a safe operating amperage, or Google it and you'll figure out the true max safe amperage.

I am just curious because the "[Vedder Anti Spark Switch](https://github.com/vedderb/SparkSwitch)" is kinda standard but no one said that it is maxed to 60A... So the Vedder Switch cannot handle more than 60A? Somehow i doubt it but i am glad if somebody can enlighten me ;)

Well this [Vedder Switch](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/anti-spark-switch-kit-extras-for-sale-vedders-v1-3/384) which is another great one and I highly recommend you take a look at, uses a 40A fuse on the positive rail which pretty much means, a 40A limit for the switch. I think it could possibly handle ~45A without a heat sink but I wouldn't risk. And like I said just do the heat calculations because that is your main problem, heat generation and dissipation.

Well yeah 50A would be definitely near its limit and it would be getting damn hot though I think it would work (haven't done the equation, I'm tired.)  anyways most EBoards don't draw 50A continous so its not a big deal and if you did need to draw 50A cont, you'd be better off using 2 fet's in parallel like my dual fet schematics. Also heatsinking does help a lot though its still not fixing your under lying problem of drawing to much current from your fet.

I am still confused somehow....

The battery provides 44,4V  (12S) with a rather low amperage. Thus it will not melt the 40A fuse.
Now i remembered that @hummie and @devin have measured some data:

[quote="devin, post:56, topic:6753"]
46.92V average
44.1 amps peak
4.92 amps average
[/quote]

This is the part where i get confused. The wattmeter is between the battery and the ESC so the amps peak should have blown a AntiSparkSwitch!?

It would be alright to setup the VESC battery max = <40A and the motor to 80A?
It would be the same acceleration/torque if battery max is at 40A instead of 80A?

Thanks in advance for enlighten me!

Personally I don't have a VESC, wish I did though, so I can't tell you exactly how the VESC would behave but, escalating the max amperage can give you more torque because like I said when the motors first start up they draw a lot of current and the VESC may limit that because you set it to 40A max so it would be better to set it higher in that case. Though like I said I don't know to much about the VESC so I'm not the right person to ask sorry. And the reason the fuse doesn't blow is because its drawing that current for a very short amount of time so the fuse doesn't have enough time to heat up and break.

I was reading more about paralleling MOSFETS  and you can't use one resistor for the same gates of the MOSFET's because they will "fight" over the voltage for the gate capacitance so I have to go and change that on the dual fet circuit's.

## **!!!VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE!!!**

The gate resistors for the MOSFET('s) can not always be just 10K resistors! I was originally doing this and its wrong! The 2 resistors act as a voltage divider for the gate but you have to make sure the voltage is not over the Vgs max of the MOSFET. For a 12S build you will need a 24-32K Ohm resistor on the positive side and a 10K on the negative side of the voltage divider. For a 10S build 18-25K Ohm on positive side and 10K on negative. For an 8S build 2x 10K's would be fine but a 12K on the positive side would be better. 6S Build two 10K's are fine as well. You can also use a mismatch of different resistor values using a [Voltage Divider Calculator](http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/voltage-divider-calculator) to calculate the required values, just don't use any resistors under ~1K Ohms. I put an example below so you can get a better understanding.

USING A 12V ZENER DIODE TO DRIVE THE GATE WOULD BE BEST! Using a 12V Zener would mean the gate always gets 12V no matter what the voltage is, as long as it's above 12V obviously.

Hey @sl33py my switch uses the IRFB753PPbF MOSFET which has a max voltage of 60V so you could technically use a 14S battery. Also most components that have a max of 12S can probably handle 13S-14S just because not many parts have a max voltage of above 50.4V(12S full charge) and below 60V so usually there max is 60V, not much in between.

Well its up to you on which one you want. Either one will work for your single drive setup though the dual MOSFET one that's $35 instead of $25 will future proof you more because you'll be able to use it with a dual drive setup if you ever decide to go that route. If you want the LED Pushbutton its an additional $10 so for the single FET switch it will be $35 and the dual would be $45 though like I said my prices are negotiable.

[quote="JdogAwesome, post:14, topic:5738, full:true"]
Hey ndwallick the diode is an essential part of the circuit. The diode lets buildup current flow from the - to the + lead which is the opposite of the way current normally flows, this is because of an electron buildup that can occur and destroy a circuit if a diode is not there to let the electrons flow back. Anyways, its a very important part of the circuit and if you were asking to see whether or not you need the diode, the answer is a definite yes, lol. Though thank you for asking the question so now others will know!

A single 7530 MOSFET is not going to be enough for 60A continuous 

In addition, most anti-spark switches have a capacitor and resistor in series, connecting the gate to the drain. It's my understanding that this is what limits the inrush of current to the ESC's caps, preventing the spark

You want to keep the power dissipation to around 1 W per FET.  With a single 7530, you would be dissipating 4-5 W at 60A.  A single 7530 should really only be used up to 30A continuous, and even that is pushing it a bit.  Otherwise you need to incorporate passive or active cooling

@jmasta @dstnceswmer A single FET is fine for your use. Your board only draws around 20A nominal with peaks UpTo around 80A but that's for a very short amount of time and it can handle it fine. @jmasta about the capacitor resistor on the gate to limit inrush current thing, no you should not do that. I was talking to some very smart electricians on Stack Exchange and they were saying it isn't healthy for FET's. Also inrush current doesn't matter because it's a MOSFET so there is no sparking and they can handle extremely brief high inrush current no problem.  Also I've been using a single 7530 FET as a switch for my board for a while and it works, so yeah.

my switch in the drawing should only be on when the board is turned on (when motor/VESC is connected to the battery). When the board is switched off the battery monitor will also be off. This is because the negative lead of the monitor is connected to the drain of the fet, same as the motor. So when the FET is off there is no connection of the negative  wire in either the motor or batt monitor to the ground of the battery.

dang wish I saw this earlier lol. I actually just ordered 5 from digi key today for like $20 :(. I did go with a slightly cheaper one than the 7530'standard though.  I went with IRFB7534PBF. The specs seen nearly the same as the 7530's. Also I'm gonna be putting two in parallel just to err on the side of caution

I set up a push switch before my battery indicator, and I'd just press the button whenever I want to check the charge. I'd imagine it'd be doable if you have a 3 pin dc connector (tip, sleeve, shunt) and a transistor to check when the dc jack is plugged in.

pin 3 disconnects when a jack is plugged into the connector.

My knowledge of electronics is only ankle deep so I cant really think up a schematic for it :disappointed_relieved:.

@wuwica , @dstnceswmer, thanks for the input but It is not that easy, I've already looked into this, and dont know how to do it, that's why i asked in the first place.

@wuwica    this kind of dc jack is mostly used for radio that use both plug in dc power and battery but not at the same time.  reason this dc jack can not be used for my purpose  :  when plug in, tip2 would bend out a bit just enough for tip3 lost contact at that black arrow(ur pic above). but we need contact to get the voltage, so this is not gonna work. Unless we use something similar to e-switch, i think.

btw, my knowledge of electronics is very short too. Maybe i missed something.

Yea that picture is labeled right, and I meant to use the transistor gate to take in a connection from the tip shunt.

When a dc jack is plugged into the connector the tip shunt will disconnect and will allow the drain/source to be connected.  I was only assuming this would work so I just brought up the possibility.  I'd use the transistor as a switch.

Exactly, just makes sure the gate drains when you power down the circuit. And the reason its such a high value is so it doesn't affect the gate voltage as a voltage divider.

@JdogAwesome If your switch is 12V rated how is it ok to be using in your configurations? the way I see it (even at 10s) the potential across the switch is (Vbatt-12V) = (42-12)=30V > 12V
```

## \#114 Posted by: JdogAwesome Posted at: 2016-11-29T19:51:28.535Z Reads: 199

The switch is rated at 12V because the LED has the proper current limiting resistor for 12V that's the point of the two 4.7K resistors is to add to that current limiting resistor. Just because a switch says it can handle 12V doesn't mean it can't handle higher voltages, to an extent.

So I've been running a few simulations in LTspice and from what I can tell, the led in my rocker switch is going to be screwing with my gate voltage on my FETs. Best I can guess is that inside the switch is an led in series with a 500ohm resistor (that would make it 12V tolerant) the cathode end of this is tied to the switch ground while the anode is connected to the center tap. Problem is that this small 500 ohms negates the affects of my zener and acts as a voltage divider with my current limiting 10k, effectively giving me a smaller than desired gate voltage. Below is the schematic I have been simulating. Any thoughts?

Your definetly right that the LED would affect the gate voltage. Though you shouldn't be running anything off the gate anyway. The way I have it setup is so the LED terminals have there own channel with the two 4.7K resistors. Though with your rocker switch your saying there connected to the terminals right? The switch I use has separate terminals for the LED light, and terminals for the contacts.

Yup that's exactly what I was saying. It's just an automotive rocker w/led. I can see how having the led on a separate terminal would work. looks like my options are:
1. See if I can crack open the switch and re-route the led anode
2. Buy a new switch with broken out separate terminals
3. Use some sort of 12V step-down regulator as gate/LED power supply instead of zener diode (prob. over complicating things)

1. so actually quite easily popped off the top of the switch and was able to seperate the led annode from the switch center tap. just as I suspected, was just a 500ohm res/led in series. So that's a viable option.

Hey @dstnceswmer to elaborate, from what I understand it's more of a issue with the gate capacitance and how you want the MOSFET's to turn on at around the same and they have trouble doing that drawing from a small supply, like a resistor. In this use case scenario I think you would be fine just using a single resistor zener combo, but having two separate gate drivers like that also gives you a failsafe in case one zener dies or something, would hate for your board to die whilst going down a hill. In any case you'd be fine just using a single zener. Hopefully that helps you out, if you have any other questions just let me know!

Ah ok yeah that makes sense, I'll prob go with two diodes for redundancy's sake as you suggested. I have been running my switch made up on perf board with just one gate voltage supply for a little while now, but am in the process of drawing up my schematic for a new pcb in kicad now. One other thing that I'm not totally clear on was your choice of using a 6.8k resistor for the LED in your lighted switch. I am getting one of those lighted PC latching switches as well and from what I can tell:

From switch specs: LED +12v, 15mA

My calculations show:
R = (+12v - Vd) / 0.015A
R+R' = (50.4V - Vd)/0.015A
(+12v - Vd) / 0.015A + R' = (50.4V - Vd)/0.015A
R' = [(50.4V - Vd)/0.015A] - [(+12v - Vd) / 0.015A]
R' = (50.4v -12v -Vd +Vd) / 0.015A
R' = 2560 ohms for 15mA @50.4V
R' = 2.2k should give about 17mA

So why so high with the 6.8k resistor on there?

here is a link to the switch I bought:

[/quote]

That's to funny I'm still running one of my very first single FET 3034 designs and it's been working great for me, lol. So pretty much the LED is rated at 12V at 15ma, MAX. Which means running it any higher than that will kill it eventually. Even if you ran the LED at like 2 ma it would still light up just not as bright. The problem with running it at 15ma from a 50V supply is that the resistor would need to dissipate around 800mW of power which means you would need a relatively beefy resistor and it would also just generate a lot of unnecessary heat. To be honest if your using a 10-12S setup I'd just use a 10K resistor, but because people using my switch designs use all different voltages I wanted to make sure it would still be relatively bright at the lower spectrums like 6S, so I chose 6.8K.

Also the switch you bought looks nice I use a very similar one. Pretty much you just want to use the C (common) and NO (Normally Open) contacts as normal switch contacts and then the + and - for powering the LED inside the switch. Just make sure to connect the - of the LED to the drain of the FET so it only turns on when the switch is on. Also in case you wanted to calculate how much heat your MOSFET will produce under load use this calculation. I simplified it and just labeled every value pretty much so just replace parts in it with your FET's values. 

Heat generation: 
20¬≤ * 0.009 = 3.6W at 20A

0.009 - Miliohm RDSON found on datasheet
20¬≤ - amperage squared
3.6W - heat generated in watts

Above Ambient Calc
0.68 * 62 = 42¬∞C

0.68 - heat generation value in wattage from above calc.

62 - C/W - JUNCTION thermal resistance to ambient, found on MOSFET datasheet

42¬∞C - Above Ambient temperature


175-42 = 133¬∞C (271¬∞F)

175 - Max package temp (also found on datasheet)

42 - Above ambient from previous equation

133¬∞C (271¬∞F) - max ambient air temp
```

Ok, yeah that makes sense, thank you for clarifying that for me :) Also I was curious, had you ever considered adding a 3rd led/zener to just drive that led on the switch at 12V? Seems to me that this would be another viable option, although again you may need a decently high rated resistor (~0.5W), possibly get away with a 1/4 W

Theoretically you could, but I see no point to doing so as a resistor would server the same purpose and you would need a big wattage zener. Also if you were thinking of using it as a small 12V source, no just no lol.

Cool again thank you for the advice. Below is the schematic for my switch. I will be using all SMD's except for the FET's which will be through holes as well as the barrel plug and through holes for soldering in battery/motor wires etc... Was wondering if someone could just give me a quick double check on this?

Yeah everything looks good with your schematic, id just recommend changing the 47K pull downs to 10K, but you dont have to.

Awesome! thanks for the quick feedback. BTW I am also going to be designing a pcb for taking in CH1 and CH3 from the GT-2B and output LED headlight and underglow control via an on-board arduino. Again, I currently have it all working on my board now but it's a perfboard hodge podge mess with a rat's nest of wiring. I'll post some pics and schematics soon if anyone is interested.

Will do. I'll probably post them in a different thread and link it in here (Keep this on topic with the switch). I already have the code pretty much sorted out, have been trying it on my board I am finishing up not and works quite nicely. Though I did have to upgrade the onboard regulator and shunt capacitor on the arduino pro-mini as the output from my 12v step down buck regulator (https://www.amazon.com/DROK-converter-Regulator-Modified-Transformer/dp/B00CGV5NT4/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_img_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=GZM7G94KRQWYH6ZEVCP5) was too noisy at turn on that it kept frying Arduinos. 

Also modified my schematic a bit, wen to SB5200TA for both my flyback diode and charger reverse polarity protection. I did this simply for ease of ordering 2x of the same component as opposed to having many different components. This shouldn't be a problem as it is rated at 200V and 5A correct?
http://www.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&itemSeq=231034655&uq=636334845351356541

Also switching my pull down resistors to 20k and using 2x 20k parallel resistors for my switch LED current limiting. I chose to parallel the two 20k's in order to halve the power consumption by half on each one so that I could use 1/4W resistors and still have a decent safety margin on them, does this sound right? 
below is the updated schematic.

@JdogAwesome 
Been working on my pcb layout and from what I've seen looking at some online calculators and such, the high current traces need to be massive to handle even 20A of current. I was wondering what kind of trace widths and copper weight you used in your pcb?

Hey Justin (I'm also a Justin lol) just now getting around to answering DM's and messages been really busy lately. I always use 2oz copper from Osh Park and I'm not sure exactly what my traces sizes are but using a calculator should give you a rough estimate, just remember to bump the ambient temperature rise to about 25C or else itll give a larger trace size. Also if you want to have smaller traces you could just have no solder mask on the traces and put a layer of solder on top of them to make them thicker. And your schematic from your last reply looks good!

Hi I'm looking to purchase one of your connectors?  I would like one that looks like the one from Torqueboards but actually works...lol  How much do you charge @JdogAwesome  Do you have a website to order from?

Hey @Tomer [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzLpefQ-7x-gaEt1MFlhdXRPQWs/view?usp=sharing) is the link to my newest designs the "New Compact Switch" folder is my newest design which I will be selling. 

@encore1906 hey Encore thanks for your interest in my switch, which I think is what you mean by connector right? Anyways if you are, my switches cost $35 a piece and are the most compact on the market, from what I know. They also come with a blue LED push button as well as XT60's, just DM me if your interested! ATM the PCB's are still being fabricated so it could still be 2-3 weeks before I have them in stock. Pic below is what the finished PCB will look like if your interested. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/5/a5e414823640463c8706c3e68e5a8dc5a24d9a72.png" width="690" height="334">

@JdogAwesome I'm new to this platform and I don't see an option to be able to DM you.  Here is the type of setup I'm looking for.  Hope this helps.  What would be the total cost of this one.  I had a Torqueboard one but the power just stays on and won't shut off which is now not allowing me to plug things in without sparks. I'm needing a bullet connectors on one end and a XT90 connector on the other end like the images below.  Can you do this?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/e/7edfa220cfabce3c1c24898115773f77d553fdfa.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

@encore1906 if you click on my name there should be a button that says "message" just click that. Anyways yeah I suppose I could do XT90's and bullets but id have to charge you like a small fee like $5 for the extra parts if thats ok. Also what size bullet connectors?

@Kaly Yup my switch should work from 6-12S LiPos, technically it could work with upto 14S (60V) but I wouldn't risk it, and not many people use batterys above 12S.

@JdogAwesome thats what I figured but I didn't see any Message button this is what I see.  That's fine I'm okay with the $5 extra for the parts. What is the max Battery Cell yours can take...10S, 12S??? But anyways I would like to go ahead and purchase your Power On/Off Switch with XT90 connector on the Out (+/-) side and 5mm bullet connectors on the In (+/-) side. So my total I'm looking around $40 correct? You can email me I'm ready to purchase.  I'll also give you a shout out on my YouTube channel (YouTube.com/CKid86)<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/2/223ad6f3512b41c049219c64a50fbbd792817c2b.jpg" width="690" height="494">

Pic below should be how to message be, but anyways my switch can handle upto 12S technically 14S but I wouldn't push it that far. You said XT90's on the output and you mean the same type your old switch had on the pic you took? And ill put 5mm bullets on the inputs. Ill email you with some more info, also like I said my PCB's are still being manufactured so it could be 2-3 weeks before the switches are ready.
