I just ordered all the parts for the current build I'm doing and I am down to being confused by one last thing. I purchased 2 Torqueboards 6374 motors and a Focbox Unity and am unsure/cant find any information about the hall sensor connectors. Will these plug directly into the Unity or do I need an adapter like on other VESC's and if so does anyone have any good suggestions? I also ordered these to adapt the motor cables:Wire Extensions 3.5mm to 5.5mm Ã— 2
Is there anything else Im missing here or need to think about?

Thanks!

@Aeorbis  The Unity uses JST-PH 2.0mm pitch connectors for the sensors, and the Torqueboards motors use JST-ZH 1.5mm pitch connectors. You will need an adapter.
