 Is it safe if i removed the fans to make them silent? Im Worried if they would overhear or not? I Currently have a mtb setup so they are top mounted and not in any kind of enclosure so they get good air circulation

A while ago i was thinking about this myself, did a bit of diggin on other sites i could only find RC enthusiasts taking the fans off at 6s but they had no problems. I suppose if its a hot day/night and you go hard you may have problems at 8s tho...

Im currently running  8s but that been said we dont usually get hot weather here (UK), although right now we kinda are in a 24Â°C heatwave so once the weather gets back to normal i may give it a try lol.

I'm in the UK too, southeast coast and it's muggy AF ATM...
 
I'm guessing the Max6 has a overheat cutoff as i have never seen or heard of any fires/heat deaths, i think i'm going to use them on my Emtb build because they're so bulletproof.
"still :thinking:about the Escapes on 10s" 

Oh and if you do a hard no fans ride test make sure its on soft ground bro just in case things go south, and share results :wink:
