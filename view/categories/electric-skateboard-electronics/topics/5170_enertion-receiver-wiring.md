I found a diagram on how to connect the three wires on the Vesc, but now I don't know what to hook these to on the receiver chip that came with this. Very frustrating....

Thank you! But I already figured it out (and blew a drv chip on a brand new enertion vesc) Man, I am sick of this Vesc crap. I have 4 ebikes that I made without a problem, the vesc is a whole different can of worms, I should have just waited a couple years for everything to be plug and play.....

Post details of your setup, how you have the vesc configured and exactly what the symptoms are so we can help.

Well, now because bldc wasnt working, I went back to FOC mode with one of two carvons hooked up. I am at work right now, so I only rode it around for a minute, but it seems to be working. Doesn't seem to have much torque, and the brakes are not very effective though. I will post some settings later after I have a chance to test it more..
