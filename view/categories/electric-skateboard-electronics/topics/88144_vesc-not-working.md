So I'm running a vesc I with bench wheel remote and sometimes the motors spin up and sometimes they don't. From what I understand if the receiver is rapidly flashing it means the receiver is bound and that a blue and green LED on the vesc means that it's fine (see picture). I put some heat shrink on the vesc and tested to see if motors spin. No motor output. I took it off and tried again and the motors spun. I rebooted and tried for the third time (no heatshrink) and it didn't work again. What seems to be the issue here. 

Thanks in advance![15534543599637602404930496846103|666x500](upload://AsT2gmDJlsBCZj6rCjekJxQXxUk.jpeg)

Make sure there aren’t any loose phase leads, or bullet connectors. Also make sure you’ve done the motor detection correctly
