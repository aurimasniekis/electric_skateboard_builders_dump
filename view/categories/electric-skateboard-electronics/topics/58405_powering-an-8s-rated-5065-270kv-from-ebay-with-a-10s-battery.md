Hey I bought 2 5065 270kv motors from ebay (https://www.ebay.com/itm/N5065-5065-270KV-Brushless-Motor-For-DIY-Electric-Skateboard-Scooter-Multicopter/401293060506?epid=16015859208&hash=item5d6eee299a:g:ZXgAAOSwGllaZv-y)
And in the descrription, it's written : "Lipo: 3S-8S (11.1V-29.6V)" but it's also written "Max. Voltage: 41.5"
So, could I power these 2 motors with a 10s battery ?
thank you for your answers
