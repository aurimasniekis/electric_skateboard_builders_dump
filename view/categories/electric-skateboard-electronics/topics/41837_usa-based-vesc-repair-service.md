Hello everyone, I'm finally fully launching my repair service. I've recently purchased all new equipment and I have most every component for VESCs in stock. All prices include return shipping back to you and repairs take about a week from the day I receive them to show back up at your door! This may vary if you send me a VESC that looks like you tossed it in a fireplace or took it scubadiving. Feel free to PM me on here for an inquiry, or you can visit my website https://theboardtech.com/ and fill out the contact form on there. Bulk discounts are available, and I'll be running sales until the end of this month to hopefully pay off all of this new equipment. On all repairs you can pay after the repair is complete, and all items are shipped USPS priority (usually 3 days or less in continental US). You only have to contact me by the end of the month to get the sale price, as long as you ship your VESC out within 2 weeks or so I'll honor the price!!

I appreciate everyone who participated in the free repair period. Feel free to contact me for any future repairs :wink:

Just wanted to hop on here and say that my FocBox repair from @ThermalM16 came back working "perfectly"... I'm still working out some settings so I don't kill myself!

I've got a VESC that failed.  Lights still come on, and I can read it with the BLDC tool.  But I can't log via the UART and the motor doesn't turn.  How does your pricing work?  I'd like to get this one repaired.  Thanks!
