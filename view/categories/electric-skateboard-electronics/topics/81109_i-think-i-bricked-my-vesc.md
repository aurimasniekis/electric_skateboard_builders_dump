I think I bricked one of my VESCs its lights blink blue and the receiver for the remote I’m using doesn’t have power (all connections are good) also when I plug it into my computer to the VESC tool it says “No Port” does this mean it is bricked or something else I have tried 3 different computers as well as 2 different cords both the VESCs are saying “No Port” when I plug them in but only one is blinking also when I put the receiver into my other vesc it doesn’t come on. I have been working on this for weeks now and have only riden it once.

Not to sound totally careless but did you click connect on the vesc tool?

Although I think there is something else wrong in your case, since you have no power to the receiver, here is a thread I made when one of my Focboxes got bricked.

Also possible he is trying to connect via the wrong COM port.  

Try the other COM port options
