Would that confirm the vesc is not bricked? Getting DRV error and motor really struggles to move. My batteries are charged to storage could that be causing an issue?

Thanks for the response. It's from HK but I had it almost a year without using it. 

Is this fixable I saw you can use an SWD? Or should I try get it replaced from HK?
