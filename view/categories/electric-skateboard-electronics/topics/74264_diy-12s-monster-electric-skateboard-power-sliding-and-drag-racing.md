Search in the forum for builds threads. You'll find plenty.

so what are the questions? @Grozniy his tip is very handy and I think with some more research you will know  a lot more :grinning:
But to help you for searching: you will need 2 motormounts and a truck with it and some biggg motors the bigger the better. Dickyho or  boardnamics sell very cheap motormounts that look good (I don't know if they are good but I heard positive feedback) and you can buy big cheap motors from banggood or aliexpress

good luck!

just regarding about the components, from the video they said it needs a high discharged battery in order to get ridiculous speeds. some parts in the build he used is not available in my country (philippines) but i found an alternative(?) but idk if it's compatible or suitable for the build.
Turnigy Heavy Duty 5000mAh 3S 60C Lipo Pack since i have little knowledge about esk8. what would you recommend if i want to build an esk8 that is very fast and can ride up a hill easily like on a video, since i live very far away from downtown/like the main city or smth :joy:

so i just have to connect 3 of it in a series to get 12s ryt? i have a question also about batteries what if i use a battery that has 6000mAh than the 5000mAh battery. is it compatible or will it toast the components of the board

3 in series will get you 9s.

Itâ€™s not suggested to use 2 different types of batteries

Man. I know it's easy to ask questions instead of searching in the forum. Please search. All the answers are here.
For this specific question: you want as much C count and Amp as possible. 4x3s will be 12S. Only Focbox, vesc 6, ESCape are reliable on 12s. Every other vesc is good on 10s.
More mah with the same S count, is more range. More C count is less voltage sag.

Yeah its better to search around first on the forum or ask sometimes the noob question thread, the question is also: do you realy want such a beast of a longboard as your first board or build firstly some experience with electric skateboarding (and building) with a board thats still good but not a 12s 2x 6374 beast

sorry for being a nuisance, i'll try and search more in the forums next time. you're right i should build some experience first. i was just fascinated by the 12s 2x 6374 build since i kinda want my board to handle such speed and power since i live far from the city. sorry again

Fyi: it bothers me that in the video is says: most electric skateboards have cheap low quality cells. It's not entirely true.  All generic hub boards use 30q and 20700b cells. Which are the best between price/quality. But they only use 10s2p. The other boards use lipo with low discharge.
If you build a 40cell plus battery of either these 2 cells,  it will be great.

im okay with 15-20 miles but i think it's kinda overkill so maybe 10-15 miles maybe? :3

32km of range: 
urethane wheels 15wh/km: 10s4p 30q cells =29.6km this means 12ah battery
Pneumatic wheels 22wh/km: 10s6p 30q cells = 30.27km this means 18ah battery

There are MANY builds like this.  And many that are cleaner and better done even.  Not that there is anything wrong with this build or anything, but as you look around, I am sure there are more builds that will get your heart pounding ðŸ˜‰

As you are looking for inspiration and knowledge a key thing to consider is cost, naturally.

To build a performance board costs quite a bit.  Not that you can't do it on a tight budget, but there are always unforseen costs.  When you start getting serious about building, I would say step 1 is to determine your budget. That will help determine what is practical for you and will help others to recommend the best parts for your budget and desired level of performance.

Have fun on your research!  Before you know it, you will be addicted!

Check this build thread out looks like the specs match your criteria pretty well. And like @skunk said try to jump on the Black Friday sales. Also make sure to budget for a good helmet and set of pads/protection if you plan on riding fast or aggressively (which it sounds like you are). An super awsome fast build does you no good if you're too hurt to ride.

Stay on here if you really love esk8 you will find so much information here you would be able to do anything. I had 0 esk8 experience when ive started here and in under 2 years ive built several boards much faster than the one you linked :slight_smile: knowledge is power 

also we are all here and would be glad to help when you get stumped, but try to learn as much as your can on your own it will be an invaluable experience.
