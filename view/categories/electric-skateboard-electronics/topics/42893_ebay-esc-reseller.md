Hi I'm looking to buy this sort of esc which many refer to as "ebay esc". <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/a/aae1c3c585889a11fcb400f56b8de547e095bb07.png" width="500" height="346">
However there is a few different sellers, all selling this esc however they give different specs and most importantly different shipping times.
What I'm a asking is is there any difference between the escs? 
For example this one: https://www.ebay.com/itm/322629605298
and this one: https://www.ebay.com/itm/single-motor-electric-longboard-skateboard-controller-ESC-Substitute/302546263597?hash=item4671299e2d:m:mGesvI1BOEcyvrLVbfKGQ8Q

Also if anyone knows about another source with faster shipping time pls tell me that would be greatly appreciated :)

Yeah, I don't see any difference. I'm guessing they're probably coming from the same factory but have different resellers.

I have bought the one sold by e-board-shop, and it works well for me. If you know who dicky ho is, it is sold by him.

Sometimes they "borrow" The pics and actually the product is not exactly the same. I had some experiences like that. In this case it could be the same product...
