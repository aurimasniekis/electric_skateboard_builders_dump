I just want to see what sort of potential for battery demand there is in the UK?. And if so who would want what packs? I can do standard packs to clear wrap, cell level fused packs. Flat or short. The payment would have to come after its built because of my level. Turnaround 2-3 weeks

I would be very keen for that to happen! Learning from the best would definitely help. Especially regarding how postage would work

Have you made previous packs? You could showcase some pictures from those builds?

I am also about to make my first battery pack but making sure I dont fuck it up

No I've recently branched into esk8 but I'm familiar with the physics and electronics associated and could produce high quality packs. I've watched and read a lot
