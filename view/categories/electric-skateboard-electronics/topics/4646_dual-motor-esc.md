I've seen reviews in the past that led me to think that alienpowersystem products are a bit sketchy, however I was cruising the website and found this:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/24b7e3ef8c193b5e8f172eab1de77dcbb4960147.png" width="281" height="500">

I was wondering, has anybody tried using one of these with a dual motor board? It looks to me like it would make things a whole lot easier... Any thoughts?

That's made by flyer I'm pretty sure.  U can find it on alibabaexpress.  I had a supposed 8s one snap into flames on first start up.   Cleaner look with the one unit but inefficient and not nearly as good as vescs in so many ways.

I rided 150a 8s version with space cell for about 100km before blowing that, but i liked the esc so much i ordered flyers 12s to replace it (still waiting). but its easy low tech option IMO

This belongs in the electronics category.

I ordered one of these and experienced issues. It would blow the fuse In my space cell without any load just running the motors to max rpm. I returned that and bought vescs and boy is there a huge difference. Vescs are the way to go.
