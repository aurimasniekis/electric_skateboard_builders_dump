A small recap of the dual  ESC V2.1 from diyeboard.com

**good:**
* very nice FOC-mode (nearly noisless)
* "handbrake" - function (push brake during standstill and the board will not move at all)
* integrated RF
* integrated powerswitch
* pricepoint: $88.00 incl. shipping for a dual motor controller!

**bad**
* as far as i can tell the throttle control is some kind of limited speedcontrol (not current) which reduces the acceleration. (see [video](http://sendvid.com/f0z5glh2):  ESC V2.1 vs vesc[BLDC])
* the productkiller in its current stage is braking: 
while braking works, the transition from idle to breaking is very sudden and not nearly as smooth as a vesc2.18.You really have to brace yourself for each breaking maneuver in order not get thrown of the board.

If diyeboard enables a way to change the breaking behaivour (customizable firmware etc.) this driver would be awesome. But in its current state im going back to vesc's

Totally agree, you absolutely need smooth brakes especially if you are going very fast.

I have used Escâ€™s that where programmable and no matter how it was set, the brakes where still terrible and even dangerous 
There is just nothing like a Vesc

You have to solder it. Oldskool.
Don't know who actually manufactures these escs, but you will find multiple brands/resellers and a large variety of different Chinese ESKs incorporating these. 

Another downside would be 25a per motor max.
