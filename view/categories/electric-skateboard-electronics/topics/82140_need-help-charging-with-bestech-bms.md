Hi, 

I have just wired up all the electronics on my board. I have a power brick that will charge up my 10s Samsung 30q battery using an XLR connection. I know that with the bestech BMS the eswitch has to be on for it to charge. 

However when it is plugged in to charge the led light on my switch and my percentage indicator light up as well as my vesc. This is  when the switch is closed, and the power brick is plugged in. 

I'm not sure if this is something to worry about our not. Also the percentage indicator will begin to rise quickly when the charger is plugged in ( without the switch being on). But when the switch is on the percentage indicator will lower back down to the battery level. 


Thank you so much for any help
