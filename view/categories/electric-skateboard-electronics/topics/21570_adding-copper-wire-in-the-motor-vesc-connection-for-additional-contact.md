Hi there,

I've been experiencing some problems with my build and my theory is that the problem lies in the connection between Motor and Vesc (the 3 pins): the female part of the Vesc is too large, reducing the contact surface (I found some "burning" marks on the male connectors, which seems to verifiy this hypothesis, I think?)

Anyway, my idea is to add some copper wires to tighten the connection without losing conductivity/contact surface. Can anyone tell me if that's fine for both Vesc and Motor? Here's what I mean:

I'd add some heat shrinking tubes around it.

Thanks in advance!

Yes I would imagine you are having problems. You are trying to plug a 4mm bullet connector into a 5.5mm socket.  Upgrade the male 4mm bullets to 5.5mm

Always good to have extras around.
