Hi guys!! 

I bought an battery from evolve (36v 10Ah) quiet cheap from eBay and reassembled it to fit in my enclosure... quite happy with the result but still have some open questions. 

What do your think what amperage could I draw from the battery by continuous discharge and charge? I have absolutely no idea. I heard that these batteryâ€™s are not the best because of the huge voltage sag... but doesnâ€™t matter for now. I already bought it ðŸ˜….

I only run a single 6364 190kv belt setup at the moment with motor max 50A, absolut Max 90A

Has anyone a suggestion for good values? 

Thx a lot!![image|666x500](upload://iBQtforTiG5dc8DTaRhRoLhpL7r.jpg)
