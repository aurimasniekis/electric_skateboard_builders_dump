The button on the back of the screen has likely been held down, it happened to me.
If you turn it on and it reads anything other than L10 this has happened.
So peel back a bit of the foam and move the first lot of chips out of your way (not too far though) and locate the button.
Hold this button down whilst turning on your space cell and it will flash on L3 press the button multiple times until it reads L10 and turn it off. When you turn it back on it will display L10.
