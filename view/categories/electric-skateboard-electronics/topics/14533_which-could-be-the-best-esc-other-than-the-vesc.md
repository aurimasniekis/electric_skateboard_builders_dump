Been through 2 burned VESCs, one with BLDC and the other with FOC, both DRV fried. 

I understand that it's an open source concept and there are many manufacturers out there that have different qualities and prices. there's a lot to learn, study, and there's still the risk for user error which is big.

I'm a little bit tired and frustrated so I want to move on to another ESC. 

What would be the best ESC other than the VESC?

x2 Torqueboards 12s esc. I have four of them. They are plug and play after you get rid of reverse, set the brakes, start up and voltage cut off.
