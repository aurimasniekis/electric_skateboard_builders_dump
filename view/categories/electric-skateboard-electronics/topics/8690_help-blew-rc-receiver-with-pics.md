Hey. Know I posted something similar but after that post I'm not sure why it blew. All was working fine, moved everything over to another board, plugged cables from the esc to the receiver and Boom. Loud bang. Their is visible damage on the receiver.
NOTHING was changed when switching decks

SETUP
2x 3s 5200mah multistar lipo 10c
Hobbyking 120a ubec boat esc
Rockstaa 2 in 1 set 
Aliendrivesystem motor and drive kit
Used 12awg turnigy wires for series connector etc
