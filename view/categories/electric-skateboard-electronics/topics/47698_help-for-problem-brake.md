-60 seems high. What battery are you using and what BMS do you have?

I am assuming its 25r and even still maybe your pulling to Much amps and trying to break at the same time cuz -60 is to high

im curious what a good number is for 25r's 12s7p. i had the same problem going down a hill, if i'm cruising at 20, it won't slow me down enough. almost had to bail in the city this past weekend!

I think he had his battery pack full and went down hill making the vesc shut off
Other theory check your connections maybe your phase wires touch causing a short

You can't go down hill at full battery going downhill and breaking makes energy and that to to the vesc and back to th fully charged battery making it over load and shut off

Well, you got a few issues here.
First, change your braking current to ~ -25.
each battery can handle 4a and 7 of them can handle max 28a.
Second, don‚Äôt go downhill with your battery full unless you‚Äôre trying to commit a suicide.

alright. so you can leave the -60a alone, but I recommend lowering the battery min to -15a or so

Is that the same settings you have on both vescs?
If so lower the battery min to ~13a and leave
the -60.

Common error on this thread :) :

If you go from -60 to -15, you're not lowering, you're upping because -60 < -15. It's just basic maths from school.

---
## \#48 Posted by: TarzanHBK Posted at: 2018-02-28T11:31:34.566Z Reads: 46

```
the minus just implicates that current beeing generated and flowing back into the vesc instead of out.
So if you type in -15, you¬¥re telling the vesc to take 15A in for a maximum. 
So -60 is a much stronger brake, than -15.

Set this value according to your battery max charging capability

I know that but maths are maths. If you want to say that going from -60 to -15 is lowering the value, it's ok for me but it's wrong anyway from a maths perspective (not sure this sentence is correct in English as I'm not a native English speaker).

The amount (magnitude) of current is the absolute value of that number. He's lowering the braking (negative) current. You're being pedantic about something where the OP is already confused and you're serving to only make it harder for him to solve his problem.

Question if I make my brake -40 
How much the battery min will be 
And if I do -60 and -15 for the battery min  my range would change or know 
And I will get more heat or no 

Thank you

Forget about the common laws of math, they don't apply in this case.
-60 means 60a amps regen
-15 means 15a amps regen
so in this case -60 is greater than -15

You're new and you decided to invest in a vesc6 and 12s7p?
I mean, unless you have extensive downhill experience or something, you went way overkill. Not trying to tell you what to do, just trying to say that these setups are not meant for new guys. Ves6 is still considered overkill even for the most seasoned esk8ers

That's called building bullet proof.  He can take the acceleration and too end in the settings and make it run like a single motor benchwheel if he decides to start that way.  Then can raise the values a bit at a time until he's comfortable slamming asphalt on a lightning powered murder board üòÄ.

I wish I had done it with my 1st build instead if blowing 600 bucks on shit. There's literally not a single piece left in use.
