I just got this in the mail today. But since I don't know much about this brand, version, quality, specs, or price, I would like to know your opinion? Is worth it?

Best buy for the price. Perfect up to 10s, BLDC, and Batt max 30A to stay safe. I have read of people using the Flipsky's VESC 4.12 in FOC and with 12s with no problem so far, but I won't risk to be honest.

@pixelsilva are you still researching for parts? Have you finished your first build? :smile:

I have bought one of these but it hasn't arrived yet so I can't give you my personal opinion. However, a did a lot of research before I bought it and found that many people like it. For the price as well I think its great.
