I have been trying to make a DIY spot welder from car batteries and Arduinos for weeks and have had no success. As a result I‚Äôve opted for soldering. I know the basics: don‚Äôt short, hot soldering iron and small contact time to reduce heat. However this is my first time and would appreciate any advice or help this community can give! 
I‚Äôm using nickel strip and 60 year-old lead roof welding tool as it has a huge thermal mass.

I can't say anything about how you've done because I probably know less than you, But Thanks for giving photos as an option here!

@darkkevind makes and sells Soldered battrey packs here, maybe he could give some input.

Nickel is not the easiest to solder on.
Guess you would go better by using a copper wire or bar.
Where are you located? 
Maybe somebody here can rent you a spot welder

```
*Weld the solder to the cell first.*
Then weld solder to the conductor. (nickel in this case)
Then weld them together.

Also, everytime you solder *anything* you should always try your best to pull them apart after cooling.  If you can pull it apart, it was a bad weld and needs to be redone anyway.  This **kind-of** applies to 18650s also.  You want to do that, but you don't want to accidentally short things out, either.

You should keep a piece of metal handy so that after you remove the iron you can press it on the end of the cell to suck the heat out faster and keep the heat from going as deep into the cell.

Also, protip: the positive connections are the most difficult, so it's better to troubleshoot those ends

Also if you're soldering, you may as well use copper and not nickel.

The nickel strip has been nice to me so far, I think it grips easier with the scuffs. I live in London. I‚Äôve tried to find people but no luck so far...

Sorry I don't want to be a dick, but just my 2 cents, this soldering work is awfull.
Better bring your cells to someone with the right tools and skills, this batteries can burn down your house easily.

Nothing in soldering is referred to as welding, so keep that in mind. 

1. It appears that you are using a pipe-soldering, soldering iron to do the work. That can work, but it takes lots of practice and skill. If I were you, I'd use the big soldering iron to tin the nickle strip, then use your other iron that I can see in the back which appears to be temperature controlled, to do the actually soldering of the nickel to the cell.

2. Prep your surfaces. Scuff your battery and nickle strips with sand paper to lightly turn the surface matt. Then clean the surface with isopropyl alcohol. 

3. Put a bit of flux on each surface to be soldered and then use your temperature controlled iron with a well tinned tip at ~450c or so to quickly touch the battery surface and then add just enough solder to get a little blob to stick. The little blob of solder should be shiny when it cools, and well adhered to the surface. This will take practice. 

4. This process of sticking a bit of solder to the surface before soldering things together is called tinning and is vital. Use the same process to tin the nickel strip at where you intended to join it to the battery.

5. With both surfaces tinned (battery and nickle strip), put the two tinned surfaces in contact and clamp them so that they won't move when soldering.  You can now use your still well tinned and clean soldering iron to heat the top of the nickel strip such that the tinned solder on the bottom melts, the melted solder from the nickle strip, should then melt the solder on the battery terminal and the nickle strip will sink into the top of the battery cell. When it sinks, remove the soldering iron and let it cool.

Spot welding is better, but if you must solder, do it as above for good results.

I THIRD this. Tinning is everything in soldering. makes solder absorb and require less heat when joining two parts

I saw you melted solder onto the top of the cell but it didn't appear to be stuck/welded/tinned.  Just physically touching.  I bet if you took a straight screwdriver, you could pop it off...

But then again prying on the end of an 18650 with a screwdriver is a very bad idea in general

No I can't because my English is worse than your soldering results.
Just for how it looks I will not storage a battery like this in my house.
Here in this forum is so many different post of burning batteries from people that knows what is doing. Anyway seems like you are on track to build a better battery. 
Also you are soldering in the negative pole witch is a lot more easier than the positive.
Maybe if just my paranoia since I live in a wooden house :)
Good luck dude!

I get that, I‚Äôve been very worried about fire and so I usually do it outside. In this case I didn‚Äôt see much risk as there‚Äôs little change of shortIng and with the soldering only touching briefly, heat damage is limited. I also have a fire extinguisher nearby. Hopefully by the end I‚Äôll have a battery I can be confident charging in a wooden house! The paranoia is definitely beneficial it could save you! Thanks for the explanation.

It either blows a hole in the nickel strip or when I attempted to use an arduino, something was wrong in the code and it cooked my starter relay.

I couldn't get mine to work well either, at the start it worked very good and now it can barely do a single layer weld.

Changed the tips and everything. I guess the car battery ran out of juice or something, no worries though I am making a MOT spot welder, a bit more portable

![20180828_215437|375x500](upload://oIP4MQCaO0Nly6rEtBm46KyqWLm.jpg)

Actually this is the new best advice.  18650s have a ton of energy trying to get out and they are dangerous.  Chemically similar to a stick of dynamite that can deflagrate instead of a detonate

Feel you dude.  I had a battery guru build mine for that very reason.  I am planning a battery but I'm no where near ready yet to commit.  Lucky you having some guidance in the process apart from the BZZZZZ   :joy:

I **don't** want to give the impression that I'm underestimating 18650 cells danger because I am very aware of this, however, what are the most common causes of fire when soldering? Heat damage? (I hold the iron on for seconds) Shorting? (I've used fish paper and am constantly checking)

A side question- is one strip of nickel enough? It's 0.15mm x 10mm

That can lead to shorting,which then could then lead to fire.

You can heat too much, degrading your battery, that damaged cell may end up being the cell that tires out quickly and eventually over heats. 

You can also drip solder between the anode and cathode.
