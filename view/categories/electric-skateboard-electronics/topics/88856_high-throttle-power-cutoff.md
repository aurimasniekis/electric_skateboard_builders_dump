I am using a VESC 4.12 from torque boards and a SK3 6374 192kv with 10s (10s4p 30q w/ 60a BMS). My max motor current is 80a and my max battery current is 40a, and I am using the GT2B remote with PWM and no sensors. Braking current is 15a.

When I push the throttle all the way to full when I'm not already going at a high speed, the board starts accelerating for about half a second, but then the power from the motor completely cuts, and I have to return back to 0 throttle before I can accelerate again (luckily I can still brake). Seems like if I'm asking for the board to accelerate at a high rate with a high amperage, the motor cuts off completely.

This has not been very problematic for me, but it has been somewhat dangerous, especially when I'm at higher speeds because I'm leaning forward and the sudden cutoff throws me forward. It's not a huge issue, but I do really want to get it fixed.

Do you use the vesc Tool or the bldc Tool to programm your settings? 
In bldc you could select, limit erpm with negativ torque, which means as soon as you reach your max erpm your esc break down.
If you use vesc tool that shouldn‚Äôt be the case.

Does it happens only when your battery is 100% charged?

Drop it to 50 motor amps and see if you still have the problem, if not bump it to 70a and so on until you find where the limit is.

I'm using the vesc tool. Is the bldc tool better?

No, the bldc tool is the old version of the vesc tool

im a bit worried about increasing the current. was curious to see how you sorted it out...

@Z4MSupreme @Andy87 Yeah I lowered the motor amps to 50A and increased battery amps to 50A. Seems to have fixed it, but my acceleration is a little slower.
