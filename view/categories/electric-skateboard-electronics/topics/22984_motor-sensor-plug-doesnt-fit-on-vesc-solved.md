I am putting together my new build and have purchased a sensored motor. However, the plug on the sensor wire does not match a socket on my vesc. The motor came with an additional wiring harness and a socket. Do I just need to cut and solder on the new plug?

Upload some pics of the adapters and plugs. Maytech makes a plug and play adapter if that's what you have.

Edit: is there a female end on the adapter?

The pic is what I have. The smaller is attached to the motor. The larger has 2" wires attached to it and are also a gauge or two larger.

I don't have a VESC in front of me but I think the sensor port is 7 pins. 

If that connector fits the sensors port then yes, you can just cut the wires from you motor and solder to the wires of you adapter.

6 pins!

black = GND
red = 5v
white = temp
the other 3 = hall sensors

The VESC lays out sensor wires differently than how typical chinese motors come. Make sure your red, black, and white cables are in the right positions.

Does this layout look right coming out of the vesc? Just match colors with wiring the two together?

Yep, unless the motor mfg decided to not follow typical electronics convention for whatever reason. Black, red, and white are standard. The sensors can be varying colors though.

I notice the colors in the connectors coming out the vesc are different for our connections. How do I know which order to wire in?

Im running a 6374, 190kv from @Kaly

Kaly's motors are plug and play with VESC according to his post, shouldn't have to change anything.

Nope, I just got this one from him and the small plug is what comes attached.

Then you'll have to take out the leads on the VESC plug and put Kaly's in. However they may not fit in which cause just solder the VESC plug leads into the motor, the colors seem to match on the pic you have.

Ok great, That's exactly what I am doing now. However, the color order in your photo for the vesc wiring does not match the color order on the plug that came extra with my motor that does for the vesc. So I need to rearrange the pins in my plug to make sure the plug into the correct pin in the connector on the vesc?
```

Yep just reorder to it match the colors. Like I said, red/black/white are critical to be in the right position, but the others dont matter as long as they're going in the hall pins.

@Jinra I need a bit of help please,bout these motor for my vesc,the motor came with sensor connector but the are 5pin so I just ordered 6pin jst to used to connect but there will be one wire missing can you tell me how is it possible someone said leave the temp wire but I am new donâ€™t know which one it is ![image|230x500](upload://eQqJ1ifraMalnH6PbeHneNnQFkG.jpg)![image|230x500](upload://7L3hP7FUgUJjsTsJAxZcM7gKRWi.jpg)![image|375x500](upload://6D7pbChsUFwpPcAb8jL3DMVOmoT.jpeg)

If you read @Jinraâ€™s post he says temp is the white wire. Now look at @flywithgrifâ€™s pic which pin is the white wire connected to. That should be correct as long as the motor manufacturer used the right pattern

if you only face 5 pins it's fairly simple. black is ground, red is 5v and the rest are hall sensors

In my case here black - red + and the orange would be temp so I would leave that one out ![image|690x425](upload://3ozsJGSV22YRm1vwf6ZhRirUNhX.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://gh7YwPEYBtvARXwHhaw1T6GhBv3.jpeg)

Hi everyone, I just recently purchased a vesc from mboards and a torque boards 6355 260 kv motor. I was able to make an adapter to connect the bullet connectors but I am unsure how to wire the jst connector to my vesc since it is too small. The connector on my motor is a 6 pin.

I was wondering if I need to by a different connector and solder it to the motor wires so that it fits with the VESC.

```
Get 2mm jst plugs and pins.
Cut the wires, crimp new pins and plug it in.
Ready to go.
If your sensor cables to short than just solder some 2mm jst extension on and good

Are these the 2mm jst connectors you are talking about?

If you donâ€™t want to make anything you can get some of them

If no than you need that one you choose but with 6pins not with 2

On the back side of your vesc there should be written which pin is what.
Donâ€™t mix + and - (red and black or better to say first and last pin)
Sensor wires donâ€™t mind which place they are

Normally you would get a adopter with it,if there is none,like I did buy a bigger jst connector and weld the wires ![image|230x500](upload://v5ofwHSo3bfPOizs7XTKCTFW4eZ.jpeg)![image|230x500](upload://3vuvVZ7AGv2sdtfDYN6v87bZp1S.jpeg)![image|230x500](upload://rTny6auwSn7XKDTFdnoJQQc3fWC.jpeg)![image|381x500](upload://3iwpKuugd6n00wbKgvQfaYFTUh1.jpeg)![image|354x500](upload://6i0Tp3KZChoU3BSBsWxshgOb5rG.jpeg)

Thatâ€™s it.
Red is 5V black is ground.

alright thanks andy, and so I just need to get the positive and negative in the right spot and the rest don't matter where they connect correct?
```

## \#34 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-09-09T08:15:13.730Z Reads: 127

```
Thatâ€˜s correct!
The sensors itself can be on any position on the plug as long as itâ€™s not the plus or the ground.

To be not confused, the cable color from your torque board motors should have the right order already. The red 5V the black is ground.

If you have any other issues just let us know ðŸ˜‰

@Jinra Hi i have the same problem @Redfire1 had in that my sensor wire on my motor only has 5 pins and my vesc needs 6. How exactlt do i plug it into the vesc?

On the Vesc look on the other side it should say 5v+, GN- ,temp hall etc,you donâ€™t need the temp connection,try get a wiring diagram for you motor find the +and - and connect them the rest donâ€™t really matter how you connect them,thatâ€™s what I did and it work.![image|230x500](upload://3vuvVZ7AGv2sdtfDYN6v87bZp1S.jpeg) ![image|230x500](upload://rTny6auwSn7XKDTFdnoJQQc3fWC.jpeg) ![image|381x500](upload://3iwpKuugd6n00wbKgvQfaYFTUh1.jpeg) ![image|354x500](upload://6i0Tp3KZChoU3BSBsWxshgOb5rG.jpeg)
