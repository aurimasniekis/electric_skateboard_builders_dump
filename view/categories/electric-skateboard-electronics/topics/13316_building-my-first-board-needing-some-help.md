Yep - you are simply missing the male plug on the board (white plug part on the left side of your pic.  Simply solder directly to the connections and it's even better than the connector.  No muss no fuss.

Find a newer example - i'm not sure which pins changed from the older 6 pin connector pictured to the 7 pin on 4.12 and similar.

Or even better yet - get a GT2b and skip the nyko...  (my suggestion).  But do some digging and search - I know this is covered repeatedly and you should be able to find the wiring pic that is more current.

GL!
