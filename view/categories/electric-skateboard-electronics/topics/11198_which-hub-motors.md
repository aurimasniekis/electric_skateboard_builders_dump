I know there are other posts about this, but some seem slightly outdated.

I just want to know what Hub Motors you guys would recommend.

CarvOn seems to be a slight favorite, but they seem pretty expensive. This would be a Single Motor Build, and strictly used for flat ground. Any Suggestions?

Thanks.

There is a reason they are more expensive. They work.

Iâ€™m extremely happy with my CarvOn hubs. What sold me was the maturity of the platform as @LEVer is revving on v3 while other offerings are still in their first iteration.

@Hummie is coming out with a motor that is longer so you can use it for single drives. steelhubs.com is where you buy them

You have any suggestions on a deck? I'm rocking a 46" flexy af sector 9 board atm. Want to get something with medium flex around the 36" range.

Have a look at some websites such as daddies, muir skate etc. Input the specs you want and it will show you a few. Also check out some threads on this forum such as this:
