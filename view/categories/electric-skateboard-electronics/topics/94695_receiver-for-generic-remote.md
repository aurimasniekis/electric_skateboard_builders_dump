New to the community, and I've foolishly decided it was a better idea to build a board instead of buying one.  Eh, the challenge seems like it'll pay off in the end.  I've hit a roadblock I haven't been able to research my way through, though.  I purchased a generic remote off eBay and it didn't come with a receiver.  From what I've been reading, you need a compatible receiver and can't just buy any old cheap one... the seller has no clue about this so I have no idea where to find a suitable receiver.  For reference, I bought one of these:

Anybody out there have any experience/advice?  It almost looks like a flysky remote, I think, but the buttons are different.
