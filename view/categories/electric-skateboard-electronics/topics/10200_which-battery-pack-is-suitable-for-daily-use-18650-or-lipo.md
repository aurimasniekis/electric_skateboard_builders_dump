Hi guys 
I build a e board for daily commuter.
I live in  Taiwan  that is on the tropical zone, it is subject to more rain than most other areas
I ruin my first lipo battery over discharge
I also ruin a 18650 pack from taobao .
The 18650 bms is very bad. Quality.
So I need choose new battery for home to office trip(1.9km) 
Could you provide your suggestion?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/4/a4eb9442dd7f09e25b6c620affa7b05a44129626.jpg" width="375" height="500">
Rain cover from my targus backpack. I hope this cover can provide the a little rain resistance for my battery and esc<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/c/9cf3fa8608ba9c268012c7fb9be5d03223fb76eb.jpg" width="375" height="500">

If you're over discharging, get a battery monitor and stick on the board where you can see it. Never let the cells go below 3.4V. Ideally stay close to 3.7.  As for the battery just make sure the max current (C x Ah) is at least 100A (5Ah x 20C = 100A) and maybe invest in a good charger that lets you control charging better and obey the max charge current for your battery.
