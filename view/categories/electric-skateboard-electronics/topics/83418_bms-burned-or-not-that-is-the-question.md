Hello all, working on my battery, at one of the last step of it, I short circuited the 2 charge wires, linked to the BMS.
Big spark, big jump scare, but now I'm mostly afraid to have destroyed my bms.
I hope not, and I don't have my multimeter to test it, so I'm calling help to you.
My hope would be that because it is only 22AWG wires, not much current would have flown through, the short circuit was almost instantaneous.
How could I test it ? Without a multimeter, so I got to be creative
Pluging to the vesc and see if it says undervoltage ?
Pluging to the charger and see if it will allow it to charge ? 

Thanks, and see you for another sparky adventure !
