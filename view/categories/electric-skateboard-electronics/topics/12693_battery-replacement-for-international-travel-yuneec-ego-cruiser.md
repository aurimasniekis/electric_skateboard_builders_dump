Hi Tung, do you have any progress on this?

I also would like to replace my yuneec e-go battery. When I bought my sk8 the flight company did not allowed me to bring the battery. So I lost this one. I have a full sk8 without battery and I'm thing on use anything else. 

I don't care about stetics. Anybody can help?
