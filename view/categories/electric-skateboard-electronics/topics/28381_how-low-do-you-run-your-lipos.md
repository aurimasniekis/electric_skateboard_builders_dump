I am running a 6s 5000mah lipo. I also have a battery percentage indicator. How low can I go without damaging the battery.

I only run my lipo cells down to about 3,7 v pr. Cell. You Can Run them down a bit more, but i like not to damage my lipos to quick. On my battery indicator it's about 40-50% for some reason.

I run to 3.7 also that way I don't need to charge back up to storage.

Well as far as I know you can run LiPos down to 3.2V per cell witout any significant damage.

Have mine set to start cut off at 3.8 and end a 3.6, you can get more than .5V drop while under load and if the cells get over the voltage cliff they never fully recover.  You can push the LiIon (18650) cells quite a bit further down and depending on the arrangement might get more or less voltage sag (more parallel means less sag, more amps can be delivered, same with higher C rating batteries). LiPo still has better energy density though from what I've read so you get more energy per unit volume for the most part (various chemistries in different form factors make blanket statements difficult)

Running down to 3.6 on a 5Ah battery when I recharge I put back about 3400mAh so it is about 70% of the rated capacity used.  Could go a few tenths lower to use more of the actual capacity but I get 12miles or so on a full charge and if I want more I want double not a few extra miles and risking the batteries.

Anywhere from 3.7-3.5, usually around 3.6ish to be safe.

Thats because the battery indicator is a percentage of linear voltage, not actual capacity.  For example, mine shows 3.7V cell nominal voltage as 44% (=44.4V @ 12S).  3.85V is 62% (=46.2V).  4.00V is 80% (=48.0V).  Notice a pattern?  At first I did not like this percentage reading, but now I look at it as a simplified representation for voltage

Another meter I tested did something similar, but was not nearly as consistent with the % to Voltage "conversion".  (e.g., 44% was not exactly 44.4V on 12S).  Therefore your results may vary...

I think main problem with indicators if u use them for lipos, is that 0% is at 3v, which is more suited for li ions

Im not really sure is it possible to change this.in.any way..

I've been running my lipos down to 3.1 or 3.0 for a year or so and I've been fine. I'm pretty sure you can run them down to 3.2 and be totally safe, and 3.0 is pushing it a little. 

If you only run them down to 3.7, your range must be terrible. Like a 12s 5000mah lipo set up only discharged to 3.7 volts would only get like 5 miles of range max, while discharging them to 3.1 per cell gets you like 14 miles range and is fine for the cells
