I would like to know if I put a battery indicator in the location indicated in the diagram with a switch in the position it is shown, would that hurt the battery or the system in any way? Or would it be better to just put the indicator on the loopkey circuit? 
If I did use the switch, would this one work: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D285PLL/ref=twister_B07D27MVPR?_encoding=UTF8&th=1 ![IMG_3590|666x500](upload://dplRp1t1YM1xVungmDUEoX4ELmo.jpeg)

You'll be fine either using that switch or using the loopkey.

You can get something like this

with this battery meter you can switch on/off or better just get the + from the back of the loopkey.
With it the indicator only switched on when your board is switched on.
