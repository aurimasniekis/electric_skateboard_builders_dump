```
@onloop will know for sure, but that looks like a temperature sensor from the pic.

That wire isn't supposed to be connected, as @treenutter said, it's a temp sensor.

Voltage check al of your balancing wires, as that could be the issue. If one of the voltages was off, then the BMS would let the battery turn on.

faulty switch or dead BMS

try cutting the power leads to the switch, and twisting them together. 

If it turns on, then it is a faulty switch; if it doesn't then it is something BMS/wiring related

was it like this:

looks like it might have been a thermistor for the BMS to me?

that and your switch is faulty.

@lowGuido thermistor is easy to find here , hopefully its easy to find that BMS . or i'll have to wait for shipment from china . 


so ?!  ok ...
i soldered back that thermistor once i got a new one ?
