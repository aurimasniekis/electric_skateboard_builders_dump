I just got done wiring my VESC and it turns on fine, but when I go to do motor detection, it says it fails. It'll spin up like it's fine, but still says fail.
Any ideas?

Check out this thread and make sure you went through all the steps properly. If everything looks correct, changing some of the values small increments at a time should solve your problem as mentioned in this thread.

Got it all straightened out. VESC is running very smooth with the R-Spec motor. Finally figured out most of the things, though FOC does not work for me.

Thanks for the references.
