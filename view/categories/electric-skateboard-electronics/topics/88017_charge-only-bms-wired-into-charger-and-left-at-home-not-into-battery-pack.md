This is more a question for my bike build. 14s2p battery pack using compression holders will live in a small saddle bag under the seat along with the controller. I am trying to minimize the space required by the batter and controller, and am thinking about trying to wire the BMS in a modular way so that I can leave it at home with the charger and not have to fit it into the pack. 

I would have all lead and battery wires setup with connectors and be able to remove the battery and plug into BMS and charger at home. 

Just curious if anyone has tried this type of setup and if there are any glaring technical issues that I'm not considering. Thanks!
