could anyone please help me find some Flat ground Cable within EU.... 
I am trying to have a clean build but running cables from motors to esc is a big hassle. I have seen the teardown of the Boosted Board and i have seen those flat cables that run on the board under the grip tape ( great insulator ) and i have to admit it is an awesome idea. 
the only one that i have found up to this moment:
http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/alpha-wire/1231-SV005/A1231SV-100-ND/424115

but it is sold in a 30m reel and costs way to much. I need a max on 1.5m for my build....
Any help would be highly appreciated...

I would recommend just buying from china / aliexpress.. if you are not that far in your build and can wait.. then no problems..

search tinned braid wire

http://www.ebay.com/bhp/tinned-copper-braid

I used it to make parallel connections for the battery.

Otherwise.. search google, I found quite many results, though a lot of these were from usa.. perhaps there are some in Eu..

thanks mate. Sadly i am yet to find anything within the EU, but as you have mentioned i have found the US based shops or the China based ones. Since it is winter in EU i will happily wait for the cable to arrive. until then i will also have to build my battery.
 i consider this thread closed...

Try flex braid from storm power components if you cant find anything... Theyre based in the US though. 
They have 12ga equivalent flat braid. I think it was .375"x.03"

Yeah there's not much about is there?

These two other ones I had in my watch list:
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/3-3Ft-1Mx11mm-Copper-Braided-Shielded-Circle-Flat-Cover-Flexible-Sleeve-Tool-/131971041441?hash=item1eba1648a1:g:3RYAAOSw4shYAc3i

You could always send them a message to find out what the AMP rating is.

I've looked up on a chart and 4mm x 1mm should be around 50amps.

need about 1.5 m of 1/4" or about 6mm wide. 1 mm thickness should be the best. As i have seen this kind of flat cable has about 32A resistance when made with AWG36

Thanks mate. Sadly both of the cables are way to wide for my needs. I would have no space on my board to put 3 strips close to each other on one side of truck hangar. Max needed is about 6 mm wide 1 mm thick.....

I use thin PCB material cut to the width I want. I actually run one big ground and several thin ones for the balance leads.

To everybody who has helped with an idea or a link. This is the Result i was looking for. It is not finished but i presume that you will get the general idea. Some electrical tape will be used under the flat cable to be sure nothing will happen and also some epoxy will be used for the bullet connectors. :) any piece of advice, feedback or questions are welcomed :) 

thanks once again for the links.

why put the connectors next to each other horizontally when you could have put them vertically?
Also use some shrink tubing around the connectors!

```
you mean the connectors? ( they are not set in yet, hence no heat shrink yet. But will do that). If so than: because of the cable. If i had the connenctors vertically they would still need some space between them horizontally so that the cables won't touch

whitepony does not have a cnc mill. you don't need channels with the flat wire - just need to bend it so that it does not touch. But you have already drilled the holes so there is no point in this anyway.
