```
My hall sensors were working just fine before firmware up load and then right after when i went to the set up wizard to configure everything, it throws the bad foc hall detection result received fault. weird thing is that i can still run it in sensored mode with the default sensor table settings, it just runs real crappy and jumpy until it speeds up. And if i unplug my hall sensors in sensor mode the motor wont turn at all. Everything works as you'd expect in sensorless mode. I did nothing but upload firmware.
