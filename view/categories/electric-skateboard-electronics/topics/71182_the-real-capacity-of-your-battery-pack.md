Hi everyone!
I'm riding my new build for like 1000km and it still runs great! I just want to share some of my thoughts about my battery pack.
I'm just thinking about getting more range out of my pack because I think it can be better. I'm very happy with the max range I get now (25km agressive riding + 5km normal riding)

This is my board:

10S4P 30Q pack
60A bluetooth bms
Ownboard hubs
Ownboard esc
2A 41.5V charger

I discovered that if the battery hits around 3.5V / cell the board slows down and will completely stop at 3.2V / cell.
This is normal and programmed in the esc which is actually pretty healty for the batteries.

I can do around 25km of agressive riding and after that it gets 'boring' but it will still ride for like 5km.
I did a 25km ride yesterday and the board started so no boring ride and charged it (only took 4h)
I use a slow 2A charger and it charges at real 1.8A (I can see this in the bluetooth app from my bms) so that means 1.8A x 4h = ~7Ah

Now I was just inspecting the graphs of the samsung 30Q and chose the curve that shows these average values, so 7 / 4 = 1.75Ah / cell.

I was just thinking to use the new flipsky dual vesc so I could adjust the cut off voltage to get more range out of these beautiful cells.
I know the cells need to put out much more current when going to a lower voltage but I'm not planning to pump up the amps of the motors, just set them on 10A per motor (now I pull 9A per motor and its fine for me)
So I can ride 'agressive' for a longer time.

Has anybode ever switched from the standard hub esc to a vesc and got a much better range/performance of their battery?

I have switched to a vesc from a dual esc and noticed better performance but not really range as I never discharge my lipos below 3.6v so I donâ€™t hit the cut off.

However I do know that 18650 cells can safely discharge down to 2.8v and judging by that graph you would get an extra 4ah total or another 10-15km of range. That could be pushed further by dropping the cut off to 2.5v but that will lessen cycle life and potentially harm the cells

You can choose battery life (more charges, more miles out of it)

Or you can choose less range but longer life
