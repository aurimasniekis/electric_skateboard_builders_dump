If you really want to use Amazon I use these with no issue

high temp nylon and the connections have all been solid and straight in my pack.

I'd obv prefer hobby king, but I have a bunch of money for Amazon I want to spend on a board. I just want to make sure they're gonna be as reliable as ones from hobby king
