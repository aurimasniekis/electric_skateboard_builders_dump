Hi guys, I have a 12s4p 30q dual focbox setup with 40A max current breaking.

Wondering if a bestech BMS ( HCX D223 80A ) can handle 2x40A of breaking power as the datasheet is rated at 4A or 20A charging current.
I already have a supower 30A bms wich I could use for charging only but I like the E-switch on the bestech one.
Or I could go with a simple switch like the one from   electricskateboard.repair  ?

What would you choose ?
Thanks for your help !

Are you talking about motor min or battery min setting?
The D223 is rated 20a charge current.
You can set the motor min at -40a
And the Batt min at -10a 
This is for a dual drive.
