Hey guys thought id drop this crazy deal on here. Anyways was looking through Banggood and saw [4x Samsung 30Q](https://www.banggood.com/4PCS-Samsung-INR18650-30Q-3000mAh-Unprotected-Button-Top-18650-Battery-With-Protected-box-p-1184782.html?rmmds=cart) cells for $16.50 and thought it was a crazy steal. Looked at the reviews and they seem to be legitimate 3Ah 15A drain cells. Anyways thought id let everyone know and the sales ends on Sept 9 at 9pm CTZ.

That's not bad actually. That's a £2 saving per cell over Nkon, plus Nkon you have to pay shipping on top of that. Obviously the more you buy the cheaper the shipping gets, but on BG slightly quicker shipping is only £0.85 more... Not a bad deal :thumbsup:

Yeah but shipping is €30 so unless your ordering a bunch of cells it doesn't make sense for a US buyer.
