Is it possible to set a max rpm when using FOC mode on the VESC? 

In BLDC-tool under RPM limits it says BLDC only, but in the Nunchuck application there is something about ERPM limit start/end, what is the difference?

@chibby Yes, if you are using FOC you can limit RPM in either controller app that you are using, PPM or Nunchuck. The ERPM is a threshold at which RPM\speed will begin to be limited by VESC, so "Start " is RPM threshold where acceleration will be controlled, and "End" is the absolute max RPM.
