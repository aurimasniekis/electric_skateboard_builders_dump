A week ago, while riding home, I got thrown off my board for the same reason I did the first time. Luckily, there was no one around and I didn't really get injured, but since it was 2am, and I didn't trust the board, I just ran my ass home (wasn't far).

I already knew what the issue was as soon as it happened. The receiver was physically disconnected from the VESC and that gave the motor a stutter, wasn't exactly full brake, throwing me off balance. The failsafe for when the remote is turned off while the board is on works fine. I turn off my remote while leaving the board on all the time.

This happened with a HobbyWing ESC over a year ago as well.
Is there some kind of failsafe for when the receiver is physically disconnected?

secure the ppm wires so they don't come loose and get disconnected.

It's not like I haven't got it secured. I have the ppm wires zip-tied to the receiver and the other side is soldered to the VESC.
It's just those moments when they, for whatever reason, want to fail on you.
