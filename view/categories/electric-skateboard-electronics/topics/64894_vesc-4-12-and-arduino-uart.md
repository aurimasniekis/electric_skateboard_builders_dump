Does anyone have a working arduino library with UART on vesc 4.12?

Currently I have connected BT module and applications on android - it works well. (9600 baud)

Now I wanted to connect through arduino ... I found something like:
https://github.com/R0b0shack/VESC-UART-Arduino

uploaded, connected LCD, baud 115200, uart + ppm and nothing ... does not download data from uart.
I use arduino Uno and vesc 4.12

HW is too old?

Hardware doesnâ€™t matter in this case

Try this one from @Pimousse
