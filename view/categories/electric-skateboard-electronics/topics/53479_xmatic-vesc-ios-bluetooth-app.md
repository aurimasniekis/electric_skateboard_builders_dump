If your goal is learning software skills, one of the biggest mistakes you can make is building stuff that only works on one brand of phone.  As a business, this costs a bunch of money and can sink you later.  Try looking at something like ReactNative

I'm not angry.  I'm just rolling my eyes because he's drinking the Kool-Aid.  People have to learn to think for themselves and remove the fog of what people want them to think (so they can make more money because of you)

There's nothing wrong with starting out with Native Programming (to this I refer to respective languages compiled & used for said development)  and then working towards software that allows you to code in both at the same time, if anything, it'll allow you to understand what you're working with better than if you didn't have an understanding of Swift and Android. Not to mention that his next project, which would probably be porting to android, will give him a better foundation in Java, Swift, and general programming as he compares and contrast the difference between the two and how both Languages change his perspective on effective practices, and programming as a whole.

As a independent he's better building his profile , like this and then going to ReactNative,  rather than telling him that doing this is a mistake.

@b264  yess I was planning to learn react native but i decided to do native programing first before trying to move to react native. I will learn react for my next app whatever it might be. 

@Jc06505n  mhmm! thats like my thought process of getting into these types of programing, wanted ease into it and learn some native before going full react as some people suggested. Im not a CS major so I'm just learning piece by piece. 

@Scoo_B_SK8 haha yess! first go at iOS, thank you! that means a lot. I just need to learn more about UI stuff, got no experience in that department!  Take the leap! You won't regret it.  I used to play games in my spare times but now I just programing. Programming for fun is very interesting, never understood why people did it until now.

@gee yep swift and C

@myreala I'm not sure yet. I want to put it out into the app store so I will charge like a buck or two to get the developer fee back :] which isn't much. Then probably open source it to gain improvements, didn't think too much about it.

Looks nice. What I miss are the top and bottom values when reached next to the real time values. Not sure how to explain that better. 
Eskate VESC app does this well. 
The metr app is also missing this. 

I use both these apps on iOS and I like the eSkate VESC app better for this reason only.

Hi @twan ! Looks awesome! I'm still very new to this world of esk8ing but I've been playing around with a loaner board that has the METR module in it and my favourite part about the whole mobile thing is that the METR app has apple watch support :) I just find it's so much easier to look at the watch than to pull out my phone. I was wondering if it's something you have considered

Nice , something ackamic and METR lacks in terms of their apps is overall design persay . This looks closer to the other app everyone was excited for but the guy got to busy with. The icons look blurry though, probably just compression. Are you ensuring that there are PNG’s for all screen sizes ?

Edit: I was viewing on a monitor , on phone the icons look awesome

Yes I have considered doing the Apple watch. I probably will work on it after I finalized the current app and add that on. Also planning on maybe adding a future global stats where users can register and submit their overall stats and this will allow users to compare to other people world wide.

-"Esk8ers near me"  (GPS enabled + registered user /map {only while another rider is out  riding}).
-"Places to SK8 near me" (GPS map of known "good" places to ride).

just tossing it out there.. 

Im just excited to see what you already got for release.  I'll certainly be adding it to my repertoire. :wink:

That is great, looking forward to it! One small detail to keep in mind when you get to that stage, the METR app while it does have support for Apple watch does not have an icon you can assign to the watch face. How awesome would it be to be able to assign different stats to different icons of a watch face, have battery in one corner, it can be similar to the way apple watch displays its own battery, speed in mph/km/h in another icon, watt/h in the center etc. Basically allow most stats to be assigned to different watch face icons. Take care and good luck!

@egzplicit yeah! I can include that, its on the status tab but I can get an icon and put it on the dashboard. 

 @Ebisane9 yes, the profile function is working great! and it uses the HM-10 Modules.

I am running VESC 4 at 2.18 software so that may be the issue...

Just tried your app for a 10 km ride. Works great. 
I’m running 3.1 on iphone 7. 

On the stats page it doesn’t display the distance. It reads zero. On the home screen it works fine. 

The recording is fine but it doesn’t show a graph like I'm used to like metr or eskate vesc. 

Looking forward to your improvements. I really like the app so far. Keep up the good work.

@twan it’s awesome! Looks great and works really well. I can’t wait for an update. The few issues I’m having will likely be fixed when you’ve  updated for older firmware. Also, just to mention, the battery percentage indicator seems to think my board is 10s but it’s actualy 12s, (and yes I set up the battery info) Will this also be updated? I figure this version of the app is just a basic beta concept and probably works awesome already for your own set up. Again great job! Everything is perfect, only add I would recommend is wh/mile. Just a suggestion though. Keep up the awesome work! Thank you!

@Jaeson thanks for the status update it really helps! Regarding the battery it should be working fine, try the new update build ver 7. I updated the readings so it should work for fw 2.18 and ack firmwares. However; for profile configs that has not been updated yet. and yes i will for sure add wh/mile, thats a g great idea!

@Scoo_B_SK8 it should work on your ack 3.101 now! test it out.   

@dg798 for now just the readings of stats are available, i will add support for profile writes and read soon!

@Mikenopolis great idea! I will work to add that on the future too, if you click the person icon on the dashboard that will be where it will go to allow you to select which board and store life time stats for the board. 

@Kug3lis hmm thats weird, try reinstalling and/or getting closer to your board that might fix it.

Welll I was being kinda dumb and programmed it in a way that it would poll the vesc for data every x amount of time but the flaw in that logic was that depending on factors such as phone/ble module/vesc etc.. It processed the data at different rates and by having a set time to poll, it screwed up my processing code where it actually processes the data packets and overflow the buffer so it crashes. 

I simply reverted to event based that would wait for the response is OK before sending another packet. I had this method before but it screwed something up but I fixed that problem. 

Pretty dumb LOL.

@anorak234 hmm im not familiar with the vesc6 but if it uses the same 2.18 firmware then I don't see why it wouldn't work. Watch support will be added a bit later on, but I will get there.

@twan, been testing the app on my new [LaCroix](https://www.lacroixboards.com/product-page/dss60) board and I loooove it! One thing, like other mentioned it would be sweet to have an "odometer", total number of kms done with the board. 

And one really cool thing if it's possible... Make an audio alert when the charge hits 90% or 95% when charging. I want to get the most of my batteries and I don't want to charge them all the way to the top and I find myself always looking at the app. If I could get a notification it would be really cool. I was thinking how awesome would it be to use IFTTT with a smart plug, and when your app gives a notification, the smart plug turns off and stops the charge. I'll spell it out, it would be P-E-R-F-E-C-T :D 

It would be nice even for people who charge it 100% and leave it overnight but want to minimize the risk of a fire :D , app sends notification, smartplug shuts off. 

I'm not aware what a developper needs to do to get the app working with IFTTT though, just wishful thinking.

Once again, you've done a great job on the app!

EDIT: I'm running FW2.18 definetly looking forward for full support as well :)

Hey. I‘m also testing your App and it is really cool so far :blush: I found a few bugs, though. If I try to upload VESC settings it does not work, which is fine as the App is in development and this feature does not work, yet. But if I try it, there is a loading circle which rotates but I can’t stop it or switch the menus. So I have to force quit the app and restart it. 

Thanks so far for the work and time you put in there :slight_smile:

I know it's quite clearly spelt out in the title "w/ HM-10", but I've not been able to connect this app to my [nrf51](https://github.com/vedderb/nrf51_vesc). It's just another BLTE device and uses the same serial/VESC communication protocol so I can't imagine it'd be a lot of work to support; more just that you may be filtering out devices that aren't HM-10s (?) Right now I see no Bluetooth devices when scanning.

The nrf51 allows you to connect straight to the VESC Tool, and supports a higher baud rate (115200). It's quite nice being able to do wireless firmware updates/etc.

Usually when this happens it means the app connected to the Bluetooth properly but the Bluetooth module could not communicate with the vesc usually caused by different baud rate between vesc and Bluetooth module.

Sweet! Maybe the ability to evaluate battery life through time ? Charge cycles ? 

- Or something like notes/logs every 250km or so(or at custom interval. Where you can save current battery lifetime, current stats - a bit like when you take your car for an oil change, at 1200km - battery life was X % , you had ridden board for X hours, and had X charge cycles.

The app could evaluate riding style through GPS and accelerometer data and give out points based on that. Think of a snowboarding videogame like example. For instance you could divide trophy points into 3 different categories - Carver, Speed Demon, Explorer. 

**Carver** - users would get points based on carving stats, g-force, speed, etc. **EDIT** variable would act as multipliers - think NFS drift mode - lenght of carving streak * speed at which user carves * width of carve * aggressiveness of turn initiation  

**Speed Demon** - pretty straight forward, speed is the word. (0-30mph accelerations, straight speed runs, etc)

**Explorer** - trophy points are awarded for long distance runs and total distance travelled milestones.

It could have something like the rings on the apple watch with daily goals and completion status.

Community opportunity for users to appropriate themselves to a particular riding style. Room for events and bonus features on given days or locations.

Cheers!

## \#160 Posted by: twan Posted at: 2018-05-30T18:21:44.544Z Reads: 228

Pretty simple, just connect the pins on the bluetooth module to the pins on the vesc.
BLE GND - VESC GND
BLE VCC - VESC 5V
BLE TX - VESC RX
BLE RX - VESC TX

Set Baud Rate of UART via BLDC tool to 9600
Set App Config to PPM + UART via BLDC tool

Although it sounds like you are on a older firmware, I suggest you upgrade to vedders 3.38 version or acks 3.101 fw versions, newer firmware are more streamlined. Its the same process via the new VESC Tool.

Hi everyone I have my HM-10 module all soldered up per the layout that Scoo_B_SK8 shared. I am running dual sensor motors on FocBox with can bus mater slave.  The questions I have are the following:

1) Do I plug into master UART port?
2) How do I connect the HM-10 in Ack? Do I need to have USB hooking into Master?
3)  Any other special settings for dual data to appear on iOS App?

I can’t speak for @Ebisane9 but i’m sticking to 3.1 because it has been out longer and therefore tested by more people. 

3.101 is pretty new and speaking from experience I rather not update until the later release has been proven more to be reliable. 

I have already read a few posts from people whom have upgraded already from 3.1 to 3.101 and the experience of the ride was different with the same settings they had previously with the 3.1 release. 
This already is a good enough reason for me to stick to 3.1. 

I am happy how my board performs with 3.1 and don’t yet wish to mess with it. Until 3.101 has been proven to be more reliable I will wait to update to it.
It does include some critical bug fixes so I really do wish to update to this version.

An auto on-auto off option would be cool for recording rides. I either forget to press start or press stop most of the time. Say if motors spin at over 5km/h for 3 seconds it starts recording, if they stop for more than 5 seconds it PAUSES and if they don't start again in the next 5 minutes it stops the ride recording.

Would there by any way to have the tracking pause when your board gets shut off, that would be great!

@twan first thx for your work. got my HM10 Modul yesterday and everything works out well so far.
Just for my own interest, how you calculate the battery percentage?
Doesn´t it depend on the cut off set in the VESC? Or you get this data from the VESC? (Sorry if it´s stupid question, I´m new in this topics).

Further I would like to ask if it´s possible to implement a rotation in the app. I mean, if to turn the app in horizontal position, the app turns too.
I really would like to mount my phone on the front of my trampa board and get a real time speedometer... ;) there is no way to get a full screen speed display as additional page?:sweat_smile::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Hey, @twan, great app! I've been beta-testing it on my Raptor 2 and I have some feedback/questions:
- The battery percentage doesn't display, but the volts do. Can this be added?
- To program a riding mode, do I just manually enter the values and write it? For example, could I just enter the values from one of ACKAMANIAC's modes?
- Are you still hoping to add support for 2.80?
- Is the app called eSk8matics or Telematics?

Thank you!

Hey! thank you :)  and yes you can just enter whatever you want and it will write it. I will add fw 2.80 support later I forgot/busy. For now it's called telematics on the app icon but my image says esk8matics haha sorry for the confusion , I will fix that .

@pjotr47 I might add it online in the future as I get more time on my hands.  For writing wise if you upgrade to the newer version firmware the write will work. I'm not sure why the writes are not working for older versions , I tried to debug it but haven't found the problem.  If yo I are like on ack 3.1 and above or vesc 3.34 and above the writes will work for sure.

@Twan - so I 've downloaded your app and it seems like a great app. I'll be buying full version for sure...but I have some problems with getting the right numbers for my battery and my motor. 

So I have 10s4p battery with LGHG2 cells. The app displays voltage correctly - it's the same number as my voltage meter shows...but in my HOME tab - the amount of precentage % that the app shows is totally wrong. 
My voltage meter shows I have 40% left while the app shows I have 56% left . So not sure why.

As for my motor - I have CARVON v2.5 single hub motor and when bench testing it shows the speed of 28mph max ...but with my 10s4p battery I think the speed should be lower..close to 24mph.

@NAF the battery % is based on the cell voltage from 4.2 - 2.9 volts using 30q discharge graph. I need to add a custom voltage thing to it later.

Regarding wheel speed are carvon 12 poles? And not 14?

Oh I just realized my BLE dongle is NRF51 based (see: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-ios-bluetooth-app/53479/129?u=careyer). It would be awesome if it could be supported. I think that many people are prone to buy this FlipSky stuff together with their VESCs just as I did.

Would it be possible for the trip recording to capture more of the stats over the entirety of the trip? 
Perhaps I just don't know how to access it.

It would be cool if i could go in to a trip and drag my finger along the recorded mapped line. If for example I knew there was a big hill in a particular spot, I could see how much my motors were drawing up the hill, what temperature my ESC was at a particular moment or how much regen I was able to generate from that hill. 

side question, where is the elevation and wind data drawing from? Is this getting pulled from Google Map data?

Hello. I bought the app and bought  a hm-10 Bluetooth chip from amazon, the Dsd tech. I have a Flipsky 6.6 vesc with updates firmware. The app finds the Bluetooth module but it does not get any data from the board. Am I missing something? Thank you

Try swapping TX/RX. RX goes into TX and TX goes into RX (one side sends and another receives)

Is your vesc enabled for PPM+UART? and baudrate set for 9600?

Try what @Kug3lis said. 

When it's green it means the app has connected to the Bluetooth successfully and if it says nothing it means vesc and the app aren't talking, most likely the vesc uart is not enabled.

Yesterday I downloaded your app. It first didn`t work but when I uploaded a motor setting mode, it started to load all the real time data. Everything woks fine now and it looks really good I think!

There is one feature that would be really usefull for me:
When writing App settings, I want them to be reverted to my "default" settings whenever I turn the board off and on again. This is implemented in Ackmaniacs app (see [this documentation](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-monitor-android-app/20888) under "mode box"). I know you design your app to work both with normal and ack firmware and this feature would probably not work without ack. (or would it? :thinking:)

This feature would be great since I want to have a street-legal mode whenever I turn on the board. (.. because of german laws :roll_eyes:)

Other than that, I really enjoy the app so far!

Oh... so is it possible to save certain things on the board like odometer? I really like that Boosted has a odometer and doesn’t require connecting to an app to track how far you’ve ridden your board.

No it's not possible. It's how the vesc is programed unfortunately. But the app does track total mileage if you track your trips.

I plugged the HM-10 into the master vesc, and I set the slave ID like this. This is good for CAN forwarding am I right?

Ok. So I’m playing around with it. Trying to set the erpm to 10k to make sure both motors receive the desired configs before setting the actual values. Sometimes it failed to write, and other times only the slave receives the config. Is this expected?

Edit: so apparently I was misunderstanding CAN forwarding. I thought it’d “sync” across the two vescs. You have to toggle the switch OFF to send configs to the master, then toggle it ON to “CAN forward” to the slave. @twan am I right?

Absolutely loving the app, by far the best one on iOS. And the FAQ is a godsend.

I'm using it on my raptor 2 and I already logged in around 50km before using your app, can I enter that data myself so that it doesn't start from 0?

And also, I'd love to create an outline for my raptor 2 to add to your outlines list and send it to you if that's possible, and I was thinking if I also could do most common deck shapes (loaded vanguard, evo, switchblade etc) if you're interested.

Yes! if you want to create some outlines and send em to me I can add it to the app. 
I think its not working 100% correctly because the raptor is on firmware 2.80 I believe and I havent added support for that firmware yet. I will add support for this in the next firmware since there are quite a few raptor 2 owners out there.

Hi Guys
I have a iPhone and installed Xmatic. It’s great but:
1. There is a problem in the duration. It is always more than the actual ride (like 20% more). It’s a bit frustrating. Anybody know why / how to resolve this? 
2. I am not sure what the average speed means. Is it the average speed when on movement only? Because it is definitively not the overall average speed (it does not reconcile with the duration and the length of the ride). 
Thanks all and Tuan for your insights!
Cheers

@twan A complication is just a widget on the face of the Apple Watch. So any of the widget-like functionality in the 4 corners of the watch face; The date display on the watch face; or any of the quick-access links on the watch face. These are all called complications.

As far as I can tell, there isn't a complication for Xmatic. It seems like Apple allows developers to opt into super functional complications/widgets, that have extended quick glance functionality (like the weather app I use is always updating and displaying the current temperature) . Or, you can opt into the basic functionality, which is just a quick link that you can add to the face of your watch. 

All I'd like to see is just the quick link style complication/widget added, just so I can quickly open Xmatic from my watch face.

Twan, First I would like to say THANK YOU for developing this awesome app!   It’s a must have have for most of us.  Game changer for sure.  

I could use some help.  I have a Laxroix with the focbox vesc.  I had no problems connecting it to your app a couple months back and it worked flawlessly for the past two months.  Then about two weeks ago it started to only partially connect, only showing my “esc temperate” and never fully connecting to my Bluetooth, under status it just keeps flashing  “connecting to Bluetooth”.   So the battery/voltage and speeds are not registering.  In My phone settings under the Bluetooth it shows “connected”.   What’s strange is that it started working again for about a day or two but now I’m back to not getting it to connect. 

I’ve tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling a few times.  I’ve tried turning on and off my Bluetooth.  I’ve tried going into your apps settings under Bluetooth and selecting MLT-BT05.   

Any suggestions sir?    I’ll attach a few screen shots and video.   Thanks a whole bunch for your time!!

Darn, hearing these problems and can't figure out the problems make me angry I want to make the app work smoothly for everyone but seems like there's something going on that I will have to take deep look into. I will spend this weekend and do this. 

Make sure your Bluetooth wire is fully connected too, over time vibrations might break the solder joint on the modules.  -> also double check can fwd is not on.

What FW versions are you guys running @ualsteve94 @Rod12579

Hi Twan,
I also have a Lacroix and the FW is version 2.18. 
Let me post some pictures to give context / data:
![image|281x499](upload://kkECYeaI6OVOXXZKLh2E0DMl1pZ.jpeg) 

1. As you can see , the timing on Xmatic app is too much. It should show 53 minutes but I don’t know why the timing on Xmatic is always too much (in this case 1h10minutes). (FYI, speed and distance Source is from Motor). 
2. How do you calculate the average speed? If I do the math, then 1h10 ride for 15km doesn’t give me 19km/h in average. 
3. The temperature shows -273.2degrees. How is that possible?
4. How do you calculate the elevation and the wind? 

Thanks a lot!! This is a great app,
Cheers
Olivier

[/quote]

I think I can answer some of these questions after a few weeks of using the app. 

2. You need to set your gear ratio in Settings >> Gearing so it can calculate the speed accurately. 
3. That temperature is when you launch the app without an internet connection, it’s just weather data using your current location. 
4. Same thing as above.

Btw, why is the FW version so low? I thought most people run at 3.xx

Anyone having issues with setting up speed modes. I’ve tried to make a slow mode for when friends try my board, however I can’t get the speed to be limited.

@twan 
hey man. I bought this HM-10 module but it turns out the be a clone. It has the cc41-A instead of the HM-10 chip. I know it works because I can detect it on my phone. But the when I send the AT command it doesn't send back the OK. I was wondering if your app work with it. I tried it before and you told me to set the baud rate to 9600 but the module came with 9600 baud rate. 
So before I buy the app, can you let me know if I can get it to work. 
I would really appreciate it if anyone can help me flash the HM-10 onto this cc41-a chip.

EDIT:
I somehow got it working but the app that I have called _**Serial**_ does detect the module. However, I install another electric skateboard app called _**Board Remote**_ from iPhone app store and it doesn't detect it. This is the list of commands I got. I don't know why the **_Board Remote_** doesn't detect the module but the _**Serial**_ does. So I was hoping if you can help me.

@twan I just upgraded to the iPhone XR, and now the app gets stuck on “connecting to vesc” instead of running like it did on my 6. Is it possibly because the app hasn’t been updated to work with the new phones yet? Is there another way to possibly solve this issue? Thanks

Also if you have a dual vesc, You have to write to the master and slave separately. You can enable can bus in the settings.

Hold your thumb down or any other digit on the mode you wish to apply. 
Now move said digit to the right to apply. 

You can also use your nose but it will be harder to do if you even face.

So next question is: i have a benchwheel remote.  When i go to "hi" mode and give it some juice the board just dies.  I'm guessing it's giving it too many amps it it kills the motor based on my VESC settings.  I suppose i need to tweak my settings a bit more.

What fw version are you running? And are you sure your baud rates are correct and UART is enabled? If it says Connecting to VESC it means it successfully connect to the  Bluetooth module however its having trouble talking to the vesc >>> this means the baud rates are wrong or UART data is not being sent from the vesc.

Hey @twan , for some reason the app seems to always be off on battery percentage. I have a 12s1p Lipo set up. Any idea why the percentage seems to be off by 5-10%? The app seems to think that my battery is at 100% charged at 50.1 volts when it’s actually full at 50.5 or 50.6. Is there a way to change the max charge volts so it knows how full my battery actually is?

I use my android phone with other app and it works great! Have turn it off ... restart the board.. .and nothing shows on Xmatic...

I can’t tell what the comments above are for (or what those fixes are for). I still can’t connect my unity and iOS. 

I did, however, test what @twan asked for a few weeks back and plugged in my HM-10 module into the UART and as expected it works and is pulling Vesc info

@Jaydawg56 I figured, looks like it will work if you connect a HM10 on the UART port. However the app will not work with the built in Bluetooth that Unity has.. Will have to look into how to make that work.

So for those who want the app to work for now, just plug your HM10 into the UART port on Unity.

What is the easiest way to switch between the two boards (I assume picking the right module under BT settings)?

As for switching between board you would just have to change which BT module in the settings. It shouldn't be wiping out ride history if you change bt in settings

@twan @kiryl 
First of all thanks for the absolutely amazing app! This is the best bluetooth app I have seen yet!
I cant wait for support for the FOCBOX UNITY. I too just like @kiryl Would love to have support for the Unity and wouldn't mind doing any beta testing for ya if you need help! 

Love the work you've done, keep it up!

Motor should be pretty acurate.

Did you go full on the throttle unloaded after you started your ride?

Hello,
I have tried to read on this thread but I can’t find the information I’m looking for. I want an app that works with my Raptor 2.1, if possible also my Evolve GTX. What do I need to do to make this happened? Do I need to add some module on the board or does the app work “out of the box”

Incoming Update ~ weekout or so, hard to find free time

- Xmatic is now fully compatible with Unity's built in Bluetooth.
- This means Raptor 2.1 / Unity users can use Xmatic without any modifications (no need for HM10 modules or having to mess with settings)
- Multi-board support (no need to change settings when connecting to a different board, each board can have its own settings)
- Reworked bluetooth so your app wont connect to the wrong board if there are multiple users around
- Fixed lipo battery curve & added custom battery curve
- FW 3.51 support
- Some bug fixes and optimizations


Sorry for the slow progress but its progress haha!

Hey man, just saw another thread in which you said your holding the update up due to unity not connecting, but since they can still use an HM-10 module and the rest of us using your app started with an HM-10 module and would like other features like a correct battery curve, Do you think you could push that update with what you do have working? I appreciate the work you do, but personally I’ve asked for a lipo curve and you told me 3 updates and many months ago that the lipo curve would be added. Please man? I’ve been using the app since beta and love it, paid for it when it came out and it still didn’t quite work right, now it’s soooo close! Please push the update if possible? @twan

I'm having a similar issue as @PickSix24 with Unity. I do get telemetry for a few secs but then it stops working. It's not like the app freezes. The elapsed time keeps going. It's more like the app cannot read more data from the Unity. Also, when I switch the Unity off, the app correctly reports that the connection has been lost. When I turn it on again, the app reconnects and can read the telemetry again, but only for a few secs.

Oh this totally describes my issue as well. I thought it was some time out thing that detected when the motors are spinning but the gps registers no movement. Basically I only notice it when bench testing. My phone goes in my bag when I ride. But during bench testing I get speed data from the unity for a couple minutes then nothing... if this is also happening when I ride it explains the weird max speed data.

To be clear, it wasn’t a criticism of the app, just a suggested feature which might improve the user experience. Some of us aren’t glued to our devices, but might like to occasionally glance over our riding stats. Things like the “lifetime” stats which are a available by clicking on the profile in the top right of the screen - it would be really cool if these were somehow automatically captured. You only need to forget to log one trip and the stats become kinda irrelevant.

Maybe try the old school method of tying a string to your finger to remind you to hit start and stop. I’m also not glued to my device, but somehow I remember to hit start and stop every time I ride. I like to call it discipline. Like always putting my keys in the same place so as to not misplace them 👍🏻.... btw no offense, I’m just messing with you. @twan is the man and in most cases does his best to make the app as user friendly as he can.

There's a feature that auto starts logging your trip....

Also you cannot write stats to unity because of iOS limitation with the current firmware on the built in Bluetooth 

No it can't mess up your unity since the app has safe checks before writing anything to the unity

Hey @twan,

I'm wondering If you every heard of this issue: In very rare occasions when I fully push the throttle (quickly), my Vesc seems to change to some kind of 'beast' mode :joy: with no speed and (presumably) no amp draw restrictions.

Then it stay's that way until I change settings trough the app or turn the Vesc off and on (not sure about the last one). Definitely not saying that Xmatic has anything to do with it but the way I see it, it can only be the Vesc itself (Foxbox) or the app (since it only happend when the app was on, but then it only happens ever to rarely).

Just wanted to know if someone ever heard of such an issue?
Specs:
Vesc: Foxbox
Firmware: Ackmaniac but had same issue before using Ackmaniac firmware
Remote: Miniremote
Phone: iPhone 6s iOS 12.2

Oh and another (very small) bug: When you set your battery max in the app lower than the actual battery level, the battery symbol on the main page shows empty.
This happens when I charge the battery to 41,5V but 100% is set to 41V. Because after a few minutes it drops back to 41V.

Thanks, any help is appreciated!

Ah... awesome! So that’s what auto logging is, duh 🙄

There’s a couple of extra things in settings which are pretty cool. I have it set to get speed data from the motors and distance from gps.

Tell me, for the unity should I have double data for dual config selected?

@twan I installed the latest Xmatic update with the Unity fix. Was that supposed to address what I described [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/xmatic-vesc-ios-bluetooth-app/53479/646?u=janpom)? There seems to be some improvement. The app keeps the connection to the Unity longer but it still freezes after a minute or two.

Is there anything I can do to help you debug the issue? I'm a software engineer and I have experience with communicating to VESC from my DAVEga project. I have successfully implemented Unity support there.

Could the problem be that you poll the VESC too frequently? From my experience, if you don't allow enough delay between requests, the VESC starts sending invalid messages as a response. Or maybe you accidentally do CAN FWD requests, which you shouldn't do on the Unity?

@janpom it's more of a Bluetooth issue. If it's on the hm10 it'll be fine and won't DC but for the on board module It'll DC after a bit. If it's faster poll it DC's faster and the slower the polling the longer it stays connected. 

@Ruubie200 no it does not. No such function on the vesc. It would have to be built into the BMS.

Makes sense. How about adding a config option for the polling frequency? I personally don't use real-time data. I just want data logging. If I could set the polling freq to /1s and that would prevent the disconnect issue I would be happy.

I love it. 

I have a feature request if you’re still creating updates!

On my ESC the voltage reading randomly oscillates +/- about 0.6 volts. I know others have the same issue depending on the manufacture. 
Can you add an option to smooth out the voltage reading with about a 1 sec average?
I think that would greatly stabilize the number and improve viewing the app while riding to check battery voltage. 

Awesome work!!

Hey @twan for some reason when I go on longer rides, the app freezes up. It’s not keeping stats when it freezes. When I close out of the app and come back in, the home page keeps my distance, and power usage, but everything else resets. Any idea what’s wrong? It didn’t do this before.

BTW, I don’t have a unity, Tb vesc running 3.34

Same here. @twan, when looking at the live data, I can see that the reduced polling works correctly. The live data refresh rate is reduced. However, this unfortunately doesn't resolve the "freezing" issue on Unity. I also tested the Xmatic on my other board with ESCapes and the Metr module and I cannot reproduce the problem there. Apparently this is specific either to Unity FW or to the BT module it uses. Actually, let me test with Unity and Metr and see if that's any different.
```

@twan, so I tested the Unity both with the built-in BT module and with the Metr module. It only freezes with the built-in one. I can consistently reproduce the freezing. It takes anything between 1 and 30 seconds after establishing the connection. With Metr, even after several minutes, everything was still working flawlessly. I tried switching between the built-in BT and Metr a few times and I'm confident the built-in BT is the culprit of the freezing.

Apparently, both restarting Unity or restarting Xmatic resolves the freezing. It looks as thought the BT connection needs to be re-established for things to continue working normally. I hope this will help you to figure it out. Let me know if you need more input.

Good catch. What @IDVert3X describes in the thread is exactly the same symptoms. @twan, any chance to implement the same kind of workaround that @Deodand has done in the official Unity app? I guess that's detecting a dropped BT connection and reconnect.

Hi @twan thank you for your app. Your app rocks!

But there are some bugs that is discovered:

1. When i open my saved trip, it opens with strange offset:

 ![IMG_0831|281x499](upload://eVoXNJl4mOMnlqlEAthZQuWAfHF.png) 

2. I use iphone 6. So when i open antoher app, xmatic can offten stop tracking at all, and lost all info about track. Also when app crashed sometimes it also not saves track, and there no resume option.

For my bicycle riding i use Strava to track my route. Please check their app, they handle great stop and resume action, while app chrashed.

Feature suggest:

1. Do you have backend to store all trips? It looks like no, cause I lost all my trips while upgrade app. 
2. Share function will be great. Check how strava shares trips, for example for instagram. It renders nice pic with stats that you can share in you IG.


Do you plan to develop backend?

Hi, first of all amazing app!
But I found a smal bug/problem.
Background information: I am using the motor turns to calculate the distance.
If you turn off your board after a ride and turn it back on your distance is back to 0km. I think this is because the just vesc is saving the TAC ABS. Maybe saving that data also in the App and then addig them together.

All of a sudden today my Unity (FW 23.44) with stock BT (First batch 1.1) module now gets stuck on "Connecting to Vesc" in Xmatic app. Had been working before.  In the Xmatic bluetooth settings I can connect to the Unity BT module just fine, but it doesn't show the telemetry data anymore. I sent my debug log via the Xmatic app. Rebooted my phone (iOS) and re-installed the app. I doubt that this has anything to do with the communication between the phone and the Unity BT, but instead the BT module not being able to communicate with Unity.

Ripped open my enclosure and stuck an old HM-10 module in there and works fine. 🤔

@Deodand is it possible that the voltage spikes are frying the Unity BT modules? No communication between the (first batch) SKB369 nRF52 module and Unity via RX/TX due to something being fried?

I'd buy a new SKB369 module and replace the old one by soldering it on the BT PCB, but since the stock one is (probably) loaded with custom firmware I doubt it would be of any use, since starting to program my own NRF modules is not something I'm looking forward to. Starting to consider buying a Metr Unity module, but worried my Unity will fry that too.

Not sure anymore in which thread to post this, Xmatic or Unity troubleshooting. Posting in both.
Also made an Enertion support ticket.

Can confirm - fw 3.58 doesn't like the Mode writes. (Dual FSESC 4.20 Plus)

sorry guys! havent had time to work on the app, will try to get the update out for 3.58 since many are updating to that one. 

@Stan8 it should work, some people said it does anyways. I cant confirm my self since I do not have one but the flipsky is based off nrf51 so it should work.

Update is pushed, (will take a bit before it shows on app store) it will support up to the latest fw 3.58. also a possible fix for unity (not sure because I do not own a unity to test currently) . Finally had time to sit down and do some coding this weekend, thanks all ~ :D

As I've had Unity since 1st batch got shipped and had bluetooth issues with the darn thing since day one, fried my bluetooth module and got a replacement, that still doesn't really work; I'm just happy I can finally track/record my rides and monitor data. I'll happily take the 3 second reconnect  over having no reconnects at all. Thanks again for the update. :slight_smile: 

Still waiting for Enertion to fix their bluetooth issues.

I have just downloaded you app, it's great! But I was wondering if there was a way for the app to stay permanently on the apple watch without it fading away?
For me, when I lay down my watch, after a few minutes, the screen just goes away and it goes to my clock. So I have to reload it every time, and it takes a few seconds to have the data just showing there.

I figured that out but thank you! Lol 😝 I am actually having trouble connecting it. My remote is on UART and idk if that is impacting it. I plug it in and I can see the Bluetooth on my iPhone Bluetooth setting and see it in my app but at the bottom of the telem page it says connecting and never connects. I am on VESC6 running 3.58 update. When I adjust the buad rate then my remote seems not to work.. idk what I am doing wrong? I tried following the FAQ and I still can’t get it. But the Bluetooth module is working I just can’t seem to get it to connect to the app. Please help @twan

In settings for your you can actually change the time an app stays active, you do however have to set the watch to not turn on when you lift your wrist, sucks but works around!

What I am waiting for is a Complication, that would be the true "always on" haha. :)

I’m actually having a weird issue that I might’ve narrowed down from reading the topic. Currently on latest Unity firmware and I am having issues with data being recorded. Either I can’t save any data or the data is missing a lot of ride information like gps path and sometimes all data. I uninstalled thinking that might’ve solved the issue so all I got is a small snap of two of the rides it did record. ![image|231x500](upload://sd6zW0NgUH4WyMYLSF9ombsQkmi.jpeg)

@Stan8 the app isnt updated to support 3.62 yet, ill update the app once I get some free time.

So I have a unity running 23.46 fw and it connects and works great for everything except writing modes. I can create modes I just can’t apply them onto the Vesc. Xmatic gives me a notification that says firmware 23.46 isn’t supported. Anyway to fix that or perhaps include that in a future update? Thanks.

First,  thanks @twan for the App.  I've been using it to track battery usage and as my speedometer for 30 miles of commute each day.    it's been great. :) 

Second. Anyone know what NO_FAULT_CODE means?   

![image|281x499](upload://wASQNLMVojaANDBdp7GS7UxCMWI.jpeg) 

I can't find anything related to it in BLDC code.  It just triggered with my board on the bench. and the board has no faults as read from vesc-tool terminal.    it also appears to have disconnected and won't reconnect.   wondering if the meaning of that code will provide any clue.

connected via HM-10  to focbox running 3.63 firmware. xmatic version 1.54

update:   Xmatic did eventually reconnect 6 minutes later according to the log.   phone was sitting 1ft away from the receiver the whole time.  still wondering what the "NO_FAULT_CODE" means.
