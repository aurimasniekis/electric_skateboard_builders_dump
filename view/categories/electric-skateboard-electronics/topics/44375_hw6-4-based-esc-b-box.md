So whats the legal situation on making these are they open source or not?

I did  some research/math and for 500 of them the costs are for BOM 27000$, assembly 3000$, PCB 2500$, Aluminum Case $4000 Wires and connectors $2500.
All in all about 39000$ about 78$ per controller.
While I would have to talk to my wife before taking such a large amount out of savings the return seems rather quick and plentiful.
Considering most Direktfets are sold out until the middle of the year I  doubt  all those focboxes people ordered will ship soon...and the Bom for 500 is in my cart waiting 100% stocked.
E-teknet in AZ say they can have them done in 10 days after receiving all parts.
And 3d hubs can have the housings  done and shipped next week.

Lets say I would sell these at  a moderate 130$ + tax(5.6%)=137$ I am pretty sure they'd sell out in a month.

Cheaper than a Focbox and made in the USA.

To gather for People not wanting to weed through the whole thing.

I am making 50 Hw6.4 clones designed by @stewii, they will come with a Cover PCB a plastic body and an Aluminum Heat sink.
I am in the phase of the project where all parts are ordered.

You know, the math sounds good. My concern is when for what ever reason there is an issue during the process and your left with 500 paper weights that need more investment to get them to a reliable and more importantly, sellable state.  Not that this would happen, but it could.  And asking the wife for more out of our savings to fix something like that seems... dangerous? 

But on another note, freaking do it, I'll buy some.

I would start with 50 or less to make sure everything is sound, give them a few months, see if they hold up or if you have complaints coming in from customers. If all is well place your order for 500 and you'll already have made about $2600 in the process which will offset some of that huge initial cost.

The Boards seem sound so far and I will be testing them more. Considering I hand soldered them and they are running  and running in foc at 245KV  and 260KV  at 12s 3 battery charges so far everything that toasted my 4.12over and over. I will order an initial 10 from the factory and give  them to friends to test. But 500 seems to be the sweet spot between availability, risk and earning. Sadly the normal Mosfets  are  sold out so I'll have to use Automotive ones that can dissipate about 200w more heat but also cost about 33% more.

Those would probably be preferable anyway. I would buy your product over Trampa's knowing you're using better FETs, since those can cause some of the worst problems on these boards. If you have faith in your PCB manufacturer, I say go for it. I'm unsure how to deal with the rights to the design or anything, but if you're square in the legal section it's a solid idea. If you end up going through with it, let me know I'll buy some and I we can probably work out some kind pricing with you and customers if you want to refer warranty repairs and such to me!

Depends on what you do, main problem with "VESC6 Trampa edition" is the trademark. Nothing stops you from taking the schematics, making your PCB by yourself, having it full blown compatible with VESC-Tool without mods. As long as either you pay for trademark and call it VESC 6 with Ben's approval, or you name it differently and state "based on..." or "compatible with..." 

This way you're out of pursuit boundaries cause it still originates from an open-source project and not a patented closed project.

BTW, as @stewii has proven, you don't need the reference design to get a quality piece of hardware made. A wonrg turn somewhere was taken in the course of VESC, and I believe people like stewii and you, and even Jason with FOCBOX will take it back to the right path. 

You guys just need to make things fair for the people who will buy your stuff.

You're right to check and I don't even know where you're living, laws vary but the core logic of most contracts remains the same no matter where you live.

So Jason had this to say about manufacturing Vescs in the US
[quote="onloop, post:250, topic:19089"]
we are now manufacturing in a new Shenzen factory that specializes in Tablet & Phone PCBA. Failures rates near ZERO! & Much faster production!
[/quote]

[quote="onloop, post:250, topic:19089"]
Our previous factory in the US had 18% failure rates in the last batch. Our last order was 1000 units & only approx 800 passed our QC process.
[/quote]

[quote="onloop, post:250, topic:19089"]
To our suprise, We discovered they swapped some capacitors to upgraded versions not available from USA sources! we complained originally (because normally swapping means bad) However, after testing with very high-end lab equipment, we realised they were higher spec than our BOM.

I am not trying to start a get rich company I want to  offer decent controllers to people that currently cannot afford them. Even at 18% attrition I could sell those at 50% as do it yourself no warranty repairs. Or you know send them back...

This is starting to get off-topic.

Frankly, and most of us here will attest to, that the ASSUMED cost of making/building something rarely equals the REAL cost.

You will probably have some legal hurdles. Just do as much research as possible, talk to BV, and remember...most of the legal problems will start if 'VESC6' is anywhere IN the name.

Hi, 

@bimmer, before you go any further, I highly suggest you to contact those factory to see exactly the work they will do for you. They could also guide you through the hole process. Because you can‚Äôt just get a quotation from there website, it is never really representative of the reality. I was reading your quotation and some of these number seemed off, and other important part are missing. 

Also, Time wise it isn‚Äôt really adding up, I can tell you from experience a project like this is can easily take 3-4 month (not 10 days), and you probably have to invest 150-200hours of tour own time (just for the production, I‚Äôm not talking about supporting your product)

As for your question ¬´ Is it worth the risk? ¬ª it is up to you, If you‚Äôre ready to take the risk, why not, but it is far from being a easy project, specially if you have no experience.

So  none of this is set in stone and the prices were more to get your attention. This thread is more about is it legal or not... My knowledge about manufacturing is not up for debate especially not based of of what I do in this forum after work... No of y'all  money is at risk I will end up with working boards or not. I will weigh my options on new designs with or without nrf and without that garstly gyro sensor. Also I will schedule an appointment with a lawyer just to be safe. The money wont hurt (me) if it fails my wife might be mad though...I will rather do my research.

Just FYI the price for the cases is agreed upon I just don't wan't to show my emails around a public forum.
Also the price for the  parts as of now is with NRF and is also not avariable.
I assume prices for the fab and  assembly may change as I have so  far only asked @stewii the price for 40 pcb's and if he would sell me his gerber files which the latter has not been responded to yet.

Vesc4 and below couldn't do 100% duty because of only two current sensors and the time delay between phases so it is limited to 0.95 or 95% duty in the software


The 6 schematic has 3 current sense circuits, but still cannot do 100% duty reliably. Even though the DRV supports 100% duty. That's it.

Not really... the best exemple (related to our field) is the Focbox as mentioned earlier, over 20% of failure strait from the factory, and they weren‚Äôt not event able to fix them (I know because they all ended on my desk). And they where able to find those defective, because the lead engineer from Enertion decide to put test jig in place, if he haven‚Äôt can you image how many people would have been disappointed (it would probably have been the end of Enertion).

I'm not doing that.. I'm simply stating..

The upside to spending the money on additional components over the 4.12 bom and having 3 current sensors would be 100% duty. But it's not... Focbox and vesc6 erpm max is basically the same. Just add more aluminum to disipate heat  I was saying apples to apples the erpm is based on the speed of directfets and how cool you run them.

Also I said never because 60v max. On a 260kv motor... On 14S is ~107kerpm... 

I know I wouldn't ever use a high kv motor on 14s...it's not practical due to saturation.

Can you say in anyway an esk8 you would hit higher then 107k? @b264

I mean let's think about it hubs are in the 10k-26k erpm range depending on kv

A mountain board that you could use the extra erpm with more reduction...  Let's take 14s as the max(if you had magura disc brakes and braking disabled on the esc) and a large reduction of 12/80 on 8" tires that's still 54mph...  On 7" 47mph. Dunno about you but mountain boards aren't for speed.. they need torque. So erpm is out the window there. Especially since you can't run a big reduction with small tires

13s 190kv... Done... that's  only about 74k erpm... And about the max voltage... And will easily do 40mph..

How many more erpms do you need?

Anything faster and I'd rather be on an analog board.

As it turns out my wife's opinion on go big or go home is not the same as mine. The family treasurer has given me permission to make 50...and wait a month to see responses. This is not a group buy I and am going in 100% self funded I'd like to gauge Interesst at 150$. No EU shipping. 
It would be. 
1 x Bimmers-foc-esc hw6.4 70mm 
awg 10 power wires xt-90/xt-60, 
awg 12 60mm 4mm bullet motor wires
1x Aluminum case 7075
1x Cover for said case
I'll have these made and will test every single one for motor detection, uart ( bluetooth) , sensors and ppm.
They will have nrf but it will be untested.

Uh duh, focbox is 4.12 hardware with direct fets and two current shunts. Vesc 6 has three current shunts

Please tell me what you really think the difference is between the two. Aside from drv8301(limited fault output vs 8302(full fault readout) and the current shunts. Because they're pretty much the same... Lol

Maybe you should take a look at the schematic.. because the gyro/acclerometer and NRF addition to the vesc 6 hardware does nothing for performance...

Well, that depends what you use it for. The approach for the VESC6 isnt solely towards esk8ing but very general. The gyro and acclerometer can be used for many fun things, from a personal perspective I use the vedder nunchuck mod so I dont have to fit a cheap ass e-bay chip+antenna in there that eventually gives up, since its all integrated (which was the reasoning behind the nrf in the first place).  In regards to performance, I havnt burned my DRV on my current VESC6 yet, and I've had one prototype soldered since the very first alfa iteration about 1+year ago... so theres that. Lost count on the replaced DRV's while trying to tune the FOC on the 4.x hardware. But if you say that you dont feel any difference i applaud you.

Havn't had the opportunity to fully test 12S yet but from what i understand alot less units fail due to pushing the voltage boundries compared to 4.xx. 

Regarding the Three shunts, with only two shunts the 3d current reading is calculated instead of a live value. Which turned out to be unfavorable in many cases. But there are many applications where two shunts are enough.

Selling 6.4 HW for $130 would sell out very quickly in my opinion. I‚Äôd buy two to replace my brand new FOCBOXs with these and then just sell those. These are cheaper than FOCBOXes, better than FOCBOXes, and more accessible than FOCBOXes for all US esk8 riders. They would all sell for certain but I would assume less than a month if I had to guess.

i wish everyone would stop talking about vesc legal shit here. ITs not fucking rocket surgery and its barely relevant. 

VESC 6 is open source. If you avoid the registered TRADEMARKS, you're fine. You can make them all damned day and charge whatever you want as long as you don't call it a VESC. End of legal. 

i really don't know why people find this so damn complicated. Trampa's not going to sue anybody. if the weight of their VESC 6 hoarding doesn't crush them completely, they're barely be able to afford legal anyway after they stock them all and no one buys them because they're too goddamned expensive for what they are. 

And you assholes need to stop trying to intimidate people into not doing things. I'm sick of that shit. I have a pile of PMs in my inbox that i keep and laugh at. Every one of them is a vendor, on this site, telling me what  i shouldn't get into. Fuck all of you for sending me that shit. I'm not going to name names until my book is published, and there will be a long list of "fuck you i did it anyway you sore fucking losers" credits to read through. I don't care how long you've been doing it and what issues you had. That doesn't make you some kind of special snowflake who is the only one that can do a thing. Suck it. Either provide constructive feedback or GTFO. 

@bimmer do it and i'll start buying from you if they prove reliable. If you like you can send me test units and we'll beat the crap out of them and provide plenty of feedback. I already have retail in place so i'd be happy to help you move them. I was going to try and have some made anyway for the same reasons.

There's nothing - legally - stopping you from creating an ESC that has the same specifications as the VESC 6, you just can't call it a VESC.

Electrical items are manufactured either identical or practically identical to other electrical items daily, there's nothing the law can do about it because those components used to make that item are freely available on the market for anyone to buy and construct. As long as you steer clear of the name VESC and ideally, come up with some differentiator between this ESC and a VESC 6, you will be fine.
Certain people won't like it, but you'll be fine, legally...

I can see everyone is trying to develop this idea so I hope we have VESCs 6 with good price tags available from different sources soon.

Btw my ESCape from @stewii is running pretty good after 300kms will let you guys know when I reach 1000 miles, on the other hand so are my focboxes on my Darth Maul and my @torqueboards 4.12 on my Vanguard after more that 5000kms

The admins, if they see something that violates the rules, will just close the topic with a succinct post as to why they shut it down.

The rules are in place for a reason. Yes it's frustrating for those trying to establish themselves and help the community, but rules are rules and there are reasons behind each one.

On another note, I hope this thread doesn't get shut down. Hopefully a level 3 member will volunteer to help with this situation, since it's a great opportunity for the community to have access to HW6.4 without the exorbitant price tag.

@bimmer as a level 2, you can sell parts in the new items catagory. 
Whether it's a group buy or Pre-order or reservation or what ever you want to call it.
 As a level 2, you may not take members money until you have the items ready to ship.
You need to just buy the parts and make the Esc's and then sell them on a first come first serve basis.
I am shutting this topic down and you can repost your Esc's for sale when you have them ready to ship.

Thank you @Namasaki 

An update on the Esc's,  PCB's and Covers are inroute.

Heatsinks are here and I might solder up an ESC this afternoon to send to @longhairedboy  so he can abuse it.

It would still be the old Pcb not the new 2Oz and immersion gold one.

For now I have ordered the basic BOM which would give you only the ESC (FOC/BLDC) functionality and no NRF or motion sensor. Is this enough or do people want the NRF? (I am under the impression there is only 1 remote that works so far and it has to be assembled). I am looking into having those made as well but we just signed to build a house and I probably won't get the OK to start another project until this one is done with.

i'm mainly interested in the increased power handling and abuse tolerance. I've managed to eak about as much life out of a focbox as i can get using just settings and vibrational damping techniques.

We use a multi-phase ESC abuse testing schema in our shop with a built in vendor feedback loop. Here are the phases and vendor feedback interface descriptions::

1) hit them with sticks before even opening the box. Toss them around like you're a UPS man on crack and you just found out about some upcoming layoffs. Should this phase fail, the vendor will be beaten with sticks as well. 
2) open the packages carefully using a pair of rabid direwolves instead of a razor. If any product remains in tact, continue testing. If not, feed vendor to direwolves.
3) Travel to north dakota and strap ESC to double bladed axe in a single drive configuration using a 1:1 gearing ratio on 11" steel wheels and ride the axe repeatedly into trees and campers. If trees fall and campers run screaming into the cold night, continue testing. Otherwise ram vendor with axe board until dead. 
4) ride ESC equipped axe into heavy traffic during business hours while dragging a dead moose via tow chain in order to load test the traces and components. Should the ESC overheat, vendor will be dragged through heavy traffic instead of moose using a set of FocBoxes. 
5) remove ESC from axe board and continue to beat with sticks. This time, the sticks should be on fire and the ESCs should be mounted to the face of a statue of Frank from Trampa. Should the ESCs fail to remain in tact, vendor will be pants'd and youtubed. 


If all tests are passed and the ESC and vendor are still in tact, the product will receive our seal of approval. I would also like to point out that our process is more forgiving and less excruciating than becoming UL listed.

I also have a sunkko 788H spot welder. I don't care what anyone says about those, i've been using mine for almost two years now and its solid. 

also using a generic solder station from MPJA 
http://www.mpja.com/Solder-Station-with-LED-Display-ZD-929C/productinfo/15845+TL/

I could be paying thousands for any one of those tools if i got equivalent "industrial" whatever, i guess you just have to find the stuff that works.

I have all three of those and yes, they work but the industrial stuff is just soooo much better. The problem with a lot of that stuff is qc and reliability. I have 2 sunkko welder and one of them is the shit while the other is simply shit... my CNC welder is light years ahead! It makes a week long job into an afternoon worth of watching the thing go. 

Soldering station is the one place where I truly agree that there is no reason to spend thousands. Unless you go for a station that has all the fancy stuff like a pre heater, air reflow, board temp sensors, and a solder pot. Even then, the chinesium stuff usually works 90% as well as the real industrial stuff, just don't trust their temperature readouts. 

The IR heater melts connectors. I've never had great a experience with it. It's great for placing most components though and then finishing connectors up by hand. I use an eaven fancier technic for reflowing! It is called the walmart $10 skillet and block of aluminum on top to spread heat more evenly. You can get your pcb to sit at a toasty 75-100c and then just wave around the reflow pen as the solder flows! Works wonderfully on double sided pcbs too. Industry really saves more money in pick and place machines than the ovens themselves I believe.

Dude!!! Check this out! I need this in my life...

Hey @bimmer could you say how heavy is your b-box? I got the escape and the whole thingy it's 225gr almost half kilo for 2!!
I'm curious if your approach of the box is noticeable lighter.

[quote="bimmer, post:84, topic:44375, full:true"]
Oh short shipping and response time also lower shipping cost incase of rma. Basically this is a test and if something goes wrong 5.60$ shipping sounds better than 18$ ontop of refunding someone or replacing/fixing something.
[/quote]

Wait wait wait... so when you say "no EU shipping", do you mean "no EU shipping" or "only USA shipping"? Because that's an enormous difference. That's why I asked "Why specifically EU?" It seems strange to limit shipping to "worldwide except EU".

The reason I say this is that I want to prepurchase 2 of these sexy bimmers but I'm in Australia. The thing is, if I have a problem and need to RMA, I'll just pay the shipping costs. I'd rather have the risk of having to pay more shipping than not be able to buy them at all.

I'm sorry it's taking so long. I just want to be sure everything will go as smooth as possible once people have given me their money. I am in the final phase of making these. I have all parts so far. There is a minor discrepancy with the case and lid. I had the heat sinks made according to the old case design but Stewie made the Cover Pcb's according to the new one. I'll have to modify the holes to accommodate this.
As for assembly we should be able to start in a week.![15194872875911551908582|281x500](upload://v51ZXEKcglXtKdar5LtXVMnJZxk.jpg)

I definitely won't use that, I'll either use a `vesc_tool_0.87` Linux build or [the Ackamaniac one](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/extended-ackmaniac-esc-tool-based-on-vesc-tool/35116/200) if it has 64 firmware

Very first post... Lets say I would sell these at a moderate 130$ + tax(5.6%)=137$ I am pretty sure they‚Äôd sell out in a month.

If there is no tax being added then never mind but you can not add on a tax to an item when someone could be living in a state that doesn‚Äôt have taxes.

Can you tell me how it is not damaging? Because it's kinda the same situation then people connect CAN cable with 5V coming from another ESC, or plugging split ppm cable with joined 5V power lead. In those situations, DRV is always popping up so I am trying to imagine how is this different?

Because I don't see any protection against force feeding 5V back to DRV chip.

In case of the canbus problem there is a full 5v short circuit.
In this case there is a smaller differential in voltage and the canbus chip may cope with this.

And there is probably a good reason why Vedder left r1 unistalled....

Not only you can damage your Vesc but also your PC, that why it was removed from the VESC

"The issue is that the two 5 V sources will not be at EXACTLY the same voltage.  One will be a little bit higher, the other a little bit lower.

Each of them will try to regulate the Bus at their voltage, and they will fight each other.

Likely one, or both, power supplies will die, perhaps catastrophically, damaging all of the other circuitry as well."

I think this summerise the issue you will get at a certain point.

You got me curious so I compared the 2 datasheets: the old canbus chip has this tolerance on the CANH and CANL pins : -4 to 16v
The new chip brings the tolerance up: -58 to +58v. Thats quite an improvement

I made an initial batch. The SMD work I had done (by someone who should have done far better work) was sub par. I don't have the time nor really the expertise to make a larger batch here at home myself.
Since I absolutely want everyone to have a good product and a hassle free setup and ride I cannot with good conscience sell more completed boards at this time. 

Anyone who wants a bare PCB can contact me.

If we get enough people (like 20) I will make DIY kits with all components and documentation to do it yourself.

Hopefully soon we will be able to offer factory made PCB's that will be tested on a jig with a 300KV sensored motor spinning a weight.

Once the PCB's pass they will be assembled according to wishes I guess Single, Dual. Still doing research on acquiring the heatsinks. 

The current heatsink I use only covers 60% of 3 mosfets but so far running in a 12s5p setup I have had no heat related issues so I will sell them with this disclaimer.

I apologize to everyone who got their hopes up we would have a fast, cheap and reliable solution.

I have a 100% refund policy on everything I do and fix any Issue anyone has even if that means I lose money, I do this for the community but at this scale I poses to much risk as of now.

The DIY Kits will be your responsibility unless you come up short on parts there will be no refunds or returns once the first drop of solder has flown.
