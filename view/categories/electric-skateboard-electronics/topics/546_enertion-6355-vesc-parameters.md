does anyone know the recommended settings for enertion's motor on the VESC?

I know the VESC's from the jason come pre-loaded with the optimal settings for his motor, but since I don't have one from that batch, I'm just running off what I got from the motor detection. 

I know it probably doesn't make a huge difference (as I assume Jason is just using the settings he got from the motor detection, with a little tweaking),  but I was just curious.

```
use the numbers that get generated from the detection process.
