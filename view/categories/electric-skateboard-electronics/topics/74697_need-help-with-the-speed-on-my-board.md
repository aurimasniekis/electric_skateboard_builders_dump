Hello there guys. Semi-noob here. I have built myself a 10s3p electric longboard and it's been working nicely for a while but the speed for it refuses to go higher than about 10km and I have not changed any settings for the board. Any ideas as to what this could be would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

We kind of need everything to be honest.  As Roman says a whole lot more info is needed before help can be attained.
