I am using Samsung 30Q batteries in a 12S4P, dual 6374 190kv motors with dual ESCapes.  I just want to be able to protect the batteries but I really don't know what to buy.

I bought a Bestech BMS from @JLabs and so far, it is working great!
Supports 12s and it is what a good chunk of the forum uses for a 12s BMS.
Just be sure to know what you are doing when you are wiring! :slight_smile:

Thanks for the shout @Brontech! You can find the BMS here:

@Brontech could I ask you to leave a review on the BMS?
