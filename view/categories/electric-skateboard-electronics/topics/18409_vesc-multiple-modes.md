As i've noticed with a lot of the big brand name e-boards, a lot of them seem to have different modes for different speeds. I was wondering if it was possible to program the vesc and remote so that it was possible to have multiple modes.

You can do that via my firmware mod, a Bluetooth module and a Android smartphone.
