Hello, I have finnally got a hand on all my parts that I ordered and I am planning on wiring it all up tomorrow. I was hoping I could ask a big favour if you could look over my wiring diagram for me for 12s with BMS.

Parts:
- 4x Zippy 3s 5000mAh 20c lipo batteries in series 
- SK8 4.12 Vesc
- 12s BMS from eBay
- 5.5x2.5mm female charge port going to laptop style charger
- SK8 6374 motor

My hope is to balance charge with my laptop style charger and discharge directly from the batteries. 

If you have any questions just ask and I will answer.

here it is! I hope it is clear enough to understand

Did this workout for you? I have a similar BMS and all 3s batteries was wanting to make sure I hook it up right.

Where would the power button go in this diagram? I have a similar setup. 

And is the last negative balance cable on the lipo pack connected to the B- port? I have an 13th wire on my BMS which I'm not sure where it goes.
