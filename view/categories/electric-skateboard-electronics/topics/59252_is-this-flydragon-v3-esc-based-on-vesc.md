So I found this ESC and it looks quite similar to VESC design. Is it actually VESC or not even close?

This ESC is should be based on the HobbyWing Platinum 80A HV V3 OPTO

Can´t imagine it having a brake. If it did then maybe drag brakes - which is not so good in my own personal experience. I used a "flight" ESC - Turnigy K-Force 120a in particular but I´d advice you to save your money and grab a VESC of your choice. 

cheers
