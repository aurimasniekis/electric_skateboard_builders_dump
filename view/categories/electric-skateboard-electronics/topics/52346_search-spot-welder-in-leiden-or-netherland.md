Either you didn't search at all or you searched using wrong words. 

Is it that hard? Lol

I'm getting it fixed though! In a couple weeks it should be operational again. I'm in Amsterdam North

Hey @Tijmen, I'm looking for a batterypack as well. If you still have room in your schedule to make one, could you send me a quotation for a 10s3p 30q (flat) pack with BMS?

Thanks :slight_smile:
