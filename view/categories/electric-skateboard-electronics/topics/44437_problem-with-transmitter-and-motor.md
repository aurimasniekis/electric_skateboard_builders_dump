Hello everyone, I would have a problem.
I started testing for the motor and I have a gt2e transmitter, for half the movement the motor stays still and then becomes too sensitive.

I have 9s lipo, maytech vesc

Are you sure about the control mode ? (1st screenshot)
I don't know much about Maytech VESCs, but usually on a VESC, you want to select the "Current no reverse with brakes".

You did calibrate the remote right?

```
Is current control better than duty cycle? and I have set the minimum and maximum value but there is always an empty period
