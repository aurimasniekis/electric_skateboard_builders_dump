I have been a lurker for a Long time, and made a board i had up and running. Then I began to upgrade and bought some foc boxes for a dual set-up.

A few month ago I connected to them and uploaded ackmaniac's firmware. Now I have gotten all the last peices for my project. And the weather has finally become ridable.

The problem is now I can't get a connection to do a setup. 
I've tried everything I can think of, and all I can find on this great forum.

I have posted some pictures that might help troubleshooting.

English is not my first language, sorry for any misspellings.

Are you sure it's connected to the cable? The focbox micro usb header is a bit recessed and requires a longer connector to reach, or alternatively you can take off the housing to  connect with any cable.

Yes I have taken the enclosure off for that specific reason.

probably worth checking if you have an unknown device in your device manager, you've managed to change the fw, so the usb was in working order.

make sure you are using a usb cable that can transfer data, not those crappy charge only cables

Okay, it's just that the picture you have on there still has the enclosure on.

The picture was after I gave up and put it all back together ðŸ˜€ 

Might be a stupid question but how do I check if I have an unknown device ?

looks like you already tried different cables right? If no, do so.

Also switch of bluetooth on your laptop just in case itÂ´s on.

Check if you have all driver installed you need. Should be if you used it before, but who knows, never bad to check that.

in the last link you should find the right driver you need.

unfortunately I canÂ´t tell you how to set it to auto detect on a WIN pc. Might just need to goolgle it. shouldnÂ´t be a big thing.

If you plug in the USB cable to your PC and the focbox, you hear a ping noice that the device was recognized?

And I worked afterwards as well. So I know for a fact that the firmware installed correctly. I just didn't have all my parts, so I didn't finish me setup

jap thatÂ´s strange, you used 

7x different cables

different pcÂ´s 

have all drivers

no red LEDs

USB port is clean

and same issue on different focboxes.


Do you remember you shorted something on the usb port maybe during that time?
