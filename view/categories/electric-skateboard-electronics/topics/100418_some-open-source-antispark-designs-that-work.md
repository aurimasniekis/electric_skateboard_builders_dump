Since I keep seeing this come up, just thought I'd share.

They both work. The first one is easier to assemble on PCB and I trust it a lot more by virtue of high side switching

The second one is easy to build on protoboard, no need for a PCB. 

Both have been tested by members of the community, I can cite their testimony if someone wants.
There could still possibly be issues, if someone makes these and encounters one, please let me know.

Both require a latching pushbutton, I recommend this one from adafruit:

Some smart antisparks are on the way in the near future.
