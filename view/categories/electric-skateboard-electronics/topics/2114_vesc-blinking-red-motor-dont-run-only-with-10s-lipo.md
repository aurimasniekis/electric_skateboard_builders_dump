Oi pessoal. Eu fiz uma pesquisa sobre o f√≥rum para encontrar uma solu√ß√£o para o meu problema Vesc mas n√£o encontramos nada. Eu programar meu tanto Vesc com bateria de 1000mAh 3s e conectado via CAN bus e tudo estava funcionando bem. O i swap para 10s 8000mAh lipo e quando eu virar bord no mestre come√ßa a piscar vermelho e o motor n√£o gira. O escravo est√° funcionando bem sempre com luz azul. Alguma ideia

Sorry i didn't realize that i post in portuguese.
Hi guys.

I did a research on the forum to find a solution to my vesc problem but didnt find anything. I program my both vesc with 3s 1000mah battery and connected via can bus and everything was working fine. The i swap to 10s lipo 8000mah and when i turn bord on the master starts blinking red and the motor doesn't spin. The slave is working fine always with blue light. Any thoughts?

I already reflash the firmware on the master and program again with 3s lipo and it was working fine, but again when i plug 10s lipo the red light starts blinking and the motor dont spin.

Also the master started blinking red after i tried to run the motor in foc mode.
When i was running in bldc mode both vesc was working fine via can bus.

I run motor detection with 10s lipo and faild.
Terminal: FAULT_CODE_DRV8302.
So i think i have to replace the chip.
But with 3s te motor detection works with no faults on the terminal. Its wierd.

Sombody know where i can buy DRV8302 chip?

There's a rule that you have to have at least 20 characters in your post. LHB wrote a sentence to make his post longer so that it would send.

No. I don't understand what you did there. Did you put spaces at the end?
