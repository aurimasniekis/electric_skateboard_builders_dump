Hey, VESC 4.xx here. Noticed today that this part is broken on my VESC. It still spins the motor fine. Anyone think this can cause problems? Should I try to replace the part?

Thats the inductor coil. it's probably fine. but it's not very expensive or hard to relplace.

The black stuff that is chipped is ferrite, it has some electrical properties for the Component so you might lose some inductance. I'm more worried that it's been abused enough to affect the solder pads. But if the vesc is running, Its probably not an issue

The VESC has less than 30 miles on it, I think it got dropped or something. I'll look into replacing it. Thanks!
