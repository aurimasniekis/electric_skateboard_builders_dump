I've spent hours and maybe even days researching and taking notes on electric skateboards, so I have a fairly good grasp on how it works and how to build these boards. Recently, I've had the idea to modify the Blink Lite. I would probably replace the hub motors and potentially go for a bigger battery, the battery would have to be able to connect to the port already available and maybe still fit in the enclosure. Does anyone want to take a stab at this with me? What is the kv rating for their hub motors? Thanks!
