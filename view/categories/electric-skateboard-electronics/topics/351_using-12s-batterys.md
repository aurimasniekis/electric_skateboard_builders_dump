has any one tried using 12s batteries with the new R spec 190kv 2.0 motor yet ? like 2 6s in series

not me personally, but I know of a couple builds running r-specs and 12s batteries.

here's a thread on endless sphere where a guy (who has a pretty freakin sweet build too) runs dual r-specs on 12s

i ordered esc's good for 12s and two 6s 20,000mah lipo's to use with the 190kv R spec motor. but was worried the motor might burn out. ive looked all over the web for some one thats tested this and didnt find much. i am using a twin motor set up. these are the esc's im going to be using http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/catalog/17981.jpg
and the batterys

You'll be fine though. You can go for a higher gearing ratio like 12T/13T with 36T but IMO it doesn't do any benefit so you might as well keep the top speed and just don't use it. It's nice to have some throttle left in the tank.

Those packs are big though and at 2 of those.. I really think you'll probably have trouble holding those packs to your board.. Would be nice to see though :smile:

Jebus! that thing would be a monster. 
39.9mph thats 64 km/h!!!! 

far out 40km/h is too fast for me

and range around 90 km / 56miles!! 
you might need a trailer to carry those batteries though.

The c rating alone doesn't matter. Those batteries can draw 200 amps continuously which is more than enough for an electric skateboard/longboard. Out of curiosity, what esc(s) are you planning on using. Single or dual motor setup?

I believe price and convenience are probably the main considerations, since you'll have the same number of individual 3.7V cells in series, regardless. It's just a matter of how many are packaged in the sold packs yielding how many packs you need to wire together. Being able to charge more smaller packs in parallel would make charging faster as well, but maybe less convenient.

Your design layout might make one choice better than the other as well, I suppose. For example, improving clearance by using more thinner packs.

Look for the most Ah's in the smallest complete package you can group together. They list dimensions on every battery you'll find and some of them are just too thick to allow you proper clearance if you're planning on mounting then to your board.

I put this together a couple of weeks ago. Prices might not be the same, but it might be useful for getting some idea (Prices were for AR warehouse). $US / Wh is probably the most interesting column.

The two packs I ordered will hang 60mm under the board. But with 97mm abec wheels ground clearance is not really a problem

60mm is huge. Most people are shooting for 45mm or under. If you're not going to be going over speedbumbs or up and over wheelchair access on sidewalks you'll probably be alright. You may need to use risers though.

[/quote]

so the 97mm diameter would be 48.5mm from the truck. caliber trucks are 58mm from the hanger to the baseplate (don't quote me on that, but I'm 90% sure its between 55 and 60mm) so without risers it'll put you at roughly 46mm of ground clearance before you add mounting hardware or take into account deck flex. 

could be better, but still isn't a lowrider by any means!

Cut that 97mm diameter down to a radius and the figures will make more sense...Being that wheel is centered on an axle.(half of it sits above the axle) It is actually going to be 23mm of ground clearance

I started to say that if you have the wheelbase to suit it, and you can find them, i'd go with 4 3S 10Ah packs because that would give you more ground clearance... but i don't think it would considering that the prismatic cells in these packs are typically all the same width or are very close at least. 

I wish I could get 40 miles out of a single charge. That would allow me to commute without firing up a noisy charger or looking for a place to plug in at work.  Maybe I should do some more research and find a better way to stack cells.

Well I set up a push on push off anti spark button switch and arming plug today. I used a small pelican case to in close the esc's bec and receiver. Every thing fit in nice and snug. I found some really cool Velcro straps to mount the battery's with. Three straps per battery plus Velcro on the batteries to stick them to the board. I'm going to screw the Velcro straps to the board so nothing can come loose.the esc's came with 4mm bullet motor connectors so I'm replacing them with 5.5mm to match up with what's on the motors.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/5ad40fd0ae4980566ce0083690129aca53e961c6.JPG" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/8bb230b4f184f8fdb4e45942f5a077b08f68595a.JPG" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/4b32c27bb8b4629f17a9289a685c3890badba169.JPG" width="281" height="500">

The esc's I'm using are for rc aircraft with no reverse and the transmitter I'm using is for a rc car with the stick set in the center witch for these aircraft esc's is half throttle at that ms. I could put a rubber band on the throttle holding it all the way forward till i pull on it but I'm wondering if there is some other way to fix this issue. Any one ?

you should be able to program the ESC's and/or calibrate the transmitter.
I know that I had this issue with my first ESC which was an aircraft version (much better off with a car version (or VESC)) im pretty sure there was some setting somewhere that allowed calibration.

I have yet to have seen a car ESC that can be used with a 12s lipo battery that's 50 volts. Yes when programing the ESC first hold throttle at full then plug in battery into ESC hear two beeps and then you have to put the throttle all the way down as they call it witch for this transmitter is full reverse. So wait your telling me I could leave it at half and the ESC would program that as off or brake??

Looks like a great build so far!  Some serious Ah!  Let us know what she weighs in at when finished.  Not one you'd want to carry around all day, but with the range you can ride everywhere!

If you have issues with your ESC's i would definitely recommend the VESC as a better ESC for e-boards.  I think Enertion has some in process shipping next month...

Keep us updated and nice build!

Omg I just went for my first ride on it ! Its so fast that I almost fell off the back of it ! Its got super powers ! I mean you would have to be superman just to dare to use full throttle at all ! I think I need handle bars just to hold on ! I was barley able to even use 1/4 throttle and its touchy I think I might tone it down to 6s and keep the second battery in my back pack for long rides. Ya like 80 miles lol.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/a34114352b8e1dcf4b3bbcc00db05478ca930877.JPG" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/4d5882dacfc2f8b05edd0c70373d55f637dd696c.JPG" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/01a526cd0f3f6ba84e59b17cbf0d48fc770b3f8b.JPG" width="690" height="388">

Also. I would suggest running the motor wires backwards then bending them back forwards.

It doesn't look like you have much slack in the wire for turning.

It will damage the motor if those phase wires get pulled hard during a deep sharp turn.

I tried out the brakes on these esc's and there was no coast and the brakes were so hard that I fell off the board to a running stop. No that won't work. Lol . im still not done with this build. I still need to screw  the esc box to the board cuz its just Velcroed on right now. I want to try it out with just one battery. I think maybe the throttle might not be so jurky on just 6s. Pluse there is no way I could ever mash all the way down on the throttle using 12s. It just accelerate way to fast. Maybe if I program in some expo that might help.

I had similar trouble with my first ESC that I ever tried. it was an aircraft version and the brakes were brutal. I ended up just disabling them all together and using my foot to brake.
also the acceleration was brutal as well. both cases seemed to be all or nothing.. even when programmed to softest.

the next ESC I got was a car version.. much much nicer to use.

fortunately for me I was using the wii nunchuck for control so I was able to use the cruise control function to sustain low speed.

Well today I got the battery straps screwed down to the bottom of the board and screwed down the esc box. I turned down the throttle end point to 20% and still could not max out the throttle when riding the board. 15% expo also seemed to help calm it down a bit but its still a beast on 12s. It's crazy that at half throttle I'm hitting 25 to 30 mph <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/5cd5aed3eaea939eaf542b9c739db49842805af3.JPG" width="690" height="388">

Changing the end point down to 20% only seems to change speeds over half throttle.  The other half end point goes the other direction so I can only turn that up to 120% but all that seems to change is how soon the throttle engages when you pull on the trigger.

OK today I dared to maxed out 100% throttle and had my friend riding his motorcycle next to me. His speedo read 39 to 41mph on the top end. I couldn't hold it for to long and it took two blocks to slow down to a stop. Omg I was shaking when I stopped lol. The motors and esc's were just warm not hot at all. Well I'm not doing that again. That was to fast. I so need to get a new go pro camera.

Yikes. Good job holding on! So is everything set up the way you entered it into that calculator? Or what percent efficiency does it correspond to the way it's set up now?

I dont think that Calculator is giving real world figures for my application. Cuz its giving weighted and unweighted numbers. If it was right then with me standing on the board (weighted) I would not have been able to go 40mph. The other thing is I'm using two motors not just one as in that calculation. So I would say I'm getting 100+ efficiency with the two motors. 14 tooth drive pully 36 tooth driven 97mm wheel.

OK so I'm going to try some thing new. Two of these  4s lipo's in series for 8s power with these 200A esc's. They have a burst of 1000A and 200A continues. They also have a brake and reverse. my board should get lighter and faster on 8s over the 6s I'm using now. 12s was just to fast and 6s thou with 40,000ma range 6s only gave me a top speed of 23mph. With a brake things should be safer lol . I also won't have the throttle trigger problem I had with these aircraft esc's that i fixed with a rubber band. These 4s lipo's are much thinner as well some 20mm thinner.  So I'll have a bit more ground clearance too.

Nice! I bought 4 5.2 6s Multistar batteries for my build. I'm a bigger guy at 215lbs so I think I'll need the 12s power. I can then use the other 2 batteries for added range while I run a single motor and then add them in for when I upgrade to a dual motor setup in the future. My commute is only 2 miles round trip so I am hoping 5,200 mah is enough for that.

Can't wait to see what you come up with next!

Well with twin motors you get less motor cogging more torque up hills and the acceleration is incredible. Even on 6s twin motors hall butt. With 12s and twin motors your turned into a rocket !

With twin motors I feel like the green goblin on his sky board lol<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/f2b8960f754706c3423fe959fa5c7761fb3f98e6.jpg" width="356" height="500">

Two 8s car esc's two 20,000ma 4s lipo's in series for 8s. No more throttle trigger problems and now I have brakes. Punch control is cool too. No more jurky throttle control. Oh and the esc's have fans on them to keep them nice and cool. The esc's were to big to fit in the case so I mounted them on the out side <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d7dd1e511cd81204b7c555de3ba799e0d3afdfef.JPG" width="281" height="500">
The board is now much lighter then it was ! These 4s lipo's are only 40mm thick so I got more ground clearance now so I might take one of the truck spacers out on each truck. I need to figure out what resistor to use for the anti spark switch. I set punch control at 100% because any thing less and this 8s power wants to jurk the board out from under me like the 12s did. Will reducing the motor timing from 8 degrees down to 4 degrees help reduce some of that jurky throttle response and if so what about 0 degrees timing ?

Any ideas on the motor timing settings 0-4-8-16-30 degrees. I tried it out on 0 and acceleration was slow and steady. At 4 the acceleration was a bit stronger. At 8 degrees the acceleration was quick and a bit jurky. All tests were done with punch control set at high 100% any thing less and the board wants to jurk out from under me with only a small change in throttle when motor timing was at 8 degrees. I'm going to try motor timing set at 4 degrees and turn punch control down a notch at a time till it trys to jurk the board out from under me then turn it back one notch. I do like acceleration but not to the point where it becomes dangerous.

Ya but are you using 6s 8s 10s or 12s. At 6s you would not need alot of punch control if any at all. I'm running 8s and twin motors so more punch control is needed.

By lowest. I mean most. Did I confuse you?
Like i mean slowest acceleration so that im not doing manuals every time i accelerate.

@lowGuido what's wrong with doing manuals every time you accelerate? I thought that was proper form.  lol

I wish I could stay on the board with no punch control and motor timing set at 30 degrees on 12s. That much acceleration would be mind blowing lol. Wahooo ! Maybe I should set it up like that next time someone asks can I ride it ?

What about motor timing ? I'm using 4 degrees cuz at 8 degrees the acceleration is still a bit to much. I tried it at 0 degrees and the acceleration was way to spoungy.

I use whatever the maximum timing setting is on my ESC. have never tried anything less.

I maxed out at 26 mph today on 8s and 15/36 gears 97mm wheels. Motor timing set at 4 degrees. Punch control set at 90% God I love having brakes now and these esc's rock lots of fun adjustments with this programming card and I can take it with me to make adjustments along my ride. I wonder if having motor timing at 8 degrees or 16 would net a higher top speed.

I just figured out that I don't need a bec with these esc's :-) the red power wire just needed to be hooked up . the red wire on these esc's are cut short  so is not Used but it puts out 6 volts for a receiver. Wondering why the manufacturer did that ?

Probably so they could sell BECs.

Electric power is the future! 55 miles is completely insane though.
