So my 4s batteries have 8AWG wires, as i can see XT60 won't fit to solder on. XT90 will fit on those thick wires. So why not use XT90s, or there is no need for that? Does batteries spark when plugging into charger?

Just use 5.5mm Bananas or better take the xt90s.
And yes, lipos spark from time to time while putting them in a charger

You shouldn't get a shower of sparks just one little spark when you first plug it in. if it sparks a ton or get really hot unplug it and check you polarity.
