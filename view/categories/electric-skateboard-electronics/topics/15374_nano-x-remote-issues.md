Just wondering if any of you are having issues with the new Nano-X remote from Enertion? It's a great remote when compared to the "Winning" that I received with my Raptor 1. But it's only good one time. What I mean by that is that it binds once and then after you power the board down it doesn't pair again until unplugged from the receiver and then plugged back in. I have 2 Nano-X's and they both do the same thing. Let me know if you guys with the same remote are experiencing the same issue.

I'm having the same problem.  I've gotten it to bind 2 times.  both times it failed to stay synced after restarting the board.  I'm currently talking with customer support to get this fixed, but no updates yet.

Guys, when you turn your board off, turn the remote off also.

Then turn the remote on, after the turn the board on.

The nanoX goes through it auto bind process averytime it shuts off.

The auto bind can be instant or take up to a min... i know thats annoying, when you just want to leave

The auto bind should only be happening one time.  Once it's bound to the receiver it should turn on instantly.  I am turning on the board and remote in the correct order.  I've let the remote sit attempting to bind for over an hour before... still nothing.

The receiver will go through the auto bind everytime it's powered off.

Turn both off, wait a good 10 secs for the bulk caps to discharge

Turn remote on

Turn board on

Wait for bind

I've tried that and in many combinations. None of which worked. Kind of a bummer because I love the size of this remote. The only remote that's been reliable so far has been the gt2b remote mod (Mad Munkey) from @FLATLINEcustoms.

If you guys decide you want a new remote you should check out the Benchwheel from MEB, it's awesome.  I have 3 of them, never had an issue with any of them.

You can also get it a little cheaper, but takes forever to shop from Alibaba.  Check out me thread on remotes.

Atleast your controller works, mine doesnt even powe on! The receiver doesnt power on but the transmitter does.  Its literally impossible for me to even use it! I thought they wont have any issues due to the fact that they delayed the shipment of the controller by like a month.

I thought it was my servo wire that is the problem so i bought i new one and cut the old one off my esc and soldered a new one. It still didnt power on. I plugged my newly replaced servo wire to my esc led card programmer to see if the wire works and it did. So im 100% sure that the receiver is faulty.

I have somewhat of the same problem here also. But i'm beginning to think it is the temperature. If my board has been stored cold (-10C) than the remote will not connect anymore to the receiver after turning the board and the controller off for a break. 
I'm trying to store it warm now and see what happens. If anybody has any other suggestions, more than welcome!
@Blasto This should work indeed but after this procedure it should connect almost instantly.

Ok guys, I've located the problem. It seems indeed to be the cold. After putting my board in a nice  and warm room for half an hour, the controller connected almost instantly with the receiver.. I've send this information also to Enertion so I hope to get a descent reply from them.

I've got it to bind every single time for the last couple days now if I don't hold the remote fully in my hand. I turn on the board, then turn the remote on while dangling it by the lanyard and it binds every time now.

And what is the temperature at your place? Here where I live it is quite cold now (-5C). If I try to let it bind outside then it will not bind, even if I lie the remote on top of the board for half an hour, no matter which order I use (first the board on or the remote). When I put it inside again for some time it will bind almost instantly.. No reaction from Enertion yet, if they reply with a solution I will post it here too.

It's pretty cold here. Today has been one of our warmer days so far. I leave my board in the freezing cold garage for the most part.

Alright, and it still connects? That is strange, at least mine wont do that. You could try it after having it in the living room or so for half an hour and see if it connects faster then. If so then this is proof for Enertion that they have a major bug in their product.

I moved the RX away from the VESC and issues are gone. I don't know if that's because of proximity to the VESC or if the connector cable needs to be straight (looped wire, induction effect?).

Maybe I'll try to move it further away but honestly a remote with this much hype and "testing" should perform at least as well as the gt2b. I put the RX right where the receiver for the gt2b used to be. The first time I turned on the remote it worked with no problems so that tells me it shouldn't be a proximity to the vesc thing or it wouldn't have worked even the first time. All I ask is for some communication on this from @onloop on the issue.

1. Email support@enertionboards.com
2. Prove it's faulty with video.
3. New remote sent.

95% of people don't have any issues. Any issues so far have been trivial or hard to pinpoint.

However, Will most likely remove the autobind function in next batch as it seems to be confusing folks or not working in some environments.

Going back to the manual method of using a binding pin seems a good option at this point.

I think most of the issue have been resolved with either moving the RX away from the VESC or replacing the RX > VESC lead.  At least I have seen 4 or 5 posts that were resolved that way.

I might still be a good idea to make it more 'dummy' proof on future versions.  Not that I am calling anyone a dummy, just a manufacturing term.  I don't really see a problem with this one as long as you have a decent RX lead and/or can move the RX to another location.

I have a nano-x and at first it binded up really nice. But now that i have the space cell mounted to the board, the remote wont connect. I think something inside is just touching the reciever pins together but i never had this problem with the winning remote. On the two rides I took the board on the Nano-x didn't disconnect while I was riding it. It just has auto binding problems.

@Funes There's a million threads out there about this issue.  Search...

Most people have found that either the RX lead is bad, the RX needs to be away from the VESC, or the tape on the bottom of the PCB is bridging pins.

You purchased a new RX lead, moved the RX at least 5 inches from the VESC and removed the tape from the bottom of the receiver (in the case)?  If so then you need to contact @EnertionSupport about it.

This is just to check whether the Nano-x binds or not. If the Nano-x binds to its receiver w/o the signal cable then you know something is wrong with your signal cable and not the controller .... 

Of course you need to have all three of them plugged in for riding the board.

Yesterday I took a 3 mile ride in 28F weather to work, and then about 300m ride to throw away some office trash, Worked great the entire time. I charged it up last night as I slept, and it struck me odd that it wasn't reading as fully charged when I woke up. Somehow the negative battery wire/lead broke away from the circuit board. Obviously it's the result of a lousy soldering job.

It's an easy fix, but I figured I would share it in the Nano-X issues thread.

I have the same issue. It did bind immediately and worked the first time afterwards. Ever since, I have to push the servo cable connector onto the receiver, and it connects instantly. I'm still in the process of building the board, and I'm glad I found this issue before finishing.
I did just send an email to Enertion support, but the video I have is too large to email.

jason also never replied my tag nor my msg...

i swapped the whole thing, still doesnt work
the safest way for me to make sure it work is to open it and reconnect if before i leave
then when i do stop, i only turn off the remote, i keep the battery on the whole day
if i keep the battery on while it linked perfectly ok once, it will stay linked no matter how many times i turn the controller off

would be better if i can get it to connect everytime when i turn on the battery though

I guess it's the Crystal o. The receiver that needs replaced. Seen a video looks easy but not 100% where the solder needs to go enertion wanted me to send it back but I don't feel like waiting on the turn around if they just sent a receiver with a return label that would be more ideal. It's of the quality of the product being made in the USA has such bad quality control.

Did it ever become clear why nano-x wont connect in cold? Mine connect at the same second when board and remote are in room temp, but in 10 celsius it doesn't. I wonder if i should buy new remote because 10 celsius is warm weather in here. I can't switch off my board outside because it won't connect when it's cooled down. Any idea @onloop

I didn't even have to prove it, it was a common manufacturing issue which other people experienced as well so they just send me a new one. It took them 4 month's though... Their customer service is the worst one I've ever encounterd but in the end they come throug though.
I would just send them an email and if that does not work send an email to this adres: Linda Stapleton <linda@enertionboards.com> she is the bussiness manager there, she got the ball rolling a few times for me when the rest couldn't do their job. Good luck!

Guys, have anyone had issue where the remote shows 'binder' with a solid green, but it doesn't send any signal out?
I have both the new and old receiver and remote, sometimes they connect, sometimes they dont, but no matter how many times I have it connected, it won't send any signal when I pull the trigger
I'm sure the motor is fine because I can run the motor detect perfectly, meaning there is power sending to the motor when I do it through bldc, but the remote has no respond.... I'm sure it is connected though, it gave me solid red on receiver and slid green on the remote

Help?

Are you plugged into channel 1? Most RC receivers use channel 1 for steering. The nano x is built for skateboards specifically. So the primary channel is the throttle.  Just asking and hoping to help.

hey there
i got signal going now
but idk why, when i pull the trigger, it goes full throttle
and when i let go of the trigger it just keeps running at 100%
and unless that i pull the break, it wont stop
when i left the trigger at neutral, it seems to give out 100% throttle
im not sure how to configure this XD

so basically the motor only stops when i pull the break completely
when i pull the break a bit, it starts to move (as if i pulled the trigger going forward)
and by the middle, where it is neutral, it is running at its 100%
anything after the middle stays 100%

can anyone tell me how to configure this properly on the bldc XD?

i kept tweaking with the Y connector i had for the dual motors and receiver
and it randomly worked.... but it was like half an hour of tweaking here and there, not really sure which part exactly did i made it run...
but im still stuck on it running at 100% without me pushing the throttle...

```
The switch that rests under length of your thumb changes the mode from super fucking sensitive to manageable
