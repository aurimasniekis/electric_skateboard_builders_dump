Hello, i will build a li on battery 2x 10S1P with 1 BMS for each one. like this picture :

![2bms|690x436](upload://kHoKIk5owUlwdp2nXmaxAaAvYAc.png)

The gold is for double the current.

and my question is, i need a charger with the double current (A), and this will not damage the BMS after full charge. the time i take from full charge until i turn off, will not damage the BMS?

Thanks guys

This seems like a bad idea, why not go for a single bms that is just rated for higher current?
