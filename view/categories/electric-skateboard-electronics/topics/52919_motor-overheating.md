Hey dear community

I have a Maytech 6374 170kv on 12S3P Li-Ion. Today was the first day where it was relatively hot outside (around 26°C) so i thought I take my beauty for a spin..
After ten minutes I noticed weird cutting off and braking problems.
I saw that my Motor always hit the 80°C Temp Limit. So I let it cool down and chilled my way back home.

The funny thing is - I also changed my motor mount to the eskating.eu carbon fibre mount yesterday.
I wonder if this could be related ? 
Anyone having tips how to fix my problem ? Thanks

Thanks for the recommendation.. but I think it's not the surface contact that makes problem - more it's the material itself that does not really transfer heat. I just wonder if anyone else is having similar problems

It's strong as fuk - but yeah.. seems it doesn't handle CF Mounts well..

Sounds like an alignment issue. If its slightly off, more friction will be caused which means more heat. Try realign and visually make sure that everything looks(and sounds) as it should. Had similiar issue with one of my first motor mounts that i made in metal shop in uni. axles wasnt perfectly parallell

Thanks - but I think with my setup - I shouldn't be having heat issues in the first place. I chose a high voltage 12S with low KV Motor so that I will never run into these kinds of problems :frowning:

Spin the wheel without the motor being powered and see if it still gets hot.  I also suspect it's a belt alignment problem.  Does the belt itself get hot?

The alignment should be ok. I checked it to the best of my abilities. Also the belt will not run to one side of the pulley and stay centered which means it should be aligned quite well. I also use a idler pulley and the belt tension is medium. But granted - it might be on on the tighter side compared to what I have seen on the forums. I will try to reduce the belt tension - however with my mount I don't have much room - and I dont want to remove the idler..

Gonna need a Picture from directly above as well, need to see the axles and the belt in relation from eachother. Not sure how much strain the idler does if it's not aligned properly but could be the culprit.
easiest way to see it is if you look directly from above while running the motor.

Another thing that can cause your motor to overheating is running the motor max current too high with 12s voltage 
And it does make sense that an aluminum mount would help by acting as a heat sink.

```
My Motor Max current is around 60A. But it barely hits 50A (only when I go uphill).

I think it actually might be the belt.. However due to my "lowrider" setup I don't have much space to move the mount around - also It was hard enough to get it fitting to my bear trucks so I cant really re-align the mount part that goes to the truck.
However I will try to run it without my idler pulley and see if it will heat up as fast just as sanity check.

If that works I might just order a belt that is 5-10mm longer.

With my old mount I was going around 40 km without a stop and I never came close to 70°C

I think it's important not to underestimate how deceiving motor peak power ratings are. Your 6374 170kv has a peak output of 3550w. I'm running a 5065 rated at 1600w and it gets _ridiculously_ hot after 10 minutes drawing only 400w. This is with everything setup correctly.

50 motor amps at full duty cycle is over 2200w, which might be pushing things to the limit.

I did some experimenting wit motor max current on 10s with 190kv (actually apx 170kv) 6355s 
On hilly terrain. 
60a
80a

I noticed a substantial increase in torque but also an increase in heat with higher settings.

Might also consider just using smaller outside diameter bearings to give it a little slack without losing the idler bearings entirely.

Yes -although those are already smaller bearings (not 608) but now I changed the mount slightly so I can adjust the tension better.

Here are some pics of the belt tension now - i reduced it quite a bit. If I reduce it more then the Idler will not have much of work to do.

So I made the test run now with the loosened belt.. It was a little bit better.. however it is also not as hot as yesterday. I have the feeling that the heatsink effect of a metal mount would really benefit me..
Today the motor hit a maximum of 75°C tried to go at max speed for a longer period.. smaller hills and stuff.. so the 20km ride was completed without any errors.

But I think as soon as I change to MBS All terrain wheels and really start climbing I will surely run into trouble.

you might have to go dual diagonal if you don't want to stress one ESC and motor too much. 

You could attatch to the back side of the outrunner a 3D printed fan to cool the motor.

Also in the picture it looks like the mount is a little bit misaligned, don’t know if just on the photo 

Also you are right about the heatsink effect or the mount and hanger, mine get pretty hot, the same temperature as the motor, I’m pretty sure that without this I wouldn’t be able to run the currents I use

I can only use a metal 90° angle and check alignment compared to the wheel etc.
Also I look if the belt is drifting to one or the other side.. If i put the belt in the middle on both pulleys and accelerate and it stays in the middle - i am pretty confident that the alignment should be ok.
Also the belt doesn't get hot or anything and I can easily turn the wheel by hand and don't feel much resistance.

In the worst case I will have to make the Carbon Fiber part in steel - allthough I would prefer to keep the CF because it looks nice and I already got the idler pulley and everything made for it :confused:

So.. one question.. I went for a ride again when it was hotter - and the same problems came up.. motor overheated and I had to ride back home at very low speed.
The belt tension was reduced and the alignment was OK so it didn't fix the problem.

What is the agreed upon maximum Temperature that I can set inside the VESC for the motor ? Can I increase it a little bit ? Standard is 80 °C and 100 °C Cutoff.

Thanks

the epoxy coating of the windings is usually rated for 140 Deg (asked one professor at my uni), so I guess that you could set them a bit higher. But I would rather look for other solutions like I mentioned above.

Yes thank you - but quite honestly the motor is getting the full wind/air as it is in the front - nothing is blocking the air flow so I highly doubt that the 3D printed Fan will be the solution to my problem.
Also I would not have enough room to fit that 3D printed fan as I already barely have any clearance.

I am just surprised why I seem to have these problems ?
Like i mentioned earlier I chose a 12S3P Li-Ion setup with a 170KV motor to reduce heat and everything.. yet I have trouble with overheating, it just doesn't make sense.

I barely reach the 500-1000W even when going full speed or slightly uphill so I should not even come near any limits.

But I guess in the end I will either have to buy another motor (like the APS 6384 that has a more open design) and/or I will have to make a metal motor mount to have a heat sink.

:cry:

how much do you weight and how is your terrain? How free does the motor spin? Do you notice any resistance?

Plus, how do you know what wattage you pull? Do you have any Module (Metr/Ack)?

Finally you could do FOC motor detection and measure the IR of the motor and compare it to other people with the same motor. I think @rich has 2 of them on his mountainboard.

I weigh 72kg .. I ride basically on special Biking tracks that have even surface (asphalt).
The motor spins easily - I can turn the wheel and don't feel any noticeable resistance.. Also the board will roll forever as if there is no drive train - So i think the belt and motor run quite optimally.
I have the Metr Bluetooth module yes and I run ACKMANIACS VESC Monitor.
The VESC although it is inside a closed enclosure will never reach much beyond 60 °C (I have heatsinks on the FETs).

It really doesn't make sense to me.

However FOC Mode doesn't work on my Maytech VESC it will always have a DRV Error so I went back to BLDC as I don't want to damage the VESC

no, they are true. But many are related to user error....

Do the mod, flash some new firmware (important) and at first set up everything pretty conservatively. 
If you stick to single-vesc put some heatsinks on the FETS and DRV.

if it works keep increasing the Amp-ratings.

It seems however when spinning and braking it up that the FOC mode has weaker brakes, is that possible ?

Just went for a test ride.. Acceleration and Braking feel perfect with FOC.. FOC feels like it has a lot more torque. I love this mode.. however.. even though its now night and it's cold outside - the motor got pretty hot. I even hit the Motor Temp limit again!
It feels like it's getting hotter than in BLDC mode almost ? Any clues.. I would really like to keep the FOC mode because of the good response

Edit: The Test ride was with 20khz.. will test 30khz tomorrow

Hey,

sorry to hear about your heat problems, as @bevilacqua mentioned I use the same motors in 150kv on my MTB with 12s and had no problems so far (and I'm not nice to this motors). Right now I'm waiting for a replacement motor because I crushed one but will monitor the temperature in warm weather end of next week.

To point out the positive, imagine your motor wouldn't have a temperature sensor then your vesc wouldn't reduce the power because of temp limit and could harm it.

There is one thing I recognized, your idler pulley is on the wrong side, it should be on the slack side. Everytime you accelerate you put it under strain. I don't know this mount but it looks like you could simply rotate the motor plate 180 degrees, then the idler is on top. 

When your motor gets hot, touch the motor pulley and idler, too for comparison. Is one hotter? Also not all bearings are made for higher rpm and can heat up quickly, the smaller, the faster.

Did you tried it without idler pulley as well?

Which FW are you running right now? Last year I experienced also differences with different FW's. I tried 3 and with one FW a motor got sizzling hot while the other just got warm.

But can't tell you further technical or electrical details because I'm no engineer (well yes I'm audio engineer but that doesn't help :laughing:)

You could also post some screenshots of your settings, maybe there is something wrong.

Hey Rich..
I am pretty sure the idler pulley is on the correct side (slack side)
Looking at the motor pulley - the motor will turn clockwise and my idler is on the top so it's correct
![Unbenannt|690x368](upload://neVHt9YcrHzzsqpXxcA6UEtmNmO.PNG)

In this example the motor is turning counter clockwise and it's on the bottom..
![Belt-drive-with-single-idler-pulley|390x326](upload://jSxdG6tjtRfl4joSYurSzNXK2wi.jpg)

The Idler pulley and the belt don't get hot at all.
Without idler pulley the belt will easily skip.

I am running the 3.101 Ackmaniac firmware.

Will try again today when it's getting warmer again

Everything you say is correct if the motor is regular mounted before the wheel. In your case the motor is back-mounted that's why it's exactly the opposite :wink:

Which temperature shows the app before riding? It could be that there is something wrong with your temp sensor. Especially when you say it feels colder, when you hit the 75 degrees can you still touch the motor?

Sorry I still don't get why the side it is mounted should matter.. The direction the pulley is turning should be the key point. In the picture that you posted.. imagine the motor pulley LEFT.. turning into CLOCKWISE rotation. Then the idler pulley is in fact correct :slight_smile:

Before riding it will not show anything.. shortly after starting it will be around 35-40°C

I just made this pic for easier understanding:

![Idler|295x500](upload://i6eoPXdqTN247OAT9PXjkVi2Coe.jpg)

Drive direction in both examples is to the left.
When you accelerate (marked in green) then you have the biggest force there (that's why it's better to have the idler on the slack side). Dependent of the position of the motor the slack side is on top or bottom.

Hope that helps :grin:


BTW I don't think no more that it has something to do with the heat issue but the idler is still on the wrong side.

Yes... I understand.. But my Idler pulley is on the slack side :smiley:
Just look at the picture.. the Pulley is PULLING the belt from the left side (wheel) to the right side.
That means that the Slack side (PUSHING) is on the bottom.

I just looked at the temp when turning it on and only spinning it very slowly.. the Temp readings look plausible.. so the sensor should be ok

This is too funny :joy: :rofl:

Your red arrow shows the direction when riding backward but not forward.
If you have front wheel drive you're right but I guess it's back wheel drive.

Move your longboard and watch the direction in which the belt moves.

Actually it is showing the direction to go forward.
Looking at the above picture the FRONT is on the RIGHT side.. the Board is on the TOP of the picture.
If you turn the wheel clockwise the board will go FORWARD.
My Motor is mounted on the FRONT of the board.

I am sorry but if you still think that the idler pulley is on the wrong side then further discussion will not help at this point - in my opinion it is correct.

Ok.. just had my first crash at around 35 km/h..
Here is what has happened..

I was testing the new FOC Mode with 30 khz.. still the temperature got up quite easily.
So I was accelerating a little bit faster so my Body was shifting to the front to counteract the acceleration and then suddenly the board stopped (not sure if it braked or just stopped accelerating).

I flew off the board straight forward directly onto my chest dragging for a couple of meters.. Remote control and board flew off to the left side.

After being able to catch my breath again I slowly went back home.
This is a serious safety concern now - I will try another motor or anything.. but I have to do something.. I can't take the risk of Cutoffs while accelerating.. Luckily its only torn apart clothes and bloody arms..

I think your motor is not overheating at all, on VESC tool you have the beta factor of the temperature sensor, probably the default value is way off, so the temperature measured is higher than the normal

As a rule of thumb you can hold the motor with your hand, I would only consider overheating if you can’t keep your hand indefinitely on it

I thought of this too - but then again why do other people with the same motor don't have the same problem ? I could imagine that the beta value should be the same for the same motor.

Also a small update - I changed back to metal mount but didn't really do much.. Maybe it's a bit cooler then before but still overheating.

The motor does really get hot.. but I can still touch it (but not comfortably).

Seems that you had a fault on the vesc. Guess you have a maytech vesc. Many report that they don't work very well at FOC.
For the motor heat get a infrared thermometer and check with that.
And the temperature sensor to jump around too much to my experience. You should check in the realtime data if it is a stable signal.
If it jitters then it is dangerous because it would result in a jitter power output once you reached the temp cutoff start.
In this case it would be better to remove the motor temp wire or increase the cutoffs so that they are not reached.

Someone said carbon fiber mount and motor heat..

Not saying this is it. But CF is conductive. Make sure your motor screws are not touching the windings. Will make a motor heat up in no time as your shorting the motor... Will also make it feel like it's always braking.

I already switched to a metal mount now.. But its not a solid one.. Its a 2 part mount - the steel part on the motor is conducting the heat quite well.. while the aluminium part that is on the truck is not really getting that hot..

Yea that's fine. But either way you need to ensure that the motor screws holding the motor to the mount are not so long that they are touching the copper windings inside the housing...

Here is mine...just peek inside the base and check all 4 screws

One more Question..
How likely is it that the motor blocked ? Because I really felt like I was flying off the board... but I am not sure what exactly happened.
Would it be safer to go back to BLDC instead of FOC since i have a Maytech VESC ?

@Ackmaniac I  run your firmware. A power cut due to overtemperature I had many times before.. but this time it felt so instant and so rough.. almost like the motor braked (but I am not 100% sure). So it's safer to go back to BLDC instead of FOC or does it make no difference ?

The maytech vesc is the same as the old 4.12 Vesc. Or even 4.10. They also let me crash at 45 km/h when one motor had a fault.
The reliability of FOC seems to be different for every motor. Get a Focbox and FOC should run fine or stick to bldc. And if you run firmware 3.100 then you should upgrade to 3.101 because a bug was fixed that let the brakes shut off when the temperature cutoff start was reached. But the didn't lead to cutouts during acceleration.

mine stoped working when I put to much stress on my motor, and the amp setting. still it was below 90amp. motor temp was about 80c in ambian temp of 10c. which is not present in focbox.

whatever the cause it acted same as yours, sudden braking.

I would un-plug the temp sensor and just check the motor with your hand. If its not burning your hand after holding it for 3 seconds its not too hot. Or show us some logs on a ride and we can see if its working normal. But it jumps around crazy on the graph above, but that is a very narrow temp range. It (might) be a reason for the cut out.  

If your committed to a single drive unit (rather than dual) the next best way to lower motor temp would be to use a lower gear ratio, ie slower top speed ratio. This will reduce the load on the motor and allow it to run cooler. 

An aluminum motor mount can help a little but it does not solve the cause of the issue.

Maytech vesc should not be run on FOC, might be the reason but the result is usually a dead vesc so I'm going with probably not.

I would like to keep single drive.. yes..
I already have a gear ratio of 1 : 2,6 so i think it should be ok.
I changed the beta value for the temp sensor so that it is now outputting "plausible" data - while not really 100% sure it now will show between 50-80°C and the motor is hot but not burning hot - which makes sense.

So the Problem that my board suddenly stopped while accelerating is not due to FOC ?
I still can't say if the board just stopped accelerating or if the board braked.. but it sure felt like I was thrown off the board - like the board made a full brake but I can't really recall it 100% it happened too fast.

I was looking into the logs but I cant really find the Log where the crash happened because on this day I made many tests with accelerating and braking (to see how the motor is heating up on acceleration and braking) so the graphs look all the same

Edit: What is the beta value of the motor thermistor that you guys use ? Mine was set to around 3200k and currently I changed it to 3900k - which gives more plausible values

Well if we are getting into it, show us screen caps of all your vesc settings. Some other setting may be off. Sure we can help with that. 

50-80 deg if true is pretty nominal. Lower is nicer of cause. 
While your gear ratio might be considered pretty standard. How hot the motor gets can also be related to your weight, hill, how much your accelerating etc. So a lower ratio will always make it run cooler, with the added benefit of better acceleration and stronger brakes. The only downside is less top speed.

Have a look back at post #28, not sure you checked that. You changed one thing and *probably* introduced a serious problem as you found out. Go back to what changed and identify what was introduced. I could be wrong on that point but it seems you were happy with a normal functioning board before the mount change.

Conincidence is an unlikely bedfellow

two possibilities could feasibly be intrioduced by this change
i) carbon conductivity
ii)m4 motor bolts are now too long, causing a short with the motor windings
(iii) Both (i) and (ii)

It's nothing really. A circlips plier is a great help otherwise you may need to be a bit more careful and swear some with a tiny flat tip, careful not to break it circlips can be delicate. Asides from that allen keys which you have no doubt.

Just keep the order of the washers the same. The bell can be difficult to pull off depending on the size of the motor, bigger the motor, bigger the magentic pull.

It's a big ass motor, don't forget to get a 10mm ID motor pulley as well. That is the one problem with APS, you geta very nice motor but all those cheap aluminium motor pulleys are made for 8mm ID

I don't think the problem with the motor getting hot is due to the vesc settings but maybe have a backup plan for that too, motors get hot beacuse they work outside their ideal range or have a physical problem or are run in a very hot place.

Get the 6384S (s for sensored). If you go dual in future a pair of those would be too much for any longboard and they weigh almost 1kg...they are good for dual on a MTB

That sounds like only two Phase wires are connected to the VESC and one came loose. The described behaviour happens when i unplug one bullet connector of the Phase wires!

Maybe send your vesc to someone who wants to test it for you. Shipping costs and beermoney is much less then a new vesc.
If you´re from US, send it to @ThermalM16 or up north to @JohnnyMeduse. I´m sure they can both take a look, test it and they both repair it if something is faulty.
If you´re from EU, send it to me, I can test it too of course :slight_smile:

I am from Austria / Europe.. I have a couple of spare DRV chips here.. so If I knew its the DRV i could replace it..
I just tested the continuity of the Hall Sensor Cable of the motor.. everything looks fine from the connector straight to the PCB inside the motor..
Not sure what else I could test

Edit: Also I shorted the 3 phase cables and tested each and they all give higher resistance to the motor when trying to turn it.. so that should also be ok..

Thank you that is very kind.. Where are you located ?
After reassembly of the Motor and motor detection on the vesc I took another test run.
This time the problem did not show up ?

I made a video of a super super steep hill - one video is uphill - one is downhill and another one is at home just turning the motor.

Anything suspicious (except the skipping belt - don't know why it skips even though I have a idler pulley and proper tension..) ?

EDIT: Sorry - someone wrote me a message while screencapturing - but you can see motor current so it should be ok..

That motor looks ok to me but I'm no expert, I see a couple of what looks to be rub marks on the magents, not entirely sure they are to be expected, motor experts?

That's a really nice offer from @TarzanHBK. I also recommend @Martinsp for commerical vesc repairs

The skipping could be contributing to heat. If your idler is definietly not moving and trnsion is set correct then either the belt is worn or a wrong tooth size on one of the pulleys or belt

belts should not skip like that at all

The belt only skips when really going extreme uphill or downhill - but yes currently I am running a cheap chinese belt for testing. I have a proper one (Strongbelt premium) as a spare part here.

The thing is that on my test ride today when the VESC was working I didn't get any errors.
Funnily the VESC also didn't write any errors when it was clogging around and braking.. so I am not sure.

How likely is it that it is working sometimes and sometimes not ? I guess the MOSFETs are ok or it wouldnt work at all. Not sure for DRV behavior though if something like this is possible ?

Just took a 10km Ride.. no error.. normal behavior.. how is this possible ?
The only thing I did was open the motor.. then reconnect the motor and because I couldn't remember which phase I put where I did the detection again and the strange behavior is gone.. Don't want to take any risk though... :male_detective:

It get's as "hot" as before.. It never was boiling hot - but the temperature climbed up to over 100°C when it was hot outside. So probably the Thermistor is not the same as usually so the beta value had to be adapted ?

I wish there was a 100% way to test my VESC and MOTOR so that I can ride with confidence again.

Imagine you can measure the resistance on the thermistor at room temperature (or perhaps needs to be at 0) to see what the base resistance is and then find out what it's actually supposed to be (or if the software is just configured to map the resistance to temp incorrectly).  My money/guess would be that the issue is something to do with the motor itself seeing as how the measured max current doesn't ever seem ludicrously high.  That said only way to know for sure is to test the motor with a different ESC or test the ESC with another motor.  If you are ultimately pretty confident it isn't the motor or ESC then the next most probable issues are from the remote.  I'd see about taking someone up on the offers to test things and see if you can work something out with them where it's fair to both of you.

```
two things:

1. You should gt rid of the motor temperature cable or raise the motor temperature cutoff values to something where they can't be reached. Because they jitter too much. And once you reach the temperatures where the power needs to be reduced it will result in a gittery power output.

2. You should place the bluetooth module away from the phase or battery wires or if you have a carbon fibre enclosure then you should place it outside. Because you have too many signal losses. Mostly it is fixable by trying to place the Bluetooth module a bit separated from the other components.


And if i am not mistaken then the sound you had after a couple of minutes seems to be the sound when the hall sensor connection is interrupted. Can it be that it worked at mid and high speeds, and didn't work at very slow speeds?

@Ackmaniac
1. I already changed the Beta Value - Now the Temperature will not reach the cutoff limit, I didn't have any overheating errors since changing the Beta value
2. I have two bluetooth modules inside my enclosure and it's very packed. I can barely fit a finger inside anymore. But I will look to find a better spot for the bluetooth module.

I measured the Hall Sensor Cable to the PCB inside the motor and the Continuity was OK.
The strange behavior didn't come back as for now so it's hard to reproduce

Well the problem is - how do you get to high speeds when it will not accelerate at all ?
When it acted up with this clogging sound accelerating will actually brake the motor.. and braking (even a little bit) will do a full brake.
When pushing the board and trying to accelerate it will still brake.
Strangely enough - that behavior is gone now so I can't reproduce it

The symptoms do kinda sound like shorted phase wires or loose connection on the phase wires. 

Could we get some photos of inside the enclosure, and more specifically the wires from the vesc all the way to the motor? 

The insulation could be compromised somewhere. Or the bullet connects might have a dodgy solder joint, so the only way to check is to remove the shrink wrap, then re-wrap after. 

I also double shrink my bullets to ensure they can not short each other.

Either one of my maytech motors or focbox had a cold solder joint, I forget which it was.  I just pulled it off easy with my hand like the shrink tube was holding it together.  Also if any of your phase wires happened to touch that would also be a problem.

Thanks. I will make a photo next time I will take off my enclosure.

As a matter of fact I know also dfouble shrink tubed everything and removed all of the old shrinktubing and checked the solder joints. Because everything is a very tight fit it might have happened that the phases touched each other, but considering that all of those connectors had shrink tubing on it already it's still unlikely to have been the main cause. 
However now that I put another layer of shrinktube around the already connected bullet connectors I feel a little more comfortable.

Many others using the same setup as well with less heat coming from the motors.  Was it always hot?

So anyone got any news regarding this Tool Issue ?

Also ever since my Crash I didn't have any problems anymore.. I was not riding faster then 30 km/h so I was not pushing it for sure.. and I also never changed back to FOC and stayed in BLDC Mode.

So maybe the Maytech will do this weird behavior (full brake while going fast) when some random FOC Error appears and that in Combination with my Overheating Cutoff made a real mess.

So I will ride with my old setup in BLDC mode for now - I changed the Beta Value of the Thermistor to 3900K and so my motor will never be detected as overheating - when touching it it's never boiling hot so I guess it should be alright.

Happy weekend guys

Before it was also not burning - but now it is better.
I think the pulley on my small 76mm wheels might have pulled the wheels towards the point of the highest force making the wheel and the pulley drift to one side when a lot of torque was applied.
I think thats why the motor got warm and the belt skipped.

So one more thing that came to my mind..
My Remote Control has a B Button for "Low Braking". It is a Maytech Remote (MTSKR1512).
I never used this Button before - but today I tested it.
When you press it the Motor will brake really hard. So one more scenario is that somehow while accelerating I touched the B button and that's why I got thrown off the board.
Not 100% sure if that's what happened as I usually never come close to that button when holding the remote.. but a possibility.
Anyone else have this remote control ?

That makes sense man. 
I have the same motor and the same remote as you and it happened also once that my motor did break during riding, but just very short and a little bit, nothing happened but that was scary. I guess I touched the B button as you mentioned.

BTW did you ever tried cruise control? 
That's so scary because you have to tap the joystick twice to get the control back. 

Meanwhile I checked the telemetry data and my motors and vescs had about 60 degrees C max (outside 26 degrees).

Edit: don't forget to charge your remote after about 2 hours of use, yesterday my battery was low, the result was when I accelerated the motors were spinning faster than expected and I couldn't break, after 1 second the remote shut off and the motors stopped spinning. This can be extremely dangerous.

Hey @rich ..
I use cruise control sometimes for carving to keep my board at a steady 20-25 km/h but no faster than that. Stopping Cruise Control can be quite a mess - I agree.

Never had my Remote control go low but had a similar problem - I accidently tapped the C button while it was in middle position which puts it into a kind of mode where it will not react to any controls anymore.. So i jumped off the board and my board smashed into a sidewalk unbraked :confused:

As far as the B Button goes for my Remote.. I think I fixed it :smiley:
