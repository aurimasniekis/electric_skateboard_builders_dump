Hello,

Some of you may also use LiPo batteries.

In all Lithium batteries we want to make sure we are getting the most efficiency out of our cells.  Whether your an 18650 person, or lipo - we want to see the voltage across all cells - the same.

Well - Recently I noticed that my 5S Lipo packs were not balanced, and the last cell in all my packs was/were always low...  Why...  Hmmmmmmm...  Well - It turns out that my charger had drifted (iCharger 208b).

[I found this post on another forum where this person gracefully and simply explains how to tune your charger.](https://www.helifreak.com/showthread.php?t=206753)  

Also, If your charger cell voltage matches your [cell meter](https://www.amazon.com/eHappyMaker-CellMeter-7-Digital-Battery-Capacity/dp/B01JOO3H5M/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3KNA6TAJDKDMR&keywords=lipo+cell+checker&qid=1553870743&s=gateway&sprefix=lipo+cell+%2Caps%2C160&sr=8-6) 

Then maybe it's a bad cell... 

Good Luck, Be Safe.
