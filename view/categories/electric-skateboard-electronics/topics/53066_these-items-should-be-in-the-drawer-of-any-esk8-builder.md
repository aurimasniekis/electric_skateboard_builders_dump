You all know what it feels like to be at 99.5% of a build and find out you need a 1 dollar part that will postpone the finish for 45 days until the stupid part arrives all the way from China.

Help other fellow members to make a basic part list

I used neoprene foam, it's a little more compliant than solid rubber. That can be a pro or a con depending on how it's used, but it's served me well. 

https://www.amazon.com/Pres-P8237RL01-00XOH-Neoprene-Foam-Black/dp/B01G382JD8

Another thing to add is a variety pack of heatshrink tubing. You can even get marine-grade stuff that has a hot-glue lining for completely waterproof connections.

Also get a roll of some good, name brand (Scotch or 3M, etc) electrical tape. Don't cheap out on this, it makes a difference if you ever have to rework something. The plastic part of the cheap stuff tends to harden, and the adhesive turns to goo.

Not links but tools to pick at your discretion

- good soldering iron
- good welder like @aulakiria Boss Welder
- heat gun
- ceramic tweezers, like InnoVape(great for building batteries and holding stuff, while being non-conductive and possibly shorting things)
- drill bits, namely a counter sink for cutting the flange seats of wood inserts.
- hex sockets  and a ratchet, to properly torque motor mounts
- multi meter. Check your voltages and polarities.

No it's OK, and a good tip too, just wanted to restrict the list to things you can't get on USA, things that will cost 5 times more than in China and things that take too long to arrive. 

Everything else can be purchased on any hardware store around the corner, otherwuse we will need to include solder, Flux, soldering station, bolts, griptape, etc

The worst thing about them is that the thread lock doesn‚Äôt stick to ,I don‚Äôt know if because they are made of brass the curing doesn‚Äôt work as well as steel/aluminium 

First ride using medium torque thread lock I lost 4 of 14 screws holding my enclosure

Them with high torque and high tolerance it‚Äôs holding so far, but you can feel that they are soft glued

Another great item to have is o-rings to put in some screws to prevent vibrations, such as the enclosure ones since sometimes you can‚Äôt really torque them enough without damaging the case

This is my 24-hole organizer from Harbor Freight, costs $3

My soldering stuff is in a separate case. A couple things I added that others might;

JST/SM 3pin/Dean's T Connectors (For modifying commercial boards/parts)

Spare Speed Rings (Skateboard Washers) I purchased this pack for the Prime shipping cause I needed them for another board sooner, but 100-packs can be found for under $5 easily

Was cleaning my bearings and realized it may need to be in this thread, though this stuff should be in any skater's arsenal as well.

Bones, Sector 9, and others all make cleaning kits usually for about $10. They are not necessary but they do help the process. You can accomplish the same with a plastic bag, but the bonus these kits give is when you remove the shield and clean, the balls won't fall out like they will sometimes do in a bag. (in a bag the balls can all go to one side, which is how you get them out/in. With a kit the spacer keeps the inner ring centered stopping the balls from coming out of their groove)

If you want the most clean you can do a full tear-down to remove and clean each ball, but a lot of times just removing the shield is enough.

Acetone or Isopropyl Alcohol (90+%) are cheap and should have on hand at local stores, and cleaning your bearings every 100+ miles is a good idea. Just do not leave your bearings in the liquid for too long or it ill cause them to rust. I usually do a good shake, let sit in solution for 30 seconds, then pull them out and dry one by one (+scrub a bit with a paper towel to get off anything caked on there if needed)

Acrylic conformal coating, because you need to conform and it's good to 120deg celcius.

![image|151x444](upload://j533wMYyQ9Rw2s4ZOiWM7PyKF7Z.jpg)

Edit: Just noticed UT coating above posted by @SuperBen, nice heat rating on that. They are not all the same some have different heat resistance ratings and some have a UV aditive to see where they are coated properly, the one Ben linked has a colour instead, horses for courses

You need to use the braided sleeving correctly otherwise it'll unravel and look terrible, in order to archive a professional work you need to use a hot knife.

You don't need to keep them without bolts. Of course they will drop if there's nothing attached to them.
I personally install those between the veneers.

On other hand, i have seen complaints on those ez-locks that they get also loose and doesn't tolerate much over-tension.

The ez locks will never get loose if you drill the correct size hole for them.  the problem is people measure at the thread and not the body for the drill bit size, but that's across the board on threaded inserts.  I've never seen one break when the hole size is correct.  

Also, using rubber washers between the bolt head and the enclosure, fr back pressure and vibration support is a good idea.  I bought a pack of misc sized rubber washers, 250 pieces, at a plumbing supply store for $6.  I doubt I'll run out for years :slight_smile:.

I also found this to be useful however, it won't help if there is metal rubbing against it.

Is much better if you don't use it at all and use heat shrink from the begining.

Heat shrink is preferable, but sometimes you can‚Äôt get the coverage you want or there is a sliver of metal exposed between the heat shrink and an xt-60 connector, that‚Äôs when I use the liquid electrical tape.

Just received a pack of these specific adhesive fish papers and they are great! interesting to see that the material is very similar to that used in automotive gasket material. Just wondering if anyone happens to know if the two materials are one in the same(sans the adhesive of course and thickness)?  I have a ton of it laying around in the garage from all the car projects over the years, would be great to use it up instead of wasting it. 

https://www.amazon.com/Fel-Pro-3157-Gasket-Material/dp/B000CNISM2/ref=ice_ac_b_dpb?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1532641268&sr=1-1&keywords=felpro+3157

I believe that they are technically both vulcanized paper, just not sure if there are additional parts to 'fishpaper'?

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XGWD11B/

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MRLJ93K

Upgrade version, this stuff is heat resistant and not open weave, so will resist dirt/moisture. Comes with self-fusing silicone tape to do up the ends. It's not as rigid as above but I think better for the motor phase/sensor wires.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MU7EKPC

Speaking of silicone self-fusing tape, this stuff is very cool if you can get it for cheap

A couple of recent additions to my toolbox. Beginning my other build with ESCapes which requires some jst tinkering. Picked up these to make can cables and JST-PH ends for the PPM servo cable. Can also be used to make jst cable adapters (probably won't for this project though as I will be swapping pre-existing wires) or to attach new ends to connections that have come loose. I think from now on I'll just buy connectors I need and make any new cables lol Gotta collect something am'i'rite

Amazon,  MG Chemicals Acrylic Conformal Coating, and silicone conformal coating. 
The price jumps around on the silicone. 
There's a urethane conformal coating too.
But the other two are the main ones needed. 
Normally $10-$15 each. (silicone is $20 atm)

I get them from eBay.  You can probably skip the Urethane one.  Get the other two.

The acrylic one is watery and can get in tight places.  It's very thin - you can put a single coat on a heatsink even.

The modified silicone one is a tad thicker and more robust and seems better to deal with vibrations and possible physical contact.  I would keep it away from heatsinks as it may act as a blanket.

Basically, I use the modified silicone one unless I have to use the acrylic one.  The acrylic one has a more aggressive solvent too that will turn any kind of electrical tape and similar things into a pile of goo.

Acrylic for - heatsinks, tight places where you can't get a brush
Silicone for - everything else
Urethane for - places fingers will touch (loopkey), where you need THICK

Acrylic & Silicone more "internal and on PCB" and Urethane more "external and enclosure"

They all glow under UV so you can check if you missed any spots.

It's a liquid ABS plastic that hardens when it dries. Great for patching up gaps in your enclosure where you would put the power button, loop key, battery display. etc. When it cures it's almost as strong as if it were a connected piece f the enclosure.
