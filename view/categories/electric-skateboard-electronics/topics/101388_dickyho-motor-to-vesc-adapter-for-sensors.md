I have purchased 2x 6374 170kV motors (https://www.ebay.com/itm/6354-6364-6374-6384-150-170-200-230-270KV-High-Efficiency-Brushless-motors/303074535503?hash=item4690a6684f:m:mUObW1iCo0TOBEwqaQQ1qXQ&var=602007163507) 

from @dickyho 
from previous purchases i know his motors sensor port is not a direct fit into the VESC port. Is there an adapter out there that will make it plug and play?

Thanks!

u could search the domestic sellers.... torque boards has em... sensor wires alone might cost a bit, but coupled with a purchase may make it more reasonable..... never found em on ebay....

no, but most motors are 6pin....ask him, he responds quickly.... but I have yet to find a motor (knock on wood) that didnt use these connectors... option B would be to run them sensorless unitll you get connectors... no biggie just give the board a light push like it wasnt electric and all runs smooth.

I had the same problem. Its not a 1.5mm 5 pin connector. Its closer to a 2mm 5 pin connector. I had Flipsky make a special one for me. It would connect but not keep a reliable connection. I ended up just cutting the ends and soldering the wires.

Here is pic of what flipsky made for me.

also here are pictures from his 6354 200kV motor, iâ€™m assuming the 6374 170kV will have similar connectors.![image|375x500](upload://aZLJUG6O3xT3to5rWVZ65gk5Bbx.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://2bSy1FhXWjVdMXxvV9qVwFScLLk.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://yZt8Lqxq8xp8MIz5fofrvkfn1qP.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://jFhVd18Q3t2im5DE6nDaryqZSaf.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://xhSAZXuAUEfEUzmsE2Y6IwNxj9d.jpeg)

I've got the same motor as you. I did not use a schematic. Just match up the cables in the same order as they would be when using the connectors. They both won't use the same color. I started with the black wire on both and went in the same order as the pins. 

Here is an an example of the flipsky connector

And this is the one from the motor
