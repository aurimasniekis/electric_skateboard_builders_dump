I'm trying to fix a bricked FOCBOX (uploaded incorrect firmware) by connecting to it using an ST-LINK to upload the firmware that way.

All the connections are correct but for some reason I can't connect to it in the ST-LINK utility.

I just keep getting a "Cannot connect to target" error.

Has anyone successfully connected to a FOCBOX using an ST-LINK? If so, could you please share how you did it?

DonÂ´t you have to replace something if you fack up the firmware this way @JohnnyMeduse?

Did you try to reset the st32? On the pin 7

Well if you can't connect a St-Link there not much to do except changing the MCU. :worried:

Yes there the option to reset it, and it connects again, tested.
I was flashing new firmware and the computer shot down in the middle of the flashing, I couldn't connect anything, no usb, no st-link, the only way to connect again was grounding the pin 7 for a moment, after that I could connect again to the st-link. 
This is what I did:

Iâ€™m the kind of guy that will rather pass 2 minutes changing a MCU than 30 min try to save it ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª

I should add that I have this problem with my other (non-bricked, functioning) FOCBOXES as well.

That's why I'm wondering if anyone has managed to successfully connect to a FOCBOX using an ST-LINK like this one:

I use seemingly the same ST-link, just a green one. Are you sure about the connections? You did not mention that you soldered on a header that is used to connect the ST-link. I dont think that VESC-X and FOCBOXES come with them soldered on already. 

Does the FOCBOX turn on? I mean do any LEDs come on? There should be at least one LED on even with no MCU soldered on so if there are no LEDs on, you have a short somewhere which means bigger problem than firmware mismatch.

Yeah, I soldered on a header. I have checked and double checked the connection order and I'm positive it's correct. I have tried powering the FOCBOX without using the 3.3V connection as well as using the 3.3V connection without powering the FOCBOX.

The bricked one has a blue LED. With the rest, the other LEDs come on as well.

If you have sucessfuly used the ST-link before than this does not apply but if this is the first time doing this, try connecting all 6 pins because in case you have a V1 marked as V2 you will need all 6. For real V2 ST-links you only need 4. Just to narrow down the problems since you said you can not connect to the other FOCBOX either.

EDIT: I uploaded an incorrect FW to VESC 4.12 once and it was turning on and connecting to BLDC-tool it would stay on 95% duty cycle all the time. I replaced the MCU which solved the issue so that might be the solution for you too. I am just not sure if the problem is in the FOCBOX since you can not connect to the other one either.

Thanks, I'll try connecting the 6th pin.

Double check your header pinout.

@RiGo did you ever connect  the ST Link to the FocBox? did you wired the 6th pin?
