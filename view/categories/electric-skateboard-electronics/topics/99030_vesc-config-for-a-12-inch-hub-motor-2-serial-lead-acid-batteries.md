Hi i bought this hub motor 
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1000001627224.html
and for the moment i will use 2 lead acid (12v 7.2 ah) batteries in serial with a 50A vesc

after a few test with the simple motor wizard on the Ebike DD hub motor option but it doesn't show so speedy (without any load, just the wheel spinning on the air) ... :C there is some elements to edit to get a better performance, it's gearless i have to put direct drive? and i have to know the amount of poles that it have or the vesc tool detects it?


Thanks in advace for any answer <3
