Hi guys, i'm currently in the process of planning my electric skateboard and I had an idea. I wanted to make the board a little bit more personal, so what I wanted to do was to fit in some sort of mini speaker to my board connect it to some arduino/circuit board and connect that to my skateboard battery. You make be asking why? I want my e-board to make the sound of an r2d2 or Bb-8 droid when I turn it on and off. I know it sounds weird but it would make the board more 'alive' .  I have to warn you that I am a complete noob on electricals and circuits etc. So forgive me in advance. I bought some cheap circuit board from Hong Kong recently. It has an sd card slot, aux and a mini usb slot. I'll try post a picture of it later when I'm home. I am planning to purchase to 12S 3P battery from DIY electric skateboard and I understand that I have to factor in the Voltage etc.  If anyone has any ideas of how to connect all of this up or point me in some sort of direction, I would greatly appreciate it! Cheers guys!!

I have no idea about the speaker but to power it you should use an UBEC or SBEC.

Thanks! I found a diagram on the Internet. Is this basically how it's supposed to be connected?

Just make sure you wire the ubec on the ESC side of the battery connectors.
