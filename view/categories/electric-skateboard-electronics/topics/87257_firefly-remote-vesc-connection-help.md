Hey,
I'm trying to connect my firefly remote, but im not sure what to do. 
![20190315_193633|375x500](upload://gW0bnedODECbSjgelaCux3fcvpX.jpeg) 
The 3 pin connector leading from the VESC to the firefly reciever dosent fit very well into the plug on the firefly, not sure if its supposed to go in there?

I know this is a noob question but any help would be appreciated. The firefly remote its self just has a blinking connection symbol, but the reciver's led is on
