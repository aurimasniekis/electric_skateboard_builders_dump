so i guess i should make a thread about my build so that there is an archive about what i did.

**Friday February 26th** 
i revived and order of 48 Samsung 18650 25R cells and, after 40 hours of testing confirmed that they are legit Samsung 25R cells.

during march i looked at all my options and decided to go with vape sleds to house my batteries because with this i have better access to each cell. 

**march 18th** 
the vape sleds arrive and i make my 10s4p pack.

**Saturday march 19**
built an enclosure that is way to big but hold all the cells in place.

**present day**

during my hast to get a test down my esc broke and i have been waiting on a new one so i'll update when i have a test down.

my test made it 500M before break-down so i think it should be fine as long as there is something the apply pressure to the cells forcing them in to the sleds.

Ok....I'm have trouble figuring out how big everything is...lol I need you to hold up a can of soda or a ruler lol...

It's my fault I just haven't held a 18650 in my hand .... Only pictures of those and sleds so it's hard for me picture how much space they would use....

Pressure...I can see that ....Foam? Like sound foam? That was my worry abt using sleds...any drops probably be bad....the constant rattle of the batteries probably would make something work loose unless like you said .... Pressure to hold down the batteries ...

Thanks dude....and he throwns in an old Zelda game....nice touch...

Humm that's is pretty small .... Kinda like a round Bic lighter...

If that's the box you're using ... You could make a crazy big pack.... 

Ever think abt using polycarbonate or plexiglass ?

I second this. While I really like the idea of being able to access the cells so easily, I do very much worry about what the vibrations will do to the contact points. 

@delta_19 when you get it rolling, take her for a ride on the sidewalk for like 40 minutes and let us know if the connections to the batteries have any troubles lol

to answer @Michaelinvegas i was gonna get one from bestbox2014 on ebay but that could change from now and then.

as for the pack i rode today made its 1km before my belt broke and no cells popped out then another 2k kicking and still no cells popped out.

just think about it like a toy or a remote that uses AA batteries as long as there is a lid or something holding the cells in place its fine.

I was thinking it would be fine.....we ain't dropping our boards on purpose or letting our boards hit the curb which would be really the only reasons batteries would fall out of a sled....
I really like the sled idea...I mean why else would they make them like AA batteries ...if they really meant them to be bundle as everyone does...they would of made the darnn things square...even oval to be able to pack them together...lol (not really)...I like the idea of easy fix or easy replacement...even of its at the cost of a little weight and size...

update now that i have some good ride time in

24Km on base roads (we dont repave roads we have PATs fill them in with asphalt) no cells popped and good balance between groups. so lets talk about the balance of the cells, its pretty fucking good i tell you hwhat.

the cells bounce between 3.73V and 3.76V thats a difference of 30mV thats daum good but, i have two at 3.96 meaning they didnt discharge and the 6 cells that are grouped with them at 3,68v so yeah i have a few broken joints to fix.

so yeah this works and it works good

this is what they can make me with their printer, its not as many cell as i want but it will cut me down to 5 pieces instead of 20.

if anyone wants any for their own pack i could talk with the guy.

3D printing is expensive for big pieces.  I have a sled for 24 cells that I put together out of 3D prints and then made a mold and now I can pour whatever resin.  If any of u want one pm me and I'll pour u one for the cost of the rubber.  Maybe 20$ for 90 duro rubber or I could do a hard plastic.  It adds compression and also flexes a bit with the board.  I'll post up a pic later today.

I've made a bunch out of differnet materials.  I need two but can't decide which would be best to use. I plan to make all the connections with just the copper pressed and then sink the cells in probably a clear rubber.   It'll end up a long solid brick with two wires coming out.

so fuck ton of ride time now.

pack still works and works great for the most part.

the problems i have had though include 
-lots of rattle from the case at speed on 83mm wheels, fixed by going back to 90mm.
-my solder joints sucked at first so i have to check cell voltage in trouble spots so i dont run them in to thermal runaway.

but the pros outweigh the cons
-bad cells can be removed and replaced in 60 seconds if i have a replacement.
-due to the current rating of the the contacts if i over draw (I.E short) it will blow like a fuse and save a cell or two. 
-fault finding is a lot cheaper since i dont need to slice open a heatsrink wrapper.
-it offers the safest most balanced charge possible because i take each cell out one by one and charge it on my 4 bay and 6 bay charger.


like this set up is great and offers so much there are improvement i can make and will make on my new build but for now its perfect.

Cool man! I'm totally inspired by your build. It's a little pricey for those sleds, but it sounds like the tradeoff could be pretty freakin' sweet. You could swap out to a totally different battery type, chemistry, or whatever  without changing a thing. Too Cool! I soooooo want to try this out.

Yeah def sounds really pricey but does save alot of soldering and worryin about burning a hole and lighting your li-ion on fire :fearful:

would be cool if someone started a product line of 6-10s ready sleds at a better cost ratio for the DIY battery guys like us

How are the sleds doing?!  I really like the freedom from soldering or spot welding but worried about the vibrations of my stiff board breaking connections. 

What's the electrical resistance compared to soldering or spot welding?  I've heard the best connections with the least resistance can be achieved with compression.  The solder tabs can't be made of copper because it's too conductive and wont build the heat needed to melt it with a spot welder.

Hey.  Been reading tons.  Great forum and great group!

I'm in the middle of my own build using sleds (8s3p).  I bought sleds (2 batteries each) off ebay and soldered each pack with high temp wire.  Something to think about (I'm trying it) is to use velcro stripping to hold down batteries across the middle.  I'm doing it for each pack of 4 batteries to stop bounce.  This still gives me quick and easy access while giving the strength.

I'm building now so I don't have pics yet.  The sleds already have slits on the edges where I can feed the velcro.  I'm also mounting the sleds with thin foam gasket material.

Anyway, thought I'd throw in my 2 cents. (First post!)

Wow that's huge. Do u get any dropped connections or rattling? Do you do anything to keep them in the sleds better or is it just the lid holdi them against the board?  Added capacitors? How bad is the resistance?


I've been searching for a good sled for a while but not much to go on

I'll likely get a 4 cell tray that I'll need to solder to make them parallel or series and I'd like that thick for less resistance but I'm thinking thick tabs would be good for compression strength.  Don't want to lose connections.  Will like tape it all down too.
Would like something like this:

I was thinking you can get some dual lock Velcro (industrial strength Velcro, not your typical fuzzy Velcro) and line each cell channel with a small bit of it (maybe 5mm x 20mm) and the same on the battery to keep it in place.

I lined the bottom of my enclosure with this stuff and my components are rock solid in there. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey.

Link for those interested: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B007OXK2L8/ref=mp_s_a_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1474078542&sr=8-7&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&keywords=dual+lock&dpPl=1&dpID=51k%2BVeq-1UL&ref=plSrch

Beware when buying dual lock, there are ones with a straight/parallel Velcro pattern which absolutely stuck at holding things together. The dual lock with the wavy pattern is the one you want.

Humm wonder if the sled and cell with Velcro would be good enough

Wonder if richochetting rocks will damage 18650.  Lipos definately I've found

just get a piece of poster board to cover it :stuck_out_tongue:.

With those sleds you linked, i think you can get a wide nickel/brass buss bar and glue it to the bottom of the sled and solder the bottom bit to it. Should work well!

Let me know if you want help with this project, id be happy to lend a hand

I feel it's pretty fail-proof using these as apposed to soldering.  Come round and see it in a week whe the parts are in jinra.  I'll probabl use copper sheeting under the sleds as u describe then glue the sleds down with a soft rubber so they can flex, maybe the Velcro as u say and a thin lid of fiberglass.

This:

Is what I want.  They don't show one for 18650 but I'm going to call Monday to make sure

Hours later and having read this thread again I'm wanting to just use magnets and copper sheeting and some anti corrosive paste.

How about getting the copper strips plated using silver or rhodium? Then you will not have to worry about oxidisation of the contacts as much

Good idea. Think I'll try some of this simple solution. 

The plan is batteries with copper sheeting connections(plated with silver) held in place with magnets, and duct tape to hold it all.

I have been searching for days for a way to connect 18650 cells without needing a spotwelder. Yesterday I found the battery holders with pins and today I stumbled upon this treasure (refuring to the thread).

H3rose what's ur plan?   I'm all in. Doing (50) 30q cells which are on route,  (100) 3/8x1/8" n50 magnets, and electrically conductive paste, but not sure on the ampacity of the nickel or copper strip and waiting on that.  Likey will do 12mil copper.

Woah this is so cool! So you still get good electrical connectivity? No concern about one of the magnets moving and shorting the entire pack?

Reading that thread I linked things look doable.  

There's a way to test the resistance of the pack and I'll do that when I first get it going and periodically.  From what I read resistance is low.  U can use really thin copper that's easily cutable with scissors.  Should be possible to have a slightly flexible pack. Think the bit of movement is a good thing from what I read.

you aren't worried the magnets may move? Also, what is the purpose of electroplating it?

I'll duct tape it all down too. I'm not going to bother electroplating I think and just use paste.  Electroplated to stop corrosion of copper.

@Hummie 
I found some holders on amazon with tabs that protrude from the case. I figured the easiest thing to do would be to take advantage of said tabs and solder wire between them to connect however many cells in parallel. Do this twice with 2 rows and then wire them in series and **boom** you got a 2s battery with how ever many cells in parallel. In my case it would be 2s8p or 2s10p.

2S? You won't get any speed with 2S, you should go at least 6S.

You also have to think about the cases, eventually, the cost of the cases will catch up to you and out-weight the cost of a spot welder.

I can't believe I spent so much time on that sketch and i didnt even notice what i was doing. Hahaha.
@michaeld33 You are correct. However I think having the convenience of being able to remove individual cells to chuck at people outweights spotwelding. At least for myself; I really dont want to invest in a spot welder even if it is a cheap diy one. While I have the money for parts I dont have the time to put it together. You know what they say time is dinero and dinero can be the difference between buying a small snack or buying 2 times your body weight of food. Or something along those lines. :sweat_smile:

How are the sleds going, im considering doing this for simplicity, would something like hot glueing the cells to the sleds help again them falling out? thats my main concern. thanks
