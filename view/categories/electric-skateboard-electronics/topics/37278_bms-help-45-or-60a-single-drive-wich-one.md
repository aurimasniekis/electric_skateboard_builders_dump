Have an option of both the 45a is 15$ and the 60A is 45, don't know if i will pull 60amps from a 10s4p setup with single 190kv motor 1:2 ratio, waiting for the bms for 20 days just to realize that i didn't even order it and now can rethink the decision, what do you guys think need your help thanks

Supower and BestTech are known to be somewhat reliable BMS-es. I wouldnt cheap out on them since they can ruin your batteries which are an expensive investment and set your house on fire, maybe im exaggerating but electronics break, but that is a choice to be made by you. Since you are using a low gearing ratio, i would use the 60A one, of course if your cells can take it. It is a pain to butcher a battery after you made it just because your bms cutts of when you ride. @Okami Found out he uses about 1600w on his single drive mountain board, so that may be enough for you. Depends on your expectations from the board.

I agree with @Rinzler
Don't go cheap when getting a bms to protect your battery investment.

Bestech is number 1 in my opinion
Supower also known as Battery Supports is a close 2nd.

I went with Bestech for several reasons.
1. you can order them with some customized settings
2. they come with FET heatsinks and have a peak discharge rating of up to 240a with a constant of 80a discharge and 20a charge
3. they have a built in E-switch that has been very reliable for me.
4. they have a balancing drain current of 126ma which is double that of other bms's including Supower,

No spent to mush on these ESC canâ€™t turn back.
No not cheap but a reasonable price one would be good.

45a discharge
[/quote]

You think 45a is sufficient for my setup are should i go with 60a,80A ?
