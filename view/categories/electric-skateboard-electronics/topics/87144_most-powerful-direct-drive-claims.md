Anyone can claim anything but what about the reality.  From what I’ve been hearing and reading the ghost motors cook up really quickly.  I was planning to do a test up the six mile mountain here in San Francisco comparing temps but people with the ghosts are worried they would overcook the magnets as they don’t know what temp they can get to before they’re damaged.   we could get to the bottom of this on paper and the bldc tool:

What’s the electrical resistance, actual kv, wheel diameter, and magnet temp rating of the ghost?

The new motors have a temp sensor no? if you find someone with one that has and explain to them that there is no way to break something they probably would agree to do it

They have temp sensors but what’s the point if it’s an unknown max ability?  I imagine the esc shuts the amps down when it gets to a certain temp (what temp?) but that’s an esc setting and not the motors ability. What’s the max temp the motors can get to? Never seen that and will largely determine the continuous current ability.

But as u say people should be safe not ruining magnets with the sensor there

My Raptor 2 motors would get so hot on flat land on a cool 70F night that I could not touch the hangers with my bare hands. But never throttled power it just kept going.

Lol... If anyone has some extra motors, it would be @SeanHacker

Can't say they're not riddled with problems though... Poor guy hasn't had the best luck 😭😂

If I'm ever (un)fortunate enough to have these I'll run them till they scream and then post me cooking an egg on them. 

I swear on it 😂😂

That might be able to happen. Sometime when we get the time me and @DerelictRobot are going to open them up and dissect them.

O shit we could go down the direct drive are actually hub motors discussion again in a min ...but what of the numbers: elec resistance on the Vesc tool,  and the erpm at what voltage (kv),

from there we can convert to kt and figure the km I believe and then adjust for wheel diameter and we should have a theoretical model that would be accurate for comparison,no?  We’d have to skip the potential of heat displacement...@Pedrodemio 
Hell of a lot easier and more fun to ride up a mountain. I’m rolling today if anyone with the raptor wants to do a comparison just using a handheld thermometer

There's actually a debate about that? I think it's pretty clear what the difference is..

Hub Motor are Direct drive 

DIRECT DRIVE is a mechanical concept... Not only reserve for esk8. And imply a system that is drive directly by a motor, without Belts, gear, or any device that transmit power.

We as a community have already decided (or at least i thought we did) on the colloquialism behind the phrase "direct drive" on esk8 regardless on what it means for other industries. There are plenty of other things that don't "technically" mean what it would mean for other people or industries.

It is a concept... You can't use a concept as you wish.

And " As a Community" I think we educate the people the right way, and not making them dumber by wrongly using mechanical or electronic concept... How do you think people become anti-vax or flat earther.

That's a pretty fallacious argument Johnny. You don't see people up in arms correcting people about using the word "acronym" because they should be using "initialism". Language evolves and we have colloquialisms and conventions for that reason.

I don't see your point here... Do you want to redefine physic, for the sake of esk8? 

Here is a definition of Direct Drive

Sorry can't really relate, French Language make it pretty clear the difference between.

I don't want to argue with you Johnny. I will just say we do make a distinction on the subreddit for ease of understanding the various options for esk8. We had enough trouble correcting people thinking "Direct Drives" meant gear driven boards. I'll just leave this conversation here and agree to disagree.

Making a distinction  Is one thing... Claiming that a concept doesn't apply is another.

Motor like Carvon and other, shouldn't be call direct drive I think that name is even more confusing. They coul be call something like Direct Pulley Drive or something like this.

This isn't a forum about motors, this is an esk8 forum. If you want to be pedantic then here, I'll fix what I said.

Esk8 is about physic, electronic and mechanical concept for the most. If we intend to work whit them we must use the proper terminology.

It’s already starting to go off topic. 

The point is we need to know to which motors we are referring to. 

So you say direct drive then I think you mean carvon, elofty, or torque boards dd motors. 

You say hub motor and I think you mean hummie or enertion or meepo motors where the wheel is wrapped around a motor. 

If you want a word that combines both, then you are out of luck. There isn’t one nor should there be one since they’re completely different things. 

On topic. 

Raptor 2.1 motors reach temps of 67C with the current max beta limit in the Unity. That’s measured at the hottest spot I could find which is around the axle on the nut side. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/focbox-unity-support-setup-troubleshooting/77861/529?u=sayekim

Also the fear of cooking them is most definitely real. 
I told him just disable the cut off for throttling or whatever it’s called and he didn’t dare for this exact reason. 

He also said the old motors never had this problem which is I think due to that there was no throttling limit set.
