What do you guys do to check you‚Äôve made a decent spot weld? Tug it by hand to see if it comes off? What does yours look like?

I use a spare cell (I always buy 5 extras) and weld a strip of nickel to it.  Then I take pliers and try to pull it off, it will come off but it should be a real effort to get it off.

Cool. I can pull mine off by hand with some effort. I does leave some nickel on the cell, but my welds sometime look too hot (discolouration around the weld). I‚Äôm using a car battery with a digital delay timer, something that I‚Äôve thrown together. it‚Äôs not the best for consistency. I ordered some decent probes from Malectrics that have helped. How much pressure do you apply with your probes?

Tbh lots of pressure at a angle, I noticed if I put the probes square on it will weld badly, but your welder may be different.  My welder is also wildly inconsistent, its an arduino based thing.

A bit of discolouration is fine, as long as you are not blowing through the nickel.  If its quite an effort to get the strip off you are doing fine, but I Will weld 6 or 8 times and then test.  If you are just doing a single weld then it may not be strong anyways.

If the nickel strip breaks, and the small circle of nickel strip from the weld stays sticked to the cell, thats a good weld

Granted this is a nickel to nickel weld, I have always gone off the sign, if there is *small* burn mark around the weld your good. 

If the weld point is a hole, turn back you have gone too far. 

I use pliers to do tests. If it comes off by hand. Might want to increase the pulse length

Open to corrections on this

But also, do a test pull with pliers every time something is different. (Use a dead group obvi)

Edit: I know, This is super bad. I should turn down.

if you put that hole in it from welding too long, thats a problem. if it was instant and just because you had poor probe contact and underneath you were off the positive raised piece its fine. try and avoid it, but as long as its not damaged you have nothing to worry

You made a hole because you made the weld on thin air.
