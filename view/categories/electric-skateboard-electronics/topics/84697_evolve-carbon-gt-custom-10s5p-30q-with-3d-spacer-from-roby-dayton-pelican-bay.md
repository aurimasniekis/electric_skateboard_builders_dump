Just arrived my new battery from https://pelicanbayinnovations.com. I moved down my ESC with 3D printed spacer in order to put BMS on the top of it. WORKS GREAT !

I recommend this guy roby@pelicanbayinnovations.com
Who wants more details please ask me.

im interested in hearing how this pack holds up. Its always cool to have a new battery builder in town. 

I find it odd that on their site they display their welds as though they are top of the game, but going off of what the community has said there shouldnt be any haloing around the welds ![image|360x180](upload://yDXr3PgWOZOOtyeiopz73ckHzbp.jpeg) 

 and what looks like not cut corners on his nickle strips.

Be safe with the pack, and if any errors come up, send a report here, and a copy to the vendors email as soon as possible. 

have fun riding :vulcan_salute:
