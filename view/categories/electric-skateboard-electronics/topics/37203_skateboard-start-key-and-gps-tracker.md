Does anyone have a start key like a car key but nicer like smaller and more cool, its a nice idea and I might end up making one if I find some time, would be harder for someone to steal it especially if they dont know anything about electronics like most people do, also anyone use those ebay gprs trackers? Im thinking of getting one they are reasonably priced and you could hide them in the enclosure/deck

Reminds me of the computer I used growing up with keylocks. Has anyone done this with their build, it would be interesting to have one as an on/off switch, not sure these can handle the batteries we have though
