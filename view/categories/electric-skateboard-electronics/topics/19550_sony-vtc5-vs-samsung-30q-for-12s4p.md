I'm trying to figure out which direction to go.  Similar in price but one has higher amp hours and the other is rated for higher discharge (if I understand that correctly).  Best of both worlds looks like the Sony VTC6 but about $100 more

Sony Konion US18650VTC5 2600mAh - 30A

or

Samsung INR18650-30Q 3000mAh - 15A

30Q is the way to go atm. Also are they underrated are are capable of more than 15A discharge.
@PXSS can tell you more if you´re really into details, but for know you don´t do anything wrong with 30Q ;)

You do not want VTC6. They may look like the best, but only in the first 20 charges. The VTC6 degrades very quickly, something like 53% after 300 charges charge as compared to 75% for 30Q and HG2. Don't waste your money!

That is good to know. Was not aware of the degradation speed of the VTC6.
