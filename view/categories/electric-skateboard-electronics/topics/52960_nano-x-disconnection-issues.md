Has anyone had any problems with there nano-x controller disconnection or anything?

I've had it disconnect several times and I finally got my board out today.. everything was fine, then it started not responding.. then all the sudden my board just took off and got stuck underneath a car.. its crazy.. any clue on what would do this? Is the maytech thump remote better?


Also does anyone have a maytech thumb remote they can sell me? I'd like to get one asap.. finally have the board complete and want to ride

Thanks!

I actually experienced something similar. Turns out the connection to the receiver was vibrating loose.

Glued it together and haven't had any issues in about 50km.

I actually electrical taped it to the receiver because of the initial disconnection issues had me worried. It’s very snug and tight now and it still messed up.. not good

I read about people having to resolder parts to fix some QC issues. But also it seems Enertion are pretty cool with replacing them. Hit up their support.

I emailed them already, just waiting on a response.. how do you feel about the maytech remote vs the torque board remote?

Only ever used a nanoX myself. But from what I've read maytech comes out on top.

You need to change the vesc settings so it goes to 0 throttle when you lose connection

I’ve not had disconnection issues, but have have connection issues several times. Super frustrating. Seems totally random, just won’t connect...I’ll let it sit for 20-30 minutes then it will usually connect.

My disconnection issues were directly due to the controller not charging properly. Discussed in this thread:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/nano-x-no-red-light-controller-died-after-5-miles-questions-temp-fix/52286/18
I havent had any issues since charging while the controller is on.
