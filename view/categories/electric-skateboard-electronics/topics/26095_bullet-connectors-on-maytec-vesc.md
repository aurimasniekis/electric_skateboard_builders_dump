Anyone has an idea of the size of the bullet connectors on the Maytec VESC? 
The ones on my SK3 6374 are too small and I need to change them to connect it to the VESC.
I tried to measure them but it 's hard to get the right number.
Thanks

Standard size seems to be 5.5mm bullet connectors. 

Just get a bunch of them and swap them out if the part you have has something else.
