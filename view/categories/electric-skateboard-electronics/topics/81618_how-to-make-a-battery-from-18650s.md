There's plenty of info on this topic. I linked you to the search function. Search for key words like 18650 welding, battery pack etc. And you will find all the info you need. Search the thread before you start a new thread.

I think @Halbj613 means  10000mah packs, not one cell...

Btw: we donâ€™t like to see people who have only read about 40min on the forum to start new topics. If there exists already one. Please do first you research. If there is then, something you donâ€™t understand. Open then a topic...

Just do your research. Look on the web. Look at YouTube videoâ€™s. there is some garbage on the internet but also good stuff.

Just out of interest, your 10000mAh batteries are more cells or one cell?

no in multiple cells of course go them tested before I started using them
however is 10000mah enough for a battery

Itâ€™s more important which cells you use and how much they can output.
If you have a 10000mAh pack with only 20A discharge capability, than itâ€™s not enough.
Do you know the name of the cells in your pack?
Maybe you can upload a picture from them?

Get good at searching on this forum man. You will find so many threads that will answer all of your questions. If you can't find it, go to the Noob question thread and ask your question there.

Alot of the senior builders are in that thread and love helping out people in need!
