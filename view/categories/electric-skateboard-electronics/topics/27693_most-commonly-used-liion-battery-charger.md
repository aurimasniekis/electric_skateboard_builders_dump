Hey guys,

Could some of you experienced builders link me with some of the most commonly used 42 volt LIION chargers for 10s builds? I will be using a BMS of course so I am assuming something along the line of a laptop style charger! 

Much appreciated,

Marcus

You could use any 42V charger but I would recommend this one, which can charg at 5A.

Thanks man, I'm gonna try to stay around a 2 amp charger as it will be much lower cost. I know it will take much longer to charge but I'm fine with that initially..

Then maybe a generic laptop charger would do the trick? You would need to buy the appropriate connector though. 
Look on ebay, there are [tons](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.X42V+charg.TRS0&_nkw=42V+charger&_sacat=0).
