I've been looking arround for a battery management system which I can put inside my battery case (instead of using an externat charger like the IMAX B6) but there are lots of protection boards which dont balance charge the cells but are advertised as BMS and ruin your battery pack in short/midle term (they just stop charging the cell a 4,2V instead of keeping the same voltage for each cell during the whole charging process).
Does anyone know about any real BMS board (featuring real balance charge)?

The bms' from Supower and bestech is reliable.
Try using the search tool, you would have found out of this yourselfüëçüèª

I was checking them right now...
But how do I buy them (no buy button or shopping cart)? :joy:
And what are the prices?
Do I have to contact them or something?

The supower ones you can buy from eBay or aliexpress, however I have noe idea if these sellers are trusted. For the bestech you will need to contact them through their web side i think

Thank you for answering so quickly, I really apreciate.
Do you know if I can use this board
[http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-37v-42v-10s-30a-10x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-265.html](http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-37v-42v-10s-30a-10x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-265.html)
for 9s? There are no 9s boards, after 8s it skips odd numbers of cells :disappointed:

no find a 9s board you can't use a 10s bms for a 9s pack

I guess you are talking about bms WITHOUT balance. Just hvc and lvc. Not all bms have balance feature. Those bms boards are good only for stable chemistry cells. They kill your pack otherwise. Battery Murder Systems :grin:

And if I use a 10s bms for 9s I would have to provide 37,8V (9s) or 42v (10s) to the board

every single one of your cells would get overcharged a decent amount. no bueno

So which board and which power supply should I use por charging my 9S1P LiPo pack?

To the op. He thinks those things are not bms. Yes they are. Bms without balance.

I mean, because there are not 9s BMS boards in the SuPower website, would it be possible to use a 10S bms but only connecting 9 cells to it? And in case it is possible, should I supply 37,8v (for those 9S) or does the board only accept 42v and it disipates the extra voltage from the non used cell connection?
