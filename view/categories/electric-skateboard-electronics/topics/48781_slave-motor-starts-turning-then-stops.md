So my master vesc is running fine, by when I accelerate my slave vesc will accelerate for a second then stop all together until I give it 0 throttle and start again. I've tried changing the polls over and ran motor detection on it, when its doing the detection the motor spins exactly as it should. Any ideads?
Thanks in advance

Does the cable wiggle? Does the motor spin after you set up slave/master and use the computer to spin the master?

Cable is in fully and doesn't move. it was working fine but I left my board alone for a week or 2 and this happened.
Yes, when I run motor detection the motor spins as it should

Have a look at your receiver and remote. I left mine alone to for a week and the battery holder on my remote was loose. Changed the batteries and fortified the battery holder. Now it works fine. Try swapping vescs and see if it helps.

For me bldc tool is easier than vesc tool, but maybe that's just me.

I haven't been eboarding long, the controller seems fine
Unfortunately I don't have a spare vesc around 
Don't know if this is significant or not but I made the master now the slave and the slave now the master and still the same motor only spins briefly, they're both from esk8.de but one of them was second hand if that helps

Don't know if that would solve the issue or not as the newly made master motor is the one slightly spinning

Did you try swapping motors to see if the motor has an issue?

Sounds like the used Vesc made be defective.
Try running it alone as a single drive and see if it still drops out

Strange, I've noticed my loop key has got quite warm though, could this be the issue?

Warm loopkey usually means lots of current going through. Generally the less warm it is the better.

Try using split ppm but clip red wire from one Vesc.

Any connector heating up usually means a poor connection creating excessive resistance and possible arcing between contacts.
