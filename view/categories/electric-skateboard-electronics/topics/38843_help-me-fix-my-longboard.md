So I used torque boards parts in creating my build. I bought the 6374 motor with 190kv. I have three 4s batteries in series making it a 12s battery powering the board. I made a cheap enclosure so I could ride the board and make sure everything worked and wow that thing is scary fast. Easily could hit 35mph. I only could barely handle 26mph. I wanted to engineer a new enclosure that looked better and more reliable, and wanted an on and off switch. I got a chicago electric solder (cheap) and cut off the xt90 connector on my vesc and soldered in the switch setup (bought from torqueboards). In this process, I had a major spark happen when I had two wires touch and melted a connector. I thought this spark may have messed up the vesc, but after rewiring and soldering in a new connector, I got everything to turn on, and connect to my remote and everything worked. The motor however is not getting full power to it. I charged all batteries and tested them with a voltmeter and they are fully charged. Most of my numbers look good on the bldc tool when i plug in my board to it, but it will not detect my vesc. There is no fault code so i guess that is good, but the board is running like the batteries are dead. I need help with this!! I wanna ride! My guess is i need a better solder job done to make a better connection, but any ideas??????

```
You have one damaged a sensor on the vesc or damaged/shorted your motor

Even though the motor will spin fairly quickly? just not full power? @Exiledd_Top

Check the battery cut off start and end on the vesc, the spark reset the values of the vesc, which would explain why you canâ€™t detect the motor or have it running at full power
