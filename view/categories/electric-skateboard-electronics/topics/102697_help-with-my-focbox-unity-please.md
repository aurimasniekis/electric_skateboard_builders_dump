Hi Forum!

my focbox didn’t turn on since 3 weeks ago. I was writing to Enertion by website and through the forum, and I only get the apology messages for their delay. My last step with focbox, after months using it, was upload the firmware again, setup the remote succesfully and after a reboot, It dind’t turn on again.

When I press the power Switch, the led of the switch goes on for some seconds, and after that turn off again. I was looking the PCB of the Focbox, and no leds blinks there.

Is it possible that it is the firmware or bootloader? I was going to order the ST-LINK today, but **please** , I would like to know your opinion or some advice, before try flashing it.

THANKS A LOT!
