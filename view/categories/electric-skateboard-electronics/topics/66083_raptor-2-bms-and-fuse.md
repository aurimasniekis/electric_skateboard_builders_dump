Hi, Anybody here knows the amp rating of the Raptor 2 BMS and inline fuse? The BMS looks rather small, almost as it would be the same 60a BMS as it was used in the spacecell of the Raptor 1!? 

Cheers

Raptor 2 bypasses the bms, the fuse rating is either 60 or 70 amps depending on when u got ur board, the latter being more recently

Thanks, that's what I thought. Would be otherwise a pretty small BMS to handle 80A or more. The fuse is 70a.

The firmware on the r2 Foxbox only draws 40 amps total from the battery though
