Does anyone have a good idea how to get the 12V for headlights or similar things? Does a 36V stepDown module works on 42V full charged battery? Who got experience with that?

I have some lights on my board :slight_smile: powered form the 10s battery. 

I have such a step down converter with red pcb. Those with red pcb are better...
