Hi Omer, welcome to the forum. While I understand it Iâ€™d your first time build an electric skateboard we try and keep the number of repeat topics to a minimum. So in the future once you have done some reasearch and have a Build plan make one topic with everything and ask your questions there. It would be much appreciated.

You could use the 5s1p 5800mah hobbling lipos

I decided to take off the bullet connectors and swap them with xt60s, but the 8awg wire was really big for the xt60s
