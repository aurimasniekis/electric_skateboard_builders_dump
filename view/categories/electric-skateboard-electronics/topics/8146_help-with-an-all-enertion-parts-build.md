Right now I'm building an Eboard using all Enertion parts.  I've managed to mount the trucks and motor/pulley system so far on my 10 year old Luke Nosewalker I've recently brought out of retirement for this experiment.  It seems the only thing I've purchased other than all Enertion parts is the CANbus wire from Ollin Board Company.  

My apologies for my ignorance, but I was under the assumption that this would be a little bit more plug and play than I anticipated.  I've managed to get the BLDC tool to recognize the VESC but other than that, I'm completely helpless.  Is there a thread or group of threads I should refer to?  I'm literally going to need help every step of the way.  If anyone in the Bay Area would be willing to give me some in-person help, that would be even better!  

The pictures essentially show you where I'm at right now

Thanks so much for everyones time!  I've been longboarding for over 15 years and after buying a used Boost on craiglist, I had to make something more to my liking.  I would greatly appreciate anyone's assistance!

Within the first few seconds I notice my vesc wires don't look like they do in the video.  I get that it's the brain, and I mentioned that I got the BLDC tool to recognize it.  They don't have that female plug on the end of them.  I'm already realizing that there was no info regarding that.  By every step of the way, I do quite literally mean that.  Does anyone in the Bay Area have experience with building these that I can contact?

The point is that it's not a complete breakdown like you said it was.  I guess I should've anticipated just being made fun of when asking for help.  Just like the Enertion 'help desk' all I get is redirected to links with people asking the same questions I am.  I've been doing real long boarding for most of my life, I thought this would be a cool way to keep riding after my joints started giving out.

Oh man this will be a tough one.

First off where are you located.

Second, your missing a few basic parts

-3 pairs of xt60 connectors.
-some 12gauge wire, 1 foot of red, 1 foot of black
-1 foot of 10mm heat shrink

With this you will do a Y connections from the output of the space cell to both vesc. Heat shrink all you exposed connection.

Solder your female bullets to your vesc, heat shrink the exposed bullets. Connect to motors

Now get some 70mm heat shrink, install on each vesc and your receiver

Get a servo cable, plug in chan 2 of receiver and to your master vesc (you decide which on is master)

Properlly stuff everything in the enclosure.

I'll let someone else take the ball for the settings

No laughing here mate

U def need to lighten up....

There some peeps in your area and I'm sure they are watching this thread .... And your reactions are not really inviting ....

You've posted here twice dude ... No questions really just a plea for someone to do it for you ...

Read all I can say...there is not one question you have that has not been asked before...

I would be careful who you take tone with

I'm in Oakland, but I am building it at my job in SF near the 16th st. station.  I am willing to travel a reasonable distance and pay someone for their time in person.

If I mention these parts as you've posted them exactly to someone at an electronics store, will they understand exactly what I'm talking about?

By "a Y connections" do you literally mean just the way I have them come out of the casing?

Those little brass bits I have in the picture are the female bullets right (with the half crescent at the end) ?  I just solder them directly to the vesc and motor wires? 

Is there only one kind of servo cable?  Will an electronics store understand what I'm asking for?

Can I get a link for how best to stuff everything in the enclosure?  

I think I can figure out the setting portion, you're talking about the BLDC right? 

Thanks again for your time and friendly response!

Learn and read ....

This is basic stuff...if you don't know tha basics...you should have had Enertion or @longhairedboy build you a board.

Calm down you two. @Dilinski you seem to have some great parts matching together, tell us exactly what you were hoping for on this forum...For what I've seen you only need a Y connection from your space cell 4 to both of the Vesc's to get your build powered and running...

Wow.  Looks like an interesting intro.  Welcome to the forum @Dilinski.  I like your old deck - can see you've got some miles on wheels there.  Like you i got more into longboarding, then e-sk8 (after rode my buddies boosted dual+) - helps with knees that just aren't as happy as they used to be.

Nothing new here - but you do need to do some reading and start educating yourself.  If you lived closer, i'd meetup and lend you a hand (I'm in Seattle).  it's really awesome way to get around and be on a board!  

Besides the what's what you need to get read up on - the most helpful part i've found is looking at other's builds and seeing what you like!  You have a great start already and less work to get it all working together compared to a miss-mash of parts from several places, but a few steps to finish it.

Definitely recommend you get some wire.  I like the superworm and wet noodle on Amazon (convenient and reasonable $).  I'd get 12 awg wire.  Get some XT-60 connectors.  I'd also check out a simple loop key if an anti-spark isn't on your list.  The higher voltage of your SPACE cell will give you a pretty good "pop!" spark when connecting.  The simplest and cheapest way to eliminate (i think) is an XT90 anti-spark loop key:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-anti-spark-xt-90-loop-key/204

Do you have a decent soldering iron?  Any previous experience soldering?  It's not necessarily needed, as you can usually buy some pre-made wires to connect stuff, but they rarely are the right length you need - so you end up with too long of one (or several) and it just becomes a "spaghetti" mess of wires stuffed into your enclosure.  Making your own the exact length you need is really helpful.  Plus you get to practice your soldering which is a great skill to develop for esk8!

Welcome and GL!  ask away and we'll give you a hand.

part of this is a "little" research and is apparent none was done

Circling back on a couple of your questions - no, most likely they will have no idea.  It's not a super common thing quite yet (we're trying to make it a lot more common!).  The xt-60 connectors i'd get from HobbyKing or Amazon.  You'll pay more for Amazon, but get it a lot quicker.

https://www.amazon.com/Finware-Female-Bullet-Connectors-Shrink/dp/B01ETROGP4

10 pairs w/ some shrink tube.  

here's a "Y" cable - but unfortunately it's reversed (you need a single Female to dual Male plugs) the one pictured here is backwards from what you need with a single male to dual females:
[img]https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XXOM3hPtL._SL1500_.jpg[/img]
But hopefully it helps you understand what you need.  This will take the single plug from your SPACE cell  (which will be a female plug - into two male plugs - one into each VESC to provide them power.

Then on your VESC you need to connect them to your Rx (receiver - the handheld remote you have is your Tx (transmitter)).  You can run a split servo connector (similar to Y cable for power - just 3 wire servo cable instead) one to each VESC (cut power (red wire) on one as the other will power your Rx), or connect two wires to their canbus connectors on each VESC (takes a bit more configuration in the software/BLDC tool) - but also gives you traction control and couple other things.

@Blasto - thanks i wasn't sure.  So disregard the loop key.  build into your nice SPACE cell.

The bare wires on your VESCs - you need to solder (i'd also heat shrink them after to protect metal from touching and shorting the phase wires), the female connectors to match the R-Spec motor wires.

Thanks sl33py!  I will research and purchase these items and brush up on my soldering (its been quite some time).  Honestly I mostly just want what Enertion promised these parts would get me, 10+ miles range and just a tad more top speed and acceleration from the boost that I can make small adjustments to through the BLDC, nothing crazy (maybe later on lol) .  If someone has already done a bottom up enertion parts dual motor build on here, please direct me!

Search is your friend here Dylan.  If you go to the top - right next to your icon (round) there's the "hamburger" - options, and far left - Search icon.

Search - "Dual R-Spec SPACE cell":
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/search?q=Dual%20R-Spec%20SPACE%20cell

Quite a few responses and thread w/ this.  Clicking the one that looks really close to your build:
I like @E-Boarding's build as it's really similar to yours (with a lot of pictures to help (i'm a visual person)):
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/board-of-prey-buddybuddy-freeride-gt-eco-flex-1-dual-drive-r-spec-uber-space-cell-pro-4-mbs-all-terrain-wheels/6950

Another is @Chris604 's build:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-board-is-finally-done-space-cell-pro-4-dual-r-spec-rayne-avenger/7289

Some good reading and hopefully gives you some ideas.

I'd definitely get a good soldering iron and solder ordered up if you don't have an old one to dust off.  You can always use a lighter for the heatshrink, but a good iron for making connectors on heavier 12awg wire is really helpful.

HTH - GL!

Hey Dilinski..

I am the designer of all those parts, i can tell you that most of the work is already done.... 

in fact, most of the complex stuff that needs hours of research and pages and pages of reading & research can now be avoided....

making complex systems easy to use & "Plug & Play" has been my mission for over 2 years..... and i am 90% there....

Unfortunately the last few pieces of the puzzle are now in your hands and you need to work it out... But have some faith in yourself... you can do it!


I suggest watching the video below, it might help with the basic connection questions... 

**NOTE: you will need a soldering iron & some wires & stuff...**

Thanks for the encouragement and for making an awesome beginners DYI kit for newbies like myself.  I feel like I've watched all of your videos except for this one, I think I've got most of what I need and I'm fairly certain I can put the pieces together now.  If I can just ask, where do you get your wiring for the receiver, the female bullets, and the Y connector?  Or at the least, what do you properly call them?  I'd honestly just prefer to use what you're using since its all made by you.  Thanks!

the wire for receiver to vesc are simply called "jumper leads cables" search ebay. http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/40pcs-20cm-Female-To-Female-Dupont-Wire-Jumper-Cable-for-Arduino-Breadboard-/261750839971?hash=item3cf190daa3:g:~34AAOSw2s1UyJP8

i don't use "Y" connector i solder the two vesc together at the capacitor boards.

just remember there are 10 ways to do everything and none of them are wrong.

You should also do a search for dual raptors, basically the same parts as your build...made by Enertion, but with their carbon fiber deck. I'm sure there will be some pics of a dual raptor opened up, which will give you an idea how everything goes together. If you can't find any pics, let me know and I'll send you a few. 

Having recently built my first two esk8s, I know how frustrating the learning curve can be. Just know this forum is filled with great people who will frequently go out of their way to help others and share their knowledge, @Michaelinvegas included. That said, I found it helpful to detail my efforts to find answers via the search function when asking others for help. This lets everyone know what you've already read/learned and usually helps you develope more specific questions that generally lead to better/faster solutions.

```
there's not a lot of room in there, so my advice would be to use as little wire as possible. Figure out exactly where you want everything, then cut your wires to where they are just long enough to reach and solder them together. Heat shrink is cheap, but electrical tape is probably more readily available. If you use tape, make sure you wrap around the cable a few times, not just once or twice. That way if the tape starts to peel off you still have plenty on there to prevent shorts. 

If you don't want to solder, try to hunt down the smallest XT60 Y-Cable you can. Some are longer than others, so try to get the shortest one. Just know its going to be a tighter fit this way, but it should work just fine. 

and don't forget to post pics of your final results. :slight_smile:

@Dilinski

Maybe you should do a mono setup for now, for learning purposes and then upgrade later on, even though you have the parts already.

A mono will much simpler for you, less risk of breaking shit
