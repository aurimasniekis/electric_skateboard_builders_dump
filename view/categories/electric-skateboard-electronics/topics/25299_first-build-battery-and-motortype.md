I recently decided to build my own electric longboard and read a lot about what parts to use. So now I would like to order my first parts, but because it is my first built, I am not sure, if everything will work efficiently together. My question is, if three 3s 8000mah battery in series (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-8000mah-3s1p-30c-lipo-pack.html)  with the Turnigy G160 Brushless Outrunner 245kv (160 Glow)(https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-g160-brushless-outrunner-245kv-160-glow.html) would work or should I change my setup? My goal is to have a top speed around roughly 45kmh/26mph and a range of about 16km/10miles, but i would not complain about more.
My motor pulley has 15 teeth, my wheel pulley 36 teeth and my weehl size diameter is 83mm.
A second opinion before I buy anything would be great.  
Thanks in advanced :slight_smile:

I would recommend a lower kv motor since you are 9s. With your current setup you will get an unweighted top speed of 33 mph

I think he will be fine with that 245kv on 9S,.... I use the 6364 245Kv on 10S with no problems at all.
