There is also high quality 180mm but it is not cheap! Maybe a 10m group buy would make sense.

pi *diameter = circumference of a circle 
165 * 3.14 = 518mm
You got it from here..

I didn't want to have all the fun.

Shrink tube is sold in tubes. It's measured by the diameter. 

We know that 165mm, from a few posts up is 518mm around it. (Circumference)

We know, (because you said so) that your battery is 140mm wide, we can assume, that it's 

  140mm wide on the top, and 
  140mm wide on the bottom.
    20mm tall on one side
    20mm tall on other side
=320mm 


Truth be told, I'm not a big maths guy myself.

ah thanks lol makes sense ill know for the future lol
theres also a bms to fit on top the cells which is 15mm in height so thats 350mm in circumference..but is this accurate to fitting a pack as its not a circular shape but more of a rectangle

I shrink the cells separate from the bms

You can just about shrink a 10s4p pack with 170mm (flat) shrink wrap. 170-190mm is your size range.

I get mind from eBay I think :confused:

Choose the faster delivery option. It's not as long normally as it states...

http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/262542818185

I've just realised the size I'm using most of is 160mm!! So anywhere from 160mm if it's really slim to 180mm if you've not squeezed 'em tight enough ;)

150mm is too small for a 2 x 18650 wide, single layer pack... 160mm is the minimum that will fit.

You want this one...
