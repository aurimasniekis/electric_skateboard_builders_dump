Hey guys,

Does anyone know where i can get a battery indicator so it shows the battery % and watt meter all in one? My setup is 10s Lipo in series.

I'm using this one too, it's quite reliable and does the job. Cabling is a little bit tricky, but manageable: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/installed-and-tested-a-coulometer-fuel-gauge/1753
