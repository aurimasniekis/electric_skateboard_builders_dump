Id be curious to see if anyone has mounted a motor in the front and back of the board? My reason being is I have a custom motor mount on the back of my board that extends a little to far to allow another motor mount on the same truck. Im thinking about just adding another vesc, but reversing the phase wires of the front motor so it pulls intesd of pushes.

People do dual diagonal drive somewhat regularly. Especially before TB started selling 218mm trucks. Ollinboards production deck is dual diagonal drive.

Just search dual diagonal and a bunch of stuff should come up.
