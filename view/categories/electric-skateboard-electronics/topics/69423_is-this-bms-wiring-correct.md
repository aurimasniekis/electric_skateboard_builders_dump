Hey guys,

I'm getting really close to finishing my 10s5p battery pack with a BMS this BMS HCX-D223V1 (https://buildkitboards.com/collections/batteries/products/bestech-bms?variant=7201537687582) 

I have just about everything setup, but whenever I am trying to draw load from the battery pack I am only getting 3.0 volts. When my pack end to end simply reads 40 volts. 

I think the problem is the wiring of my BMS could an experienced battery builder verify my wiring? 
Thank you!

do you have the E-SWITCH  connected?

@hyperIon1 I do not. Right now its just got electrical tape wrapped around it. How should I connect it?

@Namasaki I will find an image that shows how I wired the balance wires, but would that have an effect on the voltage being drawn from the pack?

If you don't get the balance wires and main wires correct, you will fry the bms.

if its just two bare unstriped wires the bms should function without the switch. only if a switch is connected does the function work.
once you have it wired as you showed above and your balance leads connected, the bms should function.
and if so you should get a 40v reading at your t90
```

yes, disconnect the B- and connect your balance wires in order from 1-10 then reconnect B-

That bms will not turn on unless the wires are connected to activate the built in E-switch.
The E-switch also doubles as a reset switch if the bms shuts down in protection mode so connecting a switch to the wires is necessary.
Also, per Bestech, the bms has to be turned on for charging as well as discharging.

sorry, I didn't finish what I was getting to on not needing a switch, @Namasaki is correct that the two wires need to be connected, if you are not using a switch at the bms, and you are using a vedder or luna type switch

From what I have seen and experienced, the Bestech E-switch is much more reliable that most external E=switches. Unless there is some new super E-switch out that I don't know about.
I've been using my Bestech's for over 2 years without a failure.

Sorry guys I prematurely posted without having a diagram of the balance wires.

interesting, the issue I have had lately with the e-switch is when powering up a duel esc.
even on the simple rocker switch

Would this BMS have a push to start mosfet switch?

also,

I am getting a 40 volt reading at my T-90, however when I plug in ESC's i get no power, and only have a 3v reading.

After the T-90 I put an anti spark switch in https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CMYPZ6Z/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

And after load runs through it, the voltmeter says 3. Why do you think that might be?

```
if everything is wired correctly on the bms and you're getting 40v at t90 it should work unless your switch is bad. 
or pluged in backwards.

I don't think the switch is bad/faulty because once I connect the pack to the ESC's. Not even the ESC's will turn on.

Nothing is connected to the e-switch on the BMS. should there be two switches?

These wires are loose ![10%20PM|667x500](upload://4rMK0NpmA7P66nHS5KU1XdnqXo2.png)

connect them to a 2 pole 12v automotive on/off switch
use that switch to turn the bms on/off  and to reset it from protection shut down.

So I will have two on/off switches one for the BMS, and one for the anti-spark switch? That doesnt seem right?

```
you can put a rocker type switch like @Namasaki uses, or bypass by wiring together because you have an external one. 
the bms has a reset function time-delayed if it is tripped so the options are to have the function on/ off with switch or always on wired together. if you just spent 60$ on a luna switch use it

You don't need an external anti-spark switch with this bms.

Lol, well I already spent $60 bucks on it. 
So could I simply just solder the BMS on/off switch? and rely on the anti-spark for my on/off.

It's is possible to have a lighted switch with the built in E-switch.

The problem with external E-switches is they are prone to failure from excessive heat cause by the high current passing through them.

If I was in your shoes, I would sell it and use the one in the bms.

true for the old style 2-4 mosfet anti spark switches.  the biggest problem was finding fuses
now they are coming along with improvements

I'll probably sell it then. 

But I'm still confused. Can I simply put a two pole, on/off switch to connect the BMS e-switch?

Yes, just a 12v 2 pole on/off switch. 
You can get them at the local auto parts store on online.

Well sick. Thanks guys. 

I also bought a battery capacity tester to measure voltage, Correct me if I'm wrong, but I could connect that anywhere in the hot wires leaving to the ESC?

Note that you will have to set that meter for your particular number of cells in series to get an accurate percentage.

Personally, I prefer a voltage meter to a percentage meter.

Yep, I know. I'll need to set the meter for 10S. But Idk I kinda prefer the percentage display, just comes down to personal preference I guess.
