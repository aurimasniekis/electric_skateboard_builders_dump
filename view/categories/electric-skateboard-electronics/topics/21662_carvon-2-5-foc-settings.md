Guys can anyone share their screenshots of you FOC settings for CARVON 2.5  ? 
I have carvon single 2.5 with 10s4p battery and I tried switching to FOC today but the motor made this weird noise, so I was scared to test it any more further and went back to BLD settings. 

Below are the screenshots of what I have right now.
