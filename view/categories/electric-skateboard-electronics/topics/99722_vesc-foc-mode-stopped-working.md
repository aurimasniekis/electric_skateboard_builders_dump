```
I've been running sensored foc on 8s for about a year with now with no problems, then suddenly no response to key input when on the bench. Tried BLDC, motor spins fine. No visible damage on the pcb. I can complete foc detection, but get very different results for R and L values then I used to. R was 150 now 50, L was 37 now 29. No fault codes. Where should I start?
I tried another motor and another battery just to eliminate them as culprits, same results.
