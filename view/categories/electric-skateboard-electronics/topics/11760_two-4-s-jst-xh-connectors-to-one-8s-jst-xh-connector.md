Hi! I have two 4s lipos and i want put Cell Checker with Low Voltage Alarm on board, but i don't want to put two Cell Checkers. I mean one Cell Checker for both lipo packs. So how i should connect those 2x 4S to one 8S?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/7/27d0a2a1d95edda4b5b97d005c96980ad2580602.png" width="507" height="500">

Set up will be 2 x 4S in series and charging will be each pack separate.
So like this? : <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/6/6682ba1f2604ee5d4c3d0f181eb6a94565655ee7.png" width="507" height="500">

Is that drawing o.k., should i connect that way? Also if i want to put a switch for that cell checker, on which wire should i put it and what Amp switch? I think any small switch will do (like 2A), even some micro bullet type connector, isn't it?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/f/aff67a0f2a6bebcd97d8f510946dd40ae10b3f30.png" width="507" height="500">
