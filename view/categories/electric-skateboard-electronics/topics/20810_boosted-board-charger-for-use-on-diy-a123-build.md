Hi all,

My boosted board got stolen but I still have the charger and figured I'd use it for my next DIY build with LiFePO4 A123 cells.

Can anyone tell me what size and where to find a charging port that will work with the charger for a V1 boosted board?

thanks

I think Boosted uses barrel connectors design for power. You could find these in your local electronics part shop if you have one nearby.

I was hoping to just order one online but might check out my local electronics store if I can't figure it out.

Thanks for the suggestion.

Where did you live?

This was a suspicious board listed on eBay in the California area.

Report the serial number to Boosted. service@boostedboards.com It should be on the original box. 

Contact your local authorities. They can contact eBay and get info on where it went/where it came from.

All false info in this post of yours. 

They did go bankrupt. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A123_Systems#Bankruptcy_filing

They are not new cells. The 26650 cells have been produced since around 2008.

Tesla does not use them. They have a partnership with Panasonic and now make their own cells.

Boosted provided my my serial number based off my remotes serial number. I reported it to them when it was stolen. They also have the police report # on file.

Ebay said they can't release the buyers information to me :(. But will investigate the seller.

Get your police department to connect eBay via the report item stolen. They should be able to add police authority.

Well I really appreciate you taking the time to reach out and let me know. I had pretty much given up hope on getting my boosted board back but that would really be great.

After talking with eBay and my credit card company, it seems I don't really have much recourse. A chargeback won't be approved by and eBay said stolen items ate not covered under the  buyer protection policy.

There is also another listing posted by another eBay account  carola2vnzuela0.   Who's real name is Haydee Hernandez. And shows addresses   : 7014 WOODMAN AVE, VAN NUYS, CA 91405. Phone Number: (818) 468-8516. Email Address: carola2vnzuela@mchsi.com. As well as Location: 39418 COLCHESTER CT , PALMDALE , CA 93551Pwith the email address carola2vnzuela@yahoo.com but my guess is she is a mother or relative who had a legit way to get a PayPal set up or they may have been using her in for for some sort of verification pourpose like bank account possibly  I don't know but looking at the pics it's the same board. Did your board have light scratches on the motor mounts    Check out the pics in both listings  it's same board.   The women's posting is very uneducated as to what the board is. The new posting they seem to have done a little more research.   Because people flagged the first one I think she got her account closed.  That's why the new listing.

I'll do some more digging and see but the auctions up in  2 hrs.   If you get back to me  confirming it's yours I'll place a bid and send you the PayPal info that is requesting the payment.     
I had a board stolen too and I know how it feels so if I can help out  I will

Yeah I am, then dispute the charge with a chargeback and via PayPal and hope for the best but there's a good chance I get double ripped off on this deal. Cross your fingers. I'll keep you posted on it.

You can try and ask the seller if you can see it in person before paying, and then check the serial number or something.

If it's 100% your board, take the winning listing to the local police department and tell them you have located a stolen item. They will ask for proof so have your original documentation with you. Hopefully there is information as to marks on the board recorded in the report that will match the pics for extra proof. It's also a good idea anytime you buy something like this to make a inconspicuous identification feature on it. For example, I put a specific four digit number under the griptape on all my personal boards.

How are stolen items​not covered? That makes no sense. Stolen items are not even allowed to be sold on eBay. You can easily fight to get your money back. Your ​credit card should see that as a viable reason to do a chargeback.

Wells Fargo CC said that would have to be settled in small claims court. EBay said something similar.
