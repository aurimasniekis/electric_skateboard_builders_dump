Would it be bad to do 3x 2s 5000mah just for the sake of being on a budget.

no, that's pretty close to what a boosted board uses.  You're good.

For speed, try:
15T/36T-- 20mph
15T/36T--22mph
with 83mm wheels

6s / 5000mah your only gonna see 5-6 miles range
Better go with the 8000mah if your gonna do 6s
Or get two 6s / 5000 and put them in parallel for 6s/10000 for 10-12 mile range
