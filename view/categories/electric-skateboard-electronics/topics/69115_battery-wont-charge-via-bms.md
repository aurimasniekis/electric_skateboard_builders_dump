As title says. 

I have my charge port connected to my battery BMS via an xt60 and the board won't charge through it anymore.

It's not a faulty port because the battery will charge if I plug the port xt60 into the main discharge xt60!

Driving me nuts, please help!

The image with the hand is me charging directly without the BMS.

The battery won't charge via the small wire (BMS)

I think you will get help better if you draw up the wiring diagrams. Or at least have a clear picture of the entire wirings

It had work previously. I haven't used the pack for a while and now it won't work.
