hello people of this awsome community

i have bin working on my board for a few days now and i finally overcame a few obstacle's. But now I have a final problem that i can't solve myself. the problem is that can't get my transmitter to power the moter. only when I press the keys on my keyboard the moter spins up. I have watched a lot of video's on how to configure the ''app configuration'' tab.( i used to tutorial to configure my vesc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17CSl1iXYE8). but when i move the trigger of my transmitter the green bar won't move. im using a [my transmitter](http://Quanum 2.4Ghz 3ch Pistol Grip Tx & Rx System)
the red light on my receiver turn on when i turn on the transmitter( i think that means it is connected cause i did bind it)
if you have any tips i would love to hear them.
thanks for reading this 

kind regards Ruben<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/9/a986a3dfb6a68592ec35f4b8893167181fbedf73.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/4/84323bf52bc39b2b6194a4f9a8ebdae393f3b48a.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Have you tried all the different channels on the receiver? The vesc may be reading the steering channel, for example.

And also you are feeding it 3,3v. It needs ~5v

Well that's wrong. Look on the receiver you can see  -, +, and the signal symbol(just under the 2,4 ghz at the pin side) Switch ground and signal and you should be ready to go

No that is not correct. Just turn your receiver connector 180 degrees.. 
Zoom in on the receiver so you can see what I typed
