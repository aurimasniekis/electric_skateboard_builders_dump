Hi yall, I built my e board and it worked great! for a month :( I bought a cheap Chinese remote and controller and it crapped out on me. I need help choosing a high quality vesc and remote. My old Chinese beeped when it had a low battery how do I know the battery level on the regular vescs? thanks for any help I can get. BTW I would like to spend less than 120-150 usd. This is my current setup

-2 3s 5000 mah lipos in series (xt60)
-turnigy 6354 motor (4mm bullet)
