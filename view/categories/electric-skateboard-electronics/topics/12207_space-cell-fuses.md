Does anyone know what types of fuses fit in the space cell? I need to buy couple more and I'm not sure which exactly will work in there as there are quite a few similar form factors. Also, are there any above 40A that will fit?

40A ATC fuse, I wasnâ€™t able to find anything higher than 40A. I just removed the fuse.

Ditto, also removed my fuse. May (or may not) add one at a future date. I haven't found any compact 60a+ fuses though.

I don't run a fuse on my battery packs either
You could swap it out with a Maxi Fuse holder.
