Can anyone check if these settings are Acceptable. Running 10s4p 30q , dual focboxes, and 5065 200kv motors. I think Iâ€™ve got these right....

If I wanted to make a slow mode for when friends try, what would be good settings ? 
Thanks in advance!

That's good. Assuming settings per focbox. A good beginner mode? Try out some stuff. Maybe change to 10A battery max and 10000 - 20000 erpm max.

Check your motor max amps. It's safe to set your motor max and min to your motors rated max amp and negative of that rating for min.
