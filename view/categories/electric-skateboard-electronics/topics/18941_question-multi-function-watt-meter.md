Hey,

yesterday I configured my VESC for the first time with thank of some forum members :). Very stoked to get ridding. However with the new VESC the placement of the components is off and I would need to get some AWG10 wire and solder connecters to it to make the VESC and the battery connect again:

While I was thinking about this I thought I'd might aswell get a battery meter while I'm at it. I found this on hobbyking: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-100a-60v-multi-function-watt-meter-w-temp-sensor.html and thought that I'd maybe just buy this, since it breaches the gap and has xt60 connecters on it already. This means I don't have to buy the a voltmeter from alibaba,  AWG10 wires and xt60 connecters.

The question is: will it work if I just put this meter between my battery and vesc and connect it all? Or do I miss something that would make it so it doesn't work. I'm very new to everything electric and I've only soldered for the first time in my life 3 days ago when I needed to swap bullet connectors for the VESC.

All the advice is greatly appreciated!

Yes it would work.  I did something similar by soldering XT-90 connectors to this power meter from Amazon (half the price of the one you linked):  https://www.amazon.com/Tenergy-Precision-Meter-Analyzer-Backlight/dp/B017YCTRKK

However, I don't find it to particularly useful for anything other than bench testing.  I would instead recommend a simple voltage meter. Then get a bluetooth module and use one of the VESC apps to monitor data
