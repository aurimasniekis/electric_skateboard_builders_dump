Fets tend to blow closed... change the fets, it will live again

With a blower, i usually set the temp to 240 celcius (465f)

with a soldering iron 370 celcius (700f)

It's a torqueboard switch, it worked for months but it just stopped working as soon as I unplugged the on/off switch with the battery connected.
