I've heard some people were able to adjust the end of charge of these chargers, does anyone knows what components would be needed to get and adjustable end of charge voltage?

Post a picture please. If it's one of the aluminum chargers, it should be fairly straightforward to get it open. Most of them have a trim pot on the output side for adjusting the output voltage.

Some can't be changed. Open it. If you see blue pots you can do it. Usually the pot next to output is voltage and the one in the center is amperage. If you increase voltage you must lower amps. If you lower v you can increase amps. If you see 3 pots just ignore the third.

I'll open my charger today and upload a picture of the internals.

I don't understand why I'd have to increase the current when decreasing voltage, current is usually lowered automatically when the preset voltage is reached.

You are right. But afaik some chargers keep the amperage making it risky. So you must be careful on that.
Edit:if you plan to lower the voltage you are safe no matter what. I just recall a guy that increased voltage and kept the amperage. Since the wats were over the l√≠mits of the charger it fried in a few minutes.

Here is the opened charger:

Seems to be a very similar one, I'll hook a voltmeter and adjust the voltage al 50.00V, hope it works, I'll report back.

I remember reading somewhere (don't ask me for source) that the bms does its balancing once it's reached full charge.

so if your release voltage is 4.2, but your power supply only reaches, let's say 4.1v, then wouldn't that prevent the balancing function?

I'm interested in knowing this as well...i would like to use a bms to charge my cells, but i would also like to undercharge my cells to increase cycle life. So i am also interested in in knowing if the bms will still do its job if the cells are only charged up to 4.1v.

with the bms you're getting from me, I had the modules modified so their upper release voltage is 4.1v. so at 4.1v they'll be balanced

```
The SuPower BMS starts balancing at 4.15V

I use a variable voltage 12S charger. Usually I only charge to 4.0~4.1V, but every few cycles I go to 4.20V to ensure that the cells get properly balanced

Permanently modifying your charger to a lower voltage might not be the best course of action. Maybe you could add an external knob for the voltage potentiometer so you can easily adjust output voltage

I was able to reduce the voltage from 50.9V (4.241V per pack) to 50.2V (4.183V per pack), so I'm expecting this to avoid the overcharge situation on braking at 100% SOC caused by the BMS shutting down all power to the VESCs.

As I'm unsure which is the other blue pot for current, but I'd like to reduce the charging current to 3A, 2A is too low and 4A is not mandatory for me, for this test I didn't move current, I hope I don't fry anything.

Regarding the BMS issue, I'm using one from AliExpress that has fully adjustable settings, so I've set mine to start balancing at 3.7v. it'll waste a couple percent maybe, but it'll always stay balanced even if I only ever half-charge it.

My advice is get one of these, and charge any battery at whatever voltage and current below the max of your current charger
Max output is 50V, which gets you max 4.16v/cell on 12s and you can set it to anything below that

Here's my charge setup.  12S 4A CCCV charger with adjustable EOC.  It can be adjusted from about 42V to 50.4V by turning the pot knob on the side.  I only use 12S so this is perfect for me

I added a power meter to monitor voltage and current.  The meter has the same input/outut as my board and the charger, so I can use the charger with or without the meter.  Overall the system is very compact and portable.  It is not much bigger or heavier than my 12S 2A brick charger.

This meter reads consistently 0.2v high? Not adjustable. And that recessed button, grrr.. I've been meaning to glue something to it so I can reset the "energy" without grabbing a pen. It's awesome though.

"Cheapest" is not what I'm looking for.  I'm looking for a 42V (adjustable voltage) 1.8A (2A if I have to) Li-ion charger.  "Cheaper" only matters if I can find more than one.  That one above is not 42V...

@Eboosted there was a group but that when on a while ago and @jmasta 's charger looks very much like the one in the group buy! 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/10s-and-12s-adjustable-charger-from-china-groupbuy-worldwide/17287/177?u=ronny_cts

Perhaps we could organize a need group buy for similar chargers with adjustable EOC. I would totally jump on a few.

Yep I got the 12S adjustable charger from @PXSS 's groupbuy awhile back. Maybe you could contact him to track down the source.  I can take a picture of the charger's label if that is helpful

 I haven't modified or opened the charger at all.  It was marketed as 5A but my 12S version is only 4A (which is plenty).  I suspect it is just a 200W charger that they adjust for 10S and 12S ranges.    I honestly don't know why these aren't more common.  I'm not sure how I'd live without mine!

The power meter is just from Amazon.  Get the 20A version for your charger so you don't need to use a shunt resistor.  It has screw terminals for input/output.  If you want to make the charger work with and without the meter, the meter's input needs the same port as your board and the output needs the same plug as your charger

@jmasta did you charger come with the adjustable EOC knob? Did you added it?

The external EOC knob came like that.  I bet you could add one to the voltage pot on yours and modify the case to be able to access it

Or.... drill a hole in the case above the potentiometer and use a screwdriver to change?
