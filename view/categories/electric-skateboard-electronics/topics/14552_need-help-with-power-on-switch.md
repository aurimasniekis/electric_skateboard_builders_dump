```
I am currently making a new E-Board that will have the Carvon Dual 2.5V.
Batteries are Li-Ion 18650

Bat. Spec: ï»¿Max. 
Continuous discharge current: 20A
Nominal capacity: 3000 mAh
Nominal voltage: 3.6 V

I will have them in 12s4p.

So my question is which push button/switch is suitable for high voltage and high current?
The voltage will be over 44 volt and current maybe 50 amp.

Sander.

You could use an XT60 antispark or a vedder sparkswitch ( pretty sure @DeathCookies sells kit in EU). Or TB's switch.

The vedder sparkswitch looks awesome!
How does it work? Is it with a push button to start?

The mosfets act as a switch. You can use any switch but I think it has to be latching and DPST or something like that.

Did you get the V2.5 already? 

The V3 will be out on 3 months from now, do you know what would be the improvements over the V2.5? As far as I know the the V2.5 can also hold an ABEC 11 wheel

v2 and v2.5 need highly modified flywheels for the motor. v3 can use unmodified wheels and it has a different motor, possibly new trucks...

And for power, a anitispark switch is the nice way, i would still put a loop key in case something goes wrong, you'll have a quick battery cutoff.
