I'm looking for a decent vesc for around $100. I was looking at purchasing this one https://www.vandaelectronics.com/products/vesc-motor-controller-custom-cables-and-connectors
Does anyone have any comments on this? Or any better vesc ideas?

It'll run the 60A you can pull from your battery all day long and I don't think they get issues with 10s

They’re holding up well. They’re in my chill and long distance board so i’m not putting a lot of load on them, so havent stress tested them.

I got them from this seller but you can find even cheaper if you search for flipsky fsesc in the app. I don’t know how shipping is to the united states but i got free shipping and it took about 3 weeks
