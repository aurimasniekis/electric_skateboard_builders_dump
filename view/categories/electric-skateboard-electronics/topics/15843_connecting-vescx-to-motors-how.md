I just got my VESCx (total newbie here) it doesn't seem to have come with the connectors I see in other VESC that allow me to connect it to the motors. My motor should be in tomorrow and maybe it will just work, but if I need to order something else I'd rather do it now :) Thanks.

You will need to solder some bullet connectors to connect to your motor. Most local hobby shops carry these.

Thanks for the quick reply, you wouldn't happen to know of a tutorial that shows you how to do that would you?

No problem. There's tons of videos on YouTube. They're all pretty much the same. You'll just need to find out what size bullet connectors come with the motors you have.
