What size motor?

I've actually wondered why motor manufacturers dont use a longer shaft and shoot it out both sides.  Seems like a win win to me.  That being said, as Ive never done it, who knows :).  Is it possible that turning wont work correctly, since since both wheels will be spinning the same speed?

Yeah, it seems like that would be an issue but if you look at some types of cars with locked differentials they seem to work relatively well considering how wide the wheelbase of a car is. I think with the torque of these motors traction could be an issue when going around a corner and using any power.

I've wanted a one-way forever!  Guessing that only one side has the one-way so you still get brakes.  Carvon seems to have tons of cool shit coming out, but everyone I've seen posting says their stuff is either late (EMCX, etc) or had issues (EMC) or not out yet (v3 hubs, now this awesome looking thing?)

@NickTheDude I thought the same thing about turning and lockers, having owned a dozen or so Jeeps.  The think that might be the difference is the steering linkage on a car is very stiff and very specific in its radius, not so much with truck bushings.  I'd be interested to see how well it turns.

Hmm, that's interesting. Looks like two SK3 caps on the standard housing and an extended 8mm shaft. 

My guess it that a setup like this would be more prone to slide but maybe not since the wheels are close together.

Nvm, says it has one way bearings. Should be fine

Without any long term testing, it's hard to tell how it's going to perform. My guess is that it will be pretty hard on the belts when turning. Sticky wheels probably won't slip on the ground which puts all that force on the belts. I'd go with hard wheels and start drifting around bends :-)

Combining the one-way bearings with a mechanical braking system could be interesting. Would also be cool to incorporate the one-way bearings into the wheel pulley instead of the motor pulley. That way you could achieve insane coasting (basically equivalent to a normal longboard).

No further specs, I will ask tho. This could mean a cheaper alternative to a 4wd set up? More space for batteries as well, 2 less VESCS.

Need to know how breaking will work as looking at the video both wheels are running one way bearings.

I have had that idea for months, just not the money to actually get them made. Should have jumped on it sooner, anyway looks pretty nice ðŸ˜†

If so, I guess it is not possible to have two of these as a 4WD set up using only two VESCS.

nope, this is only meant to give extra torque to the hubs!

I tried talking him into a real 4wd but yea 4x vesc and battery that handle that really adds up!
Lever is just too practical sometimes lol

@Rob.Endless carvon noted that all the braking is done on the front hubs.

The only reason i would want awd is for the braking power and this has none. I think a typical dual belt drive with 15mm belts would still be better because it will have better brakes and better efficiency. As for torque I can barely stay on when the vesc boost kicks in I don't want power. And if you need more power might as well get two 6374 motors with a esc than can handle more current than vesc v4

I think the top speed is what this board is designed for. Am I right?

That was my guess as well @lowGuido. This was built for high top speed.
