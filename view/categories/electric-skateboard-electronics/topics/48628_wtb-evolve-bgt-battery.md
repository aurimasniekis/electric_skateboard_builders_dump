The evolve batteries aren’t very good. Your best option would be to hit up @longhairedboy for a battery mod to upgrade your battery to brand new 10s4p, 30Q cells

Don't discard your old one.

That's right. You need the BMS from your old one in order for your new battery to work

Yeah just send the whole board, i'll take care of the old cells. I need the BMS from them to do the mod. 

I have about 15 of those packs now, i'll probably garage sale them. They're shit cells for eskates but i imagine other things might benefit. For example, Razor scooters or Power Wheels.

Those would make a cool powerwall or something, or make a trailer you tow behind a skateboard that's an extra 150Ah for those times when you just have to ride 200 miles

or make a beer cooler with some peltier junctions

You probably have to send it to Evole for them to "fix" it
