XT90-S hobbyking theyre like $2 and to prevent sparks when connecting batteries in series or parallel prevents damaging to your expensive components

you can make your own, or buy an anti-spark switch.

It's used to slow the "inrush" of the current when they connect.  unchecked you get a big "POP"/spark.  Higher voltages = bigger spark.  It literally melts/burns away a bit of the metal on the connectors each time it sparks.  So over time your connectors will wear out on higher voltage connections.  (8s/10s/12s)  4 and 6s will spark - but pretty minimal.

here's an overly involved and more difficult than necessary "how-to" if you want to make your own anti-spark loop key:

Best of luck and hope it helps!

Hey @Caleb1 - not sure if you are asking for a fully made anti-spark loop key like i made in the tutorial, or [ just a single XT90 anti-spark connector to make your own](https://www.amazon.com/XT90-S-Female-Connector-Battery-Charge/dp/B00RVM8U5W)?

Usually someone has one in the market area - either an anti-spark switch or used AS loop key like mine.

Quick search on amazon found a simple loop key (not anti-spark), but no AS Loop key.

If you can make your own, i also recommend one of the 3d printed mounts i believe @mmaner shared to make it easy to mount in an enclosure!  (nice work as always Sir!)

HTH - GL!
