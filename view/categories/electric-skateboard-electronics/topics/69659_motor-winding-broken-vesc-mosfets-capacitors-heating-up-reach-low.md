Hello guys! I have an very used motor (6364 random eBay motor) who worked great for me. 

In the last few days e recognized that my VESC 4.12 is heating up a lot(mosfets AND CAPACITORS) and my reach with a battery charge also decreases. After I checked all my connections I saw this:

One winding is definitely broken/damaged. Now I am wondering while the motor is still working. I also measured the windings A-B,B-C,A-C... they all have nearly the same resistance. Around ~5 Ohm. Difficult to measure because itâ€™s a big winding. 

Can anyone explain me more detailed why my motor still workes? And could this be the reason for heating up my mosfets and capacitors do much? I just run at 15A/-10A battery. There should happen a lot of heating going on.

Thanks!

same problem. Asked a friend, and it can lead to melting of the winding and damage the electronics. I can ask him to eloborate, but you can fix it or buy a new motor
