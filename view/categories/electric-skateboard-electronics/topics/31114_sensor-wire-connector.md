Next to our bullet connectors for the motor phase wires we still use the ugly 6-pin connector for the sensor wires.

That's the reason why I'm looking for a different connector.
I'd like it to be small and clean.

I was thinking of:

* RJ-11 plug
The female connector of an RJ-11 tend to be pretty big. :confused:


* [6 pin 3.6mm jack (like on your phone)](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/6-pin-3-6mm-phone-jack_60682486720.html?spm=a2700.7724857.main07.1.2bd13975UpoLQ0&s=p)
Issue here is, i dont want 1000 units lmao.
Also cant find the male connector :confused:

Any ideas ?

Microusb? I've gotten small quantities of connectors from amazon and ebay. Good for many cycles, but not sure how robust against vibration.

MPX? Six pins, robust, high current. Looks like there are panel mounts options.

I'm always thinking about connectors... I'll probably use these for the extension, when I get around to doing sensored.

Not to go off topic but there's this alternative to the bullet connector, MT60

There's also this waterproof 9 pin for phase and sensor wires, best for low amperage motors <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/b/6b8b65f0219f8b6e54370789c6520671ec706049.jpg" width="250" height="250">

I stil prefer the bullet connectors, reason why is because i think those connection points are way to close to each other. Especially for +40amps draw to your motor

It's a 60A connector, and heatshrink the soldered connections

voltage would be what you need to worry about for distance of connections. That said, there's plenty of space between them for 60v~, not to mention each lead is insulated by plastic.

Aha, and here u was thinking it was amps. Haha.
Hmm yea in that case.... ðŸ˜‰


Still in search for a good half sensor connector though

i'm still not sure what you mean exactly. the JST-PH connector is fairly small, are you worried about the individual cables? You could put them in some cable braid or another wrapping, looks pretty good!

Yes the hall sensor wire connector. I still find it to be to big. I found a nice print on thingyverse which acts as a riser and a motor bullet connector holder thingy. Everything fits fairly nice, only the hal sensor connector is yea euhm too long.

hm i'm still not seeing the benefit, it's all inside your board anyway. With your proposition it seems like putting a converter in there would make it even more unsightly.

Do you have a pic? This is mine..

You can see that the phase wires are outside, but my sensor plug is inside the enclosure, your's is outside?

[quote="ikjahaa, post:1, topic:31114"]
6 pin 3.6mm jack (like on your phone)
Issue here is, i dont want 1000 units lmao.
Also cant find the male connector
[/quote]

Those "6 pin" connectors only have 4 connections.  Ground, left and right audio and video the other two are for Jack sensing and switching off loudspeakers when something is plugged.  That's why you can't find a 6 pin male.  They don't exist.  They are the 4 pin male kind.  And that's one of the reasons why you can't use them for halls.
The other reason is. Never plug something that carries power through a connector that slides through other connections until it is completely plugged in.  Notice how the connectors we use always have pins one next to another and not in the same row?  That noise you sometimes get while slowly plugging in your headphones would equal a short in the 5v bus of the vesc

@Jinra I think @BoostedBuilder is referring to the 9 pin. I strongly doubt it can handle 42V 60A, I wouldn't pump more than 1000watts cont through that cable and even then for 20-30secs tops

Not talking about the phase wires, I'm looking for a connectorbto be used for the hal sensor wires. 
Even the wires coming out of the motor can't handle 60a, or am I mistaking ?

Yes, I get it... but the plug would only be connected when the board is off. 
But then again, what if the connector gets wanked out while riding .. hmmm... good point !

I'm seriously thinking of going sensorLESS hahaha

i want a small version of the Mini DIN used on the old PS2 keyboards. Its round and has 6 pins. but those don't lock in place with any real amount of friction. 

I'm on the hunt for this too and have been for a little while. I'd really like to be able to order my motors with a round connector and an adapter for vesc type escs. so i'll post anything i find.

I'm still liking the options i showed. Female micro-usb here, it's not too bad to solder.

Pretty small, if using these with heatshrink. And microusb is surprisingly robust, rated for 10,000 insertions, and has some retention built in. I'd still heatshrink the whole connection if using for sense wires...

You can also get them with housings, at least the male end

MPX is about the size of XT60.

If you wanna go usb, use a breakout board, sturdier
I use these when replacing microusb in noname random devices ;)
Also I think it would be possible to find a breakout board that matches the pin pitch of the PCB so you can just solder the breakout directly to PCB with pins or leads

My motors came like this and they dont have a connector for the hall sensor wires and so there isnt a way for me to plug my hall sensor wires into the esc
Does anyone know how i can connect it or where i can get hall sensor connectors

This would work for most boards. Probably don't want to use it for very high powered boards though.
