So after building tons of eskates, I have all my needs. An AT board a speed demon and a jet Spud for city cruising. 

But... I still wanted to build so I built a few ebikes for my friends and it was a lot of fun !! 

Right now the real deal : 

The legendary Moped , the motob√©cane M11 
![DSC_0305|690x459](upload://d6WLOaMevAyfwVqjh3HA3nhnL0g.jpg)

Tadaaaaaaaaam I got it for 150 euros. 

I have just spent the day removing the motor and all the parts that I don't need ! Here is the beast with all the space it has to offer 

![IMG_20180916_200302|666x500](upload://hKfI6OV4Ee9L1hIFV8q7oKbS1A4.jpg)

For now I think I will replace the old motor with a car alternator to keep the cost down like this one :slight_smile:

I don't know if I can use a VESC with it what do you think ? 
Otherwise any Chinese ESC from eBay will do the work but they are big so having a VESC would help to have more batteries. 

Tell me what you think :) all opinions on the project are welcome

That's a sweet little bike. I suppose you need to do that math and make sure the vesc can handle what you're demanding of it.

How much does it weigh stripped down like this?

I haven't weighted the thing yet but without motor I'd say around 25 kg 
I was really surprised by the weight actually, it's really a Mobike ! 

Yeah I really need to figure out if a VESC is safe to use, I know for running an alternator I need a 1500 w ebike Chinese ESC as I've done test before and it work like a charm.

I am as well unable to find the efficiency of a car alternator online, I don't know if it's worth it to use since I would assume the efficiency is not very good since it was in a gaz powered vehicule, but this is just assumption.
I might as well use a hub motor ( would be tricky to do ) or a mid drive, but that would require a lot more work since I would need to design a motor mount

Cool idea man!  You should look at what those arc 200 guys are doing with scooters.  Using brushless wiper motors and getting 40 mph and such with dewalt power tool batteries.  They've got a video on you tube which is a good watch even if its nots useful

I know right?  That was impressive as hell. 

I've been thinking about picking up an old sx125 and gutting it, install an big ass 80mm motor with chain drive and a massive 10s or 12s pack with one of the ARC 200 ESCs. 

It would be fun and street legal.

I loved the idea.  The esc is not all that expensive either when you only have to buy one!  My son has a drift trike that I have been hanging to power up for science.  Fun days ahead.  This carries on we may have to start another forum lol

Yeah, and 200a makes it's useful for much larger applications. 

I bought my wife a nine-bot scooter awhile back.  It's so slow and torque-less it just pissed me off to ride it. I may use one if the ARC 200s and a lipo pack, make it a killer-scooter or "kooter" üòÑ.

I would have a look at a video by Austiwawa on how he uses a car alternator to run his electric go kart. I think he use a 2000w ebike controller. 

If you were to use a vesc you would need one capable of running 12s or higher at about 45-50amps to get your 2000watts. A flipsky v6 with alu case might be up to the task

I have some focbox laying around I could use, you don't think it's enough ? I am planning to have a 13S battery ! 
I'll look forward for a flipsky !

Some update guys, during the last 10 days I bought a Shit load of parts, from new blinkers.. to a 3000 W motor ! 

Basically it's the list : 

1.72v 3000w hub motor with 17"x1.60 rim
 2.sabvoton controller 72v 60A ( fully programmable , comes with Bluetooth )
4.brake lever with regenerative braking  
5. 3,5 inch display for all speed, odometer, lights... Etc 
6. DC/DC converter 72 V to 12V 
7. Some  stealthier blinkers, head and tail light with led 
8. stealthier mirrors 
9. Feet resting bars 
10. Disc brakes for my back wheel since I will have a hub motor the original brakes won't work
Everything is ordered ! 


I have as well tought a lot about the design I would use. First I thought I would use the tank as a battery. But it cannot have enough batteries inside. I decided to change the design radically and modify the frame, then I'll sand everything and finish the parts with thermo epoxy paint. Pure Shiny black. 
Unfortunately I have no Photoshop skills so the results will talk by themselves when the project will be done :) 

The plan is to transform this moped to a motorcycle looking vehicle kind of like so 
![IMG_20180927_194357|666x500](upload://cx3EmrEPmD1GxaY0aV3teuFZOIi.jpeg) 
I will as well weld some side panels on each side with 1,5 mm thick steel with nickel treatment to avoid corrosion , cut these plates as I wan't to seal the whole body to place safely my huge battery and electronics.
I have to create a removeable panel on one side to have an easy access on everything but I'm not sure how to do that yet, I 'll find a solution sooner or later :) 
![IMG_20180927_183129|375x500](upload://upBtG4xeUNTV9wl1OaEYJU77ZQD.jpeg) 
Over these panels I will use as decoration some veneer design with some very tiny layers so it's not too heavy or too thick, gonna look awesome with pure epoxy black 
![IMG_20180927_183123|375x500](upload://1tFmhzbV7TNSXPY6hLTv5NYiIuo.jpeg) 
The battery will be wether a 14S15P 50.4 V or a 20S11P 72V 
I'm not sure yet. Will be a question of what is the speed I'll get with what voltage , can the mathematicians of the forum help on this ? I can provide lot of info and measurements but I'm not the best at maths ! 

One thing is sure tho the battery will fit easily, 220 cells of Samsung 29E 2900A. They're cheap and very good for big very large battery packs. Of course there's better but I don't wan't to spend 1200 euros on cells alone :stuck_out_tongue: ( CF/ RIP Sanyo cells for me ) 
![IMG_20180927_153257|666x500](upload://pm6ZbOhb0WBWz2OywtbwW121IqQ.jpeg) 

But I decided not to go cheap on this build in the end I kinda wan't to surpass myself on this one and make the best build I can make at the moment. And caring about all the details. 
So I will restore every single screw of this old thing to give it a new life and live the Pinnacle of our little electric revolution. 

I have already this summer did a similar build while doing my Carvon V4 esk8 it way waaaaaaaay more cheap but working very well so far. The problem is that it has a lot of inefficiency in almost all it's parts so I don't have a great range and the build is not very well finished 
A quick snap of this one : 
![IMG_20180919_175503|666x500](upload://5ER3qWGjIE2OX1Xg2f8iPAzlTtp.jpeg) 
![IMG_20180920_222846|666x500](upload://fuQBcrX9UwtsrTafRXrjtDIBXfo.jpeg) 
![IMG_20180927_184146|666x500](upload://wlvwg1fgCuNSptBh7gnYFNuvVsn.jpeg) 

As always if you have any question or suggestions help yourself :slight_smile:
I hope you enjoyed the read as much as I am enjoying building this one haha

@Nate I don't have the time to do it today. But I'll take 10 mins tomorrow to write this down. All the parts I have choosed. 
But can you tell me what you plan to do ? I can definitely help regarding what parts you should use for your specific config.
Share a few pics if you don't mind ! 


It's like Christmas everyday, got the new mirrors today !

Recieved the new headlight ! It looks so sleek and it's very powerful , I tested it last night my garden was like daytime ! 

I have messed around as well with my other electric moped , the first prototype , trained myself on the set up for the blinkers so I do everything quickly and as sleek as possible on the next one 
![15385739825358710251915474385369|375x500](upload://hTwup6Pf3qInw1PXXM2tHtcqDVV.jpeg) 

I have added a rear rack with removable battery so it's easier to carry the battery the current design was a wooden box LOL 
![15385740340933683950549292886652|375x500](upload://4IOrqOcB0XGNNM7oynazwztJDFu.jpeg) 

Next week end I will start the welding work : 
I will weld the two 22 mm steel tubes , during the week I'll do a precise laser cut of the side panels , then weld them on the frame ! 
Once all the welding is done and the metal finitions made I will take all the parts to a blast sanding place and have everything epoxy painted by professional  I wan't perfect paint.  

When it comes back I have to do the fiber glass work to fill all the gaps and apply the veneer on the panels 

Then it will be the funniest part, install all the electronics ! 
Hope to have finished the project by early November !

UPDATE : 

Almost finished all the metal work ! 
It was a long work and I had to basically learn everything while doing it. 
To say the least I am very satisfied with the outcome.

![IMG_20181205_161530|666x500](upload://anwf9WW94qnVw5PnHRwlRojIupw.jpeg) 

I am happy because the outcome is exactly what I wanted, I still have a lot of finishing work to do but it won't be difficult.
I have now recieved all the parts I need except a few little cosmetic things 

The reservoir will be the house of my 80A  sabvoton controller.

![IMG_20181205_161719|666x500](upload://qn6KmBa8fAivvo3bDX0yiMuzMNa.jpeg) 


And here is the drivetrain , 3000w 12kv motor ( according to my maths so it's worth what it's worth ) 
I should have according to my calculations the motor has a KV of 12 with a max RPM at 72 V of 864.
for 50 V I calculated an RPM of 605 

I don't know if I can base myself on this. Any help to have the realistic speed I'll get in the end , depending on the voltage. So I finally know if I will go 20S or 14S !
