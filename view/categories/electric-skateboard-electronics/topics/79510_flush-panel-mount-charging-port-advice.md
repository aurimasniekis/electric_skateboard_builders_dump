Whilst finalizing my wiring connection plans I've been thinking about this. I don't want to alter the battery end terminals if I don't have to. Most charge ports on lithium ion packs are a female  5.5mm bullet x 2.1mm (correct me if I'm wrong). My plan is to get an extra male barrel end, cut it, and wire it to a panel mount plug. For laziness sake, does anyone know of an existing adapter? The keywords "panel mount dc barrel plug adapter" bring up way too wide a variety of products on all main sites (including here) and I swear I read about someone referencing this. Thanks and happy new year!
