Depends. Where is your last stand point? Which time you stopped looking for vescs?

I‚Äòm into this only one year, but vesc6 derivates became pretty cheap. There are now dual vescs which share one pcb for two motors. Integrated anti spark switches and roll to start features. The new vesc firmware allows you to flash firmware from the master to the slave via CAN bus. Integrated Bluetooth modules. A lot of things happened in the last time.

I don't recommend units with 2 ESCs conjoined together, like this one above.  If you have a failure, you have to replace two ESCs instead of one, and less chance of the other side still working after a failure.

Flipsky sell dual vescs as well. 4.20hw and hw6. But There is no Bluetooth integrated and the anti spark switch is so so. Besides that they work well. Considering the point from @b264 it‚Äôs always up to what you want and need and if you ready to take the risk of breaking only one esc or both.

If you run both vescs on a separated power supply you can‚Äôt connect them via CAN bus. I wouldn‚Äôt do that if you want to use can.

The dual esc's recently on offer are convenient and are performing well. It could be argued that simplifying them, removing extra wiring, the tighter footprint and less plugged in components  will reduce failure rates in tight enclosures on hobby boards that are being worked on often.

Whether you buy one or not you're still going to have to listen to Brian regurgitate the same fucking "advice" over and over and over again. So you might as well buy one and reap the benefits.

I don't recommend CANBUS or any connection.  Even use 2 separate receivers for the remote.

I use canbus it works fine. I run one power supply for both vanda's I haven't had any problems with then. Over 50 miles I believe I have on them if not more. 10s4p

Don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs not working but you have different potentials on different vescs. Google about it and you will understand that it is not a good idea to do so üòâ

I wonder how you can skate without to making pipi in your pans every single time üòúüòÇ

Yes split ppm might have his advantages as well has CAN bus does. It‚Äôs always up to the person and which features are important for this person. I wouldn‚Äôt want to miss traction control on a mtb. With split ppm thats not possible. 

And what if I say you your receiver can break down as well üò± üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You're saying it's not a good idea to run one power supply for two vests. I have both of vesc connected as one. Master runs the left motor slave runs the right. I don't even get overheating problems

No I mean it‚Äôs not good to use one power supply for every vesc and than connect them via CAN bus. So two power supplies and CAN, bad idea. One power supply and parallel plug and CAN, good idea.

My bad I mixed that up in your comment. All good üòÖ

Push for this on there boards well 12s lipo on each motor

Some remotes, like this one

https://forum./t/how-to-bind-the-mini-remote/95

allow you to bind 2 receivers.  Just hook one receiver up to each ESC.  Easy-peasy

Add loads of excess electrical components to your build with a history of failure unnecessarily in order to make it more robust.

You can look up the wiring diagram here. Also trampa use only one power supply for both vescs. Both vescs are connected parallel to the battery.

Two power supplies, two VESCs and CAN works a treat on VESC 6. We do that all day long.

Nice to know!

So what i get wrong on your wiring diagram @trampa ? Looks like i‚Äòm totally stupid, but I don‚Äôt see that second battery for the second vesc and that i mean seriously. I don‚Äôt get it.

i fully agree. the only one i have seen that doesnt have severe issues with 2 vescs on 1 PCB is the flipsky 6.6 dual

the dual 6.6+ (antispark) appears to have issues with the switch breaking.

I am just waiting for flipsky to make a single 100a vesc....

In most cases people prefer one big battery, since charging is a lot more convenient. The VESC 6 is happy to run of its own battery while being CAN connected. No worries!
