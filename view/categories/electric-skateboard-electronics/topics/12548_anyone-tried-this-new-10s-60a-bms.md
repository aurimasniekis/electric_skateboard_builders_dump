Ok...so I was looking for a 10s 60a BMS with build in switch ..and I've stumbled upon this one, that says "Temperature Switch"
What is it ?? Would it allow me to have on/off switch without having anti spark protection ?

Looks good !
The max continuous discharge is great : 60A !!

Overheat protection.

i don´t like bms that go over 4,2V - this one starts overvoltage detection at 4,25V.

@appleton It looks promising to me. It the specs are as stated, it's a great form factor and price! I think the general concensus in the community is that 60A continuous is enough for most esk8 applications, and the burst rate seems good enough as well. Is the "temperature" switch a built-in on/off switch or a temperature sensor? 

The writing instructions are clear than other BMS's I've seen.

I think the version S is the right one as the charge and discharge is the same, so you don´t get problems with regenerative braking...
