Hey guys, I'm looking to build my own monster of a 4WD board. Im going to be buying 144 Samsung 40T cells for either two 12S6P set ups, or a single 12S12P battery. I want to build this as an AWD though, so I was wondering which path is easier. 2 separate batteries and 2 focboxes, or 2 batteries and 4 vesc's, or 1 battery and 2 foxboxes, or 1 battery and 4 vesc's?

Thanks for any advice!
