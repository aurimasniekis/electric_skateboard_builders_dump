Hi guys,

I want to build a battery Pack (12s 4p) for my esk8 and was wondering which cells to use. I was thinking about buying sony VTC6 cells from nkon but i read some bad things about them in older Threads (bad lifespan and that the 30 amp discharge rating is too optimistic). So i thought about just buying the 30Q cells since they seem to be what everyone is using. I am a bit worried about Voltage sack though since they only have a 15 amp discharge on paper and i am quite heavy (90kg-100kg)  Price isnt really a problem so if you have any other good cells maybe with other form factors I would be open for suggestions.

Well 20700 and 21700 cells are at a very competetive price atm.

Sony VTC series are also very good they offer more discharge rate, which is important in real world..

sony cells lose a lot of their capacity after 50 charges so i don't recommend them.
Fogstar wholesale sells Samsung 40T for only a tad more than 30q so i would personally use them but depends on your build. molicell p42a are like 40t but even better. probs best cell right now, but they cost a lot. about ~2Â£ more per cell :roll_eyes:
Sanyo  20700 and 21700 that @Chaki mentioned are good too especially with bigger packs. 

Do a bit of reading on the new forum

forum. esk8. news
