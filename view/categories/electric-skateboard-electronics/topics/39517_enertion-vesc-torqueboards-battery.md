I have a question on compatability/possibility

Enertions focbox used xt60 connectors and torqueboards 10s4p used xt90. Is it an issue if I unsolder the xt60 and solder on xt90 connectors on the focbox?

Thats a very good idea - because 90A are better than max 60A on the XT60.
Just take the right cable size.

You can also make an adaptor.
