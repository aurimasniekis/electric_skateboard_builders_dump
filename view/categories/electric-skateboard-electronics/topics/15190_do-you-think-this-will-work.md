should be fine. i had the same motor/wheels/gear ratio on 12s.

but you should use htd5.
but if you want htd3 use larger pulleys to get that ratio. like 16/40, more teeth.

Thanks for your tipps.
But I ordered them already so I will try if it work.
Otherwise I will do it like u said ;) thanks...

The problem was that they did not had the things with 5M I wanted or I was looking for.

I hope it will go but if the rest is ok, then I think I will get it working.


Regards!

they should work fine, in fact I read somewhere smaller pitch will have less rolling resistance.

and since its 15mm wide it should be ok, but if you get belt slip or wear you should move to htd5.
