Can someone tell me what hardware version I would have if I had purchased VESC from TB in early/mid 2016? I believe it was March-May time period. 

I'd like to use the new VESC tool to tweak some settings and want to make sure I can update my firmware and do that safely.

Thanks!

As far as I know, it's 4.12 but I'm sure Dexter knows better @torqueboards. :slight_smile:

That was my thought as well...I thought there was an easy check but I couldn't remember and didn't want to risk just plugging it in and trusting the tool then frying my VESC.

You can connect with @Ackmaniac's ESC tool and it will tell you the current firmware load. That should help you narrow it down.

Vesc Tool will recognize the HW version. It is a HW 4.12.
