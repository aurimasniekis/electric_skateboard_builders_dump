Can some experienced builders shed some light on mounting your electronics. 
I have a wood longboard with no cutout and plan to buy a enclosure from Psychotiller after I mock up the correct size.  May main questions - do I need foam padding between the wood and the components. Can I use double sided Velcro and straps for all the components? Should anything be fastened directly to the wood? Are there any components that absolutely should not touch each other? Thanks for your help.

use velcro to get all your components secure on your deck, then use padding between your components and the enclosure and youÂ´re good to go

What kind of padding do you recommend? would it be fine to velcro components on a w concave deck?

Soft craft foam attached to the walls of my enclosure works for me
