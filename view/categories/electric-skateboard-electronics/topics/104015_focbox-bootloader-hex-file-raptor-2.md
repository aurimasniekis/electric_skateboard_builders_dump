Hi everyone,

I'm looking for a bootloader file for my focbox of my Raptor 2. I was able to repair the failure I had which resulted in replacing the MCU. But now I need a bootloader so I can install the firmware. I've done quite a bit of searching and the only link to a file I could find is in this thread at the bottom. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/help-with-focbox-firmware-bootloader-upgrade-vesc-tool/34810/44

Unfortunately, the link leads me to a dead end and tells me the file is unable to be retrieved. Anyone one have said file or know where I can find one?

Thanks in advance!

Do you have a link to the one you are referring to? The links to Vedders download via the forums isn't working for me.(The one I posted in the first post)
