It's only 12A, so you'd have to bypass it.  Personally I am not a fan of bypassing your BMS because you lose so  many safety features

For 6S, just use a balance charger. It will work much better than that thing

I am definitely not using a balance charger. what features would I be bypassing with the cheap BMS? also what BMS would you recommend

They fail or don't work right from the start
IMO BMS should never be the cheapest part in your build

Bad components , bad assembly
Do you really feel comfortable protecting your vesc and battery for $15-$20 from a noname manufacturer.
Expensive ones fail too just usually not in way that'll ruin everything, switch might die, etc

12A can not use for electric skateboard. will burn when loaded too much, or during sort while. 

imaging when you driving fast, then suddenly lose power, and can not brake......

> Over charge detection voltage:	**4.325**Â±0.025V

Not to mention, that thing has a over-charge detection voltage that is way too high. It potentially could charge a cell all the way up to 4.35V before cutting off

That cheap BMS could destroy your batteries. Get one from SuPower or Bestech that is rated for the current you will actually pull.  Or use the hobby charger. It will work much better

So the thing is: 
You cannot use this for discharge.  It WILL cut out power in the worst moment
You can use it for charge if you are willing to risk the low quality and can't afford better
You will get what you pay for

Bottom line.  I use a cheap bms only for charging my 10s. But i can't use a hobby charger

Yes I'm sorry for all the questions I have done a lot of research and watched a lot of youtube videos and a lot of people use the cheap eBay BMS's for charging their 6s lipos so I was confused why it is bad

If i were to buy it i would probably check whenever it does the balancing action nicely.. i think this might be biggest pitfall with these sort of bms that they balance slowly or only at very end of charging, so u got to check / know when really balancing action has been completed (especially / more important for lipo probably)..

and not just rely on light telling u that charging has been ended when in fact it might be that volts have been reached but cells are not balanced yet (ive heard.some people leaving chargers on for the night also but everyone should.decide for themselves if they wish to do so)

Other.than that i would like to believe it should work for charging purpose but i would probably still check first times that it does its job nicely.

I suspect 88ma balance current isnt the worst or slowest. I think ive seem something around 40 ma for other bms while hobby chargers tend to do 100-200 ma i think. 

So if the specs are true it might not be the slowest bms balance module

I think people usually order.from bmssupport / s page. What i would watch out would be the bms bulkyness. Though i think.this only happens for these beefy high discharge.bms.

Why people tend to recommend to go with good.quality bms is probably because they tend to fail or.not work probably quite often. Though i think this.might be specially true when they are used for discharge purpose too, so.u might be somewhat covered that u would use it.just.for.charging (hence one plug, no need to carry around smart charger and set it up each time.)

Otherwise.. wish u find info from someone has tried it, havent used it, so cant tell whenever it works good

## \#33 Posted by: Okami Posted at: 2017-09-29T20:25:50.760Z Reads: 96

Yeh, he is also on forum. So if u order try to make sure your power supply outputs 25.2v or so.. otherwise bms can mess up your cells a bit by overcharging them to 4.3v or something.. 4.3v is not immediately critical but probably not something good for their health / cycle life.

Of course it doesnt mean that 27v will overcharge but use 25.2 just to be safe like he said in video.

@VladPomogaev maybe can shed some more light how these bms perform?

---
## \#35 Posted by: jmasta Posted at: 2017-09-29T20:28:39.999Z Reads: 96

```
I don't agree with Vlad on that.  An over-charge detection voltage of 4.325V +/- 0.025 (4.35V max) is way too high.  If you are using the BMS for charging only, it's only purpose is to balance the cells and keep them from over-charging.  That cheap BMS could technically charge them to 4.35V before it even notices.  Any BMS with an over-voltage protection of greater than 4.25V should be avoided
```

---
## \#36 Posted by: krloz Posted at: 2017-09-29T20:32:36.777Z Reads: 94

```
Yeah but it would only overcharge your cells if your power supply is outputting more than 4.2xcells. However it is true the bm.s. will not protect in case the supply somehow fails and rises in voltage
```

I agree, that is why i recommend for him to check everything if he does make the step to go in this direction. Honestly i usually check everytime that cells are all good, even if i dont use bms (where everything is hidden and checking cells might be a lot harder...

I would sort of advice to install seperate cell checker, to monitor voltages seperetaly outside of bms to see whenever everything gets balanced nicely.. this.might require parallel balance wires though

Last thing if you are trying to save money you can get a IMAX B6 on eBay for about 15-20 bucks then you can just plug it in and it will charge very easy and much better than the bms. And to power it you can use a old laptop charger or something you already have
```

Yeh, if u go really extreme, i suppose one can "install" b6 permanently in deck. Though ive heard it might not be best if electronics are.not 100% protected against shock there.and something comes loose.. next part.would be to load some auto settings, so u can start charging just with a few clicks after plugging in the power cord.. would see all the voltages and stuff, mah pumped in.. and wouldnt need to.be in blind spot about what is happening with cells on cell.level

Yeah man I'm thinking of opening my B6 and putting some relays in there to act as if the switches were being pressed then have them connect to an arduino or picaxe that presses them in a certain order to start charging

Would love to see the implementation of this. I suppose if case is removed at least partly, some space could be gained. Though u would probably still need the "rail" for cooling fets of charger

Yes the rail would probably have to stay but I would only need to cut away a smal portion to gain access to the buttons. Do you know if the charger will deplete my batteries if I leave them plugged in for long periods? That is my only concern

I think it only works as output to battery side (does not drain batteries unpowered), though it would probably be best to check this or just install small switch to be totally safe

I use a 10$ 12A ebay bms.
Using it for 5 months right now, all cells are still balanced, I use a 4A 25,2V charger and a 6S2P 10Ah Lipo  battery pack.
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/252611077311
I only use the bms for charging and it's just working fine for me.
It's so much easier than a balance charger.
