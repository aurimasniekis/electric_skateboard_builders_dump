All is in the title. I have received the charger but realized there's no power source included. 
I can use a laptop type of charger but then I need an interface between the jack and the XT60. I could only find adapter between male jack and XT60.

Exactly! Thanks. I will see if I can find them in the UK to get them quicker.
That should close the topic.
