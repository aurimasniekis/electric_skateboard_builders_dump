Hey there, i took me a bit to figure out how to post my question here, so if i messed up in any way please understand i'm a total newbie. I bought a halo 2 in june, rode it for a month, hit a water patch and it took a bath in the river, sent it in to get motors/battery/esc swapped. I took some time before i got it fixed to look over all of the components to get a general understanding, and i noticed my esc takes up quite a bit of room, so i can easily swap it out for a vesc and have more control of the tuning and whatnot. I noticed there are different connections and different types for specific batteries, i was wondering if anyone has any experience or a reasonable understanding of what the best next step for choosing a new vesc to fit my current stock electronics. The battery is 10s3p i think, and the motors are advertised as 1500w each. Ty in advance fellas.

Thinking that the halo is a rebranded Chinese product and while this is not necessarily a bad thing it does make upgrading a little more tricky than just swapping out the esc.  I would assume the electronics are Chinese bespoke parts which can be easily proved by checking that the esc is a single part running two motors ie a dual esc.  It will probably have a built in switch and receiver so in addition to changing it you will need to buy either two vescs or a dual like the enertion unity or Flipsky.  Also if you go the two VESC route you will need to get an anti spark switch like a Vedder or torque boards unit.  In any case you will need a new remote/receiver system too.   If itâ€™s space you are after and not performance then by the time you factor all those extra bits you probably wonâ€™t save much room. Also be careful of the battery bms on those units as they have a low amp rating so when programming you will need to take that into consideration or risk popping said bms.  I did this very upgrade to a meepo and ran into all these issues but the board now is a very different animal indeed.  
If I have the halo all wrong and it has a different set up then this is 2 minutes of your time youâ€™ll never get back.  ðŸ˜‚

Easily checked though by looking at the guts.  I tried on line but didnâ€™t get much info.

That was pretty helpful in just narrowing down my options, i saw in a less similar topic that a vesc would help with reducing draw from the battery and tuning speed or torque. I also heard programming is a pain if i dont know anything about the process or values of the parts. But i'm a fast learner ðŸ˜‰

I'm also curious how your meepo turned out when you made the upgrade.
