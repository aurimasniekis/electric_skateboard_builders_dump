will it adjust the trim on my board if it was turned by accident or is it only for rc cars and stuff?

Yes it will adjust the trim. But it's not important

So if I mistakenly moved it and canâ€™t get it back will it affect the acceleration and speed of my board?

No. It adjusts the nuetral zone. Well at least that's what mine does

Nope. You will just find the board will keep slowly creeping along even when the throttle is at neutral. Then jut turn the knob until it stops

You need those, put them back on.
One is for the wheel and one is for the trigger.

Well I was calling attention to the questions he's been asking that can be answered by reading, but I did add the emoji to show that it wasnt to seem like I was being a dick, however I dont recall saying I'd lock his account?

Well I was speaking to preventing him from asking questions that could be easily answered and my intent was for it to sound like a joke. But apologies either way since that's not what I meant

Ahh I didn't actually know that. I haven't ridden with different trim setting I have just played with them on the bench and all I noticed is that it seem like the neutral range on my remote had changed

All good, the alteration is minor but overall gives you more or less control
