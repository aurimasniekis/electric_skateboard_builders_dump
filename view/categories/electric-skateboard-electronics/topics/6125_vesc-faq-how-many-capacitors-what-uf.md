Why they use only two caps then? Cause it's cheaper!
[/quote]

Cheaper & quicker to assemble and most importantly more compact. The various cap configurations that we are delivering are due to what was available from suppliers at the time. When we bought parts for the first 1000 we couldn't secure 3000 caps of the same type. So we had to make some changes otherwise there would be more delays...

Its also worth pointing out that VESC 6.0 is adopting the same configuration of 2 caps.... in my opinion two caps is the best configuration in terms of size, price and assembly time.

```

on vedder's site testing has been done by Ren and really there should be more caps than on there.  Without enough caps the inductance of the wires will slowly or quickly destroy the vesc.

The FOC program especially suffers from the inductance of the battery wires

The new upgraded vesc has two caps..

The beauty of DIY is you can add more if you need them. Put on 10 and see if you get better results.

..but on the 6.0VESC they are much closer to the power stage..

@onloop just send them, as i said no problem with waiting. But if they come different as shown in the picture you lost 1 customer for the future. Already last time when i bought vesc from you, on your page they were shown with wires+cap soldered but they came without.:sleeping:
When i buy things from other sellers, things arrive like they are shown, or at least there is a decent hint which says something different.

They "close the gap" for the battery to provide the VESC additional power on demand. Your battery cables may not seem long, but they are for the VESC.

## \#19 Posted by: Aleendis Posted at: 2016-07-14T15:45:03.799Z Reads: 389

Simply spoken: It's the internal resistance in the capacitor. If you put resistors (with the same value) in parallel the resistance decrease.
If capacitors put in parallel the capacity adds up. 

So it's better to use more caps if a low esr counts.

Hi, I did my electrical engineering course some decades ago, so I'm a little rusty regarding some concepts.

I would understand the importance of the ESR if the capacitors were between the ESC and the motor since the current has several different frequencies.

But since the capacitors are between the battery and the ESC their main purpose is to accumulate energy and compensate the lenght of the cables, it shouldn't make any differente the ESR value.

Anybody can prove me wrong about my understanding. I have been proven wrong before and learned something new. :slight_smile:

Currently finishing up my EE degree and you're pretty much correct. The capacitors are there to prevent voltage droop of the battery when the current being drawn from the battery spikes. Also @Aleendis what you are talking about is actually called impedence and it works pretty much in the same way as resistance, but in reference to energy storage devices and motors (capacitors, inductors, batteries, etc.)

So you say, you testet the 50V caps under very hard circumstances on a 12S setup? Cause i heard caps are very sensitive to overvoltage. Another thing i only read, I believe then. No need to blow up things just because i want to test it. Also i don't have the money for that kind of fun.
But keep going on if that is your way of making buisness :sleepy:

[/quote]

No mistake, it is a decision made by the engineers at the factory making the VESC, we needed to secure stock quickly to ensure production delays didnt continue to interrupt the schedule. In the end we sourced enough qty using a combination of Single 50v 3300uf & Dual 63v 1000 uf.

What voltage battery will you be running?

We have also designed a new CAP PCB for VESC, this concept is to simplify the setup of dual vesc, it has 4 holes for output wires making it much easier to run twin vesc from single cap board.

normally i wont complain it that much... but this time i am a bit mad...

One delay hunts the next delay ... ok, the VESC is fairly new and so on but @onloop could have told the costumer that they change something in the product! He did not.

Now i have payed for a product which i dont get as described. That is what i dont like. Now you tell me that i should take responsibility for others faults?

To put it in a netsheel: I am not totally freaking out. i am just a bit mad about the behavior!

Got my VESCs yesterday and they've got 63v caps! First thing I checked out of curiosity after reading this, Jason apparently worked it out with the manufacturer very quickly! Or they have run out of 50v caps and now only have 63, so I think everyone should be alright.

So would it be possible to get confirmation, hopefully from @onloop. If I have 63v capacitors on Enertion VESCs (which I do), am I safe to run 12S? 

Would be a nice bonus if true, as the specs on the Enertion site state 10S max, so I was aiming for 8S, but the motors can handle it, so if I can stick another 4S LiPo on there that would be great.

incorrect... the impedance of a cap or inductor refers to resistance but also reactance "X" - the time-varying phase shift of the current or voltage it's resisting... that doesn't get "spent" in the form of heat.

The ESR or _Resistance_ is the actual resistive component of the inductance (think total Z = 1/jwC + ESR) or X + ESR

The ESR being high means, when you try to pull a lot of current, V=IR will be your voltage drop from the cap internals out the wire, to your VESC.  So if there was 0.1 ohm ESR and you tried to pull 10A out of a 40V cap, you would only "see" about 40V - 0.1(10) = 39V.  Imagine an instantaneous inrush of 100A and you lose 10V!

If you start combining a bunch of caps into one package or picking cheaper, larger values you typically have an increase in ESR which not only heats up your cap (shortening the life) but is less "real" - the capacitance isn't really at the voltage you want after it is burnt across the ESR.  The cap heating effect is why your capacitor has a **"ripple current" rating** meaning how much watts it can passively dissipate as it is constantly burning back and forth as current moves across it.  I doubt builders like Jason are measuring these values in their design.  Note that for every 10 deg C you increase the temp of aluminum electrolytic caps the lifetime is cut in HALF!

Definitely study up on reactance vs impedance vs resistance as you finish your EE degree as people love to ask this sort of shit in technical interviews ;-)

Does that mean that multiple capacitor might be less preferred than a single, big capacitor because its will combine the ESR, increase the resistance between positive and negative and means an increase in voltage drop?

Sorry if its a stupid quesion.

Multiple capacitor do "combine the ESR" as you say, but they combine in parallel meaning overall resistance goes down.

Imagine 1 guy with a pile of 100 snowballs VS 10 guys with a pile of 10 snowballs each.  Which would you rather get in a snowball fight with ;-)

My bad, I'm not sure why I typed "increased" :) what I have in mind is reduced

So does that mean that bigger capacitor is better since its just a single capacitor or the ESR is relative to farad?

Sorry I have no idea about this. I only know the basics of resistors. Parallel is subtraction and series is addition :)

## \#52 Posted by: FredSaberhagen Posted at: 2017-04-29T01:57:49.684Z Reads: 121

```
Series may be addition but parallel is hell no subtraction (If I start with 1 ohm and put two more 1 ohm in parallel do I get negative resistance?  ;-) )

Bigger cap is better from an energy standpoint -  And you can always pay more money to get lower ESR for any given size cap - but if you could choose 1x660uF or 2x330uF , the 2x will probably deliver it more effectively (inductance is also a factor with long package leads and high di/dt).  The only reason to go single big package is cost.

Hello guys,

I've read many posts about caps as my vescs are the ones with a big cap instead of 3 smaller ones.

At the moment I would like to change my caps but I am wondering what is the typical Vue for a low esr for the vesc.

0.1ohm is what we should aim for? Lower? I'm trying to figure out what values I should be looking for.
