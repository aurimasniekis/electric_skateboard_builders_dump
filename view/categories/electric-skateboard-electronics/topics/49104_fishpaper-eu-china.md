If you want it fast, nkon.nl
If you want it slow, I just bought a bunch on aliexpress. Can gladly share once it arrives.

I have never seen any fishpaper in stock at NKON, just the gasket stickers. damn shame as it would be so easy to order with the cells

I got mine from an ebay seller called bon-estore. The seller doesn't have a listing for these right now, but the listing was identical to this one, so maybe it's the same product?

Quality was really great. Thick, waxy paper and strong adhesive.
