I want to order a personalized BMS from Bestech. The question is about the individual possible options i can choose from.

Are there any recommendations for these details:

Single overcharge protection voltage
Single overcharge recovery voltage
Balance voltage
Balance current

i am using a 12S4P 30Q Pack with a 50.4V 5A charger.

The readings are not static, they go up and down based on current usage.  The readings are averaged over a specific period of time by the BMS, I don't know what that period is.  The over voltage detection is a little high for that reason.  If you make it any lower, and I don't think BesTech will, you run the risk of not being able to fully charge, that is better handled with an adjustable charger.
