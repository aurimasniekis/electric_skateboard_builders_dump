Can I charge batteries on pararell board like that one? ![2016022722350391-1031262|690x388](upload://tIrtExL68GZxq7I6nihtmGeBDkl.jpeg)

Why dont you charge it in series? and use your board in series? 

Just check at this esk8 calculator, so you can see the benefits of using you board in both ways...

Also check  forum....most builders are there

NO, don’t put those balance wires in parallel the way this is wired. Your wiring would only work to use two separate balance chargers for each pack. If you charge as described with your diagram, it’ll short the cells and burn your balance wires. If you want to charge the batteries together using the balance board you showed then make sure to put the anti spark loop key between the cells, and make sure to ONLY charge without the loop key installed. (Have seen others do this where they put the loop key in a spot that when it’s plugged in it doesn’t allow the charger to be inserted to prevent mistakes). 

Also be sure to join the esk8 . news forum, it’s a new forum by the people for the people; it’s way more active.

Take your time to read and learn, electrical stuff it is no joke... You could ask at the  forum, most builders are over there.

Why such a hassle and no internal BMS?
