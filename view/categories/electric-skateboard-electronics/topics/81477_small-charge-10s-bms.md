Hey, everyone, I'm looking for a small and reliable charge BMS, it seems nobody ever posts what BMS they use

Oh and in small I mean smaller than the Bestech d140, and _before you tell me to use the search function I did!_

gonna buy one and see how long it lasts

There's a perfect gap on the Spud for a small bms ![IMG_20190119_231618|666x500](upload://tvtxEFlKd5ZZxcdMz4kmhqPZFJd.jpeg)

dont trust that. find the model number and check the data sheets. it seems if you want to go down to that from factor and still keep balance capability you will have to solder balance boards.

Thats why im not gonna install the bms in the batt pack but out in the open so i can alawys monitor indivudal cell voltages, plus it uses 11 pin leads so it should fit most other bms, and the 75a discharge the bms clams is totally a sham

@ZachTetra trust me, i always make it fit :sunglasses:

Did it say balance cells and overcharge protection,  if not it's not what you need. A lot of these small BMS is for a different use were the steady drain of the cells. Not what we do. Being erratic in the draining of the pack brings the necessity of individual balancing

Yes, they can. It does cause the cells themselves to heat up during charging.
I would recommend 4a max on the Samsung 30q. the size of the cell (small) can degrade faster with more heat and stress.
The 21700 Samsung 50E  is a cell I would recommend a higher charge amp because it can take it. larger capacity, less charging = longer life

## \#35 Posted by: hyperIon1 Posted at: 2019-01-21T02:22:17.402Z Reads: 74

I'm not debating what the cells can take. It's just my experience that packs charged at half the recommended or rated charging amps makes for a healthier pack when charging, less balancing. 
We all want to charge our boards in 10 minutes, one day soon I think it will be so.
It also less chance of failure during charging. Some people still leave packs plugged in overnight and for days at a time.
Safety

charging amps, they didn't offer a 12s D127 until we asked them to, they only had it in 10s. 
the D124 is what it is because of its size. 
I will ask tonight when I speak with the rep, It doesn't indicate as (adjustable) on the site but that doesn't mean much.

Oh so your gonna ask them to raise the charge amps?, if the d124 was smaller and was charge only, higher than 4a it would be the best bms for esk8 at 10s

well, what I'm thinking, Its designed to have X amps in and X amps out, right?
if the amps OUT are higher than the amps IN, the out circuits can be used for IN charging amps especially in a charge/discharge same port bms

To simplify, I think it can be done using components already present on the bms that are not being used for discharge (because its direct from the battery)
it sounds like a brain twister but its just using what's there to increase the amps in.
I'm not trying to over brain you like some on the forum, You brought up a great point. Something to look into, thank you.

I just received a HCX-D124 BMS from Litechpower and of course it's missing some component, a mosfet I guess?

Could I fix this? Does anyone know what is the exact component which should be soldered there? I just wouldn't want to wait for a replacement BMS to arrive from China.. If they even want to replace it.

![bms|666x500](upload://z6BXvc7F2HFRDfTgZUZ3yrADFQ2.jpeg) 

While talking about the subject, when using this BMS as charge only do I still connect the charger port to C- and just leave the P- untouched?

![image|641x387](upload://lNWUR11d2NmbTqGO6SAVM9Bepk.jpeg)

Hello everyone, 
What is exactly the difference between the D124 BMS and the D239?
I ordered the D239 (http://litechpower.com/product-detail/HCX-D239LI10S08A-07.html) for my 10S4P pack (8A max. charging current instead of 4A).
But I am a little confused where to connect the negative charging Port, there is no C-. 

![image|690x494](upload://fjiagpt8BBKPMdfpt5nyoogTrk3.jpeg) 

![image|690x458](upload://TZbXsS0iEu6qmSqBauNh18kw6t.jpeg) 

to P- or to the back (upper-left corner) ?

Thanks for your help.

## \#53 Posted by: AlanZhou Posted at: 2019-03-15T21:15:17.642Z Reads: 52

The discharge and stuff are different.

The d124 is 4a charge and 10a discharge
The d239 is 8a charge and 8a discharge

![D124|654x500](upload://eMFSVijHOnKVyVYpY02gKcASX2W.png) ![D239|641x500](upload://bgdB3rZoUNZRtNX7YUmzlILvLiQ.png)

I would recommend getting the d239 because 10a discharge is too little anyways so the extra 4a in charge rate of the d239 would benefit a lot.

D124 is for li-ion only and D239 is for lipo or li-ion.  The "overdischarge detection voltage" is the key difference.

[quote="tobias, post:52, topic:81477"]

Connect [a fuse](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/576-099707.5WXN) to P- and connect the other side of the fuse to the charge port negative.

Overall D239 is better

Hallo

I have just wired the bestech hcx-D239 BMS Up. 
Just did a charge.... When the cell voltage reach about 4,12v the charter starts to cycles between charching and not charching constantly. Is this normal ?
On my charching port, the plus comes directly from the main plus on battery, and the minus is connectet to P-  on the BMS. The B- on the BMS, is connectet directly to the main negative on the battery.

This happened to me also when using a Bestech BMS. It turns out one of the cells was going above the overcharge protection threshold (4.25v I think), so the BMS cut the power. Can you check the individual cell voltages of your pack and see if any are >4.2v when this happens?
