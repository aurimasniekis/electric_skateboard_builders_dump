Hello guys!
I'm using a chinese dual esc and it worked perfectly fine until one day I went 7 km under heavy rain. The board held up but after some hours the esc was not working correctly, I couldn't shut the board down and sometimes the motors didn't spin. 
So I opened up the board, dryed everything and good as new( or at least i thought). It kept working for another 2 weeks until one day, one of the motors stoped spinning. I checked it out and the problem comes from the esc. 
Did I fry it?

If your board isn’t sealed properly you will run into the same issue using VESCs. You know water can damage electronics if they aren’t protected.
