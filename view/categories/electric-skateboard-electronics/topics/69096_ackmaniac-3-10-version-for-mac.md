Hey guys, 

After a lot of research I realized ackmaniac 3_10 was the way to go to configure my eskating dual beast. Me being smart and lucky enough I've always been using windows. But a lot of my friends within the eskate community for some reason are still using mac without a windows boot drive. Asked @rpasichnyk kindly and here we have it. Thanks @kaly for recommending me the 3_10 software, works like a charm.

Enjoy 
Leonard
