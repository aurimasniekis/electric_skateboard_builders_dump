If you are planning to run it with a 6s 10Ah battery then it seems good.

The batteries.
From a couple of 6s 5ah batteries you can make 12s 5ah(series) or 6s 10ah(parallel).
To build 10s 10ah you need four 5s 5ah batteries or a couple of 5s 10ah.

You can't make a 10s pack from 6s

Yup, seems fine.
