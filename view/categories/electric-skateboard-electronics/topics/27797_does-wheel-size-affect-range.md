Would you get more range from 83mm vs 97mm??

It will increase your start up torque but decrease the distance you roll per revolution. It will also decrease your top speed, but slightly increase how fast you accelerate to top speed.

So all in all I’d get more range with 97’s? I was just wondering because my Bamboo GT is just a mile shy or so of the range I want

More than likely you'd get closer to your goal with the 97's. There are so many variables. Amps generated by increased torque demands on take off or climbing...That will use a little more juice, No matter what. You add/you have to take away.
I think more than likely though you could squeeze a couple more miles out of your board with slightly larger wheels.
