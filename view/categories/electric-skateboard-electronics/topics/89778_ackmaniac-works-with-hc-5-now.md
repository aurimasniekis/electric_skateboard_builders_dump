```
during a build noticed I was out of hm-10 modules.   
Just like watching a movie for the second time, hoping for it to change at a climax. 
    In a bind needing to deliver I tried an hc-5 and it worked.   Thanks @Ackmaniac for new firmware?
Must also be im using vesc6.   Only bad thing is every module come up as the same ID.  So if im using multiple boards it shows just one bluetooth hc5.
