Recently got myself a Meepo board as my first eskate, and already in the process of making it more to my taste.
I've swapped out the deck, and built space for a second battery which is on the way. To power the Board, I'll be hooking those 10s2p LG packs in parallel using an XT60 Y-harness.
How would I go about charging them together? Would a JST parallel Y-harness do the trick, or is there something I'm missing?

if they have an integrated BMS then yes just the same way you discharge them. If they dont have a bms you will need a parallel balance connector too.

Awesome, they both have integrated BMS so that'll be ideal, Thanks! Now to work out how to strip them and make them slimmer, lol

did you do this? I was wondering how easy it would be to strip them and lay them in 1 layer instead of 2.

Sadly I never did get around to breaking it down and laying it flat, though I did crack one open and have a good nosey. Heard a rumour that Kevin Dark was going to do the same thing, so waiting to see if he releases a video of his process :)
