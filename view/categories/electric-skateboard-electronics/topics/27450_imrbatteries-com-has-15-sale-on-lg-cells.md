Hey guys just though you you guys should know that 30Q cells are actually better than hg2s. I have seen conflicting answers but this pretty much confirms it.

I actually kind of annoyed cause I ordered some lg hg2s for a new pack yesterday from imrbatteries.

yea the point wasn't which cells are better, just pointing out the good deal is all.

it's over today though so get in while u can.

tempted to horde them but...don't have space or the motivation.

I did a side-by-side comparison of the LG HG2 and the 30Q using the West Mountain Radio CBT. At 7A discharge, the 30Q came out very slightly ahead: 
HG2: 2680mAh
30Q: 2754mAh

The results were similar at higher discharge (I don't have those figures available). With only like a 3% difference, I'd call the two roughly equivalent.

But if you have more batteries, the 30Q will win?

Like you have 48 LG HG2 and drive the 48 SAMSUNG 30Q will drive you a few kilometers longer?

```
Let's do the math. At 3P with my batteries, you'll get: 
* 3x2680mAh = 8040mAh on the HG2
* 3x2754mAh = 8262mAh on the 30Q
= 222mAh extra distance on the 30Q. Not too significant. Certainly not a kilometer. 

At 300P with my batteries,  you'll get:
* 300x2680mAh = 804000mAh on the HG2
* 300x2754mAh = 826200mAh on the 30Q
= 22200mAh extra distance on the 30Q. Quite significant. Many kilometers. 

In either case, you still get a 3% relative performance improvement on the 30Q. As you add more batteries in parallel, that relative difference has a greater impact on distance.

Not so much that I thought :3

The LG has 20A discharge and 30Q Has 15A,
People say the more discharge you have the less voltage sag you have.

You should add two more batteries btw. It saves you two bucks and you get two spares for free ^^

That's the specification. I test both at 20A discharge and they were comparable (and had roughly the same temperature). Effectively, I'm quite comfortable taking both to 20A. Samsung is just being more conservative in what they report.

yea the 30q's continous discharge is under reported, it can handle 20a easily, apparently.

"Have been worst" with no data doesn't really help anyone.

If i saved 17% in the cost of the batteries for a reduction of 5% of power/capacity, then i think i still come out ahead.

@thisguyhere yup apparently lg was more aggressive with how they rated their cell

@chsknight 
This website has a bunch of real world test between tons of cells including 30q and lg cells.

For what it's worth, my measurement above was for the P222 HG2 batteries dated August 2016. Not sure if it was post manufacturing retooling, though.
