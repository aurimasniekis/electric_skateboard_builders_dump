Using them at the moment with 8S Lipo, they perform good so far.
Comparable to the SK3-6374-192kv imo.

From left to right:
SK3 - APS - RSPEC - DYMOND

Regardless the kv:

SK3 6374 = 63mm Diameter and 74mm Bodylength
SK3 6355 = 63mm Diameter and 55mm Bodylength

There are also 5050 motors... So i dont get what you mean by your sentence. Could you enlighten me?

sk3 is not 63mm diameter it is actually 59mm, but anyways it's tagged as 6374. got it?
the alien is 63mm like it's called. and this dymond looks even bigger on the pic, i want someone to confirm or deny this.

been looking at the diamond while looking for parts for my first build, couldn't resist now after you've been pushing these pictures under my nose again, it's on it's way now :) 

question now is, upgrade or just start all over with a new build ;)
