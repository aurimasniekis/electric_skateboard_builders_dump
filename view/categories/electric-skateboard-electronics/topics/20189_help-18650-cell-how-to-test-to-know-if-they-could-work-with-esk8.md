I've just pulled my portable charger apart and found out the have 18650 cells in them. It was 4 for $25 Aud and I don't know how to test them to see if they could work for a custom pack if I got more. It was a 5000mAh pack so I'm guessing they are 2500mAh each cell could they work, I want to make sure before I get more of them. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/3/a34956ba80908d30e2df0d5ff1e654a70cb06e09.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/9/9924b5f3b44cf776229438379bc342633c8cb97e.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/5/05f4ae5a8753a4ee3b5c133d5e6358d7b46389bb.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I guess they are [these](https://energyhk.en.alibaba.com/product/1836988997-800135215/Authentic_high_drain_18650_battery_SZNS_rechargeable_2500mah_battery_cell_for_e_cig.html). With a max discharge current of 2A they are definitly not suitable for an esk8. You would need at least like 10 of them in parallel to have a minium acceptable power for an esk8.

I hope those cells have a higher discharge rate than the mobile charger ones. What battery pack configuration are you aiming for?

The color of Cell tell you what discharge they  have.

The color of the heatshrink doesn't tell you anything about discharge rate...

why is there more than 1 red lines then? :D

It is just a ''wrap'' / decoration / protection cover for the metal cell..

U need to look up the model / name of the cell, to determine its capacity / discharge rate.

You just don't. Look up what is written on the cell and you get your data.

 Nah dude, if it's got red heatshrink it's good to like 100A. That's a fact. 

Or something

Battery bro sales those cells with iron man heat shrink. I'm 100% sure those do 1.21 Jigawatts!
