I've been in limbo for the past month because I'm afraid my setup wont work properly. So here it is!

Batteries:
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-2s-7-4v-60c-hardcase-pack.html x6 (4 in Series 2 in parallel. 8s2p)

Charging:
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-accucel-8-150w-7a-balancer-charger.html
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-reaktor-pro-350w-23a-power-supply-100-240v-ac.html

BMS:
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/8s-li-ion-pcm-charge-5a-discharge-15a.html

Motor:
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

Would this be ok? 

(yet to purchase a vesc)

You know right your max ampere usage must be below 15A or the BMS will get cooked. And that means your batteries are kinda overkill/useless because they have such high discharge rate.

Everything is perfect expect for the BMS, the bms only tolerate up to 15A, and your motor 80A. So you will not get the max power with that bms because the max is 15a and it will fry. If you bypass it like @makevoid said, only use it for charging. Then everything should work just fine :)

You don't really need a BMS. Only if you want to charge your board like a laptop(one wire).

I suggest to search for somebody who knows electric circuits before/while connecting everything together to prevent you creating a short circuit. With any battery but with lipos more than others you risk to make the battery damage itself because of a short circuit.The multimeter lets you test that the current is flowing in the direction you want (checking voltage), and if you turn the knob to the Î© part of the "pie" you will be able to check resistance (for example if a end of a wire is connected to the right end, to see if a material is conductive etc). So either learn some basic things about circuits or get a help from somebody that knows and if you can get a multimeter, get it. ^^

Excellent battery choice!
And don't let anyone tell you these batteries are overkill. They are not. 
Even with these batteries, there will be a little voltage sag. 
But much less sag than lower power batteries.

Actually I was not referring to anything you said. Or anything that had been previously posted on this thread.
In Fact, I agree with everything you've said in this thread.
I just thought I would throw that in just in case someone later came around saying that the batteries where a bad choice because they're  overkill.
Because I have found through testing that having a battery pack capable of 10X the current needed is a really good thing. Voltage sag is greatly reduced which equals better performance and better range. However, there are some who believe that a 60a battery pack is plenty for an E-skate and sure it can be in certain situations. I once had such a 10s battery on my build and it worked fine on flat ground but as soon as I started tackling hills, my range was cut more than in half because of excessive voltage sag.

You'll need 8 of those. Two 8S packs wired in parallel would give you 8S2P.

the packs are 2s each, so just 4 of them to form 8s and another 2 in parallel to from 2p no?

You'd need to make 2 separate 8S packs and then wire those two packs in parallel.

@NickTheDude Is absolutely correct and for the life of me I don't know why none of the rest of us caught that! 
In order to to have 8s 2p you need 16 cells or eight 2s packs. 
You might consider a 10s 1p using 5 packs which is smaller and lighter and a better match for a 192kv motor. You will have a little more top speed and still get 10+ miles of range. Use a good 10s BMS and a brick charger. (This is the setup I use)
Or 8s 1p with your balance charger if you don't mind a little less top speed and range. 
I'm guessing around 20+ mph and 8+ mile range.

It is my opinion that a battery pack with 60a capability is fine for flat land riding but if you have lots of hills to ride then you need more power which means higher current capability.
This is my situation and why I built a 300a battery pack. 
Because when I tried to use a 60a pack, I suffered extreme voltage sag which greatly reduced range. 
But not on flat ground, riding at moderate speed.

Yeah I was reading through this and I'm like "uuuhhh guys he's got 12 cells somehow arranged 8s2p" haha whew glad you guys saw it. The 2P doesn't refer to having 2 extra batteries in parallel. It refers to having a second 8s battery in parallel ( so think 8s x 2). If you only put the 2 batteries in parallel you'd be trying to feed you VESC with one 8s pack and one 4s pack. idk exactly what will happen there but it will never be good for the poor 4s pack trying to support such a high load. Just grab 2 more packs and you'll have a wicked powerful 8s2p that can push like 250a if you need it to.

The purpose of a balance charger is to charge each cell equally to balance voltage. The point of a BMS is to disperse the incoming power equally among the cells. However, the BMS can also limit discharge, but the VESC shouldn't cause a problem for discharge if set up right.

The good thing about a BMS though is you can solder it inside the board and just charge the board with a laptop charge with the right amps and volts. Bad thing about BMS is you can't really check on it easily to see if it is still working well and doing its job.

Good thing about balance charge is it is very reliable to get you a good charge. Some also have different settings for different types of charges, such as to put it in storage it can somewhat drain the battery. The bad thing about the balance charger is the user interface and process. You have to set your battery preferences, plug the positive, negative, and balance lead in, and select your charge every time. So if you plan on loaning it to a friend, you will have to give them a tutorial on that.

Probably a 6s is the absolute lowest voltage you want, but most people do 8s or above. With 6s don't expect much power wise.

Most car batteries have high amps, low volts I believe. Plus the chemistry of the battery is off so there won't be as much support on the forum for that. A lot of people build there own custom battery, and if you have the materials (spot welder, nickel strips, cells) then that is a great solution.
