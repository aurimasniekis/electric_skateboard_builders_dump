Anyone care to venture a guess as to the function of the two pots pictured here?

```
Ones for voltage and the others for amperage adjustment

Indeed, looks like top one is current, bottom one is voltage.

Did you try to adjust current with one of these?
I just got one, neither seemed to adjust current.

I had a hard time measuring the changes on mine as well.  I don't know if it makes sense that you need to restart the charger, or just replug it back in to the board, or I'm just not sure.  I do know that in my use case, using a DieBieMS, I could not get the battery to fully charge until I cranked the voltage way up.  Then the BMS was able to not only fully charge the battery, but much more consistently.  I cranked the amperage to max as well, but just assumed it was providing more current.
