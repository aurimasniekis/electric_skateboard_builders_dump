I'm building my very first electric longboard. It is going to be somewhat ridiculous and overpowered, and for that I need a ridiculous and overpowered battery pack. I basically need a 12S 900w or more pack that will fit on the underside of a 39" longboard. Does anyone know where I could get one of these or any website that makes custom 18650 battery packs?

I know this will take a long time to charge and be VERY heavy, but that is not one of my concerns right not. I'm still not in the building phase so everything may still change. Thanks!
