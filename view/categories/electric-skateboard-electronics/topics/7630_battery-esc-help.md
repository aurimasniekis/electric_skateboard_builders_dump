Hey guys.  First post here. Just wanted some advice from some experienced dyi esk8ers about what battery / esc I should he looking to get with this motor. Alien drybe system 5065 270kv out runner 2200w http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-5065-outrunner-brushless-motor-270kv-2200wa/ . I was orginally planning 2 x 4s 5000mah 10c in series.  Or if I could go for the 2 x 10000mah in series. But finding a 8s esc is a bit annoying,  wanted to know if I could run 6s etc
 Il take any recccomendation. Thanks

Dude ... Use a lipo batter higher than 10c....

Bump it up higher than 25c. The higher the better imo tho people will tell you it's fine....it's not
