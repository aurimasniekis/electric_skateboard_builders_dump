Hi !

I'm looking for a on/off button but I can't seem to find one. I am using 4x3s lipo batteries (12s 5A) in series with a XT90S for the VESC connection. However, I would like to **_press on something instead of having to unplug each time_** I stop riding, I do know that it is best to unplug them but the switch will be used only for a matter of hours. 
Do you have any recommendations ?
