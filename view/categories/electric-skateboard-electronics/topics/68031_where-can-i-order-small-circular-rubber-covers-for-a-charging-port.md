If thats a GX12 jack, just search ebay for GX12 dust cover :) Another alternative would be 3d printing one in TPU or another flex filament

Sorry to hijack but I've also been trying to find one for a 5.5mm x 2.1mm charge port. 

ebay searches turn up nothing but maybe I'm using the wrong search terms. any help greatly appreciated, would feel better if my charge port wasnt exposed all the time
