So I ordered the bench wheel remote from this website: https://www.benchwheel.com/products/remote and it's been about 2 weeks and I haven't received any updates ( about when the item is shipped, status reports ect.). To make things worse they only have an email that they haven't responded to for five days now. Has anyone else had similar issues?

It's Chinese new year, or just was. They should be back at work soon.
