I think they there just released :D I like the idea of 4.1kW from 6380 not 6384 but question whats real length of motor...

Stator is 54mm vs 45mm on their 6374. Not sure about overall length.

Edit: 80mm overall length on the motors

I really like what diy has all teased on the menu for the next bit here.

New Kegel Pulley 12mm and 15mm (in production).
110mm Kegel Style Wheels (in testing).
6.3" x 2" Pneumatic Street Tires (All Terrain Knobby Tires in the future, in testing).
VESC6 (still in testing).
Direct Drive Motors (still in testing).
CNC Precision Trucks (still in testing).
37" Kicktail Deck (made for traditional street ESK8 setups)
38" Downhill Deck (made for 6.3" x 2" Pneumatic Tires)
We got more coming up!!!

Welp there goes at least another grand this summer :stuck_out_tongue:

Thank you guys for all your support!!!

We're working on it as fast as we can...

We should be moving into a bigger warehouse closer to the end of the year so a lot more things to come..! Increasing and improving the support team as well.

@E1Allen - The motors are 80mm in length. We shaved some space off of the casing to accommodate.

If only they had a direct FET ESC. Currently there's a bit of a hole in the market and I'd like to see an alternative to ordering focbox's from Australia or esk8.de controllers.

Glad to know they're working on it!

Already my 90mm abec clones are pretty cushy coming from standard 72mm longboard wheels. At least for pushing

The larger stator definitely means weâ€™ll have more efficient motors that output more torque for the same amount of power, but realistically we wonâ€™t see 4.1 kilowatts of continuous power pushing.

3.6Vnom x 12 Series x 80 amps = 3,456 Watts 


Just wanted to bring this up as a reminder that motor power figures donâ€™t really mean much given all manufacturers test & rate their motors differently.

How would it compare to a 6384 though for MTB purposes?

Do like that it has a 8 mm shaft. Typically, they are 10 at this size or larger.

It is a 6384 just in a smaller size. Same size stator as similar 6384 motors. We made it smaller so it can fit our 218mm Trucks.

How would these compare? @Holyman92 I had planed on 10s(4-6p) w/focbox. Starting to lean 12s5p but worry about running at 12s. Need this board to be really reliable.
Live in a pretty flat town. I'm around 200pounds. Of any of that matters.

im 215lbs, live in pretty flatland texas... i run 10s5p im going to be upgrading to 12s5p here in a few days and 10s is alright it will get you around no problems... 12s is if u REALLY wanna fly lol... which i do... im a speed demon.. anyways the reason these are better is bigger can, bigger stator more torque which us heavier guys need to get moving lol... after the motors get up to speed they are gravy... thats why i ddesigned a Delta/WYE switch... but i keep running into issues

6380... the TB 6380 has the 6384 stator shoved in a smaller can to allow dual setup on their trucks the more copper u have the more current the motor can handle, that motor can handle 4100w of power EACH... so since ur running a 12s with those motors they can handle something like 90amps @ 44.4v, granted u will limit the amp draw to 60, but the point is, u can do it lol

The torque boards VESC. Not their 12s one, this [one.](products/torque-esc-bldc-electronic-speed-controller)
Ask adding some aluminum to the mosfets for some extra thermal mass, and maybe adding a small blower fan to suck air in through a filter in the back of my case.

You can run your 12s4p up to the limit of the BMS if it's not bypassed. Split it between the vesc. So 4p of 30q is 80a. 40a each vesc for battery amps.  You can do 90a each for motor amps no problem.  However if your BMS is 60a you would split that instead.

Going to order 2 silver versions of these motors.  I'm a big guy so the extra torque will be helpful in my case.  I can't wait to build my new build.  Trying to get get all the parts ordered now:

Trampa HolyPro 35Â° 17ply
Superstar hubs.
6.5" tires.
Kaly direct drive.
Kaly 12s4p 20700B battery and enclosure.
TB 6380's.
Flipsky dual VESC but switching to Unity when it arrives.

Totally agree, but with the comment earlier by @Acido saying "if you're going 12s go with FOCBOX only," I figured I would at least bring up the VESC 6 (or VESC 6 clones), as I think it's actually a better option for running 12s than the FOCBOX.

You mean safer because of lower speeds or something else?

I wouldnt trust those clones yet, maybe in a few months im going to try some of them
Better to pay 50$ more later than pay 150$ now and for it to die 
IMO stick with the classic focbox

If it was the flipsky clones I'd agree with you, but I think the ESCape's have been proven to be every bit as good and safe as a Trampa VESC 6, that's my opinion at least..

Most things I would totality agree, and since this is like the 3rd or 4th round of group buys for the ESCape I think that just further reinforces that these are very quality ESC's.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the Focbox limit is 60.000 erpm and the ESCape is 120.000 erpm. So, in theory you need to play in the safe side with the Focbox, around 53.000 erpm which is the limit to effectively using an 8s or 9s battery (with a safe room of around 7.000 erpm not to cross the threshold). I don't know how you can use a 12s battery with a Focbox?? Isn't the ESCape the best and ideal candidate for this scenario??

Most 190kv motors are 170kv when you test them.  60k erpm doesn't apply when running FOC.  Vescs allow you to limit erpm in BLDC.  The number of people running 12s BLDC on this forum is quite high.  90% of the people on this forum don't push the limits anyways. So a focbox is fine.  Even pushing the focbox for those few users it holds up just fine at 12 and even 13s for a few people. So when pushing limits a vesc6 derivative should be better in theory.  But if you're going to slap a 12s6p of 30q or less focbox is fine.

With the exception of that other clone.

B-box, no longer in production.

So far just instability at 12s foc for the dual 4.20 if memory serves me well.

Is there a type of modification that I can make to these to make them as water / corrosion (salt, whatever else) resistant as possible?

I like the little mesh the Haggy motors have on them, would that be applicable here? :thinking:

I dont know if i want these to match my Jenso drive, or if the sealed maytechs (6374 170kv, black) would look or feel better :confounded:
