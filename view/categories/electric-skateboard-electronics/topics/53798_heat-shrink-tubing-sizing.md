Hello guys, I'd like build a datasheet to find the correct heatshrink tubing size for a given number of 18650 cells and silicone wire, hope you guys can help me out, this would be a great source for new/old members to avoid mistakes when ordering online stuff from China.

**Silicone wire gauge vs heat shrink tubing size**
22AWG - 1mm 
20AWG - ?
18AWG
16AWG
14AWG
12AWG - 5mm
10AWG - 6mm

**18650 cell count vs heat shrink tubing size**
1 cell = 29.5mm flat / Φ18.5mm in round
2 cell = 59mm flat / Φ38mm in round
3 cell = 88.5mm flat / Φ56mm in round
4 cell = 118mm flat / Φ75mm in round
5 cell = 147.5mm flat / Φ94mm in round
6 cell = 177mm flat / Φ113mm in round
7 cell = 206.5mm flat / Φ131mm in round
8 cell = 236mm flat / Φ150mm in round
9 cell = 265.5mm flat / Φ169mm in round
10 cell = 295mm flat / Φ188mm in round

Could someone double check my calculations?

I'd like to choose the diameter in round with available commercial sizes

```
Heatshrink usually shrinks in half (2:1)
So I would go around 1.5:1 ratio
