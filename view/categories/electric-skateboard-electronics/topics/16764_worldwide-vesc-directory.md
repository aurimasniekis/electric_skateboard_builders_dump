In preparation for my first build, I made a worldwide list of VESC vendors.

But remember, not all VESCs are created equal: You _may_ get a significantly better quality VESC and/or better service & support by spending a little bit more. (Conversely, there are plenty of happy customers at different price points, so do your research). And remember that this community rocks, so support it when you can.

The lists below are partitioned by region but otherwise are in no particular order.

**USA**
[Ollin Board Company](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com), New Mexico --- $165
[Axle](http://goaxle.com/), New Jersey -- $110
[DIYElectricSkateboard](), Texas --- $99.99
[Miami Electric Boards](https://miamielectricboards.com/), Florida --- $110
[Carvon](http://www.carvonskates.com/), California --- $99 (+ purchase of hub motor)

**AUS**
[Enertion - VESC-x](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/vesc-x-motor-controller/?afmc=hx) --- $168.37

**ASIA**
[Vanda Electronics](https://www.vandaelectronics.com/), Taiwan ---   $98-$110
[Michobby](http://www.michobby.com/product/vedder-vesc-speed-controller/), China --- $99.80 (Maytech)
[E-Greenmotion](http://e-greenmotion.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=111_125), Israel & UK --- $120

**EUROPE**
[Unik](http://www.unikboards.com/), France --- €124.17
[Protoboards](https://www.proto-boards.com/), UK --- £95.00
[Alien Power System](http://alienpowersystem.com/), UK --- £89.00
[Hellray.de/eks8.de](http://www.hellray.de/), Germany --- €139.00-€149.00
[Phoenix Vesc (vesc.co.uk)](http://www.vesc.co.uk/), UK --- €119.99-€129.99
[Faraday Motion](http://shop.faradaymotion.com/shop/18-electronics/4-vesc-motor-controller/), Germany --- €128,99
[Scramboards](https://www.scramboards.com/), UK --- £110.00

Good luck and safe riding to all. If I forgot a vendor, please let me know and I'll update the list!

e-greenmotion, michobby, protoboards and alien resell Maytech VESCs as far as I can tell

The early Maytech VESCs had those stickers on the DRV if I remember correctly.
Probably why he only has two left and the Price is cheaper - wants to replace them with the "newer" version.
I could be wrong though - maybe write him an email and ask to be sure.

Edit: It is a Flier VESC

Hello @Maxid,
New ESK8 Controller was producing this Week.
We must waiting 6 Week of one part the TDK 100V 15my.
But we became it Monday and the production was in process.
So that i hope thats i can take it next week in our shop.
At the weekend i want make a own trade for the ESK8 controller,
with pictures and a list what al we have make another.
But the ESK8 controller based on 4.12 and we have use 
al the improvement from Chacka´s direct vesc.
We have more parts on the esk8C with higher quality.
After we have calculated the price im not sure thats
the ESK8C was the good choice, the cost was exploding 
but we Try to keep the price under 200.-€ for the first 100.
The housing is finished and has the dimensions 68x72x20mm
```

there is currently no Vesc on the market which runs 100% stable with FOC. There are only a few with upgraded components, that are able to keep up better with FOC. But still, they only have a higher chance to survive, while others burn out faster.

It is also in BETA so does not count ;)
Once you finally publish everything and make this available for all of us we will see if FOC is indeed stable.
(I know it probably will be but I find it hard to talk about how awesome something is when you are constantly reminded that it is still in testing)

ZERO DRVs fried in the past 10 months, ZERO VESC SIX killed in BETA, using FOC on 12S.

This is all that has happen so far:

_"So far I have repaired three VESC6 that have failed for various reasons. Here is what went wrong and how to prevent similar failures. I will update this thread if I repair more VESCs that have failed for different reasons._

_Dead MCU_

_I got two VESCs where the STM32F4 had died. The reason was that the ADC inputs for an analog throttle have been connected in parallel. When VESCs are connected to the same battery there will be a voltage differential between them under load due do inductance and resistance in the cables. This voltage differential can reach quite high values and the MCU pins are very sensitive to that. Negative one volt is sure to kill the input and short the whole MCU. The PPM input is slightly less sensitive to this than the other pins as it has a low-pass filter, but it still is a bad idea (the VESC4 had a slower PPM filter and was slightly less sensitive). The CAN-bus can handle around +-60V difference, which is why it should be used on a multi-VESC setup. The CAN-bus also provides other advantages such as cruise control with several motors and traction control._

_Solution: Always use the CAN bus to connect VESCs in parallel and set up the apps accordingly. Never connect the other inputs in parallel in VESCs that are connected to the same battery._

_Dead voltage regulator_

_One of the VESCs that I repaired had a dead 3.3v regulator. One way to kill the regulator is to feed it backwards with a 3.3v source, which has happened to me a few times when connecting a programmer._

_Solution: Never feed the 3.3v net with voltage, only current draw is allowed. If you, for example, have a stlink v2 from ebay that outputs 3.3v on a pin then don't connect that pin - power the VESC from the input while the programmer is connected."_
_Edited by: benjamin on 2017-07-07 11:17_ 


TLDR: No dead SIX so far, other than destroyed by users doing thing you should not do (Y-splitter on -ADC, ST-Link 3.3V).

VESC-Tool will go live mid of August. Actual batch is not BETA any more. 

Frank

I'm new to the eSk8 game and built my first board recently but I can share the experience I've had so far. For my background I was a Master Audi technician and after almost 7 years I moved on to be a Tesla technician where I've been for coming up on five years. That absolutely doesn't mean I know everything about VESCs or the BLDC tool. I ordered most of my parts from  (VESCs, CAN connection, sensor wires, motors, receiver w/controller, and pulley kits). The parts were shipped out to me quickly and seemed like quality parts when I received them. When it came time for me to set them up I asked for help on the Live Chat they have on their website as I didn't receive any documentation with the parts. The guys on there seem nice enough and sent me an email with the recommended VESC settings for BLDC mode. I got that all set up but wanted to use the sensor wires I had ordered for smoother start up torque. The primary VESC would read the sensors but the secondary VESC would fail. I inquired about this on the chat and the person I was working with said I could only run sensored mode using FOC mode. I asked for recommended settings for FOC mode and he sent me a tutorial. After attempting to set up FOC mode and still having the secondary VESC not read the sensors I decided to run it sensorless in BLDC mode so I could ride my new build. When I re-configured it I found that both motors would no longer spin. I got back on the chat and the person I was working with told me then that only a few customers had been able to set up FOC mode successfully. I asked him if otherwise it fries the VESCs and he said "yes".  I was super bummed out that my brand new VESCs now needed to be replaced so he sent me an email to create a ticket to review my build. I started that ticket on 3/19 and have had 3-4 responses only when I get on chat to ask for a response. I'm still trying to work with them to get this issue resolved but it almost seems as if they are ignoring me at this point. So moral of this story so far is if you want fast shipping and what seem to be decent quality parts and you already know how to set up your VESCs by all means order your parts from them. In my case I'm really not sure if I've had worse customer service at this point with any other company, unless they can somehow make things right I will not be buying parts from them again. The last response I got on my ticket was a week ago and the person I was working with said he would be waiting on my response. I have since hit them up on chat almost every day asking for a response and they tell me they will but I have yet to see it.

Hi Aaron,
welcome to the forum!
A bit of a humble start. It´s not necessary to setup foc to run sensors, it should normally work fine in bldc. If you have all your parts from @torqueboards, i´m sure he´s able to check on your ticket and lead you in the right direction :call_me_hand:

Their main goal is "cheap" so I wouldn't count on it.

Maybe they are, but maybe also they push good stuff to market then skimp on the quality control once they're established, like so many china companies.  I personally wouldn't trust them but some folks here have tried the early versions.  Search and there are threads on them.
