I just came home to my first chaka vesc a few minutes ago but I'm having difficulty connecting my vesc to the bldc software. Besides opening the bldc app, what else do I need to do to get it to connect to my vesc? thanks team!

This thread tells you pretty much all the important things you need to know about the VESC.

You need a mini USB cable to connect from the VESC to computer, a power source for the VESC (I use a 6s battery I have laying around), and BLDC tool.

Once they're all plugged in just fire up BLDC tool and find it in the upper right drop down menu and hit "connect". The folders in the picture are the firmware for the various hw revisions of the VESC.
