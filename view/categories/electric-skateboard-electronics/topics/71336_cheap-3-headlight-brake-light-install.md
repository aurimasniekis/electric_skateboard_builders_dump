Bought a ($2.50 white 10w COB LED) for the headlight &  ($0.70 red 2w COB LED) for the break light. Made a harness to connect both LED's to a single 1050mah 3s lipo and it lights up like a Christmas tree! 
I usually get about a good hour or so of light so it's perfect imo. If anyone wants links lmk I'll post them, I'm just currently on my phone and it's a hassle looking for websites URLs because it always reverts to mobile apps. 

Anyway here's a picture of them in action
Lmk what you guys think ðŸ˜Š

To be honest it really depends on the angle you set them at.
But to answer your question at the angle I have them on and 10W output I get about a good 8-10ft of visibility. 
I'm planning on installing this 15w COB LED when it arrives, that way I can shut off my lights really conveniently without any extra hassle & wiring, plus an extra 5w of output should give me a good 10-15 ft

probably 5 feet at most from the looks of it, most lights on boards aren't really meant to see far ahead it's mean to be seen.. to see far ahead i'd recommend a handheld flashlight with a dome for a nice beam shot.

@J0ker3366  Yeah since @never4getf150forums is physically here looking at my deck, he will be able to give you a much better answer :wink: lol 
But he has the right idea about having a light handy.
I always carry a Lumina 500 in my bag & if things seem sketch to me, ie (a lot of pot holes, really crappy roads w/ bumps) I bring that guy out.
