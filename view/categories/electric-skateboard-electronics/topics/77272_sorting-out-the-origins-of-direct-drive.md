It is you that is wrongly assuming.  Of course there's air pressure coming from the front when youre going forward but it's not going to go in that hole no mater how much you carve or how big the wheel is or how fast you're going.    that's the point of contention and an interest of mine and I've done a lot of research, experimenting and modeling of different forced air cooling methods

OMG you're still here? Didn't I say I will move forward with my design regardless of what you say? Go away dude, I don't go in any of you're thread anymore since years ago. But I do notice one thing that hasn't changed. You're still all about....

YADA.....YADA.....YADA!

im still here.  yea I know you said you'd go forward with it and it sounds like a good idea.  the holes seem good.   Feel free to come in any thread of mine as its still the same for years and yada yada continues.

if you had more of a scoop on the other side it will have somewhere to draw from

I‚Äôll deny it.  Yuk yuk.  Stylez on endless sphere gets no credit?


  We didn‚Äôt meet never been the fair.  But we did talk on the phone long ago. I was excited about the direct drive I was almost done using a tacon160, you were doing something unrelated but interested.  It was a disaster design with tiny bearings and I threw it out soon after.  And then stylez on endless sphere made a direct drive and it was with a motor that used a large bearing with the fan inside that was different than any other outrunner around.  He‚Äôd found a motor that was an easy convert and slid right up a lathed hanger.  He had good success with it and showed some cool video. We were all awestruck.  You started your ‚Äú‚ÄùI got a lathe‚Äù thread I think it was called and started making motors with that motor and selling them.  Converting I think sk3 maybe exactly as stylez had shown how in his guide. That‚Äôs how I remember it.

Okay, you're really pushing it. First off, who was that who told you that what you were doing wasn't gonna work....that the magnets were gonna "kiss" the stators? Hmm? It was me. And why did I know that....it was because I was doing something similar, with similar Sk3 motors, although it was a friction drive. If you go to sk8norcal's wackyboards blog, my friction drive board is there. So I know the value of having a big bearing included in the motor because I was using it. If you go to stielz thread, I specifically asked if he was selling it, because I had the same motors and know what it's capable of. He said he didn't wanna make one for others, so I continued with my project. End of story....stop being crazy. 

I worked my ass from hubmotor designs, to V2 with partial motors out design, to now fully motors out design. That's a lot of designing and prototyping. I didn't just grab someone thing, I was already doing it. I just didn't have the lathe. And once I had it and learned it....boom I could machine the trucks myself...all me. And it wasn't stielz design, he epoxied the stator while I used a screw to brace it. So stop tripping, you don't know what you're saying.

That's mine, that had an Sk3 motors in it with skirt bearing. I know those motors already.

Screw or epoxy I‚Äôd hardly say you developed the design out of thin air.  Stylez made it, then you, same motors converted. In that order.  
Unless you‚Äôre saying you were secretly doing it all along and then decided to show it after stylZ.  It‚Äôs all there to see on endless sphere.

But I was already doing the same thing with the same motor also. In those days, only Sk3 came with skirt bearings...duh. I just didn't have the lathe. And to let you know, steilz design was a disaster in the making. So I made the hubmotor design better, last longer.

Honestly, I wished I've never done hubmotors. It seems like all these years, I've only been trying to make them last longer. And this is what I get out of it.

Reminds me of how u freaked out and were threatening me about saying how stylez design, which was yours, was using a 5/16‚Äù axle and 8mm bearings and not typical precision way to do a motor.

But no point. Done for real.  Just letting it known you did not invent it regardless of what u continue to say.  And then say dexter took your idea. Get outta here w that.

@oyta when someone makes claims such as this they‚Äôre not longer claiming to be innovators, they think they invented something, but far from it and respect due to the real originators.  ‚úä 

pics w dates attached. Notice the motors are exactly the same. 

First stielz shows what he made ![image|281x499](upload://m7RgwtZkcjTfPgtHMIu9aK2IJ9K.jpeg)

Hummie laying down the chronological law.

I do however find you two and Jason bickering like children while acting as vendors (fair enough Hummie isn't running a business out of it but still) to be really pathetic.

None of you invented a truck, a wheel or a motor. You moved them around on the truck and it looks like you worked hard at perfecting that, which I respect, but honestly. Innovation worth bickering about here in front of your customers? Probably not.

Just make shit and calm down. The threats and whining help no one.

Decide if you're running businesses or if this is an old school skate friends hobby, you can't really have both.

I've stayed out of it this long. and probably should stay out of it. But you have to understand that John and Jerry come from different angles.

John wants to build cool shit that he wants to ride (not necessarily what others want, i.e. why there's no other wheel sizes yet or sensors), and sells it to the community so they can enjoy it and test it also.

Jerry see's eskate as a business and is always looking to make a quick buck. If he can take something from china, modifying it, and sell it for a profit, he's happy. Jerry understands that to make it as a business though, he needs good designs. But I don't think he see's the value in building his own motors instead of using off the self china motors.

These guys have completely different approaches to solving the same problem.

@LEVer I don't mean any disrespect to you. I still consider you a friend in the eskate world. Both you and John are innovators. But these ideas did all start from the same thread in ES. From that, you've solved a lot of the problems that came up with that design, i.e. innovating, a better direct drive design. John tried this original design, and ultimately, decided to do a hub motor after Jacobs vaporware hub motor failed to deliver.

DD's probably wouldn't be that well known if it wasn't for you Jerry. You took an idea and a design, and worked the hell out of it to make a new drive system better (you worked out the flaws). I respect you for your work in this.

John, because of his personal situation, doesn't have a family to feed, or kids to dress, or xyz. He can live in his own world, developing cool shit and having fun. You both come from different places. But here's another idea... Take all of this passion, and turn it into great products for the community.

With sensors going in hummie hubs this weekend, and Jerry bringing more DD's out, and @torqueboards new DD and The raptor 2 hubs, and more, 2019 will be another great year of innovation.

Do you want to see how your products fair against the competition? Then make sure they are at the Barrett Junction, January 19, 2019...

Haha, great copy and paste the first few iterations without going forward and showing the what difference and major improvements I did from it.

Here are the facts:

* I was doing a Friction Drive with SK3 motors with skirt bearing. It needed a skirt bearing to make sure both ends of the cans are supported. You saw that blog and video. I've been tinkering for a long time.

* Immediately I saw the ease of putting the SK3 motor inside the big wheel that I was using and make it a hub motor. I just didn't have a lathe.

* I saw stielz thread and asked him if he was gonna sell it. He said no and I proceeded with my project.

* I bought a lathe and made my own hubmotors. I did not take the pictures of stielz and go to an engineer or China to have it done. I made my own.

* I made it different because stielz epoxied the stator onto the hanger, which makes it ineffective to service the inside bearing. I used fasteners to make sure I can still remove the stator and service the big skirt bearing.

* After some time, the V1 had  a lot of problems. Then I made V2. Please show me someone who has done that before. In fact, most of the design from today's hub motors came from there, the offset motor (backfire hubs), the not-boring-all-through-the-wheel design and leaving the outside edge (mellow, inboard, raptor, etc.). Then of course V3 and V4.

Now, if you wanna talk about someone who really didn't know anything but just had a mechanical engineer help him (have you paid him yet for his services?), why don't we talk to Marc or username in Endless Sphere "addicted2climbing" to find out who really designed your motor.

The first small hub motors came from Charles of MIT, his website, http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/?page_id=1663.

He was doing it for escooters. I have spoken to him about wanting to do if for a skateboard, this was all when I was still pediglide.

I don't bother designing motors because I have realized early on that the problem lies on designing a new truck. That's what I did and that's what I have done. 

The only difference between today's motors and what we had back then was that now you have different stator teeth and magnet counts. Everything else is the same. But the trucks, especially the axle are very different now.

Your also assuming though that the assemble of motors is all the same. Why is it after you sent me the last dual drive, after not even 100 miles, my motor burnt out? Wasn't the vesc, it was fine and still worked with another motor...

One of the reasons I like johns idea of building motors in house is so we can make sure the right stuff is used in the right way. These guys in the factory are told to do this, do that, they don't understand that the short cut they figured out that saves them time is a Russian rullet that will strike some people later. And they don't care even if it does. They don't care about the quality of epoxies they use or magnets or motor wire or metals even.

I just don't know why you guys pile up on me cause I use off-the-shelf motors. I do that because I know they work already. I just concentrate on the trucks.

Man, you're a straight up troll. I don't know if you're mad at me cause I got out of hubmotors and made DD and now everyone is jumping on that bandwagon, or what.

That's what I meant by coming up with something revolutionary. Or don't you want me to say that cause it's affecting hubmotors. Really, do your thing. If you think hubmotors are fine then do it, prove it, offer it, anything really. Just don't stop people from innovating. You're so sour.

EDIT:  Or is because of the YADA, YADA, YADA part? Lol

I can't speak for hummie (and he yells at me everytime I do, haha), so I'm not.

I don't mean to team up on you and pile you down. Just want to make sure you put custom motors on your radar! I want to see you succeed.

In our case, the truck wasn't as important, as we can use off the shelf trucks. Direct drives can't and really do require a custom truck. This meant a lot of the focus was on wheel and how that interfaces, as well as the motor itself, in our case.

I feel you. I've been pushing john to formalize a business like yours for 2 years now, and it's not any closer to happening. Without starting from something, you can't make a profit to make tomorrows thing. Johns solution was just time (to make money from working) and pre-orders to make it happen. But now it's the same situation for the next batch, where's the money coming from? Only option now is a kickstarter, but that means formalizing a business.

I just want to make sure you don't forget about the motor and it's importance in the drive!

Oh @fliess and his wonderful watermarked pics.  Nice direct drive motors too if I'm not mistaken.  

Seriously @LEVer well done you made the first commercially available (if somewhat delayed) direct drive motors  @Hummie your excellent product speaks for itself but please if you want to continue flirting with each other get a room.

You obviously have enough time to write countless messages to keep this childish fight with Hummie alive. Yet apparently responding to your customers is not worth your precious time.
No offense, but it's a bit annoying to be still waiting for the SDXL I ordered on Carvon website in november 2017. In this context, your total lack of communication with your customers but apparent absolute priority to defend your rights on an internet forum feels at best quite disrespectful.

My order is #1041

It obviously has a point , now the way they‚Äôre going about it may be to the disliking of many but to say it doesn‚Äôt have a point is ludicrous Should carvon be credited with being the original creator of DD ? Or Should Stylez ? *Should I?*

 In any other setting it would be a good debate , and just because it‚Äôs between two vendors (in a not so friendly manner) doesn‚Äôt mean it shouldn‚Äôt happen. Screw the whole ‚Äúomg stop your both vendors act like business‚Äù They‚Äôre people. Men. They have a issue with one another‚Äôs claims and are doing so in a manner they they both consent to by continually engaging in. Not a single business on here is conventional and should be forced to convene to conventional standards. If one does it like it , then one does not have to engage in any product that the participating vendors is and will sell. But we have to stop acting like any vendor on here is going to conduct themselves or restrict themselves in any manner for our sakes. 

And let‚Äôs not act like it‚Äôs degrading the forum as if there aren‚Äôt hundreds of other conversations and history worth of knowledge on here that maintains its value. Fights happen , disagreements happen. If one don‚Äôt like it , don‚Äôt watch , don‚Äôt read. But come on people , we really need to stop acting like vendors aren‚Äôt going to bump heads, aren‚Äôt going to have opinions, and aren‚Äôt going to express those opinions whenever they wish.

I'd say neither one is a business in the true sense of the word and I don't remember saying they were or indeed for either of them to start behaving like one.  Hummie is a guy making cool shit and selling at hardly any profit.  In fact he hijacks his own profit margin at every opportunity.  Jerry is a guy that has a lot of dissatisfied customers and as I understand is slowly working his way through the backorders.  Good for him.  The point I was trying to make is,  does anyone really care? 
As a community it is our responsibility to maintain a healthy reading experience for all concerned.  This is not a fruitful thread and contains absolutely nothing of value and just reflects badly on all of us to new people.  Thats why this topic is pointless.  

By the way this is not a debate and I don't want to get drawn into making the thread even worse than it is but you called me ludicrous and I hate that guys music.

I love reading the clashes of titans and vendors on this forum. They wan't to be heard and I'm here to listen. Either to attack or defend others or themselves.

It feels like seeing peaces of origin from the whole esk8 scene. I can see where the sweat and tears were put in and how setbacks and competition are dealt with. Without this I would have less feeling for the vendors. They would just be websites with products that were reviewed here. Now there's personality behind each brand. My hope for them to succeed is only growing.

I still hate downtime, delivery times, quality control etc. from smaller players. But I would much rather buy from LEver, Hummie, Torqueboards, and @onloop  (where the fuck you at brah) then from Boosted or Evolve. That's mostly because of this forum.

And this is where I severely disagree because what cosnittuties as a healthy reading experience ? Sunshine and rainbows ? A whole thread of people saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs totally awesome bro!‚Äù , shit should i avoid @onloop post cause they‚Äôre Rated R for politenes?  And even more so why should ones reading experience be dictated by what others call healthy? I for one find value in see the origin of Direct Drive from two ex-endless peered forum makers, and that aside I gain value from seeing vendors as raw as they are , no fluff , no business make up or bullshit. Just Straight up tell em at em. I value moments like these because business can be a contract and you want to understand the human your about to shake with , at their best AND at their worst.

I think it is useful though as it shows the level of passion they both have. You can see the passion pouring out of them here...

Most will just scroll over this thread because it has no value to them. Why should they censor their feeling? I argued many times with Jason, so what? In the end, I think we both respect each other more because we took a position and defended it to our graves. Even if we don't both agree in the end, we come out with a different perspective.

That's the whole point of the forum. It's not just to inform and provide material for n00bs but to drive the industry forward. Does this do that? Maybe, maybe not. Who are you to say it doesn't though?

Better served by pm because as you said its about the 2 of them.

If you like to watch two respected members of the community go at it hammer and tongs over something that really doesn't matter in the scheme of things then go right ahead guys.  Get your popcorn memes out and crack on.  I personally find it a bit sad tbh.  I'm out.  Enjoy.

To play de devil's advocate I'd say that the production nightmare experienced by @Lever and it's following failure to deliver on time is directly linked to the content of this thread. 
This ultimately let a market in need for direct drives with a lack of offer, and it's the exact reason why more and more manufacturers are now starting to sell similar products - it consequently pissed off Lever, accusing competitors from stealing an idea - which started this debate. 

But can we really blame the competitors? It's how free market works - theres a feedback loop between demand and offer and the competitors answer to the market needs was more than foreseeable.

Lever's lack of answer to his customers posting in the two other threads also might also tend to incentivize the hijack of the ones where he's active, and at the same time incentivize other manufacturers to work on setting up the production of their own version of direct drives.

So arguably, the popcorn memes are way more off topic, but I nevertheless sincerely apologize for bending the forum rules irresponsibly.

 This difference of opinions here has nothing to do with anything in 4 years. Just as we all look for nerdy opportunities to correct people on favorite eskate science stuff I‚Äôve been around long enough to tell the legit history and not have it recreated for marketing.   The issue was singular: the history of direct drive.  
No one is attacking lever regardless of how he feels. There‚Äôs one contested point alone.  We should probably drop the one point since there‚Äôs literally pics showing above and it should be cleared up
I‚Äôm dropping it but people keep talking about it.  dont speculate or complicate it and the thread has one title

He‚Äôs an awesome guy made lots of awesome stuff....in fact!!!...you can see his fantastic guide on how he made a direct drive in maybe 2012 or 2013 on there.
