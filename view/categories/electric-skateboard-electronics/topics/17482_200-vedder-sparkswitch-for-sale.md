So I ordered  200 sparkswitches from osh park (chakas 1.4 revision) they had a silk screeen issue  and sent me an a whole  extra 200  they'd come assembled  with all smd components soldered for 28$ and with led switch for 35$ and an extra 5$ for a back mounted heatsink . <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/3/83f7e76f1398e4e13a9d9a811d11b47ab43d4ac8.png" width="281" height="500">

I'll have 200 for sale as the initial 200 were already planned with. I have to order the exra smd components. But the boards would come fully assembled. The switch would have to be  connected through the hole you're mounting it in. If necessary I can add xt90 connectors and awg10 wires but that'd be extra.

So what are you doing with the 200 defective boards?  You say you already had plans for them, but how do we know we are not the ones buying the boards with the silkscreen issue?

Do you know what the silkscreen is or are you just assuming  its an actual  issue?  The traces on the boards I just got are 100% fine but just to give peace of mind the silkscreen is the white lettering and descriptive part of the board. The initial  "bad" ones are already  mostly handed out to the people  who wanted them. I can ship to the "US and Europe will find out prices today  and hand carry them to anywhere in Korea
