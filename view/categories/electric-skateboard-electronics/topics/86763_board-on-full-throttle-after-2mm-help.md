Hello there,

I currenty build my first DIY board but i have yet again some issues. I'm not sure how to extend the throttle curve. Currently the Motor spinns at full speed after about 2-3mm of movement. Thats 1/3 of the thumbwheel. How to i extend the curve so full throttle is only when the wheel is at the end? (Same basically for the brakes)

Vesc 4.12

TB 6374

12S2P

What infos do you need if any?

Did you adjust your pulswith according to your remote?
I mean did you go through the ppm wizard?
```

Can you show screenshots of the PPM mapping and PPM Throttle curve?

yes. Brake is 100. Full throttle is 100 and nothing ~0. by ppm wizard you mean "Setup Input"?

@Jarno Here you go.

EDIT : I played a bit with the throttle curve but from hearing it, it didn't change anything major.

Exactly this.
Which remote you use?
Do you have different speed modes, and if yes in which you made the confirmation?
```

I'm guessing you are not standing on you board while trottling? I think it may be that once your motor starts running without a real load it can go to max ERPM with a small current i.e. not max trottle. Can you try to do a duty sweep (Experimental tab) and see what happens?

I use the 2.4ghz Nano remote. I don't have different speed mode, but i want them if possible. A seperate reverse function would be cool too. (Not the Boosted board style)

To do this make the trottle curve this:

correct. It was an empty load while testing it out.

duty sweep just "clicks" as if the Motor is unsensored and doesn't know which way to go.

Can you try the other tests?

```
Do you test the speed on a "bench" setup or while riding the board?

With a VESC you typicly control power (current) and not the speed, like a real car.

So you may reach the max speed of your setup with half throttle/power, but on full throttle your acceleration is faster.

But as some already mentioned, you can also modify the power gain per % on the remote by software.

My only way to test it is to unplug it and take it outside (not now because it starts raining) Or inside my room where i can move 1 1/2 Meters.

What everyone is trying to say is that if there is nobody standing on the board when you push the throttle (the wheels are not on the ground), it will always go full speed no matter your position on the throttle.

So itâ€™s not this one?
![image|327x500](upload://gWLmHR4mNdVVKLlptezBwmDQlr3.jpeg) 

Reverse is no problem, just change your drive mode in the vesc settings to current reverse with breaks. Donâ€™t nail me on the exact naming.

## \#16 Posted by: xsynatic Posted at: 2019-03-10T14:15:33.992Z Reads: 59

Yes, thats the one.

I only can use reverse modes with the boosted style of reverse (Which i don't like) or no reverse at all.

So i have to adjust the throttle curve and stand on the board the maybe see a difference.

How about Reverse and Speed modes? The remote itself has a seperate reverse button and a speed mode switch mode i don't know if i can program these.

[/quote]

What you mean with it? 
You want to go reverse only after switching the button?

[quote="xsynatic, post:17, topic:86763"]
speed mode switch

Now you have speed modes? ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚
Make sure you did the mapping in the fast mode.

yes, i only want throttle and brake on the thumbwheel. Activating Reverse via the button.

The remote has a switch for speed modes. It doesn't make any difference between those 2.

```
Speed mode on the controller works as follows:

In fast mode the ranges of you controller are big.

In slow mode the range is limited.

If you setup in slow mode and switch to fast mode you get to your max at say 50% of full trottle.
```

---
## \#25 Posted by: xsynatic Posted at: 2019-03-10T14:33:34.824Z Reads: 45

```
So doing the setup with the fast mode automatically limits the "slow" mode to 50%?
```

You need to stand on the board and it will be fine as long as you do the following:

- Program the controller via the PPM wizard
- Turn the remote on before the board and the push to full throttle and then full brake then turn the board on.


The stock throttle curve should be fine and make sure you run the wizard with the board in fast mode. The slow mode switch will limit throttle to 70% for both Acceleration and Brake.
```

It will limit the slow mode to something.

Now i got it. Thanks. Any idea about the Reverse problem? The nano remote has a seperate reverse button which i want to use but don't know how to enable.

It can be done but you need Acks firmware and to pug in a PPM channel to another remote. Honestly I don't recommend using reverse to begin with. You may one day hit it whilst at 50kmh and not have a good time or even just from the standstill and have a bad time.

Thats why i like the hobbywing ESC where if you are faster than 3km/h nothing happens.

But ok, reverse is not a must but would be cool. But I'll lay it on ice for now. Thanks for the help!

Itâ€™s similar with vesc. Faster than 3km/h round about and your wheels will not spin backwards, even if you hit full negative throttle.

make sure your board has some sort of load. some vescs spin up to max rpm if the wheels are not on the ground and experiencing some sort of resistance

@Jarno @Friskies I got it to work and it feels pretty good. But guess what. The Magnet retaining Ring came loose. So, no riding for me for a while.

what was the issue? how did you fix it?

about the retaining ring, just battle harden the bell.
better than directly from both.

The issue was the non adjusted throttle curve and that i tested it with no load. I still reach full throttle before the end but its much nicer now. I've contacted support already. Not sure if i have that much trust in my skills to do it. Would be pretty nice though.
