10s with 14:27 gearing. 

Any reason why this is not going to be a beast?

1) make sure you have the batteries and ESC to provide enough current
2) there is no good reason to use a 14T motor sprocket and stretch out the gearing so dang tall

Are you planning on using one or two of those motors? Battery specs?

I have a board exactly like this. Same motor and gearing on 83mm wheels. It uses an eBay esc. The acceleration and brakes suck. 

It’s being upgraded to a 10t sprocket for more torque and probably a vesc soon too

After much deliberation I am going to see how it goes single motor

@SJG717 These batteries x5 

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-2s-7-4v-60c-hardcase-pack-roar-approved.html

I am open to using an sk3 or sk8 if that may be better

@Jmding the gearing is a bit weird it just what comes with the pack i could always change the ratio later

Make sure to use a vesc. It is not much more cost wise and opens up so many more options

I think that should be reasonable. The main influence on torque output is motor amps. That why my board with this is so low on acceleration because the eBay esc is only rated for about 20a

Hk vesc s are a nice strong unit and both sk3 and sk8 are great motors.  Depends whether you want sensors is all.  The warranty though well that is in another league to any other vendor.  They are so big they can afford to be pretty flexible with returns.  Half the time they don't even want the defective shit back.  They'll give you the opportunity to open it up and look in the case of motors and take pics etc.

It'll probably have enough torque to go up a 2.5% grade hill

Erm, if you are gonna use the 100mm wheels you will need to change the gear ratio. It will be stressing the motor at that gearing. I’d search eBay for 6.35mm roller chain and find a 11 or 12t sprocket to swap it with. I swapped to a 10t on my 12s board and still hit 60km/h
```

## \#19 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2018-12-15T06:17:39.717Z Reads: 78

Yes, with current gearing and 100mm wheels. With a 10t it will be very powerful

this is basically my main concern / so if i just switch the gearing it'll be able to handle 20% + hills?

haha that's cool even 10% is not good enough really but if i got 9t or 10t good to know it'll boost - top speed not as high of a priority

Lol, 2.5% is barely even a slope. I ride this same set up now and it definitely climbs more than that, granted I’m on 83mm

Yeah my post above was sarcastic lol

All jokes aside my 15:36 on 83s were able to climb some pretty steep hills, main problem was the traction on those stupid chinese thanes

:joy: it's definitely easy to get lost with the sarcasm

as long as all i really need to do is change the gearing to get the results i'm stoked with that!

i'm using 100mm MBS wheels so hopefully the traction will be better then thanes

Unfortunately the mbs wheels traction isn’t always great due to the small contact patch from the stepped wheel

The internet is such a great place haha 

You should be able to get plently of torque if you gear it right, and also the 100mm mbs are just a tad bit better than chinese thanes, if chinese thanes score 6/10 and abecs 9/10 the mbs would be 6.5/10

For torque, 15Nm is a ton of power and 5Nm is not much power.  So 6.9Nm will be on the weak side.

Don’t forget this is on a short board, plus at 60a it would produce 8Nm and increasing higher would provide even more

Wait, I didn't even see that.  It says 124km/h (76.9mi/h)

Are you sure you filled it out correctly?  Do you have a snapshot of the values you put into the calculator?

Nominal cell voltage on LiPo is around 3.7V/cell.  The "2S" will double that.... lower that to 3.7V

Yeah that's too much top-end and not enough torque.  Try adjusting the gear ratio a bit with smaller motor gear or bigger wheel gear or smaller wheels.

4.6Nm is rideable but will feel weak.

Try increasing wheel gear
