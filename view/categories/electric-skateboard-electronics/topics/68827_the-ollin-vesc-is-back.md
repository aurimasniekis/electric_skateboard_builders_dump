I spent hours reading and researching and came to the conclusion that your product was the one I wanted and just as I was about to pull the trigger you up and disappeared on me.  Don't know if I can forgive that blatant disregard for my repetitive eye strain to be honest.
:wink:
Welcome back and now it seems I have to change plans again or just build another one.  
Good to see a great product back in the community!

It is the updated VESC 4.12 that is made with Direct FETs and a bad ass heat sink for better thermal management.  And it is made in the USA, which I think is pretty awesome.   Fully FOC compatible.

Thanks Scrapheap, 

We are really happy to offer the VESC again to DIY builders and extremely excited to offer our new hollow core deck.  I cannot give too many detail yet but what I can tell you is the deck easily holds 60 cells and is lighter than the original FreeRide deck.  We have been working hard on this and can't wait to give the full details. Until then, here is a nice side profile shot of the new deck we posted on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ollinboardco/?hl=en).

Micro USB sucks ballsack and Mini USB is awesome.  That may have something to do with it.

For the real win, switch to USB C.

Anyone designing any NEW hardware with Micro USB should have their head checked

I assume you hate micro-b's in general so I'll ask you this,
how are micro-USB connector's bad for new vesc's or existing vesc's like the focbox?

[quote="Blitz, post:27, topic:68827"]

[/quote]

They're bad because they always stop working after some amount of time and get to where you have to wiggle them, and they only work *while* you're wiggling them.  As soon as you let go, they disconnect again.  Literally every single one I've ever had.  On something like an ESC that doesn't matter as much, but on a skateboard remote or a phone that is a disaster.

By far the best are Mini USB (but physically *a tad* large) and USB C

Of course USB A is better than all those but they are too big for most applications.

When would it come to pass? Be it at the end of the world?

Your micro-USB connectors, jacks, cables don't brake because of sheer time but rather
because you (If i'm not mistaken) casually  plug them in and plug them out.
But when it comes to your vesc's you don't need to casually plug them in and out,
and in my case I only had to plug my focbox in and out once.

```
Micro-USB was designed to wear out the cable first rather than the connector. Micro USB are also much more abundant and readily available than mini. The amount you plug the cable into the vesc shouldn't damage anything. It's not like you have to charge through micro USB.

USB C vesc has got to be on the horizon

We use that connector like 10 times in the esc's lifetime. Mini/micro usb is up to the task and it's cheaper than type c. I'd say cheaping out on that connector is not a bad choice.

@Wraith  there is a good chance we will be releasing more photos and details of the new FreeRide deck later this week if everything goes smoothly for the guys in the shop. I will make a new thread to announce the new deck as soon as we are ready to go, so keep an eye out.

@ElskerShadow  we will be offering integrated batteries with the decks domestically, for international customers we are still working on finding a solution to the high cost associated with shipping batteries internationally. 

@b264   thank you for clearing up the micro USB verses the mini USB. I spoke to @chaka and his response was nearly identical to yours. To answer the question of USB C, Jeramiah said it is a little overkill for a single VESC but he is considering it on future iterations of the VESC and integrated FreeRide deck. 

@briman05  thanks, I remember how much time Jeramiah use to spend on this forum, I will do my best to fill his shoes!

Ollin VESC'S KILL IT. Ive pushed these escs hardd and they push back. I would highly  recommend them! $450 for the pair was okay, but with the price drop their even better! 
I swapped these two out with flipskys before I sold my board..hehehe

@PeterKay we suggest using a maximum voltage of 12S Li-Ion,the peak voltage of the hardware is 60 volts. Our VESC features direct FETs and an aluminium enclosure/heat-sink so it is capable of 80 amps continuous and 150 amps max.

@pixelsilva we are working on bring motors available to builders again. At the moment our supplies are limited but we will definitely make them available again. 

@Eboostin I will be making a thread on the hollow core deck soon.

Those are available from uniqualis. I'm not sure if they have it on their online store, but you can email them and get a quote. 52 USD each. I know they're guaranteed readily available in 200kv, but I'm sure 170kv is also a standard in stock there.

Also tagging @b264 since you seemed interested.
