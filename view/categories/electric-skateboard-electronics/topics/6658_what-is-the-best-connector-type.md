Hey guys,

I was wondering what is the best connector type. The LiPo batteries i am ordering have 5.5mm bullet connectors but i find the XT60/XT90 to be more common, from series connectors to parallel chargers and so on. 

but i am wondering if 5.5mm Connectors are better or what are the benefits between them as i see many LiPo batteries with 5.5mm connectors.

Also what do you guys think of adapters. I found some 5.5mm bullet to XT90 adapters so you don't have to solder, but do you think they would work? or are there some incompatibilities?
