Hi guys! 
So im going to put my 12s4p battery from torqueboard on my raptor 2.1 kit (drive kit+unity), i see they have lot of motor heat problem on 10S battery , i am asking myself if 12S will be terribly more hot than with 10S  ?? 
If i keep the same motor amp will it be ok?
Am i just better to get a 10S battery?
Thanks!

I don’t think it will get “terribly hot”, a lot of people are using the hubs with 12s, although the 2.1 Raptor itself is 10s. The hubs also have the upgraded axel with the heatsink, so you should be more than fine with 12s

Heat will be abit less on 12S. Higher voltage equals lower current drain = less heat.  

P = U x I, U = R x I -> **P = R x I^2** 

Regarding voltage level, they probably work on hundreds of volt. Voltage isnt what will kill the motors.
