I got @goldenHusky antisparks switches a couple of days ago, now I'm trying to figure out how to connect the led push button to the switch, even though the switch has the indication, the button does not. I'm using @torqueboards led button couldn't decypher which pin is what.

Anyone could help me out here?

This is the switch I got:

Hi,

sorry for the delay.
You can't use TBs LED switch with my antispark switches because his LED switches aren't SPDT, therefore they don't have the required C, NO, NC configuration of the pins.

To add on to goldenhusky, the SPDT type switches you're looking for has 5 pins usually. The one in your picture only has 4.
