I know this is such a trivial question and will get bood for asking this but I'm not clear on one thing, do we need to have a battery management system (BMS) in between our battery and V/ESC's? It's required to ensure each single 18650 battery gets charged the same?

Please use the search bar there are many topics about this.

Short answer is **_yes_**

I would disagree with @AlanZhou. 
It's important to balance your cells at every charge, true. 
This can be accomplished with a BMS, but it can also be accomplished with a balance charger.

to quote from the [beginner's guide](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wiki-a-beginner-guide-to-diy-an-esk8/46844) (pinned at the top of the forum):

> When charging a battery it’s very important that all the cells stay at the same voltage and never go higher than 4.2V/cell. To do that you will need a balance charger or a BMS (battery management system). The balance charger needs to know which voltage each cell has to be able to “balance” each cell equally, that’s why the most battery packs have a balance wire (look bellow). The bigger wires are for charging and discharging, they are thicker because they need to conduct more current.

Well yeah but I think what the guy is trying to ask is, if a bms is needed at all and can he just charge through the main leads without a bms and will the cells go out of balance

He's not asking anything about a balance charger...

it's better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.

unless you have a way to manually bring your pack to balance, it's highly recommended.

fresh quality liion cells drains uniformly so maybe you can get away without a bms.  ppl running bigass packs (6p+) report very little drift even after many cycles.

lipo i would balance every charge, they degrade quickly and fall out of balance fast.  i fixed a lipo pack once for someone on here and after a single discharge cycle, i saw 0.2v drift.
