Hi all,
I want to build a battery pack consisting of 30 Samsung 20-r 's. I am using plastic holders to hold the batteries together and will be using a spot welder. The 10s3p configurations will output 66 amps so I need to know how thick nickel strips are required. If anyone can help or offer another viable solution I would greatly appreciate it.
