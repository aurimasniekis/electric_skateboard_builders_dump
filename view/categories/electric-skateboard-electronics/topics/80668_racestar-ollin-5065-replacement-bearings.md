A couple of my Racestar/Ollin 5065 motors are making weird clicking sounds, so I think they need a bearing change. Does anybody know the size/model of the two stacked bearings that sit between the sleeve and hall sensor, at the rear of the motor?

This is really common on these motors. Mines do the same clicking sound. Maybe @chaka knows.

Most of mine have the same clicking sound, I don't know what it's from, but it's never caused a failure.  I thought it was loose magnets, but no magnets are loose.  I've just accepted clicking as a hallmark of Racerstar motors.

They're not bad for how light and cheap and small they are, so :man_shrugging:

Historically racerstars are a good little motor.  I've only used them in rc but good none the less.

Good to know this is a common issue that doesn't case failures. It would be interesting to find out the exact cause though. The rear bearings look really undersized so I assumed it might be them @b264?

I'm not sure, I never did figure it out and stopped trying to.  I'd love to know

So thats where the noise comes from, I get it only when im turning and breaking a bit harder

Mine only goes away when there is a tiny bit of throttle or a tiny bit of brake applied.  On full power or full brake or on idle, it's there.

Yes, that exact same sound.  I haven't been able to quash it.

Check that you havenâ€™t got a short to ground from one of your phase wires. Check the screw that goes into motor near where the cables leave the body of the motor.
