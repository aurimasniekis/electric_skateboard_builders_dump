Hi,

I am searching for some VESC PCBs for self soldering, because of some trouble with the manufacture I ordered my 4 Layer PCBs from.
It would be good if there is someone in Europe or best in Germany, but also international would be ok when the shipping costs are ok.

Hope someone can help me.

Regards

Check with this guy if he still got them.

Thanks for your link, but I know this source and he is selling them for 14,16 Us-Dollar per piece.
One can get 10 for 72 Dollar here: [Hackvana][1]
So that would be around 7 dollar per piece and I don't know why this guy think he can double the price.
I don't need 10 so i am asking if someone sells 1-2 pieces for a fair price.
And to this 14,16 Dollar one must also add shipping costs, because I live outside the UK.

Ah, i didn't know the price on them, just remembered hos post.
But yes, double price seems a bit steep.

Might wanna check on the Endless Sphere forum as well if you havn't already.

Why don't you buy 10 from hackvana and sell off what you don't need?

Alternatively, there's a guy on ES selling complete VESCs in Germany, perhaps he'll sell you a couple blank PCBs ?

That was my plan to order 10 and then I had the idea maybe there is someone ordered 10 and want to sell a few.

Looks like I must write more information in the thread opening post next time, because I already contacted elkick via PM. :D But thank you both for the tip to contact him.

What do you mean with France or Germany for you? And we are talking about non soldered PCBs. I am just saying, because in an other forum someone thought we talk about assembled ones.

Maybe one can then also think about ordering from Mouser/Farnell together to come over 25 FETs or so to lower the costs.

Yes, I am also looking for PCBs only.
I am in France ... so a german (or least EU) supplier would be better that US or aussie one.

Get them from oshpark. You cannot beat the quality of their PCB's and the gold plated pads are much easier to solder. Comes out to around $39 for a batch of three but I have no idea what international shipping charges they have.

@akira So you are just interested in PCBs and not in the electronic pieces, right? To the PCB ordering thing. I think with an European/German PCB manufacture at a low quantity you are definitely over 25€ or more for one 4 Layer PCB. So when cost plays a role one should definitely order overseas.

@chaka I don't really like their solder mask color and I think 13 Dollar per piece isn't that cheap, but for the quality (ENIG and not HASL) a lot better then the offer of @Jack .
Looks like international shipping from osh park without tracking information and slow shipping is free.

I've got 8 spare PCB's form an order at smart-prototyping. The lettering on the solder mask is alright, and they're blue in color. It'll be a couple days but I can get some pictures and figure out shipping costs if people are interested, would probably sell them for $10 a piece.

From germany reichelt and/or mouser would probably be the best alternative.

Holy cow! That is a great offer. Thank you a lot. :smiley: I think the V4.8 is also a good start into the VESC world and at the time I want actually order my first PCBs there was version 4.7 the newest. :smile: 
Do you have tested one of the PCB of this batch if the design is working in general?
So I think I will order my pulleys/belts also at your shop and then you can ship it together?

@akira Ok cool. For how many VESCs you need the parts? Just to have an quick overview. Would you be also ok for "shipping cost free" V4.8 PCBs?

For anyone who wants the version 4.8 PCB just pay the postage here: http://www.enertionboards.com/how-to-build-eboard/postage-charge/

**Write a note saying "send me 6 vesc 4.8 pcb"**

Pay the shipping & ill send a sheet of six to each person free of charge (only pay the shipping cost).

The version 4.8 PCB are perfectly fine & working, there is very little difference between 4.8 & 4.10

Oh that is a little bit disappointing, but I can understand that.

To all the people who have written me, I am very sorry but please note that I can then not ship them from Germany just for shipping costs to you. I will then order V4.11 PCBs from an other source but I think the new version is also worth it.

I have now ordered VESC V4.11 ESCs by myself. If anyone is interested in them I will sell them for around 7€ excl. shipping, but final price when they arrived here and the taxes and duty are payed.

Also if others are interested in the electronic parts group buy just contact me.

Will repost about the costs here also, because I got some PMs.
> I am planning to buy my electronic parts in the next week and have already found two guys which are interested in ordering together.
> Some VESC V4.11, Anti-spark-Switch, Capacitor and Nunchuk PCBs are on the way to me.
> Octopart gives out "USD 66.07 each" (netto price) for the electronic parts right now. Hope to get that down a little bit, but for a full kit that will then be something like USD 66.07*1.19 (19% taxes) + around USD 7 (PCB) = USD 85 with PCB and all parts I think. Must look into the electronic parts order more in detail. But maybe here are also others interested in it and as more we are as lower the costs become.

I have now also put parts for 10 VESCs in my mouser  [shopping cart] [1] as a test. To this come also 19% taxes on top and around 7€ per 4 Layer VESC PCB.

Hey agpouso,

that should be possible, but I think the shipping to spain with tracking is around 15€ (the tracking so no one can say they didn't receive their package). At the moment it looks like we are around 80€ for one VESC self solder set with PCB.
Please write me back if you still are interested, because a guy with 4 VESC sets didn't answer back since weeks so I think he is out.

Here are some pictures. Takes a lot of time...
In the picture you see the electronic parts for a set of two VESCs.

Does this offer still stand?  Also do you know where I could get a parts list for this version and the firmware and all of that.  I am new to e-skateboards and basically have everything ready just don't have the esc's yet.  I just finished making my own reflow oven and would like to try make my own esc's.

You can find the BOM on Vedder's GitHub. You need to convert the ods file to a xlsx file using an online converter. Then import the xlsx file into mouser and element 14 and order the parts.

K I have found the parts list but wasn't sure if that is the same for old boards.  I live in the US and digi key is in my town so I will probably go there for all the parts they have all of them but a few.  I will have to post that list and see if I can find similar parts.  I know the Mosfets were out of stock.

Sorry for the late response. I don't know if I have done the calculation here also, but all parts with PCB for one VESC v4.11 are 80€. So the dual set is 160€. Don't forget that one must also add shipping costs. I will only ship with tracking number and insured shipping.
I think the most infos you can found on this thread: [http://www.elektro-skateboard.de/forum/vesc-104/vesc-platinen-bauteile-sammelbestellung-5014.php](http://www.elektro-skateboard.de/forum/vesc-104/vesc-platinen-bauteile-sammelbestellung-5014.php)

## \#43 Posted by: hexakopter Posted at: 2016-04-15T21:56:49.501Z Reads: 107

Then it would be a completed VESC and not a set with electronic parts and PCB right? So no, it is just the price of the parts as you can see in the calculations. When ordering in little quantity the price for the parts is high, so not comparable to sources like enertion.
