So I've been away from my build for quite a few months and still need to wire everything together. Its a 10s2p setup with a 10BMS, I haven't bought a charger yet as I'm not sure which one will suit me best for charging all batteries at the same time but I'm thinking of a 42v hover board charger. How do I wire this lot? I've posted a picture of what I've got all words and picture edits appreciated, thank you ![IMG_20190317_144249|666x500](upload://u90O7UP1TSwoTGWl9fTEaNYF2GL.jpeg)

A 2-4 amp 10s charger should work for you as long as the socket on your pack  matches the plug on the charger.
