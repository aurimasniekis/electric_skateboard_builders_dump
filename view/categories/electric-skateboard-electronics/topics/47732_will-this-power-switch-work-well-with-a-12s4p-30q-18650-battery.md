maybe. 

I used this exact switch on my 12s4p and it burned out in about a month. 

used another switch, that kind of burned out after a few months. 

but there are those who are rocking these switches on their 12s builds with no issues. 

Ive lost faith in anti spark switches and have gone to anti spark loop keys.

Interesting.  Sad to hear it failed for people.

On 12s I use these exclusively. But those I buy cost more from the manufacturer. Could be parts could be Bulk discounting...
Pretty sure emcotec came up with these and the rest are chinese copies that may or may not be decent.
Emcotec charges 75$ for them.

should work as it says 6s-16s lipo and 70v is more than enough for a 12s
