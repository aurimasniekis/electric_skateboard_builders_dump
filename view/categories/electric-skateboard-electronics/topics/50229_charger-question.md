Hey guys, I just got done building a 12s4p battery from 18650 cells and a 60amp supower BMS.  I have a charger from my ebike that is 58.8v while my pack is 12s so it maxes out 50.4 (assuming 4.2v for each battery).   Could I use this charger without damaging my battery?  It says:  Output: 48VDC/3A(Vmax:58.8V) on it.

Thanks.  I will assume the answer is no until someone replies otherwise.

12s4p pack, you built that.
12s BMS, you hook that.
50.4v charger, you buy that.

I wouldn't use that charger if I were you. :kissing_heart:

I agree,  I thought this charger was 48v until I measured it.  Now I am stuck trying to find a good charger that ships to me quickly.
