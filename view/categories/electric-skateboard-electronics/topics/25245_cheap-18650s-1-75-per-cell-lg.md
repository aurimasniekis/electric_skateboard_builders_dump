NOT LG's.

getting legit cells can be a challenge - remember if it's "too good to be true" - it's likely for a reason.

Performance of fake cells can be <5a per cell... which wouldn't work well for esk8.

HTH - GL!

Not enough discharge. If you wanna go cheap go lipo and if money isn't problem then buy decent 18650 cells like 30Q.

Lower discharge amperage, meaning they are not good for eboards, if you put enough in parallel sure it will be enough but at that point the cells will run pretty hot. Also can't completely tell if the cells are legit or not. If it sounds to good to be true, it's because it usually is :wink:
