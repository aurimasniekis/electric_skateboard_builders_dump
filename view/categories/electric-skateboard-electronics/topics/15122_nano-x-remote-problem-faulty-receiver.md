Hi

I had a similar issue only mine occurred after pairing then changing some settings on the esc. Then reconnected the receiver and it would not pair.

I disconnected everything, had transmitter off. For 5 minster or so then connected it all back up then powered on the transmitter and it all worked OK after that.

Hopefully this is of help to you...

If you search "nana x binding" or "nano x issue" you will see a lot of people are having this problem. I think enertion is working on fixing this, whether it involves a recall or a simple solder fix.

I think you need to re calibrate your ESC. I have used these ESCs in a number of builds and without calibration they remain completely unresponsive.

How do you do that? @lowGuido

hold down the red button while it is off and then turn it on, it should go through a series of beeps.
the procedure is in the manual. it is states to do this every time you change the transmitter.
im fairly sure the purple light lights up when its lost its calibration. I think it should be blue normally.. i'll confirm with one of mine in a few mins.

yes, confirmed. it should light up blue when programmed correctly.

I havent used any other transmitter on my esc other than my nano x(its my first build). And the led is blue not purple.

Did you try to bend twist the wires connecting the VESC with the receiver? My Nano-x worked fine but then the binding issue appeared from nowhere. Tried everything nothing worked, however, when I touch the cable with my bare hand and bend it a little I the thing binds immediately. When it worked before and with the twist the remote does not take more than 2s to bind.

It would be interesting to see how many of the purchased Nano-x where faulty from the beginning or failed after a while and how many actually working.

Sorry bro, mine is still broken but ive contacted enertion like 3 weeks ago and ask them for a replacement which they accepted but needed evidence so i sent them a video to show that its broken and they said yes the only thing is that they were out of stock with receivers so they told me that they will be restocking by the end of February. So im still waiting until i get my replacement @Pr0dy
