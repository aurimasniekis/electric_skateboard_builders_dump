Hey guys,

When I first tried FOC I immediately fried my torqueboards vesc, so I got myself a Focbox from enertion. Been riding with it for a few months and havent had any issues so far. I'd like to keep it that way. But the FOC mode just seems soo much nicer that I can't stop thinking about it. Two questions:

1. The sensor cable on my motor ripped off a long time ago. Can I run FOC sensorless? (side question: Could I short my motor because the cable ripped off?) 

2. Is it OK to run FOC on the enertion vesc or am I likely to fry it as well?

And as always: Thanks a bunch guys

Yes and Yes.

It wouldn‚Äôt be called the FOCbox if it couldn‚Äôt handle FOC üòâ

1. Yes, and probably not, but you should probably secure the ripped leads.

2. Of course, it's the FOC box, just make sure you set it up right and do **not** apply more throttle if the motor doesn't move or acts weird, this is how people blow their VESCs.

1: I ride Foc on a focbox sensorless.
2: I have ride +- 50km with the Focbox on foc and it works fine, its very silent on low speed. The speed top is lower than BLDC but there are solutions for (gears)

```
Your motor should have a circlip (google if you're not familiar with them) on the shaft near the base. Use circlip pliers to take them off (don't widen them too much or you wont be able to put it back on, or break them). Take out any washers under the circlip. Pull and separate the rotor can from the stator and base plate, you'll need a bit of force to get it out since they're strong magnets. From there you should be able to see the sensor PCB and desolder the leads.

Well there should be no electricity flowing through the leads since they're not plugged in anyway, you should be fine, it's just not elegant.

Just don`t upgrade your focbox to the new vesc-tool fw. Then your focbox is not a focbox anymore. Hope they fix the problem soon....

I fried a VESC-X (FocBox) with maybe a mile of testing usage. Not sure what happened but one got a fault and the other didn't with same setting over split ppm. Scared of FOC now, not even because of the cost to repair or replace but the potential danger of failure during an actual ride

Well, double check everything before you go test riding. Check for possible motor wire shorts, strippings and what not. Only when you‚Äôre 100% confident go at it. Helmet is obligatory. 
I was not afraid of FOC, if you do everything right in BLDC tool (conservative parameters with some help of mathematics) and get the motors to spin and everything sounds right when triggered-it‚Äôs miles better than bldc imho.

I had my first test ride today with my dual 6355 190kV sensored with Focboxes in FOC mode over can bus. Well, that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm done searching and wondering. It‚Äôs brutally beautiful to ride, silent, pulls like a motherf****r and brakes like a sportscar. 

If somebody wants more performance from their single drive, just don‚Äôt stress the components even more with OC parameters in BLDC tool. Double the drive. It‚Äôs unbelievable.

It's called the focbox cause the vesc name got trademarked...it's a vesc-x which is a vesc 4.12 with a few upgrades. Personally I've found the ollin vesc to be most reliable and guaranteed to have upgraded components.  
I can't recall anywhere near as many incidents of them getting killed in a couple miles compared to focbox

@florensvb doing detection with the battery being used on the board?

Well, the usual such as motor and battery specs from which you calculate min and max amps. Beside the FOC motor setup those are practically the most important ones which can make an impact on performance. But as I‚Äôve learned the hard way, more performance equals more cooling. Keep them fets as low temp as possible. Air flow is crucial.

Evolve carbon gt has a text book example of efficient vesc cooling ;)

Using DIY Vesc in FOC on 10s (192kv single) and since last week two FOCboxes in FOC on my Trampa on 12s (149kv dual) without any problems whatsoever. First configured everything in bldc and then switched and configured to FOC. No special firmwares or anything.

Ok guys, just switch to FOC and went on my first ride! Never going back hahahha. Just did the 3 calculations in the Foc tab and hit apply, done. 

Oh hell yeah its soo quiet and smooth. People here in Berlin went from ‚Äúwhats this guy there a 100 metres away doing on that humming machine‚Äù to ‚Äúwohow what just passed me?!‚Äù :D 

Few questions:

1. What can i do about the start up stutter?
2. The brakes are also smooth, except for when i get pretty slow, then it just hits the brakes to dead stop.
3. Can i try full throttle now without blowing the thing up? haha

Cheers guys

I felt the same way when I tried foc the first time. It's so awesome. If your motors are sensored then you can set that up on the vesc-x too. It will start smoothly then. I just did this. You need the proper cable to attach the motor sensor to the vesc. I'm running sensored foc on both of my boards now.


Edit* thought I read something about this and I'm sorry to hear that. It would be prudent to make sure none of those tiny wires are touching each other. There are people who say they have good start up without sensored by tweaking their vesc's.

Alright, jamming the brakes at low speed is a thing of the past! Though i am not too too happy yet because now the brakes at mid speed seem to have gotten a little too weak and i dont wanna increase my battery regen because its already at 2C. Will tweak around more with the values i guess :) 

One question though: If i tweak around with those values- will i have to repeat the foc detection process every time, or are those independent of each other?

Also: Is there a way to limit the max erpm in foc?

My motors stuttered at high RPM on f/w 2.xx. Also, when I was on the bench at max duty and applied more throttle it changed the pitch of the motor to a lower tone. I think these things would potentially blow my VESC if I used it that way.

With 3.xx both these issues were non existent.

@joeadams101 No you need to redo detection

```
I'd say the majority of the way people kill their VESCs is applying too much throttle when things aren't moving or aren't moving correctly. If you set it up and apply a little bit of throttle and it doesn't move, **do not** slam the throttle forward and back like 99% of the videos people post on here. Applying full throttle == applying max current you set. 60A-ish current on a non moving system is an easy way to blow your VESC.

My first issue was cut out during acceleration, then it was cogging, finally it all seems to be perfect and I got was what I thought was weak brakes, turns out it was because one motor/vesc wasn't working

Ok:

1. Where do I get the 3.29 firmware?

2. Can I upload the firmware from my standard bldc tool firmware tab?

3. Where do i get the bldc version for 3.29 -> Should i get the extended bldc?

vesc-project.com They don't have a compiled version for Mac, though I think someone on here might've compiled the latest release.

I just downloaded the VESC_Tool 0.82. Did I have to do something like upgrade the firmware of the FocBox before connecting?

Once you connect it'll work in limited comms mode until you flash 3.29 to the FOCbox

Yea focboxes and foc.. Big nope. A colleague from work fried (surprisingly just) one of the two focboxes in my freshly made trampa board.

Dual focbox on dual sk3 149kv on 12s. Motor max 45, motor min - 30, batt max 45, batt min - 20. Also did a proper motor detection and all the usual stuff. Very disappointed.. :(

hm sad to hear :( Ive been running it without problem so far .. Its definitely much much less likely to happen in the focbox than the torqueboards vesc (for example) but it still does happen ..

do you have the extended warranty?

Been running sensored foc here too on both my boards for quite some time. One board is 8s and one is 12s. So far no issues (knocks on wood). I usually heed the old warning of "If it isn't broke, don't fix it". Is it worth upgrading from 2.54 to the new extended bldc firmware @jinra?

I had a much better experience on vesc tool 3.xx firmware on FOC, than on 2.18/2.54

That should answer your question :)

I'm getting temps around 29C max in the mornings (7C ambient) and around 41C max in the afternoon (21C ambient) - closed but not watertight enclosure.
I'm on 10S, dual FB's with Canbus on FOC. Been driving it for about 2 weeks now, clocked around 80 kilometers so far no problems. I'm trying not to over abuse the parts...

I really hope the setup survives until the winter...it's really odd that these things fail at random. 
I'm still using stock FW. 

It's just a pity to put that much money, time and care into the build and then a 150$ part goes awry so soon. 

What boggles me sometimes is: I've basically set up a similar electronics build as found in the raptor (minus the fuse). Dual FB's, canbus, 10S 30Q , FOC. Theoretically the FB should survive the 12S but why is the raptor 2 only on 10S then? 
So yeah, they have their reasons to use the configuration that they use. And replicating that electronics config should not make things worse...in theory at least.

Hey guys,

I set up my second build today and am a little stuck on the foc configuration step.

I switched the mode to FOC, hit measure R and L. Did it, done.
Then hit Measure Lambda (Reg: R) but it says Bad Detection Results and does not give me the Lambda value.

What can i do?

Update on my one failed FocBox on dual Carvon V3 setup (split ppm all settings the same). I had mine fixed, I decided to stay on BLDC for a bit. Everything worked spectacularly, rode about 40 mile on bldc. 

Finally decided to change it to FOC right before SPD2. Test rode it for a mile or so and it worked. Next morning at SPD2 I rode it for maybe 50 yards and one drive stopped working. Opened it up and the same vesc had a fault. Luckily DRVWiard was also there and swapped it out at the end of the day. I‚Äôve gotten 30 mile on FOC now and still working (fingers crossed) I‚Äôm thinking I just a bad first batch Vesc-X?

motor short would be super surprising as its brand new. the first detection step works and the motor spins but then the second fails.

Sometimes the motor mounting screws are too long and can hit the copper and cause a short, maybe check for that?

You'd be surprised. TB's screws tend to be too long and end up shorting the motor.
