Hi everyone.
 I followed all the tutorials  to bind the controller with the reciever. I have a gt2b and a vesc from Enertion. 
When I bind from the controller, the red light of the reciever stop blinking and get solid , but when I restart it, start blinking again. Any suggestion to solve it?
Thanks!!
