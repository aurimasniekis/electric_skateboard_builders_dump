Hello. I have a problem with a very weak brake. The film shows that the brake is very weak.
I suspect that you need to set something in the software just do not know which option suits it.

Well. It is rc CAR esc so that's about it. Those are made for lightweight rc cars not for esk8.

Previously I had a fvt 120a and the brake was very strong and also it is an esc for the car

Fvt is exception in my opinion. Very few car esc has good brakes.

Did you set it up to max to test it out?

It looks like there are quite a lot brake functions actually..

What is this 'Stage brake'Ë™ ?

I set everything up to maximum and the brake is stronger but it is still too weak
Stage break

Honestly.. I dont know what else to recommend.. U can always make a different gearing for your board - for more power for example, Ive heard this also helps but im not 100% sure..

On a side note - sometimes it is better to have weaker brake, than a too strong one ;) :D

can you make a video how you test the brake and how good or bad it is now?

Compared to the fvt, the brake is very weak. I regret that I bought such shit ..

you can tune the brakes on that ESC very strong! I have used that ESC and had it braking so hard it stops the board dead and you street your face!
you just need to change the settings with the program card.

have you changed the brake rate switch point setting???

I think maybe your brake rate switch point is wrong and you are only getting 1 stage brake 10%

The brake is still very weak:/
Esc calibrated according to instructions. First neutral position then full throttle then full brake

Do u know how that break rate switch point works?

I now understand there might be 2 brake levels. I get similar feeling with fvt but settings there are not as custom as here actually.

how are you actually testing the brake? are you riding it? or just testing on the bench?

@lowGuido  This was also my question I had.. thats why i wanted that he films how he tests the braking..
As it is unclear how he concludes brake is too weak..

Maybe he need to set initial break higher, 60% but then it might as well be too sudden already..

I dont think I have had the brakes set more than 40% on that ESC its strong enough..

Previously I tested the ride. Now I check on the bench, as I can without a problem with one hand move the engine on full brake I know the brake is too weak

I dont know if u have experience with fvt 6s but I need to set them to about 60%, 40% is too weak but it still brakes.

never used FVT. im talking about trackstar. for what its worth I dont like the trackstar for a few reasons and the complicated braking program is one of them.

you really need to ride them to test them properly. because the brakes will work harder at high speed than they do at low resistance.. its the nature of regen brakes.

That's messed up!.. What happens if you set initial brake to 100%? That is what I would have done to test it whenever it works at all.. otherwise let @lowGuido help u as he has dealt with this kind of esc before.

So brake strenght 100%, initial break 100%.. not sure about stage brake, If u dont get it working maybe copy some info on what each setting actually means.. Otherwise maybe controller is just acting up, @lowGuido said it might not be easy to set it up right, I think..

yeah something seems wrong. even default settings on those should be quite strong brake. do the transmitter calibration again just in case its the trigger on the transmitter.

okay. I changed the settings and the board brakes. Does not brake as hard as fvt but brakes. It only annoys me, the beginning of braking is very loud, can it be fixed or is it normal?

the loud is normal and can't be changed.  thats was one of the other reasons I dont like that ESC.

so what settings did you get to work for you?

those settings still dont look right to me. 

I dont think the switch point should be 99. but if its working for you then whatever...

I dont recomend those ESCs. I got some for science early on and didnt like them.
