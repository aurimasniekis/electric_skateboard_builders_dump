Hello, I Bought a Ebay BMS that the Overcharge Protection is 4.3v, but normally the Charge of a cell is 4.2v, how do I change it? And I use a 25.2v Smart Charger, Would It correct my problem?

4.3V is not that bad, you can't change the limit manually

But how? And 4.3V Decreases the cycles I can have with my battery

25.2 / 6 = 4.2. So you should be safe. 

But one of my China bought charging bricks had a higher voltage than what the specs showed, so make sure to measure it before you use it.

I'll look at my first charge if it pass 4.2v, if it go over I will do something to cut when it reaches 25.2v
