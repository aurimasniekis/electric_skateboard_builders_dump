Hello I drew a diagram please help me out and verify that it's going to work. I'm planning to have a 12s4p battery and have the discharging bypass the bms. Also if somebody have a bms they have in mind that I can you please tell me, not too expensive one thought. It dosen't have to have a high amp rating because I'm bypassing it, thank you.

Make sure your volt meter is after your xt 90  antispark, otherwise it will always be on.

Voltmeter location's seems fine. Current will only flow in it when xt90-s is plugged in his diagram, @Sender No ?

Nope xt90 cuts only one wire so it will be always on.

```
b- is negative from battery, p- is negative going from the bms to the charge port
