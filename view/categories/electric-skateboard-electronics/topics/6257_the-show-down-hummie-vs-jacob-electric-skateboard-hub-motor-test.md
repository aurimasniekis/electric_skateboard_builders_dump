1. Only 22mph with 10S? 
2. How much speed did the Jacobs reach?

Jacobs should reach 24mph, but in reality it's more like about 20mph.... It was hard to get that data since the vibrations of the Jacob hub wheel due to slipping urethane got really bad at higher speeds.

Does the current iteration of Jacob's motors have any sort of teeth for the urethane or is it all held by friction? I know Hummie's urethan is ribbed so it moves with the can better.

yes, they have four teeth on the motor barrel... Jacob tells me the urethane is also improved version now. Slight increase in hardness & better quality.

nice video, lots of effort! the end felt a little rushed though, I actually had to pause the video to read the topspeed conclusions .. :smile:

wouldve been really REALLY great with vesc overlays to compare currents/power, maybe to have it black on white why hummies (hubbies haha!) are running hotter?

did you do all the tests with the same battery btw? what was the voltage when you did the topspeed runs? especially the hill climbing comparison feels a little problematic because of the discharge curves of liion batteries. they drop extremely fast from 42 -> 40, so whoever starts first probably has a 1-2V advantage until these cells get into this very linear slow steady decrease of voltage. I dont doubt that jacobs climb better because its simply larger motors, but ontop of that there might be also a 1-2V difference here which is quite noticeable in topspeed measurements at least ... probably doesnt really matter much for this hill climbing.

Nice work on the video.  I like your objective tests!  

Was kind of surprised these hubs are only maxing out of 20-22 mph on 10s??  Though it would be much higher.

It is the weight!

@lowguido 69kg / 12S / 30mph
@onloop    95kg / 10S / 22mph (12S /  26,4mph)

A difference of 25kg results in a loss of about 4mph. That sounds reasonable!

And we should not forget that @onloop has an early batch with soft urethane and @lowGuido had the newer ones. The difference in the material could be factor.

I managed to get up to 26mph / 42kph using Hummie Hubs on 10S and i weigh 90kg too.
This is also the early aluminium bluegoo version and using soft / slowcure urethane Hummie used back then. Still holding up fine, but the motors get hot when going fast for longer periods at a time or going up long hills. So i'm also curious about the steel versions...

Did these hummie motors also have the blue goo on them? I think he got rid if the blue goo and solved the overheating issue by decreasing the air gap and changing to steel.

Honestly if you just want people to tell you Hummie's are faster, we can all do that. This comparison was valuable, but it would be better if we had most recent designs of both motors.

It really bugs me that all this "science and tests" you're doing are just for your own little ego trip that Hummie's are better. Honestly Hummie's should be faster, they have a higher kV! The fact that you seem so bent on having to prove that it's true just shows how inefficient Hummie's motors are. If they didn't waste so much energy in heat, there would be no doubt in anyone's mind that they are faster.

Please stop cluttering up every single thread you come across with your tests, and stick to the "Top Speed" one you already created.

So when setting up with VESC is there anything you need to do special with these or is it just the usual motor detection etc?

this whole comparison is sort of flawed to begin with ... of course will jacobs motors have more torque cause they are bigger and of course will hummies be faster cause of the KV value. :smile:

the most interesting thing are the side effects that happened:
* insane heat in hubbies
* slipping wheels on acceleration of jacubs

Hi.  It's been mislabeled many times these are not 83mm wheels but 80mm made with 4725 stators.  Much smaller than Jacobs. More rubber as well.   The test is also using the experimental blue goo motors which have shown to be worse at holding heat as the windings are sealed in epoxy. 

The steel I'll be testing the temps of today and they so far have shown much cooler and that could be due to a small airgap or simply the steel not transferring the heat as well as aluminum.  We will see on an extended ride, short rides they show way cooler.  You'll see.  Ive been slow to test as I had  escs break 3 times in two days but fixed now and the test will happen today (always the canbus connection breaks)

These tests were almost all about heat and heat is important.   These motors are not magic and smaller motors have more electrical limitations than large.  They will get hotter. Next batch it'll be a 4727 stator and defiantly more copper and that can help but my goal in making these is to make something that won't break mechanically.    That's another test which I think is more important.   ive said it many times...slide fitted aluminum motors is a sure way to have a rattling motor that will rattle its way to the garbage.

[/quote]

It's worth noting that currently **STARY BOARD** has exactly the same problem with slipping urethane when accelerating. The only one that got the HUB MOTOR urethane right is INBOARD. They have a special TPU CORE inside the urethane. It gives extra grip for the wheel, and urethane doesn't bend and wobble.

so the truth is that not only motor's itself are important but urethane as well/.

Sorry i got your specs wrong, in my defense it's very hard to find the true info about your product. the KV is not even listed on your website.

Despite what some folks will try to tell you, Smaller motors will never be as good as bigger ones. They will heat up faster & have less torque.

The speed at which you can travel does not determine the quality of a motor.... You could make these motors go even faster by increasing the KV, but the heat will just keep rising.

if you can somehow make a hub motor that goes high speed, climbs hills rapidly & has low heat you are on a winner!

His steel hubs seem to have far less heat problems. Running at 10s, my aluminum hubs went to 210 F while hummies steels got to 137 F. He is much lighter than me, and was running higher amp limits and at 12s instead of 10s, but it seems much cooler, even factoring in the difference.

I've decided to do a 4wd with 4 Chaka VESCs and 4 of hummies steel motors. Hummies been helping me press the deck in making for it, and it'll have a 16000 mAh. The goals: 15+ miles with steep hill climbing abilities.

Huston Huston we have a problem ! Seems like not only the old version of Jacobs hubs has wobbly urethane. The new ones have this issue as well :frowning:  

[quote="Titoxd10001, post:249, topic:4762"]
The hub motors have nice torque but after 3 days of testing they're basically unusable the urethane slips like no tomorrow and the vibrations are so nasty when that happens. I want to like them so bad but it's just a bad design. The little "teeth" can't handle the torque especially with the "soft" urethane.

Yeah I think hummie motors win by default because Jacobs are unusable at this point. When the urethane was brand new and stayed in place I was quite surprised with the torque. If until this issue can be fixed hummie is the winner in my books even though I don't own his motors.

The flaw in hummies motors is the smaller stator, if you want to call it a flaw. This is why I think a 4wd of hummies would be the best configuration. Lower tempetures, which are really my only issue. I'm back to riding the aluminum version daily again for the last 2 weeks. They are great hubs, except for the heat.

@onloop I'm not looking for trouble, but the way that end was edited and the omission of Jacobs track test, along with the main focus being on the temperature of the motors, seemed like you were trying to railroad his motors, instead of doing an unbiased, fair test. The whole tone of the test seems to point out the flaws of hummies, ignoring the flaws of Jacobs, pointing the good things out about Jacobs, and ignoring the good things about hummies. No real talk about the rubber slippy on Jacobs. No tests to compare the slipping of the rubber on hummies (which doesn't slip) versus the slipping of Jacobs, which seems to be very quick. Again, not looking for trouble, but I can't stand by and watch this without voicing my opinion. I could effectively do the same kind of edit to make Jacobs look bad and hummies to be great, but that's not right. The point should be to compare all goods and bads of both, not the goods on one and the bads on the other. Rubber issues could be design issues, not just your mixture of polyurethane. So it is an imporatnt issue. Everyone saw what happened to Mischo Erban at 60 mph when the cores come off. Not everyone's riding around in leather suits with full head helmets either, so you do want to know your wheels will stay on the motors and do their job.

didnt have a feeling that it was overly biased - jason said that he had grip issues with jacobs and you could see it in the acceleration test clearly that hummies, despite smaller motor, were just as fast because they didnt have that problem.

it really felt like the end was kinda rushed though ... as if someone suddenly had no time anymore cause a baby was born. :smile:

what I overall never understood is that weird focus of really EVERYBODY on the motor stats when they talk about hubs. whats way more important to me has always been the urethane, how the hubs feel, the comfort it provides, the grip they have for carving. I dont care at all if a hub can bring me up to carving speed in 3, 5 or 20 seconds - I just want a great feeling wheel.

when "back emf" voltage and "input" voltage are equal (at no load rpm) that is what sets the "speed limit" of any particular motor based on it's KV.
[/quote]

you didnt know that? :open_mouth:

basically its self induction & lenz's law - electrons are moving in the field of the permanent magnets which accelerates them, following lenz's law, against the flow of the outer current from the esc. back emf feels like a really weird term for that basic principle. to put it super bluntly: a motor is always also a generator and the generator produces a current that works against the ESC current until it cancels out.

YES it was rushed a little bit, but also the video is very long for youtube, 17mins is long! I had filmed a whole section of me talking about the experience but never included that because it was just too much content. 10 mins should be the target.

**Hummies are faster over long distance, really no need to show the slower one doing the same lap but slower.**

[quote="whitepony, post:58, topic:6257"]

[/quote]

I think it is logical to focus on engineering & performance first, once the design is solid & performs well in the environments we like to ride i think then the focus will shift to the other things such as comfort. Adding more urethane to a hub motor will make it more comfortable but it will also mean smaller stator which means more heat.

[/quote]

Temperature was my main focus, high temperature kills motors, destroys magnets, melts insulation & burns vescs, it needs to be minimised. It also burns skin! 

Also, pretty much the shitiest motor you could find will work on flats, top speed on flats is not a test of anything. The most important data is hill climbing speeds, starting torque & temperatures. 

Technically speaking the problem with jacobs urethane slipping would mean the data from top speed lap would have to be omitted anyway. There is no easy way to ride at top speed on a set of hub motors that are vibrating and bouncing up & down. It just would not be reliable data so it was omitted. Even if jacobs hubs were rolling smoothly they still would not beat the Hummie Hubs on the flats. Electrically speaking they cannot win that race so it is a pointless exercise.

If i was trying to be biased i could have just omitted that info about the hummies being faster & not mentioned the problem with the jacob urethane.

It's true you did mention hummies were faster, and Jacobs had the urethane problem. I wished you talked more about the slipping. I'm still not visually sure how they are slipping (side to side or on the circumference of the motor). I didn't see any video showing the slipping (except while riding, which was too far away to really see how they are slipping), or the results of the inside of the urethane after slipping. it was a lot of talk and showing of heat being an issue in hummies, with just brief mentions here and there that the urethane was slipping on Jacobs. You did many things right in that test. I personally would have redone the hill climb speed test. The one you got going on hummies had a really slow start, which was what killed his time. If you came at the hill with momentum, which you likely will in most real world situations, the climb would have been much faster, and they wouldn't have been quite so hot, and you would have a more realistic test. I've been doing many hill tests using the space cell modded to 25 amps per motor and measuring heat. To get from my house to hummies the other day, I got them up to 240 F not once, but five times. Had to take breaks and took twice as long as it should of. I haven't tried the steels on this route yet, but I'm expecting much less heat biased on the tests we did last week. This route btw is uphill straight for 2 miles at around 5% grade, followed by 1 mile down, followed by 2 miles of either flat or slight uphill.

So long story short, heat is a problem with hummies aluminum. It won't be an issue for those who don't have a lot of hills. The steel seem to run much cooler, and this issue seems to have been solved. Its funny how fast the industry is changing right now. Before you could edit and release this, both claim to have fixed their problems, thus meaning a re comparison needs to be done :P

From what hummie told me, it should be around 300 F.

The steel should not get above 220 F. Even when I get them over 250 F, they cool down and return to normal operation in time (for now at least).

Again, this is why I'm opting for a 4wd setup on the steel. I think the industry will eventually move in this direction more when prices for parts drop more then they are right now.

I'm wondering how steel motors are cooler than aluminium ones? I thought aluminium has much better thermal conductivity. So where are you measuring the temperature? If on the steel, you would be measuring that the heat is not dissipated to the outside but still inside the motor...

As an owner of a set of hummie hubs I would say this is not really necessary. 
There is no slippage between rotor and urethane. Changing the urethane is a matter of loosening 6 bolts per wheel that hold the retaining disk and slipping of the urethane.

[quote="onloop, post:64, topic:6257"]
Temperature was my main focus, high temperature kills motors, destroys magnets, melts insulation & burns vescs, it needs to be minimised. It also burns skin! 

Also, pretty much the shitiest motor you could find will work on flats, top speed on flats is not a test of anything. The most important data is hill climbing speeds, starting torque & temperatures.
[/quote]

all this technical data is one way of looking at this and it's interesting to measure and compare all of this data. 
But in the end, does it really matter if one motor get's you a couple of seconds faster up the hill or has 2km/h more top speed or get's some degrees hotter than the other? 

[quote="onloop, post:64, topic:6257"]

Now this is the most important fact comparing those motors! I suppose most people don't want motors that bounce up and down, no matter how fast they go. 


[quote="whitepony, post:58, topic:6257"]
what I overall never understood is that weird focus of really EVERYBODY on the motor stats when they talk about hubs. whats way more important to me has always been the urethane, how the hubs feel, the comfort it provides, the grip they have for carving. I dont care at all if a hub can bring me up to carving speed in 3, 5 or 20 seconds - I just want a great feeling wheel.
[/quote]

Fully in line with whitepony here! 
How does a specific setup feel, how much fun do I get out of it, is it balanced, does it work, is it good for carving, speeding, going up the hills  ... 

Not picking on those who made the test / video, fully appreciate that it takes a hell lot of a time to do those. Please include some of the "soft factors" as well. 

Maybe you can give us still a quick summary of how the different hubs feel under your feet.

Yes, I believe it does. Maybe the reasons are not obvious to the end user as to why i focus on this stuff.... 

However, anyone who sells a product or is looking to run a business should always have a strong focus on longevity & reliability. If a product fails early in its life you will eventually be sent broke due to warranty claims. I learned this lesson when i was selling 50mm outrunners, too many people abused them & they eventually failed. So i believe over engineering & designing for longevity should be a primary objective for all vendors. In my opinion heat is a longevity problem. It's also inefficient, it means the energy in your battery is not being used for propulsion.

```
the magnets are rated to 300f.  N45sh.  

making something reliable that will last is why I made these.   the mechanical design of these is stouter than anything I've seen and now I make them in all steel.

these motors I'm selling are not everyone's answer to every question.   theyre small and are limited in that regard.  Sure you can get a bigger motor and theyre out there but my goal is to keep adding power and ability to THIS size solely and that's very possible.  ultimately that will mean less heat.  I could get a giant motor made but it doesnt appeal to me.

for me the only problem with these motors is the softer rubber and I'm sending people a set of both hard and soft because while the soft stuff rides great I need to figure a core out or some fabric support at the core.    I can ride these all day around san francisco and not have to stop for heat.  Like i said they arent for everyone but definately are enough for me.  In the future they will have a bit longer stator and more copper and be a bit cooler but that's the extent of making these more powerful for now.



But onloop what of maytech telling me you will be selling motors "exactly" like mine except bigger?!  Id be nice to hear an answer from you.  I'll be bummed to find you're throwing me under the bus so that you can then make an infomercial why your version of my design is better.    Maybe I'm wrong but you dont respond.

Reading this thread saddens me.
I run an escape-the-room business in Ukraine. And I remember when everything was just starting two years ago: small groups of people were making what was really basic level, but everyone treated the scene as "there's no competition" (because every room has a uniqe script and setting). Now, when customers judge everyone by the amount of electronics, size of rooms, location and other features that shouldn't be judged by themselves (forgetting about art, story/plot and logic), owners employ more marketing tricks, show each other in a bad light and steal parts of other's rooms, the atmosphere that was fun really became "just business". I suppose where there's money, there's war. And to survive, you need to be sly and tough. Not to be pessimistic though, we all need to feed our families.

So the moral of the story is - only commit to the business you really enjoy running, so that you have the energy to fight.

I made this video for the benefit of the community. Jacob and hummie have had some lengthy threads talking about specs and design differerences & people have asked for side by side comparison, @lowGuido made a video talking about design and performance. But he didn't have Hill climbing or temperature readings which I feel is critical information when comparing motors. Is was a coincidence that I happened to have both products at hand in my garage so I decided to make a video. 

I hope now the community can make a more educated decision.

Neither product is my design, I make zero revenues from the sale of these products. Hopefully the designers can learn from my findings and improve their offering.

It's a cool process to see in action. It all makes a lot of sense.

The 3D printed wheel, the homemade molds that looks super legit, and work really well at shaping the wheels.

I am been able to make hummies rubber slip side to side, even the 90 duro rubber. It could be linked to high heat in the motors. I nomally ride at 170-230 F. I have around 50 miles so far on them, and hummie ran them a bunch before I got them. When I remove the wheel, there's a slight bit of dust from the ribs of the wheel.

The problem is simply the wheel can go side to side, past the outer ring plate holding it in on the wheel. It's a super tight fit, so it doesn't really fly off. It doesn't result in any losses of control what's so ever. Funny enough, I only noticed it because hummie checked it to see if how the rubber was holding up.

I'm having hummie attach some to trucks for me to try some time in the next few days. And will see if I can cook the steels up or not. So far, I do like them, but the heat means they are better for a short distance, jumpy board. It has a good amount of torque, and in FOC, all I hear is the rubber rolling on the street. It's a true sound of Beauty.

If the steels don't get too hot, the rubbers will likely be fine. If the got hot in dual, I'll go quad and see how hot they get.

I like the smaller motors in a space sense. Putting cost aside, 4 hubs, compacted into the wheel with no hangovers, seems like it should have the best torque and traction. Part of the key of gliding up hills is momentum. And I feel like 4wd will do that the best.

My only issue and the reason i' not using my carvons right now is the lack of torque. I can't climb hills with them like hummies. And thats cause the kv is too high.

If you can solder, just change that yourself. I have done that on my single hub, massive torque now.

Both^^ motor open up, sanded the enamel coating off strand by strand, and soldered back together like i want them to be:

I haven't seen it done but wonder if u could open up not the motor but just the 3 motor leads and if they're the same as the tacon 160 and the motor's enameled wires go the whole length of the lead then u could go strand by strand through those wires with a battery and led and reterminate them that way.   You wouldn't have to open the motor and try to rip apart and find..which is a nightmare in my experience.

There's maybe only 15 strands per lead.  I tied to reterminate a tacon160 by opening it and there was so much glue and confusion in there..after failing I then thought I'd rewind and I couldn't even get the wire off the stator. It sits in my cabinet.  I bet you could reterminate a tacon 160 with just the leads quickly and if jerrys motors also have the enameled wire come all the way out itd be as easy.

Sure you could also do it outside the motor. In my case (turnigy sk3 6374 - same as Jerry's), there was no glue (besides the enamel coating) in the motor.

@LEVer so what's the torque gonna be like with 116Kv setup ? enough to climb hills in FOC with 12s3p ?
and as to wheels..if it's non machined than I assume you are using this steel pulley that you posted on Instagram right ? Would there be an option to use 83mm wheels of my choice instead of 90mm ?? The diameter of the pulley should be the same right ? ...I rekon that with 83mm that I like to ride I could get even more torque due to the smaller wheel size.

Okay, questionable theory time!

I recently saw the thread about LowGuido's two different motor kV setup and how well that worked for him, and I was thinking about what that could mean for hub motors!

If we have one low kV motor for low-end torque, and a higher kV motor for top-end speed, we could have a winning combination! Now granted it wouldn't be near as good as just two low kV or two high, but if we hit well enough in the middle, the compromise might be worth it.

This could work if you could somehow disengage the throttle from the motor with lower kv once it reaches its max rpm. A motor will spin with very little resistance past its max rpm as long as no throttle is applied.

I'm still new to this but already I've  found a massive difference between more thane vs less in terms of ride quality and enjoyment. I love carving so wheel reliability and consistency is also important. I also find torque is more valuable than higher speeds, as is hill climb reliability and firm braking force. This keeps bringing me back to a belt design (the downsides are less important than the requirements above). I kinda feel the in-hub design is inherently weaker (if you want prefer the things above). It sounds cool in concept and looks sweet, but in terms of scientific limitations, it's all a trade off. If I went hubs, it would be to meet a different purpose.  I would only be interested in low profile, quite, flat-ish, smooth surface applications, - and I'd accept the limitations then because my primary needs would be met (and better off-throttle rolling would be a bonus). I can't see how ALL the requirements above could be met or mostly met unless (perhaps) you took the @LEVer  approach (esp the Evo concept), mostly because the importance of thane is a limiting factor in the hub design philosophy. Adding in-hub gearing like stary adds noise back, still has less thane, and I imagine removes the sweet free-rolling of characteristics of other hub designs.

I'm not sure if any of you might be interested but I've been rolling the Jacobs for almost a year now with many different iterations and mods to make the wheel not slip. 

I finally did a design that is composed of a solid polycarbonate inner core and 80a urethane around it. Right now I bumped theme little wider by a total of 10mm more and diameter increase to 86mm. Several of the members have offered insight like hummie on the materials and process to make them. Right now it's proof of concept but hopefully some US manufacture can produce them for everyone interested.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/9/49b1f3aa692e5d393fd18812a093a4400d135cee.jpg" width="281" height="500">

Maybe you can put the still liquid rubber with the mold after vacuuming into a pressure pot to get better results. (i know this post is old but can't hold me back)
For this technique you have to fill the pressure pot with warm water which covers the whole rubber and then get airpressure on that, which you have to hold on for about a few minutes until the rubber is hardened. This could cause a much more homogenized rubber result.

I’ve done that but never felt need to fill pressure pot w water. It works at making sonething flawless but I think if ur doing it very carefully I can get just as good results, depending how thick it is.  I bet u could get flawless results even without a vacuum If u stir right.  

So far in my experience the whole “pour a long steady stream” to supposedly crush bubbles out doesn’t work n better the shortest pour.  

But I dont pour n hope to not pour a tire again. 

Lately been disgusted on “setting” plastic and polyurethane and instead really excited about all the remoldable recyclables that are common with the triangles.  It seems strangely a new frontier and there aren’t any good YouTube videos. People will press it into a block or round and then I guess cut it down on a lathe or mill. It’s so thick it’s far from pourable. More like gum. Needs be pressed in either an aluminum mold or I’m hoping with enough ash filler in the hardest silicone can find (60a) will be good enough.  But getting an aluminum mold made could get it cut somewhere, haven’t looked at cost yet.  Could cast aluminum in a silicone mold to be super diy.  

I like the #2 plastic but have read of furniture being made using all the recyclables together. Surpsing as they have different melt temps.  I’ll be seeing.  Pretty damn easy to throw some plastic in an old toaster.  Silicone n ash in the mail. Will be making an enclosure.

Not sure if i understand all of what you re saying, but i can tell you first, that the water is a very important thing by hardening plastics or gum or whatever in a pressure pot, because this will eliminate all micro bubbles in the material you can't see with the eye, but if you can handle your results without water until now, i will never have said anything:wink:
...An aluminium mold is a good idea, but not easy to build. If you are searching for good silicones to duplicate something, it would be good to use silicones from dental technicans, because they are very,very precise and easy to handle...to strengthen this silicone you need to add a simple ring or something which is bigger then your workpiece,from aluminum, steel or even plastic, around your workpiece before pouring the silicone into your box you use for duplicating (i hope you understand what i mean).
So that ring will stay in the silicone after hardening and gives it very much stability and the result is much more precise because there is less silicone wrapping your workpiece...like i mentioned before some dental techniques could be a good solution
