Wondering if anyone has an suggestions no battery builders that are available to us here is canada.
This is the only remaining part and I dont really have too much time to build it myself.
I have talked to longhaired and he mentioned he wont have the best price so hoping for something reasonable.

Good point Ovi, I am in Brampton and commute to Toronto weekly

Unless you have volume, it's not worth it for our suppliers to do one-offs. Your best bet is to get a battery made by someone on the forum. You won't get cheaper than here. And if you did, I'd be scared of the quality and probably wouldn't risk even riding the board... A well made battery is of crucial importance. One fire is enough for legislation to ban esk8 altogether. Don't cheap out on the batterypack.

Not sure, poke around in the posts, the battery builders are pretty vocal around here, you'll find out easily who makes some. @barajabali is one

@pkasanda I donâ€™t know Canada geography but are you near Toronto? Asking because you have a US mailing address and might be of assistance in this US to Canada battery shipping issue

I'm located in Edmonton AB and in the process here of building some batteries for 2 for myself and 1 for a guy I met on reddit lol.


I'm not quite up and running still waiting on nickel heatshrink and tape I ordered back in March :( but we should be able to work something out that'd probably be cheaper than importing an entire pack from the US, however it would most likel y take a bit longer as well.

I built a spot welder with bits from Canadian tire and a 12v car battery. Cost me like $40 if you already have  the battery. Seems to have done an ok job...![IMG_20180629_094155|375x500](upload://hKJM430PJZ06nKUhu8qrCqp4S6x.jpg)

Looks good to me! Any shots of the welder itself?

Maybe we can arrange a battery group buy?

I don't have it set up atm but I'll get one when I use it again. It is pretty simple however. If you have the electrical knowledge to build an Esk8 battery you'll be able to figure out how to set up a 12v relay with a momentary switch (I used an automotive horn button). Good luck :slight_smile:
