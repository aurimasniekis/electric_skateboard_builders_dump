My build is similar to to yours.  I only use the anti spark switch as an on off switch.

Take the Plus wire after the series connection and connect it to the 2 Pluses on the focbox's. Same goes for the Minus.
Antispark can be used as an on/off switch. You can put it between the series connection and the focbox's. 
If you still want to put an on/off switch you can put it between the antispark and the focbox's.

That is prob exactly how I am going to connect mine here is some pics of my deck up close from hi5ber this one is called zenith I got the optional reinforcement for heavyweight riders I think it means they add more layers of carbon fiber not sure some of the finish quality is not what I thought it would be for a hand made to order product maybe I'm just being to picky either way I still like it![20180327_183457|281x500](upload://k6kgfLZ5FqykUBDjmD3PfPa9RER.jpg)![20180327_183523|690x388](upload://vvZzbWmvylJLdKSLX2kc4rXUuKZ.jpg)![20180327_183543|690x388](upload://nYjIzhKrBh1xBUD5fvfd7E1scw5.jpg)![20180327_183626_001|690x388](upload://buT2VnX4In8jKhHqB20SU40EYP1.jpg)

Why not just throw in a bms so you can charge it with a laptop charger? That way you can also just make one big 12s5p pack instead of having two packs to worry about.

also, for the two focboxes, wire them in parallel. That means use this:![download (4)|225x225](upload://4NImkThO1gMl5baJmBoeDhH8idz.jpeg)
