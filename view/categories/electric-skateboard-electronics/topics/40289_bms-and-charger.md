Hi everyone
I'm loving the forum and the community everyone is so helpful 
I've just finished ordering all the parts for my first E-board and I have a question about BMS 
my config is:
C6374 brushless motor 170KV
https://www.ebay.com/itm/single-motor-electric-longboard-skateboard-controller-ESC-Substitute/322688416729?hash=item4b21ba7bd9:m:mGesvI1BOEcyvrLVbfKGQ8Q - this is my ESC (budget oriented build)
2x 3S 11.1V 5000mAh in series = 6s battery
and this BMS
https://www.ebay.com/itm/6S-22-2V-Li-ion-18650-Lithium-Battery-Packs-BMS-Protection-PCB-Board-w-Balance/192307924973?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649

I have a charger that can output 19v 4.75a, can I use it to charge my pack?

thank you very much

You need a 25.2V charger, search for "25.2V Li-ion charger" on aliexpress, they are cheap....
