```
I am building my electric longboard and i have two 6s4p batteries that are connected with a harness in **series** making it  a 12s4p.  The batteries with the harness are going to be connected into a antispark on/off switch and this one will be connected to two focboxes. My question is. Sould i connect the batteries and on/off switch to the focboxes with another series connector or should i use a parallel connector?

I hope my question make sense.  

Also i apologize for my English.

```
the controler always parallel to each other, so you need to connect them with a parallel plug to the battery (or the anti spark switch in your case)
