I know there are a lot of other posts like this, but I couldn’t quite find the answer I was looking for. I have an iPhone SE, and I set up the module like the tutorial says, but the Xmatic app keeps saying connecting to Vesc... When I look in my phones Bluetooth connections, it says it’s connected to the module, HM SOFT. Any thoughts?

I believe that the module was shipped with the wires in reverse order, so I in plugged the connector and flipped it![image|375x500](upload://falZeKub8Xu9AJCNPX8AuBx2WQj.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://baXNWaHOAXMhYXNqTfuHEWGe1h3.jpeg)
