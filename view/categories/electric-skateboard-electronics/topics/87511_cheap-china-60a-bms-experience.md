I´m reading a lot in the forum and learned already a lot, it´s awesome, thanks for all the tech talk. 

But I´m still unsure about the BMS. Many people are speaking about charge only BMS, but others always recommend a good discharge one. Will the BMS have a negative influence on power, like torque and rpm of the motor? 

There are 60A BMS for around 20€, has anyone ever tried on of these for charge and discharge? 60A continuous should be enough for a single drive, right?

E.g. https://www.ebay.de/itm/10S-BMS-Schutzbrett-mit-Balance-Hohe-Qualität-Siegel-36V-16A-25A-35A-45A-60A/263586101128?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=562639289165&_trksid=p2060353.m1438.l2649

or

If these are rubbish, the only option is the Bestech ones. For charge only http://litechpower.com/product-detail/HCX-D190LI10S.html with a cheap anti spark loop key.

or going full in with http://litechpower.com/product-detail/HCX-D596LI10S.html and have the electric switch included. Does the electric switch shut down the board completly or does I have to install another switch (loop key) to disconnect the batteries from the BMS completly to avoid discharging on long storage periods? I really hate the huge size of the BMS.

I would be happy about your thoughts and experience, specially about the cheap BMS options. Thanks in advance.

Probably 60a burst/max

You can count more on 35-40 amps continuous.

I have cheapo bms 40 amps and it works fine. I guess it’s hit or miss...

A few people use them and I didn't read any negative (someone correct me if I'm wrong). I would like to buy it, too but unfortunately it's not available in 12s. A friend of mine bought it and was cursing because it has JST-PH (2mm pitch) balance cables and he bought wrong JST-XH replacement cables.

The BMS shuts down above 180A, you can't hit this limit :smile:.

I use cheap and expensive BMS both without troubles. On my MTB I use 50A Bestech BMS and draw up to 100A battery amps. The over current protection would start at 120A so no worries.

IMO the important point of BMS in general is the value of over current protection. Supower for example, their 60A "continious" BMS has 60A over current protection :thinking:, I would call it 30A continious. My cheap 60A BMS has 120A over current protection. It can handle the 60A continious and more for short periods.

How does it work with the e-switch? Does the electric switch shut down the board completely or do I have to install another switch (loop key) to disconnect the batteries from the BMS completely to avoid discharging on long storage periods?

I have one of these 60amp bms but have not used it yet.    I am also interested in hearing others experience on this.
