**Wireless VESC setup**
You can also change VESC setup across the app (min/max current for battery/motor, eRPM and watt limit for ackmaniac watt mode).

 **More to come**
I'm already working on new features:
- battery limit sound alarm, 
- configuration profiles, 

Next version will arrive very soon.
And I'm widely open to all suggestion about new features.
 
**OpenSource / pay version ?**
I plan to opensource the application.
At this moment, Apple policy make me to pay 99€ to share the application with you across the app store. I have been thinking about donation, but I've decided to put a very small price on this app (around 4$), to make the cost of this app negligible for you and for me.I'll keep your informed on this point.
 
**Bluetooth Connection**
We've been using this app all the summer, and it's working great.
I'm using HM-10 bluetooth module, but it should work with others similar module.
If you have trouble connecting the app to your VESC there is a "send debug infos" button to send me needed data to help you.

The application is compatible with standard VESC firmware (2.18), new VESC firmware (3.27, 3.28, 3.29 and 3.30)  and ackmaniac firmware (2.53, 2.54 and 3.100).

I just bought and installed it, and it connected instantly via bluetooth. If you could make it as comprehensive as the almanac version, that'd be awesome! I really like the fact that you can video record your rides, and the battery % and mile logging is great as well. I have a $30 android phone that I've been using, but don't enjoy taking 2 phones with me on skate trips.
Thanks for the work on this app!

I've add some precision about that in the original post.

Hi @emmaanuel !
Good to hear from you here ! :smile:
 
I've been beta tester across the development of the app and one thing I need to tell you is that Emanuel is a very nice guy who take any suggestions and remark very seriously and implement it immediately.
Love the way to work with.

I'm also a defender of Open Source projects and we talked about that with him.
But Apple policy really sucks and it's a big cost to support alone if the app is offered for free.
Hope he can manage soon or later to switch it to the wonderful OS world.
That being said (and known), paying $4 is not a big deal. ;)

Can't wait for the future releases ! :slight_smile:

This is great! The biggest benefit in my opinion is the ability to change VESC settings from your phone. You have no idea how many times I've had friends want to try my board and then almost get thrown off and complain it's too aggressive. The configuration profiles will allow a quick change to beginner mode, so people won't kill themselves when trying out the board. 

Seems like the HM-10 bluetooth module is the best option for using with this app. Is there a specific seller on eBay you recommend I get it from?

Just tried it out for the first time on the Raptor 2. Seems to connect okay, but speed is off, like 2x actual speed. I have the teeth settings at 1 for motor and 1 for pulley (hub motor), does that make a difference? Also what should my 'Poles Number' setting be? 14? Apologies for my ignorance, I'm not a DIYer. 
Also, in the main screen, 'battery %' and 'remaining range' would be something good to include I think.

@Mickyboy I was about to leave the same kind of comment 😉, I have the same issue, so for testing purpose I've put the wheel diameter to 45mm, so I can get a more accurate speed. 

I think the problem is mostly on Hubs configuration, it look to me that the app as a problem with 1 to 1 gear ratio. 

If I may suggest, why not use gps.

Still great app and good work 😜

It worked great under beta test. But AFAIK it's mostly a vocabulary mistake between "poles pair number" and "poles number" in the config.
Try 7 if 14 or 14 if 7 (I don't remember which way).

Good to hear it's working for you now.
I think you are right, it's a "pole pair number" and not a "pole number",  I'll fix the label in the next update.
@Mickyboy , you can divide by 2 the "pole number" and your speed should be ok.

The teeth number of 1 and 1 is correct for hub motor, it's a ratio used when you have a pulley. 

The GPS speed and the wheel speed are both recorded when you use VDLA export, so you can verify everything is correct. In my case, the two curves fits perfectly.

Hi Johnny, 
I don't see anything on the map of your screenshot, have you allowed the application to access to your GPS data ?
The iPhone ask you this autorisation the 1st time you launch the application.

if the GPS data are available, the distance should be colorized (green=good location accuracy):

You can use the standard parameter (9600 bauds) to connect your HM10 to your VESC, but it should work either with 115200 bauds. For the wiring there is a couple a tutorial on this website, but basically is:
http://img4.hostingpics.net/pics/995016847251VESCHCconnection.jpg

For the iPhone application, don't forget to choose your BT Device:

Q1;  How or will there be an option for speed kmp/mph in display?
Q2;  .csv file, some of the columns are labeled wrong/different when i view from email(google sheets).
         -motor teeth = 12        (mine=38)
         - wheel size = 80mm  (mine=76mm)
         -the Map when i go to website to view data????probably my phone/area 
         -there are other empty columns but im assuming for ackmaniac.

Thanks for time spent on the app @emmaanuel.   Anyone else have issues writing?  Everything reads perfecting fine but when i try to change settings it shows saving settings for some time and then fails.

Update: I'm wondering if it is that I actually do not have an HM-10 but rather a HC-05

Hello,
Yes the HC05 is probably the source of your problem.
Even with HM10 module the write timeout present in the VESC firmware is very short, so the module need to be good enough to send all the configuration in a very short time.
The HC-05 is probably to slow for that. But I haven't a HC05 to confirm this.
We can buy a HM10 for a couple of $, try it.

I also was/am not able to write new configuration via iPhone & HM-10 module.  Was going to try connecting Vesc + HM-10 to PC via bluetooth and try and write that way to see about connection/writing speeds.  Also havent had good luck with with a baud rate other than 9600... would this be the issue with being able to write new settings?  
With this app I've already been able to figure out a few items/issues i probably wouldnt have been able to otherwise...  Thanks very much for your time and effort @emmaanuel

I saw the same thing. I need to be at 9600 bauds between HM10 and VESC to be able to write VESC settings. 
I've noticed it depends on the HM10 quality. I'll order a bunch of different clone to make some test.

@cody00 are you at 9600 bauds ?

Hi RiGo,

The app is compatible with standard VESC firmware (v2.18 and 3.27, 3.28 and the latest : 3.29) and Ackmaniac firmware(v2.53 and v2.54).
But at this moment the app is not compatible with the new @Ackmaniac fork based on 3.x version, because it's too hard to follow changes he is doing.
I hope he will use GitHub like the others to make it easier and add back support to his great job. 
If this change, I'll update the compatible version list in the 1st post.

Thanks. I love the fact that your app works on iOS. I'm having a couple of problems though. I'm not able to write settings to the VESC as others have mentioned. Also, I'm not receiving emails with the log file. Is here another way to view/retrieve it?

Welcome Rigo,
For the writing problem, you can upgrade the last offical VESC FW 3.29.
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-version-2-0-ios-eskate-vesc-app-for-standard-and-ackmaniac-fw/32340/49?u=emmaanuel

For your email problem, the app use the internal phone email system. Is your iphone setup to send email ? Did you fill the settings in the app to activate this function ?

After that you can arrange the metrics by doing "drag and drop" on the main screen.

Hi.
Did you upgrade to 3.29 or more ? 
A bug was fix in the FW 3.29 to improve saving to VESC across bluetooth module. If you have a 2.xx version of the firmware, this acuraccy  will depend on the quality (and speed) of your bluetooth module.
I recommend you to upgrade to 3.x. 
If you still have problem, you can send me debugs logs across the app, and I'll have a look.
For dual VESC, at the moment the app handle this like the VESC tools, with a "can forward" option.

A couple things I noticed: when you hit the reset button, it doesn't reset the wh consumption so your efficieny becomes incorrect. The only way to fully reset is to turn off and on the board and it would be easier if the button just reset everything. Also it seems that the efficiency is only going based on the wh used and not factoring the wh put back into the battery. It'd be awesome if you could look into these things!

Overall great, thank you!

Yes, you are completely right.
The power consumption is calculated directly by the VESC (and not the app), and it start when you power on the VESC, and it's reseted only when you power off the board. I add this point to my todo.

The app works fine with 3.34.
Take care when you upgrade to 3.34 to setup the VESC correctly.
Can you verify:
- your vesc app is in « ppm and UART » mode
- your vesc uart speed is the same between your Bluetooth module and your VESC (usually 9600 or 115200 bauds)

Hello Kug3lis, 
You're the first reporting this problem. 
I've just checked the apple dashboard, to see if the app crash often.
During the last 7 days, apple report me only one crash (the 5th of January), and 3 crashes during the last 30 days.
If this is correct, the app looks pretty stable.
I'll recheck that in a couple of day, to be sure no other problems are reported.

I have my BT module plugged into the master vesc (ID 0), so I check the box connect by CAN to ID 1 (slave defined as 1 during firmware setup) and it works great communicating with both. 

I assume it would be the opposite, connect by CAN to ID 0 if your BT module is connected to the slave, and it should work just the same at that point.

Android VESC monitor has the ability to access the modes setting. Apparently the Raptor 2 has 4 modes from the factory. Any chance you can add the ability to view and switch modes in the future?

Hi @NummThumz. For what I understand, the android app use only the ackmaniac FW. This FW have a little ack to allow switch mode. In the actual official Vesc FW , the switch mode is not possible. If somebody want to add it, it’ll be great. 
For the iOS app I try to make generic fonction, because a lot of users doesn’t use the ackmaniac FW. For this reason, the switch mode still in the 1st rank of my todo, but I’m waiting a fw enhancement for this.

I just downloaded this app and used it to change some values on my Raptor 2.

I set the teeth and pulley to 1 and 1 because I have a hub.
I set the wheel diameter to 90 mm
I set the poles pairs number to 28 for the correct speed

I set the motor max 60>80 for higher acceleration
I set the motor min -45>-60 for stronger braking
I didn't change the battery settings, eRPM max or the max Watt


I have some questions:
Do my  amp settings translate to what I am trying to achieve?
Do I need change the other settings to accomodate the higher amps?
The throttle curve isn't changed right? I can only do that with the Android app or FOCBOX BLDC TOOL WIN/MAc software.
The slow mode on my remote halves my values and can't be customized, right?.
What happens when I set the amps to 200 max?

![0 (1)|281x500](upload://gy4Cno1tpOZKpBLZ808t7faqJHP.png)![0|281x500](upload://eYpsl1wogY6QEmRq0Ps7QR6ljbt.png)

I uploaded the settings, took the screenshots after turning my board off.

Edit: went ahead and set the amps to 30 max and -10 and the motor min to -50 because I found these settings for the Pro mode on the android app. Whats happens when I go beyond these settings?

![unnamed|281x500](upload://jCYKF7ra47MxYAA0M8BrQqmCtnr.jpg)

After reading some more, I changed settings to motor Min -65 and battery max 35 so it's actually more powerful than the default R-spec mode. I'm not sure what to do with the Max Watt

After uploading new settings to my Raptor 2 I can confirm the settings work.
After turning off my Raptor 2 and turning it back on again however. My Raptor 2 won't respond to my remote. Turning on and off my remote and Raptor 2 won't help.

I managed a temporary fix by using the Android app to set one of the 4 standard modes, the board instantly responds to my remote again.

After turning my Raptor 2 off and on again the board won't work anymore. Probably because the Android app can't override the standard R-spec.

Someone know a way to fix this? Probably worth a bug report too.

I'm willing to test and provide any data I have available.

Edit: Managed to find the write feature (set as standard mode) in the Android app and now my board works fine again. I think the eskate vesc app might cause throttle input not to work anymore after uploading and restarting the board. Or possibly a failed upload?

Tried to reproduce the error. The first couple of times the board would just stay working. After setting the amps to a max of 2 (to confirm settings were being written) the throttle started behaving weird : https://we.tl/sme1Vz3paR

I tried using the 'Send debug info's' but nothing happens.

After this I set it back to 80 amps and turned by board on and off again, now just one motor spins when I hit the accelerator full speed. After turning it on and off again now only one motor spins while bobbling alot. Turning it on and off again leaves me with one motor spinning smoothly again.

![ios vesc|281x500](upload://xC0RE18EjzHOSfX1bXzAWU5wCtu.png)

I will go ahead and use the Android counterpart again to fix it.
Edit: tried using the android counterpart with the same settings and now just one motor spins. Is this a hardware issue?

Edit after turning it on and off again for a few times both motors work again, and after doing that again one motor works and so on. Can I write this off as a hardware issue, is it maybe shorting comewhere for this randomn bahaviour?

It looks like I've lost control over 1 motor, can't get it to spin up anymore.

Opened it up, one vesc has the power light ON and the signal light ON. The other one has a blinking power light.

Are you constantly writing settings when you are testing this?

Read one vesc and check vesc id if it is 0 or 1. Then check the other vesc for the id. 

You could have written both vescs with the same id. This can cause only one motor to work. 

Otherwise just contact enertion support via message on the website.

After a teamview session with Enertion support - (TNX Eric) I was informed that one focbox shuts off below a certain battery percentage/voltage. To save battery or the load on the battery.

I was arround that percentage when testing and that's why sometimes one motor would spin and the other time not.

So it was a feature and not a bug :grimacing:

Edit: after extensive testing through team viewer with Enertion support en multiple ride sessions spread over a few days. One hub still seems te be failing at low battery percentage and no clear reason has been found. I'm sure of one thing and that is that this app hasn't been the culprit of my problems.

When the option is not enabled, the app communicate with the vesc where the BT module is plugged.
When the option is enabled, the app communicate to the VESC corresponding with the ID.

So it depends on what you want to see or modify.

Check that you enabled PPM + UART (or whatever + UART) in app tab.
Check also that the baudrate in UART tab is the same as your module (9600 by default)
If it still doesn't work, check your Tx/Rx wiring.

Hi pat.

You have to check the baudrate of your BT Module is the same as the baudrate of your VESC. If they are not equal, they can't speek together.
Dependings on the BT Module you are using, the default baudrate can be different than 9600.

The connection appears to be intact and nope, no updating of anything. Enertion support thinks perhaps I somehow turned off the bluetooth functionality of the board via the app. Is that possible? They referenced a UART setting, but I don't see anything in the app that seems like it could do that and I haven't tried uploading anything to the board. I've only used the app to monitor mileage and battery state of charge.

Good to know. Yes, official Enertion BT module, HM-10. Upon further inspection, of the 3 wires going from the BT module to the FOCBOX, the one that goes to "Signal" on the FOCBOX is chafed through the insulation and shows exposed copper. The strands inside seem to be intact, but it has definitely seen some chafing. Unfortunately, these BT wires are soldered to the FOCBOX and I don't have the right tools to replace it at the solder point. Maybe I can crimp a little jumper across the damaged portion.

Thx! That was the problem. I deleted the other app, after I got connection👌
One more general question I have.
My Bluetooth modul is connection to the master vesc. If I change motor settings by the app, the slave will be updated too?
I have the old 2.18 firmware and 4.12 hw.

So I got my new BT module in and I tried 2 different ones. I actually picked up the one @DAddYE listed. 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M7V28E3/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_o1djBbSR95A6T

After wiring it in and it connects just like the old one did but it never moves past this screen. 
Is there a setting I am missing to keep it from functioning?

Make sure TX is connected to RX on the Vesc and RX to TX on the Vesc. 

Search again in the settings and select the BH5 Bluetooth device. 

Give a try with the Esk8matics app as well.

Set can forward to off. You slide this to on only when you have dual and wish to change the settings on the other vesc. 
This will not show live data from the other vesc. 

If you have dual vesc, you slide this to on and enter id1 if the slave is set to id1 and the module is connected to the master.

I have dual VESCs and I turned off the CAN forwarding, I have honestly tried lots of things, even redownloading the app. its still not responding past the screenshots I posted earlier.

Is there something I need to turn on in the VESC setup or something I am missing here?

Yesterday i had my first ride with the app. 
I recorded the full trip and looked up the data after on the website linked in the mail.
Can somebody explain why the max values in the app don’t fit to the max values shown on the website.
For example max speed in the app 39kmh (sounds right).
On the website 68,5kmh (sounds a bit much).

One more thing I find a bit confusing.
In the app settings you define your pole pairs.
But the app shows only right values if to enter the single pole number (in my case 14poles, 7 pole pairs, but functioning right only with settings 14)
I think this should be changed from „pole pairs“ to just „poles“.

Hi pat,
Yes, the answer it’s always the same. 
You have to check your bt module have the same baudrate than your vesc. In your setup we can see the vesc is using 9600. That means your bt module use another speed. The default baudrate vary from the different brand/model of bt module. 

I can see two solution:
1. You connect with serial connection to your bt module using your computer , and you change the baudrate to 9600. Ask google for a tuto.
2. You change the vesc serial speed to other default bt module speed (ex: 38400). Save to vesc and try again.

Let me know if this solve your problem.

@emmaanuel I still get wrong numbers when I analyze the log file at the online platform.
During driving recoded values looking realistic.
After uploading the file to the portal, I get numbers like max speed 70km/h. What can´t be true and don´t fit the max/min values shown in the app.

Can somebody please double check if the max/min values shown in the app the same as the values shown on the website?
In my case it´s not and I wanna get sure that I didn´t screw up something with my settings.

Edit: in the graph the values seem to be right, but in the summary it´s not correct.

The only thing I know about is that you need to change the rx and tx for your Bluetooth module as that’s different from the other vescs (besides the escapes, they have the same).
If your Bluetooth works it also should work with the Flipsky esc.

- the graph is not update anymore when you change unit.

So if a try to change the data in the csv file, the statistic part will be fine but the graph will be wrong. 
And actually, the graph is fine but the statistic part is wrong.

I just tested the app right now and cannot understand your point only one part of it.

Visit VDLA, insert metric csv file, everything looks okay.
clicking on the toggle button to enable imperial the statistics get converted correctly. The graph will show the correct values while hovering over it. The only problem i saw you mentioned is that the graph is partly wrong. The value scale is not updated properly and show wrong numbers.

When you open it, the speed graph is fine with a max of 33 km/h but in the statistic I see 53 km/h.

Somehow there is something **we** dont understand....

First there is a problem with the labeling of the graph!
![image|690x335](upload://elFHqTYu4QfByx6z0717dZ3nqRr.png) 
The scale does not match the graph and statistics value. I will edit it when i have some time.

But the true error is unkown....
Here is the [example csv](http://gct-hp.de/VDLA/example.csv). I compared it with your csv. In both cases there is (Speed_Unit=0). In your case it will calculate it wrong and in my case it will do the correct stuff. weird.... i really dont know why this happens... It doesnt even make sense...

EDIT: @emmaanuel  Somehow the values are odd.... your stats says max speed =  53,7kmh. when i look through the graph the max speed value is 35,7. Where does it get the 53,7 from. assuming 35,7 is in mph then it would be 57,45kmh. seems odd to be that off

I have a problem and hope someone can help.

My boards works fine and doesn't have any problem. The iOS eSkate app also reads all settings fine (speed, voltage, current settings). But whenever I try to Upload VESC settings it says 'Failed to save'.

Maybe 1 out of 10 times it will succesfully write my new settings but when checking with the ESC tool on the PC it only changed my VESC settings on my slave focbox. The bluetooth module is connected trough the uart port on my slave because I have the photon remote connected through uart on my master.

When using can forward to ID: 0 (master focbox) The problem is the same, uploading only works 1 out of 10 times and only updates the master in this case.

Only updating 1 of 2 motors could be expected behavior. But it only working 1 outta 10 times seems weird.

On the VESC monitor android app updating any settings never works.

I'm on Ackmaniac firmware

Reflashing this kind of module is not recommended, because there is a lot of different hardware version, and your are never sure the code your pushing is compatible with your hardware.

For all the users problems, I can say 99% of the connexion problems (that's mean: reading infos from VESC to app) are solved with 3 checks:
- Be sure you have PPP + UART in your VESC setup
- Be sure you have 9600 bauds setup in VESC Setup AND in your BT Module (this second point is not always the default setup on some module) 
- Be sure the wiring is fine

The unsolved 1% can be changing the module (I believe most of the time is a baudrate problem inside the BT module, but people doesn't have the tool/knowledge to change it)

For updating configuration problem (writing infos from app to VESC), @jadatmagis is the first guy with  problem with the updated VESC firmware from several month. And it's look like the BT module is to slow sending the configuration. I have seen this kind of problem with cheap BT module with baudrate at high speed, and they don't handle this very good.

Tnx for the help.

My baudrate is at 9600 on the slave.

I'll be looking for a better bluetooth module. Tnx a bunch!

ohhhhhhh,

no, thats on 115200 because that's what the Photon receiver needs, lemme check if I can get it to work on 9600 though

Edit:
Ok so setting the baudrate on my master to 9600 puts my photon receiver out of work.
But at 9600 baudrate on master and slave the app still won't let me write settings.

A new bluetooth remote is on the way though.

You need to setup 9600 bauds in VESC Setup **AND** in your BT Module.
If your BT Module speak at 115200 and your VESC at 9600, this is not going to work.

Hello Emmanuel, first of all, thank you for a great ios vesc app.

I am running ios 12 and every time I want to connect my BL-10 module to the app, I need to delete and reinstall the app. The problem is not in my hardware since I can do serial communication but somehow without deleting the app every time, I can not get a re-connection. After the re-installation, everything works just fine.

Help appreciated :slight_smile:

Other similar bluetooth serial apps works just fine btw.

Hi andy,
We have been looking your problem. In the data recorded by the app there is a peak value in the middle of your data. This data is received from your vesc. Maybe some hole on the road , or a little sliding. The value shown in the website is accurate. You can find the peak using zoom functionality. I can’t do more because it’s not a bug in the app or In the website.
```

That’s ok. Just for me it’s strange as the app shows as well max and min values. The values in the app are correct and not totally over the top. I just don’t get why there different max values in the app and in the online form. 💁‍♂️

Furthermore I can’t reach 75km/h even if I would spin up my wheels on the bench without load. If it is some kind of signal problem I could understand that, but a free spin of wheels is definitely not the reason.

Yes maybe some interference in your Vesc. 
the app is getting sample of the vesc data for the mobile interface . But in the file I save more “values”. This explains why you peak is only visible in the file data.

@emmaanuel hello!

I still have some things in your app I don´t fully get.

On the website your motor min is listed twice and should be motor max for the first position.

The app say me I was driving 3,7km the website tells me 6km. From where is this difference?

The website also says 64Wh drawn and average used Wh are 26Wh/km 

How that get along with any of the riding distance measurements? 3.9km as well as 6km will fit to it.

64Wh drawn

26Wh/km

64/26 is 2.4km driven. So either gps nor vesc data about the range are correct. How you than come to the average Wh value. I just want to understand the logic in there.

Great work Emanual! 
I'm trying to stay with iOS for my phone rather than Android but need an accurate battery meter / state of charge monitor for my ebike. Any prospect of improving your app to use coulomb counting in the battery percentage calculation (or even better, a voltage + coulomb counter algorithm like that used in this project: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/davega-battery-monitor-odometer-speedometer/71509)? Would be popular for other ebikers too when they start using the high voltage VESCs coming out.

hm, that are bad news. It's really a pity that the project was canceled :(
i know only the new realtime logging from the vesc tool which is also very impressive. But for data logging you need a android device with installed vesc tool. Maybe I am wrong but I don´t find the max hold values  for speed and amps. And in conclusion for me it´s a very confusing program for riding.

I hope we soon will find a way for this .. will fore sure boost your eskate App a lot !! ;)
