The Vesc should not get that hot especially with that setup. You might have a short in the motor or motor wires.
Disconnect the motor wires from the vesc and remove the rear wheel and belt. touch any 2 of the motor wires together and turn the motor by hand. Notice the drag on the motor. it should feel like the brakes are on partially.
Now separate the motor wires and turn the motor by hand. It should turn freely. if it feels the same as it did with the 2 motors wires touching each other ( like brakes on) then you have a short in the motor.

Sorry, sounds like the vesc is fried.
Did you say the motor feels like brakes on with the wires are not touching?

cant think of any reason for the vesc to overheat and burn up except a short.
try this, mover the motor wires back and forth and sideways while turning the motor by hand to see if the brakes come on.
You may have an intermittent short that may show itself while your moving the wires around. Depending on how your wires are setup, they could be moving a lot while your skating and turning. 
Also I'm assuming that your motor wire connectors where properly covered with shrink tube to insulate them.
Also check every inch of the motor wires to see if some of the insulation got rubbed off.
