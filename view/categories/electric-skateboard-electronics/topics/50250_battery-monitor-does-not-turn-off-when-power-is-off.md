I have connected my Battery Monitor straight to my Anti-spark switch where the batteries are connected. When I turn off the power the battery monitor stays on when everything turns off, any suggestion?

Likely wired on the battery side instead of vesc side?

Show us your wiring, on diagram or irl. 
The negative goes directly on the battery, positive goes on the vesc side on the anti-spark. :kissing_heart:

Yea, you need to switch the positive end of the monitor to the vesc side instead of the battery side.
