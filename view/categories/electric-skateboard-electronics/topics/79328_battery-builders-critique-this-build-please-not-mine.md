So I saw this post over on [/r/electricskateboarding](https://old.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/aaf770/me_and_a_buddy_are_putting_together_our_first/) 

![image|375x500](upload://oxBhuY32g2qXRcx9kQlwP9t7cbf.jpeg) 

I don't want to shit all over this guy, but what advice would you give?

Things I see wrong:
 
poor quality spot welds
series welds done first, then parallel welds
balance leads sandwiched between cells
no fish paper anywhere
no cell insulators

Or maybe I'm crazy.

Didn't cut the corners either. There are alot of sharp spots poking up thats just begging to cut through anything around it.

I try and avoid it, but sometimes you see something so egregious...

Poorly made, so many things wrong with this pack.

If heâ€™s lucky a series connection will break and it will stop working...

Hopefully nothing bad happens especially in public :/ 

When someone wants to build a battery I always stress to do reasearch and study as much as possible before you buy anything to start.

I stopped using a glue gun a long time ago, the glue is too brittle for esk8. It breaks away and often pulls the cell plastic sleeve away exposing the can. Reinforced tape is stronger and more flexible.

Are you talking about glass fibre tape? I was thinking about using that instead of silicone

Wow well this thread was interesting enough, and then I saw this comment over on the Reddit thread.

"And this is why people don't like the builders forum... You guys remind me of the autist PC gamers who jerk themselves off over their ability to read basic instructions on the web and snap together pre-built hardware despite having little to no conceptual understanding of the components' inner-workings.

That place is a unfortunately ironic amalgam of ignorance and elitism."

I'm speechless. And get this, that was written by one of the guys behind **skate metric**!

I thought they were reputable, lmao. Guess I'm unsubbing.

Ironically, the guy just described [/r/ElectricSkateboarding](https://old.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/aaf770/me_and_a_buddy_are_putting_together_our_first/) to a tee.

Those nose-up kids think Meepo and WowGo and Ownboard and WowMeepGo are the highest quality and best shit the world has ever seen, and that you're an idiot if you think otherwise.

They're basically comparing turds to see whose is the best

Quite ironic that he compared us to PC elitism, because your comparison directly matches up with console fanboy mentality lol
