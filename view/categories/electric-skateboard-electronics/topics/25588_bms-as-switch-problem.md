Hello, 
I've bought this BMS sometime ago:

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10S-60A-version-D-lipo-lithium-Polymer-BMS-PCM-PCB-battery-protection-board-for-10-Packs/32732403488.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.VoZZeY


and put a normal switch in series with the temp switch inorder to use it as an E- switch, it used to work untill now but all of a sudden it doesn't and the BMS is always on no matter the state of the switch or even if the input is open.

How do I fix it? maybe you can reset the BMS you make it work again? 

Thanks for helping.
