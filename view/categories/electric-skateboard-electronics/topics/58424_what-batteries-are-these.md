I was looking at this build from eBoosted - the Darth Maul.

Can anyone tell me what batteries these are?

I'm in the process of my first build and trying not to spend  $360 on my battery. 

I already have my custom motor mounts from Marcmt88.... 
This is what I have in my cart right now (other than below, need a BMS...)
But it seems that I could find something cheaper than the $360 12s2p...  (maybe not?)

Pink ones?
but at a guess based on battery popularity and with only being able to see the photo on my phone, I would say Samsung 30Q.

If you look at the picture in his build thread right above the one you took image from, it has this this

360$ is a lot of money of a 10S2P
If you want a cheaper pack:

The 6Ah pack uses the same samsung 30Q cells.

Yes - saw that... 12s4p.... but wasn't sure what brand, or from where did he buy them?   I'm assuming he is spending less than $360...  :)

Note, he wants a 12s2p. 

Also the torqueboards has a nice bms, which alleviates the need for a spark plug, and is just nice in general.  There are some large advantages to not having one but for a first build it's the way I went. 

Wanted to ride as soon as possible as it's currently my only esk8.

If you've got any questions on your first build don't hesitate to hit me up!  I just finished my first one and am at the point of building my second / still researching and don't mind talking about what goes into it
