Hey guys,

I finally found the time to put together my first esk8 and I currently have a few issues I could not find an answer to on this forum.

BMS: I'm using @Namasaki's [10s Lipo battery setup](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/high-power-10s-lipo-battery-pack-with-bms/10014) with the exact same Turnigy 5000mah batteries and the Bestech HCX-D223V1 10s BMS. The issue is: for some reason my switch function doesn't work. It is always on, so the only way to turn on and off my board is to plug in and out one battery connection. I checked the resistance of the switch and of the solder points of the white wire and there are no shorts and the switch is working as it's supposed to be.
Has anyone had a similar problem?

Vesc: I'm using the hobbyking vesc and with the settings from this [thread](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-configuration-10s-6374-sk3-15-36-gearing/15943) because I have the same 6374 sk3 as well. The issue now is that if I use 36 as the cutoff start voltage and 35 as the cutoff end voltage I can't do a motor-detection. I measured the voltage of my battery pack and it is a bit over 37V. So I lowered the cutoff start and end to 33 and both the motor detection and the power delivery worked fine. Then I put the cutoff start and end back to the previous settings (36 and 35) and the power delivery got really poor and the motor only pulled 4A.
So I think my Vesc is somehow getting a wrong voltage measurement.
I found a thread witch a similar problem on the forum and charging could help here so I will test that out tomorrow. But maybe someone has an other solution to this problem too?

Same for me, my voltage when on is about 3-4v lower

```
If you test the bms without the vesc connected, it will seem to stay on after your turn it off because there is no load to drain the voltage down.
Even with the Vesc connected, it takes a few seconds for the voltage to drain down.

I actually never measured the voltage when my battery is connected. Thanks, I will check that tomorrow too

Thank you for answering so quickly! Unfortunately I don't really understand how this could affect the switch not being able to turn on and off the vesc when it is connected or affecting the voltage measured by the Vesc.

Ok, I wasn't sure if you had the Vesc connected or not.
Some people in the past had thought something was wrong with the e-switch when they tested it without the Vesc connected.

I will elaborate my problem further: When I close whole the circuit of my battery, Vesc and BMS the Vesc turns on, no matter if my switch was in the on or off position. Then I test the switch and again: no matter the position of the switch the vesc stays turned on until I open the whole circuit manually (unplugging a battery wire) again.

Are you using a simple button switch with 2 solder posts or the one with led and 4 solder posts?
```

```
One with Led and 5 solder points, 2 for the LED and the other 3 pins are for NO (normally open), NC (normally closed) and ground where I soldered to the NO and ground pin.
I'm not powering the LED though, but that's the way I measured it too and the resitance was really big when open and really small when closed

It is very uncommon for the e-switch to fail on that bms but it is possible.
I would double check the e-switch wires where they connect to the bms and make sure there isn't any solder bridge.
also double check the wires that they aren't touching where they solder to the bms.

Then email bestech about it.

I rechecked the resistances and the Led switch is working but there seems to be a short between the upper right and the 2 bottom pins on the BMS.

Yes, but I will remove the switch again now to check if the negative resistance is also measured only between the 2 white cables

Iâ€™m not an electronics engineer but I think that the 2 white wires when connected, close a circuit. 
And when you test them with an ohm meter you are closing the circuit. Therefore you are reading the resistance of the circuit.

That makes sense. But I measure -2,45 Mega ohm. Isn't it weird that I measure a negative resistance?

Try reversing the test leads.

If I reverse them it won't show the resistance, which makes it even weirder

I must have done that 20 times now and repeatedly gives me the same result. I get a measurement of -2.45 Mohm with the test lead the one way constantly and I get no measurement when I switch the test leads

The negative resistance is measured between the 2 white leads of the BMS. The switch is working fine regarding that I get 0 ohm when the button is pressed in and no measurement (probably too high to measure) when it is in it's off position.

OK, what I'm trying to figure out is if you have removed the switch and isolated the leads.  If so is the BMS off?  when you touch the leads together is it on?  All the switch leads do is complete the circuit, they are not positive and negative.
```

The board turns on when I plug in the battery, no matter if the leads are touching or not. Then touching the leads or not doesn't have any effect

It's probably just a thermistor, always a closed circuit that varies resistance depending on temperature.

Somehow my problems solved themselves...
What happened: Since the button was not changing anything and the BMS and VESC where powered on anyway as soon as I plugged in my battery I didn't have my switch soldered to my setup anymore when I started testing my board for the first time after having loctited and secured everything properly. The board itself performed great for about 1km and then suddenly powered off. I already thought I smoked something because there was no more spark after unplugging and plugging back in my battery connection. Then I shorted the 2 white wires of the BMS manually again (had tried it before that test already) and the VESC turned on. So I soldered back on my switch and ever since everything is working just fine.

Thanks a lot for your help guys!

Edit:
VESC issue solution: Fully charging my battery solved my issue that the power delivery was poor. Disconnected my battery had a Voltage of 37,5V and as soon as I powered my motor with it it probably dropped below 3,6V or 3,5V which triggered the cutoff start/end

I guess you are talking about my BMS related problem that the switch is not working? Do you also have the Bestech HCX-D223V1 10s BMS and this problem: 

[quote="Muke, post:1, topic:53504"]
for some reason my switch function doesnâ€™t work. It is always on, so the only way to turn on and off my board is to plug in and out one battery connection. I checked the resistance of the switch and of the solder points of the white wire and there are no shorts and the switch is working as itâ€™s supposed to be.

Maybe some pictures of your BMS could help :)

I actually have a very similar model, the 12s HCX-D596. Iâ€™ve about given up on it. I tried the things you described and it still just wonâ€™t turn off. In fact the only way to get the pack switched off was to remove the B- solder and unplug the balance pin set. Iâ€™m just going to buy a new d223 model for a 12s. I know that itâ€™s just a short somewhere but at this point Iâ€™m going to just take the easy way out. 

Thank you so much for trying to help

Do you have a multimeter to measure if the switch is working correctly?
I had testet the e-skate before too and it was only after about 1km of total testing that it suddenly started to work

I could check voltages and resistances again to see what has changed since mine is working now, that could help.

I did other things that I did not mention here too, for example I took off the temperature sensor a few times (just screwed it off the heatsink) and put it back on. Maybe something has changed there too.

I did test the switch with the multimeter. It was stranger that there was voltage between the wires but snipping then apart did nothing to turn it off.

That's weird, so you measured voltage between the wires in eather position of the switch? Did you try taking off the switch and shorting the wires by hand? That seems like the switch itself is defect

Yep did both. I also believe itâ€™s just a defect in the eswitch. Lucy from bestech couldnâ€™t figure it out either. Iâ€™m just going to try to stick to the more common d223v1 model for 12s. Thanks for your time

the solder points for the switch and thermal sensor are too close together. They should have spaced them further apart on the PCB
