**Started this built summer 2019**

I had given up since due to how costly it was. Minimum wage didn't allow me to constantly fix the issues.

*-Starting summer 2019*, just reached my financial 'goal' to buy all the pieces for The Patriot [Here's the link](https://skatemetric.com/index.php/2018/12/16/patriot-build-tutorial/)

I ordered all the pieces at once with minimal knowledge on electronics. I had asked all the questions before purchasing anything and had a general idea of how it would go.

Forward two weeks later, I started **assembling** what I had received. Batteries in series to VESC, to Motors, casing between my legs, everything was smooth.

***First issue***
I plugged my VESC to my computer and only one port was responding out of the two. Contacted Flipsky and they only covered the repairs meaning I had to pay 30$ in shipping. I tried everything to see if it was still configurable but both sides had to be configured.

***Second issue***
I received my remote control from amazon and I try to pair it, the receiver doesn't connect to the remote so I contacted SkateMetric about it and they explained that I had to use the VESC tool to pair it so I looked online, everywhere I couldn't find any information. I gave up on that later and Reddit wasn't of any help either.

***Third issue***
Was my fault, I accidentally left my batteries plugged in the VESC and the VESC was on, it drained them dead when I came back to work on it. 

**Now**
I ordered a new pair of batteries and a pair of balls for me. I will make this thing run and I want to.
-I'm set to return the VESC for repair if it's needed. 
-Order a new Remote if needed.

If any of you can help me just by reading this, please let me know. I will add videos of my issues if requested!

Thank you so much to the people who recommended asking this community, can't wait to get it working!
