I've searched everything I could but couldn't find a definite answer...I know I know, stock evolve battery but that's all I can afford with my electronics crapping out.

Basically my bms or controller took a crap on my gtx, bat error and no cell stats. So now instead of a battery upgrade I'm basically turning it into a DIY just to ride the rest of the year until winter and I can afford a battery. 

So it sounds like my best option is a focbox unity or Flipsky, I'm just unsure of what BMS I can use with the stock gtx battery and I also need a remote if anyone can recommend. 

Much appreciated
