I want to build my own battery packs for my two eboards. Are there any step by step directions on how to build your own battery packs? If so please share.
Thank you in advance.

Can these packs be used? Thinking of buying a few of these.

We have a couple of threads around here like this one:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/building-a-18650-pack-can-someone-guide-me-or-direct-me-to-a-tutorial/5257

It´s important that you choose some usable cells for your project. I wouldn´t recommend to use a prebuild ebike battery.

Make sure their max current output (when assembled in the configuration of your pack) is double what you will need (you don't want your cells to be pushed to the limit otherwise they get hot and fire .....). Make sure also that the cells have a decent capacity - a great deal on rubbish cells is not a great deal any more!

I would weight a cost assessment if a pack of 20 cells with a BMS is cheaper versus buying individual cells in bulk.

@Tampaesk8er Using voltage we know it is a 10S pack so ... 20/10 = 2P pack so 4.4Ah=2*'capacity of 1 cell' --> 1 cell has a capacity of 2.2Ah. Knowing that these cells are LG cells with 2.2Ah of capacity you should be able to find the datasheet and see if their max output would fit eboarding use.

Normal power usage on single drive electric skateboards is 10Wh/km so you would have a ridiculous range on 2/3/4 in parallel.

why that many in parallel? Just 2 would do.. battery pack actually looks pretty okay, especially for that price I think..

Heck, he could get 720W out of 20A at 36v already..

not ideal for hills but enough for flats for sure.

@trampa  Battery leads (Cables) look a bit small.. but you might as well be able to use.

2 would be better.. you would typicall use probably 5-15Amps from the battery.. which is almost half of its rating, to preserve battery, for normal use about 1/3 of max pack discharge is recommended.

If you just want it for testing, it will be okay!

For acceleration u and single drive I dont suspect you gonna need more than 1kw (1000w) unless you are a speed devil.. what is the max speed you will want to cruise around at?

```
25A (max) / 12.5 per cell = X 36v = 900W

Cruising 200-450W = Avg 325W = 9Amps per pack.

4.5Amps per cell.

15amps maximum.
--

3A would be more favourable but, if you go like 10mph I think u might get even 3A per cell load.

--

Range estimate 36v x 4.6ah (safety factor) = 165wh.. 10miles at least should be doable (16km or so at least)

Check @Ackmaniac data. He pulls about 250w at times.. got to go and check what consumtion he gets at 50kph of speed..

Cell might get hot at 10-15A load which would be close.. but he is going to pull about 5A per cell which is within reasonable limit I think.

Plus, supplier of battery also offers BMS's and other products so I think they should be somewhat okay and shouldnt cheat with battery rating.

--

How I know? I tried 400w battery powered escooter.. it works, just isnt as 'quirky' / spurry as my 1.3kw battery board.

```
Before you buy @Tampaesk8er u might ask the supplier can it really output 20-25A which you might need for acceleration at times..

I dont like they say 'for small eletronic devices'' even if 30A is quite a lot.

U should confirm that it can output said amount.

also - tell / ask how much for soldering proper connectors, maybe they can do it for you cheaply, so less hassle on your side ;)

--

For the feel of the whole thing it should be good I think.. U wont be able to use all the power the motor can offer (which size u gonna get?) but for flats and reasonable acceleration this should be enough.

Think about ebikes - they have 10-15A discharge batteries and a lot of times only 250 - 750w of power, 250w for europe, us folks more lucky - 750W I think.. ok they can pedal too.. but they use only about 500W to get till 15mph or such.

im currently using sk3 6374 on both my boards, 2x3s Zippy flightmax 5000mah 20c-30c batteries. I want something different cause one of the batteries is getting puffy, even though all three cells have the same readings in volts.

Ok I get you now.. is there a way for you to read how much power u consume while riding?

U probably would need a bluetooth module and an app for that but yeah..

If u had lipos there might be a difference you will feel in power delivery.. lipos might be a bit more quicker when delivering power compared to li-ions..

what else..

yeh, if you just need a spare pack to get along and are worried about lipos, u might get that 36v pack and still sqeeze out similar range u are having now with 9s system.. at least that is what I think..

You see, with higher power load, there will probably be less capacity.. I calculated some 'reserve' but by not knowing the actual cells used in the pack it is hard to estimate.. though I think it should be close to 10miles for sure of riding.. which might be just enough for you.

--

If you do get it, report the results back.. All what I did was calculating theoretical values and typical load you see on flats. For more info go and check @Ackmaniac works and Metr.At app and similar Data logging options for Vesc. 

After u have done that u should be able to judge is your next battery pack able to put out enough watts for your daily use. Keep safe!

My boards are completed and i have volt meters on both, my son and I ride them almost every day. Check out my pics on "NO WORDS JUST PICS TOPIC. I just want to find batteries that are good and safer than lipos so i dont have to worry about lipo puff and how dangerous that can be.

yeh, if you gonna give the 'new battery' board to your son, I think you should be okay. If they speak english (at the site) just give them a call and explain the situation and then lets see what they are going to say.

Just say you are going to need 800-900W of power at times from the battery.

You might need a lot of laptop batteries to build proper pack. How many do you have?

Also.. it might not be a that easy task, it is recommended to check each cell, before you are going to use. For that you need a 'test rig' to find out each cell's capacity and so on.

Otherwise, that bms might work but im no expert. 

@Namasaki can comment bms choice I think but otherwise I think he wont agree on using laptop cells either.

3A - 5A per cell is not a lot. Best case scenario - About 40cells to make a pack and also then the board might even feel a bit weak maybe. People usually do 6-8P packs I think, when going with laptop cells.

Some ebikes even use 20P packs. (their maximum discharge 20A, so only 1A per cell).

--

Battery you showed with 30A discharge and integrated Bms looked okay.
It might be even better to build your own pack now.

Where are you located?
Some cells can be had for about 3-4$ a piece.
Multiply by 20 to get at least a somewhat usable pack.
80$ + work and you got your pack.

Other batteries here:

https://ru.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size.html

30Q would be better but they cost close to 4$ a piece there (at least 1pcs)

--

Besides cells, you are going to need:

Balance wires (hobbyking ~4-5$)
Main Leads (4$)
Balance port (if u dont use bms, costs cents)
Solder / Soldering Iron.

--

Figure out can you find a spotwelder near your. Otherwise Order with Soldering tabs, might add about 20-25 Eur to total cost (20-30$ extra)

[/quote]

He pondered idea about laptop cells.. I imagine he would need maybe 50cells (6cells in laptop pack = 10packs at least, if only 10cells are bad total), then each cell could output 4A and he would get there.

20A x 42V =840 W of power (full)
20A x 36V = 720 W of power. (middle / nominal)
20A x 30V = 600W of power. (low)

For a kid and not going up hills would be enough.

I tried 400w scooter with 4s, believe me, it works but the difference can be felt between 1.3kw setup and 400w setup.

I see.

Figure out how to test the cells. This might be the most crucial part to make a good pack afterwards.

There are a few users who have built laptop packs but I think they are rare.

One of them is @ Ackmaniac I believe. About others Im not so sure but there were 2-3 other people at least.

The following statements are solely my own opinion.
Using laptop cells is a joke unless your building a laptop.
Dirt cheap low current BMS's are unreliable and simply a waist of money.
If your gonna build with a BMS, spend the money and get a name brand BMS.
The only brands I know of that are proven is Bestech and Battery Supports also known as Supower

I suspect @Namasaki might not like the low discharge current.. then again, if u use only 10A mostly.. it might be okay

10A x 40v = 400w
10A x 32 = 320W

U will probably need this charger also:

I assume u have b6 imax at home but imax is good only up till 24v not 36-42v.

In my opinion, a 30a battery is no where near enough for an E-board.
But then neither is a 60a battery in my opinion.
The reason is Voltage sag which robs you of power and range.
Some say that voltage sag is normal and acceptable. I disagree. 
I like to keep voltage sag as minimal as possible.
To achieve this, I built a 300a battery pack with 60C lipos.
I have found that more headroom=less voltage sag.
