I’m converting my Evolve board over to decent electronics. I’ve got a 10s4p battery with the balance leads wired like this from when it went to the Evolve BMS:

I’m trying to adapt my leads now to a Bestech BMS :

Am i correct that my balances leads 1-10 go to the corresponding 1-10 on the bestech and my 11 lead which is the - end of the battery goes to B- ? 
Thanks for the help guys

Did a continuity check on the balance b- lead and the b - pad and they are connected so I’m thinking my reasoning was correct. Just trying not to blow anything up lol
