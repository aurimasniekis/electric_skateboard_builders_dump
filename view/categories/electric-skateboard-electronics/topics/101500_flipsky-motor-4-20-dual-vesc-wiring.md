Hi I need some help. Recently bought a flipsky 4.20 pro dual vesc and a set of flipsky 6374 motors. The instructions do not list the colours and corresponding wires on the vesc can someone assist? I have  yellow blue and black heat shrinked wiring out of the motor and on the vesc side A1, B1 and C1.![IMG_20190908_091758|375x500](upload://wHIyMf2vNbv7OdLkpXA7ijeZYIQ.jpeg)

never mind the order. if it rotates the wrong direction just make a change of 2 phases or change the parameter in vest tool.

there are no orders for brushless motors, just plug them in any ways and if the motor is spinning the incorrect way flip 2 wires.
