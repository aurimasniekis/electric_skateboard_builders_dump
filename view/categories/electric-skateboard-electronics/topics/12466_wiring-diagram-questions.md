I just finished soldering the Bedder anti-spark switch and now I've got a few questions about the rest of the wiring of my board.
So right now I have to disconnect my battery and charge from that plug. I want a separate charge port. So the spark switch has 3 wires coming off going to an no/off/on switch that controls the power to the board somehow. If I install a separate plug on the battery side of the switch and can I charge from that with no negative consequences? The below picture is a better example of what I'm talking about to help the visual people me. I just don't want to go plug in my charger and it fry something.
