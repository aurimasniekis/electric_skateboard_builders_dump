Amps - Think of it as how much energy you can send to that muscle

You can have huge muscles

```
usually peopl use water to describe.
water tank= battery
amount of water from the hose= ampere
size of the hose= voltage (smaller hose is faster water speed)
resistor= controls diameter of hose.

They use mucle cuz of power relation of esk8 but not the most accurate. it is confusing down the road.
