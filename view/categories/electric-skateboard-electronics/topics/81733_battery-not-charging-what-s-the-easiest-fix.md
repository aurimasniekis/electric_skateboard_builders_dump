Looks like the nickel strip is cooked would be curious why exactly, is there a bad connection to the cells with the spot welding?  Also think best bet is probably just whole sale replacement otherwise would want to rip off all the strips and check the cells individually to see what condition they're in.

@Kempo1  Here are some of your options, in approximately ascending order of difficulty:

Check your charger.
Check your BMS.
Check your cells.
Check your connections.

Rip off the old cooked nickel and replace it with either more layers or thicker strips.

Replace your cells and do a better job with the nickel next time.

That’s how shitty of a job they do when you buy it from a company they mass produce cheap stuff. Thanks for the info.
