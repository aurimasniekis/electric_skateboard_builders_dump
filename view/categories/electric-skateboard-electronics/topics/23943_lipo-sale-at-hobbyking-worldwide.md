Just a quick heads up that Hobbyking are having a 24 hour sale on batteries so if you are in the market for a lipo or 2 then it might be worth checking out.

I got excited there for a moment. until I realised that its only selected batteries, and my current favorite turnigy 5000 isnt one of the sale items. and is still cheaper.
