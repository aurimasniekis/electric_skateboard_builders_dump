Just got my new vesc 4.12 hooked up and I'm trying to program it,  when you power it on (USB cable connected to windows 10 or 7 computer) it will stay on and connected to the vesc tool for a few minutes.  After that it start disconnecting and reconnecting in device manager every few seconds and the green led reflects this, blue led stays on.  If you remove power wait a few seconds and then power it back up, same thing happens almost right away, the longer it is disconnected from power, the longer it will stay running.  using a DeWalt 20v battery for power right now, but also tried a lab power supply from the 8v minimum all the way to 30v (PSU max)  and the same thing happens.  Tried every usb cable I have too lol.  I'm dumbfounded by the way it behaves, seems heat related or something to do with capacitor charge time.  I also am not seeing the 3 red flashes that a lot of people mentioned, is this normal?
