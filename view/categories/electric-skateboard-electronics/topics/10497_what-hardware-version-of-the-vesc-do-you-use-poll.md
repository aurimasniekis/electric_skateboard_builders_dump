Just curios as to what version of the vesc is out there (mainly how many use older vesc version vs new ones), Bust out your vesc, and check for the number circled in this picture:

@Monte 

Not at the moment
4.12 -> four point twelve
4.6 -> four point six

Vedder skipped 5.0 and is now currently working on 6.0, there is a thread about it here and on his forum vedder.se

So this means 4.6 is newer or older than 4.12?
