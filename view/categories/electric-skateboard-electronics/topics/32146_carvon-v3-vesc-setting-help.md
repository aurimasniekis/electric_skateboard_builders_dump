Hi everyone, just got my carvon V3s and am looking for a little help with the bldc tool to set it up and ideally get smooth acceleration and braking.
I'm told to use FOC and sensored. First time using bldc tool have no idea what numbers need changing. Everything is default currently. 
(will i need to apply settings to each vesc individually or connected via canbus)
Current setup is
Spacecell4 (10s4p)
2x 4.12 VESCS
Carvon V3s
Please let me know if i need to provide more information and ill try my best.
Thanks!
```
