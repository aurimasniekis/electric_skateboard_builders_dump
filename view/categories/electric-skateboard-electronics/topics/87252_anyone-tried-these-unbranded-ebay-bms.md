Looking at one of these for charge only to use on my 11s3p pack that I've built with compression holders. 

I have read a bit on here that with a charge only setup you can bypass the balance leads on a BMS with a higher S count. 

Anyone used them? They seem to be the fastest shipping available to the UK and would rather not have to wait a month for something from china.

Thanks!

For my tayto, ronin, BOA, dual 6355 build that is almost done. I'll get a proper build thread up once completed.

I’ve had a 10s and a 12s have always worked great. Never tried a higher cell count bms with less cells good luck with that.

Why would you ever buy a shitty bms?

That's a really silly thing to do if you're trusting this to charge in your house, or to even properly discharge your cells

I’ve been using this bms it’s more expensive than the one shown but it’s been reliable. I agree though charging batteries is one of the most common ways fires can happen. I always try to stay near my board when charging.

I don't mind spending the extra money on a bestech, only thing is finding a supplier that has them readily available. Any leads on who sell them? 

I've contacted company direct but still no response. Generally my experience with ordering from china has been to wait 4-6 weeks, and this is the last part of my build so looking to get something faster.
