My TB 6374 motor is starting to make an odd squeaking sound at low speeds (1-5MPH). I've had this motor for around a year. Could it be a rusting bearing in the motor or something else? There also some resistance when I move the motor as it is squeaking.
The sound is much more pronounced when I move my eboard backwards, and a bit quieter when going forward.
When I try to upload a video, it says the file is not supported. If you need a video to hear the sound, Ill post it on youtube if I gotta.
UPDATE: Lol switched belts and its fixed...
