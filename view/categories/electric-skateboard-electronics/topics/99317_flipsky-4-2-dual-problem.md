Not sure why this happen. Trying to reach out to Flipsky but they're not responding. This was VESC purchase in June. Was running with Evolve 150kv motor. Used the VESC programming tool and basically the automatic setup. Went on about 5 rides since having the VESC and today one side of the motor cut off. Okay no problem, thinking it might be a loose connections. Took a look at the VESC and no light on one side. Then spotted this. Burnt chip. Anybody have a clue what might had happen. ![Screenshot_20190728-193849_Messenger|243x500](upload://eodZIY9TyyCIHvuzDqq12SrIaQz.jpeg)
