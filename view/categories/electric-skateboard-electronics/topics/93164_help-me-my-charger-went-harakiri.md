Hello there, yesterday I was resoldering charging wire that broke (due to fatigue simply), I did it well, soldering back to the Jack 5.5mm was pretty clean
I plug the charger and then BOOM

Big ol' short circuit spark, scares the hell out of me, and it spot welded the male connector to the female !
It was way more powerful than just plugging 42qv without proper antispark protection

The weirdest it that I unplugged the charger from the grid and tried it again and BOOM Sparks again, so it appears that it is my charger plug that is causing the short

If anyone can help me identity the problem, really weird, the charger was working well before, just this and it causes big Sparks
The charger is dead now, no more light (red or green), and no tension is at the connection...

Here are a few pictures :

Its done for. Next time make sure you fuse your charge port to prevent this.
