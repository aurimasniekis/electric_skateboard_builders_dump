Indeed , especially for the size , [they aren't the most expensive motors I've ever seen](https://hackermotorusa.com/shop/hacker-brushless-motors/outrunners/a60/a60-7s-v4-28-pole-3400-watt-brushless-motor-kv/), but for a size that small I wouldn't expect $200 for one motor even if they are US Made

remember this yahoo with their [gold motors](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/sold-2x-new-gold-evolve-gtx-motors-in-box/53531)?

what a tool.

all the hoyt stuff is nice looking but they're definitely valuing their stuff way higher than it's actually worth.

I meant retail cost wise. Though I did just find even expensive motors than HackerUSA

Motor wise, from what I'm seeing whom OEM is, I don't think they're making a lot of profit , especially at the size these are at in comparison to what the OEM is selling. Motors of smaller dimensions are actually more expensive from what I'm seeing. Goes to show you the cost of US Manufacturing vs China.

[/quote]

The motor pattern conforms with the OEM (i wonder if their OEM also makes their motor mounts or if their motor mounts are made to accommodate the motor, probably the latter) rather than the community, which make sense since this is for their boards first and us third.

100%, not faulting the guys for building a good product and trying to make a buck while at it.  but their pricing pretty much excludes a large segment of the available market.

but this continues to be a problem with niche categories like esk8, it just doesn't have the scale.

The issue is that a remote and drive train from these lovely gentlemen cost the equivalent of a high spec complete build.

That's pretty prohibitive, nomatter the circumstances that led to that price point

Totally agree. I'm hoping their pricing doesn't keep them to deep in the niche market. Sometimes that'll kill a business. If their gear was owned by more people they would be pulling in the $$$. Too much for my blood though. ;)

Oh good that explains it. I knew I recognized those motors from somewhere, their can looks identical besides the rear cutouts.

I had some dealings with KDE. Wanted some motors made for a project. Asked if they had anything available, and they said they were already producing skateboard motors but couldn't share that design.

They couldn't give me anything useful to work with after they asked me to design the motor myself (totally rediculous, not gonna do their work). For whatever reason they couldn't give me ANY useful information about their design capabilities or components kept in stock so that I could actually design a motor to be produced by them. So they lost my business.

Bloody expensive too, and they couldn't justify the price to me besides "they're quality," lol okay buddy

Similar but no cigar mate.  They are completely different motors.  I thought that but a member put me straight when we did a pic comparison via pm.  They are what they say they are but just too expensive.

I'm sure you could use the money you save and get a powdercoating gun. Do it proper!

https://www.eastwood.com/eastwood-original-diy-powder-coating-gun-and-curing-oven.html

$400!!! that is a huge markup for these little motors since they are obviously made at the same factory as the turnigy motors. The community is way too informed to get away with prices like these.

@sofu mentioned something about those expensive motors here:

[quote="sofu, post:28, topic:69531"]
Regarding the motors, I can’t disclose their supplier, but they’re based in the US...

way too expensive, their deck, enclosure and battery system and even belt tensioning is very interesting, but that motor and remote is just not for many of us, definitely not at that price.

If there were made in the USA they would state it on their product page, instead they use the phrase, "designed and engineered in Oregon"

I have no love for this type of marketing. You can have these motors made to your specs from sunray. They also make the trampa motors. Ask for Nelson.

That's hard to say to be honest. I don't think they're worth $200, but I realize their position because they're not exactly making much selling it for $200 (I know their baseline cost).

I got them for free even though I wanted to pay for them. I've been running them for a few months and giving them feedback on how it runs and what settings I'm running them at

I know what those motors cost also, the actual retail is roughly $100 to $120 if you are only ordering small quantities, 50 to 100 motors. JJ seems like a great guy, I have had the pleasure of corresponding with him a few times but it is hard to overlook such a huge markup.

Yeah I love them on my board and I've tried a few motors, but I'm certainly no expert. I was thinking of getting some more for my upcoming builds actually but I gotta think about it some now...

I wish that were true but sadly it is not, maybe it is half true? I know of plenty of Chinese companies that supply motors to various military contractors. 

@sofu If you really want skin in the game you should have sunray or brother make a short run of motors to your spec.
