Hi, im looking for a 10s BMS with a 60A continuous discharge rate. Im in kinda of a hurry and need it fast though. So im looking for a good dealer where i can get a good BMS fast. Anyone know any? I live in Europe.

Thats nice, but there is a 60$ shipping fee, would like to avoid paying more for shipping than the BMS

Ordered twice from supow, had it within a week both times from them. Think bestech is abit more popular tho.
