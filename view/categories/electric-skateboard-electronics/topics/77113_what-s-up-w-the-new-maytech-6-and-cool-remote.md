They sent me a dealer price list but not much info on it.  Any info? Bulk price is almost same as the flipsky6 and this case looks awesome and the bolt mount.  ![image|690x387](upload://c2q9m0UDcUAVHKUMEuhD84pEW9A.jpeg) 

And really liking their remote and see no info there but have prices. ![image|281x499](upload://hYbMZtlkydnUmzMej0sqCQwo70.jpeg)   Bulk price we could group buy. Wireless charge. Waterproof.  This looks like what I just saw someone else selling for 200$. we can do way cheaper.

I think they've reached out to loads of people about the remote. $129?

I'd like to see their finished model and them send out a few samples for people to review.

180 for GB price

That's less of a group buy. It's got a mark up on it because they need to turn a profit. It's understandable, they are a business.

I just know what I can read here and in the thread from @hyperIon1 it¬¥s 160 when reached 20 pieces. 20 pieces or me already a group buy @brenternet
That the price is not top... that¬¥s an other thing.
Still can¬¥t imagine that it¬¥s nice handling with the two different trigger for break and throttle.

@brenternet posted the correct bulk price at 129.  160$ is probably close to what I‚Äôd have to sell it for with costs of Shipping from China and shipping in USA and insurance and insurance fees to China.

Yea looks like more costs than seem at first sight.  Thinking about it i don‚Äôt think I do it cheaper but maybe the esc. Maybe.

Yes. We know.  It‚Äôs not about profit in group buys we do. It‚Äôs about covering cost, providing a SERVICE and giving back a little to the community. 
We understand that everyone can‚Äôt spend top dollar on everything. We are still to close to being customers ourselves. 
We don‚Äôt do it blindly. 
On products we know and trust. No problem. 
Just hosted a group buy on motors. Great prices and covered shipping. 
Our goal is not only to turn a profit, we have always stated we want to bring quality products with choices at affordable price and make them more available than 2-3 weeks delivery. 
Low prices can be achieved if the customer base is there. Volume creates the opportunity to lower prices unfortunately most resellers don‚Äôt do it. 
We wish to change that. 
I‚Äôm hoping to have a small number of remotes and Maytech6  when the 6880 motors ship at the first of the year. As for the remotes we only want to have a small number at first because it‚Äôs new and people on the forum want to test it. I don‚Äôt think I would commit so many to something no one can report on. 
That‚Äôs why we have 6 remotes coming and available at 135$ ( for testing ) 
I also have the duel 50a coming as well. 
Stock motors shipped today from China

 I jumped without thinking about the costs and even thought it was 125 not 129. But you sell it at a gb price vs stores!  I assumed not by excluding all math.  Damn it was gunna be cheaper. Anything new n shiny like that I want one. @hyperIon1 hope u get the people. Maybe I‚Äôll join

I didn‚Äôt see any of the thread on the remote does anyone have one.  I‚Äôm so hoping it will be good. Hoping (there‚Äôs no imoji).  I‚Äôve been repeatedly let down n back to old mini trigger.  How bout some break tests!  Not brakes. I always end up launching it, or better using it as a slam/slider. Hate to break it. Love ‚ù§Ô∏è to sink it with resin all around the electrons.   Surely some resin or just a couple coats or maybe be fixable 


Or the esc?  Nice to see another esc.

The only thread is the one linked originally. It seems the plan it for a select people to test them:

[quote="hyperIon1, post:29, topic:76748, full:true"]
I will order my sample limit 5 and have them shipped with the 6880 motor order.
once we have some feedback from the testers for the community
we can work on a group buy
[/quote]

[quote="hyperIon1, post:43, topic:76748, full:true"]
we will have 5 units at the first of the year in the hands of community members for testing and reporting.

I will try to get a few more at the sample price and will let everyone know.

it‚Äôs looking like $138 shipped in the USA
limited testing unit price
5 units
5 are spoken for,
I will have a reply from Eileen from maytech on Monday
[/quote]

And then if the remotes check out the group buy will go through, which i think is the best way for Maytech since I do not trust their remotes at all.

@Hummie you can take my spot on the testing list if you'd like. I just took on a huge project at school and i don't think I will have time to test the remote throughly. I want the community to get the best feedback. I just won't have time. The price is $138 shipped. Just let @hyperIon1 know

because we just don't have the time to test everything it makes sense to turn it over to those who will be using it for testing.

Yes. What esc are you using? Unity if memory serves me right?

Stalking complete and assuming this is going on your hellboy build:

I ordered a set of [jst 2 pin 1.25mm pitch connectors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013JRWCBU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_VfSFCb9TXVMMM) and am confident you can plug and play this with the aux port in the corner of the unity. Don't even need to connect ground.

Red wire on jst connector to red receiver wire.

Edit for clarity: use jst ph 2.0 ph connector instead

BTW @venom121212 that plug is too small for Unity

I am setting up the new Maytech R2 style remote with Unity. I am calibrating everything the way I did with the Hoyt Puck. In this case however, the Maytech does not run the motors until exactly 50% on the trigger. If I lift my finger off the trigger, and the motors are off, then the wheels are braking hard, they cannot be turned by hand. What is going on?

Not with me at the moment.

But the calibration of this remote is a bit weird, the trigger must only been use for acceleration and the thumb is for brake only.

RRight. After calibration the trigger only works past 50%

Otherwise the break is ON if your finger is off the trigger

There might be something wrong with the remote.

Maybe you could post some screenshots of your calibration parameters?

@Andy87 Yeah pretty much, but this remote is also desing for Esurf, which usually requires the remote to automatically apply the brake.

Ok, We need pictures of everything you're doing to set up the remote in the unity tool configuration. 
Something isn't set up right........

Hi Cory, I figured this out. The guided calibration for Unity works fine. BUT you have to calibrate the trigger AND the brake. In other words, squeeze the trigger, and then the brake. This new remote works great with Unity after that! Maybe this should have been obvious but I guarantee someone else will make this mistake.

I have tested two and they work the same.    Bad thing is every power up you still need to power remote  first and press both triggers one at a time then power the board.    I have no cutouts and granted it can be a learning curve for the finger and thumb trigger but when you get the hang of it, throttle and brake have great control and to gun it full throttle or brake it has resistance for confident smooth pull.     I haven't dropped it in a puddle yet or fallen in Lake Washington but ya never know.  ![20190212_115559_HDR|690x388](upload://17SV8xEKo6GyG6HxGziW1XCXTY2.jpeg) ![20190212_120442_HDR|690x388](upload://dzkf5Wc0HldyUT2bCM11w5o1h6X.jpeg) ![20190212_122449|690x388](upload://iACEDmUVK2tvFleHVGKiqLth6gZ.jpeg) ![20190305_000448|281x499](upload://rmbrpl2kGpjck6ALs9a3luL0vQC.jpeg)

This next Subsonic eC40 build tomorrow purchased the Maytech remote as well.    So as you can see Subsonic electric Century 40 decks are different color.    After this one the rest will have the same red on top deck.    They are trying to keep electric separate from manual board colors.
