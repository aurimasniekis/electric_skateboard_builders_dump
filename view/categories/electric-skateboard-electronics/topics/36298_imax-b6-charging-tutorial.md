Could anyone help me charge my batteries for the first time? This charger is confusing me and I'm not sure of the settings to use. 

Imax B6
12v 3A Power adapter

Thanks for the link. That video kind of sucks though.

In the video he sets the charger to 'LiPo Charge'. What about the other option, 'LiPo Balance'...don't I want that? I'm charging 2 3S wired in series. 

What Amp do I set the charger too? 3A? 5A? My ac adapter is only 3A so I'm guessing 3 max?

BTW, I'm feeding the power (red and black from the charger) through my balance adapter. Not sure if this changes anything but this is why I'm asking because I don't want to start a fire.

you are supposed to plug your balance wires straight into the B6.  the two wires are for discharging not charging

Peep this link. I have it wired up just like this. Paging @lowGuido !

[how to charge electric skateboard battery by Low Guido's Chop Shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5gi35AtPSw)

_From the video description:_
`    Before anyone says anything about charging high current through balance leads, the imax B6 has a 12V input and 5A max output. charging 6S has a full charge voltage of 25.2V with the step up provided from the imax B6 that gives a maximum output of around 2.4A it is perfectly acceptable to charge at 2.4A on the 22AWG balance leads.`
```

```
yeah so set it to 3A 6S if thats the max of your adapter. the reality of it is that it wont go higher than 2.4A anyway.

select lipo charge or lipo balance and then hold down the start button for a few secs. it will check and then you press start again to start charging.
its a pretty smart charger, if you do anything wrong it will alarm and not let you charge anyway.

The voltages of each cell in your lipos shouldn’t be below 3.2v check them and see what they are at. If it’s lower Han 3.2v you’ve discharged them too much

I checked and they are like 3.7, 3.7, 0.2, 0.2, 0.18. New batteries from HK...

Go to hobby king and fill out an RMA and have pictures of the battery voltages, they should approve quickly and then they will send you new batteries ,just may take a couple weeks

Shitty. What could cause a new battery to get this low? I'm fairly certain when I first got the batteries I checked the cells and they were all around 3.8 and now 4 of 6 are super low...they've beens sitting up until this week when I started hooking everything up and I tested the remote hooked to the motor for maybe 20 seconds but that's it.

The battery just could be defective , for me it was one of the balance cables had split inside the silicon,because they use cheap wires but seems like you just got an unlucky battery

Thanks. Yeah I think they were bad or I did something by letting them sit that messed them up...Just bought new ones though and I'm attempting this again. I got everything plugged up and I think I'm ok for now (no sparks, phew).  These things scare me for some reason..

I'm kind of confused though about the voltage numbers and such - not sure exactly what they mean or what's normal. 

For instance, I understand that each cell should be 4.2 full charged and I should stop the skateboard at 3.8 to be safe. I'm guessing 3.8 is safe storage voltage also, correct? When my esc cuts off at that number can I just leave my board for a while?

What exactly is the 22.2v number reference also? Is that just the 3 cells added up?

Ok so, while writing this. I plugged the new batteries in to charge. They were at like 3.74 each cell. I started the balance charge and it literally stopped after 5 minutes. Are they charged? That seems super fast...

3.8 is high for low voltage cutoff, just don’t go below 3.2 v and youll be ok ( would recmmmeond a bit higher than 3.2 though) and yes 22.2 is the 3 cells added up.  And to see if it’s charged check the voltages , they should all be 4.2v in each cell

Ok I just checked and they are all at 3.77 , up from 3.74. It only charged for 5 minutes and then just stopped (imax was still powered up, just at the main menu). 

So I'm not sure what the dillio is... is it my charger? It's a 12w/3a..or did I put it on the wrong more/wrong settings?

I would recommend using balance other wise it’s just charging til one reaches 4.2v balance makes sure all the cells are the same voltage and you want them to be the same voltage

True. Ok well, guess it doesnt matter becuase it just stopped again!! Wtf. It's a legit imax b6 also. There must be some setting on here that I'm not aware of. Or it's something with my power supply. Anyone know if I should reduce the Amps it charges at, maybe drop it to 1 or 2?

Ok so, it seems that I can get the charger to go longer if I dial down the amperage. Setting it to 2A allowed the charger to go a lot longer but it still turned off. The power supply was pretty hot also... 

I'm trying again at 1A. Will this be a problem (aside from slow charge) or degrade the batteries?

At 1 Amp now going strong (yet slow). Packs are balance charging slowly with no shut down and the power supply isn't hot. I just hope that this doesn't damage the batteries or degrade them in any way, charging slow.

2x 3s in series

20-30C discharge

I think i'm using the basic batteries that most people start out with on here. The Hobby King ones.

The charger has been going ever since i dropped the amps on the iMax B6. slowly charging them up. All of the cells are at 4.14 now

Check out rcgroups.com see if you can't find a used charger and power supply setup above 500w. For under $100 you can significantly increase your charging speed.🙂. I have a 50w HK charger and I couldn't imagine charging a monster battery with it.

Ok well the charger stopped at 4.17 for all cells. I restarted the cycle and they all went up to 4.19/4.2 and they all just kind of hovered around that , each going up and down 0.01 so I just stopped it. Shouldn't the charger stop when they are all 4.2? I think my power supply could be an issue..

4.2 is Max. The cells are individually different. 4.19 is good.  It slows down when they are close to full.

I think you need a better power supply. I assume that the voltage is sagging and making the charger stop.

That doesn't sound right. I set m charger to 1amp and charged the 6S (two 3s in series) in 2 hours (from 3.7 to 4.2).

@TeslaAlex My charger itself doesn't get that hot, it's the power supply adapter that gets really hot.

it depends on if you are charging or balancing.
charging will take.. OMG wait for it.. 1 hour to charge 5000mAh @ 5 Amps.. or 2 hours to charge @ 2.5Amps.
see the pattern? its like 5 amp hours is 5 Amps for an hour....
balancing will take FOREVER if your packs are out of whack.

So while I'm putting the board together, I fully charged both battery packs. 

I haven't run the board yet, it's been hooked up but the anti spark key has been out, nothing powered. I did spend maybe 5 minutes programming the esc and remote but the batteries are showing like, 4.2, 4.2, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.7

Am I doing something wrong, I haven't even run the damn thing and that's what it's showing.

My imax b6 stop charging at 3.71 (a half 3S battery).

One day when was changing amps, charger start again after about 2-3 hours, then finished at 4.2v. Today again stop at half :confused:

I ordered new from HK.

OK, there can be a lot of reasons for errors.

It could be the battery, the settings, The mode, Some safety timer, The charger.
Did you test other modes did you modify settings?
Is it like that with just one battrey, Just do some safe basic tests.

It could be the charger and If you already bought a new one Then just wait for it and try it out.

Booth stops. Yesterday I charging all evening and try change amps, one time to 2.0, then 1.0, 0.1, changing and changing, etc.. and it start charging again at middnight, normally and start climbing..

It seams on 3.71 is something happening  but when baterry crosover it - at 3.72 then start normally charge to 4.20.
