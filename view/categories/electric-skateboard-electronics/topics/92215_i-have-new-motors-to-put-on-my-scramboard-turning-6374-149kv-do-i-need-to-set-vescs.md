You'll need to set things up again.  Run motor detection.  What vesc is in the board?

Maybe an older version of maytech which donâ€™t do 12s foc very well, newer ones have a sticker over the capacitors

You are right, 10s and foc not a problem. You could even go to 12s at some stage

Don't forget to use the brass tube which came with the motor. You have to cut it exactly to fill 100% of the gap between motor bearing (6mm below the motor plate) and pulley. It is necessary because the SK8 motor has no circlip to secure the bell and shaft.

According to FOC if it doesn't work with your esc you can accelerate but can't brake (cut off) so don't go downhill, test it at home first time.

Awww ya. Great news thank you. I will maybe have a vesc program question or two I assume. Also got a Bt chip from flipsky since I was already gonna be doing surgery. And installed a USB extension port from vesc to exterior of casing.to make it easier to get to  instead of opening up everything .When I receive motors I will post the issues if any. This has been very helpful thank you again.
