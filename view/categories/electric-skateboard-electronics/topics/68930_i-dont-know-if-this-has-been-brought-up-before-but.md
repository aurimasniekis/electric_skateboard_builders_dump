I am thinking of doing this for my setup. Is this a good idea? Or no? The charger is a normal DC charger that plugs into the wall. I am wiring two 5S lipos into series, and using an ESC rated for the output of the batteries.

In order to power your esc you have to connect the charging port?

Is there a way to do this though? having the charging port somewhere else obviously. I just dont want to use BMS, but i will if i cant figure out this setup...

You don't have to have a bms or a charging port. Get a 20.00 imax6 hobby charger and your good. Only drawback is you will have to get to your batteries to charge them.

Well if you want you could attatch all your balance cables to a vga port and have a xt 90 port and you could just plug a imax charger into it

That's not true. Show me one instance where an esk8 blow a lipo... I'll wait.

Edit: they aren't "needed". They are recommended for a safer setup. Ive run lipos with no bms and ive run li-ion with no bms. For fuck sakes ive gone months with out checking levels and nothing. No fizz, no fuss, no puffs and balanced with in .2 @ most. I'm not saying it cant happen though. You mistreat lipos or li-ion and you will pay dearly. With your board, your life or both.

Then you use a hobby charger when charging... This guy wants to plug a DC brick ontop of his main terminals, thats a huge difference..

So in a complete answer, no, it will not work. You will need a bms if you want to use a dc charger, but if you don't want a bms, then you will have to use a lipo charger. Sounds like you need to do some more research before starting this build. Good luck building.

This is a really bad idea, but it will work.  It means you have to take your skateboard apart and put it back together every time you charge it.  Which means you will run the battery all the way to dead before you charge it.  Which will reduce the battery life and reduce the amount of fun you can have and make it useless as a commuting tool.

*TL;DR: USE A BMS!*

Or you get a multi pin charge port then you just have to plug in the balance charger with no disassembly. 

@Tee.Revv I wouldn’t do that though you wanna know why, I used to and it sucks. When I rebuilt my two boards I added a bms to both and it is so much easier. The only thing I miss is being able to monitor each cell while charging

Yeah, that's the only con.  I don't like that either.  It's waaaay worth it to have a BMS though

I’m actually considering adding a second set of balance leads that goes to a 11pin plug and then making a wiring harness to plug in the two battery medic cell checkers I have. Then I can use them to balance as well as the bms and it will give me a way to make sure no cells get over charged a little

We need a custom esk8 BMS that has bluetooth for this :arrow_up: and is extra-small because it doesn't run discharge through it.

I'll just drop this here.  Disclaimer: I have used this, but it hasn't been in use long enough to know how good it is.  But, it's $9.11 shipped to USA for a charge-only 10S BMS and it's physically very small.

Thanks @everyone, for the input. I realize that the initial picture I posted is really mundane, and obviously would not work very well. Im going to go the balance charger route and just make sure that when I assemble the housing for the board that the battery cables are easy to get to. Thanks all.

Fun fact: if your trying to keep costs down it’s actually cheaper to use a bms, just sayin. 

A bms and charger can be had for about $25

Where as a balance charger is about $25 and then you need a power supply to run it which is another $10-15
