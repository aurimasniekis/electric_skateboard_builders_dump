Hi there amazing board builders!

I'm looking for some advice on what parts can work together and what's the best bang for buck. I wanted to buy a self built board but someone else got there earlier :frowning: I'm looking for around 25-30 km/h top speed and with a range of around 15 kilometers. Would be cool if I could charge it in 3 hours or less for my daily commute. I was looking into some clean Alien stuff but I would appreciate some feedback and advice for what is best; 6S 12S etc. My budget is around 500 excluding the board, because I want to try and use my old longboard.

Thanks in advance!

Go with a 6S Hobbyking ESC, two 3S Lipos in Series and a SK3 Motor plus GT2B transmitter. Just like I did in my 400€ build.

And if I get all this stuff I'm ready to rumble? Or do I still need to get stuff like bolts and custom enclosures? I have acces to a laser cutter and a 3D printer if that helps.

You will need to add import duties on those parts from non EU suppliers though...

Hi there, i´m also in the Netherlands, and i have plenty parts from my old build, wich i don´t going to use any more. In the near future i will start a completely new project with hubs, then i don´t need this parts, if you are interested or someone else i will be happy to sell them for few bucks, really cheap i mean.This include the first motor mounts from enertion, with spare pulleys also, radio gt2 from HK, battery charger x200 from HK, speed controller with enclosure from alien power for 2 motors, aluminum battery enclosure for alien 6s and it fits perfect! it was complete working combo until the motors fail and then after that the battery died forgot.:wink:

Looking into getting a used one right now from a fellow Dutchman, but if it isn't the quality I need it to be I'm definitly interested in your parts! So all I need with your parts is a motor and a battery?

Small packages are relatively cheap to ship, did quite some research on it. If the dimensions are  between 100x50x50 cm and below 10 kgs shipping is under 20 euro.  Besides in your position i would go for the total drive. Saves alot of $$$
