Has any one ever attempted or modded their Sk3 to have silicon wires by opening it up and re soldering on new wires?. Im finding with the original wires of the Sk3 are very stiff and the only pivot point is where the leads exit from the motor which may cause stress and possibly even fray the wires on day.

Just took apart my SK3, doesn't help gaining access. 

Just  remove the heat shrink and cut the wires there, leave yourself enough to solder onto then add your new wires.

I do this to most of my motors because the wires are so stuff and often break when flexed. you just need some basic tools to get the motor open.  Sometimes the phase wires dont like to 'wet' to solder.  not sure why but hopefully you dont have that problem.

## \#13 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2016-05-10T14:20:45.858Z Reads: 362

just clip off the existing leads up near the motor can, but leave enough to work with. Then on each of the three phase wires take your 10 or 12 AWG superworm and make a nice butt solder joint, and heat shrink it. Then when you have all three done, heat shrink all three of them and try to shove some of that heat shrink tube up into the motor housing if you can to alleviate stress on the solder joints. 

That's it. The existing phase leads on the motors are designed to handle the motor's full capacity, so you don't have to go all the way to the windings because there is no bottleneck issue. This is done purely out of convenience, and possibly safety, because superworm is springy and behaves better and will take more abuse, so its just better to use it on phase leads than the stock ones. 

i do this will all of my motors with the exception of R-SPECS which come stock with the good superworm-type leads. The only reason i would change those is for aesthetic purposes.

```
yep! I mainly do this because i need the springyness of the superworm to keep the wires arranged neatly. Between this and the location of the wire channel terminals, i have zero stress on the phase leads, so they're less likely to yank around and cause shorts in the motor, and the superworm is pretty tough stuff despite feeling soft. It can take abuse, and it will never crack and peel from flexing like the factory wires usually do on NTMs for example.

I performed this mod tonight. it came out pretty good. just that my sk3 has a different sound like it sounds deeper and has more of a buzzing sound. Im not sure if its  i should just ignore it or if there is a problem. The motor still works just as good as it did. @longhairedboy and ideas?

Maybe try using some type of solvent that is good at eating plastic (epoxy)

when i replace the leads on motors i don't go all the way into the motor can, so enamel isn't an issue in that case. But if you're having trouble getting solder to stick to the wires in there then try either a knife to scrape it off or maybe even removing it with acetone or nail polish remover.

For getting the covering off the wire, the best/easiest method is just to use a knife to scrape it off. that or a really high heat soldering iron can melt it off.

Yeah, that seems to be the cause of my problem, went too close to the can.  Will try using a knife to scrape off the insulation when I get a chance.  Thanks guys. :thumbsup:

if it is the original windings (stranded wire, not a single solid one) a hot soldering iron might be the better choice so you don't accidentally cut a wire or miss one.

220 grit wet/dry sandpaper might work pretty good too. Don't get regular cheap sandpaper because it sheds like a mangy alley cat. Beats the hell out of scraping. Heat seems like the only other practical solution that has already been mentioned. With heat it may be difficult at times to control how much you burn off. Be careful!

did the mod as well and very happy with it. had my doubts about the soldering connection ... was really hard to get the coating off. but the connection is strong and the resistance through all phases is equally low.

added really thick shrink tube with glue inside that i sticked in really far into the motor. that stuff becomes really stiff once its cold and the glue additionally suppresses any movement.

I measured the phase wire resistance before and after the mod. probably doesnt mean much though. good test is probably to send a lot of current through the joint and check if it heats up more than the rest of the wires.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BIowTPVhosN/?taken-by=longhairedboy

I used heat shrink on the individual leads and then grouped them together with a wider piece as well. 

These were probably the easiest motors to do this to so far.
