did you pay for the insurance? That's what they will pay if they decide they are at fault.

As for the actual fair cost? Should be the average of other battery makers at your pack size

You may count the materials for it (they'll ask for receipts) ; Else I'm not saying that you could have a company to _make_ a bill for your battery cause that'd be fraud. :v:
