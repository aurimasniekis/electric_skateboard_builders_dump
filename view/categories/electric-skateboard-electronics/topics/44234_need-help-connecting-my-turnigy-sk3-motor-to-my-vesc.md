The connector for my Turnigy SK3 motor is banana plug, while the connections on my VESC is phase wires i believe. Is there some adapter i need to use?

Either (A) buy some 4mm bullet connectors (those are what the motor has) and solder female ones to the vesc in place of the 5.5mm (I think) ones there now, or 

(B) buy some 5.5mm bullet connectors and replace the ones on the motor. 

The third option is to just directly solder the wires together.

The fourth option is to buy both sizes and make some adapters.



Make sure to measure the inside diameter of the bullets on the vesc before you buy plugs to match, there are 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5 and 6mm bullets, and you have to get the size right.

Well then, does anyone have any extra 4mm female bullet connectors?

@Snowi I've got some extras, but it might be hard to fit the 10AWG wire into the ends for soldering. You might want to go with 5.5mm to match your VESC

my battery, which has 10awg wire connected to the bullet connection, has 4mm. so i would think it wouldnt be too hard right?

It really depends on the exact bullets you have. Some have more room in them than others. It never hurts to go a little bigger. I personally like the 5.5mm bullets more than the 4mm ones with the little spinny springs. They just seem more robust, and considering how much power we push through them, robust is definitely a good thing.

@grecoman was going on and on a while back about his eternal and undying love for 8mm bullets.

Im just saying that bc i want all my parts to be all the same connections. most of parts are already in 4mm bullet connections and if i want to buy a bigger one, it just means that I have to buy more parts and do more work

I just had the same issue, I went for 5.5mm bullet connectors. I feel like it's better to go too big than too small (too small = high resistance = heat).
What parts do you have using 4mm bullet connections ?
I personally have everything in XT90, and 5.5mm bullet between the VESC and the motor.

5.5mm seems better imo, I have 4mm bullets on my phase leads and they rattle themselves out on rough roads. I've heard 5.5mm bullets do not do this

They certainly take more force to plug/unplug. You can get solid 4mm bullets but they're not that common, and I've never trusted the two-part ones.
