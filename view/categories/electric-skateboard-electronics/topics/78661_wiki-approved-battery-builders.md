yes and no 

I have built custom packs in the past and will do it under special circumstances but the usual answer is no as I am at like 110% workload at the moment. 

Packs take a long time to build properly and I have a strict policy of delivering stuff when I say I will for Street Wing, so i would rather turn down a sale than keep someone waiting and annoying them.

I can check for your country but it‚Äôs usually the receiving country that has the most issue. 
Duty and taxes on your end along with increased shipping cost. 
Most box board companies can do it because they use cargo ships ( bulk ) and pay way less on shipping and have less hassle going through customs. 
It can be done but at a price most don‚Äôt want to pay. Unless they can bare the wait time of cargo shipping.

Yes, that‚Äôs fine. Thank you for doing so. As the industry grows so will our capacity to ship batteries. 
You will always have your pros/cons to every thing. Cost vs quality, supply and demand. 
Once one catches up to the other the cost can go down. 

Thank you again for including us. We really appreciate it. 
I can ask my ups guy what it would take to get one to your country if you would like.
