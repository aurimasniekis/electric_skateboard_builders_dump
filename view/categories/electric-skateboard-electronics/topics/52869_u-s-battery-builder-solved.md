Would someone in the US build me a 12s3p/4p pack if I sent batteries and nickel strip as well as a 12s balance lead? Just need it to be protected and heatshrinked. Please let me know how much?

@scepterr and I have done business together in the past and he has been a great person to deal with and have a great wealth of knowledge to me as well.
@scepterr u want to give me a quote?

@dg798 We should have some in about a week. All of our 12s4p packs come with a 60a/150a bms.

I canâ€™t afford the packs on ur website though. I want to buy the supplies and send it to someone just to build for me which would be cheaper

Not really. You'll spend 200 to 300 on supply's then most battery builders will charge 100 to 200 yo build plus you won't get a warranty on the cells.

Darn it for real? That sucks I didnâ€™t think it would be so expensive. Then never mind, I will have this thread updated to no need anymore because I canâ€™t afford it

100 - 200 is fu**ing expensive lol! would never buy for those 1-2 hours of spotwelding nickelstrips to cells..

@dg798 i would do it for you but i am in Europe..

You've obviously never built a quality pack, 4 hours minimum.

Depending on where you are located I would send the cells or if your ordering the cells have them shipped directly to who ever you want to make your battery. @scepterr made mine because he is in NYC and Iâ€™m in Jersey sonit Made more sense.    There are a bunch of guys who can make your battery for you. Thereâ€™s @barajabali in Chi town, @psychotiller in Cali @longhairedboy in FL and @scepterr in NYC those are the guys I know off the top of my head but I know there are many others

Check my packs and see for yourself, I solder them which needs even more time and with good preparation this is absolutely no problem

Spotwelding isn't all

- apply insulators or kapton takes time
- gluing and not having a absolute mess takes time
- spot welding
- soldering series connections, if you are making a flex pack
- solder in balance connections and routing them
- fish paper, kapton, and masking for insulation and abrasive resistance.
- solder or crimp the balance wires to the JST plug/port on the bms
- heat shrink the packs
- solder main terminals, and BMS connections

If it's being sold with a charger and BMS
- charge the pack
- adjust the end voltage /amperage of the charger, and ensure bms is functional and balances
- discharge the pack to storage voltage for shipping

Now let's talk about how many real hours it takes to build a battery. Not just the spot welding. You think you can do all that in 2? Even 4??? Okkkkkk sureeee

like what putting 30 or 50 fishpaper-rings on batterys? 

[quote="Deckoz, post:21, topic:52869"]

i dont know with what you are glueing, i do this in a few minutes with my gun.

[quote="Deckoz, post:21, topic:52869"]

[/quote]
everything is already set up, its more like a plug n play style thing

[quote="Deckoz, post:21, topic:52869"]
solder in balance connections and routing them
[/quote]
if you know how to route correctly, this will not consume time, what are you doing, drawing a map for cables?
soldering like what? 10 cables? how does this take long.

[quote="Deckoz, post:21, topic:52869"]
fish paper, kapton, and masking for insulation and abrasive resistance.
[/quote]
sticking tape on things? well, i forgot this take ages..

[quote="Deckoz, post:21, topic:52869"]
solder or crimp the balance wires to the JST plug/port on the bms
[/quote]
a "quality" pack should use ready cables, since crimping JST is a pain in the ass

[quote="Deckoz, post:21, topic:52869"]
heat shrink the packs
[/quote]
putting the full pack in a memory polymer and then add heat with a hot air gun? yes indeed this needs hoursssss

[quote="Deckoz, post:21, topic:52869"]
solder main terminals, and BMS connections
[/quote]

if youre using tungsten tin and need to heat up the thing to 3000-fuckme degree, it will take some time, yes

[quote="Deckoz, post:21, topic:52869"]
If itâ€™s being sold with a charger and BMS

charge the pack
adjust the end voltage /amperage of the charger, and ensure bms is functional and balances
discharge the pack to storage voltage for shipping
[/quote]
totally forgot to count the time i have to stare at the pack while it is charging and accurately measure the temperature every 10 seconds for my excel sheet.

Go build a friggin pack and stop talking about it then. Simple.

Since your the fucking battery pack hero, and everything magically assembles itself, take a video for all to watch your master skills, and let everyone else be the judge.

Even more so yea I said 10-14 hours for FLEX packs. If you plan to isolate everything properly. And I'm not a believer in stiff packs that go the length of the board. I build inside of the smallest thickness enclosure I can, every board has flex. If your battery is sandwhiched on the deck and you build a stiff pack, your eventually gonna have ripped welds. 

So sure take your 4hour stiff pack build. Everything I mentioned was to notate that it took time and added up. Not to say it takes forever. 

But yes if your building a flex pack it takes fucking forever. Your basically building individual groups, all taped and wrapped individually and connected.
