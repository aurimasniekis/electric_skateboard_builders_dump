Just got an email from lucy at bestech with their new bms module, looks promising for a 4wd build![Screenshot_20180111-083455|281x500](upload://ilRGJA7fv1LeTwSdAog3tWQIhat.jpg)

Thanks for posting the photo, I think Lucy must have forgot to attach it in the email she sent me.

Any idea on the dimensions?
