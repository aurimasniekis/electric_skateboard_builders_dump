Soooo...the VESC-X Official thread is a mess of criticize and complaint...I just can't keep reading...

Can someone please point me to a cleaner thread that discusses set-up and settings for the VESC-X?

I have my 2 from the recent group buy and would like to configure.  

I have lots of experience with multirotor ESC configuration, but first time with a VESC... 

Thanks!

@Crushkrew While there are lots of nice hardware improvements to VESCX, I don't think that setup is different than any other VESC 4.12, so this guide by @evoheyax should help a lot:
