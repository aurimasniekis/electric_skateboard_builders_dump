Hey! 

I am using mayTech vesc, and now the vesc tool says that I have to update my vesc firmware from 3.56. It says that the supported firmware is 3.57, which I can't find anywhere. Where can I find that firmware? 

Regards, Ron

Download the new vesc tool and go to the firmware tab. It has all the up to date firmware ready to flash
