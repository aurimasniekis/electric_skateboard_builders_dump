Hi All,

so i think i might have fried the BMS... not sure how to test whether it's still alive because there is a short in the circuit somewhere (the multimeter is beeping on the UBEC).

so:
1) does anyone have recommendations for a 7s lipo BMS?
2) how do I test whether the BMS is still alive? can i do that without that UBEC?

thx as always 
g
