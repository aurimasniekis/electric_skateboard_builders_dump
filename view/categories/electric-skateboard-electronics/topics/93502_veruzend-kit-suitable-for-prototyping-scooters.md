Hey
So i've been looking at prototyping my own skateboard for a uni project, and I'm not sure if veruzend battery kits are suitable for this. Obviously its way easier to change up the configuration with one of these kits, as well as the no solder thing. 

If not, I'd also like to know if they're good with electric scooters? (Considering there are less vibrations). I know people don't reccomend them for just a regular esk8 because they have the tendancy to disconnect (Unless this was fixed?)

Also the best EU source would be amazing <3

Where can I get them? I'm based in the UK so import could get quite high on things
