Hey guys ive given up on my MOT spot welder and have decided to purchase a kweld or malectrics setup. Im trying to work out the difference between the kweld and the malectrics. There is a substatial price difference and im wondering if ill regret not spending the extra on the kweld. Any feedback would be appreciated.

You should be fine with malectrics. Kweld is for building hella lot of packs, or for the curious.
