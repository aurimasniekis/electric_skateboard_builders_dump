hi just bought a 4wd esc from diyeboard and 2 sets of dual motors
wanted to know if anyone knows why they were so cheap and why everyone is saying that they are really complicated to make (4wd boards)
they are coming in 2 weeks hope the pieces work![15427231520|500x500](upload://xVw0Q0aIQIhExzLpSUET9fmzMFw.jpeg) ![15057591450|500x500](upload://o77sD4Qjts4ZqFaZIeSCZj6nHuw.jpeg)

A dual modern vesc will literally be outputting more amps than this 4wd esc (100a total in your case) . It will also have far superior acceleration, good and reliable brakes as opposed to something that will be hard to control. Also less chance of component failure/wires burning out/unreliable remote. 

It's not a good esc. It's what was in the first iterations of cheap Chinese boards. They have all moved away from it (single, dual and quad versions).

They got mad at a customer and posted his details and credit card info, that's a big no no.

If they arrive I don't see any problems to use these dual esc's made for 4wd.
The dual esc draws around 20A so you will get with 4wd max 40A which is around 1500W in total.
1500W isn't bad at all.
Just make sure you get a decent battery which can deliver 40A continues.

Is you really want to make a very powerfull board you should be better of with a dual flipsky 6.6 vesc and just a dual drive.

I got the ownboard dual esc and hubmotors (also chinese shit like many people say on this forum) and have around 700W max.
I have had a good experience with them. Rode more than 1000km until now and I have had no issues so I don't know why they should be crap.

You wont get scammed, you can ignore the people who are saying you will.

Listen to @Anubis over here, he's got his life in order. You should definitely buy inferior parts with a detailed history of catastrophic failure that are not fit for purpose if by the magic of the esk8 lottery the parts your buy actually even work. All of this from a retailer that took great efforts to post personal information of a customer here including full credit card detail, address, name and telephone number with the sole purpose of someone using that information to steal from the customer. 

So in summary, buy parts that will fail and kill you from a vendor that has absolutely no respect for you or your safety, against the recommendation of the DIY community that you are asking advice from. That's a sound choice friend :+1:t5:

Please link the documented examples of those hubs/escs breaking. The belt setups are shit, everyone knows that, check my own post history I have said that. The hubs are fucking bulletproof though man, there is no "Catastrophic failure". The ESCs as well, they're so resilient because they are so low amps, they pretty much never fry without water. The connection to the remotes is pretty HQ too, there are so SO many of these ESCs out there and I dare you to find enough cases of them breaking to make the failure rate more than 1%. 

Yes the vendor himself is an idiot who dosen't care about CS. That's why you use paypal and charge back if you receive the wrong parts, welcome to buying direct from china :+1: If you care about CS then you shouldnt buy from chinese vendors who clearly dont know how to make a proper site etc. You're getting cheap prices for a reason. I dont know how reliable the 4WD is in saying that, but I can't imagine it compomises the ESCs to the point where they fail often.

I mean I've abused the fuck out of their hub/esc combo through thunderstorms, literally constantly at full throttle every time I ride, for like 1000 miles and it hasn't broken. I don't really see any cases of them breaking. I'd also call a FOCBOX in 10S3P Or lower Bulletproof too, the failure rate is just so low. 

I should note the only cases ive ever seen were bad bearings in some of the really old CDM 90MM hubs, but even those were very few and far inbetween. I think there were a few cases but I haven't heard anything about that recently

I should clarify I am saying they are bulletproof because as long as you use them within their ratings, they will never break (in my experience)

I also like the fact that someone comes here asking about the kit he's bought, only to be told he's been scammed. Yes the owner is shitty, but the number of times people have Ordered a kit and then it has never come, then they have not gotten a refund is really goddamn low if at all. I try to say he isn't being scammed, and my post is taken down :I

If you support vendors who have no respect for the DIY community and have "diy" in their name then you are the problem. The future of our endevours here are not based on cheap crap parts from vendors who don't respect us.

If you are unable to understand that its fine, live happily in your ignorance. But please refrain from coming on this forum, which does not support diyeboard and in fact actively discourages buying cheap crap from them, and tell people it's ok to buy from them. It's not welcome. 

Understand?

The components they are selling aren't of a low quality, the vendor themselves are. The guy is just trying to know about if the components will work at the end of the day, and I am talking about the quality of the components only beyond the fact that he will very likely not been "Fully scammed" (He will get them)

Do you actually think these components are of a low quality when used within their ratings? Because DIY shouldn't be inaccessible to lower budget builders. If you blanketly say everything from china is junk, you're creating the idea that you have to spend a lot to get a lasting board which is just completely false, and puts a stupid restriction on who comes here. Literally please show me how these parts are bad, because you're just spewing bullshit.

How am I supporting the vendor by assuring someone that he hasn't just lost his money. Where have i said diyeboard is a good vendor here?

Mine fried within 700 meters. That was with a pre-built board, no diy. 

Search the diyeboard thread and you will come across posts where wires are burned and the ESCs overheat, along with frequent disconnects. 
Most esk8 reviews using this esc (comes as single and dual version too) talk about the poor performance in general. Compared to a flipsky dual 6.6, this thing is a joke...even when comparing dual to a 4wd. The dual will outperform the 4wd,.

Flipsky dual dosen't exactly have a golden record either tbh, but the burned wire connectors yea ive seen that. It dosen't actually break the ESC, you can just plug the wires back in, but yes that is a flaw. Also the jerky performance yes in the earlier models 100% it was jerky, but once you get used to it, for what you're paying as low as 30$ in some cases, it works. If you're heavier too, then it gets smoother out, but thats user specific.

Out of interest, what prebuilt was it? I haven't ever tried the single version of the hub ESC

I said if you buy from the vendor and suggest other people buy from the vendor you are supporting them. Giving them money to continue operating and injuring people is the literal definition of support.

The trucks break -> Yea sorry I meant the hubs and ESCs* I said the belt trucks are shitty like a couple posts ago.  in this thread. 

Scammed comment -> Read 3rd thread comment. Was kind of in response to that, not related to you

China junk -> I mean the products that are directly from chinese retailers, I know TB Motors are from china, but they aren't at the same time? Idk. I basically mean the hubs, escs and a select few other things that are actually good "alibaba" components

-> Its really hard to prove that the hubs are reliable, because people don't tend to post about their 1000th mile on them. If you really want i could find threads of meepo v1s still kicking after x miles and things, but its easier to say there aren't tons of posts about them breaking, and considering the number sold etc etc you get my point. I'll backpedal a little on the ESC because it is jerky, and for lighter people I suppose thats a dealbreaker. The plastic that goes over them also does burn out, but its not actually a failure of the ESC, and you can just retape over the connection and secure it properly to fix it, the jerkyness it kind of goes over my head because im heavy. They still don't break though. 

-> I dont suggest anyone buys from them, I am assuring the poor guy he hasn't had his money nicked

Oh the belt ESC. I don't actually have too much experience with it, I have one but the motors came with a broken breaing or something (Still working after 400 miles anyway) (Replaced free tho :D) The ESC has been fine, but I really can't call it bulletproof. Especially at higher amps (that board has those weird 6354 180kv motors right? there really aren't many of those ESCs around that drive those motors).

Yes, and supposedly that was the superior version due to double layer pcb and big alu cooling block. They were indeed driving two properly sized (by now too small for me) motors. Just too much for that esc.

Ah yeah, the trucks also sucked along with the rims. All in the review.
