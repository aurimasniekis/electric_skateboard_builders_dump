I decided to mod my GT2B using Badwolf's enclosure. Printed the parts at Shapeways for about $37usd. Have had this part on my bench for a month and winter's here!

Why do this? I've never had a single signal drop using GT2B, I trust it more than any other controller.

Here we go..

I managed to take apart the GT2B pretty easily. Here's what I've got:

Mistake #1 is that I broke one of the battery leads when I took the plastic case off of the battery. 

Question: can I use regular solder to reconnect it, or is this nickel requiring a different material? @lowGuido @longhairedboy

I'm assuming that this small circuit is the BMS for the battery, and that I shouldn't remove it, correct? @chaka @sl33py

It's the BMS and it's ok to solder that with regular solder, at least that's what I did when the same happened to me.

Thx @elkick ! For reference, the pad beneath the board can be removed to make the repair easier!

I'm having a hard time separating the USB port. I managed to removing the solder that crosses the PCBs, but the pump doesn't remove the hole-through solder.

Meanwhile, it looks like I could just leave the USB port completely intact and just cut a small hole in the enclosure handle for the USB port.

I mean look, it practically fits already! Has anyone done this before? @chaka @elkick @sl33py

Then I could cover it with one of these dust covers.

Yeah. I cut a hole. Haven't finished the mod yet though. Mine is sticking out of the case a tiny bit. A rubber grommet would be a great idea.

I use to heat the pins and lift the small PCB with a knife so that it has a small gap in between. Then I just cut the pins in the gap with a (very small) scissors. So you'll get the USB  separated.

I got the battery wired up after the repair. Wrapped with standard electrical tape. I used the rbw wire and just cut the channel 3 wire off (the white one) since I don't use it.

I decided to dremel out a new hole for the USB port. I opening is a little jagged; saved a lot of time a trouble though. I've got the battery plugged in and charging. So far no problem.

No. Why do you say that? Are you talking about the V shape in it? I think it came like that...

EDIT: You're right it was crushed a bit. Must have happened when I was putting it in the badwolf case. Anyway, I fixed it.

Nice call @cmatson I was wondering the same thing!

Thx @lox897 it looks like it is possible to get USB to just barely protrude. With a rubber grommet over it I bet won't even notice it. I'm surprised that the enclosure design doesn't just include this cutout by default. 

One benefit of leaving the usb port intact is that it still routes charging through the rest of the electronics on the controller, so the charging lights still work. If you move the USB plug connect it directly to the battery, I think you'd lose this feature.
EDIT: @elkick confirms that the charing lights still work if you move the USB port. 

Almost done with this mod... still tinkering with the fit of the trigger and trying to get everything to line up. I think I'll find a way to wrap the handle in something with some grip to it; a silicone sticker or tape.

Mistake #2 I cut the arm of the trigger mount too short, and had to superglue it back together. It seemed in the way at first so I lopped it off. Whoops!Live and learn!

Another tip, you should make that little plastic thing to fit beside the reset socket:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2bdc3baac5f571eddfe33a06d56ffd0f6fdffae4.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

haha I used a cut in half nail (wrapped in electrical tape as to not short anything).

Works pretty well with a little hot glue.

Made some progress today. Has anyone had trouble using the "threads" in the enclosure to close up the controller? I'm finding that none of the threads are good enough to secure the whole thing together, I was careful not to strip them, but there doesn't seem to be anything for the screws to bite into.

You can see that the battery doesn't quite fit!

Here's my superglued trigger arm:

Once I figure out how to close it up (thinking hot glue) this is how it might look:

Like others, I had to cut away a sizable chunk of the enclosure to be able to get full trigger swing.

I'll keep at it!

Thanks @lox897 is that what you did? How would one use hot glue in this case? pour it into the screw holes and then drive the screws in I imagine. @elkick @sl33py how did you get it done?

I managed to put the whole thing together with screws, though I feel like I have to be extra careful not to strip the threads. Also I taped the battery to the other halve so it does not bounce around inside the enclosure. Good luck with your project!

thanks @Haimindo,  so far that hasn't worked for me, perhaps I selected the wrong plastic grade when I printed at Shapeways... these screws aren't staying put! Also, the fit of everything seems just slightly off, so there is a small amount of pressure for the enclosure being bent to conform around the battery. It's not a terrible fit, but not perfect either.

I have had both some that worked great, and others that immediately stripped out.  I think it largely depends on the print material.  I got some "fancy" colors printed and they were much thinner/flexier than the previous boring off white/translucent ones (which worked great and felt much more sturdy).

I found that a dab of hot glue into the screw holes helped give the screw some purchase to tighten.  I also broke off some of the threaded portion, so "reinforce" it with surrounding hot glue to hold it steadier.  For those two bright colored cases, i ended up supergluing them together.  An exacto will be needed to get into them down the road, but they are not coming apart now!

HTH - GL!

Thx @sl33py. Got it done last night! I used your trick of pouring hot glue into the screw posts, and then I used a very small drill bit to clear a little space for the screw. It seems to hold now!

@treenutter - do you run a VESC? I'd be interested to see new controller configuration if you do.
thanks

```
@MasterCho I got it from Shapeways, and used the strongest offering available. In hindsight I would have printed it in a color (red, orange, white) instead of matte black. While I like the styling, it looks a bit like a handgun I think. I'd rather not draw that kind of attention. I might paint it if I can find some paint that won't melt off in my hand while I'm holding the controller.

EDIT: Per advice from @sl33py above, I recommend printing rom shape ways in the white/translucent color in the stingiest setting.

@dogeatgod yes, I use a VESC. What setting are you interested in? The setup for this controller is exactly the same as setting up a GT2B in BLDC Tool. The mod is just an encasement swap, so there is nothing unique about configuration with the ESC. The one caveat is that it becomes harder to adjust trim on the controller settings because the dials are inside the enclosure.
