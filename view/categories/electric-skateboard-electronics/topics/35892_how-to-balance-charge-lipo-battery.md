Step 1: plug in the charger
Step 2: click SELECT on LiPO balance charge. Can’t find it? Hint: it’s the **first option.**
Step 3: 3 cell battery? You’re cells are nominal at 3.7. Total is 11.1 set it to that. If you didn’t know this information, you shouldn’t start building for anyone but yourself until you do.
Step 4: click start.

At least that’s how the imax works

I don't build electric skateboards I do traditional skateboards and longboards.
