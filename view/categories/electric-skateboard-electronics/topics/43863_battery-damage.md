So i left one of my batteries charged for like 3 weeks, i forgot to put it in storage mode
Could any one tell me if that will do any servere damage to my battery? Because I really don't want to buy another one

3 weeks are no problem. Just check if the battery didn´t lost a high amount of power (if it did, that´s a sign of a broken battery).
I found some batteries, i fully charged and left them for about half a year, and all was good ;)

If it over charged but how dju charge your? That looks perfect to me.. with a balance charger it’s stops charging anyway so you’d be grand
