I did some searching, but wasn't able to find a post that would help.

Which "variant" should I select for the Focbox Unity?

What you need? A remote or a Flipsky esc instead of focbox?

I am looking to buy the remote.

I want to select the correct VX1 "variant" to go with the Focbox.

The list it shows on the site is below:
* Single V4
* Dual V4
* Single V6
* Dual V6
* Non VESC (Or VESC PPM mode)
```

You could try your luck here:

TLDR: Non VESC (Or VESC PPM mode) works with Unity.

It doesn't matter, it just changes the cables they include. Get one of the VESC4/6 ones so you can use the cables if you decide to use UART control

Could I please see the pinout your cable uses to connect the receiver to the Unity?  I couldn't figure it out on my own and UART doesnt seem to work with VESC6.6
