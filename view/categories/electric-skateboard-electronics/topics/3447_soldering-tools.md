Hey folks,
what do you use to solder cables and plugs on your own? Do you have soldering tools besides a soldering iron? :D 
I just found [this tool](http://www.ebay.de/itm/Mr-Jig-Lothilfe-Loten-MPX-DEAN-XT60-XT90-S-EC3-HXT-Traxxas-Stecker-2-3-5-4-5-5mm-/121975459425?hash=item1c664dce61:g:bsAAAOSw8d9UunSP) or [that tool](http://www.ebay.de/itm/A2-Lothilfe-Lotstation-fur-T-Plug-XT60-XT90-Goldstecker-/281891463033?hash=item41a20a5f79:g:llQAAOSwUdlWeIJY)

I don't solder enough of these specific connectors to justify buying a jig. I just use a pair of helping hands which i got for $5. They hold basically any connector and you can move it to the right position and height, unlike those expensive jigs.
