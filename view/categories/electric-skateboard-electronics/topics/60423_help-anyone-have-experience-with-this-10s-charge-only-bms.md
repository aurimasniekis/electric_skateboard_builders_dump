Anyone have experience with this 10s charge-only bms?  Or even better a decent 10s bms to buy on Ebay?

I bought It. I tossed It to the garbage bin 1 minute after installed.
My unit could be DOA i don't know. I just never give two chances to a product.
That's my personal opinion and experience.

Any advice on where to find a decent 10s charge only BMS then?

I've heard references to besttech but they're so pricey.

that would actually work great then.  Do you happen to have a link handy for a 10s charge only?  Have a hard time looking at their catalog.

I would appreciate it so much

Burnt-down houses are slightly pricey, too.  Remember, this is your safety equipment.

Iâ€™m not sure what happened to yours but mine seems to work fine. The only complaint I have is the small balance current

Sorry, what I meant to say was that I'm not looking for a bms for discharge.  Just a charge only BMS.

The only Besttech ones that I could find mention of were discharge as well.  Someone mentioned that they were ~150$.  So it'd be more feature that i wasn't looking for for more $$$

Not looking to cheap on a BMS, just find one that is reasonably safe / priced and what i want.

I communicated that poorly

The Bestech D190 is what you want and is around $25 to $35 in the ConUS

Looks like the bms is used for discharged as well in this video.....

But i guess it`s just at matter of taken the minus from the battery itself, for discharged, instead of P- ! ?


update
This looks like bypass for discharge : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yrYG5skwvs
