working on my first build and i have almost everything worked out, i ordered the semi complete dual kit 12s from diy electric. planning to mount on a aluminum "beer can board." 

my question involves batteries 

is there anything wrong with hooking up 2 dewalt 20v 5 ah (18nominal volt) batteries in series?
how would this differ from say two zippy flight 5000mah 5s batteries in series?

currently on amazon for 105 dollars i can get two batteries and a charger, i was planning on breaking down using some spare chargers i have around to act as mounts/battery leads. 

my thought for wanting a set up like this is easier access to batteries, easy charging no balance chargers etc. 

would love some input if this train of thought is sound?

That would be a 10S2P battery then. I think there are better offers here in the forum. For example this group by here where you would get propper cells in a usable setup.

Two packs of the 5AH cost roughly $80-100 and that would get 20V, but what are the C-ratings?

I'm afraid, I couldn't find anything.
Maybe open one of the packs and hope for a logo on the cells ? :sunglasses:

i searched in the youtube comments section if anyone asked a similar question and found something, this is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zhOpgZPoy8
I guess you have to phone or email dewalt directly to get an answer what C- rates their cells have..

the amperage provided by those probably isnt even close to what is required.

There are Sanyo UR18650W2 cells inside the dewalt DCB200 (20V/3Ah), according to http://professional-power-tool-guide.com/power-tool-forum/index.php?/topic/2857-a-look-inside-dewalts-dcb200-20v-max-lithium-ion-battery/

Sanyo UR18650W2 have a capacity of 1500 mAh and 10C. Maybe the BMS or other built-in electronics limit the output current or initiate a thermal shutdown after some time, keep that in mind.

Would need to make a 4P or bigger just to get what my lipos (in shipment) can do, plus the additional cost.
