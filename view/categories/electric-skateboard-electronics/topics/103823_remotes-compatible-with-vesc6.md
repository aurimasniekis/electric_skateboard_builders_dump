I'm looking into replacing my ESC with a shiny new Flipsky Dual 6.6 Plus. One feature of the VESC that I'd like to take advantage of is the ability to read data from the remote (Battery %, speed, etc). 

Problem is, most of the remotes out there with these features are, imho, butt-ugly and not nice to hold. Ideally, I'd like a small form factor remote, similar to the flipsky nano remote, but with the screen features of the vx2 or similar remotes. If anyone can recommend me something that would work, that would be amazing :slight_smile:
