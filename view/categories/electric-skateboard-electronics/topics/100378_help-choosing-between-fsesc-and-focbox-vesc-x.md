I need help figuring out the right ESC to purchase.
I will be using this [motor](https://flipsky.net/collections/e-skateboard/products/bldc-motor-h6355-160kv-1620w) which has a max current rating of 45A. The product page suggests to use either the [FSESC 6.6 60A](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/fs-esc-6-6) or [FSESC4.12 50A](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/torque-esc-vesc-%C2%AE-bldc-electronic-speed-controller)
Which one should I go with? Can I use a FOCBOX(VESC-X) instead? Or is there any other cheaper and reliable alternative? 
I am not able to find the schematics of the FSESC's. Can someone link me to it?

Thanks

any of the three options will work good for this motor.
but, donÂ´t run the fsesc 4.12 on 12s with the 220kV version.


besides this just choose what you can afford and/or fit in your enclosure.

Thank You! I am planning to use only a 6S pack. The max current of motor is 45A and max volts is 12S.  What will be the continuous current of the motor? Will the max current be the same even if I use just 6S? I am asking this to choose my batteries accordingly.
Why am I not able to find the schematics of the FSESC?

6s will work but I would go as min 8s with the 220kV than.
You can limit the motor max current when you setup the focbox or vesc, so no need to worry about that.
