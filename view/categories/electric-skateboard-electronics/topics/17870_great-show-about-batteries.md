never thought i would say this, but building a board got me very interested in batteries.

there's a show on PBS called Nova that just aired one about batteries and found it really interesting.

if you're curious how they're made, what goes into them, the problems with lithium based batteries, etc, it's a pretty good watch.

 the coolest was the peek at the tech to come using a plastic electrolyte with lithium getting double the power or energy and no chance of fire.  damn i wish new tech would trickle down to me sooner.
