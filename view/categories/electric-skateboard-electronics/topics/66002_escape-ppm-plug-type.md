Can anyone point me in the right direction for the correct plug type to suit the PPM connection for the ESCape?
Seems my servo cable plug is not the right choice.

Thanks in advance

Thanks for the heads-up. I've just searched and found the right connector. For anyone else in the future, the plug is a JST XHP-3.
