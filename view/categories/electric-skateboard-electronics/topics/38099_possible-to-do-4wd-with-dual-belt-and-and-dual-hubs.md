What the title says, can't do find anything online about it. Just wondering if the two vesc would even link up to control all motors. If not I'll just do the quad hub route with the kits from diyeboard.

You'll need 4 vescs

Ive tried 4 vescs over canbus on the bench and its been fine

But @BigBoyToys has bad better experience running can between the two in front and two in back, with split ppm or dual receiver  between the front and back(correct me if I'm wrong)

But hub and belt mixed is totally doable,

Minor addition. If I were going to build a 4wd board I would do can between the vesc on the same axle and split ppm between front and back.

This is mostly because I would run traction control on the same axle motors..... Having non similar axles with TC would probably feel really weird.  Almost as weird as riding without traction control since I'm used to the behavior of TC.
