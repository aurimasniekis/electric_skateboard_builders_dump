Hey guys, on ebay or china shops you can find different esc Substitutes and i think the most of you had they seen before in other low budget builds. It seems to be, that there are existing two boards (for dual motors) which have the same specs but a different platin layout. My questions are, 
Which of them is better under the long living aspect?
Are ther really specs identiical, or has one of them a not listed feature?
And has somebody experience with both substitutes?

Here is the one:

The second one is arrived here in the last days :) But in the case, that it will burn out, i will take the other one.
In my package there was also a heatsink, but i think, it will not realy handle the heat, so i will put a additional heatsink on top.

Is the newer one also speed limited at 20 kmh?

>>GrozniyRegular:

At first, i want to test an e-skateboard and i like to make and build things. 
the problem with the turnigy kit is, that it is too obvious. I decided to build my setup with hub motors, because here in germany it official not allowed to drive with an e skateboard on official streets and hub motors are a little bit stealthier.

And if it seems to be, that my setup is not enough for me and my use cases, i will build a better one and i will invest more money. And the old one will be for my son :D

The first one is the better of the two. The second is for hub motors I'm pretty sure
