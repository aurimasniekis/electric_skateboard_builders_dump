Both my BLDC and power switch state they are rated for 12S but also state 45V. If I understand correctly, both LiPo and LiIon cells should be charged to 4.2V max. That comes to 50.4 V total. Should I only charge my LiPo pack to 45V or would 50.4V be fine? Should they have instead advertised 11S on these components? Or does the 45V rating take into account voltage sag or something?
Thanks in advance for any advice.

Here is my motor:

And my power switch:

I have personally used the SK8 6374's from this company (many others have as well) at 12s no problems.

I have not used that exact power switch, but it appears rated for 12s. People in the Amazon reviews indicate it to be good as well for 12s builds.

Generally companies rate the products for "intended use case", and they can usually stretch a little bit past that point before breaking down. Depending on the company, and how solid of a product is will dictate how much they can really handle. For example elevators say "do not exceed 3000 lbs", but really they're capable of holding more than that.

As for how they rate them, it has become standard to use series configurations in multiples of 2, and doing them in odd increments is well, odd (less common).

Overall I think you should be just fine with these components and a 12s configuration.

Great, thanks! I'll report back if I blow anything up.

motors are absolutely fine with 12s but the antispark is hit and miss.  It looks like a luna and its from DIYE who are notorious for crap components, bad QA and sharing credit card details on a public domain but as you're not buying direct you should be ok.  The switch will break, its not an if its a when.  Just hope that it fails in the on position.  You'd be much better off making yourself an XT90s loopkey.  Lots of how to's on here and youtube.

this has likely nothing to do with safety margins and elevators ;)

lithium ion cells go from 2.5 to 4.2V approx.
so a 12S battery ranges between 30 and 50.4V approx.

manufacturers always print a single voltage on their products, not a range. this is called the nominal voltage and is usually between 3.6 and 3.75V.
in this case: 12cells x 3.75V nominal = 45V nominal.

a 10S lithium battery charger which charges up to 42V might sometimes also be labeled as just "37V", which can be quite misleading...

hope this helps

You'll be lucky if that switch lasts a week, I personally wouldn't run it over spec. 

I'd go ahead and put a loop key in line so that in case of a failer you can disconnect power.

I would have to agree with most the sentiments so far. That anti spark switch is not ideal. I had one on 10s setup. I maybe got 80kms total before a failure. Not worth good money IMO. @eLDoska has some pretty solid anti spark switches made quite well. Would recommend. ðŸ˜€

I'll add a loop as well just in case. Maybe I'll 3d print a cover for the loop key to make it look cool.
