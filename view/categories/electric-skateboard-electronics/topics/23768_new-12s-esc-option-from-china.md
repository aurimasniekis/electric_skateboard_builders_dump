The description is pretty basic. but so is the price! $40 for the single and $72 for the dual!
price does not include shipping, but still really cheap. i guess whats being used in some cheap boards?

ppm input, sensor input, small footprint.

tempted to grab one to try for a cheapy/mini build, anyone else?

Found it on Alibaba. Not sure if it's the factory or just a reseller. Also no info on programming.

But I'll ask. 
They also have vescs and stuff. So you it might be good. Have to get it and see I guess.

I was told they are sensored, and "no need for reprogramming "

If anyone wants to try let me know asap!
$40 now or $50 later. ðŸ˜‰
For the single version.
