I just have a quick question, because I am baffled by this. I have a 12 ah 12s4p battery pack, used to charge it with 2a charger and it took 20+ hours to get it to full charge ( the pack sat for a year almost fully charged so I thought that's the reason it takes so long)... Yesterday I bought a 4a charger and my battery got charged from 30 to 100 percent in around 60-70 minutes... That's not even physically possible, the Math here doesn't click... Does anyone have any ideas? I don't wanna burn down the house...  I went from 20 hours to 60 minutes by doubling my amperage...???

How are you measuring charge?

I have a regular battery indicator, shows %

Maybe your previous charger was not 2a? ðŸ¤”
For my 11s4p hg2 pack I needed about 70-80min for a full charge cycle with a 5a charger.

I mean 2a without losses will charge max of 2ah per hour... I thought so too... My old charger was bad... But how can a 4a charger charge 8+ ah in one hour... that just doesn't make sense

Check if your indicator can give you voltage instead.

What's even weirder is that the final balancing is up-to BMS, charger has no say here... (Before with my old charger even when I charged it to 100%, If I disconnected the charger and turned the battery on it would drop immediately to around 93, 94%.... Now after that 1 hour it charged to 100% and when I turn it on it already stays at 98%...  So the end result is my battery is charging insanely fast and my BMS is on steroids balancing about 10 times faster than it was in the past...

Wait, just that iâ€˜m sure I donâ€™t get something wrong.
So you have 4 12ah batteries in parallel?
Or is it a 12s4p pack out of 3ah cells?
For a 12s4p of 30q cells I think 1-1,5h for a full charge would be realistic.

12s4p, samsung 30q 3000mah... 2a charger will charge 2ah per hour and anywhere I look they say it charges less than that... That;s the fact I know and can't get around :) 8-9 ah in 60-80 minutes...?

My 12s4p would take 16 hours with a 2a charger cause it wasn't always charging at 2a it would vary depending on battery percentage so after 75% it would drop dramatacily and take for ever to finish. My 4a charger fully charges the same battery is 3.5 hours.

Wow, that doesn't explain how mine charges from 33 to 100 in 60-80 minutes but the difference between 2a and 4a is obviously so huge... Thought my charger must be broken... So it seems normal for 2a chargers to charge that freaking long...

If you have 12ah and get a full charge in 3,5 hours with a 4a charger seems exactly on the spot

I must do some tests... Drain it all the way down and then charge it cause I just can't get over the fact how the battery charge loaded up like a pc game

You would have to ride the board and monitor it to make sure nothing is out of the ordinary. See if the range was affected dramatically and check again after a recharge.

wait a minute, you let your battery fully charged laying around for a year? that is rly damaging to your battery, could be those batteries have suffered severe capacity lose...doenst sound rly safe.

I bought the board used and the guy told me that... He never rode it, only like twice... And thought keep oit at full charge is a good idea :)

i would suggest to just drive in a circle not too far away from you car or home, since i think you will have to push or carry it ^^
did you charge it fully from empty in under an hour?

I had 32% and charged it fully in max 80 min. That plug I have is for 5a max... If it charged with more a it would melt...

Yeah, true... But I can go for 60 km with it... And I ride every day... Two days ago I would wait for 20 hours, today I wait for 60 minutes... I am not complaining, just wanna make sure it's not some obvious case of "You are gonna burn down the house man"

We can use math! Let's say your battery is using 2500mAh cells. At 4P, that's 10,000mAh or 10Ah. If you charge at 4A, it will take 2.5h from completely empty to full (10Ah/4A=2.5h). In reality, it will be close to 3h with the charger switching from constant current to constant voltage when the battery is almost full.

You could have an issue with your battery. Iâ€™ve had bad cells cause batteries to charge/discharge quicker than normal.

This doesn't sound good to me, 1 hour for such a huge pack? With a 4A charger that should still be 3h at least. Are you sure your cells are well balanced because that could cause the charger to stop charging when 1 cell reaches 4,2V.

I got a 2A charger and the real charging current is 1.8A and current drops around 4V/ cell
For my 10S4P 30Q (11Ah real cap) it takes around 7h from empty to completely full

I would add this to see charging current:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-add-watthour-energy-meter-to-your-charger-tutorial/59255

Wattage changes by about 10% at least, based on what voltage your pack is at..

So yeh.. otherwise your pack might have lost capacity and now charges up faster

Pardon my ignorance... but the fact that this battery was left untouched for a year it means something, no? Side effects for the long time it sat there, what about memory effect? Is possible with this batteries? He mentioned after 100% charge, battery show 93% right away? isn't this degraded memory effect?

You can store liions that long even fully charged without major negative effects. The capacity will still be at around 80% compared to 96% at nominal voltage. Source: https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_store_batteries
 There is also no "memory effect" - that was before lithium batteries. 
It is obviously better to keep them at their nominal voltage but you make it sound like it's the most ridiculous thing in the world to have them fully charged.
