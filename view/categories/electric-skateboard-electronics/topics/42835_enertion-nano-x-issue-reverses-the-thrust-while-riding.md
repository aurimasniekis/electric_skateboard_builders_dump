I m using the enertion nano x remote and a Hobbywing ezrun max6,  while riding I was ejected as the thrust was reversed instantly. When getting up I notice the forward way is now full brake and brake makes it go forward!!! It is the second time it happens. Every time there was heavy rain around me.

It  is unacceptable , do you think it is the remote’s fault or the ESC?

The only thing I can think of is that you hit the throttle reverse button on the side of the remote. Especially if it happened while riding or just starting off. It's never happened to me and I think it's not easy to do. Also the parts are not waterproof. Perhaps @CarlCollins could shed some light.

HI Jerome 

I think you've accidentally enabled remote's Throttle Mirror Mode feature

I hope this helps.

Hi Carl, I find it strange that no where on the instructions you posted and no where on the website does it mention the throttle calibration. Shouldn't this be priority information about calibrating the throttle every time you turn it on? Maybe is has been updated since I bought my first one?

I believe is more related to this "Every time there was heavy rain around me"

Hi 

Information related to Nano-X was already on the Helpdesk from ages.
And yes you need to calibrate everyday before rolling.
Here is the link: https://enertionboards.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000077673-Nano-X

Raptor 2 riders get this information printed on the box when they receive the board.

There’s also a sticker on the remote telling you to calibrate it each time before use.

Carl, where’s my wheels!

I own 5 nano-x's. The only one that came with a sticker on it is the one that came with my Raptor 2.

I guess the sticker is a new thing. When did you get your remotes?

Thanks Carl, I picked up my nano x in one of the very first group buys. It arrived in December of 2016. I've know about the calibration issue since the beginning and was curious about the info. The link you posted doesn't/didn't  lead me to info about the calibration process which was my point. There is lots of other info there which is great. I love the product, don't get me wrong. It's why I have a second one on the way.

Hi Carl

What is the calibration operation to be done here? 
I don t see any instruction,  my remote does not have this sticker

I think my issue was due to either pressing involuntarily the mirror button or the rain activated this function for me

I ll ride with something around the remote to protect it next time

Hi Jerome 

Binding procedure is written in this image

Which I've shared with you earlier.

Carl that link does not provide info for the calibration procedure. It shows how to bind the product not calibrate the throttle. No where on that link does it give the procedure he asked you for. The qr code doesn't either. The update log is empty. My point is that the calibration info should also be shown in that link and it isn't. At the very least it should show up the in the empty update log.

Hi 

Actually, Binding is same as calibration, 
Because rest of the remote settings was configured by the ESC.

It seems binding is not the same as calibration.

Let me clarify 

The binding of Remote with Raptor 2 and DIY board is different. 
The sticker shows the binding with Raptor 2. The image describe the binding procedure with DIY board.

And to calibrate the nano x on a diy board is the same as the sticker? Is this what you should do very time you turn on the nano?

Is there anybody using the mirror button? I had some cases where I activated the function by accident so I removed the button.
Imo the most useless feature ever!

[/quote]

That’s what I do on my Nano x that I got last year. Remote on, full throttle for half a second, full brakes, then turn the board on. Same when u first set the ppm values for your master vesc.

If I don’t, the acceleration seems ok but brakes are not gradual and engage almost fully even when u pull the throttle back for 1mm. I have a sticker on the remote that says I should do this before turning the board on. I didn’t see the sticker first and wasn’t sure what I did wrong, then @Jinra pointed out I need to do it ever time.

Seems like a giant pita to have to do this everytime you turn it on! Is it just the nano x needs this?

Carl, The sticker shows the calibration process and the sheet/ link you provided shows how to bind. These remotes bind automatically. What they don't do is calibrate automatically. Point again is the calibration info being on a sticker is great, but it's not in the manual or in the update log using the qr code. 

The calibration procedure is the same whether on a raptor 2 and or a diy board. Most of us are using all the same components as a raptor 2. I am using two focbox's and a nano-x. I just would like you to look into updating the manual with the missing calibration info. You could do it in the update log. Otherwise it's nowhere to be found but on a sticker on the remote itself and the raptor 2 box.

This calibrationshown here is just to verify the remote is not reversed. And it sort of obvious as we would immediately catch such an issue at the start of the ride.  So we can t be injured by “not calibrating” 
But the whole world “calibrate “ their board then before a ride. The point is we all are aware if the throttle works at the start of the ride

My nano x randomly switches the forward throttle to brake. So I would just be cruising along, then I pull the throttle backward to slow down, then when I try to accelerate -- it brakes!!! Then it's back to normal again. I can't believe I waited 3 months for this remote to arrive. My old Winning remote is much safer than this.

You may be holding the button on the left side of the remote under the LED's. Hold it for a few seconds and it will reverse your input

I know what that button does. The issue is that it only switches the forward throttle to brake for a second then it's back to normal (i.e. forward throttle accelerates the board again).

I think there is an issue in that remote. The reverse functiom got activated randomly for me 2 times while riding this is extremely dangerous!!!!!!! Enertion sent me a  new remote.

Still I think the thumb course is too short and gives sudden accelerations , more felt on a high power setup

@barajabali sent me another nano x, but still has the same issue. I tested it today around the areas where my old Winning remote would simply cutoff for a sec and the nano x would still randomly brake (like fully brake) when I accelerate. I connected my Winning remote just to make sure that my board wasn't causing this and it worked just fine. 

If I wasn't aware of this issue, I probably would have face-planted a few times.

Try soldering your wires onto the receiver instead of plugging.

Hmm I don't have a nano x yet but I do run a Winning v2 remote and i love it, I hate the long throw on the Evolve r2 remote and the boosted I like the response from the shorter throw.

Think about it this way a Comfy Mecedez Benz will have soft brakes and accelerate smoothly for comfort but on contrast you have the BMW sports car with Harsh sensitive brakes and violent acceleration because its just better when doing their own thing. I don't cruise around on my board I like to ride it fast and hard so I want sports car controls not luxury car controls
