Hi, i'm currently designing my enclosure but I have yet to receive my battery from eskating.eu and i'm looking for measurements on the battery indicator, on/off switch and the charging port so i can plan out a bit better. Mostly looking for the depth of them so i know how wide to make the enclosure.

Appreciate the help :slight_smile:

As an cnc operator I have excellent eye measurement. The battery indicators is 25 mm high and the charge port is 18mm

Does your laser eyes tell you the depth of the battery indicator? ;)
