Hey guys, I was just looking through the BLDC tool and noticed the control settings in the bottom right hand corner. I'm working on a project where I have to launch a tennis ball and I'm using my ESK8 setup for it. It would be super helpful to be able to set it to run at a set RPM, but when I put in a value for RPM on the BLDC tool and click the button it doesn't seem to run anywhere near the number I enter.

Anyone have any experience with these settings?

EDIT: It seems like the RPM value is actually ERPM. Difficult to tell though.
