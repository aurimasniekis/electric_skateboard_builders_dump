Sooo maybe this post will serve to help someone avoid the same mistake i did.... but i kinda assumed that the mini remote would work with with like fs gr3e receiver, bc theyre both 2.4ghz 3 channel recievers. I bought 6 and tested on 2 dif remotes.. then i went ahead and bought bangoods receiver and its work on both remotes.
  ![20181110_171505|374x500](upload://mDvfVBKpzN7k2PITB1EQ1dCoXXy.jpeg) Left is fs, from amazon. Rt one is bangoods. Sooo as a side note if anyone needs some fs gr3e recievers for whatever lemme know lol.. or if anyone else had had luck pairing these ide love to hear how you did itXD
