Hi Guys,
so i have
motor - turnigy turnigy 5055 280kv
lipo - 6s
esc - quicrun obbywing QUICRUN-WP-8BL150 Waterproof 150A Brushless ESC For 1/8 RC Car Buggy

when i hit the remote - it only runs for 10seconds
im not sure that it is the cofiguration of the eSC (its configure as the default paramaters
check the video.... any idea ?

Looks like the wiiceiver is playing up.

Try using your arrow keys on the BLDC tool.
If doing so, does it run for longer?

Bldc tool is for the VESC.... But since ypu have another esc don't pay attention to it.

After looking a bit more at your video, it's looking more like a failure of your esc... but I don't really these esc...

Maybe this will, I think you need the esc before

Hi Johnny,

VESC . . . .
Or currently I'm using this one until I can buy a VESC: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbyking-120a-boat-esc-4a-ubec.html

Although the brakes aren't very good.

if it´s a esc issue get a well known one like the fvt 120a or the x-car beast 120a or 150a ( i´m riding one and this thing is really nice :)
