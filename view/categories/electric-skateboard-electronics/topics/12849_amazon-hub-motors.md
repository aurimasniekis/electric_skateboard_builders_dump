If you want cheap you get shit. 

Go for some New @Hummie's  or Carvon (if that's still a thing?)

It depends on what you want to do. Your weight, hill climbing needs and budget is. I would go for a cheap dual satellite configuration at 6s if on a tight budget.

a truck wheel combo costs ~50 off ebay. Hub motors are usually more trouble than they are worth if you cheap out on them. Hummie used to have $200 for two trucks 4 wheels and two aluminum hub motors, but now its a liittle late.
