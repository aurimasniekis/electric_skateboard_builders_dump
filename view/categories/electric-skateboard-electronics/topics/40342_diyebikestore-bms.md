Hi everyone, I am looking for a BMS with on/off switch for a longboard build. I was wondering if this [BMS](https://www.diyebikestore.com/60a-lithium-ion-7s-10s-13s-bleeding-bms30a-60awith-electronic-switch-bms-on-off_p0050.html) can be used for an electric longboard or does anyone have any experience with this BMS? I also heard that [Bestech BMS](http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html) are good but there is a 2 order minimum, which I wouldn't want to do since I only need one unless anyone have one for sale. Thank you.
