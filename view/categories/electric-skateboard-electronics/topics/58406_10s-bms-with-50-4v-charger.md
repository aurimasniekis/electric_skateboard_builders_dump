Since you use the bms for balance the charging fase. No you can't. You just need to buy another bms 12s charging only thar Ã¨ are really cheap out there.

Edit: 12s2p Liipn battery will sag a lot I believe. Maybe consider to buy few cells more and go for 10s3p. If you want more power maybe something in between like 11s3p. Then the bms is ok for 10s but not the charger. Some charger you can change the Vol by open the case and thereis a voltage regulator inside that you modulate, although it allows small changes of plus minus 5V so probably won't be possible.
