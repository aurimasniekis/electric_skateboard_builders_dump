Hey guys! Since a while I decided to develop a bit in the remote section and endet up with the FEATHER REMOTE.

![fe978d38-dd0e-4e3c-9dea-d0ea91fb4ec0|690x330](upload://yqSYE0Wb9AJfawsskhPqZNQZXs5.jpeg) 

As @DroidSector decided to go with the TOGO board, I ll stay on the FEATHER M0 RFM69. Two different ways... I think its great, it gives the community more choices and everyone can use the remote with his own preferences.

I put a lot of work onto the code and now can say its stable enough for daily rides. I used the remote now for month and had NEVER any problem with it. I programmed a lot of DEBUG code on the remote to check the connection while riding and I am happy with the results. I never had any issues with the remote from interferences... not down town, not at places with thousands of peoples...

I focused a lot on the safety and stability features... special the ESTOP feature on lost connections (I never had one, but u can try it while switching off the remote while riding...) worked awesome. 
I am also very happy with the "encryption key" handling. Works super smooth and its super safe.

I also tried the different GUI from @DroidSector. It looks super cool, but I think its not that perfect for such a small screen... I ll stay on my clunky big numbers screen. Also because I am not good in designing good looking screen :slight_smile:  

Here are some features:

- 0.96inch OLED with 128x64 with high frequently display update rate to have smooth and accurate informations (every 60ms)
- join settings menu with 5 seconds press on extra button or hold trigger on start up
- trigger can be used as DEADMAN-Switch or CUISE-Control
- vibration feature (Alarm on low battery from Board, Remote battery...)
- extra button to switch between 3 different main Screens 
  - Speed, Distance, Voltage
  - Voltage, Motor amps, Battery amps
  - DEBUG RSSI, cycle time, failed transmissions
- headlight integration by pushing the extra button for 2 seconds
- over 16 updates per seconds from throttle position to PWM output (every 60ms)
- pair up to 200 boards with unique ID
  - one remote will handle all boards by selection the board ID from settings menu

Safety Features:

- automatic generated 16 bytes encryption key (15 bytes for unique key and 16th byte for board selection)
  - after first tun on from remote, it will generate a random 15 byte key
  - every new receiver can be paired from settings menu with the new key and board ID (after first connect, u have to switch on and off the board to acknowledge the new pairing)
- ESTOP automatic slow down until stop - more than 450ms no new values from remote will force the receiver into ESTOPMODE and slow down the trigger value every 50ms by 2/4 (soft/hard) until it reaches 25% break trigger to stop the board safe
  - ESTOP will armed automatically after first valid transmission between remote and receiver
- priority transmission handling! Deactivating display refresh and UART pull if no valid transmission is received until
  - ESTOPMODE is triggered, then display is refreshing again for analysing error
- break light integration with adaptive flash warning
  - if trigger is under middle position the break light will be bright 
  - if trigger is close to full break position the break light will flash
- different riding modes for beginners | intermediate | pros
  - trigger value will be attached to 50% | 75% | 100%
- police mode
  - Trigger value will be cut of at 25%, can be unlocked with button press combination

Here are some pictures of the current status:
The PCB for a nice clean build with JST-PH connections (I ll replace them in the next order with JST-ZH plugs)

![IMG_7160|375x500](upload://capqJuKXvE9rNAz4yCNopGcRYid.jpeg) 


The remote also got some bearings inside for a smoother run. I am not a big fan of the plastic slide style...

FeatherRemoteAdvanced Receiver V0.1:
![FeatherReceiverAdvancedWiring|690x365](upload://hCalRIsiAjp1BQsZr1rJt04YdRQ.png) 


Side project...
--------------------------------
I am also working on an super super small SMD PCB to convert every remote to an SMART remote. And yes... its fucking small... 25x32mm with JST connection for all u need... close to finish, but need some testing of course :wink:

![48|570x500](upload://k9RGEWNZfwSuQ2iDOMlnI1HTsgZ.png)

So I u have any ideas or suggestions, please let me know. I ll sell one two or three remotes with receivers before I ll release anything to make sure everything works perfect. Its special interesting for people who riding more then one board frequently and want to use the same remote all the time.

Keep calm and eat :hamburger:

If you need any beta testers to give one some abuse, I generally find a way to ride that breaks most stuff.

last week I was at Stefan's house and I tested the remote in person. I can confirm that it has a very good ergo-fit, better than the Firefly as it is smaller. What I liked the most is the debug feature, it's the only remote I know that tells you if there where any connection problems. The ball bearings make it also super smooth. 

I'm definitely gonna use it in my personal HAYA board. Super stoked to mount it as soon as my board arrives :D

@bevilacqua Aye man! I am looking forward to to place the new receiver PCB into our beautiful deck! And of course I ll order one from u :sweat_smile: take my money :hugs:

@Grolletje there will be some components not he receiver PCB to take care of this. The code is already done and working nicely. I tested it on breadboard with some small LEDs. The total power of headlight and backlight is 36W. Should be enough for a bright night!  
The PCB is also here, but I am still missing some components. On the board is an 42V to 12V regulator capable of 3A current. U can connect parallel to your VESC over screw terminals and drains directly from the battery... 

There will be an "easy" board available with no features except of capacitors and a reset button to reset the address (and of course the JST connector!) and an advanced board with the 12V regulator, headlight, breaklight and buzzer
![IMG_7172|666x500](upload://584nxPJCCJSDBt0CbYdGw04FK9t.jpeg) .

@dougpage I live in Germany, the only country in the entire world where rules existing for small electric vehicles :smile:  

@Silverline yes, I think there will be an diy kit available. BUT I ll send the FEATHER M0 precoded. I don't want to free the code for now. Maybe in the future. 

@all I ll go on with the finish developing this week. I ordert some FEATHERS and will choose 3 testers of the end of the week.  1 in US and 2 in Europe. The price will be 100euro for a set (including everything!). U ll get the money back if u think the thing is shit and u don't like it.

@briman05 no, i don't need a bluetooth module...  just connect the the JST 5 pin plug to your VESC and go for it.

The settings will be changed at the remote itself in a simple settings menu and the remote will transmit the settings to the receiver via the build in RFM69 module.

Would you consider releasing only the case files? I think most of the firefly components would fit, already have all of them, but didn‚Äôt found the ergonomics to be perfect (too long)

@totalgeek9224  Yes this will be the price for the betas. The later version will be a bit more expensive.

@Pedrodemio yes I can do this... but at the moment I don't have a nice solutions for the ONOFF switch, so there is a little hole on the back. I ll upload them tonight.

@moone @Friskies  that sounds awesome! At the end of the week I ll decide how many beta testers I ll run. maybe there will be two slots for Australia

If you have haptic for low voltage, can you add for high voltage? It'll be good for those with charge only bms.

@deucesdown  Ok, i ll think about this in the next steps... :slight_smile:

@MrCheatak jeah! Thats what i want. A super smooth stable remote that works all the time and makes my life easyer!

@murdomeek should be a very easy function to include... this feature will also be avaible for betas.

Unfortunitly is lost a bit of code from the last days. I screwed up something by handling the data... :( But its not that bad. I ll give u an update later in the evening!

Thanks guys! U keeping me motivated!!

Sorry not at the moment... i still got no good place for the ON/OFF switch. I tried to use the DEEP SLEEP mode of the Feather, but it still draws to much current. I think a ON/OFF swtich is needed.

Time for updates!

I got a little setback yesterday, because I lost o lot of data, but I could recode everything...

- ESTOP feature improved / I got some new feature in this function. (Board slows down until -25% throttle until the board stops, tested on full speed... works just great!)
  - added a setup possibility to adjust this feature in three different stages. U can choose between SLOW, HARD and OFF. Nice for people who don't wanna use this function or make it more strong.
  - RECOVER from eStop is simplified! Before u had to switch on and off the board. Now you just can recover by bring back a stable connection for 1 Second and the board can (I count the transmissions within one second and jump into normal mode if a certain amount of transmissions are done in this second!). This is perfect if u just leave u board somewhere outside and went in for a coffee or something. Go out of the shop, grab your board and the board run as before!
  - added a little shield icon to the main screen to always knows that the ESTOP mode is working and the board is safely connected

- Center Death Zone added
  - I added a adjustable area where the trigger will be ignored in the center. Can be adjusted in the settings menu as well

- Riding modes
  - I implemented a simple "Beginner", "Intermediate" and "Pro" mode where the remote calculates independent trigger to throttle output mappings. Means in "beginner" mode u can use the HOLE throttle movement but max trigger will only be converted in an 75%isch throttle... on "Pro" mode it will use a 100% throttle output as normal

- Improved encryption key handling... now it works super smooth to pair a new board! Even switching between different boards is easy as f&&k. Its the first option in the settings menu.

- I changed the trigger to an bigger tactile switch, gives it a nice clicky and stronger feedback!

- still waiting for new ON/OFF switches. I think I got a nice solution for this. Direct solders to the PCB.

- I ll order some new PCBs with slightly improvements... the old ones are still very good! I will start some builds if my Feathers are arriving. Should be within the next days!

And sorry for my excellent englisch :sweat_smile: I try my best!

BOOOOYSCH i am exited!

@StefanMe how does the ESTOP behaves if you are applying full throttle or full brake? I have something similar coded in my remote but for now I have to turn on and off the board since I couldn‚Äôt find a safe way to resume the command, abruptly doing it can throw you off

I have a complex handling with the estop. Took me a while to get this done. 

Depend on settings u have chosen in the settings menu, the board will slow down completely until the break is at -25% throttle. I slow down a virtual throttle and check some internal things... then I make connection checks between remote and receiver and verify the values that are coming in are "safe" within a specified time for a few time. At this time the board is standing still. Then u can throttle again... IF ur are in "soft" mode. If u are in "hard" mode u have to recover with full throttle back for a while. Sounds much easier than it is... u also have to capture some other things like parts where u are not transmitting data... if u are in the menu... but still want the board not go into estop mode ect.

Thats how I do it on the "soft" mode... its more complex, but that's the main idea.

My first version was the same like yours. But it sucks when u are just a few meters away from the board and the board goes into estop, u have to switch on off again.. Blabla... sucks.

```
Can the throttle be reversed, so away-from-body is brake and towards-body is throttle?

Those of us using trigger remotes can't really even try things like this without that feature

It'd be like borrowing your spouse's car except the throttle and brake pedals are on opposite sides from yours ... then a car pulls out in front of you ... and you instinctively mash the throttle.... despite being in full control the entire time up to that point when your reflexes activated

Theres no good reason, why these parts can't be built into a 3d printed trigger style remote. Someone just needs to model it.

Looks great, didn't realize it would be so high priced. Is the set down for 10s only?

If so, I might just get a basic and call it a day. I have done the tail lights using arduinos before and it works well. Just take in the pwm and if past a certain value, make the lights brighter. And once it falls down below a certain value, the light dim again. Pretty simple code.

No problem guys! U are in the first batch where is a little bit space for changes.

Looks like i can upgrade some parts for 12s. I have to change at least the diode and one capacitor. I try to organize a board with 12s to test it. I run only on 10s, But i look optimistic!

Aswell as blinker integration like the [Photon Remote](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/photon-addressable-leds/74309/10?u=totalgeek9224).

I know this is gen 1, but i think these would be welcome improvements for the next gen

Just a quick update and explanation of the main page:

Here u find on the top left the throttle indicator. Next to it the long bar for the board battery indicator. On the right side the main values (there will be 3 different pages available... at the moment u see voltage, motor amps, battery amps) and on the bottom system indicators like remote battery, headlight status and the ESTOP status.

Ok, we can try it with just internal one. If I have connection problems I can add the lanyard by your own...
 U can also simply let hang out the antenna how I do it at the moment.

Perfect! I will try, anyway I have a plan to make a compressed fiber glass lid.
I got a question, I build in the past the firefly remote and I did like it a lot, but I find very long the travel the thumb wheel, is your model similar travel? It can be adjusted? 
And the firefly has two thumb wheels, round, or with nipple, is the same with yours? Anyway no problem I can get rid of the nipple with a file or cutter.

Fiberglas lid... I would love to have one of these >D 

I have a nib on the feather remote... but I ll release the STL files today and anyway...  u can make your own thumb wheel if u want. 

The long travel is more a feature... u have more way to control the power of your board... specialy high power boards can be controlled a lot easier. BUT of course... if u want a short travel there should be a way. I can also realise the step files for the wheel and u can customise the mechanical part on top for your preferences!

Yesterday I tested the additional feature police mode here in Germany üòÇüòÇüòÇ it worked out... the police man said i should rather drive away then showing him this ultra slow mode üòÇ

Ahm I haven't read much of this topic, but I just saw that you using 12V voltage regulator probably something like  LM2576 and you will be connecting like lamps and loads more than 0.5A you will definitely will need radiator because those fckers heat up as their efficiency is pretty low like 75% so converting 42V to 12V 3A will be like around 10W of heat produced or etc.

Also, LM2576 has an HV version which has a higher input voltage (60V) than its normal version (40V) so it would work with up to 13S batteries :)

But anyway looks like good design and cool looking remote, it is nice to see innovation happening in remotes section :)

@Kug3lis  
I checked this before, and they didnt heat up that  much... thats strange. I ll check this again. Thanks for the advise. 
I already use the HV version :) thats not the problem. But other components like capacitors and diods are the bottleneck. I upgraded them already.

I like your work! Unfortunitly i missed your black friday thing.

@sofu looks like i ll ship all remotes with batteries. Makes no sense becuase of one or two days to split them

502535
[/quote]

Little lipos tend to degrade in time faster than liions. Also most diy folks out there have some spare 18650 laying around and you can keep one battery charged at all times in case you need quick replacement. This is ofcourse with the idea of taking the battery out if needed. If you look at the electronic cigaret boxes then you can see how small they can be made :slight_smile: 
You can share the .step files. I might have a look into this.

its cool if u build in like a software OFF for the remote. because u can switch off the remote into a standby mode, where the remote just needs a few mA. 

I build this into the remote for an power safe mode. If the remote is not connected to a board for more then 10/30 minutes, it switches off to safe battery... in case u forgot to switch it off. Then its cool u still have power after a week or something.

I go to the shipping office in our company this evening and ask them again... I also want tracking numbers, because of the expensive parts üòÇ 

I also send u all some spare springs, if the tension from the spring inside is to strong, u can simply exchange the spring...

I made a quick hardware test with all remotes! Includes also the connection to receiver. The connection was good on all remotes! This should not be a problem :slight_smile:

I read a lot about the photon remote... its a very nice remote, but the people have some big issues with it unfortunately. And the guy who build this remote is nearly lost in space and didn't response since weeks. Hopefully he is fine, because building this remotes while u have other pressure from work or whatever can kill u.

Some picture? I ll find some... :) forgot about this!

just send it back, im sure Stefan will send you the correcto one. Mistakes can happen. I've seen you complain way too much... This is not a product you buy from a normal vendor, it is still in developement and all the work is done by one guy: Software, Hardware, 3d Printing etc etc. Thats a ton of work that just consumes a lot of time

My point is that clearly it was an innocent mistake. He sent you a product with a higher value than what you ordered: he lost money as it is, and perhaps even has someone with the wrong receiver- someone who paid for something more, and received less. Perhaps there's a language barrier, but as @[bevilacqua](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/bevilacqua) said, Stefan is working hard on these and is a one-man team. 
Just next time instead of "Dammit! U sent me the wrong one:-( / I ordered the basic version because i have 0 space in my enclosure man. This is never gonna fit" it could be "Hey man, it seems that you might've sent me the wrong unit, could you get in touch? Thanks"

I really wish i had the space to fit it in i really do. But just not gonna work. The remote looks and feels amazing very impressed did a great job!.
And the soldering on the reciever is really good.

Just received mine, omg!! It's really nice ergo feeling! Thumb wheel and killswitch are really pleasant to play with, and the 3d print is really good, mad props for your printing skills bud.
Just couple questions Stefan, don't know why but I can't get rid off the estop, I disable but still in there activated, I tried well, no luck.
Something to improve, the antenna on the Rx didn't last more than 5 minutes, just fell down.
Just quick silicone wire soldering and up & running again.
I'm waiting for your write up about the connections on esc side.

@Surfer 
Strange... can u try something for me? Just go into settings menu and make all the changes u need (estop, wheel size, throttle ect...) then before u leave the settings menu, switch off the receiver, then switch off the remote. The power on again everything. Does it work now?

Thanks for the advice of the receiver antenna wire... maybe a big drop of hot glue on the solder joint to make the connection more rigid?
```

It did not make any difference, all other settings I can change them without any problem, with the regular procedure. ( Is not a problem for me most probably is a nice feature )
About the antenna, the hot glue for sure will help, but I think also better to use a wire with more copper inside.

No that doesn‚Äôt make a difference, the amount (thickness) of the cooper inside makes no difference in signal strength... the length of the wire is very important! In EU versions it must
be 15-16cm! In US and AUSTRALIEN it Mist
Be 7.5‚Äì8cm

The best wire u can use is a solid wire... but it‚Äôs not worth it. I tested it. If u push the menu button, u can cycle to the CONNECTION page. The big value there is the RSSI. The higher the value, the better the connection (starts at -30, critical under -70) keep in mind -30 is higher than -40 ;)

Ok, I ll check this tomorrow...! MAYBE it‚Äôs just an visual problem... 

I am not shure that tue message on the remote (E-Stop armed and estop actrivated) is connected to the settings. I ll explain it tomorrow in more detail.

Are you referring to the diagram on the instructions? Could you elaborate as i believe it is a descriptive as possible in regards to the pinout of the reciever. 
Furthermore, what VESC do you have? Maybe we can give some specifics for your case :)

And the pwm is that the white wire from the ppm signal wires i need to use and the other 4 are the uart port as shown here ?![15456619808408717218199525473644|281x500](upload://1Wf9ks0KQ4cnnk2tsgEST0N4j74.jpeg)

U can use the same Cable for the small and the big receiver... lineup in the plug is the same. But the plug has an orientation. normal on small receiver, 180 degrees on big receiver.

The wires have colours which I hope you should be able to trust to what they are.

My bad. It makes way more sense to what you were saying but still they have a certain colour order on the plug. 

Which is:
orange 
yellow
white
red

This usually translates to:

orange rx
yellow tx
white ppm
red 5v
black ground

Can I get a confirmed on that?

Whenever the remote is paired i try to change settings so i go into the settings amd the remote vibrates and unpairs and i need to repair it to the board. Cant seem to get it working correctly 
Still waiting for the reciver basic one so hoping it will come tomorrow fingers crossed.
No matter what setting i try to change it say communication failed and nothing changes apart from its not paired anymore and i need to re do that process over amd over again.

Hey hey brotha, quick couple of questions for you....

I am super new to doing electronic stuff myself, soldering, etc, so please pardon my noob question when it comes to setting the remote up. Got it today though and couldn't be more stoked! Super nice looking and great feeling so can't wait to be using it.

I just started going through the guide you made and was just curious..... am I able to plug the receiver (I got the basic) right into my focbox and then pair it and I'm good to go?

Or what all do I need to do in order to hook this up to my VESC?

What are the extra couple parts you included for just to be certain?

Let me know when you can, hoping to get this set up and go for a ride in the next 30 mins or so if possible.

THanks again so much for your hard work Stefan!
```

## \#359 Posted by: totalgeek9224 Posted at: 2018-12-27T01:09:37.236Z Reads: 159

I think i may be able to answer some of these questions for you!
1. The only settings that (may) need to be changed for complete functionality on the VESC side are the following 3 things:
 Ensure that the Baud Rate for UART connection is 115200
 Use only CURRENT WITH BREAK, WITHOUT REVERSE
 Set the Control mode to PPM
Furthermore, when connecting to the focbox, know that you're not connecting the ppm cable that comes from the focbox directly into the receiver, but rather using the cable (that I believe is included, this is explained a bit further up and in the instructions in regards to how it's wired)
2. The extra parts that you speak of, I know of only the extra spring, which is used to increase/decrease the "tension" of the thumbwheel to your taste.

Hope that helps!

I guess he mean ‚Äúwatt mode‚Äù. Watt should be also ok... u can give it a try... but be carefull. I never tested it with watt mode. Important
Is, that u use a mode with break and no reverse!

There is a spring to change the tensions if Au don‚Äôt like the build in one as @totalgeek9224 mentioned correctly ... a cable to connect to the vesc and very tiny LC-Filter if u have problems with the power supply to the receiver... it helps u if u have freezes or something on the receiver.

Ok, got those couple things and just read through the guide you did. I didn't see anything about how the cruise control works, am I missing something or is it as simple as click the trigger switch when I want it to lock in at a certain speed.

I'm just curious though, why are the fets sticking up on one side like that?Is it just space constraints?

Also @StefanMe is it possible to get more advanced receivers if I wanted them :smiley:

I think its because there could be a pico speaker behind them, which wouldnt allow for them to be folded back
Furthermore, standing up they have some room to "breath" given that they have nothing to conduct their heat to even if they were folded down. 
If youre feeling risky, i believe its safe to trim the top tabs down using something like a dremel but that **is completely at your own risk**

Update.
Basic rx is in my enclosure and all is perfect 
Remote feels damn solid and works fantastic!!
Really does.
Only thing i could wished for is a small bizzer inside the remote that could work on the trigger as an option for bycycles infront of me as a warning.
That would be the cherry on top for me.
Really did good man with this first batch
High five for the effort dude

I have the cruise control on the trigger amd it works perfectly!
Warning vibrations work great too one thing i did not think of and this might be a good thing to think about.
I ride with left foot front 
And i ride with remote in my left hand.
So my palm covers the screen.
Did not even think about it but maybe an ootion to think of in the next batch mate

@tricky-fpv  Haha I am sorry... of course its a right hand version. Great that everything works. Give us feedback after a few rides what we can improve. 

I also thought about a horn or something, but then we need another button for this... like a splitted trigger... maybe in the future.

@Surfer yes it is :slight_smile:

@Jansen yes its just like that... go for a certain speed on the board and then hold the trigger at the throttle position as u want. The Trigger will lock the trigger position simulated at this point. If u break with the throttle or release the trigger, the cruise will cancel.

U just have to hook up your wiring like in the description manual. Set the Baudrate to 115200 in VESC and learn the new PPM signal like u did on your last remote.   

@sofu yes the its just to safe a little bit of footprint from the PCB. U can cut way the top of the metal part from the fets so safe some height. They are rated for a million amps or something. They will not get warm anyway. 

please before u put everything into place, try the lights and the breaks ect. outside of your board. Just to make sure there is no problem with heat from the step-down as someone before mentioned... I just use some of these LEDs Nichia NSDW570GS-K1 (5x)... its fucking awesome... just great to ride in the city. Of course nothing if u need a real front light. Maybe its better to go for 24v... Let me know your thoughts!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp5KQ5WFtwQ

here are the risers I created... perfect for TB218 with huge wheels.

I got some PCBs left here, but it think its more clever to rework the PCB because of the size and features. I ll remove the buzzer (I guess I ll not use it) and add a third channel for a horn or whatever.

I also want to replace the huge mosfets at least for the break lights and set them to 800mA max. Its not necessary to use that huge mosfet for backlights.

3xLED NSDW570GS = 10.2V with 70mA plus the series resistor of 25Ohm.

If u use the remote with an VESC, it will use the distance from the Vesc to recognise how far u traveled... or do u mean a odometer sensor like in phones?

Battery percentage is already implemented. On the "SPEED" page, the second value is the battery percentage from the board and on all pages is a long bar going from top to bottom to indicate the battery status.

Also just to clarify, you mean 12v is the max voltage for the led? Or do you mean anything below 12v?

Ah ok. Thanks

U have a 12V output on the two terminals on the Advanced PCB. U can connect here everything u want. If u have a LED with 12 volt, its just fine. But normally there are only LED with 3,4Volt or something and u have to put them in serials including a series resistor. Every motorbike break light for example will work.  because they managed the LEDs already to fit to 12V.

Is it still the same link? If so it would be great to get documented input/output power specs! For example I think earlier on I remember @StefanMe saying something about the power input for lights being good for 60v but on the pcb it's labeled 36V, so is that still the case? The output's 12V limit and amperage limits per GPIO11/12 should also be documented I think... Otherwise great writeup!

Not at the moment... still to much work with the first batch. But I ll let you know if there are some plans to create a second batch.

@sofu
At the moment its just rated for 10S. I don't have a 12S battery to try out how good it works with 12S. The only problem are the capacitor close to the input terminal and the huge diode on the bottom right edge. IT SHOULD WORK, but if u want to make sure u don't break anything, we should replace them to even bigger ones. 

The capacitor should be replaced with an even bigger [100uF 63V capacitor](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313.TR1.TRC0.A0.H0.X100uF+63V.TRS0&_nkw=100uF+63V&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_osacat=0&_odkw=MBR360) and the Diode should be replaced with [MBR360](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=MBR360&_sacat=0)

I rate the outputs GPIO11 GPIO12 for 2A total. More Is possible but not recommenced.

We ll update the instructions from time to time to give u as much help as we can.

I could recommend this one... https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/panasonic-electronic-components/ECA-1JM101B/P19536TB-ND/2688731

This one has a smaller diameter. But with a little bit of pushing the 10mm from you should also be ok. its just a space problem. But normally every 63V 100uF capacitor should work, as far as u can fit it in. 

The diode is just perfect. I am more conserved about the diode to be true. This is the much more important part to exchange. But I still recommend to to exchange both. 

I ll write a small section in the manual about upgrading the receiver to 12S.

Oh yeah excluding the adafruit module from the BOM would decrease the price and allow you to do things better like add low pass filter after the step-up converter so RF module/IC gets better.
Also pls use type-c port...

Where's the BOM of all the parts?
Can't find in the manual nor first post...

Next step is to bring the SAMD21 Chip as standalone onto the PCB
[/quote]

I have been considering doing this, it seems like the best option. 
I have been working in KiCad and it alows eagle import. adafruit release all of their design files in eagle format so getting the entire feather design onto your own board is quite an easy task.

also is there any reason that your using the SAMD21 not the 32u4? just wondering if there is a reason other than processor speed?

For now I just stick on the feather and want to make this a stable product. Then I go for the next step. But my plans already changed about the chip... I want to use the ESP32. Two cores are just awesome. One just for telemetry and the other for all the display handling ect. AND SUPER CHEAP.

This is because I didn't knew what's reasonable to show on this page...

Top: VOLTAGE,
Middle: MOSFET-Temp
Bottom: MOTOR-Temp

On the unity its more clear...

Top: MOSFET-Temp left,
Middle: MOSFET-Temp right
Middle-bottom: MOTOR-Temp left
Bottom: MOTOR-Temp right

I maybe should choose new names for the pages. I think there is no chance to get the second motor temp on the over bus ESCs. On the unity the pages shoes nearly everything... maybe @sofu can make a picture when she has done the

Haha nice idea... did u manually changed the filament on the third layer? Good idea... have not done this since a few!

Nice print quality!

Working on the remote and normal work. Unfortunately I am sick... so everything is bit harder at the moment! But everything is going well!

Just welder like two meters of black filament to a spool of white filament.
With one hand hold both filaments, with other hand use a lighter and melt both ends, then quickly join them.
When it's still elastic you hold it straight until it cools down, then you use sharp wire cutters to trim the excess off and at the end you finish the joint clean with a knife.

One thing I have to figure out how to get the filament lengt for the first X layers so I don't have to guess.
I had to guess here and as a result front has 3 layers of black and bottom 4 layers.

Thanks, but have to somehow make that stupid Cura slicer not poop random strings when traveling, it almost always destroys the look of the first layer.
Thought it might to do with poor retraction because of crappy bowden tube but when got better one(tighter one) it was getting clogged in the bowden near the heater.
Preferebly will have to get a printer with direct feed, no bowden tube(don't remember how it was called).

Well then get well soon, I have many questions to bother you with and also looking forward to that PCB that doesn't need adafruit module :stuck_out_tongue:

This is because u don't make retractions if u don't go over open spaces. So u loose hot filament while traveling from the outline to the "inner outlines" from the OLED. Travel faster with a faster acceleration will help... OR u go for [KLIPPER Firmware](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper) and activate the PRESSURE ADVANCED. This will keep the filament at the right place, doesn't matter where the nozzle is traveling ect. U also have just 1mm retraction on poor Bowden tubes. 

 Why so complicated? Just pause the print where u want to change the color, exchange the filament, and resume the print... super easy. No fusing, no calculation...
```

Will try to experiment with settings but not sure which option to change in Cura.
If I stop it, printer just freeze in the spot, doesn't retract and some filament gets out and destroys the print also because it's not moving it welds or even destroys the build plate.
```

Cure is just a slicer... the Firmware on the Board in the printer makes the STOP/START/RESUME ect... I guess u are using MARLIN, so check here the PAUSE functions and specially the PAUSE MARCO.

Means, if u press PAUSE on the printer, the FIRMWARE will execute a macro after stopping the print... for example:

Small retract, Raise Z, move printing head to parking position. (These macros I have for KLIPPER, not for MARLIN... they should work there also...)

    [gcode_macro pause]
    gcode:
    	 G90 // absolute
         G92 E0 // set extruder to 0
    	 G1 E-1 F6000 // small retract
    	 G91 // incremental
    	 G1 Z0.2 F200 // move z a little bit
    	 G90 // absolute 
    	 G1 X260 Y220 F12000 // move to parking pos
    	 
    [gcode_macro resume]

    	 G91
    	 G1 Z-0.2 F200

I talked to some developers in the last days and came to the conclusion, that it would be great to make it open source.

I am not a professional programmer and here are some awesome guys who can bring this remote to the next level with nicer menus ect.

U need to be able to handle SMD soldering and 3d-printing.

I never did this kind of software development but I work in tech and I know C. Hopefully I can contribute in the future.

With the files you provided am I able to get a PCB made for the transmitter and receiver? If not, is it possible to build this without any custom PCBs like Firefly Nano?

If anybody's looking to build this remote, keep in mind like @Arek said to keep the soldered pins as flush to the pcb as possible. Otherwise you the pin will puncture the battery and glitch everything mid ride...

Also I first trimmed them (with a flush wire cutter) and THEN soldered it, as a result sharp pins are covered with rounded solder.
As a another layer of protection I will add a layer of that fish paper that is intended for battery isolation use.

Those mounting holes on the bottom seem kinda broken, way too close to the PCB, manufacturer may complain.
Did you add a low pass filter for the RF module?
Pls put there USB type-c, it's time to switch from micro :stuck_out_tongue:
Have you used a bit bigger holes for the connectors?
I see all tracks the same width, power lines should be a bit thicker.
Also would be nice to have a SMD antenna.
That USB connector has two big pads, slap 4 tiny vias on each so it will be stronger.
You decided to keep THT hall sensor?
Thought you going for SMD one...
You added 3rd mounting hole, thanks!

Easy for JLCPCB :stuck_out_tongue: They will tell me this on the review.

Do u have any document showing its recomented`? I think there is already one on the most RF69 moduls. Any suggestions about inductions and capacty?

> Have you used a bit bigger holes for the connectors?

No, i tested them on my original JST connectors and they are just fine.

Look closer, they are already thicker

I ll think about it... maybe a pcb antenna...

I'm working on an accessible adaptation of this remote that does not use a 3-D printer... and proto-shields instead of custom PCB :) I found a very well-made hall-sensored, thumb-wheel that I'm going to try out. For a little extra money I can get a dual-sensored version. The additional hall-sensor is a safety redundancy feature. It requires an different power source and signal input on the feather. Could anybody give advice about adjusting the code to accommodate the second hall sensor. There would have to be some kind of signal to indicate that one of the sensors is not working as well. God forbid anybody would be riding around thinking that they have two sensors when, in fact, they only have one:)

The initial wiring problem is pretty big. There isn‚Äôt a secondary power source. There are plenty of inputs. The ground is common. Just no second power source.. I think. Here is a link to the switch if you or anyone else is interested [https://ruffycontrols.com/msa-series/](https://ruffycontrols.com/msa-series/)
They are used in military and aerospace applications. Accuation and spring force can be customized.

Might be working but you still have the wrong antenna.
You shouldn't really use 2.4GHz antenna on a 0.915GHz transmitter.
Search for 915MHz antenna.
I myself put just a piece of wire calculated for my frequency (433) at 1/4 of the wavelength, don't remember but I think it was 16cm, works well 10 meters of range through few walls (in house test).
But still haven't tested it in a real case scenario (esk8) as I'm still waiting for unity...

Yeah, I realized that when I was reading about it last night.

I don't need 10 meters of range though. Stefan made a good point about having a longer range in pm when we were trying to figure the connection out. You would want your remote to activate estop right away in a shorter distance from you just in case it malfunctions so you don't get a runaway skateboard.

Thanks for the heads up.

Just buy some antenna suited for your freq.

Can also try to change the orientation.
Also if you can go for lower freq. it gets through solid objects better just like sound.

I'm fairly certain there's some issue with interference that isn't being seen here. I have the same remote and @Touch415 and I ride together almost every weekend. I got my remote a couple months before he did and I also have the same issues as him. It will start cutting out around certain areas of town but the dbm remains below 60. We're in SF so I can highlight some places where Feather with transmitter and receiver antennas has gotten cutouts but my Firefly based remote with no antenna hasn't:

- Chinatown
- Twin Peaks around the tower
- Embarcadero and Broadway

Would love to see this fixed or figured out, it's a bit annoying :P

[quote="totalgeek9224, post:686, topic:74084"]

The RFM modules are specified for 433Mhz or 868-915Mhz.

@sofu if u find some time, please make some tests... go for 915 with a double lenght antenna. Normaly u use a LAMDA 1/4 Anntenna lenght: ~7,8mm. We Can try to use a LAMDA 1/2 Antenna lenght (stick more out of the remote ect.) with ~15.6mm.

If this doesnt helpt We can try the 868Mhz... EDIT: It looks like this is not allowed in US without an HAM amateuer licence. We could still try it out... 

Both should be valid in US. I ll check this later. 433Mhz is not very good with your RFM Module.

If u really want to make it as best as possible, make the antenna longer and place it on a table a few meters away from the board... then start to cut mm for mm the antenna lenght until u find the lowest dBm. Then do the same on the receiver.

Ofcourse!
When you download the Transmitter (remote) code, and load it into the Arduino IDE, the first few lines that you will see are ![09|519x500](upload://6QH18zqwgMaYPOBql1Pk81nle6S.png) 

all you have to do is change it to 

![23|519x500](upload://kOmoj2Nl7n2KVLcuAlatwFH1GFH.png) 

where you've removed the // in front of the #define ESC_UNITY and instead put the // to the ESC_VESC

During the feather board programming, the telemetry has to be setup for either VESC or Unity. It‚Äôs possible yours is on VESC, I‚Äôm not sure what @StefanMe defaults them to. 
It‚Äôs pretty easy to flash it again though, the manual is pretty detailed.

Might not have been soldered correctly(dry joint), this package is hard to solder and only proper reflow would do that properly.
But I would prefereably use tantalum capacitors, two 220uF would do the trick as a replacement for that 1000uF electrolytic that fell off, you don't need that much filtering just for a LED regulator.

I actually just put my receiver into a heatshrink tube that is intended for wrapping 18650 cells, should keep that capacitor in place as well:

It may be that the voltage regulator on the VESC responsible for putting out 5V is overloaded (too much amperage to drive the MCU and transceiver reliably) and so when giving it 5V over USB it may be okay.  I use an arduino pro mini 3.3V+nrf24l01 for my custom transmitter/receiver and also have a cap on the power input for the receiver to help avoid brown outs if the nrf24 is taking more power at any point in time.

You should try it first. If it's sketchy, switch out the antenna. Built-in antenna works but not as solid. Well at least around my area. 

Unfortunately, documentation of such "mods" was done through pms. I'll dig up some pics. 

@Touch415 has done this as well.

This is the only decent pic I have of it. I took it when I was asking Stefan what cap is comparable to what he has/had on my receiver.

I highly suggest shrink warp around the receiver.

Super easy with focboxes. Manual is pretty documented on how to do this.

Unity is different. You need to use the internal UART for the remote. I'm having too much fun riding the board. I'll eventually do some testing again to make feather work w internal UART pins and have metr connect through external one.

@sofu has both working. I believe she has remote connected internally and metr externally. This requires a different firmware tho. Look up her haya build thread. It's all there.

Send me your address. I'll send you a few antennas if it doesn't work. I have 2.4ghz antennas as well as 915mhz ones. I'm currently using 2.4ghz antenna. I should really switch but it's working pretty good right now :man_shrugging: I'll eventually switch it but why fix when it's not broken?

I upgraded the antenna which help lil and also upgrade the whole charging port since mine was defective which @StefanMe kinda disappears wen you have major issues for $200 not worth the pain.. @sofu receiver fell apart and also had a major disconnect going down a hill üò≤ ..

I met up w @thisguyhere because I was having battery issues he sold me. Guess what. It was user error. He found it was my charging port. Damn three prongs. I did continuity check after I soldered. Apparently, the one I used was not meant for charging. Probably ground. It pass the neg continuity check!

I don't have any problems with my remote (well, only user error, but that's normal). Like with everything it's an ongoing R&D project. Testing them WW is a big part of this process, the more user input the better. 

Hey if you only want a remote buy a Gt2b and that's it, right? But if you want something else (way more interesting, at least for me) then stick to the feather and try to sort out your problems with Stefan and the community. He actually puts a LOT of time in the development. Like I already mentioned before: its a one-man job, not a big company. 

Each SW/HW iteration will be better, just stay calm and watch it improve.

We can use vesc tool as SWD programmer :slight_smile:
And then flash nrf51 to use it as a remote and data logger.
And the last, here is my question it's possible to swap the feather m0 to feather LE on your remote to make it compatible? I hope it's not too difficult to port the code from m0 to nrf51 and you have interest üòá

As I understand, the antenna is the most easily replaced part of the remote if someone wanted to improve connectivity. Are there any 'expensive' (please no 5 million dollar woowoo, Im talking about the 30 - 50 dollar range) antennas that would really step up the feathers game in terms of consistency?

afaik no, and neither are mine. I think San Francisco is just a very wirelessly dense city and that results in a lot of interference. I dunno how much being on EU vs US frequency influences things either. 

I think it's likely about packet corruption. Something corrupts the packets transmitted and the receiver reads garbage data. We can very reliably reproduce the cutouts in certain areas and near cell towers which operate around 850MHz or so give or take 50. I was literally unable to move or even push my board on last saturday's ride for a while because every 3 seconds or so the feather could lock brakes because of disconnection. I couldn't even keep it connected long enough to turn off ebrakes. I was around a cell tower at the time, but I was with everybody else (non feather) and nobody else was having issues. They were all using either Boosted remotes (bluetooth) or nano v2 (2.4G?) or those chinaboard remotes (also 2.4GHz).

I think it may be time to switch radio technologies or implement forward error correction for packets received... maybe a hash with each packet received that can be used to reconstruct and crosscheck the packet which can then be used to rebuild the next packet? I'm definitely not a data transmission expert but I was talking with the CEO of Rainway about their forward error correction algorithms. They're able to rebuild each streamed frame basically perfectly at around 40% packet loss and they run their streams over much more noisy and lossy lines than we do. I think that would really improve the experience here...

Not that anybody asked but just my two cents :P

Not an expert either but I believe there has to be some tricks that could be done in the code that would make the communication much less vulnerable to the interference.
But it's something on a much higher level and we would need some help from outside.
Perhaps we could try with some Adafruit forum, because they're the author of the core of this project and they are from NYC as well.

If u switch off the remote, the brakes will release after 10-15 seconds if u need to push next time. (I implented this in case the remote battery is empty)

I have these issues no matter what I'm doing or what's next to me. I can reliably lose connection riding by myself in the following areas:
- San Francisco: Chinatown
- San Francisco: SoMa around 4th & Howard
- San Francisco: Downtown around 4th & Market
- San Francisco: Mid Market around Market & Van Ness
- San Francisco: Twin Peaks
- San Francisco: Central Richmond around Balboa & 25th-ish

You're right, I could have switched off the remote, but I was on top of a mountain and would like to have my brakes on the way down :stuck_out_tongue: It's sort of a dangerous situation either way I think... I would rather go down slowly and stop every so often than have to footbrake all the way down...

One thing I wanted to point out that whenever the remote comes back from standby mode the screen rotates and I can only see half of it. Turning the remote off and back on fixes the problem. But if it goes into standby the issue comes back.

No sorry it's a 2.4ghz remote but I was just remarking on the areas of interference. In parts of SF I'm curious if it is related to the overhead power cables for the bus. Is there a thread for using higher DB antennas? It seems like most people are using pcb antennas or whip antennas. I'm looking at upgrading to antennas that are higher db than what FCC would otherwise allow.

Hey guys!

So I'm planning a project atm and are sitting and comparing controllers
I've been looking at this one and also these ([nano remote](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/firefly-nano-remote/72916/39), [simple remote](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/simple-3d-printed-nrf-remote-arduino-controlled/28543/83))

and I've seen that there are a few things that really matter!

I love the bigger screen on this remote but I'm a bit scared of the 433 Mhz connection instead of 2,4

I'm trying to build a good quality but not the most expensive board


Is there anyone that knows the answers to these questions:
Is there any specific VESC I should aim for that would work better? I've been looking at this one ([VESC](https://www.mboards.co/collections/escs/products/bldc-esc-4-12))

how long does the battery last in a controller like this one?

Should you rather go with 2,4Ghz!?

Could you modify the components a bit in the controller made by solidgeek and then install this software if you buy a bigger screen?

ill update with a link when I've created the thread for my project!

Hi @Winkelmann ! 

I guess there are much less problems in Europe because fo the harder restrictions to frequency ect. The most European peoples doesn't have issues with that. In the US its way harder... maybe the 2.4 Is the choice here... not sure. I am working on a side project to get a 2.4Mhz version working with the Feather Remote. But we can only say more if we give it a good test in the US. Specially the area around @sofu is a hard place.

As soon as I have the first prototype running, I ll let you know. Maybe we should start a community project and not starting developing every person for its own. I am ll to share all my shematics I got now if someone is intersted.

This time I go for an SPI display, because u have less issues with broken communications... on the back is a NRF24L01+ PA LNA transmitter mounted.

When the antennas come in I'll make another post with results after testing but this is where things get interesting to me. Most pcb or whip antennas are around 2 to 3DBi.

But I've found this one at 5DBi, it's probably too big to be in a transmitter but I'm gonna put it on the receiver:

https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/taoglas-limited/FXP70.07.0053A/931-1074-ND/2332701

For the transmitter, I'm going with one of these:

EDIT: Has anyone experimented with running a receiver that runs on both 433mhz and 2.4ghz at the same time for redundancy?

Hey, thanks for such a fast response! yes that might be a good idea, at the moment im not that up to speed with everything since this project is going to be my first board, but i really appreciate all the feedback!

I'll have to look into it a bit more so I know all the pros and cons,

for example one of my friends expressed his love for the [esp8266](https://www.banggood.com/search/esp8266.html) since it can apparently do everything, haha, but I think the battery consumption would be a problem with that

again, i need to read into everything so i know a bit more what im talking about haha

FWIW when I was testing your board and coming back to you while braking it dropped then reconnected very quickly which is why I ran off the board... though if you didn't have any issues further down on the same road it is certainly handling better than the feather...

One thing to consider those style antennas are heavily polarized so how they are positioned could have an effect. Although, the range on them is huge so if you are just standing on it would be surprised.

The more I think about it, a multi-band receiver would be the coolest, you could do 433, 900 and 2.4 all at the same time. You could prioritize throttle to be on 900 and then put the battery info and other packets on 2.4 but also add throttle data to those packets as well.

I think it is definitely not a signal strength issue, but a packet corruption issue. Hoyt does channel hopping on 2.4GHz. which is a really great idea to reduce packet corruption, plus their packets are way smaller.

@sofu

What MHZ are u using? 

If it‚Äôs ecactly 915mhz, we could try a other frequency close to it. 912 for example. Maybe 915mhz is extremely crowded. Maybe this is the big deal here... 

I ll write a short update to change the frequency over the settings tomorrow.

Ahhhh this could be the clue! Going a little out of all the other frequencies. 

@sofu 
I made the frequency now adjustable inside the menu. Just pair the remote and then u can change all the time the frequency from the settings menu. +- 10Mhz. Give it a try with 920Mhz maybe... I don't know. But  maybe the antenna must be shorter or longer for this. But for the test it should work as it is.

I think u just have to update the remote...!

Does your remote have a radio-only mode, which logs dropped packets and control gaps while you ride using a different (known good) remote? This can be useful both for safer testing, but also since a human rider won't always notice radio interference.

I am working on the code...

I have implemented a new option to change the transmitter settings:

There are two value who can highly increase the stability of the remote...
 
` void setRetries(uint8_t retries);`

` void setTimeout(uint16_t timeout);`

U can choose in the settings menu between 5 different modes... maybe one is much better for the critical areas. 

I can recomment 1-5, 6 is more for testing.

The display will maybe also frezze for a few seconds, because i gave the transmission more priority. But the display works normal when u are in the settings menu or lost the connection tottaly.

1. 0/20 (retries/timeout) <- standart
1. 0/40
1. 2/20
1. 5/20
1. 5/40

I ll upload the code later, because i am not at home and i cannot test it.

So....... I'm trying to setup my remote on my vesc6 and its not seeing it. Yes, remote and receiver are paired.

I have done the following to make it work:
* switch remote and controller to a working firmware
* switched rx/tx (I believe this only matters for telemetry. just trying to set my controller endpoints for now). I tried it both ways. Same results.
* tried it on my other vesc6 to rule out my other one. Same thing
* running ackmaniac 1.03 firmware on both vesc6
* did continuity check on jht cables. they all passed

Any special steps I need to do to get this to work?

TIA

I am not sure that everything works fine with the ackmaniack software... I can check this later.

the TX must go to RX and the RX to TX. Please make sure the wires are in this order.

Switch off the remote and board, power on the board at first and then switch on the remote. Have u activated UART and set the baud rate on the connected VESC to 115200?

It was my cable orientation that was messed up. Somehow when I was switching my vesc out. I didnt make a mental note on how I had it plugged in. I had PPM cable connected from VCC to PPM on Vesc. Yes, I had the one end of the cable connected to UART and the other end connected to PPM port. Yes, I was stupid :see_no_evil::man_facepalming:t4::joy: It should have been receiver PPM to vesc PPM. 

Everything works.

https://puu.sh/Dd5px/430c938c60.png

https://puu.sh/Dd5qS/4a68702e05.png

I really don't think it's the power supply. You can see at the end of the video I held it super close and it worked more or less. Plus away from the cell towers I climbed tons of hills without problems.

To be honest I was really scared I was going to crash when I did this test, which is why I was wearing kneepads. And I almost never wear kneepads so that should say something... With all due respect I really don't want to be a guinea pig anymore for this version of the remote and go through that scare again. You can hear my friends laughing in the video but I wasn't. I was pretty on edge. I honestly think it's the transmission frequency that's the problem so I won't test 8-9xxmhz remotes anymore. I'll just wait for you to send the 2.4ghz version before I test it again... if I don't get something else before then.

There are two on Twin Peaks, one is a TV and radio tower which I think doesn't really affect a whole lot probably, the other is I *think* the cell tower. There is also an AT&T cell tower on top of a parking garage I used to sometimes skate in, and whenever I get near that garage I just can't use the remote at all anymore cause it's so bad. That tower runs at 850-900 and there's a sign that says if you cross the fence around it you may die üò¨

@StefanMe 

Is there any way to adjust first initial throttle throw on this remote? It has too much initial dead throw. About 30% ish. I already have dead band set to 2 on remote and 2 on Vesc. It helps when I switched my pos ramp to 0.1. But the initial throw lag is still there.

Is it because of that green area down below? Not the top one for the dead band.

Make sure you calibrate your remote properly so the center in the remote settings is the actual center detected by the remote hall sensor. Then set your input deadband in vesc app settings to something lower. 15% is too much.
```

I have. I always calibrate the remote first before I set the Vesc ppm. 

Dead band settings:
* Vesc 2
* Remote 2

I took that pic before I set the dead band to 2.

Edit:
I figured maybe someone knows another trick or two to get rid of the throttle lag more.

I had the same issue with the Firefly Nano. The first thing to try is try changing the position of the hall sensor and using better magnets.

I also wanted a longer wheel travel so I spread the magnets apart, and managed to get a better throttle curve by slightly tilting the magnet sideways. After some trial and errors I got a nice throttle response with something like this :

Sure, but this one needs ball bearings and a different spring. Which for the story was fixed with a steel screw directly on the wheel between the 2 magnets, which made a weird hole in the throttle response but I got rid of the issue with a nylon screw :-) I can give you the 3D file if you want or export something else,  let me know what you prefer..

Im super interested into the fully integrated solution without going through the feather module. If you need any help I'm at TUM in Garching and UniBW in Neubiberg and have access to a reflow and a pcb mill, happy to help quickly prototype and test stuff! Also can order some parts if you need to test them. I have a solid sample account for TI as well if you need any parts there.

@StefanMe just adding in here that I have had significant cutoff issues with my remote in the past. I had to take the antenna out of the remote case and that caused a major drop in the cutoffs frequency. 

However there are still dark spots where my remote just refuses to respond. I think what happens is that there is frequency connection drops and reconnect at these places.  And because there is estopp enabled, my board does not move at all and I have to push. 

The cutoffs happen near a railway track so I dunno if they have some special train communication towers or something.

I can't remember now what @StefanMe said the issue with mine is but I think I recall it being something like a defective screen or PCB or something. Did a couple team viewer sessions to let him try to fix it but could never get it to work right. It will just freeze and have to be restarted all of the time and not work for longer than 10-30 seconds, the screen always goes blank or doesn't turn on at all a lot of times too, and something else is wrong as well that I'm not recalling since it's been a month or two now. I just wish I could get some type of response... stefan said to send it back once he's closer to being done with a new version so he can swap it out but he hasn't gotten back with me for around a month or so now. Which isn't usually like him and he was usually pretty good about helping until recently..... where you at @StefanMe !!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just wanted to report my trouble with @StefanMe. I've finally reached my wit's end with him and want to caution others before doing business with him. 

In Nov of '18 I paid Stefan ‚Ç¨175 for two DIY feather remote kits. I later realized that the kits did not come with any components, so prior to Stefan ever sending me anything we agreed and I paid him an additional ‚Ç¨58 in Dec '18 for the components I'd need so I didn't have to scourer the internet for them. 

I received nothing for the next few months, and politely asked Stefan for updates every few weeks. After many repeated requests and two and a half months after sending him over $250 USD months prior, I received a small but well packaged box with zero tracking notification. 

I open the box to find a whole slue of missing items, of which I went back through, counted everything and published to Stefan with this chart. Stefan's myriad of excuses over the prior months, the best he could muster up this time was, paraphrasing "I packed everything in there, it must have been opened or fallen out". I would have believed him if it hadn't had a new excuse for me every week prior for it not being in the mail. 

Anyhow, he's now stopped replying to my messages after repeatedly telling me he'd fix the situation. I believe he has the right intention to do so, I really do. I just think he lacks the time and/or will power to follow-through. I say this cause he's never said one rude thing and was always responsive, though this has been entirely frustrating at the same time. 

Anyways, that's my warning. Don't get burned. If you want to purchase these "project parts" off me, myself incurring a big loss, I'd sell them to any interested party. 

Here's the image of what I received:

Here is the list of what I had been promised, including all kinds of missing components from small to large (including an entire Feather basic PCB!) ![](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/d/9d8665f9faab27f398b0353b9d15b8c68f7a30e7.png)

When I purchased my remote from him he was very on time and constantly giving updates. I highly encourage people to buy his products as they're high quality and he gave me many updates. @sofu @pookybear have you guys had any contact with him and how are your remotes going? 

Secondly, his profile is hidden, meaning he probably is not very active or he got banned to some extent. @StefanMe has been off the forum lately for reasons we do not know, or i don't know at least.

State the facts, and nothing else. We're all tempted to be mad, especially me, when you feel you've been duped, but state the facts. You don't think somethings could've been opened when shipping to you? I find that believable. Can I see the packaging it was sent in? Was it already opened, not completely shut?

Nope. Last time I messaged him was about my spare receiver that I have yet to receive. Just asking for an update but no reply. I didn't follow up then as I have no need for it at the moment. Plus, I'm assuming he's working on a newer reliable remote.

Stefan is indeed working on a newer remote, I am sure he wants the best for all users who have a feather remote (he still pushes updates, the last one only a couple of days ago), I guess he has decided to not become so active lately, I can understand his decision. 

Give the man some time, you have to understand that this is a development project, not an off the shelf product, entirely coordinated by only one guy. This fact is easily forgotten a lot of times in this forum...

**To sum up**, Stefan is still alive, working on the next remote gen. (will be a cool one ;) ) and quite busy as far as I know. He'll reach out to you all, in the meantime just use another remote :/

Completely get all of this @bevilacqua and know guys like him and you helping the DIY scene out are bound to have delays and run into issues and I personally can;t express enough appreciation for what you two and the many others due with your talents so I really do try not to bug and sit as patiently as possible waiting for the updates cause I know you guys want to please backers/supporters you have as soon as you can too. 

All most of us need sometimes is just a little more or better communication at times and I can unknowingly assume that those gestures would/will ease the mob and prolly shut most of us up for another short while. 

And in all honesty, @StefanMe  from the beginning was SUPER good at that part of it and EXTREMELY helpful I know to me so when that changed to not getting any type of response or feedback for long periods at all it was almost a feeling of is he ok.... I was on the first round or remotes and haven't got to use it for more than half a ride so am just anxious to get some type of feedback or possible ETA on when something might be happening. Especially now that my next build is waiting for  that and only that. Will keep making due though and hope to hear something from him soon on the new version. Can't wait to get it and use it.

Thanks again for all you guys do.

So would there be any reason 2 remote/receiver pairs wouldn't work in the same vicinity? As in 2 discrete boards + remotes?

I went to ride after swapping in a second remote and as soon as a second remote or receiver was powered up, the first pair would disconnect. I'll have to do more investigating but just curious if there was any inherent issues with more than one in the same airspace... @StefanMe

Look if they are not using the same frequency. 

If that does not work maybe try using the latest development SW of stefans Github. This runs directly via UART (much better) and uses a syncword to verify each package sent.

Both, ppm + uart for telemety. The latest beta FW uses only UART, much better in my opinion 

Still in testing phase tough. But it should, in theory, work as well or better than PPM.

Please feel free to update to the newest version. 

[GITHUB LINK](https://github.com/StefanMeGit/FeatherM0-Esk8-Remote/tree/development_SMD_PCB)

Please make shure to uncomment the correct definitions for your remote in the HEADER -> SETUP section of transmitter.ino and receiver.ino. If u need some help, let me know.

- PPM over UART (no more flickering in the signal etc.)
- possibility to change between more secure connection by SYCNWORD (please change syncWord manually in transmitter and receiver)
- calibration menu on first init of remote or via settings menu (follow the instruction on screen and acknowledge with TRIGGER or MENU BUTTON)

working hard on the newer Version. We ordered the new PCB for NRF today!

I‚Äôm thinking the extension board output voltage to the lights is set by the supply voltage to the module. so if I want to use 3v,5v,12v,42v,50v out put I just need to supply that to the XT30? Can any one confirm this as I‚Äôm not fully shore reading thro the posts and Github if iv understood that correct.

If so am I ok using a buck step down.
Some thing like this? https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/DC-to-DC-Buck-Converter-20-60V-to-12V-2A-24W-Step-Down-Power-Supply-Module/323707451388?hash=item4b5e77b7fc:g:HpYAAOSwiZhccXNg

The input voltage is up to 10s (on some modules up to 12s) output voltage is always 12V if u want a different voltage u have to use a step up or step down converter on the output. I have never tried it. 12 ist most common for lights. I aways build some LED in row.

So dumb question, can you indicate what the polarity is supposed to be on the power input of the expansion board? 

Still not done with the post mortem but I connected everything up with a buck converter feeding it 12v but something happened, blew a hole in the voltage reg on the converter, fried the receiver and the focbox that was supplying it power. 

This was running no expansion board fine for awhile, but it seems like it did something bad to the 5v power circuitry and incorrect polarity is the only issue I could see as the buck converter was outputting 12v fine before.(from 10s) I've patched it all up but I'm out of spare receivers so I'd like to make sure its right this time...

You've connected the single red wire incorrectly. 

The wire should be connected to the PPM under the Servo (the connector is a double male plug but it will work in the triple female slot anyway if you push it in).

Ensure the red wire is connected to this (attached) ![Screenshot_WhatsApp_20190625-233301|250x500](upload://3sRKjsDHR2BJXOsL9b1PbtiLmSl.jpeg)

Make sure you have these set:

* 115200bps instead of 9600
* Choose PPM and UART 

As far as PPM jumping around, it could be that your deadband is too low or loose ppm connection? Mine does this too.

Mine jumps like that too but the positive ramping time basically ignores that.

I noticed your remote batt is "low", is it actually charged? Bc I tried the latest fw and it insisted that my full battery was dead, I had to revert to an older copy to make things happy.

@KranzeKake
Unity is set up to UART and Baudrate to 115200? Wires are connected to (TX to RX and RX to TX?) Do u have the correct firmware on the receiver and remote? Specialy the part #define ESC_UNITY is important.

Is this a nail bolt down with the antenna into the board? Dont manipulate the antenna. The antenna should have a length of 17.5mm. Not more and not less.

Just forget PPM and the JST XH. Just use the UART over the JST PH. Works like a charm.

PPM is just a little bit more affected by interferces. But its worked fine for me. UART control is a bit more state of the art. And the cruise control works so nice now... just drive as fast as u want (even on 5km/h) release the throttle and hold the trigger and cruise...

So far from bench and quick ride test. New firmware took care of the initial throttle throw lag. Smooth! I will test some more tomorrow. Had to go to work.

Seems like line 1867 on the left has added step in getting the voltage var.
its multiplying the voltage that is normally just used on the old code. The remoteBatteryFactor is new which has a value of 

    float remoteBatteryFactor = 0.83; //on line 545

    float voltage = uncompvoltage * remoteBatteryFactor;  //on line 1867

@bsancken 
I couldn't stand the battery being only at 2 bars plus the annoying warning (which I can easily turn off in the settings menu). Here is my "fix".

***Change line 1866 from:***
```
float uncompvoltage = (refVoltage * 2 / 1024.0) * ( (float)total / (float)samples );
```

***To***:
```
float voltage = (refVoltage * 2 / 1024.0) * ( (float)total / (float)samples );
```

***I deleted these lines from transmitter.ido:***

```
Line 454       float remoteBatteryFactor = 0.83;

LIne 1857                   #ifdef DEBUG_BATTERY
Line 1858                     Serial.print("Battery sample value: "); Serial.println(analogRead(batteryMeasurePin));
Line 1859                   #endif

Line 1862                   #ifdef DEBUG_BATTERY
Line 1863                     Serial.print("Battery average value: "); Serial.println(analogRead(batteryMeasurePin));
Line 1864                   #endif

Line 1867       float voltage = uncompvoltage * remoteBatteryFactor;
Line 1868                   #ifdef DEBUG_BATTERY
Line 1869                     Serial.print("Battery voltage: "); Serial.println(voltage);
Line 1870                   #endif
```

I pretty much deleted the debug parts and "remoteBatteryFactor". I referenced it to the older versions that didn't have these lines. It recompiled and uploaded successfully to my remote. 

Previous version of these set of lines worked pretty good for me. Not sure if this is the correct way to do things. I figured there should be no harm from it due to it only for calibration purposes. I could be wrong.

Use it at your your own risk. I will test it when I get a chance.

Been awhile but The remote still needs like line of sight within 3 ft... If I turn my hand or move it, ill disconnect till I move it back causing me to jerk to a stop.

So I have been testing the remotes battery for the past few days with the deleted lines above. I can see the bars go down as I use it more and more. When there is only 2 battery bars left, it doesn't go to 1 bar  blinking (this tells you to charge your remote). The remote just turns off. This is probably why @StefanMe added those lines.

So I looked again at the code to try to understand it. Mind you I'm new to this. I can follow the coding but only partially understand it. I had to refer to Arduino's reference to understand the commands. 

I finally came up with remoteBatteryFactor of 0.95 after a number trial and error. Yes, this is with each fully charged remote and using it to discharge until I hit 1 bar battery level. 

How did I come up w this value? I simply use 4 (# of full bars in remote battery indicator) divided by 4.2v (battery fully charged voltage) which yields to 0.95. Logic behinds this is 1 bar of the indicator represents the level of charge. It actually works.

I ended up building the hardware for the Feather M0 Firefly Nano remote. just wondering what i would need to modify in this code in order to get it running since it uses the same Boards Feather M0 i assume all should be good apart from changing the pins and modifying the input for the second button and the POwer button since this one uses a switch?


Also i cant seem to find the documentation for uploading the code to the remote/reciever. Does anything need to be modified through code or is it all handled through a menu etc?

@StefanMe I know you're plugging along on the new design, but I REALLY like the current one. 

Do you think you'll be trying to update the firmware for the current 915 Mhz Feather to implement channel/frequency hopping and stuff to reduce packet loss? 

Or at least have drop-in 2.4ghz parts for the current remote case?

Hardware and some electrical engineering pertinent to the throttle have been upgraded. The code is the same. I'm still using 2.4 GHZ RF and feather. Things have been going well. Have you been having issues with the transmission?

I'm curious about the transmission issues. I've really had next to no drops is six months of use. I've got several out there now. The big changes that I made were to the throttle. It's a lot more complicated. The throttle on the original project is pretty simple. It could certainly be causing dips and spikes that could lead to resets.

For me I have 2 of Stefan's designs which use 915mhz US feathers and theyre unusable....
If I swing my hand and my leg gets inbetween it'll disconnect.. The antenna is behind a ~5mm plastic wall of the case but that is mounted to the top of my board between my legs.

If I bring my hand up to my chest - disconnect. hold it still - disconnect.
It reconnects fast but it'll just suddenly stop accelerating and that's enough to throw me, especially not good if I'm in traffic.

Had one (a), worked pretty good riding around college. 

Fried receiver of (a) after I lost a Focbox, by the time I rebuilt the board (with a spare receiver) there was an update for the code so I updated. 
(same time) Bought a second one for another board (b).

After I got my board together it worked but I started experiencing my first disconnects while riding with (a)
Experiencing same thing on (b)

Rolled back to the initial code that I was using originally(from my downloads)
Neither controller has been the same since. 

Thoughts or suggestions? Haven't been dropped and I assembled/printed everything..

*Edit -------

Also binding (a) to (b) rx and vice versa doesn't help either

I'm using older code as well. The newest code has some issues with the kill-switch. I couldn't turn it off and I hate kill-switches. Externalizing the antenna could never hurt. I upgraded to a uFL antenna because it was cheap and easy. 

So much of what your saying sounds like a connection is wiggling loose in the remote. It sounds almost too crazy to be a basic transmission issue. To cross that off the list, I would inspect the solder joints, especially if you open and close the enclosure a lot. This can cause the little wire joints to crack. Reinforcing the connectors with a dab of hot-glue will help to ensure that they aren't wiggling loose. I hard-soldered and reinforced my joints instead of using connectors. 

Another suspect is the battery. Though these little lipo batteries are extremely convenient for remote-making. They are also kind of shitty, especially the little ones. I don't use the sleep mode because it uses battery and will run it down and ruin it if you don't use your remote for a few days. Maybe try switching out the batteries.
