Hey guys, I'm making a tennis ball shooting project and I figured I'd use one of my motors and a VESC since I have them lying around. I'd like to control it through the BLDC tool since it lets you pick any particular RPM you want. I was wondering if anyone knew if BLDC tool worked on a Pi so I could attach it to the side and make a tennis ball bazooka.

I did that a couple of months ago and it worked. But i don't remember all the steps which are necessary.
