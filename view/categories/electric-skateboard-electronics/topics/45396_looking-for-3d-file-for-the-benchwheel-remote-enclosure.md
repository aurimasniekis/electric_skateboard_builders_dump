I have this remote (the Benchwheel remote) and I would like to 3D print a new enclosure for it out of blue plastic, so it looks less like a gun. Anyone have a CAD or STL file for the plastic enclosure?

sounds like the right time to start learning CAD tools (like fusion 360) ;)

Already know Fusion360 :smile: If I can't find this file I plan to draw it up myself, maybe with some changes
