I had the same issue with @torqueboards VESC.   What you need to do is open the BLDC tool and go to "Terminal" and type in "faults."

Tell us what it says.

Mine was "DRV8302 Error."  Unless you purchased the $60 warranty @torqueboards won't touch it.  He may let you buy the warranty for $75 after the fact and that entitles you to one replacement.

If you somehow find the inevitable manufacturer defect and show him it he may replace it.

I sold my diy electric skateboards VESC for parts and bought Ollin Board Co. for $170.  This includes a 1 year warranty and repairs after that as well.  Well worth it if you don't want to randomly be thrown off your board. (Which happened to me with the diy electric skateboard VESC)

Are you supplying power to it?  It needs to have power from battery when plugged into the computer.

Ask Dexter then. He might be online in the "chat" function right now at diyelectrocskateboards.com.  Or message him @torqueboards

I may have mentioned him enough that he will see this thread.

Yeah, I wasted $100 on his VESC which worked for a week.  I got an Ollin @chaka VESC and I feel a lot safer.  I definitely made a $100 mistake going with that one. Wish I would have got a better one to begin with.

It's very curious that yours doesn't turn on at all.  Did you check all the battery connections?  Seems like a power source issue.  Could be VESC.

Try bypassing the capacitors with low voltage like 1 battery pack and see it it turns on

You will likely not be able to fix this. You need a new DRV, and likely some other parts also. You need to solder the DRV, which has a somewheres around 30-50 really small pins in total on the 4 sides. The easiest method I've seen is with a reflow oven. If you don't have a reflow oven, you can do it with the right soldering iron and tip, but you need mad skills.

The moral of the story is... Don't buy cheap vescs if they don't come with a warranty. It could be your setup that caused this problem. Or more likely, it was poorly manufactured. Chaka has publicly shown multiple upgrades he does to his vescs that to him are improvements. He rarely has one break from normal use, and wether you break it or it breaks from normal use, he will fix it, and you won't lose your money.

I had this happen with two vescs from enertion (one came with a defect). I was told it was likely my setup that broke them and offered nothing but to buy new ones at full price. With chaka's vescs in the same setup, they have never broken after 1000+ miles. Cough up the money, buy one from chaka, and stop buying the cheapest vescs possible. Theres a reason they are cheap... Chaka has hinted that his vescs cost around $120 in parts alone, without labor. He sources his parts from mouser, which is known to have the highest quality electronic parts. You pay for what you get, and I'm so tired of seeing person after person get burnt by these shitty quality vescs.

I'm still afraid my board is going to rapidly reverse going 15 mph like my Torqueboards (diyelectricskateboards.com) VESC did after a week of use.

Hopefully I will get over this with my new @chaka VESC.

Thanks Ollin!

Could you try to cut the heatshrink off, and take some closeups of both sides, with plenty of light ?
And when taking the heatshrink off, try to smell if any parts are burned and see if there are burn marks, ore holes in the IC's

The chiped circle, is a coil.. its for the switchmode power supply, the missing edge dosnt matter for this purpose

Hi Bryant,

Unfortunately, you purchased without the warranty. If you purchase with warranty we can offer a replacement.
