Hey guys got a new remote from banggood but they forgot the transmitter sadly the remote wont connect with the old transmitter it just keeps flashing while I want to pair. Does that even work with other transmitters or is there a trick? ðŸ˜„ thanks!

Nah I donâ€™t think that will work together. You need the actual receiver for the remote you have. Sorry man happened to me once before too, it sucks

You need [this receiver](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Redcat-Racing-E710-2-4Ghz-Receiver-with-Bind-Plug-E710/232912167198) (Redcat Racing E710 2.4Ghz Receiver).  Also it's not likely banggood forgot the receiver, they sell them separately on the same page but the user interface is confusing.  "Color" chooses either "Transmitter" or "Receiver" on their user interface.  As far as I'm aware, other receivers won't work.  But I could be wrong.

With that transmitter, which BTW is my favorite one, be GENTLE and EASY on the power switch.  That's the first part that will fail.  To prolong the transmitter's life, you need to prolong the switch's life.

Cheers :slight_smile:
