I've searched all over R/C forums and couldn't find a direct answer..
I run my packs currently down to 3.4/3.5V under load, but would it be okay to lower that to around 3.2/3.3V per cell under load?

i'm putting 3.3, yes and cut at 3.1, (I think, its been a while)
should be fine but when u feel the voltage sag (low speed)
U don't have much range left so suggest find place to charge asap. or it actually drop below 3.0 for 1 or 2 cells.

lipos have been getting better over the years and holding there voltage longer, especially the high discharge ones. 

i do a soft cut off at 3.7, hard at 3.5 & only charge to 4.15v

voltage shown is at rest, if you sag down to 3.5v it will come up after resting.

Yeap, it's more accurate. I'm only doing 3.3 because board get cut off  prematurely, too soon for my taste. soon as I hit 3.75 ish I can feel the sag, and go for charge right away. then I get about 3.7-3.6v by the time i get home. 
I also keep track of distance I went.
I found Lipo is hard to deal with on esk8 because after 3.6 the voltage drop so quickly. I had few times nearly killed one cell group, which i revive.
