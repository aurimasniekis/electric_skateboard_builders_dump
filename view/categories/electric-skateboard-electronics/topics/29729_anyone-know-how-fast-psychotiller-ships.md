School starts in 2 weeks and I need to have a mini remote pretty soon here. I'm hoping someone can tell me how long it takes for items to ship (I'm in the US).

Send him a message and ask him. He's a good guy and will certainly help you out if he can.

Ummm...I'm going to talk like I'm not in the room.  Psychotiller ships most things that do not need to be made or assembled the same day it is ordered. He rarely sells things that he doesn't have. Items are shipped USPS Priority in the USA. This means you typically receive your purchase in under 3 days.

Psychotiller has a guy lurking in front of your house right now just waiting to stuff a remote in your mailbox.

That'll explain the voices I heard last night whispering in a raspy voice "come with me to the woods so I can stuff a remote in your mailbox"...

I've bought 8 (I think) enclosures, a set of trucks, some motor mounts, a remote, a couple if sets of wheels, some other miscellaneous gear from @psychotiller...nothing has taken I've 4 days, most in 3. You got nothing to worry about
