From a chart on the site, it looks like they'll also be carrying the 200kv version soon.

I really like that 3 bullet connector! and it looks vesc ready with the jst zh sensor plug!

even that flat side pulley is awesome! maybe better than a keyway!

Haha so you're the guy with the spoiler, I have no idea if it's 100% the same but it looks like it.
Same shape and size, same cables and connectors, same Kv. Not the first time I find Evolve Spare parts in china. 

Here's my BGT btw

Probably not the evolve motors, as it says 1200w max. Evolve should be 1500w. Even though most of these specs are negligible.....

I could check for you, but i feel like they will. When i install my AT kit, all i have to do is scoot the motor back a bit, no other adjustments are needed. Considering the Evolve pulleys are about 15mm, im feeling like it would fit. 

I'm actually surprised more people don't use the evolve kit on their DIY builds.

you think there's a shot they also sell evolve trucks/motor mounts as well? that would be a great find.

I know you can buy the real ones but for 70-85 bucks a piece that's a lot. would be great if they had knockoffs for half that

They're easily installed, and nobody has anything else like it available. Pretty sure there's nothing wrong with plastic pulleys.

 You are honestly one of the biggest most negative trolls on this entire forum. There is nothing useful about your posts in this topic(and most of this forum actually), just negativity. Take your trash attitude somewhere else.

Going to use it with 6S Car ESCs and a 149kv SK3 in a dual diagonal board. It all comes down to the gearing. With the SK3 I am using a 20/50t ratio with my skike pneumatics so this one will be used with a 15/36 ratio to basically get the same top speed.

I bought the Racerstar 5065 from [banggood](https://www.banggood.com/Racerstar-5065-BRH5065-200KV-6-12S-Brushless-Motor-With-Gear-For-Balancing-Scooter-p-1117658.html) and it is a beast!  This is my first build, so I have nothing to compare it to but I'm completely shocked at the hills this thing climbs while still getting about 18-20mph. I am using the 15T gear it came with, but might swap it for a larger one.

The holes on the motor would not align with the motor mount, I had to dremel them a little larger. But again, I don't have another to compare it to.

And getting that pulley off the first time was a nightmare. It was caked in loctite. Luckily my dad had a bearing puller.

I am unsure whether to get the Racerstar 6368 (https://www.banggood.com/Racerstar-6368-BRH6368-280KV-6-12S-Brushless-Motor-For-Balancing-Scooter-p-1117659.html) or the NTM Prop Drive 270kV (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/ntm-prop-drive-50-60-270kv-2400w.html). I am only 50kg and will be running these on a 7s6p battery pack of 2500mah liion cells (Samsung INR 18650 25R) on a 16:48 gear ratio - would the extra size of the 6368 give me more torque? The reason I ask this is that the Racerstar motor draws 480W at 24V, whilst the NTM prop drive is said to draw 2400V on a 8s.

All I know banggood motor's have also hall sensors if youre into that later..

Prop drive is seriously smaller.. compared to 6368 Racerstar

With banggood's motors, you have to take into consideration that unless you make custom motor point, Ive heard that screw holes dont align with the one's turnigy and other motors use, so you would either have to redrill a holes a little bit.. (if you use ready made mount) or make the mount yourself.

Cannot really tell which one would give more torque.. the Kv ratings listed are pretty close to each other, but you still cannot know for sure what kv they actually are under load, I think, since Ive seen some people measuring the kv, and not always it has been as specified (or this was the thing with Torqueboards motor's ? )

Oh nice! You got the 200kv, right? what kind of motormount do you use? and the pulley it came with; is it HTD-5M?

I'm running single TB 190kv, but i'm considering an upgrade to dual 140kv to get more climbing power and traction. Our Norwegian hills are steep! I don't know if that would work with 10s though.

Yeah, the 200kv came with a HTD-5M 15 tooth pulley and fit perfectly with the belt & gear that came from [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/322391161432) eBay listing. But that did not come with the bracket, so I use the one from this [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/311770052028) listing.

It looks like banggood changed the listing, and it no longer comes with the pulley. How would you even find a pulley that has that specific key/slot shape?

What brand of movies? Did you mean motors?

Well that YouTube channel is named Rotor Riot and they're all about quadqopters.

The factory he is visiting is BrotherHobby. If you look at their website it seems they manufacture these motors for other brands like Racestar. I guess it's essentially the same motor regardless of the brand.
And I have to say those hubs look pretty familiar..:

```
you don't use all the power of the motor . maybe <500W . You get that max power(not ok,too hot) if you use this motor at 36V with 34A(max current) you will get a motor with 36*34W Power so 1.224(in the specs it say 1200).
 I'm not good on phisics but if you want to drag an object with a 
mass of 90kg you will need a force. 
F=ma and that depend on what speed do you want.maybe 40km/h
and if we want to reach that 40kmh in 1 min we need acceleration=(40km/h)/60s=(11.11m/s)/60s=0.18m/s^2 acceleration so now we can calculate the force that we need 
F=90*0.18=~16N force
and how P=F*v we need a P of ~=16*11=**176W**  and to get that you need maybe a 11.1V-18.4V battery to get a high power over what we need becouse of friction,torque etc.

Guys, I just bought one of this motors(I choosed the 140 KV, did I get a good choice??), some gears and plugs.

Now If you could give me more information about motor mounts for this piece and some tips that could be usefull would be nice. Like what ESC should I use and batteries.

Did I get a good motor?? I was in doubt about buying the 140 KV or the 200KV, I took the 140 KV because only just of the torque. But was difficult to take a decision, was this decision good??

See ya
