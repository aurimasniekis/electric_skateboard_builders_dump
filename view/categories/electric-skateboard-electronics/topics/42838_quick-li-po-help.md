Loop key just goes in between plus towards Vesc.

Charging and balance connections depends on if you want to add a BMS or charge them separately with a balance charger. 

Anyway, plenty of topics discussing the above mentioned options.

Sounds like you are sorted, but here’s how I did the same.

Could you provide the names of the cables you used?

Sorry, I don’t know the names.  I made the cables myself.  They are just 10 or 12 awg silicone wire, from Hobbyking I think, connected to XT90, XT90s and XT60 plugs.
