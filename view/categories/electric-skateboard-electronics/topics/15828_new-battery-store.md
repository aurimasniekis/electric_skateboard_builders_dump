Will 10C be enough discharge? I'm used to seeing 15-30C on most batteries

I don know, just 'looking' at the moment.  Got other stuff going right now, but I'm hoping that if I use x3 that would equal 30c, but I dont know if it works like that.

With a large capacity c rating isn't as important.  C rating times ah gives the supposed continuous discharge. 

15 (15,000mah)x 10 (c)is a lot of potential discharge.  But they exaggerate so use half the c rating for a more realistic comfortable discharge: 75 amps continuous is good.

Woah, this store is a nice find! I think prices are quite astonishing (in a good way). I used to get about half the capacity for a similar price, plus, for you guys, shipping to usa is for free, if the order is over 40usd (which it probably will be anyways)..
