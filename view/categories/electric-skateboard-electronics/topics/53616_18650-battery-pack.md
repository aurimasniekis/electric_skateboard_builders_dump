I was lucky to find imr in my back yard ( Huston) and Iâ€™m in Austin so it works out perfect. I donâ€™t have to shelf batteries for any amount of time. They overnight and always in stock.

Yes, I build them. As far as shipping overseas, I have a feeling its expensive shipping, takes long and will cost you more in your countries duty fees. Im going to talk with my ups agent and see just what the deal sand try to get as much info as possible. I will get back to you
