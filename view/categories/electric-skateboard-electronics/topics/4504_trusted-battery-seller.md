I'm looking around now for 18650 batteries, and hear Samsung ones are pretty neat, and are a good way to go. I saw these on Aliexpress for a pretty decent price (8 pieces fo 20 USD) but thought it may be too good to be true. Are these sketchy?

Link to check it our yourself: http://www.aliexpress.com/item/8PCS-lot-New-Original-Samsung-18650-ICR18650-26F-2600mAh-Li-ion-3-7v-Battery-Free-Shipping/32609856540.html?spm=2114.40010208.4.2.vB3NOY

If these are dodgy, where do you guys recommend me buying bulk for relatively cheap, I have $400 to spend on batteries for a Bigfoot 160 monodrive build.

Edit: I'm located in Australia, if that helps.

Liionwarehouse if you are in US. I am going to get my cells from FastTech (I am in Australia) they have good reviews but the cells ship by boat so it takes like 1-2 months.

they look pretty legit always read the comments and especially the negative. The more comments the more purchases have been made for the product

If i remember correctly, the green 25r is better? Forgot why, perhaps increase life cycle.....forgot, you can look it up.

I too am in Australia. So I might check them out

Edit: Forgot to ask, are they cheapish? I'm on mobile and not enough time to check right now. I have around $400 AUD to spend on batteries, hoping to have a little bit left maybe a bit less than $100 to spend on enclosures and extra bits.

5.2A discharge rate. Wouldn't be suitable for eskate unless you had about 10 in parallel, so you'll probably want to look for a different cell. Also, I wouldn't trust the legitimacy of alibaba products, but that's just me. Try the Samsung 25R like Enertion uses.

Last time I checked ( and that was a LONG time ago)enertion uses (used) LG 's. 

My information could be outdated

So I should go with the Samsung 25R ones?

I'm looking at the Liionwholesale site, it's around $4 for 40 batteries, which is how many I intend to get.

EDIT: doesn't ship to Australia, but I can find one that does, but basically, that battery is the one to go yes?

That is the one yes. I was just about to say that they don't ship to Australia.

You mentioned you were getting it from FastTech? When I check out it says Australian Expedited Air or something? 9 days in transit, or something along those lines? No option for shipmail, unless that was the one.

http://liionwholesale.com

I have ordered hundreds of cells from them and every single one has checked out. Not a single dud. The more you buy the less they cost there too.

Also they don't waste time getting them to you. You'll probably have them in a week. 

I use the Samsung INR18650-25Rs because they're basically made for our applications at a 20 amp continuous rating and a 100 amp burst which is ludicrous.

why not get the LG cells?  

http://liionwholesale.com/collections/batteries/products/lg-hg2-18650-battery-genuine-tested-20a-3000mah-flat-top-wholesale-discount?variant=3263844292

~20% more capacity, negligible price difference, similar discharge - am I missing something?

I don't think the price difference is negligible it's like 80 cents which is big deal when buying a few hundred at a time as some of us do
```

## \#20 Posted by: DougM Posted at: 2016-06-10T19:52:39.703Z Reads: 167

You're right - I was thinking the price difference was $4.69 vs. $4.91 but I went back and looked and it's $4.69 vs. $5.91, a ~20% difference.

So in terms of capacity per dollar it's almost exactly the same, but still I misread.

yeah i buy them 50 at a time, and if i start getting more orders closer together i'll be buying more at a time. 

I almost have enough leftovers to build a small pack for my kid's powerwheels fiat 500.

Yeah, I bought those same batteries from FastTech, apparently they have a pretty decent rep, and they have a 45 day refund policy and 6 month return. I wanted to get from Liionwholesale, as it was cheaper, but there wasn't an option to ship to my country. 

Now to figure out how to put the batteries together, and to get a soldering iron. Would a small battery pack that fits in an enclosure similar size to the Boosted Board be possible?

The only downside with BatteryBro is how long it takes to get the batteries.  They seem to ship out of China at the time you order.

they quoted me at 2 day lead time and 5-7 shipping but, we shall see.

and yeah they ship out of china, their a team people in china hired by Americans to find legit battery makers and then selling from them to you at a small mark-up (12 cents a cell on my order of 50)

I sent them an email for 50 LG HG2's multiple times but I got no reply so I figured they may be on holiday. Clearly that's not true.

@delta_19 How did you get such a good deal on the batteries????

get a business quote on a min order of 50 and they will send you a message that they received the quote. if after 48 hours they still dont get back to you just reply to that quote request saying you have yet to get the price and they will look after you.

so far i have paid and they say they mailed out my order, they say its with Chinese customs and once it passes through it will be 2 days to get to me

**Update**

FastTech was insanely fast, I took less than a week to ship to me from the US to Australia. It shipped on the 12th and arrived yesterday on the 17th. All came here safely in some nice boxes to protect them, I'm yet to test them, but they should work.

That's a super deal. How much was a set of 50 shipped to you?  What BMS would be good for a 10S4P build like the SPACECELL PRO?

I use the 80 amp version but yeah, so far so good on those BMSs. I'm probably going to drop to the 60amp version next time though.
