I've been looking at the same ebay controller too for the past week. But since it's not programmable like those VESC controller, it looks like you need to short some connectors to match the voltage on the battery pack (36V, 24V, etc). But there's no diagram/pic on how to do that. 

Anyone has info on which pins/connectors on the board need to be shorted? Thanks.

It only says something like "6S/7S don't connect  36V：6S/7S don't connect is 36V" or "10S 36V：disconnect those 2 dots on position 2 on the picture, disconnect those 2 dots on position 3 on the picture".

I did, but I guess I wasn't very clear. My mistake. The seller only shows the diagram for a single motor one capacitor (not for dual motor, two capacitors). This is the only one that I could find from that ebay page. I think the dual motor one supports 10s (maybe?)

Hey @psychotiller how are these realistically?

Considering this for the potato with a max usage of 10-15mph at most.

 Not looking for power really, just good enough to throw a cheapie slow board together. But not have stupid braking like a car esc....

Might bite the bullet snd try it for $56 bucks for a dual with remote...lol it's either that or throw focboxes on  $56 vs $300...hmmm

## \#60 Posted by: Chase Posted at: 2018-08-12T19:41:26.445Z Reads: 147

These esc have push to start. When it turns on it makes a beep. If your battery is dead it makes and you ride the board it will still beep as if though it’s about to start but it won’t. With mine, it’s fine to free ride, you just hear this annoying beeping every few seconds when it’s trying to push start from a dead battery. The only issue I really have with these esc is the delayed cutoff of acceleration. Sometimes when you stop pushing the throttle, the wheels will continue to spin for a few seconds. It’s easy to get used to but it seems to bother some riders a lot.

Hey! Im currently picking parts for a board and i have no idea how to choose a good/ compatible ESC (I'd like to keep the build relatively cheap) Im thinking about using:

Motor:  https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?___store=en_us

and Battery: https://www.mboards.co/collections/batteries-1/products/10s3p-battery-complete-battery-solution

any suggestions?

## \#62 Posted by: Chase Posted at: 2018-08-12T23:34:10.352Z Reads: 137

Your best bet is just to get a vesc. They are made by several different companies with a popular choice being the focbox. You can get a cheap single motor esc like the versions shown above but they won’t be able to handle large continuous currents and work better for commuter boards with small batteries.

In short, get a vesc, you can get them as cheap as $100 for a single motor.

O.K. thank you, and yes the board beeps all the time. The braking should not be used without battery, or is the breaking disabled then. If not the capacitors could burn? Have not tested yet.
The delay when stopping acceleration I can confirm too. But I have the feeling that
the delay is somewhat random. Possibly the remote signal is to weak ?

I know this is what they use in the Rideriptide R1.
I've been considering swapping it to 10s and or tossing some different Motors on there. ( especially since @hyperIon1 has some 5055s for sale) Maybe new 5055s or upgrade to 6355. I've got spare motor mounts for both. Anyone know if they run better on a high or low KV?(at 10s)

```
Low, the esc has a erpm limit meaning you can't exceed about 6400 rpm, which with common gearing is about 40km/h. At 10s the best kv to maximise torque and speed is around 150- 190kv, any higher and you aren't gaining anything, just loosing some possible torque. 

The most effective way to gain more speed is to the change the gearing to a lower ratio like 2.25:1 or 2:1
```

Thanks pat. I'm okay with this board only going 20mph. 
I honestly just want to sell it to my buddy because he really wants it (and I'd rather build my own compact board) but I think it would probably hurt my wife's feeling seeing it was a gift.

You know what to do then... give her the board to ride together

Oh that's kinda the plan.
Thing is I know she's more comfortable (especially at higher speeds) on a longboard.
I'll probably turn my Santa Cruz drop deck into a basic build for her.
