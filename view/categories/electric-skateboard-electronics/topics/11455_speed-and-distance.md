We'll need to know the capacity of the cells in Mah to give an estimate for range

Price is also quite important.

I can get roughly 40km from my board and, if my app is to be correct, top speed I've recorded thus far is 46.6 km/h and I weigh just over 90kg.

My setup:

Enertion Space Cell PRO 4
Enertion 6374 Big Boy Motor
Enertion Drive Train
Enertion VESC
Winning Remote

Total cost of everything was just under â‚¬1000

no that is not at all possible with that battery pack. it is much too small. 

i would go for a standard 10s4p battery pack.  which will give you 20 miles depending on riding style.

Will a 10s3p work ?
Will a 2960 watt supply battery break a max power 2700 Watt motor 
Will they just work or will it crush 
I'm not pretty sure about the power current and things like that my main concern now is not to burn any electronic
