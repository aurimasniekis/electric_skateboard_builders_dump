So idk if this is really worth a post or not, but dammit im glad i finally found it. I knew there was something off with my battery. It kept drifting and i kept manually balancing it... hoping to magically find the problem and I did. I noticed one P group kept dipping off... so with my NESE modules i pulled that group. Pulled every cell out of that P group and balanced each one.. when i went back to the whole pack. The other P groups had dropped some so i dropped each cell with a 18650 flashlight out of the pulled group again manually. Well this time when i went to put the group back.. all the packs P groups had drifter by .001 or so and i wanted perfect(also I found this a bit odd)... so i watched what group was having a had time charging and i found it. 3.915 was that NESE packs voltage... i measured a few and they were 3.917. I said huh.. so I kept checking and i found this guy. ![20190404_135700|375x500](upload://61cnN6XNZvmYIulyivYPZmO3UmO.jpeg)

Anyways, sorry for the long write up but maybe  maybe someone will find this helpfull. And i just really felt proud for finally finding what I sensed was wrong.

Nice catch! Luckly you have NESE modules and can be up and running soon.

Do you know what made it go bad? Or was it totally random

Ikr, the whole reason I bought NESE. They just saved my 12s8p pack i hopeüòÖ  Nooo clue, these a BRAND new and only had like 5 charges on them.... i did go to iowa with my board and it was cold, but i tried to keep it inside and i didnt even ride itXD

Me either but legit, thats the only thing I could even grasp at causing it. Kinda scary lol 
But yeah its the price of learning and having a cool board... at least bc i started this to learn a lil and have a fun rideXD

Yeah man, ive been struggling to figure it out. I ordered two extra than what my pack holds just in case though. So I have a genuine replacment. I'm manually charging to match Voltages

Last time i couldnt get the whole pack to charge up to 50.4 and float charge. It would only reach 49.? something.... And thats where my suspicions started. So if it reaches 50.4 Ill consider all systems healthy. Im using a 2 amp charger so it might take some time![20190404_180742|374x500](upload://44fIqAfjRc4BXRjSKet7rCoG96b.jpeg)

I did just have suspicions of maybe my other charger ive been using. Its a meanwell LED ballast that turns 100-240V into an adjustable 48-50.4V 1.2-5amp. Idk maybe, no electrician XD. Just shooting in the darkXD or maybe it was just a bad cell lol who knows. Glad to see my pack starting to look healthy. Maybe some lights and bluetooth later

Due to defects in the cell the internal resistance can get crazy high. Basically it won't charge but it won't damage the other cells either, because of the same high IR. So it just stays there being a dud.

So like the 7th cell.

can you feel any deformation on the thin parts (outer side of the box, close to the poles)? (its supposed to be perfectly flat.) I can't see that clearly through the pictures. Furthermore: How is your riding style and what terrain do you do?

Ive literally only charged this pack twice, my riding was mostly flat pavement. Some high vibration terrain, but very brief. Nothing in those areas like that.. not that i can feel or see. I might feel, on the exterior pots maybe a lil bump..its hard to tell nese fits tight anyway..

Good. I had a pack that had a cell getting hot which led to a deformation at this area causing the pack to imbalance due to lower pressure. Its good that the new version has this area in the same thickness as everywhere else.

Something to keep in mind as you chase battery voltages.
"3.915" volts is NOT **3.915** volts. In fact. your "3.917" volt cells in reality could be identical in real voltage to the "3.915" volt cells. You simply can't determine this using typical voltmeters.
At these levels, it is highly unlikely any of your voltmeters are capable of an accuracy of +/- 0.01 volts let alone 0.001 volts. _Most_ are at **best** accurate to about 3 digits, and then you tack on a % error AND a +/- 1 full digit. Accuracy can also depend on which voltage scale a measurement is being made.
Check the detailed specs of your voltmeter.

This isn't to say cell voltages can't be used to help diagnose problems because techniques like successive **comparitive** readings can still be revealing. Just be aware that what you see is NOT necessarily the reality...at least not to the level of accuracy you think it is.

Yet, there's a world of difference between 4.24v and 4.16v (both round to 4.2v).

True, but my Voltmeter also has 3 decimal places and I let each cell sit and level out. I know its not perfect but its better than doing nothing and having NO idea what any of my cells are doing. ![15549952322671169239598|375x500](upload://kWjnXeNvvangGNpk1KiyQRukShG.jpeg) Im not using a walmart VoltmeterXD
Crappy pic and just some random V, but you get the point

deucesdown said, _"Yet, there‚Äôs a world of difference between 4.24v and 4.16v (both round to 4.2v)"_
Not necessarily...at least in the real world. For example, I just used 3 popularly available handheld DMMs and 1 Lab Bench DMM (actually way more than a DMM) to measure the same battery, at the same time, and in reverse lead polarity separately. No load applied to cell other than probe/meter impedance. All meters had new, verified "good" batteries installed. Note that voltage of the battery that powers a handheld DMM can have a non-trivial effect on the accuracy of the meter. Some meters are less affected by this factor than others. It's good practice to always test the DMM batteries before conducting critical measurements.

The quick test readings were:

Measurements Vdc at the same time (all 4 meters connected in parallel to the same cell under test):
M1= 1.41;
M2= 1.43;
M3= 1.46;
M4= 1.45 (Lab Bench DMM, last calibrated July2018)

Measurements taken separately:
M1= 1.41;
M2= 1.42;
M3= 1.46;
M4= 1.45

Measurements taken with the only change being the leads were reversed. Ideally, there should be no difference between these and the original readings. Original readings were re-verified to the same values as shown above. This test was performed back-and-forth several times with consistent results.
M1= -1.42;
M2= -1.42;
M3= -1.43 **significant difference**;
M4= -1.45

Note that M3 is a $90 namebrand handheld DMM, yet by simply reversing the leads there is about 2% difference in the measured voltage. This was difference persisted across several voltage scales. When there is that kind of difference in the SAME meter measuring the same voltage, one can see the potential for measurement errors on any comparable device, and one cannot assume that a given reported value is the actual value.

Im very aware of the difference in the switched poles. It has helped me wire correctly a few timesXD and im always aware of the Neg that appears if i switch the leads, as it will notify you the poles are incorrect.... okay, but i did read the latter part of that, noting the 2% difference as well..... but that being said, ide still take having this much information over NO information

Just because a meter displays 3 decimal places does not mean it is accurate to 3 decimal places, and in my experience, namebrand doesn't mean much anymore when it comes to accuracy. Hyper-accuracy/resolution claims are the biggest mistakes made by people who rely on digital readouts...they take the displayed value as absolutely accurate to the last number even when most of the digits reported are meaningless. People may report a value to 10 displayed digits when only the first 3 digits are meaningful in real-life. For more info, look at the specs and search internet for references like 
[ _dmm voltage accuracy and resolution_ ]

Again, I emphasize that doesn't mean one cannot diagnose problems like these, but you do have to understand what it is you're looking at and what kind of claims can be made...or not made. Not doing so can result in coming to the wrong conclusions and even lead to damaged devices.
