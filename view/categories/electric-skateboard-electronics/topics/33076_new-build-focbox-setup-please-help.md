Ok so going to put up a new post in the electronics section. Please can some of you experienced esk8 heads, take a look at my setup and let me know if you think I am setup safe. don't want to blow anything.

Setup is 2x 4s 20c in series (8s), focbox and 270kv motor running in FOC, gearing is currently 2.4:1 but will be changing this soon to 3:1. My weight is about 11stone/70kg

Currently I have limited it to 45A but would like to go higher if possible. Is it safe to go up to 60A???

Thanks peeps!
