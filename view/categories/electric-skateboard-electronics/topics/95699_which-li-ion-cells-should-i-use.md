I've decided that I prefer all the benefits of using 18650's, so found some laptop batteries and I've found some LGABD11865's I'm struggling to find other people using these for batteries packs. Is there a reason for this or are others just more common? sorry if this is a stupid question I'm new to Li-ion batteries.

You need to do alot of research on cells before you buy. Shipping will often be a killer unless you buy in bulk.


For most people, it costs significantly more to build a single pack than it does to buy one.

You need a spot welder, specialized components, and experience with working on dangerous cells. 

I dont want to discourage you, but building your own packs can be a massive headache.

Solderless NESE modules are an option, but to answer the question I think the Samsung 30Qs are the most commonly used ones but of course it depends on the battery size you want. 12s4p 30Q is quite common since it has a solid capacity and solid discharge (in large enough packs but it will depend on what you need), enough for the average build/most builds

They are, but the end cost can be more than a simple welded pack. They are also a fair bit bigger

These LG cells can't provide enough current for an esk8 and would sag instantly. 30Q cells are good for about 20A, these LG ones can only do about 5A.
