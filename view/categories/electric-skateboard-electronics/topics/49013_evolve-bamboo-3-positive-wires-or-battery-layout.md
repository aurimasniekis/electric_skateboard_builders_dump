Currently rewiring/making this pack ready for a BMS, but I noticed there are 3 output / positive wires, all soldered to the same point.

I know one would be used for the charger, one for the main output / XT90 and the last one?

And does anyone by any chance have a picture of the layout? Would make my life 10 times easier.
