I know with Lipos it's bad to leave them fully charged. Is that the same with li ions? I charged my 10s4p a few days ago and have had absolutely no time to ride. Should I find a way to discharge it? Or is it fine for about 4-5 days?

I'd say its fine for a few days. Just be sure to bring it to storage level sooner or later
