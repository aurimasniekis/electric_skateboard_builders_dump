Hi guys, hope someone can help! I can't seem to get vesc tool mobile to work on my phone, any ideas? Also I cant get the BT module to work with metr or ESC monitor, ESC monitor can see the BT module but won't give any data, my phone can see it but won't pair.
Would be awesome to have data.
Any help much appreciated

On the vesc front, what do you mean by properly? 
Phone is an old moto g5?
Does the phone make a difference?
