Finally got my board finished and took it out for a ride. FAILURE ðŸ˜­

10s Lipo
Dual VESC
Dual 6374 190kv
15/36
97mm Clones

I made about a 10 minute ride and noticed my board felt sluggish all of a sudden. Knowing I was nowhere near the voltage or temperature shutdown I stopped and removed my enclosure. One vesc was still operating perfectly, the other would flash 3 red lights when I applied throttle. I took the board home and plugged it into the BLDC tool. The still running vesc, no errors. The other vesc, DRV 3802 Error. How can one vesc die and the other keep going. They are literally set up identical. They are joined with a Y Cable with one of the 5v wires clipped. The board was running perfectly!

If it makes a difference for anything. The vesc with the DRV error was setup on a brand new 6374.

I had that happen to me once. Could be a plethora of things. Can you see what the current ramp step is currently?

Those all look okay. Could have been an ERPM issue (you've got it set to 100,000, I usually say 60,000), but I'd be surprised. can you get a screenshot of the motor advanced tab?

There's your problem. the max current ramp step is 40 and it's suppose to be .04
this is certainly what blew your DRV chip
Yours

This is caused by a ramp step bug that was present in an old version of vesc firmware.

Aside from that issue, your motor max is really low at 55a. most motors can go 80a easy.
And your Battery min setting is really high at -35a and is might be more than your battery can handle for regen charging.

Creds to @rpn314 for thinking of it first.
This is a fairly old issue that was corrected some time ago with revised firmware.

Unfortunately I have never had a vesc with this issue and when I purchased this one I wasn't aware of such an issue. I purchased this vesc from a member here who is a great guy and very credible. This is a tough lesson to learn.

Any clue what it will cost? Pretty sure this was a repaired cheapo vesc to start with. It may be worth buying used or cheap. I plan to do the @Titoxd10001group buy for 2 FOCBOX.

Sorry for the loss, but glad I could help you find the issue! If you haven't already, I'd check the second one as well, just to be safe :slight_smile:

My pleasure! Good. Just in case, you check it by writing and read a few times. The values shouldn't change. The bug was when you wrote data, it would increase by 10x. It was a bug with the initial release of 2.18 and plagued many of us (me included). It was fixed, but the firmware version was not incremented so both the buggy version and the clean version are v2.18 and the only way to tell is the repeated read/write above.

Quick question and a complete thread hijack.. 

What's with the solution thing? Can only mods pick which comment is the solution? I looked and could not see antlything in the threads I have created.

@JLabs The solution option was enabled (forum wide) by onloop a few weeks ago. It was just disabled when the forum was created way back. I believe the topic creator and maybe the mods can select the solution.

I just checked my other vesc and noticed it too has the wrong value. I have never checked this so I guess I'm lucky it didn't blow as well!

0.04 looks like the right value...or is that picture after you changed it?

The moral here is to always reflash f/w when you buy a VESC.

Oops that pic was after I changed it. It was .40 when I read it. What do you guys think about flashing to @Ackmaniac firmware?

Why not :), you can also flash the stock f/w again, which should be a fixed version depending when you downloaded BLDC tool. Also, according to @ackmaniac on the buggy f/w you should write to .04 and make it read .40 as it's an issue with the tool reading from f/w. This means that while you're reading a .4 value, the actual value is .04.
