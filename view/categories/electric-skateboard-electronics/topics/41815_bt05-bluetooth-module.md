I installed a BT05 bluetooth module to connect it to my maytech vesc but when i pair it with my phone, it says connected but doesn’t let me do anything to the vesc. I’m using Jacobs app. bldc tool. It’s driving crazy, i’ll post pics later, any help is greatly appreciated.

I’m pretty sure you need the hm-10 module not the hc-05. That’s likely your problem

Hey 
The BT adaptor is an HM-10
Also not sure how you got jaccob a app since I can't see it in the store but the iOS app I was telling you about is @emmaanuel app

Here is the is the iOS link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eskate-vesc/id1276043481?mt=8

Here is the link to the forum post about the app: www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-version-2-1-ios-eskate-vesc-app-for-standard-and-ackmaniac-fw/32340

Oh my bad.
In that case you can use @Ackmaniac app
Here is the link to the play store:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ackmaniac.vescmonitor

Also if I'm not mistaken you will need his firmware if you want to change settings from the app. If not you can just monitor.
