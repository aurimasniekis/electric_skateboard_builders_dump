Yes, I have a previous thread regarding my poor motor making weird noise. I never found out what was the cause since it made several different sounds. Either it squeeked, knocked or ticked. Some noise was there from the start (although not as loud as it later developed into..), and some came along the way.

Anyways. I previously opened up the motor and it looked as if something had rubbed against the magnets. Very lightly I believe, and I couldn't find the cause of this rubbing/grinding. 

Today is the day when it escalated to the point where I believe my motor will never get older than 3 months. 

It started making this loud ticking noise, so I stepped off, removed the belt and went home motorless. 

Turning the motor by hand NOW does give significant resistance. Not all the time though. Sometimes it's turning ok and ticking isn't as loud.. 



I think i saw this in another thread and maybe it was the magnets coming loose, but not sure. Before opening it up, what do you guys think would cause this noise?

The only reason you would get a significant increase in motor resistance is because of a short.

From reading your past thread, I can see you never had it running without at least some of these issues. 

The scratching of the magnet and stator is very concerning. You will short the motor very quickly with damage like that. By removing some iron from the stator, your creating an irregular magnetic pattern that could cause weird behavior.

My problem is, what the heck is causing that grinding? I would assuming a pebble or something, but it's clearly not since you already cleaned it out to make sure.

It could be that the magnets are falling out, but from the picture, they look fine and the scratch pattern is consistent on every magnet. If it was just one loose magnet, I would expect to see the scratch more so on that lose magnet and less or not even at all on the other magnets.

Other wise, I'm assuming one of these noises is from the bearings. Besides side to side play and stator/magnet rubbing, bearings are the only other mechanical place where you can get some irregular noises. It's also the most common place to get noise in a motor.

Check the magnets again carefully. make sure they are firmly attached (maybe pull on them with some tweezers side to side). If not, one option is to sand the magnets down a bit so they don't rub. Not a great option, but it's better to sand the magnets than to have them rubbing and damaging the stator. It's possible that rubbing though was a result of some debris in that came out when you took it apart the first time (possibly without you even noticing something feel out becuase it could be very small).

**My first piece of advice**: put some wd-40 or bearing lubricant in the bearings and see if any of the noises go away or get better. That last video, entirely sounds like dirt in the bearings IMO.

If there's still problems, try spinning the bearing by hand and see if they spin smoothly. You might need to replace the bearings.

Thanks for taking your time going through these threads.

Opened up the motor again. Both bearings seem fine, ie no noise when turning, no resistance.

The magnets show signs of grinding, and it's worse than when I previously checked the motor.

Can't see anything that looks like shorted phase wires.

I'll investigate further.... üôÅ

Ok. Removed the stator from the motor mount and on the side (that was) facing the deck it looks like there's been excessive amounts of epoxy where the sensor wires are glued onto the windings. 

Also the wire wrapping is grinded down, clearly torn and sticking out making contact with the magnets. Motor inside is somewhat covered in a fine fine black powder, maybe the grinded down epoxy? 

Manufacturing error, right? What do you say @fottaz?

This whole motor stinks of manufacturing defects.

I was going to ask about the sensors and how they are mounted. Seems we have our answer there.

As someone whose spent the last 2 years researching and developing hub motors, and as someone who personally winds and assembles motors, that motor a. has more space for more copper, so shame on them. and b. you are better off mounting the sensors near the back of the motor rather than running it across to the smaller side.

Were you able to check both bearings. I have the same clicking noise, almost to a tee, on my carvons and some lube eliminated most of the problem.

I'm sorry for the bad manufactured motor, just after few reports as yours, I got the maytech ones in stock.

I will be glad to offer you a good discount on the new Eskating motors if you are interested.

If those faults were out before I could swap the product instantly, unfortunately I don't have that long warranty on electric stuff.
About Maytech, I could even add a very long warranty because all 1st stock was 100% fine compared to the old motors batch, and they are very very powerful and well done.

Checked bearings again. Using an axle that turns both bearings wouldn't create any noise whatsoever. No clicking and no resistance, so I guess bearings are at least ok. Not the cause of the noise.

However, I could see that even the stator teeth showed some grinding on the very upper part (closest to where wires exit). Checked the magnets and several of the magnets are easily moveable side to side. This is just getting worse :-(

The moving magnets could cause the clicking sound they are not supposed to move at all

Hi Alberto!

Thanks for offering a discount. 

I'm a bit disappointed though that the motor can't be replaced. I did address these issues 1,5 months after having the motor delivered to me. That was just less than 2 weeks after having ridden the board for the first time (as one can see in my build thread). 

If a motor has these many manufacturing faults, I'd reckon one would issue a complaint to the manufaturer requesting refunds for faulty products, so there should really not be that big of a loss even for the seller, right? 

Anyways. Let me know if there is any other way to solve this. Thanks.

I can understand your point, but you still use them since now, and at the beginning I said you can send a can spare because we thought it was the problem.
You said you had to go deeper into that...

Please text me in private and we'll find a deal.

I don't want unhappy eskating customers.

Thanks

Doing my best to laugh about it.. 
At least I've got some damn strong $100 refrigerator magnets! !
This one was totally loose.. Just had to lift it out.
