I have been rocking an Ollin VESC 4.12 for almost 2 years now and I think I need to replace the capacitors, Could somebody help explain ripple Current?

And If these new Caps I found on Mouser will work as replacements?

Thank You

I did a bulk cap research few days ago. In a nutshell there are 3-4 important features you want to look for:
Impedance (ohms) is an indication of the obstacles to the flow of current to/from the cap; so the lower, the better.

Life time (hours): this one is obvious

"Ripple current" which should be called "resistance to ripple current" to avoid misundersanding: this tells you how well the non ideal capacitor handles the ripple current which is a bad thing; the higher the ripple current resistance, the better.

Considering these factors, EEUFR1J681L seems to be the best caps out there.

Thanks a bunch Bro! I will look into it, and hopefully this thread can help others in the future as well.
