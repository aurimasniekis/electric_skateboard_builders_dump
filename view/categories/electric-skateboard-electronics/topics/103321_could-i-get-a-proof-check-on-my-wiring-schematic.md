Hey everyone! This is my first DIY and I'd be very grateful if I could get some proof-checking on my wiring diagram. I'm going with a bypassed BMS.

Thanks so much!

Go to my profile. Click on the website link. You'll want to search the battery builders club once you're there :slight_smile:

I didn't. The fuse is right after the Battery Negative so it's always in play, whether charging or discharging.
