not to argue, but this will end up being able to handle 5kw of energy, 49V*100A..
I think you can use lower amps for each motor on your board :)

Hello there 
100A is definitely a overkill I weight 95 kg and never have pull more than 55A under any circumstances, if you want to have some headroom you can get a 60A or 80A BMS.

I can get 35 mph. 
The single will work good for hard surface like asfalt or hard terrain the plus is that  it will give you better range. 

For off road performance Dual is the way to go.

I have a brand new 100A 4-12S Turnigy SuperBrain ESC for sale in the US. I bought it as a backup and never used it.  PM me if interested

http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__10944__Turnigy_Super_Brain_100A_Brushless_ESC.html

Some of the cool features it has are an integrated data logger, which stores voltage, current, RPM, temperature, etc for your last 5 runs. It is intended for helicopters, but it is fully programmable and has adjustable brakes. My coworker uses one very similar on his e-board, and it works great. It's a rock solid ESC from what I have read

Well, The No1 EMTB Guy (@Nowind ) over here approved the Roxxys as good, so they are well tested (And Burned) in ESK8/EMTB Applications. If i was to upgrade to 12S, i would use these, as they are also tested with 8072 Motors.

Don't you need to link your ESC's if you are running with two motors?
