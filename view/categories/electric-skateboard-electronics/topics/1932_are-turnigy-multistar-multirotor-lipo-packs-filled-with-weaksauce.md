based on more evidence gathered yesterday evening, the higher amp hour (mine is a 16Ah) multistar multirotor packs by turnigy are definitely lacking a bit of oomph. At around 23 volts i topped out at 20mph on twin NTM 270kv 5060s using a 15/36 pulley ratio and a pair of Favourite 6S escs. My ESC settings are all maxed out basically.  

when i had an older Flier type 8S ESC in there with those two motors and the old custom 6S lipo pack in there, i was seeing close to 30mph consistently, and at one point i went over 31. When I had that pack in there with the Favourites, i was seeing similar results, usually topping out around 27 or 28ish. 

Do you think its something special with the multstars or is this just what 10C feels like?

And where is the amp rating listed on these packs? It makes it difficult to know what C is so i can figure out what 10C would give me. Burst is allegedly 20C on these packs. 

somebody actually commented on instagram about this too. I think @cmatson also had a build with one of these recently. What was the ride on that board like?

Yeah, of course the 10C isn't actually 10C.. supposedly otherwise I would think we'd get way more power from them.

Multistar are ok.. just not there for performance.

I like the 25-30C packs.. 20C is ok but 30C is better if it's a few bucks more..

But yeah.. so much for the Multistar packs :smile:

i'll have to look at my old pack, but i think it was around 45C. 

The range though. I mean DAMN. Yeah they only shove so much juice over the wire, but its there for the long haul. I'm going to do a full range test this weekend. I expect to get an assload of milage out of it, and if so, i think maybe these packs have a decent use case in long-range 15-20mph commuter boards. It takes forever to charge these packs though.

Well, i would just need an hour to charge these two lipos :stuck_out_tongue:
I would appreciate two tests with the exact same setup just other lipos! I cannot imagine that those multistar does not have enough power... they are rated at 10C. Your 16Ah (mine 8Ah) has a continous rating of 160A (mine 80Ah also enoguh?) and that is much more than needed! Correct me if i am wrong?

Well this is good info. I was just considering getting 2 10C Multistars to run in Series. I only pull 80A max, and they're rated for 100A constant (in theory) so I assumed they'd be OK. Maybe your pack is defective?

I was using a turnigy 8000mah 30c discharge pack, and it was pretty solid. 

No experience with multistar, so I can't really comment.

The lipos are underwhelmingly small. A 10ah multistar is much smaller than a 8ah zippy 

Both 6s just different c rating

@cmatson so that one build you did with the faceted fiberglass box on one of my decks wasn't one of these?  I thought it was. Oh well. 

Maybe it is defective though. They're no longer on sale, so i can't really justify buying another one, but i may try some zippys and see what happens. hmmm

For the most part, C ratings don't mean a thing because there isn't much of a widely used standard for them. Manufacturers calculate C ratings differently, and they are usually over exaggerated. Take a look into the confusion this caused in the multirotor racing world.

blargh. As soon as i decide on a 10S BMS with integrated soft switch, i'm going 26650s from now on anyway. This was just an experiment for shits and giggles. The boxes i'm having made for my Scarlet decks will be able to hold repacked high amp hour lipos, 18650s, 26650s, or multiple zippy types, plus twin ESCs and BMS to boot. Plenty of room for whatever you want in there while still looking sleek and sexy.

If it's a defect, it seems like it's a common manufacturer issue. More likely, it's what others are saying here, and have said many times before. The output on them is exaggerated. Considering it's not even a high output to begin with, they feel extra weak. This seems to have been reported in multiple threads on this forum alone by different users, and also on other forums with these Multi star packs. Same company makes packs that aren't as cheap and run better consistently. Right now it's all just anecdotal opinion based evidence, I haven't seen any official testing on them, but I would not be surprised if they are underpowered. They are cheaper then all of the other packs they make with similar/same ratings for a reason.

I run four 3S 5.2Ah Multistars in series and have never run out of oomph after I set cutoff limits correctly.
When riding, I cannot tell the difference from four 3S 5Ah Zippy's except for the longer range I get from the Multistars.

I havent tested mine yet. But I have run zippy 5Ah 20C cells in the past. (Which is funny because at the time every ine was rubbish talking them as well) So by my understanding 10Ah 10C cells should be the same output. I'll definitely report back.

if some how on a 6s set up you draw more then 75 amps yes other wise not really. the 45s can output 225A and the 20s 100 that extra amprage wont help you if you dont use anywhere near it.

I think when my new VESCs arrive i'm going to see how they behave with this pack vs the Favourites i'm currently running in there, just to rule out the ESCs as the weak link. ITs possible the issue is the ESCs, although i  thought it was acting slow before i blew out my second Flier due to the aging lipo i had in there. 

There are just so many variables in my set up to really determine this. I would need two identical builds to really experiment with this properly, which would involve me have identical decks, which i have, and identical boxes which i don't have and would have to fabricate, then identical drive systems which i could have by splitting my twin 6355s on my scarlet prototype and having single 6355s on each of these test boards. 

hopefully my friend will be able to fab these composite boxes i need soon, been waiting for months now to get started on them.

i'm worried that would involve skating around on uncovered lipos due to the fact that my current boxes are built specifically for a given battery pack, but i suppose that multistar 16Ah 6S is about as big as a 6S gets, so maybe i could just swap them out if i got another one with twice the C rating and half the capacity that was about the same size. That seems to be their thing. Huge capacity or huge discharge rate... I want both goddammit. lol

So after doing a sort of hybrid range test/speed test last night, and documenting the whole thing in Map My Ride, i realized there is a very specific use case for this Turnigy Multistar 6S 16Ah pack: Commuting. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BDo6ZT9BBm1/?taken-by=longhairedboy

The Average Speed listed in the pic there is on the low side of what i was actually maintaining most of the time because it of course averages in slow downs for people, intersection crossings, passing people with dogs and kids, etc. But the vast majority of the time i was cruising at a very comfortable 18mph. For well over an hour and a half. 

From 25.1 volts to 20.1 volts i got 21 miles while maintaining around 18mph and frequently flooring it up to around 25, which seems to be the top speed of this board in its current configuration on a fresh charge. 

just to refresh your memory: this rat board is a dual drive with twin NTM 270kv 5060s, 15/36 pulleys, 9mm belts, twin favourite 6S 120amp ESCs, Turnigy multistar 16Ah 6S lipo, enertion mounts, flywheel clones with bones reds, and a 7ply Scarlet deck with custom fiberglass enclosures. 

on a smaller, lighter board, these parts may take you a little further, but i think this is a great sample of what these packs are made for: flight hours and not so much flight speed.

Ahh, gotcha. These are turtle batteries, not hare batteries. Thanks for the great report! And when you run out of battery, the bottom of your board looks like it would make a sweet fingerboard skatepark! 

I just picked up 4x 5000mah Multistars, and was going to wire them in parallel & series for a 10,000mah 6s setup. Hopefully the 10c rating will not be a limiting factor in that configuration. Can’t wait to find out what kind of range I get with this setup.

This pack i'm reporting on is 10c, but with four packs in the config you're describing, you should ultimately end up with an effective 20c rating because you are making two 10c packs in parallel. 

So you should see more top end than i am.

The 20c equivalent is what I’m going for. But if I understand this stuff right, the C-rating is related to the capacity of the battery, correct? So, you should still have a higher max discharge rate at 10c on your larger pack, but we shouldn’t actually pull anywhere near these amp levels anyway, right?

My situation (single motor): 10Ah x 20c = 100A max discharge rate 
vs.
Your situation (dual motor): 16Ah x 10c = 160A max discharge rate

Do I have this right?
```

That is correct.
However, I've been discharging my Multistars at close to their theoretical C rating and they don't like it. I'd say you need to apply a 30% 'reality'-margin at least.

Yes, and this whole c rating thing is seeming like a lie of many shades to me at this point. It's only useful as a vague reference as far as I can tell. 160 amps doesn't behave like this in my experience. I'm lucky if I'm seeing 80 or 100 by my gut guesstimate.

Wouldn't 10Ah x 20c  = 200A max discharge rate (not 100)?

So using the~30% rule practical application of ~140A

Just while we are here talking about C rating and multistar.

My zippy packs that I have always used are 20C.
The multistar pack I bought is 10C.

On that information alone you would assume that the zippy can output more current than the multi.

However half the equation is missing. 
The zippy is 5000mAh and the multi is 10000mAh so the are actually the SAME C rating on paper.

Ive found out why I hate(d)  multistar packs so much!  and it kind of makes me hate them a little less!

The solder connections keep breaking between the 2nd and 3rd cell and 5th and 6th cell.   Both of my packs did this same thing.  I had to take the whole damn thing in individual cells to figure out what it was. 

The reason the middle connections didnt break is because i did them.

I rode quite a lot during the last few days an my Multistar 3s 5.2Ah packs are really starting to suck.
One cell just died, the cell voltages are all over the place in the remaining packs.
But most importantly, I'm lucky if I get 3Ah out of them lately.
(My low cutoff is set to 3.6V because under that there [isn't much happening](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/loaded-dervish-dual-r-spec-6355-dual-vesc-nunchuck-paris-195-90mm-flywheels/524/62?u=trbt555).)

Hey Tom after I analyze my lipo packs an configuration abit, I found something very interesting.

I found that my longboard is better running with 50c rating compared to 25c rating. So I better off with  2 series and 2 parallels instead of all 4 in series.

I have to agree that higher voltage is cooler for motor and esc, but it gives alot of stress to the batteries. You have multistar with only 10c rating, connected them all in series. That means each acceleration pulling high amp close to the limit of each batteries could provide. Thats probably one of the reason your battery are down so quickly.

The power that is used or drain by motor is still the same in watt hours. If it doesnt stress the motor and esc, it stresses the batteries. Too low voltage put stresses in motor and esc. Thats something we have to choose.

I literally have double acceleration and more agressive ride when connected them in parallel.

I think if you want to keep the 12s format without parallel setup ( doesnt fit anyway on rosti mepal), you should try get those big capacitors and have them mounted. That should help reduces battery stress.

Otherwise get the graphene battery and test them. It has 45c or 65c rating which is great to reduce battery stress when only 1 pack is used.

You can load 4 3s 4000mah 65c in that box. Thats the best Ive seen by far with turnigy graphene setup inside rosti box.

Its known that caps can help reduce cogging or stress during short burst discharge. This already help improve battery life during starting standstill or small acceleration.

It could also be that the low voltage cut off was too low everytime. But batteries die quick is always because of too much stress. This possibly have an impact to your vesc heating up. Strange that my esc doesnt even heatup while you're with vesc+ heatsink have heat issue. Theres something wrong somewhere.

Yeah right. Please allow me to serously doubt that statement.
Please calculate for yourself how many amps a 2200uF cap can produce when discharged over an inducance like a brushless motor and report back.
Let's not have newbies reading this thread get the wrong idea.
Capacitors over the battery leads are there to smooth out spikes in the voltage due to high frequency switching, not to provide amps when the battery can't.
If someone can prove the opposite using the laws of physics, please do and I'll adjust my opinion.

LOL yeah @Michaelinvegas they are called capacitors.

@trbt555 its not the caps alone, but the caps in conjunction with the batteries.
caps can discharge quite a lot of amps in a short time and then charge back up just as fast, this is why they are useful.
a cap by itself will run high current for like a split second.
so no it physically cant run the motor alone, but when a battery is connected in parallel across the caps the battery can recharge the cap with as much current as the battery can provide. 

it is only a short burst of current, but it does help.

do you know why a cap helps with ripple? because it can soak up high current spikes very quickly. (you know the arks when you hook them up?)  they also do the opposite.  you would be pretty naive to think that caps could be connected in parallel with a battery and not have some of the energy sucked out of them when the motor draws it.

Hi Tom you're the physics man, theres no doubt that the caps wont help much within current draw as current is provided by the batteries anyway. But I meant int he previous comments was the surges, especially during startup. It smoothen out the power draw. I personally use 10000uF caps in addition from the VESC caps and or esc caps. Theres huge spark when connected without antispark.

Thats why I recommend to add parallel connections to the mutistar batteries. You can try and compare them if it works better or not compared to the all series connections.

I don't want to be the wise ass here but as a scientifically educated person I feel I can sometimes help people understand how things work and why they work or don't work. There's no hocus-pocus involved.

Assume you have approx. 2200uF in caps in parallel over your battery leads, which is a typical setup in a lot of cases. 
Now let’s consider a fully charged 12S system: when charged at 50V, these caps can store 2.75 Joules of energy, you can look up the equation if you like.
Suppose you want to accelerate uphill and your weaksauce-filled-Multistar-pack voltage sags to 40V, your caps will discharge 0.99 Joules of energy.
Let’s say the voltage sag takes only one second:  0.99 Joules expended over 1 second corresponds to 0.99W of power (Power is Energy over Time) available to your system.

At 40V that equates to a whopping 25mA additional current during that ONE second.

Call me old-fashioned but that just won’t cut it.

So: I agree that caps help smooth out voltage ripple (which is in the millisecond range) but I stand firmly by my statement that they will NOT help with a battery that can't cope, and we shouldn’t be leading people to believe so either.

(EDIT: thanks to @DerBrecher for pointing out a small error in the energy calculation which is of course quadratically related to voltage)

Another thought: if you have room for a giant cap, then you have room for a longer cell, and longer cells have more amps. Assuming you're running prismatics, which is what we're talking when we say zippys and multistars.

Caps help with surges only very small, so only during those initial acceleration. It has nothing to do when you already hill climbing for more than lets say 1 second. It all goes back to the batteries performance.

By further eliminating the surges, it should help expand battery life (not significant, but trying to rule out the options to fail faster).

The main problem is that you don't have enough C rating / discharge capability. It stress too much your battery. You could try use those 45c / 65c rating lipo. Even if you don't draw that much current as what the lipo could deliver, by not having it discharge near 100% / max rating, it would help alot with the life cycle. This is one of a few reasons why I want to get the graphene. I could do 12s setup but still have the power burst. High discharge capability boost the startup like crazy in my point of view.

Yeah, my caps will cover that initial 25mA surge the first second I accelerate. That really makes a difference :smirk:

Anyways, my Multistars are rated 10C, which corresponds to 52A continuous current draw capacity.
I'll be nice and subtract 30% CSI (Chinese Spec Inflation), which gives me 36A continuous.
According to my power meter my _peak_ current draw is always less than 30A and still the Multistars don't seem to like it.

Mind you, there's no tell-tale puffing, just diminished Ah capacity and wonky cell voltages.

Well, 
Today I made some test runs

I have multistar 8Ah 6s2p and a 213kv motor (max 10s @ 60A).  So i have set in the vesc Option Motor max 60A, battery max 80A and watched the live data with my Smartphone. It always stays at max 60A, because of the Motor max setting -.- but Hey, 60A comes from ~25A is not so  good. They are very slow but can reach topspeed and last quite  long.

My new Motor did arrive today. I need to change the Motors and retest it with 12S. At least the multistar batteries are well.... They are a bit slower  compared to zippys. But they are lasting  very long : about 20 km. 

Is it normal that it will always stay at about 22 Volt shown in the Screenshot (6*3,7V=22,2)? Fully charged they are at 6*4,2=25,2V
