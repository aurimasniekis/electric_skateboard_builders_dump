Hello guys, here is a small how-to tutorial on how to make a battery for the enclosures I sell. For those who don't have the time/tools to make it I'm also offering the enclosures with batteries.

There are different ways to make the batteries but this one is a good balance between price and level of skill. 

In this tutorial we will be making a 12s4p this is a really big battery for everyday use, you might have a range on 20-22 miles and a discharge capacity of 80A, that's A LOT, more than enough for me and for the 95% of esk8ters around. 

1. Buy your enclosure here :slight_smile:

2. Buy 48 Samsung 30Q cells, pretty good stuff. Install cardboard/fish paper rings for added security.

3. Glue them with hot silicone or even better natural cure silicone, use fish paper for the positive and negative terminals of each pack. Secure it with kapton tape

4. Spot weld 99.9% nickel strips using this technique and shape

5. Connect the nickel strips using 2 x 16awg wires

6. Glue adjacent packs together, don't forget to use fish paper between them and then use 200mm heat wrap to cover each double pack

7. If using a BMS cut small holes on the heat wrap and solder the balance leads, cover them with kapton tape. 

Enjoy!

No room for a Bestech 80a bms and 2x vesc, receivers and BT module ?

Unfortunately it seems you won't be able to fit the Bestech 80A BMS, only the Battery Supports 12S 60A.

It's going in a hs11 deck for Taliesin, I'd suggest he gets a BMS for charging

@Eboosted I'm completely new with this, so might be a stupid question, but if I understand your previous post correctly, you can't have two VESCs and a BMS in this? So you can't have two motors and a "laptop-style" charger with this setup? If so, how am I supposed to charge the batteries?

You can charge with a laptop style charger whether you have a BMS or not. However for you I'd suggest you get a Battery Supports BMS which fits perfect along with 2 FocBoxes or a Bestech BMS for charging like the HCX-D122

I have the HS11 enclosure and have this 12s 60A BMS which just fits in with my 2 VESC6s

fish paper
[/quote]

this is a great guide though i do have concerns for safety with those wires being pinched against the enclosure and deck. after some time they will start to break and could cause a short.

i am actually after an enclosure like this though the wiring is really concerning.

Could someone please reply with the enclosure dimensions so I can see if it will fit my non-Trampa mountain board?  I'd love to put this on the bottom of my MBS atom.  How flexible is this enclosure?  thanks in advance!

Hello i have noticed in your post that you can build the battery packs as well. I am looking to buy a battery pack for trampa board to fit their monster box. 12s4 or 5p with BMS. Is this something you could help with? If so are you able to ship to UK?

I am a huge fan of this enclosure over the bulky monster box. However, being new to building, my concern is actually installing this on my trampa pro belt board. Maybe I missed it, but I did some googling/searching and I couldn‚Äôt find a build guide to actually install the enclosure and connect the batteries. Any info on the process would be much appreciated!

Thanks for the quick response! That looks pretty straight forward and it definitely addresses most of my concerns. As for moving the two VESC out of the monster box, what is the recommended procedure there? I apologize for my lack of knowledge and experience if that‚Äôs a well documented or an obvious/easy process.

If you intend on using your Trampa for off road, I suggest you stay with a top mounted enclosure like the monster box.

Taz is correct! ‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è I have some nice scratches in the bottom of my trampa deck and trucks from hitting rocks and who knows what else. If my battery was on the bottoms I could see it going through the thinner material of the enclosure pretty easily!

That‚Äôs totally valid. I didn‚Äôt really consider that. I kinda figured the enclosure would withstand light abuse. I‚Äôm definitely going to be focusing on trail riding with varying levels of rocks and debris. As my progression increases it could get gnarlier I guess haha. Makes my life easier to keep it as is. Thanks for the heads up.

So I have just built this battery pack. My question is can I split the output wires into Ys for the charging wires?
This is what I have done, but it instantly fried my charger.
