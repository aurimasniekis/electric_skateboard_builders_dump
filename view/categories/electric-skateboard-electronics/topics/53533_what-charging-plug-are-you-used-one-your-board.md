Really...

Man, like I said. Solder close to the plastic with thick guage.

The jack is designed for thin guage to be put through the eyelets and soldered. Don't use the eyelets. Use 16ga and push it up to the plastic. And solder it. This makes only a very small section thin. That small section can hold quite a few amps.

I wouldn't worry about the V at all unless the terminals come SUPER CLOSE, I even think these can be used up to like 70v honestly.

The amps is what you should be worried about most, and it can handle that just fine

## \#32 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-04-26T04:08:35.930Z Reads: 129

They can, as long as you use thick guage wire, so the resistance across the wire and the small jump off the panel mount is very low. 

A thin resistive wire on these tiny things will of course pop...

I think in his case melting off a tiny bit of plastic would expose a thicker tab right?

No need. Just solder as close as you can to the plastic without melting it.

I've used these panel mounts from 8-13s.. like in the pictures above. (54.6v 6a)

I always use them, and I always use 16ga wire because the thicker wire lowers the resistance. Which also prevents the wire from heating which in turn keeps he connector cool.

Push 325watts though a wire designed to go in the keyhole (22/24ga) your gonna deal with wire, and connector heat and it will pop.

It's all about resistance over distance and diameter.

325 watts? Goddayum, I only push around 200 watts.

@Devilmycry You're only pushing around 200 watts aswell, this'll work for you definitely

Just make sure to use thick wire, 16ga is the thickest I can solder on to the insides of the legs with them not touching, and still slide it through the panel mount hole I make for it. 
I'd stick to 16/18ga and you should be fine.

XT30 with 3D printed panel mount is a great alternative, comply to high charge current and is nearly invisible.

This is not because the port can not handle more volt but because of safety regulations. The contacts are easily reachable for small fingers and objects so more than 30v which can not harm a human, is forbidden. 50v is already in a range that is considered hazardous to humans. So as long as you keep your toddler away from the port you can go to 230v without anything happening to the connector.

5a is really not that much current especially over the short lengths inside a board. I'm too lazy to look it up but I'd be surprised if 26ga wasn't good enough electrically. 16ga is overkill (not a bad thing).

Quick sanity check would be to check the wire gauge of the cable coming out of the charger.

Personally I'm running 18ga for the charge port, because the next smallest silicone wire I have is 22ga, and I wanted it to be physically tougher than 22ga.

On another note, I'm using XLR, which is a bit bulky. I'm thinking though, to use one connector for 10s boards, and a different one for 12s, so I don't make that mistake (boom). Most likely I'll only have 10s and 12s builds.

EDIT

3 pin XLR is kinda nice. It's typcally used for microphones, for which phantom power is 48v. I believe the pins are good for 10a easy.

Some specs here:

http://www.switchcraft.com/Documents/switchcraft_sealed_xlr_npb_604.pdf

FWIW the pdf says 24awg -> 4a, 22awg -> 6a. pdf also says 500v rms, but rms means AC, so must de-rate heavily for DC.
