RipTide Sports has come up with a way to make Urethane conduct heat without conducting electricity.  The compound is almost as heat efficient as Aluminum at half the weight and can be molded!   We are looking for applications, any ideas?  A couple of concepts we are considering are outrunner and direct drive sleeves to protect and bleed heat off the motor and battery holders.  Conceptual photos are shown.![28|690x388](upload://2ZfxJi9pO24x6dDpWS6PI5PQ0Bm.png) ![40|690x388](upload://rPKAWyvkwVEmjY9EgvaoMWEM91I.png) ![15|690x388](upload://mjdSjHoh8uLri3pLaIO8zBME4sn.png)

Oh wow, those motor sleeves would be a great idea. I’m sure there can be tons of stuff.

Focbox sleeves too!

Yeah this would be great for different sized motor cans! 

I think thermal pads in general are already readily available for cheap enough in all sorts of sizes... But a vesc, focbox, unity screw in mount? That would be cool @Skunk. 

I love the idea of battery isolating heat sinking urethane. I think the killer would be space though, so even a small modular stackable sleeve similar to what's pictured, but tighter stack would be awesome. Something that can work between single or double, like what's pictured..
 Maybe hexagonal interlocking sleeves with cuts for nickel strips and balance wire routing? 

@Alphamail, how about thermal mass? Thermal conductivity similar to Aluminum? I'm not a heat dissipation engineer, but with similar conductivity, is this new formula able to absorb a lot of heat and dissipate it like aluminum or is it more like a good conductor like a thermal pad and not so much meant for the dissipation of heat by itself, or? 

This is super cool. When testing the TB DDs, they did warm up quite a bit... I'd totally be down for some finned motor can sleeves for both abrasion resistance for the motors and heat dissipation, and/or some covers somewhere on the hangar itself to dissipate additional heat there. I was considering some extra small heatsinks applied with thermal adhesive on the flat spots on the hangar for when I get my DDs, probably not though cause that's janky. If we had a purpose made heat dissipation sleeve though...

The tests I have done are fairly basic but indicate the compound is about 70% of what an Aluminum piece of the same size conducts.  As for shed speed, I have not been able to test that.   I am thinking making some simple parts to test in real world applications would speak volumes for go or no go!

Is there a data sheet?  Commercially available? I’ve never heard of something that conducts heat that well but not electricity that isn’t a metal.  They seem to go hand in hand. Or else have crap physical qualities and a filled resin.  
It would be great to be able to roll the heat away onto the road.  For the tire core more so needed resistance to deformation under stress and heat.

Id say to try motor sleeves to seal popular motor sizes.  This market is MUCH larger than either DD or hub.

It should be trivial to see the motor temp difference with and without sleeves.

@Alphamail is the compund clear or opaque?

Worth a test

At the same time...

It might make a lot more sense to make a sleeve that would be good for standalone motors or DD.

I want a sleeve that seals for selfish reasons.  

If you're going to test this out I'd try to make sleeves to fit the majority of motors out there.

instead of doing lines sideways maybe you can do lines vertically, that way it looks more natural. also some inspiration from carvon

the black part is their custom urathane sleeve for the coolwheel hubs :joy:

as long as it doesn't trap heat and it protects the motor can aganist minor impacts it would be solid.

I don't know what you've decided on, but I think  a mold that fits the 63mm diameter of the most used motor cans, but having it slightly longer than the length of a 6374 would allow you to cut the excess length from the sleeve to match every variation of 63mm motor without needing to discard too much material.

For a motor sleeve, given the thermal transfer properties of the urethane would be comparatively less efficient than the motor can metal itself, this would suggest that the sleeve should be only thick enough to provide physical protection (from stones and other debris). 

By this reasoning it would suggest that the motor sleeve should be as thin as possible.

I would agree if unfinned but since the finned surface area could easily be 2x to 4x of the motor can multiplied by .7 efficiency makes the heat drain 1.4 to 2.8 to times better than the unsleeved motor unless thermodynamics do not work the way I am thinking.

## \#58 Posted by: MasterSpoon Posted at: 2019-04-04T04:40:42.971Z Reads: 168

A consideration if your looking at finned vs unfinned in surface area is that fins running the length not circumference of the motor can will create turbulence and likely some low pressure area's which presumably would have some reduction in thermal conductivity at that point.

Not sure if something like an airfoil design on the lengthways fins might help

What’s TCV?
Pu is normally a thermal insulator but your saying you have come up with a version with conductivity almost on par with aluminum and half the weight.  I’ve looked and found papers where doped with carbon Pu has shown better strength, which is surprising, but how do u get almost as thermally conductive as alum?  How do u know?

I’ll try it!  Or test it.  What’s the tensile strength after doping?

Good morning, here was my test setup.   
1.5" thick samples placed on a hotplate and the temp differential between the surface closest to the heat source compared to the surface furthest away from the heat source after 30 seconds and one minute then averaged.  As an example, if the heat source side was 200 and the side furthest away was 100, I call that 100/200 = .50 expressed as a percentage is 50%

Data:

Aluminum block:  69%

Untreated Urethane:  29%

5% load Urethane:  39%

10% load Urethane:  57%

10% load / Aluminum is 57/69 = .83 expressed as a %, the 10% loaded material is 83% as efficient in transferring contact heat as Aluminum at 1/2 the mass.

Going by your results unfilled pu is 42% as efficient at transferring heat as aluminum.  That can’t be right.   That would make the Pu more thermally conductive than most metals. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.engineeringtoolbox.com/amp/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html

 Alum is super conductive and regular Pu is a super insulator.   Finding even a highly filled resin for thermal transfer, like stycast epoxy or there’s some conductive silicones but data sheets show they are maybe 1/30th as conductive as alum and they costs a fortune.

Do you have a picture of your setup Brad? I think Hummie is right as there is something going on with the experimental setup

By what you said the main culprit would be radiation and convection heating up the top of the samples, so you aren’t measuring the conductivity alone, but the sum of the three mechanisms of heat transfer

As with anything, proof is in real world applications so if you have one in mind put it out there.  If my numbers are right or close, the additive may counteract other desirable characteristics of the base material rendering it useless for the application so all we can do is give it a go.

Haha. I feel on the forum we’re in the age of search and not do.   U make it happen and I want it.  But I’ll take any resin or solid stuff u will send.  For anything.  I’m curious about how ur Pu performs.  I think with the powered boards all putting leverage on the pivot cup n bushings they get eaten up.  And I can’t stop mine from squeaking!  Tried soap chips  liquid soap. Oil.  All kinds of oil.

I got some thermally conductive silicone to make phase wires and was bummed how weak it was and wasn’t doable safely.  But with the adding of carbon fill it’s encouraging that instead of weakening it strengthens.  Seems anything will be possible.

I’ve tried nothing and only swapped out standard Paris stuff for some of a bunch of unknown harder yellow ones I got from skates on haight for free.  You know the lady who works there?  But one day with all my thinking about it I’ll have to do some blind testing.  Maybe three turns of the wrench for all and the variables are gone 

But how can I get rid of these squeaks now?

What type of mold can you use for it ?how much temp does it need to withstand ?

Super compound btw, I see many applications for it!

Love to try it.   Fantastic. I’ll ask aend if they’re willing to send one or I’ll go down there and get one.   Or maybe we could try a 90mm wheel. Not a fair challenge as what I have is 84mm and I think 78a. I hope ur tire rocks!!  I’ll make a mold.

U know with aend and I think Everywhere they require big orders and my pouring of hot Pu from Anderson development probably took a year off my life and it was really awful in essentially my kitchen.  If we can find stuff that works of course that’d be a great potential.   I can 3D print another 84 wheel n make a silicone mold bout 50a.  Two part mold.  Another option aend was using the motor as the mold.  Either way I’ll make it and get back to u.  Thank you.

I don’t see what u mean by open cavity on the web.  I never went to see what aend does but want to. 

Here’s one.  It now stores random metal bits n have to crack out some resin at the bottom ![image|375x500](upload://r18s0L7Byt15cZTx4kxj92ytMrf.jpeg) 

An embarrassing mold.  Tons of silicone and I used silicone glue to add a reservoir after also hacking one out.   Before I’d just do even two small holes: one air n one for resin, and use a handheld vacuum from roarocket to suck it in quickly and was quick n reliable.

Ok u mean with an open top.  Unfortunately there’s a lip and need be two part mold I think. Or could alter the mold or make another one if u think it need be .

```
The mold material needs to be able to withstand up to 16 hours at 200F (93C) so it is best to make a 3d printed plug that you pour tooling urethane over, cure at room temp then remove the plugs and pour your production urethane in to mold parts.  The plugs and resulting mold are always sprayed with mold release to prevent the part from sticking to the tooling.

What do you think about using this thermal PU to make the bottom half of a FOCBOX case to replace the aluminum portion for testing purposes? Not that anyone would permanently replace this stock aluminum component, but I think the test would speak volumes to how this PU performs in a real ESk8 world application, side by side with the FOCBOX'S stock aluminum heat sink case. And maybe to take it one step further, make another case out of standard PU to test as a baseline for comparison to the thermal PU.

Would there be a way to simply get this in sheets? I feel like this would be perfect as padding and extra thermal mass both under ( and optionally over ) focboxes in an enclosure.

I feel like 1/16'' or 3/16'' x 6'' x 3'' would be a great size, that way it can cover most if not all vesc variations: 2x general 4.12, 2x VESC 6, 2x focbox

Surface area is a real bitch for us since it needs to fit inside specialized equipment, I might be able to design a vertical mold assembly to accomplish this like interleaved cards.  6" x 3" is a good size?  Any thoughts on a good duro to start with?  

Would it be useful to have molded in mounting holes at the corners?![heat%20sink%20pad|690x360](upload://iBvOtIsLZTYzUtoLAxZAlgHMw2v.jpeg)

Yeah, I think 6x3 would be the size most would use. 

I don't know much about duro and how that would impact heat properties... I think anything soft enough to provide good protection should suffice

I can't speak for everyone but I wouldn't have use for the holes.

The pad may be a dubious application if the pad is between the heat source and a wooden deck since the deck will not effectively bleed off the heat in the pad.  I still think the battery cell separator that  includes fins may still make the most sense.  In essence an alternate material for a finned aluminum heat sink than can be made into complex shapes with half the weight.

I agree I thought that there was some law of physics that requires thermal and electrical conductivity to be almost equal, but I'm thinking this maybe only applies to metals as materials like glass don't follow such a rule.

[quote="Alphamail, post:68, topic:89278"]
Data:

Aluminum block: 69%

Untreated Urethane: 29%

5% load Urethane: 39%

10% load Urethane: 57%

10% load / Aluminum is 57/69 = .83 expressed as a %, the 10% loaded material is 83% as efficient in transferring contact heat as Aluminum at 1/2 the mass.
[/quote]

going with my bad math that would have unfilled pu as 42percent as conductive as aluminum.  ...that would be as conductive as many other metals which isn't the case.  theres so many units of conductivity and the process of conductivity is confusing but if you were to have an unfilled pu that could conduct that much...that's unheard of.


a filled pu that is 83% as conductive as aluminum is far from anything ive seen

http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/thrcn.html

https://www.masterbond.com/properties/thermally-conductive-epoxy-adhesives

these filled resins show about 1/100th the conductivity of aluminum

heat in a motor will increase the winding resistance . ..increase by 50% from room temp 20c to a hot 200c (which it may be deep inside)
https://www.cirris.com/learning-center/general-testing/special-topics/177-temperature-coefficient-of-copper


I bought a bunch of indium metal that melts at 300f thinking try to pot a stator to transfer heat through holes and it could be great.  haven't gotten around to it and fear the winding enamel would crack and short, but maybe not and id vacuum in epoxy first.   indium at 86 w/m and it being shapeable, castable, it could be a huge plus.  except expensive pure and alloyed even .5% copper and cheap, its not as nice and soft for expansion of the windings.  it would cost like 50$ to pot a 53mm stator in pure indium, like .997.  just need to pot the whole thing and have it maybe even have some aluminum block attached while it cools and solidifies.   and 300f isn't really that hot, but theres some other low melt temp metals that have higher temps.   indium is pretty ideal though being soft. 

 im getting temp sensors.  there's 11k sensors on mouser whats good?
