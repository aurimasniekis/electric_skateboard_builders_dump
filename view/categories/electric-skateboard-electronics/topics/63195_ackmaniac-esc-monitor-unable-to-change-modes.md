Hi

I recently purchased a focbox and a Bluetooth module to go with it. I seemed to set it up correctly as it seems to monitor voltage, temperature and everything else correctly, however, I cannot change modes. 

Here is the screenshot, does anyone know what's happening? Thanks.![Screenshot_20180729-124518_ESC%20Monitor|243x500](upload://yLSaUx61vTSs0uGOB3KCOTMMvK8.jpg)

As I understand it you have to flash Ackmaniac's firmware onto your FOCBOX to make use of this feature.

```
Download Ackmaniac's modified VESC-Tool from this forum. Search his name and you'll find it.
