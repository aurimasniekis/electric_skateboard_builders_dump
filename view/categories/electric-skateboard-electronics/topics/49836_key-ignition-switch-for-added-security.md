I was thinking about ways to protect my Esk8 from getting stolen.  GPS is a good idea if your board is stolen, but that usually requires a subscription or they have ones that only work through Bluetooth, so not the best solution, still it isn't a bag idea.  Recently I saw a photo of a bracket that very cleanly mounts a female xt90 to the outside of an enclosure.  I thought if you were to place that before the on/off switch and use a loop key, that would be a nice way of preventing your board from being ridden off.  I was still thinking about that today and figured if I wanted to have a sort of key ignition switch, why not get an actual one? I did a Google search which came back with some pretty good choices. 

https://www.google.com/search?q=key+ignition+switch&client=ms-android-sprint-us&prmd=sinv&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwilhL3vjYDaAhVR9mMKHQA2AhUQ_AUIEigC#imgrc=_

This one is my favorite so far, but I think this would be really cool to have one of these installed so unless you have the key, the on/off switch wouldn't work.

Granted, someone could just take the board without riding it and then if they knew enough they could simply open it up and do some rewiring, but another thing I though was maybe instead of using common screws or bolts, etc... one could get a fastener that is one of those really unusual shapes that requires ordering the exact tool to open them.  Further, if you were to have the screw hole counter sink in a bit, you could cover up over the screws with a dowel or something similar which matches your board.  

Truly the best way to prevent someone from opening up your board would be to just seal it and make sure 100% everything is working, lol, but obviously that's not a good idea.  Something I just thought of which would be pretty cool, is, once again make sure everything is working perfectly, and let's assume this is a top side cover to the enclosure, well you could secure it down with the screws, and then cover over it with grip tape.  Since grip take is so cheap, this really wouldn't be too terrible of an idea in my opinion...  I dunno, what do you guys think??.

THis has been discussed at length...in the early days.  Here's the reason it wont work.  

Most of these switches use a single pin to hold the key in place when in the on position.  It will vibrate out of place within a few minutes and then the key will fall out and you will likely never notice as its so small.  Then you have a board you can't turn off.

Good idea though.

That's a good point, however the switch that I posted the picture of, it allows you to remove the key from either position of on or off, so that wouldn't be a concern anymore.

Give it a shot, it might not vibrate to goo :slight_smile:.  I bought a couple of on/off switches made for forklifts thinking they would be really robust...not so much.

So maybe just that first thing I mentioned about a loop key on the outside would be the simplest, best choice then?

I was thinking about that concept and my conclusion was they would unbolt it and just complete the circuit  the key was holding So really your best key is the remote but Again They can google how to replace remote, Probably would be very hard because pulsswidth settings would be different but again They could read Focbox and google that. but again another conclusion if they stole it they probably wont give it back anyway maybe then you could find it on craigslist. 
"Electric skateboard missing remote" :joy:

I don’t any need for this. I use loopkey to power on my board, but if I don’t lock it on the post or somewhere you can just carry it away. Or if u leave it locked in a post it’s probably smashed in the pieces when you come back.

I have never had a e-switch on a Bestech BMS fail, but I just had my first Bestech BMS failure.  So yesterday I would have said either BMS E-Switch or Loop Key, but I'm thinking Loop Keey is the go to solution at this point.  I've never had one fail, the only danger is if you do not fully insert the XT90's plug, than can cause chaos.

I like the remote idea.  Perhaps you could have the key switch put in the remote.  Lol, you would have double security that way haha :wink:

Nah Dude Just nano remote fits in your pocket easy.
Maybe just maybe you could somehow you could program the stupid extra buttons to do a unlock pattern.

Or the other option

- keep your eyes on the board
- give the remote to no one. Yea that's right, I don't let anyone ride my board. But I also have no desire to ride anyone elses. 
- lock up your board, I leave a bike lock at work under my desk that the board gets locked to when I go to lunch
- Board goes in trunk of car to not be sen when it's in the car.
- riding in sketchy areas, if you wouldn't stop on a bike for people, don't stop for people on your eks8. 

I really don't understand how people get their boards stolen, without themselves being careless and it being their own fault...

The only time this should be possible is when it is not in your possession such as LHB shipping boards. Otherwise, it's your's to take care of, your's to pay attention to, your's to not get stolen.

What I love about esk8 when you need to stop by a shop to buy a drink and something to eat that fits your backpack You can take your esk8 in, Unlike bikes OH how many times have I seen bikes with 1 wheel stolen. or a broken bike chain. Oh and never give your esk8 to police they think if they confiscate it They get dibs LOL.

Oh I never leave my board anywhere, it always goes with me, I guess this is me just being over protective and adding more hassle to the build that isn't necessary haha.

I would not touch a board with something hissing inside.

If someone did steal my board from me while I was riding, I would eagerly wait for them to street their face with no protective gear.

Not many people are used to 200+ motor amps, if you can get my board from me, without me headbutting the shit out of you with my helmet, and manage to get away with my board, I will likely find you on the ground in a few feet.

Just make it so it runs fine without the key, but after a random amount of time (1 to 5 minutes) it shocks the deck with a taser or just randomly locks up the brakes, especially when speeds are higher it's more likely

Why on earth are you not on top of the board when you go to lunch?  Serious question...

Depends on the day, if I have lunch meetings that involve more then myself... Don't wanna look like a circus boy with the burmuda triangle with people in my shoulders..Happens when you drive people around - or ride with others. 

Most of the time I use the board around campus for meetings in different buildings and the in-house Starbucks across the street...which is why I'm building the potato because the Vanguard and Evo were to heavy to lug around work for coffee/meeting purposes. And esk8 to work 40~ miles away is a no go lol.

Wouldn't it be safer if you had a female port instead of a male port? The male port pins have a lot more exposure making it prone to receiving accidental connections.

It's isolated I wouldn't worry. If the xt90 failed you likely have Bigger issues...

[/quote]

For loop keys, it's better to put the male on the board and make the key from the female.  It makes the key more robust and the resistor is in the key so if you accidentally burn it up you don't have to take the board apart.

But normally, you are correct.  The hot connector should usually be female.

Tile says its new Slim device is as thin as two credit cards stacked on top of each other. Its actual dimensions are 54 x 54 x 2.4mm. An average credit card is nearly exactly 54mm wide and 0.76mm thick. So while Tile claims the Slim is as thin as two stacked credit cards, it’s probably closer to three.

> Along with the introduction of the Slim, Tile is launching its Tile Smart Location Platform, which will let developers and manufacturers build Tile into their own Bluetooth products

Sorry for replying to such an old topic, but what were the symptoms of your failure?  I have had a failure too where 2 parallel groups of cells were being discharged by the D140 bms to really low voltages.  I'm sure that is what used to cause the failures of my zippy Li-pos before I upgraded to li-ion packs.

Now I am having an issue where my new discharge only BMS from BKB doesn't appear to be balancing at all.  All the cells are within .5v, but when I leave it charge for 24 hours and check the voltages, I notice no difference in the voltage of the cells.  The high cells are still around 4.21-4.22 and the lowest cells are still around 4.17v  I just wish I knew how to test the BMS using a multimeter to figure out exactly what is going on.

A long while ago I used a remote with an spdt relay to sorta do the same thing! It never broke while I had it in but I had to take it out because the combination of buck converter + relay took up too much space and made me always worry about draining my battery if I left it off for too long... 

(Pls ignore the mess it is super clean now) https://youtu.be/y9K4LMhfj8Y

My failures were all switch related, I've had 2 10s and a 12s BMS switch die I the last year.
