Anyone know what type of connector it is? My DIYeboard connector from my motor is too small. Thanks

JST PH 2mm pitch

That's the one I bought for my sensor wire and Hm-10. Then I just spliced the wires together

How long it took for them for shipping ? 
I'm still waiting for mines to be shipped but order says in process and it's been about a week

Came within a week I think. I ordered it during the focbox dilema so I wasn't that concerned about the connectors
