In case anyone wou;ld like to know the difference between both motors in a real world test a video can say more than a thousand words:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boBT9NsGcUc

Dual 6374 brakes are much better
6355 230KV motors have more final speed than 6374 190KV
6374 motors do not use as much battery as I though
6355 are way lighter
6374 torque is really impressive, unfortunatelly you can not illustrate accurately how fast they are in comparison on a 6355 on this video, but believe me (Trump voice) they are way faster

Nice post bro!
I'm getting ready to set up a pair of 200kv 6374's and your report is very encouraging. 
Just one question, are you running 10s or 12s?

From slower to faster:

**Single 6355**:
- Lame braking, slow acceleration, but once you gain speed it accelerates acceptably faster
- Cheapest setup

**Single 6374**:
- Better acceleration that 6355
- Good final speed
- You can't accelerate very fast because it pulls you to one side because of having only one wheel drive and high torque
- $20 more expensive than single 6355 but way cheaper than any dual drive

**Dual 6355**:
- Perfect for the city
- Amazing acceleration
- Acceptable weight
- You don't need any special hanger to fit dual 6355 motors, just regular caliber or Ronin
- Love the 230KV motors on 10S (never exceeded 60000ERPM)

**Dual 6374**:
- Pulls A LOT!, but not is a way that make it difficult to ride, but a really powerful way with loads of control
- You can commute way faster because braking is more powerful, so you feel safer going at higher speeds
- As you ride faster all around, it becomes more dangerous but at the same time you feel safer because of better braking.
- The acceleration on full throttle requires you to lean yourself to the front a lot, after a couple of days your balance is spot on, you feel you don't need to lean as much as at the begining
- The sound of dual 6374 on BLDC is addicting, sounds like a freaking jet turbine!
- You don't use as much battery as one could thing because you don't use your 6374s at fullcapacity all of the time, just on long free/safe roads, so at the end it uses almost the same amount, maybe a tad more, than dual 6355.

Amazing explanation man! Do you know how good (or bad) is the breaking with single 6374?
This is really my only concern , and I'm scared that it won't work well especially in an urban environment

I'm runing 12S4P on the Trampa, so it has mora capacity and more speed. It's really not that comparable against the dual 6355 on 10S but you can at least feel the difference.

You will always feel a little drift on the Motor side. It is pushing or braking that you have to counter balance this Force. But after The time u will get used to it. 

But i would recommend dual!

Wow this thing moves! I'm guessing the lower speed acceleration is on another level compared to the 6355. Then at the top end these run out of steam and the 6355 shine?

Trying to figure out what I'm going to do. I really would like a torque monster that could still do ~28 or so :)

You'll likely be satisfied with just the torque from a dual 6355 or 5065 build. 6374 is a bit overkill for non-mountain boards and for everyday riding.

I can't see why 6374s would have less top speed than 6355s.
If anything, the extra torque should help to achieve more top speed unless they are not the same KV.
You could also go with higher gearing with 6374s to achieve more top speed.

I'm not sure about that, my dual 6374s are amazing, the acceleration is addicting, the braking is much better, the torque from low speed is just satisfying and smooth, the battery doesn't decrease that much on 12s4p. 

However, the prices will rise, for instance the 50.4V charger would be more expensive than a regular 42v charger, the 12S BMS is more expensive as well, you will need to run 15mm belts minimum, there are not much wide truck options, the weight of the board will increase and portability would suffer, so not everything is perfect with the 12S

I'm in the process of setting up a dual 6374 200kv 10s system with 15/40 gears and 9mm belts and 90mm wheels.
I've had good success running this setup with dual 6355 190kv motors.

Been running the 9mm belts with dual 6374â€™s for some time now and no problems.

Depends on how heavy your ass is.

My dual 6355 runs with two 12mm belts and itÂ´s ok - wish i could go up 15mm for harder brakes but i wouldnÂ´t go with 9mm. I expect 9mm to have too much wear for me.
But everyone without high mountains or heavy asses should be ok with 9mm.

If you wanna boost up your engine make sure to boost up your gears too.

So dual 6374 would be 15mm at least for me!

Is there any possible way that you could post a complete list of what all you are running on your setup? I'm relatively new to the eboarding but come from a background in technology and I've built dozens of drones. I have a pretty good understanding just need to know the specifics and where to source from. 

For examply it looks like the trampa board is a UK manufacturer and am not sure if you can get them shipped from within the US (where I live). 

Also i see kits vs buying the blank deck and trucks. Not sure what would make the most sense. 

I'd REALLY appreciate it!

Honestly most people would probably be satisfied with dual 5055's. To say that you won't be satisfied unless you go 6374 is a bit much. I'm sure the acceleration and braking is stronger, but at the same time i can stop on a dime on my dual 6355 and 5065 builds as well. 

Enthusiasts and those looking for raw power will enjoy dual 6374's. The average consumer or builder likely won't utilize all that extra torque.

I'm currently 195 lbs and I go up and down steep hills with my dual 6355 and 9mm belts. 
I've yet to break a belt even after picking rocks out of them numerous times. 
I'm not one to slam on the brakes at 20+ mph
I try to anticipate the need for brakes. 
I like narrow belts because of reduced drag which lets me use less throttle.

I'm 180 and live in SF with hills-a-plenty. The sheer pressure on one belt while accelerating/braking puts too much strain on 9mm belts here in SF, much more so than on dual drives, which is probably why they're breaking so much.

With single 9mm I had so much drag because I had to tighten so much for it to even stop me so it broke in the first couple days. 15mm single works okay for cruising but still slips on heavy braking. On my dual motor with dual 15mm it skipped teeth like crazy when trying to stop from +30mph. I have now added idlers to that setup and doesn't skip at all anymore. So if you're lighter 9mm may be okay but 15mm is more reliable and has less drag for the same amount of brakes from my experience

We ship everywhere! We do offer nice 6364 118kvand 136KV motors, top spec copper, magnets, stator, bearings, shaft. No compromise...
They are perfect for 12S and perform just as good as a standard 6374, since they produce more torque as the higher KV rated 6374.
The power on a dual is insane.

I run my belts as loose as possible for minimum drag and I got a little skipping with sudden hard braking or braking hard downhill. That was with 15/36 gears. 
Then I switched to 15/40 gears  and snugged my belts up just a little and that has just about eliminated the skipping all together.

I too have a single sensored 6374 with 10s3p and a 15mm belt. I'm 6ft tall and probably around 215-220lbs with all my gear on including a backpack. It is really my daily commuter (when functioning).

Acceleration is good except at the crest of the hill I must traverse on the way to work near the end of my commute. I'm not sure if it is voltage sag, the VESC overheating, or the sensors telling the VESC to chill out. I want to get another sensored 6374, and either a couple FOC boxes or if I suddenly become independently wealthy, a couple of VESC 6.0s to solve this problem. I definitely have to lean in even with only one motor when accelerating both at low and high speeds, because the 6374 has terrific torque. I'm sure having two motors will feel incredible, and will help me pull up some mountain passes when I next have to visit Norway this autumn. With the one motor I also feel the torque steer, but it isn't too great that it feels unsafe.

Braking is good, but the battery isnt wired up correctly or something and so overcharge protection kicks in regularly if I brake too much and I have to bail (no bueno). I plan on getting a new battery sometime soon that is travel safe and wired correctly with the BMS(s) to remedy this. 

I have wondered what the difference would be between dual 6374s or something else, and this thread basically helped me make up my mind. So thanks!

with a 10s3p, it could be voltage sag causing you to trip the low voltage protection on the vesc. Especially if the problem is at the end of your commute when your battery is somewhat depleted already.

A dual setup would help ease the stress on motors and vescs but it will not help the battery.
And a dual setup will only benefit if the battery is up to the task.
You might want to consider upgrading your battery before adding another motor and vesc.

@Namasaki  You`r still happy with those batteries ?

I saw your topic the other day, and was thinking if this was the battery for my upcoming Trampa urban carver build ?? On dual sk3 6355 or 6364(haven`t decided yet) 10s1p. What do you think ?

According to Hobbyking, they measure 25mm in height, and the trampa battery enclosure is 27mm.... So this could do :slight_smile:

I'm still using them and l am still very happy with their performance.
If your only needing medium range 10-12 miles and want a compact battery with a lot of punch and very little sag, then it's a good option in my opinion.

NOTE:
My riding is mostly recreational and less than 10 miles.
A lot of hill climbing though.

ya, it's hard to beat the price. Also if you register on Hobby king and log in you get a better price than if you shop anonymously.
And always check batteries that you get for Hobby King before doing anything with them.
I ordered 4 Zippy's once and 2 of them had a dead cell right out of the box.
I contacted HK though and sent them a pic of the batteries with voltage meter showing the bad cell and they promptly shipped me 2 new packs.
They did not want me to return the bad packs.

I know,  i've been in to drone racing for the last two years. So i know hobbyking very well :slight_smile:
One of the best batteries to fly racing quads with (my quads pulls over 100 amp on full throttle) is the Graphene serie Hobbyking has, they take a beating like no one else, with pretty darn low IR. But they are to big, to fit under the "trampa hood"

So, the one you are using is on backorder at the moment (EU) but i think i`m gonna buy them, when available again.

@Minim here is the difference on the 6355-6364-6374
 It is clear.

Huge cooper mass increase 

Now on the other hand between the 6355 & 6364 it is just too blurry IMO it is just the same motor in different dresses. 
Take a look.

Yes they can, and the motors just keep getting more and more powerfull. The bottleneck in drone racing, is the battery. Demanding that a 1,3 or 1.5amp lipo battery shall deliver 100amp sometimes is just crazy, and kill them pretty fast, Graphene seems to hold up best at the moment.

I think i just wait and se if they hit the EU store soon again. I dont want to pay taxes and fee.

The Samsung 30Q are rated at 15A but there is a guy that makes extremely reliable tests to every new battery coming to the market, the guy is know as Mooch and he makes all different kind of tests to analyze their capabilities. Google mooch test Samsung 30Q

So, to wrap things up, the Samsung 30Q have the same discharge rate than the 25R 20A

Yes indeed.

VTC4s can be used at 30A, but they might overheat. I would recommend runing it at 30A according to these tests. Everybody would rather run the cell at 20A in order to get better longevity of the pack, however if you run it at 20A why just not use the Samsung 30Q.

The only scenario I would buy the Sonys would be to be able to occasionally turn up the battery max on the vesc to 30A for short periods of time, maybe to compare your board against a competitor, or to show off, but why would you do that? I'd like a esk8 that runs consistently or exactly the same, always!

I read a lot about breaking belts here and different opinions on running 9mm belts single or dual. I have tried a lot of different belts on a lot of different setups. It seems nobody is taking into consideration the quality of the belts ...if you buy cheap stuff from China ( I am based in Taiwan btw) then you get what you pay for. If you go for something like strongbelt or gates then you do get top notch quality...and chances are greater for longer lasting rides ...just my two cents...

Anyone running at least 10s4p wont be drawing the full 30A from each cell (120A) continuous anyway. We can keep those settings and it likely won't overheat since we only pull about 20-30A on flats.

I have a few question for my build. 

Is there a thread someone there gives the rundown on all ESCS? I'm hearing a million terms thrown around/ scandals stealing names for VESC etc. etc. 

Anyone here used the vedder antispark that also has the power button on it? Seems like that would be a better solution that a key setup. 

How are you guys making the battery enclosure fully waterproof? Or is it not actually waterproof in some cases?

Thanks for the help!

If your wondering about the perforfance of a 6374, I have a single drive 12S system geared 20-32 so its a speed deamon.

it works really well at all speeds and accelerates very decently even up hill.  at medium speeds the acceleration is insane aswell as the breaking so I personally will never go with the smaller 55 even in a dual setup

Got my dual 6374's up and running. 
I am loving the feel of the extra wide wheel base with these @torqueboards 218mm trucks!
Using soft double barrel bushings  greased with soap for buttery smooth carving and the it feels amazingly stable. 
I do notice the increased torque over my 6355's although I am a bit conservative when it comes to acceleration. The brakes do feel stronger and it seems that when coasting, there is noticeably more drag than with 6355's due to the larger magnets. 
Going up the same 10% hill takes less throttle with the 6374's than with the 6355's. 
I am running 9mm belts and having no issues with belt skip or belts breaking.

How do you know you maxed out 6355s? Can you post screenshots after a ride if you have a phone app for both setups. I get bigger is more powerful but we're limited to what vesc and/or what 18650s can handle. So everything else being the same; kv, voltage, settings, gearing, wheels, rider weight, 100% throttle. So my question is are 6374s still faster, are the bigger motors more efficient?

I totally agree with this.  I think it depends on the settings of the motor controller.  I am rolling dual 6355's on vesc-x in FOC mode on my custom board, but my initial torque is no where near as strong as my bamboo GT.  We all know that the bamboo GT is just using 5065's. However at around 10mph or so, the torque is much stronger and would easily blow by my bamboo GT.

Do you two have the same settings and roughly the same rider weight. I can imagine that the 6374 are a bit more powerfull at the same amps. And by this they should be more efficient. But in theory if you pump 80 A in both motors the power needs to go somewhere. And if the 6374 are a huge difference then the 6355 must transfer a lot of the power in heat. But that is not the case in reality.

I guess the biggest difference is the higher resistance of the 6374 because of more copper length. Which gives you more power at low speeds. Because the duty cycle (volts) need to be higher to reach the same amps. And power is volt * amps. So with more volts for the same amps you reach a higher power. But that is then a bit of a disadvantage at higher speeds. Because close to the max duty cycle the power is less compared to the lower resistance motor.

Best would be to have have videos with my app to see the difference of the 2 motors. Sadly i don't think i will find the time in the next days to compare them.

Doesn't really seem to be a fair comparison. Running the 6374s at 12s 43.2Ã—80= 3,456watts. And 6355s at 10s 36Ã—80= 2,880watts. Eboosted you also mentioned 6355s are faster, but should be almost the same speed based on running at different voltages. With erpm at nominal voltage being 57,960 and 57,456 between the two. So seems like kv is not accurate or you're running different pulleys/wheels. Less gearing on 6355s means even less torque.

I agree with you about the voltage, I have run 12s and it creates substantial more torque than 10s in my opinion.
I am running my 6355s and 6374s both on 10s and though I can feel an increase in torque, it's not knocking my socks off.

Here is some prop thrust data from the Scorpion web site:

A motor with a shell diameter of **66mm** and a length of **70mm** ([SII-5535 190kv](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/catalog/aeroplane/motors_1/sii-55/S-5535-190KV/)) produces **12.4kg** of thrust with a AP*C 20x10 prop at **37v** (10s)/ **90.8A**/ 6430rpm.

While a shorter stator motor with a shell diameter of **66mm** and a length of **60mm** ([SII-5525-195kv](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/catalog/aeroplane/motors_1/sii-55/S-5525-195KV/)) produces only **9.2kg** of thrust with a AP*C 20x10 prop at **37v** (10s)/ **58.9A**/ 6450rpm.

While 2 motors are not statistically relevant and we are relying on what ever was Scorpion's test method, they do paint a picture. **At full gas the longer motor is pushing 1/3 more thrust and drawing a 1/3 more current/ amps at load.** 

I am surprised at ~6440/50rpm there such a difference. But the SII-5535-190kv is rated at 3900w/ 95A cont. while the SII-5525-195 is only rated at 2800w/ 80A. There is also a +198g  weight differance which is close to 1/3 of the weight of the SII-5525-195kv.

I would expect the difference between a 6374/ 6355 to be even greater as the difference in stator length is proportionately greater.

But its not all doom and gloom for the shorter motor, while the data pool is too small to say for sure it does look like it could be more efficient.

There are to many variables that are very different between the two. The way the throttle on vesc works also makes it hard to compare. If you make setting changes, then your throttle curve changes. And since you're controlling current/watts it's difficult to see how much power a motor has especially at slow speeds where you need lots of power. Compared to duty cycle like car ESCs have which sends all the power right away. Basically if you were to adjust your throttle curve so it's a ON or OFF switch to get all 3000+watts from a standstill it will feel like it has way more torque.

I removed the 6374s 190KV and mounted 6355s 190KV on my Trampa, everything else was left untouched, I wanted to compare for myself if the bigger motors were worth the weight and went to ride my daily commute.

I was expecting a lot less power and torque from the 6355s but I was impressed with them, the sound is more high pitched, the acceleration from stand still is a tad lower but not at all noticeable, at low to mid speeds the acceleration is almost identical when I was applying 3/4 throttle as I ussualy ride on that road, board felt light and smooth, the main difference was at full throttle from stand still, on my 6374s I need to be way thrown forward to avoid being thrown back at maximum throttle, on the 6355s it was a little bit more controllable and easy to ride, but the difference is not day and night. BTW I weight 154lb so make the math for your weight.

Thanks to @eboosted for spending all my monies. The torque on these is something you have to just experience. I pulled the front wheels off the ground while launching yesterday. To be fair it's probably due to me not being able to properly keep weight in the front as my weight shifted back. Me being skeptical as always I tried to replicate it to be sure. I got thrown off 5 times or so before I did it again. You hear a smack as the wheels come back down from being ever so slightly lifted up. I couldn't believe it (kinda still don't lol) ....

11 teeth on the motor pulley would make it tiny. More wear on the belt because of that and more prone to skipping.

Like @Colson003 said, and I dunno where you could even find a 11 tooth pulley meant for esk8

I wouldn't go smaller than 15 tooths on a motor pulley without an idler. The smaller you go, the more Beltslipping you get.

Yet I was thinking about belt slippage but would use an idler as long as ppl haven't said anything like noooo that would end the world not to bothered about belt wear. I have used 15-16 tooth in the past but need more room
