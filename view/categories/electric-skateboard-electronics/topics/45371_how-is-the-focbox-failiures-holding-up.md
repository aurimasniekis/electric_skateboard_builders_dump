Hi I'm waiting for my focboxes to arrive, in the meantime I have noticed alot of focbox failiures in FOC mainly in the new vesc-tool which seems to have a bug which the Ackmaniac-tool solved. But how is it now? 
Is the new firmware for vesc-tool stable or should I downgrade to bldc tool which I am used to and the community also know well.

Plan is Dual focbox in FOC with limit erpm and split ppm. Pre loaded with Ackmaniac 3.1

Feel free to discuss anything related to this and sidetrackes aswell.

You cannot Set a erpm limit in FOC Mode at all or there is no critical erpm number which could burn the drv?

Is the bug on the vesc tool firmware fixed? Iâ€™ve been using it for a couple miles with no problems. Also I set my erpm limit in the motor tab to around 37,000 with 20% limit start. This limits my speed to around 20 mph.
