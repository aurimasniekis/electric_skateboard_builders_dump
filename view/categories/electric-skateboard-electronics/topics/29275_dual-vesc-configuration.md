Hi Everyone,

So I'm building a board with dual 190kv motors and a 12s4p battery with BMS. 

I'm very confused on how to configure the settings for the vescs, because I've heard that a lot of settings need to be halved like motor regen. If someone could give me a list of what I need to change that would be absolutely amazing.(I'm good on the can bus and slave/master settings, but not actual numeral settings) 

Also, I've heard that if you aren't careful you can permanently damage the vescs and battery. What exactly will prompt that to happen in the vesc settings? 

Thank you so much for your help! I'm very new to all this and given that I spent a lot of money on these parts I don't want to mess anything up.

There's a bunch of threads on how to configure your VESC so I suggest you take a look at those and then post the settings you find here. We're glad to review to make sure they're all okay, but you must first do your due diligence and research. Here's a good place to start.
