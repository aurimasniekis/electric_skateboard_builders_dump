I got one from [here](https://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/mountable-charging-adapter) because I wanted 5.5/2.1mm DC socket, but if you don't mind soldering [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Lsgoodcare-Threaded-Connector-Adapter-Dustproof/dp/B06XRT5C2Q/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_23_tr_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=2ZW8T2G5RMF7N6A2ZYXM&dpID=51p3xXp7rOL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=detail) has them too.

If you want to monitor stats you only need one, if you want to change settings in both VESC you will need two

Can we get a wiring diagram for this plug, please ? Just need to it to charge my new board and the charging port I used on my previous had only 2 pins (easy to understand and wire but there is 3 pins on those new ones, 2 positive and 1 ground)

Thank you, @Kuchi ! I saw this picture when searching for information on wiring but it's still not clear for me.

I think the left side of the picture is enough but what is the right part for ? I won't rewired each time I unplugged so it makes me confused... Guess it means that when no plug is inserted, the 2 positive pins (linked by green lines) are connected/shorted but I'm not sure.Can you confirm or explain if I'm wrong.
Thank in advance.

I would just go by what it shows in the first, don't know what the second is showing

Make sure you don't mix up that some are 5.5mm x 2.5mm and some are 5.5mm x 2.1mm.

For eskate you almost certainly want to AVOID 5.5mm x 2.5mm

Pay attention to that ;-)

This is late af, but does it matter which positive pin I use? I soldered the connection to the third pin instead of the second pin like the diagram, but since both are positive I don't think that matters?

Sorry for the newb question... but why should we avoid 5.5mm x 2.5mm?

Because mixing and matching can cause loose connections and arcs which causes heat which can melt stuff or in the absolute worst case, a fire.

If you stick to everything 5.5mm x 2.1mm you won't have any issues and if for example you buy a charger from someone on the forum, then it will fit because *everyone* uses 5.5x2.1 in esk8

Does anyone know max amp rating on these? I guess 5.5-6A, for 4-5A rated connector still should be fine, right?

I saw somewhere few folks said 8A wouldnt be so good and could start causing some damage / trouble already..

Any thoughts on this topic?

These seem to be sturdy (good metal pins) though they are 5.5x2.5mm.. but charger hasnt been ordered and it has option for 2.5mm plug anyways

2.5mm charger will be hard to find.

Just get the 2.1mm. I use this exact one at 3.5a charging with no problems. Not sure about 6a but I suspect should be ok.

Thanks for the answer.  I didn't know 5.5mm x 2.1mm was standard.

Unfortunately I bought 5.5mm x 2.5mm connectors and chargers.  I'm assuming it's safe to use 5.5mm x 2.5mm as long as the charging port and charging connector are matching specs?

Yep, just don't trade parts or try to use any commerical board chargers or anything except use those 2 you have together, and cut the connector off if you sell it
