Hey guys

I have the following battery indicator: 
https://www.banggood.com/GY-6H-12V-24V-36V-48V-Lead-Acid-Battery-2-15S-Lithium-Battery-Capacity-Indicator-Digital-Voltmeter-p-1234168.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN

And I need to display correctly stats for 10s3p battery.
It has two buttons on the back but no instructions.

Anyone has experience with this? Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Dani

I believe you have to hold down one of the buttons (I think the one that says Set Key) while it's turned off and then while still holding the button down, connect the LCD to power and it'll display the config options
