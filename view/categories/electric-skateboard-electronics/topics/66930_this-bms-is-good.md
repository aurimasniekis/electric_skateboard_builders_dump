It's safe to use, I've used this exact one (60 A version).

Just have the charge cables run in parallel to the BMS output and have the antispark be located further down the line than the charge cables so they're always connected.

Battery Supports also known as Supower are said to be good however they do have a fairly low balance current of only 60ma.
What bms did you have before when your brakes failed?

Is there a us supplier if this BMS? The wait for shipping from China is too long.
