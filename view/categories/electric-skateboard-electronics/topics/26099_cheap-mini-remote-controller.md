Hey guys I found the mini rc remote [here](https://www.banggood.com/2_4GHz-Radio-Remote-Controller-Receiver-Transmitter-For-Electric-Skateboard-p-1125575.html?rmmds=cart_middle_products) for 18 bucks right now with a coupon.

Just got an extra one as a backup

edit: Just as an FYI

1. Bangood takes paypal
2. you need to put both the remote and the receiver in your cart. Its 18 for both with the coupon.
