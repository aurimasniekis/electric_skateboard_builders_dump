I got two bad FVT esc's last year. Some of them are just faulty infortunatly... You probably need to get a new one. 
I dont think that your motor is fried. If you have not even been riding on it, I dont believe that it can be fried. It is probably the ESC. 

Other than that your build seems to be very close to be finished. Your motor seems a little bit small but I am sure it will be fine. You just have to give it a little push when you begin to accelerate.

Keep us posted!
