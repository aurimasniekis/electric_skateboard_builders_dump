Hey guys.  I just upgraded my 600 mile board to some new motors that I purchased from someone that was part of one of the @barajabali group buys for his silver motors that he gets from somewhere in China.

Before upgrading, I had 2x Torqueboards 6355 motors and they worked great.  Great acceleration and they lasted super long.  I upgraded to these expecting that there would be a large increase in torque and performance, however after upgrading to them today and riding them for a while, I honestly can say that I didn't really receive the performance increase that I was expecting.  In fact, they felt almost exactly the same, if not a little bit less powerful.  

I did notice that the brakes are stronger now, but really the acceleration feels worse.  Does anyone know if there is something that I did wrong or have experience directly comparing 6355 motors to 6374?  I thought for sure that the 6374 motors would have more kick.

![20190712_152311|375x500](upload://jMM46d9KeYgATN2cAEQVmjnZSca.jpeg)  

I'd really like to know if I somehow did something wrong here.  I left almost the same vesc settings.  I am running 12S FOC on two FOCBOX's.  The motors are pretty much the same as the 6355's, 190KV, sensored, etc.  I am running them at +-80 motor amps, although observing the logs from esc monitor, they never even hit more than 50 motor amps per motor.  I have the battery amps set pretty high as well.  If you are interested in seeing VESC settings, let me know and I will get some screenshots.

Its my understanding that 6355, 6365, 6374 are all the same strength but the bigger motors stay cooler while doing it. 

You might be expecting a difference in performance because of switching brands not size.

Lol that's funny cuz these actually got way hotter than the torqueboards ones.

I always thought that the 6374 motors were stronger.  What would be the point of upgrading, especially since my 6355 motors never got hot in the first place.

:roll_eyes: Probably not. Feels like I just wasted money tbh.  I thought about getting the TB 6380's but the price was holding me back.  I got these for 100 each.

Anyone else?

Honestly other than this my luck has been great with the hobby so far (5? builds)  This is the first time I got really disappointed by a purchase.

They do look amazing though and they sound a little different than the others.  I mean if you have some 6380's lying around that you wanna trade for :joy:

Lol i traded my 6880 maytechs to psychotiller for some 6369 maytechs and a few little bits to finish a build.
Honestly trying to run the smallest motors that meet my needs on builds for now on.
Lhb builds rockets with 6355.
A prefer a more narrow stance if possible.

Fair enough.  I know mine was super quick with the 6355's too but I thought I would get more from upgrading :wink:

Hmmm that is very unsatisfying.  Have you ridden 6355 vs 6374's before?

Would BLDC mode make any torque difference?

Should make a thread discussing motors sizes/ performance in that other place.  Bit more active. 

There's a older thread here talking about 6355 vs 6474. 
But a fresh discussion wouldn't be a bad thing.

Just remember sk3's may get hot but  are nearly indestructible.

Also if motors are the same kv, 6355 vs 6374 will make almost no difference

In my experience the TB ones were pretty much indestructible too haha

It took a my motor hiting a curb at 30 mph directly to fuck it up.

Hey dude,

I like for my components to last. I think that’s the most important quality. I haven’t ran any bench tests on these guys but I know they are the only motors I’ve ran and not have had any failures (I think most who have ran these can attest to that) 

They do get a bit warm but it’s nothing that concerns me, they level out and are never too hot to hold on to at all. 

Are you running sensors? 
I’d like to see the screenshots. You really should be getting a performance upgrade with these motors. Also, did you increase your settings after installing these new motors?

Even though these were a group buy and not a profit driven sale, I’ll still offer to buy them back from you. As long as they’re not beaten up. That’s how confident I am these motors. Just send me a dm bro.

For me... Going from dual 6355 to 74 wasnt a huge kick...however I feel like.my.board runs smoother with power and more consistentcy across the entire power band especially in the top end ...it keeps pulling pretty solid...

Alright alright I appreciate you standing behind the product and I totally agree that they are probably not going to be breaking any time soon.  I really like the look of them but it just came down to the question of if they are performing as they should or if the TB 6355's are just really extra good.

I'm not super worried about the heat either, I think that they probably will be fine, I was just commenting that it was interesting that they got hot while the 6355's barely got warm to the touch. 

As for the settings, I did not really change anything from the TB ones to these, because they appeared to be able to take the same specs.

Motor amps +-80, battery +60 -40.

I'm running sensored FOC on them.  I can get you some screenshots and data tomorrow night!  I did some runs with my 6355 at max throttle and I will do a few tomorrow with these to compare.  From initial impressions it did not seem like these even managed to pull the same amount of wattage from the VESCS.

Hey man I appreciate that.  I actually bought them from someone else if you noticed in the original post but I might take you up on the offer?  No knocks against you of course I just want to have the upgrade I was looking for :slight_smile:

I will try and work some firmware stuff first too if you are willing to work with me a little bit.

Is it possible that the startup boost could make a big difference?  I re-ran the motor setup wizard when I configured these new motors but I don't know if that resets startup boost or not.  I didn't think to check that until now

I used to run a sk3 6374 with single focbox with a 12s 90c lipo in bldc, after adjusting startup boost to 0.08 motor +70-60 and battery +40-20 it worked very well, before adjusting the startup boost it was a bit lame. Now I use a unity in foc and its very very good.

They were both maytechs... Although before I got the 74s I tried a pair of 50 dollar c6374s off eBay and def felt way less improvement from name.brand maytechs 55s vs the cheap 74s... They actually got hotter for my same riding style and were a hair smoother uphill... But the maytech 74s vs the knock offs were night and day...

Oh nice okay.  Yeah I hopped into the group buy in that other place for the MT 6374's for a friend's build so I am interested to see how those compare.  Granted his will be running on the TB VESC not FOCBOX so it will be slightly different.

MT is a good company, makes sense that they would be better than the knockoffs.

Hey man, you totally should work on the settings. I am sure you will see a nice performance increase. Start up boost helps but only in BLDC mode, not FOC.

If you really want to launch, bump the startup boost to .1, you'll be doing standing burnouts

I might actually switch back to BLDC mode simply to do that haha

So startup boost doesn't work in FOC?  Is there an alternative there or is it just non-existent?

I could bump my motor amps to 100 or something but I thought these could only take 80?  Furthermore, I have never seen them pull more than 50 per motor - if they don't pull more than that, where is the limitation?  Is it VESC?

Sorry, it should be 0.08 startup boost in bldc, my mistake (will edit) Another limitation could be your battery, what battery are you using?

Lol was wondering.  I have 4x 3S Lipo packs in series.  They are 25c 5000mah they should have plenty of kick.  This runs through a SuPower 60A continuous BMS

Have you checked how much sag you get at full throttle? I used a cheap 10s2p li-ion that sagged alot and my motor was getting warm. after using my 12s 90c lipo my sag is 1 volt and motors are running cool, I also heatsinked my esc.

One thing about sk3 motors is the initial take off is not as sharp as some other manufacturers creations.  On the same motor amp settings the torqueboards for example have a punch off the line but taper off.  Sk3's have a slower start but have a crazy mid range power band thing that I have not experienced with any other motor.  So to compensate I run them at a higher motor amp setting.  This does make them run hotter but not damaging hot.  The technicalities of that phenomenon escapes me but trust me set them up right and you will love them.  If not sell them to me.  Did I mention that before?  :sunglasses:

I have a 12s4p 30q pack running at 80 amps.   I have a 10s4p running at 100 amps.  Obviously the voltage is the factor.  I'm still trying to curve my settings into normalcy.  The 10s is better though across the curve.  The 12s still tries to buck me off when ever the need arises.  The bitch.
Shes my  fav though.

Point is you will not see a notable difference between 55 and 74 motors unless you change the settings.  With 74 motors you can get up in the realms of 100 amps with less chance of cooking the motor

just to get it right, the battery value you stated is the total current of both esc? so 30A master 30A slave?
if you use a unity than ignor this question.
