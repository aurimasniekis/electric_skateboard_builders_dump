You want him to make his own kydex (  thermoplastic acrylic-polyvinyl chloride ) :joy:

Oh I bought the mini one its not the nicest looking out there but it has a good reputation and much smaller than g2b or whatever

If I can find the files for the custom enclosure i might print one out at my school but dont know
I think it will do a really good job when I finish the board
