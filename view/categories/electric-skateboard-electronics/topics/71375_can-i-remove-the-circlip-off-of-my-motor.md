Hi. My motor can not spin because the circlip is blocking the way on the motor mount. What do I do?

the circlip holds the motor shaft onto the can. If you remove it, your motor will come apart

if you rempove the circle clip your can can become lose.
there are special spacer you could install instead, but it will not solve your problem.

place a washer or two between the motor mount and the motors. you want them on the screw that holds the motor on though.
