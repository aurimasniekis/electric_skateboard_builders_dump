Hello I was just wondering if is safe to mount the bms on top of my battery pack (18650) heat is a concern. Been looking for post on the subject so any links/advise would be a massive help.

Use a bit of crafts foam between the BMS and battery. doesn't have to bee too thick. Just a bit of protection for vibrations on the BMS.
