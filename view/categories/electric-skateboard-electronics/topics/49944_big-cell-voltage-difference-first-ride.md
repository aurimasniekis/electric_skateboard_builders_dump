Good news and bad news

Good:
I used my electric skateboard for the first time which was amazing! so fun

Bad news:
When it ran out of battery I checked the voltage of each cell and they were very different ranging from 3.08v - 3.2v. I did not charge my lipos before, I used them from the charge they were shipped at. did I make a huge mistake? did I fuck up my lipos? please help. I have ordered an Imax b6 but that won't be here for at least a week!

Charge them. Go for a test ride. Check for abnormalities. 
Rinse and repeat.

You must wait for the IMax If you dont have a balance charger yet. Do not Try to charge them without a balance charger!

Also, dont drain your lipos lower than 3.6v/cell. It will damage them in the long run

Sorry, was impulsive response, don't charge it and try again, don't do that.
You can balance your lipos manually with a light bulb, then after that, charge normally and  measure before ride and of course after. 
Good luck!

For sure, reading again your post, what I recommend, charge your batteries until the lowest cell goes to 3,6v and then manually discharge all the other cells to 3'6v, then they are balanced, start charging and control voltage in each cell

That's it, it works.
You can charge your batteries in the same way you did it before, just keep your eye on the balance connector checking voltages in each cell with the voltmeter while charging.
I know, my English sucks.

Yeah you can't program that esc. It was an auto-cutoff at about 3.0 volts per cell. Easiest way to make sure your lipos never discharge too low is to buy a $6 battery indicator on eBay, and just keep an eye on it while your ride. Never let it get before 30% (about 3.4 volts per cell) and you should be fine.

Concerning lipo charge level, then i think you are somewhat lucky. Ive heard the lowest someone should go is 3,2 v.

Though im sure u didnt mess up your battery, 3,08 v should still be somewhat okay.. just as recommended in future try to keep it on top of 3,3v or 3,5v per cell (ideally)

.. once u get your balance charger just follow the voltages and check that they are reasonable levels..

Worst case ive heard is that if lipos get buffed then they might be damaged and should be handled with caution.. though im sure yours didnt bulge up and ive seen people even using puffed lipos at great care and attention to discharge and cell level..

So yep.. be more careful and return cell voltages to normal level once possible

I would advise to install a proper voltage meter 'on board' of your deck.. That way it is always possible to somewhat see the total voltage and just stop at certain battery level or be just way more gentle once lipos are at lower charge..

Otherwise I would advise to get a proper 'lipo alarm' - though make sure not to make it unreachable.. once these little fuckers go off, they will constantly beep and annoy the heck out of you..

i would advise something like this - with decent voltage level readout and also alarm for specific levels.. plus I think the sound is somewhat changeable or you can at least make it go away more easier than with traditional lipo alarm u can get for 2$ or so on ebay.

Nice percentage / voltage readout - // does not show individual cell voltages unless u somehow hook one up to each group of cells.. (6+ total)

---

'Fancy meter' - shows also watts consumed / wh left in battery (will really show how much is left in your pack + helps to determine at what power level u are riding, while also showing other important data /// Takes up more space..

Personally I have been using this one:

https://www.banggood.com/G_T_Power-150A-High-Precision-Battery-Walt-Meter-And-Power-Analyzer-p-1005954.html?rmmds=search&admitad_uid=c2f7342b4a48c991180ac10264939672

Helps to see total wattage / power demanded from motor / esc. Helps to calculate how much is consumed from battery /// also isnt showing individual voltages, just the 'major''/ overall one of whole battery pack.

---

Last option (somewhat).. if u really one to cheap out.. and deal with annoying beeping once on of the cells reach certain level..

https://www.banggood.com/BX100-Battery-Voltage-Tester-Low-Voltage-Alarm-Buzzer-For-18S-Lipo-Battery-p-1070002.html?rmmds=search

---

Will throw in this one just for the 'kicks''.. was also somewhat consider getting this one, it has nice voltage readout on display.. (even though images dont show it on this site)

https://www.banggood.com/AEORC-CellDiag-6-C6-1-6S-Lipo-High-Accuracy-Alarm-Battery-Indicator-Tester-p-1218897.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN

---

Oh and yes..finally, consider getting one of these in the future:

https://www.banggood.com/ISDT-Q6-Lite-200W-8A-MINI-Pocket-Battery-Balance-Charger-for-2S-6S-Lipo-Battery-p-1212757.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN

I think you wont get similar high tech battery charger for similar price and comfort you can get with this one..

U should soon find out that stock b6 chargers take a while to charge up bigger batteries + they are not as 'intuitive' as this one should be.. will take a few clicks mostly, to start charging up your lipos.. at least thats how it usually is..

**I hope this helps..** not sure what else to add here @Orin635

Ok just set it to 3.3v per cell and u should be good to go once u charge up your battery next time.. _(check how it is done, i think u need to hold one button and wait for screen to start flashing.. )_

Just place it in a way you can still reach it.. and of course, u might need some sort of switch or parallel balance cable to keep it connected in a conveniant way.. otherwise u will need to plug it in and out all the time before use

Difference is quite big.. I had that little buzzer, it gets annoying over time + not really practical to see all voltages visually.. will take something like 10s to see whole pack voltage..

if u really want cheap, maybe get this one:

(when on sale, they are a bit cheaper.. or just find another source for them)

Will help with calculating left range also.. if u got any other Qs related to batteries, just ask

Some more options to look at:

(This one costs just 10 bucks.. but i personally dont like the display.. I think it had no backlight.. which might be minus..

Though I like that it has external led which starts to blink / shine once voltage is low..

I think wont find anything cheaper than that.. 

Might seem like a little investment but its worth it

Don't discharge your lipo any more.  They are fine till you balance charge them.  They are close enough in voltage the balance charger should average each cell just fine.  Just a heads up with the low voltage buzzer. If you are accelerating hard with a pack that is lower voltage 30-40% left it will sag and buzz every time even When your battery still has useable capacity left.

Charging wise about +3h charge time with 50w charger at max amps (when 30% left in battery). So even more when pack is more depleted. 

2A charge rate not much for 10ah pack.. though see for yourself, maybe u gonna charge in evenings only and it wont cause any problems

Range.. seems like 10miles for sure, maybe 12.. check calc
