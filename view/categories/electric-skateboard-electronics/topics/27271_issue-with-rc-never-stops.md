Hi guys, I bought this control...
https://m.es.aliexpress.com/s/item/32792845477.html?spm=a2g0n.orderList.0.0.BBtv74&#autostay
And connect to a Turnigy Esc that manage a Turnigy motor...but in the middle position (always return to that one) the engine keeps running and to stop it I need to swap down...this is how or should work? I will like to stop in the middle or go back by itself to the lowest position in case something just happend with the RC...any help please. Thanks

You need to calibrate the throttle.
Check the esc manual and how to program it.
