I'm thinking about putting a BMS on my board to make charging easier. Right now I've got 1 6S lipo, but I may upgrade to 8s or 10s later. Can I get a 10s BMS and still use it with my 6s battery?

I don't think you can. The balance port is for 10s so I don't think it will worl. Maybe you could wire it up somehow so that some of the ports are used and some aren't.

I would say no because that's it only says 10s in the specs.. Let me know how ur battery build goes! I'm in the process of mine!

In that case I'll probably just have to plan my battery upgrade more carefully.
