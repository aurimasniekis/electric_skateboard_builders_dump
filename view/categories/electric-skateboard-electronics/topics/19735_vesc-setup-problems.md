hey guys so I was setting up my vesc and everything is ok except when I use the my transmitter to accelerator my motor literally goes mental, like it just jumps like mad. Even if I hold it down it jumps out my hand. 

When I accelerate on through my keyboard it works fine. 

Does anybody know whats up with it?? 

Im using a may tech vesc and a Alien power systems 2.4Ghz transmitter.

you need to put some load on the board (like your body weight), or else it will just ramp to the max rapidly

Oh is that why its happening?? 

Because I'm just holding it then and there in my hand. If that's the case its a huge relief.

yeah it's probably the case. To get the real feel of your acceleration you need to be on the board. :wink:
