Hi,
has anyone given the dual maytech esc a go?
Was thinking about giving one a go but the amperage rating looks bit low?

I saw Mandys post on instagram and wondered the same. Seems a good way to being down costs to dual drive but in quads I've learnt it can be a false economy. if one goes then at least you have a single drive. With this it's pushing home.

No one tried one? I wonder if this is a controller from a established brand?

Ordered two, testing on a 10s4p board once i get them.Going to try to see how it handles 4wd with a y connector that they are providing. :) Would be the cheapest alternative ESC for 4wd board or single/dual. They stated the braking is still being tested, honestly that's my only concern so we shall see.

Interesting. 
It would be good to know if there is a program card for it, or some kind of computer interface?

Asked where my ESC is today and it seems they're not ready yet..

"The new esc is still making in our producing line.
As this is new design, we need make more time.
They will be ready in the end of this month
New products need test again and again, Do not worry about, I will inform you before shipping."

It is the maytec dual esc. 
Latest questions are....
"Please also check with the supplier the following informaiton:
4. Number of Pole(such as ?N?P):
5. diameter of the copper wire:
Or else, the dual esc will not work understand FOC.
Please check it"

Would anyone know the answers to these questions?
Here is a link to the motors.

Do you have the motor already? If yes open it and count. N stays for Stator Teeths with copper winding and P for permanent magnets of the stator, for example 12N14P.
Diameter of the copper wire is a bit difficult. Maybe you can measure it when the motor is open. Usually it is not just one phase wire, so you have to count the wire strands and measure the diameter of each strand. Not sure if they really need that exactly.

No, I'm not at home for a while and the motor has not arrived. 
Perhaps I'll ask the manufacturer.

Still having no luck with Racerstar. 
Maytech are now ready to send out the esc, but need.

1. Number of Pole(such as ?N?P):
2. diameter of the copper wire:
3.  Internal Resistance

I guess no-one has a racerstar motor?

I got an MTDU30A for $58 at alibaba.   I like it, had a couple of issues with  esc turning off when the enclosure puts some pressure over it.  Solved after rearranging it's position inside.
It has an On/off switch.

Tried it with 2 83mm hub motors from maytech. and a  10s3p torqueboards battery pack.

First ride had 2 failures.  don't know if it was a signal loss or over heat.  

Second ride,  no problems, but battery seems to dry really fast.   Made 5km with 35% of the battery. 34.5km/h top speed.

Third Ride: Tried it with just one Hub. 
The Hub got too hot, the rubber expanded and lost it´s anchor to the motor..  
25% of battery used, range 2,5km  34.8km/h top speed.

I weight 75kg, With one Hub was a little slow on start up, but I could use it if it wouldn´t get so hot.
ESC can´t be programmed.  There is a 


Let me know if you want me to try something with this esc!


This is all you get from Maytech:

Dual Drive speed controller, can work with 2 motors
Good FOC, excellent compatible to hall sensor motor
Cont. Current: 30Ax2
Burst Current:240Ax2
BEC: NONE
Lipo: 6-10S
PCB Size: 50x92x20mm
Great start-up torque with sensor motors

Hi, I try them,
Really, it's a cool cheap dual foc system :blush:
Whit dual hub 90mm and maytech receiver it a cool combo.
Im more VESC and geared system guy but ... this is pretty plug&play & having fun !

1st I test my hub with vesc and gt2b, parameter around 35amps motor max & 30amps batt max bldc (vesc 4.10).
Then, with the all maytech package I go  2 x 30 amps so the same in foc so. It is so compact !!!
It was summer when tested with vesc and they're so hot !!!.. When test with dualEsc is was cold weither so hard to say about that

I feels more silence oof curse, but also more powerfull (cause of my low vesc parameter setup - my bad).
I really like the remote with all his led comunication (mode, Tx battery and board battery), the eco and fast mode (really really cool !!!), the reverse work instentaly and perfectly swichable.
The dual esc got a powerswitch (but I add an xt90s between battery and them to be sure).

The build in receiver perfectly bind with my transmiter for eskating.eu

a short ride : 
https://youtu.be/PIBJ0zcG5s0

For a cruiser ride style, light and powerfull enought for short ride, really good reprise of torque when you ride in fast mode, I think it is a cool setup. Plus easy to mount with just the hub to set. You could go dropthrough and in 10s 80kv 90 mm you got more than 40/42kmh !
But around 12/15Wh/km I guess (I'm 80kg, very hilly terrain), I haven't test the range exactly ...

Hope it could highlight you a bit ;) (_sorry for my frenglish_)

I'm buying a single maytech 90 mm hub motor, and plan to upgrade to 2 motors eventually... 

does anyone have any recommendations for which esc i should buy... perhaps one that is cheap but good quality... but I'm also willing to hear their top models... and wondering about single vs dual esc??? maytech people recommended i buy their "super vesc"

what is the best way to flash the maytech super vesc... what are best settings based on their new 90mm hub motor?

Great work. Got the same esc and remote. However I want to bind a new record as maytech remote keeps sticking when I brake and go full throttle. Very dangerous. Do you know how I can bind/pair my old wowgo or meepo remotes as I love those. Simple and reliable. Thanks
