Hi all, 
This pm, the weather was wonderful so it was a really pleasure to ride into forest near my home.
But I've crashed as I lost the control when carving on grass/rock.
Thank to my guardian angel, no medical consequences as my exo-protections played the game (MIPS DH Bell helmet, Flatland3D gloves) but my remote was not covered by the same protections, and when it beat the floor locked between the floor and my gloves some big crashes are now visible, the attach (on remote side) of the wrist strap is broken...
How do you protect your remote? which soft cover/housing are you using?

I am looking for [rubber protection](https://flatland3d.com/shop/all-products/boosted-boards/remote-rubber-boosted/) for flipsky vx1 as flatland3d is doing for boosted board remote:
