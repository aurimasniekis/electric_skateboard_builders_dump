I've had to swap bms's 3 times (changed to smaller, charge only bms, then blew that cause I was dumb) and charge ports 2 times (I shorted one, then I wanted a right angle one) so I've had to solder and desolder parts of my circuitry multiple times and honestly, it gets annoying.

So I modularized everything.

I guess I just wanted to share how I did it for people who wanted to do something similar but had no idea how. 

Anyway here are the pics:

Also bonus tip, use wire organizing clips for more cleanliness.
