Lol I actually didn't even look at the price.  They have others for like $169 and around that price point... Still, I guess one should get a Escape for that amount.

But like 0 or 100% brakes most of the time.
I didn´t look to deep in this one how that behave, but most of the time you have to flash a different firmeware to kind of use it for our purpose
