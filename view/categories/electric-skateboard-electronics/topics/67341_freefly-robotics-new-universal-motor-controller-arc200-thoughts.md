From the looks of it (I can only spot 3 motor wires unless I'm mistaken), it's overpriced, at least for me.  Now, if this was a dual motor controller I definitely could consider it.

Come on whose going to drop the 600 plus shipping for science?  Come on anyone? 
Thats only marginally cheaper than the vesc6 and at least with that you know what you're getting.
Lovely website without any real info.  Wheres the data sheet? wheres the guts pics? If you're going to ask premium cash you should at the very least open the box.  Like the sneaky pics of the baja in there too.  Nice marketing because I'm pretty sure those controllers won't be on mine when it arrives. 
But.......but.....what if it is the premium product it looks like.....I won't be dropping that cash without a lot more info.
Edit; if they are on the baja then at least you lot will have a test monkey:laughing:

Hey Guys, I am from the Freefly team and we would be happy to send out a few sample units to users you trust to review the Arc200.  I realized we are new to the game and have to put our money where our mouth is.  

Who would you want to see review one?

Thanks!

Welcome. Ignore my previous dickbag comment, only meant in jest.

You'd need to send two out for dual drive to get some kind of real world use. Someone who would ride it like the other ten thousand bits of equipment he's used @okp ?

And someone who would stop just short of setting it on fire to stress test @longhairedboy ?

Damnit Jim, I'm an accountant not a computer programmer.  I can read tax codes, not this computer jibber jabber lol.

Ok, so sorry but a few basic things that not sure I missed.  Comparing your motor controller to some new ones coming out like the focbox unity and flipsky dual vesc will you have?

1.  Built-in anti-spark?
2.  Built-in bluetooth?
3. Android / Iphone app?
     A. Multiple custom profiles?

Question 3 is actually what peaks my interest in that the ARC200 is going for the "universal" motor controller approach.  I'd love to be able to swap out a controller to use on different vehicles / drones.  I can have an ebike, e drift trike, hydrofoil , and drone all using the same controller with just a 5 minute swap and change the profile simply on my phone.  Is this something you guys have in mind?

Hey! Space_Cowboy

1. Yes on Anti Spark (spark reduction)
2. Yes built in BT
3. Android / iPhone app coming if the market demand is sufficient for us to pursue!  We definitely have it in mind and you could certainly do this now with the PC GUI (But we know that only Tyler (brains behind Arc200) still uses a PC)

Thank you for answering the questions Tabb, I'll let the experts ask you the really tough ones.  

Honestly, at a price point of $300 dollars for a single controller is on the high end of things and I think for a majority of the users here, having to purchase 2 is a lot.  

However, if you can make that single controller easily swappable to different vehicles / drones using just a phone app, that definetley would be a game changer at least in my eyes.  At that point heck I may buy 2, keep one on a board at all times and swap the other one to different things.  Best of luck and looking forward to more info

```
Input Voltage: 4S (13.6v) - 12S (50.4v)*
Max peak phase current: 200A
Continuous current with little to no heatsinking (hot-side facing upwards and unobstructed): 60A
Continuous current when bolted to a typical EV aluminum chassis: 100-150A
Continuous current with infinite aluminum heatsink or water cooling, and forced air cooling on phase wires: 200A
Control Inputs: PWM, Analog (1x combined throttle/brake or independent throttle and brake), UART/CAN (for advanced users to interface through the Freefly API's QX protocol)
DC-Input: XT90
Phase-Output: 8mm Female Bullet
Sensor support: Fully sensorless, digital hall sensors, PWM, SPI encoder (AS5048)
Operating modes: Torque mode (EV), speed mode (Multirotor, requires advanced user tuning), angle/servo mode (experimental, requires advanced user tuning and high-resolution motor encoder)
23.4kHz switching frequency for zero audible PWM noise
Integrated 5A 5V BEC (Recommended continuous-current draw to be kept less than 3A)
Water resistant and splash proof - integrate into your application to avoid continuous water exposure

If not different style UI (.NET based) I would tell its VESC based on features, but looks like something different ;)

@tabbytabb, Fact is Esk8 right now is a very dangerous recreational sport. It’s made up of half ass skaters doing DH speeds wearing shit for safety gear. I’m beating this drum again when I say all electronic equipment is destined to fail. Overbuilding greatly reduces failure rates. The Esk8 community is quickly coming to understand this.  

Soon enough anyone will be able to competetivly race an electric skateboard out of the trunk of their car for a couple of grand. Be able to adjust, tweak, tune and set-up the same board for track, drag, road course, uphill and downhill racing with a relatively reliable power delivery system. We're knocking on that door. for the 75mph World Record run function wise we’re 90% dialed in for the record attempt. Max Capps has been giving great feed back in testing and only minor changes have been made from the original setup. https://youtu.be/Hsj9guNrlmU 
 We’re on target for October.  I wouldn’t put  rider on anything untested at any speed. I have access to a wheel Dyno as a test rig. As you know prototypes rarely are perfect at first rendering and usually require changes. Max and I are already in discussion on 100mph (161kph) attempt for 2019. Will require 20k watts some aero, and ground effects. A bigger project for sure, but I have the guy who can get the job done if he stays healthy racing DH between now and then. Also been in talks with a rep from Maytec on a 300a cc 16s rig. It’s a great opportunity to work with people willing to put some skin in the game. I believe that people who push limits always make better for the common user in the end. 

Mountain climbers have a safety factor of 5 built into their equipment. It means 20% of breaking strength for rope & hardware is the working load limit. When were talking about a human being propelled at 47+kph a safety factor in the form and function needs to be in place as well. Much of the industry DIY and production pushes load limits to close too the edge. Would be my pleasure to work with you on this project. 

Another iron thats in the fire. Back in late March I got the ok through Kevin Reimer to test the viability of Esk8 racing uphill at his DH event Tepes & Tacos. Raw run Up hill time was comparable to DH times. Closed road Uphill racing at DH events just makes sense. 200a 60v based esc would be a good fit.   https://youtu.be/R0Y0-aL2cmU

One problem with current Vesc based models is the e-rpm limits. 800kv 6pole motors I believe go beyond at 107k. We’re also talking 12k watt I will be hammering through this as well. 
We're using twin 12kw @60v motors in the WR board. Plenty of tax to put on your esc.

@MoeStooge is a damn good fit to test it to the limits with correct useage. @mmaner is respected and will give us a solid review. @longhairedboy will ride it a bit and then set it on fire in a ritual burning while naked in the woods with batteries strapped to his writhing body. After that he'll put it back into the board and ride it again.

They all seem like a great fit

Hi @tabbytabb, I would love to test one of the motor controllers. I have both a DIY Electric skateboard and a DIY E-Foil (which has various drive options like geared, direct and jet) that I can put the drive through its paces on. Here is a link to my E-foil build for a little more info on that: http://efoil.builders/t/jezzas-build-slow/976/56

@tabbytabb Great video, I was riveted.  The skateboard demo was great, very quiet and the acceleration plot is very interesting.  I'm a big fan of throttle curves.

I'm curious if you guys have plans for larger EV products?  I've got an old Jeep CJ7 that used to have an AMC 304 in it, that's dead now, but still has the 3 speed trans.  I've been thinking about converting it to electric, using a big ass curtis motor to drive the flywheel.  Does this sound like something your new 400a ESC could handle?

Favourite quote  "I'm like a big fan of vehicles that can kill you"  Well guys you are certainly on the right forum!
Can't wait to see some testing of the arc in our applications and the test crew you have assembled will certainly do that!
If @longhairedboy can't break it
If @mmaner can build it into a board during his coffee break
If @Kug3lis can take it apart and put it back together again
Then it will be shut up and take my money time!
Exciting stuff.

I have a single drive bustin pintail that I use to for n00bs.  It has a 10s3p pack and a 6374 motor.  It is sitting in the corner as we speak with the enclosure removed waiting on the Arc 200 :slight_smile:.

Quite simply, you won't use USB all the time. If you are running a non-sensored motor you wont need the sensor wires. So it would be nice to be able to remove the extra wires when not needed or have covers that prevent moisture or dust getting in.

On the output side, there are 3 phase wires and 4 other wires. PWM, USB, ENC (sensor) and THRO (CAN inputs) The diagram can be found here: https://freeflysystems.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRP/pages/269844541/Wiring+Arc200

Considering the effort to make the overall housing water resistant and splash-proof, it would be nice to either remove the extra wires not needed, or cover them with a cap that would make them water resistant as well. While my electronics sit inside an IP67 enclosure, I like to still cater for the possibility of water getting inside.

Thanks Alex,

They are a JST waterproof latching connector.  Its really hard to find waterproof and latching connectors in a size / weight range that we wanted.  I know David spent a long time looking for the 'perfect' connector.  

Its always such a tough tradeoff between designing things to be ultra bulletproof / cheap / lightweight.

@jayx is building a test rig for them now with some old li-ion 26650s of unknown chemistry, probably ICR, maybe INR, who knows. It's gonna be a real rat rod scrappy scrapper. 

Follow his build on https://www.instagram.com/theonlykindajake/

Based on what i've seen, it's nothing like vesc tool and its kind of weird. The entire package is nothing we're used to. Also, no 13S. 12S MAX. 

The plan is to drag race them if they work out because they're allegedly so awesome and can take so much powah. We'll see about that shit, son. 

Then i'll take it to Colorado and get @Lunasi and @MoeStooge to race on it because i want to see that.

So far we've just been putting every release out as a new patch release number. Don't take this to mean the changes are trivial. I'm not sure it's going to fix all your problems, but it's a good place to start at least.

If the different speed you're talking about is what's in that video in your other post where the motors aren't always in speed-sync, don't worry about that unless you actually feel it when riding. Since the Arc drive is a true torque-mode controller as you have it configured, it takes almost no current to spin up the motor with no mechanical load on the wheel. This means tiny little tolerance offsets in the current sensors, throttle PWM/analog sensors, etc. add up to tiny differences in current commands. With such little mechanical load, you see this when there's no load on the motor. For example if one ESC is seeing a 1A command, it might spin up while if the other ESC has a 0.5% tolerance difference on command, out of 200A full range it might be reading 0A command at the same time. The 1A motor will spool up while the 0A motor is still sitting still. Once you ride it, you no longer notice this because current commands are much higher.

The braking issues are my biggest concern that we need to get fixed as the top priority, then see where you're at on ride quality.

@christensent Normally I don't run FOC, if I do its only hybrid mode.  I don't mind the sound and with the VESC I don't see any benefit to FOC at higher RPM's and there is a significant hardware stress issue.

I'm just waiting on an enclosure to get mine up and running.  My tentative setup is sensorless.  Should I order a 2nd fly lead for sensored operation and can cable or is this good enough?

@mmaner Arc is always FOC in all operating modes and states, so there's no need to select or worry about what mode it's in.

In our internal testing, most people have been quite happy with sensorless performance. It's not perfect and if you want full starting torque from a stop up a steep hill, you're going to need sensors. If you get the board up to even a crawl speed it will pick up sensorless no problem, and on flat ground jitter-start will usually start a vehicle from a stop (when optimized for your vehicle... it takes some trial and error to get the right jitter settings, with the default jitter start settings it often won't really start a vehicle sensorless without giving it a kick to start moving).

@christensent 
We got it running last night using a dual PWM set up. I'll forward @jayx the link to the CAN setup information. He's the one building out the test rig and learning the config at the moment, i've got my hands full with evolve mods, battery builds, and another witchblade custom i'm building out. And i was recently loaned a Ninebot Z10 to learn and have been falling off of it repeatedly, which is very important work. 

My initial reaction to the ARC200 dual set up we're running is that its super smooth, a "wall of power" is how jake describes it. I rode around on them a while and i really like the feel of them. At the moment we're running non-sensored motors trying to test the accommodations it has for them and see how it behaves: start from standstill, start from standstill in less than ideal conditions such as with the drive wheels in a gutter or on an incline, roll back then roll forward transitions, etc. 

It's very, very quiet. Even the stuttering on start (which still happens for us at the moment, still toying with the config) is quiet and sounds weirdly muffled. We are getting a lot of (very muffled and quiet) stuttering on start, and it doesn't want to come out of the gutter from a standstill like my board does. But the overall riding experience (while riding and not starting up) on them is extremely polished and lovely. 

Any advice  for settings on making the start from standstill smoother would be appreciated. I'm sure there's something we're just missing. I'll get the exact specs on the motors we're using in a few, but i think he's got a set of brother hobby 6380s on there, not 100% sure of the KV but i suspect 190.

Correction, its a set of G-Force 200KV 6374s. We aquired them through an eval, we seem to get a lot of things to test these days. 

I also have a brand new set of SK3 6374 190KV motors we can try, and of course i have sensored 6355s from maytech, but i'd really like to see what these can do uncensored first. Even a Hobby King FOC ready vesc based ESC can deliver pure joy on sensors. If the ARC200 is really going to set itself apart, it needs to perfect sensor-less operation and fool people into thinking its magic like the site says it does, so we'll keep playing with the settings.  

I can feel some magic in there though.

By far the most important thing to play with for smooth sensorless startup is the Jitter Speed 1 and 2 parameters. This really takes some trial and error to get right for a particular vehicle. Usually with five minutes work on these you can get startup working far better than defaults. You will probably end up somewhere in the 15 to 150 range on these numbers.

These numbers are going to be some of the most valuable to share so that we can sort of crowd-source the tuning of jitter startup! The more data points I can get, the closer we can come to a more universal method of tuning the sensorless startup that requires less trial and error.

just reflashed the firmware, that seems to have cured it for now, but we have to start all over on settings. 

it’s possible a phase lead short corrupted the firmware, we may have found a possible cause there. 

also we’re finding these control modes often don’t make sense for esk8. For example, there doesn’t seem to be an exact equivalent for “forward no reverse with brake” as torque forward or whatever it’s called provides no braking when rolling backwards.

also the UI. It’s way to advanced. All of this needs to be hidden behind an Advanced Mode and the default needs to be something dead simple that allows you to: run detection -> adjust battery settings like max current and voltage cut offs based on cell count and Ah ratings -> play with motor amps ->  tune remote -> save. 

We’re not noobs and this interface has us throwing wrenches. But if you’re targeting high end DIY, it’s critical to have an easy way to get it working and then offer everything else once the builder is ready.

That's an interesting exception, I'll have to look into that. Not sure why that's happening! Does that come up right when you move the RPM set point slider? Looks like the number is correlated to that set point.

What is your max motor amps? If you have it set to 200, try a bit lower. Many motors have some stability issues at 200A and around 175A works much better. Also check out the FAQ "When I have a high max torque command (usually you run into this at 150A or greater commands) sometimes it just pops when given high throttle instead of giving torque" for more methods of fixing this: https://freeflysystems.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRP/pages/278822913/Motor+Drive+FAQ+s+and+Common+Problems

In the future, save your config before updating firmware then you can just re-load the .UMDS2 config file so you don't have to re-do setup.

In torque forward only, you should be able to brake, but you'd do it with the throttle not the brake. When rolling backwards, throttle still makes you accelerate forward which is now coming to a stop.

Thanks for the GUI feedback. This is our internal engineering GUI that sort of morphed into a public product. We certainly hope to greatly simplify things in the future.

In the future, save your config before updating firmware then you can just re-load the .UMDS2 config file so you don’t have to re-do setup.

yeah, we found that pretty early on. Crisis management and all that lol. 

[quote="christensent, post:122, topic:67341"]
In torque forward only, you should be able to brake, but you’d do it with the throttle not the brake. When rolling backwards, throttle still makes you accelerate forward which is now coming to a stop.
[/quote]
That is not really acceptable behavior for an ESC in this particular community. There needs to be a brake in which you pull back on the throttle to stop, and push forward to go. Directionally re-orienting is not so safe for a person, though i'm sure for a camera its fine and probably even desirable. Perhaps a new or different mode is in order.

That makes total sense. Obviously this is an earlier release, and i'm very glad to hear that you're working on a way to dumb it down for us a little.

Ok... to clarify, are you still having fault issues where it cuts out on accel and/or brake, or is that what seemed to be fixed by a firmware update? You should be good on just about any motor you'd typically pair to this drive up to around 150A accel or regen current but if you still end up with faults you'll want to try the things in the FAQ entry I referenced.

at the moment no, we're not having any issues, we managed to get around whatever that error was during detection by reloading the firmware and saved settings. 

The only complaints we have at the moment are with the UI, and with the lack of a "forward no reverse with brake" mode that works the way the rest of the ESCs in our community do. 

Other than that, at the moment, we're pretty happy with them.

![image|375x500](upload://5EiRed5pgmTwcXbyj7anActxATJ.jpeg) I was out riding on the trail and got about twenty miles out before I stopped to do a volt check, when I tried going again, one of the motor controllers flat out stopped working. It stuttered and locked up, I tried to unplug it’s power lead to run single drive and it locked the other one up. I ended up having to plug it back in and unplug the phase leads going to the locked up controller to get the other one to spin up again and limp me home.

If you have a motor connected to the bad ESC, is that motor locked or cogging unexpectedly even if there is no power attached to the drive?

Also can you describe the wiring configuration for control? Is this PWM control? If so, are you using one primary and one secondary cable?

No, there is not any cogging when you disconnect power from the esc. It only locks up when I power on the esc. 
I am running split PPM using the wires included with the esc’s. One primary and one secondary connected to the esc’s.

I think the easiest resolution is going to be to send you a new drive and have you send that one back. I'll take a look at the drive and see if I can figure out the failure mode so hopefully we can avoid whatever went wrong in the future!

Our KV is in very different units than a typical motor rating (Arc uses V/RPM while most brushless motor convention is RPM/V - additionally FOC and BLDC have somewhat different KV values).

Not sure if I already told you this as I've somewhat lost track of who has been having what issues, but make sure you update your firmware to the latest. What's been shipping out on the drives is quite old at this point and there were a lot of improvements that might help things like regen braking stutter. Don't forget to save your settings to a file before updating firmware as it'll usually wipe the configuration! That said some of the defaults on certain filters changed since early firmware so to get the latest and greatest settings it's good to just re-run the configuration process if you don't mind spending the time since an old config will revert to the old filter values.

To _approximately_ convert between the two, take your typical KV number such as 192, and calculate 1/(2 * that_number). That results in 0.00260 in the Vp/RPM units of Arc200 for the SK3 which is pretty close to your value. This calculation is only approximate since motor manufacturers usually give the BLDC value so you really want to use Arc200's autotune value to get the sinusoidal KV, but this lets you approximate if you need to and at least do a sanity check on the autotune value.

I've been able to ride 1 time in a week because of rain. I wish I could do it today, but rain. It's supposed to clear off Tuesday, so maybe I can do a test run then. 

From my limited ride time I can say this. 

1.  It works, well.
2.  Torque delivery is massive, more than any other controller I've used. 
4.  Temps remain stable at high amp draws, even with no external sync. 
5.  It's a monster to program, definitely need a better config interface. 
6.  Assuming longevity (that the Arc 200 lasts a long time) it's a deal as it's cheaper than other ultra high amp ESCs.

I thnkwe may have some wiring transposed somewhere, the errors we're getting say that the sensors are in a non-standard orientation, but @Blasto says the raptor hubs are a standard 60deg orientation, so there's still some sorting out to do. 

meanwhile.. sensorless operation is very impressive. these raptor hubs are nasty at 12S on these ESCs.

If you're not already, try the latest 1.1.7 firmware I posted last month on the wiki (https://freeflysystems.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRP/pages/269320215/Arc200+Firmware+Updates). I improved the hall-sensor autotune robustness. There was an issue previously where you'd get that non-standard orientation message if the motor wasn't spinning at just the right speed (which was usually in the 500-1000rpm range). It should work well at most speeds now and give a correct error message informing you if it's an invalid calibration speed. Try 1000rpm with the new firmware.

Will there be an update in the future that includes a more standard method of motor detection that this community is more used to? At the moment, we're doing detection by flipping another board over on its back and spinning up the wheels like a dyno, then setting the Freefly equipped board's wheels on it.

On VESC based systems, which most of us are using, sensor and motor attribute detection is done by having the esc spin up the motors using some basic algorithm then getting the feedback it needs from that. I'm not going to pretend i understand exactly how it works, because detecting motors by running the motors seems like carts and horses in the wrong order but they do it that way and it works well.

You should not spin up your motors externally. Something is very wrong if that is required, and it won't result in good measurements. Arc200 also spins up the motor itself for detection (granted through a considerably different technique than VESC, but a similar user experience).

I recall seeing a video a while ago of someone doing this, not sure if that was you. You need to keep turning up the slider in the FOC tune pop-up until the motor starts spinning. Specifically, you'll have to command a speed higher than RPM Closed Loop 1 which is automatically calculated in a prior autotune step. Once you command a speed this high, the motor should ramp-start and spin on its own **then** you click the start on the FOC autotune. This may be a bit confusing because the start button does not spin up the motor, rather you spin up the motor yourself with the slide then click start afterwards (at some point I'll clarify this in the GUI workflow).

It's definitely reliable and performs very well. It's one of those weird situations where you have way more capacity than you need, but that just makes the load percentage that much less. I think it would be difficult to kill one of these.

@boubak The hardware has not changed since we began shipping, everyone has the same hardware and is the same thing you'd get if you ordered today. Testing was completed before we started shipping.

@mmaner The only way to get telemetry is through the telemetry tab of the Windows GUI. You can connect to the GUI over either USB or BTLE. There is also logging where you can download data logs from previous drive runs over USB, but at the moment that is disabled in the latest firmware due to a software bug that we are working on (hoping to get logging re-enabled in the next firmware release).

I am going to do a build log on this board pretty soon, just want to get some substantial ride time in before I do.  I rode for about 6 miles this weekend, just downtown and in the neighborhood behind my house.  There's no long stretches to let loose on, but I hit 27 mph pretty easy in a quarter mile flat straight.  The torque is sick, even sensorless I don't have any trouble starting from stand still.  I am using a very liberal acceleration curve as this thing will throw you quick.  There's just so much raw power available.

The only 2 things I would suggest need improvements are the Programming UI and connectors.  Ill outline the issues I ran into with both.

**Programming UI / Software**

It's very complicated.  Coming from VESC configs it's not very intuitive, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but on it's on it prohibitivly complicated.  I found myself referring back to the youtube tutorial 3 and 4 times before taking the next step, just to make sure I understood what was going on.

My biggest issue was related to resolution.  I tried 3 different notebooks and on none of them could I see all of the config windows.  As there is no scroll bar on the sub-windows I had to switch back and forth between landscape and portrait to be able to click buttons, it was pretty cumbersome.

I like that these controllers are so configurable, but maybe a frontend where you can enter basic values and then punch a couple of buttons to configure might have some utility.  

**Connectors**

The connectors are robust and will likely never break during normal use.  That being said, the 8mm bullets are fairly difficult to work around because of the size.  Is that large of a bullet connector necessary?  The sensor cable should probably be a more common form factor, that would save some space and be easier to connect to motors since its going to be a solder connection anyways.

I broke the USB cable on one of the Arc 200's because I was swapping back and forth so much, checking values and testing changes.  Either a USB type 3 or JST type connector would be more reliable I think.

The size of the connectors and the amount of lead length on each connector requires a lot of space and they need to be secured when the install is complete.  I'm not sure how to resolve that other than maybe a single dongle that all the connectors are on and/or maybe shorten the leads substantially.  

The space requirements for the Arc 200 are substantially higher than that of a FocBox or VESC 4.12, so much so that to fit a 12s4p I had to build my pack as a double stack and get a custom depth Alter Wedge enclosure from @psychotiller so that everything fit.

Any new testing for these @longhairedboy @mmaner @Kug3lis ? Would these be good on a off road build you guys think?

Anything you want to throw a ton of amps at the Arc 200 is good for.  I rally cant say anything bad about them, they have been rock solid and so much muscle.

I'd just like to report back that @Jayx finally burned up an ARC200 and we sent it back to them for diagnostics. There was a short somewhere in it. The ESC died while riding, and while trying to reset it by unplugging and plugging it back in the XT90 asploded. 

the other ARC200 is still fine. We're probably going to make a single drive out of it to further beat it senseless. 

So far these units have been both difficult to set up and absolutely dreamy to ride. And they took a LOT of abuse prior to the one failing. It had anywhere from 20 to 60 miles put on it per day and we've had them a good minute now.

I agree they are beastly little things! I have even run mine on my milling machine to mill aluminium and it has handled superbly!
