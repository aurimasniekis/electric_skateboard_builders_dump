# Maytech mini remote range problem

Iâ€™m having a similar problem to the one [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/maytech-remote-problems/38455) My maytech remote works reasonably well when my left hand (Iâ€™m goofy) is close to the battery box. As soon as I move the remote to my other hand, I start getting cutouts. 

I accidentally broke the wire antenna but spliced it together. I might not have done this properly - I simply folded the wires over each other and insulated it with tape. Probably not the best technique. 

Iâ€™ve tried all the suggestions in this post but the range is still very limited. 

Actually the one last thing I havenâ€™t checked is whether the receiver board is facing away from the components. 

I thought the range on these was supposed to be >20m! (According to their [site](http://www.maytech.cn/en/maytech-mtskr1712-e-skateboarding-mini-wireless-remote/11032.html))

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I've heard keeping your receiver away from your battery leads and phase leads effects range somehow? maybe check that out

Yeah that was one of he suggestions in the other thread I linked to and Iâ€™ve tried that out. It makes a little bit of a difference but the range of the remote is still less than 2 metres.

If I remember right @rich had similar problem on his urban carve board with the maytech remote.
Not sure if he found a solution, but if did, he will tell you how to fix it ðŸ˜‰

I found the solution but sorry for the disappointing answer, the only solution was to NOT use it anymore :face_with_raised_eyebrow: 

But I think I had different problems with this Maytech MTSKR1712 remote compared to @Songsta. I got a lot of cut offs near to traffic lights, lights in general, gas stations, WLAN, and so on. I had to bail several times when going downhill because of not having brakes for several seconds. I found out that when I bend my knees hard and almost touch the board with the remote I don't have cut offs but who wants to ride like a monkey.

On both my boards I use the Steez remote (Maytech MTSKR1512) which is expensive and not perfect but has a VERY reliable connection, I can't ride a board with confidence without having a reliable remote connection.

I also bought the winning mini remote but haven't tested it yet so I can't talk about the range or connection. I recognized it has a quite poor throttle range.

Do you have an antenna wire on the receiver? I don't.
Or do you mean one of the yellow, red or brown wires which are connected to the vesc?

I think your battery box is made of carbon, maybe the upper lid, too. This could cause your problems. Maybe try to position the receiver outside of the box or at least without upper lid for testing if it makes any difference in range. 

Many people using this remote without problems but also many have interference problems depending on the area where they live.

This is the only time I have ever experienced a problem with my many maytech 1712.  Only on my carbon deck did I have an issue with poor range and had to position the receiver in a special plastic cap that covers a hole in the deck. It worked perfectly after that and as indeed it does in all my other boards. The only time I get connection issues are when its low on power.

By the way thankyou for the kind words the other day on that cheap enclosure thread.  Meant a lot my friend.  
This maytech remote is the best one I have used to date but it lasts so bloody long I forget to charge it.  It spat me off the other day at full acceleration while leaning forward like a maniac.  Felt like the brakes had come on and off I flew.  It will power back up for another 5 mins or so though so if you're close to home all good. If not its uber time.

Interesting to hear. So you experienced just a poor range because of carbon or also random drop outs?

I like the remote and the 2 modes but in my city area it's dangerous.

Haha I guess all remotes have this problem. The steez goes full throttle sometimes (when applying a bit throttle) with low battery and the battery lasts only for 2 rides, need to change the battery for a bigger one. I charge the remote after each ride.

In the rural area where I live the Maytech was pretty solid. In the city I experienced repeated dropouts at the same spots on a route Iâ€™d regularly ride. RF interference with this Maytech remote is a known issue and is noted throughout the thread linked below.  I was told to wrap the receiver in aluminum foil to shield it from RF interference. It didnâ€™t resolve the issue. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/does-anyone-else-s-remote-have-spotty-connection-when-riding-by-traffic-lights-intersections/59131/47

I eventually switched to a different brand of remote because the constant dropouts were unsettling.

No random drops.  Never had that at all.  I'm thinking maybe the tech over here in Aus might be a bit less advanced for the signals etc.  No problems at all.  The range was just bad through the carbon deck.  It would cut out if I raised my hand above my shoulder or outstretched my arm.  Once I re positioned the receiver all good again.  I have found though in general with all the remotes I have used the best place for the receiver is dead central in the deck layout.  I ride right handed and so the receivers are always positioned dead centre on the right hand side of the enclosure.  Severely secured.  I also shrink wrap the receiver on those maytechs too.

aw youre welcome :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

Ive never had it apply full throttle randomly, although I have had it lightly tap the breaks at low speeds

I used a plastic drybox as my enclosure though, maybe my material was 'better'?

I forgot to mention that I live in vienna (austria), a city with 2 million citizens, many signals for interference here.

But according to your description of the poor range I guess this is exactly the problem of @Songsta which can be solved.

This is interesting because that problem I had the other day may have been that.  Thats a worry to me because this latest creation is stupid fast and I would hate to have the brakes apply when really travelling.  I was going about 15mph at full throttle from a standstill uphill and accelerating when it felt like a brake applied. I put it down to cut connection but if as you say yours taps the brakes maybe it was something else.

I'm not in an inner city environment by any stretch of the imagination.  Sleepy little beach town with not many people.  It does baffle me though how the rc industry can produce controllers that work perfectly but we can't seem to.  Then again you probably don't notice a quick connection loss when driving an rc car or drone.  You notice it on an esk8 though
Notice it a lot.

Yes. I think this was something that was added by Trampa though, as I also saw it isn't on the standard issue.

I'll do this. There is a hole cutout for the LCD display which I can perhaps mod a little too get the receiver through. At the moment I just worked the receiver antenna wire outside the box, but seeing that the 'antenna' wire isn't official, I'm not convinced that's actually doing anything.

OK, I made the modification and moved the receiver to just above the LCD on the enclosure. It works! The range is much better!

But like an idiot I went for a test skate without securing the receiver and now I've broken some of the wires. :man_facepalming: . Guess it's time for the soldering iron.

I managed to pull the wires on my receiver again! 

I went to all the trouble of successfully soldering the wires back on the receiver and building an enclosure for the receiver that I then glued to the top on the main enclosure. I went for a test ride and on the way back the little enclosure broke free and one of the wires got ripped off again.

So I came back to solder it and really struggled. My technique is really bad and I think I may have heated up the pc board too much and now it's not working. 

So I'm going to have to find a new receiver for the remote. Does anyone know where I can get one?

Or perhaps it's salvageable?

Here you go. This is after I removed the wires again and tried to clean it up.

I fixed it! I connected the ground cable and then touched the 5V cable to pin, but nothing happened, so I touched it to the next one and the light went on. I realised that at least then the receiver wasn't broken. I then connected the yellow wire in the correct hole and tested where on the board the 5V wire would turn on the board and sync with the remote. I found the spot and then soldered the wire directly to that spot. This is the spot that it turn out to be:

![20190113_121044|690x397](upload://x6aT3TXX4OO4ZFM6pYIuksvqK6M.jpeg) 

I then made a very basic enclosure for the receiver to stick on to my enclosure with doulbesided tape.

![20190113_142210|375x500](upload://voZABIO2Gz4LXdH3ekmBSbohlix.jpeg) 

This whole bit is in there. 

![image|500x500](upload://sXrGPPdVyMvyc9mGgiYCwlZc3ZW.jpeg) 

It stays completely stuck to the board and now there is absolutely no movement between the wires and the board, so no chance of them coming lose!

I'm really glad I don't have to get another receiver! 

The enclosure is quite flimsy, so I'll upgrade it when I have a moment, but for now at least I can skate.

I think building a much better trigger based remote with an information screen is a huge opportunity for some company. The remotes are a big gap right now.

Iâ€™m gonna go ahead and say this is false. Iâ€™ve driven esc cars for many years and you definitely notice if there is a cut out. Especially during full on racing.

Same here and I can honestly say that I have never experienced it during a race.  My futaba was over $400 aus though lol
Then my original point still stands then.  Why on earth can't we make a decent remote for esk8?  People baulk at the cost of a hoyt but seriously its the most important part of the set up imo.  If you can't trust the remote you can't relax and enjoy the ride.  I personally would pay a premium for that peace of mind.

Skateboards should work like drones. They need to watch the wheel speed and sense the current incline. The remote needs to control into actual speed, not motor speed. The incline and current speed could predict the exact motor speed needed to achieve this. Then you control where the board is over time, not what the motor is doing.
