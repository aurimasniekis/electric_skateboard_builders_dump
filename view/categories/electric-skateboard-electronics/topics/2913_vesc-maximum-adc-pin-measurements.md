What's the maximum voltage that can be measured on the two ADC ports on the VESC?

Most probably the stm microcontroller rail voltage. Google the microcontroller datasheet. Should be on the first few pages.

I did the measurements myself and can confirm that 3.3 v is the maximum, for anyone else wondering.
