Does the wiring for an antispark switch matter? Not the inline parts but the push button itself. Wanting to put the button near the front top of the board

Lots of guys have the button up top or on the front truck baseplate man.  Should be fine.

typically it's fine, I have 2 boards where the switch has 18in of wire between it and the PCB.  Make sure the button is always plugged in when you have power connected.  also make sure the switch is in the off position when you connect power.
