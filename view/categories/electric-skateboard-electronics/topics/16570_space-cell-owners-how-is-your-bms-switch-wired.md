Hey guys, I bought the BMS and MOSFET switch that @onloop uses in the newer SPACE Cells to use in my new build as I wanted a basic BMS just for charging but unfortunately it didn't come with any instructions showing how to wire the components to a battery.

Was hoping that someone out there with a SPACE Cell wouldn't mind taking a few photos of their battery wiring so I can work out how the BMS and switch are supposed to be wired to the battery and charging circuit?

Here's a photo of the ones that I have:

Cheers

Yea I did look at that thread, I wasn't sure if that was the one he was referring to though as it doesn't really include any photos that're useful to me
