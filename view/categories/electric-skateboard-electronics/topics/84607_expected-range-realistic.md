Hello Guys,

i'm quite unsure about my battery situation.

I have 2x Turnigy High Capacity 12000mAh 6S 12C LiPo packs
And 2x 6374 Motors 16T Motor Pulley and MAYBE a 72T Wheel Pulley with 8inch pneumatics.

My Goal is to achieve 40-60km/h and the most possible range with these batterys.

What range can i expect if i use them in series/parallel. I've tried different esk8 calc and get different results. between 25 and 47km
If i use them in parallel just because of the range, would i technically still be ably to reach 40+ km/h?

Minimum Capacity:  <strong>12000mAh</strong>
Cell Count: <strong>6 / 22.2V</strong>
Constant Discharge:  <strong>12C</strong>
Peak Discharge (10sec):  <strong>24C</strong>
Pack Weight:  <strong>1650g</strong>
Pack Size:  <strong>183 x 77 x 58mm</strong>
Charge Plug:  <strong>JST-XH</strong>
Discharge Plug:  **XT90**

You can pick one or the other, but with 12C batteries, I'd go 6S and pick longer range.  You won't get top speed from these batteries.

Watt hours determines range but what @b264 is saying is that at 6s you'll be going slower and get better efficiency but if a 12s and 6s setup use all the same parts that would impact range (wheels and motors etc ) and are geared to the same speed you will get the same range

I dunno how accurate that is cause it says my average range is 28miles but I know that's false and a very very low estimate. 

I run  20-25mile rides every week on my 12s8p and  I'm usually somewhere in the 75-70% range battery life when I'm done. In fact I don't always charge my board before a ride cause I just don't need to. 

That estimate for me seems very very off.

Well you can't compared a lipo or premade battery to just cells there is other parts and tools that you need. To make 1 battery will cost alot if you don't have the tools. The money you pay for labor and experience in making the battery is important too.  It's not just about raw materials.

from my experience normal riding on urethane is about 10wh/km. With pneumatic it might be lower. Your 500wh battery should get you 40+km range.

Okay here is a picture of a ride i logged 16 watt hours per mile
For reference I am using a single drive 245kv sk8 motor 8s lipos 16/36 and kegel wheels and weigh about 140 pounds ![esk8|690x297](upload://m3l4AxP05W2VKWaMNpnn6FxzyyH.png)
My point i guess is 10 wh/km is extreme but 26 watt hours per mile might be more than a lot of people use in a mile

Edit: I'm an idiot the analyzer for some reason says 26 watt hours per km when set to metric and 16 watt hours per mile when set to imperial (the math says the 16 watt hours per mile is right which is 10 watt hours per km)

Well I'm on pneumatics, too and draw 10.5 -12 Wh/km. Running a chain drive, about 3 bar (~45 psi) on 9" (which is kinda high preasure for 9") but only 45 km/h top speed and 25 km/h average.(many people with pneumatics have channel trucks overall don't ride >50 km/h)

You also  have to keep in mind that you can pump pneumatics up quiet a bit and staying below say 40km/h for instance improves efficiency drasticly. The highest "loss" on any vehicle on earth is basicly friction, the "drag" of bearings, drivetrain and so on are more or less constant, pneumatics actually improve in efficiency at higher speeds a little (as long they are controllable and don't burst into pieces) but the highest friction is air resistance which is rising drasticly at higher speeds. 
The air resistance at 40 km/h is 4x times higher as at 20 km/h and 16x times from 10 km/h, it quadruples by speed. Riding 38 km/h on average or 24 km/h makes a huge difference regarding efficiency, max. Amperage on the otherhand not that much you don't draw 45A beside a acceleration spike here and there. Stop and go of course is also a range killer for obvious reasons.

Here is me getting 7.5wh/km on trampa urban treads on 90  PSI lol
I have since dropped the PSI to 65 and efficiency has gone to like 8.5wh/km
I am gonna drop down to 50 PSI and see how that goes. 

But I am 70 kilos all in and more of a cruiser than a top speed demon. I like to take my surroundings in as I ride.

The thing with gearing for such a high top speed that you might occasionally use is that you will have to pay the price in lower torque throughout the acceleration curve.

I wouldn't say **no boosted rider ever** gets 7 miles out of a standard range pack. The people who get 4 miles out of one are the people riding at full throttle the whole way. But there are also people content to go slower who manage to get 7 miles. Although I do think esk8 company's shouldn't just be advertising the highest possible range, because then people think no matter how they ride they should get that number. Instead I would give 2 range numbers 1 for aggressive riding and the other for the max range you can squeeze out of it. But I know they won't do that because they want sales and most people don't look further than the basic specs.

i personally think all esk8 should be tested at a airport/ flat road going full speed until battery is dead and i think the person testing it should be 180 pounds

but than again every company would need to change because if one company tested this way their specs would be considerably lower then other companys.

sry for the wording

I mean it would be nice to have a standard way of measuring range wouldn't it. I just wish manufacturers would state the watt hours of their batteries without me having to dig through google. Also the problem i see with this is a board that can only go 20 mph will go at 20 and a board that can go 25 will have to go 25 so the faster board will be using more power to overcome air resistance. So I don't think it would be an equal test maybe all boards tested on a flat road with a 180 pound rider goon the same speed. But again they're driven by sales so they're going to advertise inflated specs.

Yah assuming everything is mechanically aligned well and you're not losing energy from belts rubbing or worn bearings or anything like that then most of the power is just in accelerating your mass (which just depends on your mass, friction, and the incline).  Ideally you wouldn't brake though would use all the energy to keep going forward, when braking we get some power back but it's not 100% efficient always bleeding off power as heat when it moves through components.

Also I get around the average range maybe a little better riding on urethane and mostly flat land around here I get about 7Wh/km (also I always kick off or jump on so the board isn't accelerating me from 0)

Well hit 20mph at peak during the cruise but also lots of 0mph time while in the store with board idling outside.

Graph there doesn't show the whole ride very well in embedded view https://metr.at/r/GLCvO <-- gives you a better idea seeing the whole thing.

That said I'm admittedly no speed demon, max I've taken it up to is 24mph and that is not a comfortable speed to me.

Yah well I mean I just use it for short cruises to shops around town for the most part not as a thrill ride or to get as far as I can as fast as possible, just saying different use cases for different people.  But yah agree board setup makes a big difference as well, when I did take it up to 24mph was longboard setup but have since switched to an old school "pool deck" and not nearly as comfortable at speed if I wanted to push it.

yeah thats why no boosted rider ever gets a actual 7 miles in range, thats why people only get 4 miles of actual range on a boosted the key word is advertised
[/quote]

I'm only reporting what's written on boosted's site.  Me and plenty others are getting 10wh/km or better.  So you're wrong again buddy.

from my experience normal riding on urethane is about 10wh/km

this was originally what we were about and that is not an average of what normal people are getting.

tah dah

My Goal is to achieve 40-60km/h and the most possible range with these batterys.
[/quote]

hes not looking to ride like you he trying to achive the most range at that speed which is around 25wh/mile

hes not trying to ride 10mph like you and at 40-60km/h 10wh/km is not possible

so can i say your wrong? or did you not read fully.

Yah wasn't trying to argue about the possible range or range or efficiency here either was just throwing in my 2 cents and experience.  Like you said the ride style, rider (I'm only like 115lbs) and conditions (riding on smooth roads in west suburb at edge of Chicago almost entirely flat) are going to effect the actual numbers.
