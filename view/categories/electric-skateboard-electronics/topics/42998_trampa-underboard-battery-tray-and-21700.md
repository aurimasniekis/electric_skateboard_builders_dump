Your loss tbh, they might cost a bit upfront but the investment is worth it for the durability, craftsmanship and support you get ü§∑

You can find mass produced plastic enclosures from under US$ 20, but I feel compelled to tell you why the price is right.

I manufacture each of my enclosures by hand, it takes me around 2-3 days to make just one, I mean create them from scratch, finish the edges, correct imperfections and seal them before painting and test fit them. The materials I use are top notch in order to archive rigidity and flexibility at the same time, this, at the end, should give you good durability, the mounting holes will hold the securing bolts and won't crack, the countour of each enclosure will follow the shape of each deck perfectly so you won't need to overtight screws and force the enclosure in order to seal the gaps. I also need to let you know the design process is the longest part, it has taken me sometimes even months to design them, the art you see on the external surface on each enclosure is created by me by following the spirit of each deck and the feel I want to project on each of my works:

For instance you have the spine look of the Evo Falcon series:

Or the Lamborghini rear motor vents of the Century 40"

The trampa enclosure takes me the longest time as it like making 7 enclosures everytime the ammount of flexible resin is also increased in order to avoid cracks caused by the constant flexing of the deck.

If it is about 10s2p, even plastic may not cause problems.
However, the larger the battery pack, such as 12s5p, the more the enclosure is asked for strength and durability.
I prefer large battery packs, so I can not compromise the enclosure.
Given the possibility that the enclosure may break due to vibration and the battery may fall, it is safer to buy a solid enclosure.
The Eboosted EVO DS enclosure can support 12s10p without any problems.
It is a battery pack of about 6kg.
I thought it was expensive shopping, but it is much stronger and safe than making it with a 3D printer.
