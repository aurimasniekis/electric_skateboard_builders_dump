I assembled my esk8 last week and I rode for an hour withouth problem. Yesterday my friend was testing and it stopped. When he come back a phase motor wire was loose. I connected again but not response from the motor.
I have check all the conection, I've tried another motor and still no response. Also I've changed the battery for a power supply in order to check all the component so I tend to think that the problem is in the Vesc but not sure.
My Vesc is a 4.12 turnigy.
There are apparently no burnt or damage component. I can connect to PC and receive response. Light green/blue ON. No faults on terminal. Firmware updated again.
Everything seem OK but when I try to config the motor no spin nor other sound.
Any advice in how to confirm that is my VESC that is broken?


Setup:
sk3 6374 168kv
2x6s 4,5 lipo turnigy 40c
vesc 4.12 turnigy
BMS (Chinese bypassing) -> Removed to test

With everything plugged up and on, check to see if your fet on the vesc is getting hot. If so, its popped inside.

Do you have a voltmeter? If so, check voltage throughout the system. You may have a loose connection on the vesc or leads in motor came off.... Not being able to see it does leave us in the dark though.

Yes, I tested in all points and everything seem correct except inside the VESC because it has the transparent insulate. I will broke to test it but the VESC indicates a correct voltage.
I've added some screenshots in the first post.

thats good...no DRV fault. did you try to do motor detection again?...just for the sake of it

edit: just saw that you tried that

@DaniRC
Try to reset the values to default and then give it a try.
Also check by re-flashing the fimeware on FOCBOX again

It think that is a DRV problem. I've broken the insulate because it had an sticker and I wan't able to see the last corner. Although I don't have any DRV fault, it seem that it is burned.

@DaniRC These ESCs are not good. Have you tried FOCBOX?

No yet but I'm going to buy a new Vesc. Don't have focbox the drv issue? It cost more than double with shipping to Spain.. Three times if I include the additional warranty :cold_face:
