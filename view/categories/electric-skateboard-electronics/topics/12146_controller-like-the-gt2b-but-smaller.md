So i have the 2.4ghz pistol grip quanum Or how ever its spelt. I have this comtroller and inside the electronics are tiny! Anyone got some ideas for a small enclosure? Just need to cut the trimming stick thing down a bit. The only issue is it requires 4*AAA batteries. I cant be bothered to put a Lipo or liion cell inside. Can i solder AAA battery terminals together? 

Cheers! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/a/eac4d73511adb0d187bca7deee3b5d263287db70.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/9/2944d6beca889fa760c4e2e4c9f3edee0877a87b.jpg" width="375" height="500">my hand is for size comparison haha.

In the top right corner is a search bar. Type in "gt2b mod"
Not so hard

The problem is that it isn´t a gt2b so the pcb and the parts are different ;)

Ive made a 3d design on 123D design. Looks similar to the boosted/winning/Gt2b enclosure mod.

I was just plaayin lol, but I feel like it is easier to just get the gt2b which is really cheap anyway and just get a gt2b mod. No need to worry about AAA batteries as well.

That remote is so annoying because it sucks batteries so much you have to replace them every other ride

Yes that's an issue for me too, and it's not fun when you're halfway on your ride :frowning:
