Hey folks,
I checked upon my battery % today and the screen didnt turn on, neither did the motors get any juice.
Yesterday it worked perfectly and nothing strange happened.
Any instant suggestions?

Battery looks the same as always
Thanks for any help

Edit: If I press onto it with my finger next to the button, it turns off (after just working again)
When I press onto it again, the battery turns on.
It is in between the screen and the button where it shuts down or turns on again.

@onloop

Could be that the BMS switch is broken somehow from what you described.
