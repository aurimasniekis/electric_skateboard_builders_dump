A case of 200 cells for $700, shipped from Cali, could be good for you US-side Battery builders. Much cheaper than on Nkon or INRbatteries.

The only downside I see is that they are not wrapped, and so there's some extra labor in that. 

I dont know, thought i'd share as i know i'd get in on it if i was still stateside
