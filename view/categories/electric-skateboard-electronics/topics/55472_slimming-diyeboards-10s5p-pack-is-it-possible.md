Hi guys,

I want to upgrade my current LiPos to diyeboards 10s5p (http://www.diyeboard.com/10s5p-18650-lithium-battery-pack-36v-10ah-360wh-with-charger-p-655.html). But as you can see in the photos its 52mm thick. is there a way to slim this down? has anyone done this before?

Thanks,
```

There’s a way but it would require rewiring or re spot welding the joints.

10s5p with 360wh that's sad i would not waste my money on that pack. My 10s4p has 432wh and my 12s4p has 532wh both have less cells than a 10s5p

Be aware that this pack has a max amp discharge rating of 50a. Not sure if upgrade is the right term for replacing your lipos in this case.

I bought the 10S5P diy-eboard battery as a noob purchase. Recently it got water damaged and I took it appart. The Nickel strips are rusting, so they are of quite bad quality. The cells are LG MF1 which are low on amps and capacity. This battery is not worth it.
@darkkevind is located in the UK, he can build you a quality pack, i think asking him is worth a try.

If you ask that but only give those informations, I think you must keep reading the forum or just read a lot more to understand what you're talking about/asking for.

I'm aware of the cells in the pack and their amps output. The reason why i want to buy this is because its very cheap.

I mean this pack... Not a good Upgrade  if you can't handle the sag you get already.

@moon found good sells on sale. So maybe look into the buy cells DIY pack. Or buy sells ask someone to put it together.

If you have a single drive setup 45A should be doable with this pack. At least their specsheet claims so.
But i recently pulled the pack apart and the BMS is tiny, so i doubt that 50A is possible. 
Try it and if you experience cut outs lower the battery amps.
The LG MF1 cells are rated for 10A discharge in theory you should be good for 50A continous.
