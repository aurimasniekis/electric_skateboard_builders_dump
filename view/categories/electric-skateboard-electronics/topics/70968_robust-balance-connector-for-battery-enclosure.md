Hello,
I am looking for experience and suggestions. I'd like to leave my batteries without BMS and use a charger with balance port. 
To do this, I'll have to build a connector on my battery enclosure to make the balance leads accessible from the outside. What connector would you suggest ? computer DB excluded ...

Have you experience using these for example :

I would say anything that can handle more than 5a. VGA port maybe, what you linked looked pretty good too

HDMI is to transport digital signal. I don't think it is rated for high current ? I checked, it is 0.5A. This is below the limit ... USB is not that much better wrt to current rating.
Thanks for the suggestions :slight_smile:

I ordered a Chargery C4012B which has 12s charging capability. There are two 6s balance cables for 1 to 6 and 7 to 12. Building the battery with cables out for charging.
