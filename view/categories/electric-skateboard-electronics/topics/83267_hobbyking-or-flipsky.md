Evening all,

If you had a choice between HK or Flipsky 6355 motors, which brand would you choose and why? It‚Äôs basically between these two due to budget.

Cheers,
Shaun

Hobbyking, if you go for sk3 or sk8 motors.
I heard not so good things about flipsky motors.
They seem to break fast

For motors definetely HK. Sk3 still one of the best and most tested motor out there.

@rey8801 Thanks. Would you go sk3 over sk8? I was hoping to have sensors. Would you just install the sensors in the sk3?

I would go for sk8. They are very reliable. And they have sensors already installed :slight_smile:

If you have the space then sk8 is made for Esk8. Sealed, with a fan and sensored. Just watch out to the truck because it needs space. Sk3 is more compact but not selead.
Sensors are easy to install but you need to buy the pcb. Still really cheap but you have to design it.

SK3 and SK8 are both the same size at 6474 and measure 89mm outside dimension so the 55 variant will probably be just as under advertised so be careful when choosing your trucks.  The sk8 is a smoother motor right through the power range but the sk3 seem more punchy.  Both great units but my early versions of the sk8 had issues.  One had a bearing fail which destroyed the sensor pcb and then the vesc due to a short and one had a sensor fail.  Later versions are still going strong though and HK are the best for replacements.  sk3 are solid and reliable and make the best sound in esk8 imo.

@Mich21050 @rey8801 @dareno thanks for the info, guys!

I‚Äôve got some e-Calibers which have slightly longer axles. This is my first build so not sure if they will fit or not. I‚Äôm also going to machine my own mounts so have a bit of flexibility in that respect. I will have to suck it and see so to speak!

6355 and e caliber should be fine.  They don't fit the larger versions though.  Pics of the mounts or it didn't happen lol

@dareno Haha, it‚Äôs a bit like that to be honest! Especially when they are so many nice options out there. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a cheap UK made mount available. I‚Äôm in the process of drawing something up :slight_smile:
