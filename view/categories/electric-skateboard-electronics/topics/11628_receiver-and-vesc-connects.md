You plug one end of the servo wire that @Jinra linked into your receiver and then the other end into the three pins that are sticking out from the VESC in the upper left hand corner of this picture:

I'm not too familiar with the GT2Bs or if there are multiple manufacturers (so please correct me if I'm wrong anyone), but watch this video to learn how to bind the receiver to the transmitter:
