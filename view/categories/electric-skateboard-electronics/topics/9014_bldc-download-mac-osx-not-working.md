The link for the OS X download on the BLDC download website isn't working, is there another way to download it? I used to have the BLDC tool but i must have deleted it.

No worries. You can always find it using the directory of his site. However for the purpose of keeping his site functioning the way he intended it's best to try that button first.

The screenshots show iOS and not OSX, though it says it's for OSX. And when I download that file it's .exe which is not for OSX...

So confused.

Happened to me too. But I downloaded it again and it came as a .dmg file.

.exe all day long. 

When I click "older versions" they're all "Windows" and .exe also. I'm guessing the link is setup wrong.
