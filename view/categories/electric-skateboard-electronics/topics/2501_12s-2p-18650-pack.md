Check the max continuous A per cell....if it 10A you may consider 3 or better 4p for 40 amp draw.....even if it's 20 continuous - to reduce stress it seems 3p at min. Better safe than sorry. I'm thinking I'm building a 10s5p - crazy range and not as taxing amp wise

I would recommend having it on 8s 3p because these batteries dont have enough discharge rate. Longboard esc can run cooler with higher top speed but gives tons of stress to batteries. You wont get the agressive punch torque either.

If distance isn't a priority, you could consider a 12s1p with  26650 cells instead.   Usually their current ratings are higher than you would find in a 18650.

Also,  I think the tacon 160 maxes out at 10s but I could be wrong.

running this esc http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idproduct=56255
with an 8s 3p would be better than running a 6s4p?

I almost bought that ESC when it was for sale for about $60-70. It looks mean, but the one e-board build I found online that used it needed a new esc very quickly.
