ok so get a voltage meter and test each cell - if the one that you shorted in particular is weaker than the others then you should take it out. The others look fine... but your soldering could use some improvement. Anyways, as long as it was momentarily the overall pack still looks usable to me

check the voltage and if it's​ too much drift, balance them, and that's it, usually nothing happens if is a momentary short.
It happened to me too with the same cells when I was making the pack, and is running for more than 500km, no issues.
Enjoy!!
