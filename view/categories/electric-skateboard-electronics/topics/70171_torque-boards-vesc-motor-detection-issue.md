Hey, all.

I've been running this double belt drive setup for a few months now. Yesterday she shut down at speed. After scraping myself off the pavement I checked my board. If I pushed the throttle one motor would move a little and the other would be still. After pulling it apart I found that the Master Vesc would blink a red light 3 times when the throttle or break were engaged. Plugging it in it failed to detect the motor but isn't giving any fault messages in the console. Any clues where to start? I tested with both motors and the slave moved both, they also are hand turn-able like normal.
