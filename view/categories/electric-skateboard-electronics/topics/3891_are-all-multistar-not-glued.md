Ive had the smaller multistar pack, around 5ah 6s, and the cells weren't glued together.  I've heard from other people they also got multistar with no glue.  How bout you?  How bout this big cell?

The cells are not glued which is nice in my application because I like to take them apart. 

Pretty small for a 10ah 6s. I guess because they have a super low discharge rate.  They're smaller than my 8ah 6s zippy packs

Have u ever opened up these particular 16ah packs?  They're weak cells but with 12s and 16ah I think they'll be good

Awesome pack! I have over 200 cycles on mine and even dropped to 3.0 volts once. Still fine. Not sure if glued though

I wouldnt call 10C constant with 20C peak weak. That like 160A constant discharge with 320A peak. Much more curren than a skateboard should need.

Compare that to my zippy 5000s (which apparently arent weak) which are 100A constant.  
How is 160A weaker than 100A?


Edit. Sorry didnt mean to derail the thread.. but my 10000 multistars were not glued.

Yea not weak with so many ah. Shouldn't continue their weak sauce stereotype. 
So far everyone's are not glued.  These cells are huge. Want to do a version similar to what I think u or someone here did with resoldered cells.  Making a deck to go with them. See how slim I can get these.

Do u have the 16ah pack? If so... Could u try sliding a credit card up a bit on the end and see?  It could make or break this plan

I would but my packs are sealed up in my abs case. I sealed the outside to make it watertight so removing it would be a pain

I think I will dive in. 

I think the cells are splittable with a credit card if need be anyway. Right? someone?  I don't want to do that though

```
the difference between the 16ah and the 10ah is that the 16ah actually has parallel groups going on (hence the 6s **2p**) while the 10ah only has single cells (6s1p). So I'm interested to see if they glued the parallel cells. I'm also curious how they layered the cells with wiring the parallel and serial cells.
This is because I am interested in buying the 6s2p packs to slim down instead of making my own 18650 packs (which requires purchasing a spot welder).

That's my plan as well. 
It's 2p but strangely is almost the same size as the 12ah pack that's 6s as well. How this is possible or if it's a misprint I'd like to know. 

About weak sauce though and 160amp possibility..these cells as well as most lipo have exaggerated c ratings.

Yes they are removable with a credit card. I use a plastic protractor because of the curve it has. Makes it easier to cut the double sided tape holding the cells together

there is no glue anywhere in the 16Ah multistar packs. I repacked one not too long ago to fit in my 6S rat board. 

i ever did a thread to discuss if it really was weaksauce or if it was the perfect commuter pack. I top out at 25mph on it and it has a range of over 20 miles. Not slow 20 miles either, like 18-20mph 20 miles which is ideal for a commute.

Good to hear. Thank you. Could u do me another favor and please tell me if the dimensions they post are correct? Strange that the size is almost the same as the 12ah

i didn't measure the pack before i split it open and laid it out side by side, but IIRC the dimensions were accurate. That is to say it wasn't longer or shorter or thicker than expected.

Thanks .  How they get 4 more ah into practically the same shape is surprising.   I'll be buying two myself

i think they are limiting the discharge rate somehow. its full of sorcery that i don't understand.

The 12ah is not glued.  But if you split the lipo, the battery tabs are aluminum and cannot be normally soldered.  You need aluminum flux and solder.  The balance wires might be too short too.

yeah i did have a hard time soldering them... even with a 75 watt iron. but it is doable, i did it, and i did it with real lead + tin flux core solder.

I've soldered tabs with a monster iron and 60/40 solder as well and it was hard.  I think it'd be easier to just clamp the tab and wires with something and I've heard of that being done.
  How they get more juice in the same size envelope...I think it simply has to be more juice and no way around it

yeah I read somewhere that someone used crimping and worked pretty decently, kinda looks like it was spot welded-ish, but much cheaper.

Is it as easy as 60/40?  Does it take more heat. I'll do the aluminum solder probably...never heard of it
Don't want anything to possibly come undone with simply compression.  Too risky.

my first solder joint on the bridge i made to split the packs did break while i was riding, and i had to go back in there. 

maybe i will order som aluminum solder and see what's up with that. Do you need a hotter iron for aluminum solder in addition to the different flux?

It does take a good amount of heat but a 60 watt iron can handle it. 
Do a search for "how I made my lipo packs slimmer" and you'll see that I linked the aluminum solder that I used.

I first used solder paste which was shit but then I found actual solder

4Kg or 9Lbs for 12s2p 16Ah!

can you tell us the verdict about the parallel cells? how are the parallel cells connected? and how thin did you split them? single or double? do you have photos? The only photos I can find online are of the 6s1p packs but not the 6s2p..

I just ordered them. Ended up getting (3) 4s packs. 16ah. They ran out of the 6s packs and I look and the 4s ones are cheaper anyway. Surprise.  There's a world of batteries over there. I'll tell u when I get them from the west coast distributor.

Pictures please!

If the form factor and deisgn is good, these could be great for rebuilding/reforming into slimmer packs for eBoards

I got them a while ago.  They aren't glued!  They sit here, I think ill use my other batteries instead in fact I think I'm going to try to get rid of them.  It's a huge pack and a great deal but at some point it becomes so huge that it's ...too huge.  If ur around San Fran and want it for 20$ less than I paid its here and unused
