Hello, I’m currently having issues with my board. This happens randomly but somethings when I brake I can go back like 50 percent throttle to start feeling the braking feeling. However randomly on some rides. I get start breaking like 10percent throttle. And the board just hits the break as if it’s 100%. Idk if this is firmware related? I used the vesc tool to configure. Any help would suffice!
