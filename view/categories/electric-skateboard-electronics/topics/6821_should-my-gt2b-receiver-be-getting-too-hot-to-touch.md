Hi team, I was able to test out the electronics of my set-up very briefly a few days ago, however I noticed that my receiver was getting very hot shortly after being plugged in. I don't see it mentioned on here when I search for "hot receiver", so I'm just wondering if its normal. It seems like a ridiculous operating temperature for such a small part, hopefully it's normal.

Thanks guys

Do you have the ground wire plugged in correctly?  You might need to flip the wires around so each wire is lined up correctly to the receiver.
