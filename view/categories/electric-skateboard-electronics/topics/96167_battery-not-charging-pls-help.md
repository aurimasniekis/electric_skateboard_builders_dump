Trying to charge 7s3p lithium battery. The charger is a 2A, 29.4V charger. This is going thru a BMS into the battery.

The battery is not charging and the charger has a flashing red light...anyone have any ideas please ?![15599994558474810845392003546084|690x388](upload://i1nzCYbEjvrWWMDUSJ7K6kOa7zu.jpeg)

Check battery voltage before bms.

Probably a dead charger. Is the bms accepting charge?



I have a spare 7s 2a charger for sale in the usa if you want
