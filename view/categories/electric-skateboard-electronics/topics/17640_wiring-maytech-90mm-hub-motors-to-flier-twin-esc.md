After spending an afternoon trying to figure out the correct wiring for the Maytech 90mm hub motors to Flier 120A Twin ESC, I wrote [a blog post](https://kaspars.net/blog/electronics/maytech-hub-motor-flier-esc-wiring) and created this diagram:

Here is [my video review](https://kaspars.net/blog/electronics/maytech-90mm-motor-review) of the Maytech 90mm hub motor and the [photos from the teardown](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kasparsdambis/sets/72157678865233335):

I'll be doing another build video when moving all of the electronics to a larger deck since the 90mm wheels are way too big for this E-Wheelin i3 / Elwing deck.

Looks like their [Aliexpress store](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1630416) is all empty now. I'm not sure when it's going to be up again.
