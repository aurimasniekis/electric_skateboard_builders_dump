The description says metal or plastic. Which is it? Because that's going to make a big difference whether or not they're any good. Also,  this is an auction. You said you ordered a few sets, how much did you pay?

Edit, I read further. $75,  not bad. But they have 12mm bearings and will only fit mountainboard trucks.

Thanks @paragon seems like a good deal! Aluminum and CF. One would need mountainboard trucks though. Maybe these are the wheels for my next A/T build! EDIT: @psychotiller already noted that they are for MB trucks :)

The Ground Industries Terraintula wheels are aluminum with carbon fiber.
The Crosshair hubs are plastic.

Yeah, I'll be using the new MBS ATS.12 truck (http://shop.mbs.com/accessories-486/mountainboard-trucks-suspension/mbs-ats12-truck-system.html). $35 per truck doesn't seem bad, and the holes for the braking system could be used for motor mounting.

According to this http://www.surfingdirt.com/forum/showthread.php?t=437 and similar threads, they last much longer than MBS tires.
