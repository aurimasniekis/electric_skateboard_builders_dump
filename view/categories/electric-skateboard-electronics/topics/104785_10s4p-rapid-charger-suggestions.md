So Im new too Eskate and i recently purchased a miles rampage but all the internal electronics seem to be the same as the raldey. It's got a 10s4p battery. I like the board but I ride alot and was looking for a faster charger. It came with a 42v 2a and my question is can I get a faster charger without damaging anything? If so how many amps can I push and any recommendations on quality charger. Thank you in advance.
