Just bought this puppy the other day. I am running a 10s setup with 190kv...let's see if it works or explodes ;) Just seller said it would be compatible. :smile: I slightly pessimistic but who knows! It could be a wonderfully cheap solution, stay tuned!

Thanks! This one is for science.... He said it has a 40amp rating...So I am expecting to be ok on cruise and slow accelarations. However, I do know that my amps will momentarily spike above 40 (roughly 45amps) on fast accelarations. I know this becuase I did a treadmill test with the VESC plugged into my laptop x)

Did the seller say if the ESC would limit the amount of amps pulled by the motor to 40 amps? Or will the ESC just give the motor as many amps as it wants until the ESC blows itself up?

I'm  may consider using it for a beater board if it turns out not to be complete crap. Keep us updated on how it does.

So, I bought one of these and tested it on a 10s setup. Rode it around for about 5 minutes then rode to my mailbox, which is about 100' from my garage. It got super hot after that short time period. Also, if you've ever used the Sleeping Lion 12s ESC, the breaks are very similar. All or nothing unless you really ease into the brakes. Not sure it's very safe if you're used to a VESC. I still have yet to try the dual.(which I also purchased)

i built another board for a friend with a 10s Lipo setup, he seems to be perfectly happy with the board.

but he mentioned that one time one motor stopped working after very heavy load. He told me that just manually turning the wheel fixed it. and he hasn't had a problem since. only 1 cycle on it tough...

there might be some luck with these boards.

I have mine for around 3 weeks now and i must say that it is working perfectly.
The braking is perfect, same for acceleration.

Only problem i have is that when I put it on the 10s battery setting, there is to much torque at initial throttle to depart safely with my 27inch board but I tried with a big longboard and it works fine.

Honestly I also have 2 vescs laying around and I stil go for this one, only if it was for the ease of the switch.

Have had no issues with the controller up till now.

let me know if you have some questions.

I do apologize. It has been quite hectic lately so I have not gotten around to updated this thread...

Regardless, I recieved my board and put it to the test. Here are some videos and photos:

This is how it arrived (without the package in this pic). It has a Xt60 connect soldered to the board so I changed it out to an xt90 to fit my board.

My quick thoughts:

Three small problems
- If you dont understand them, brakes are a bit tough on the low end (The acceleration and brake curves are steep)
- There is a low voltage cutoff, this I know. Yet, I am not entirely sure what it is set at and there is no way to adjust it. I did not test it out as I was not trying to overdrain my batteries...
- At 10s, this module heats up considerably. I do know heat is bad, but I have ridden the shit out of my board with the controller and have had no problems yet...AKA I have not been able to break it. However, I am only 160 and a heavier riding could potentially be problematic. 

Nevertheless, this speed controller might be perfect for entry level builders with low budgets. It has all the functions of a VESC with less than half the cost. It provides great acceleration with learnable braking. Just be careful to buy a battery that can handle higher amperage draw as this baby sucks pulls easy amps. Sure, no regenerative breaking or custom adjustments, but if youre looking for device that makes your board move forward, this might be it. 

I suppose the biggest thing right now to do is figuring out the LVC! Anyone know??

Hope this quick review helps,

Marcus

Potentially. But as I said, I do not know the low voltage cutoff on this board...You could potentially overdrain your batteries. It might be worth a few more dollars to get liion with a BMS and have that control your cutoff so you are sure you dont overdrain your batteries...You could really screw yourself over by overdraining.

[/quote]

I have been looking at this same module online and was thinking this may be a good option for introductory level boards. Maybe run them at 8S or 9S instead and use a BMS to protect the pack instead of relying on who knows what settings are on that ESC. With a very simple design a budget board is totally possible with this. 

I look forward to seeing how long this lasts you and how it fails.

Yes, it is entirely possible. But also consider the cost of a BMS that. You want one that can handle the current flow as you would be discharging through it. Provided that will it be around 60 bucks, perhaps it would be better to go with a VESC in the first place?

40 - 60  amp BMSs are about $45 plus shipping, get them in bulk and the shipping starts to drop, it could be done at a macro scale but wouldn't make sense at a micro scale, you're probably right there. 

So you could use a charge only balance board type BMS instead and those can be had state side for cheap sometimes.

I have only ridden the board twice with the dual. Both times on 10s with 6'' pneumatic wheels on rough terrain or grass for a short distance. Both times I had no issues except that it's very slow. I only got up to 15mph, but it will do this on grass or street. It also gets pretty warm after. However, I did have it under an encloser. I think they are worth the money, so far.

Also, Forgot to mention, I switched the battery leads to 10awg. I would have done the motor leads too but you cannot get to them. Plus, they use some really high temp solder. It took me a 1/2 hour with a 50w soldering iron to do the battery leads.

I don't plan on modifying past a heat sink I found kn amazon for $13. I believe that will alleviate all issues with heat from the 10s pack. I shouldn't be concerned with the voltage shutoff if the battery has a bms correct?

Yes if you have a bms you won't have to worry about the lvc. Just letting you guys know that on the page where you buy it, it says that it is only for 10s, 7s and 6s and you can only use the one you ordered it for unless you desolder something and solder something else it's not very clear (something to do with the pictures)

I'm planning a new build with this esc.
I will use a 10S battery and my plan is to use the esc until it stops working (maybe it will work well I don't know) and then just replace it with a vesc.

Now my question is does anybody know if you can still use the remote for the vesc? Because the receiver from the cheap esc is build in the print I guess?
If not I will just buy a mini remote but maybe somebody knows about this ''winning'' style remote :slight_smile:

I am assuming it is an 80 amp max draw? You'll never hit 80 amps, it will most likely peak 50-60 depending on weight. Depends what cell number you are running 6s-10s, but possibly.

It is more like 45amps. If it is 1350w esc and you are using 6s then it will be 50ish because 1350/25.2 = 53.57amps but if your using 12s then it with be on 27ish because 1350/50.4 = 26.78amps so it really depends what pattern you are using

You just wont be able to reach the full output / power of the motor.. thats how it should be in theory.. non the less, unless u wanna go uphills really fast, u might not need / see more than 1000W of usage..Depends on ride conditions and so on of course.. but still

I tried the single belt drive version with a SK3 6374 - I know it's not rated for that.
Not terribly impressed. 
Might be OK on flats, it would not pull me up braking down a moderate hill. In fact I was still accelerating while at full brake. I weigh about 78kg. Once it got going on a flat it was OK. Set for 10s 15/36 gearing. I think I found a thermal cut out up a hill though,
Am waiting on a dual version to try with twin sk3 6355's where again, I will try and roast it. for science.

The fact that there's airflow at all should already be a great improvement. And considering the VESCs even without direct fets don't really tend to overheat, I feel like a bottom mounted one should be sufficient.

If you want wind to hit the sink, maybe mount the electronics towards the front of the board with the first 1/5 of the enclosure being aluminum? Or maybe even an all aluminum enclosure a la metroboard. It could help dissipate heat off the cells as well.

After a 200 meter trip (the very first couple of meters/brand new) the motors just suddenly stopped. The board shut down completely/no lights/no connection to remote. After turning the board on again, it immediately shut down again after applying throttle. 

Now, it is as recorded/see above mentioned YT video.

Did around 8km right now and voltage dropped from 41V to 38V so that seems fine like, It's not a big battery pack (190Wh) but I think I can do like 16km with this.
Esc felt pretty good and strong enough for me (95kg), good acceleration and super strong breaks when you fully hit the brakes.
It's nice that you can switch from low to high speed mode on controller which also makes the acceleration much softer in low mode.
Controller feels very good and also nice that there are 3 led's indicating the battery of the board.
The esc was beeping when the battery was empty and measured the voltage -> 34V so that's perfectly fine for my lipo pack

I have never had a VESC, only FVT120A which I'm using for a long time and worked great for me.
It feels almost the same only motor is much more quite with ebay esc and acceleration curve feels better in my opinion. Great esc for 40â‚¬ ðŸ˜Š

[/quote]

So it was doing that for you too? Here I thought something was wrong with my bms/battery pack when it started cutting off at 34V during testing (bms is 28V cutoff). I messaged the ebay seller and he said the cutoff was set to 30V for the esc. I'm using li-ions, so I'll be losing a ton of range if it keeps cutting off at 34V :( Gotta do more testing.

Yeah it's just to warn you that the batteries are empty and after a while the power cuts off.
But the 34V is a measurement after riding, if you're riding and hitting the throttle the voltage will drop a few volts so it can be possible that the esc cuts off at 30V.
I don't really think you will get much range out off the last volts, these will drop very fast.
I should keep it like this, it's very safe for your batteries and you got a double security with that bms you got.

I also think the esc has an RMP limit.
I have my old motor setup right now for testing and normaly it runs on 6S and now with this esc it's 10S so the calculated max top speed should be around 60kmh.
(Sk3-236kV with 25T-15T and 75mm wheels)
In slow mode I can go 30kmh but in high mode only 40kmh so I think it's just because I'm using such a high kv motor.
I gonna switch to 125kV motor if I received my wheelpulley so that RMP will be fine.

The new pulley should arrive within 2 weeks.

I have used 3 different motors with this esc and max speed was around 40kmh.
I also changed the gearing to hit higher topspeed but wasn't able to get faster. I guess the single motor esc was just running on his highest power and couldn't bring me to higher speed due the max power of the esc.

@Carret 

Iâ€™ve manage 50kmh on this esc using 12s, 190kv, 97mm wheels and 14:27 gear ratio. 

I didnâ€™t like the low amount of torque though and the range I was getting was miserable.

I now have that esc on a single drive 190kv with 10s, 83mm and 2:1 gearing. It has plenty of torque tops out at 40kmh and gets about 20kmh with a 10s 5ah battery.

12s seemed to work fine, it did get a little warm and the motors ran a bit hotter but I would say due to the extra amps from high speeds.

Yep, inefficient is correct all right. I am in the process of upgrading to vescs and 2.7:1 gear ratio. Should have some insane torque
