I was just looking up the regular Steez for a beginner thread on here.(I love that remote !) and saw the "new" type as well on their website. But just from the looks, it looks like a cheaper version of the original ?

Why do you even want it to go another way but back and fourth?

It could control other stuff like signaling lights or what ever like what vedder did with the wii remote and if you are going for a super simple one why not make it small and every thing?

i think about Toyotas a lot since there are three of them in my driveway, so i do see them everywhere. I also see guns everywhere because they're always in the news and people get shot around where i live, so when i see a GT2B or a mini remote, i see a gun. 

How many dildos do you have? Are they all over the house? Is that why you see them?

i'm just trying to figure out what is on the mind of a person who sees this remote and immediately makes the association with a sex toy. You aren't the first person to say this. I'm genuinely curious.
