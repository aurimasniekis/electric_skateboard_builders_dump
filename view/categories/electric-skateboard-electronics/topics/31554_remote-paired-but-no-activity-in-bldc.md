I am setting up a benchwheel remote with my new build and I am having trouble. The remote is paired with the Rx properly but I am getting no activity in the PPM area of the BLDC. Any Ideas? I have watched the esk8 support video on setting up the remote but get nothing.

Wires come soldered onto focbox. Connection going into Rx is 100% correct, White is PPM, Black GND, Red 5V.

Is the receiver flashing rapidly? If not, then you're not connected.

I was able to figure out the issue. When I switched between vesc I did not update all settings.
