Not sure what is going on here...

Neg charge port lead goes to p-
B1 on the bms goes to the neg batt terminal
Pos charge port lead goes to the positive batt terminal. 

There are no other connections to make other that your balance leads.

Voltage out the charger is good? 
Connect the charger and measure the voltage, see if it's dropping when connected. If you have a current clamp you can also measure if there is any current running through the lines.

Could it be a bad led on the charger? Have you let it go for an hour or two and see if it's really not charging

Actually that wasn't me.  I did have an intermittent charging issue one time, but it was a connection issue.

In my case I had a bullet connector somewhere (dont remember off the top of my head where, but pretty sure it was between charge port and bms) that some rosin had dripped down into the the connector while soldering.  It was hard to identify because it worked sometimes.  

Are you getting your full pack voltage through the charge port (careful not to short it)

Did you have continuity on the wires I had you check? You either have: broken charging wires, or one of your cell groups is above 50.4 volts and your bms is stopping the charge to protect it..Or less likely: the bms is bad.

@mmaner I mean donâ€™t try to charge without a BMS all together. Bypassed discharge is fine. Bypassed charge is not. My board would not charge so I removed the BMS. Damages only totaled $2600 but should it have been at night it could have been the life of my family, myself and everyone else staying in the same hotel as I when it happened

I totally understand, but you must realize when you say things like that the perception or understanding become wildly different base on the user.  I, for example, understood your statement to mean "don't do charge only BMS's because you'll die".  As that is not true I was concerned.

I am sorry for the los of your board, that sucks something fierce.  If there's anything I can do to help you get riding again just say the word.

@Blacksheep I really want to help you with this battery, but it really doesn't seem like your doing the things people here have asked you to check(including myself).

@Trdolan03 It's only unsafe if you don't know what you are doing. Sounds like you bypassed your BMS and tried to charge without checking the cell groups individual voltages.

EDIT: To clarify I do recommend everyone use a BMS(its just easier). But if you balance charge and monitor cells consistently it can be safe.

Its a faulty BMS. The BMS is like a switch, when it detects that something is wrong or a group is fully charged it will essentially open the switch. The switch is for some reason not closing, either something wrong with the battery that the bms is detecting or the BMS itself. If you checked all the cell voltages on the balance leads and you checked the voltage across the battery mains and they match, the problem must be the BMS. 

Where and how were you measuring each P group voltage? My recommendation would be to measure this at the bms xh connector. If the voltages here are fine, then the balance wires in the battery are fine. Pin by pin, the voltage should increase by a set amount, 3.25v I believe you said. Then check that against the voltage on the mains. The voltage on the outermost pins of the xh connector should match the voltage on the XT60 connector. If this is true, you can rule out a bad battery and it's either a bad BMS or bad charger. 

Given that, you already tried a second charger with the same results, the issue must be with the BMS. The BMS must not be allowing charge for some reason. Either it's faulty or maybe it's detecting the battery as over discharged

Ok, so this is a 4s Lipo but in theory the wiring is the same. 

![image|375x500](upload://6dfhUydwqMgKaY9k7QeYY456FKK.jpeg) 

The white connector is an XH connector and that is your balancing connector. There is one pin per group that will measure whether your cells are balanced or not. Then on the left the XT60, on your board I imagine its an XT90. Depending on how the battery was made, you will have as many wires on the XH connector as you have S cells or one more. Either way, if you look at the connector from the bottom where you can see the pins like so:

![image|375x500](upload://wjCXZzqFryRGdYr3HjlHF7q07GK.jpeg) 

In this example, the battery is a 4S and there are 5 pins. So the top pin is 0v, then 3.25v, then 6.5v, then 9.75v, then 12v at the bottom. If your xh connector only has as many pins as there are p groups, then you will be missing the top 0v pin and you will measure against the negative on the xt90 

Then the bottom pin should always be at the same voltage as the positive of your XT90 connector.

---
E: The xh connector goes to your bms. Check the pins there. Again, pin to pin, you should be seeing 3.248v and between the positive pin and ground you should see the same as between pos and neg on xt90. 

Let me know what each voltage is showing please. The more detailed the better.
