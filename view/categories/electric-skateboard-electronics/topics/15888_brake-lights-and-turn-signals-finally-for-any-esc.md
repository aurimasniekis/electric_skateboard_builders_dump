I wanted to add turn signals to my esk8 from the beginning, but it turns out this method requires a small hardware modification. probably not a big deal, but I wanted something more **plug and play.**

Finally its here. they have been working for a while now but I haven't gotten around to posting them till now.

Seeing @Michaelinvegas shred light thread take off so fast shows that everyone is looking to do more night rides!  on that note I'm working on headlights but remote control versions are limited by vesc 5v output on this version.

I also def consider it a safety issue...not for nothing I usually were black ... and that's not too smart at night on the street... the only way around it is to either wear lights...or have them on board....I like them on the board üòâ

Yea even If i try not to wear all black while riding sometimes I can't help it most of my jackets are black :sunglasses:

I've been riding with underglow for a few months but still wanted some brake lights because I can.
Going to replace the other rgb with these too. since they are 5v they can run off the rx power no need for an extra buck or remote...


I think group rides are going to get pretty big this year. so many more riders! complete boards are finally almost shipping...haha

Yeah I'm trying to figure out a spring ride with the Vegas group ....

Riding at night is the best I love it

you kinda have to. I did a mid day ride out there, my board did fine but i felt like I was over heating lol

almost made it out for CES but that failed.  :upside_down:



One day we'll have the range for Vegas to Venice beach group ride! lol :joy:

cool because id like multiple. Just for my personal boards.  

Does it function off of the Vesc? or Receiver? If you dont mind me asking :)

its from the receiver so it will work with any esc with 5v bec, I can add a regulator for rc esc's with 6v+ bec.

on the 2nd prototype I even have  2 ch2 splitters built in for dual drives :sunglasses:

I was going to add some 3w led headlights that would also be remote control dimming but a single vesc can only put <1A on the 5v line.

Nicely done! Great job! Also a very good use of these 2812 leds! I still got few of them laying around (single units), did not have proper pcb to solder them onto!

This is awesome! I especially love the turning animations with the flashing arrows! Something that may interest you are these 12V "15W" white head lights I found on eBay. I'm using a similar kind that are "10W" and I love them so far, but I don't think there bright enough so these "15W" ones might be better. http://www.ebay.com/itm/311770165023

Would also love it if you shared maybe some schematics or code, but that's up to you!

P.S. wattage is in quotes because I don't think any of the are actually 10 or 15 watts lol.

those look like overkill lol. these lens i have make a rectanular beam. so you light up full width even close to the ground :sunglasses:

I made these to work on the esc 5v output. the headlight is a 3w led, but it only uses 1.5w at full power.
this leaves just enough current on the vesc 5v for maybe 10-16 rgb leds.

i'm cleaning up the code, and making a schematic. it seem like theres more interest in headlights and brakes. singals were just a easy way to test...

Oh you mean the 15W LED, well there not overkill cause the "10W" ones I have are not bright enough and are not even close to 10W lol. Hopefully these "15W" ones will be good enough.
```

## \#21 Posted by: saul Posted at: 2017-02-02T17:34:14.198Z Reads: 347

they're probably 15w equivalent.. 

these high power leds can do 100+ lumen per watt. 250 lumen is plenty for most places...

still finishing up the schematic and cleaning the code. I made the circuit almost half as small. simple enough that a custom pcb doesn't make sense, yet. at this size it would be pretty cheap...

Is that running off a an attiny85? If so can the Atiny really handle the current draw from those LED's? Would love some documentation as well!

yea its the 85. the headlight has a mosfet for upto 500ma, and leds are ws2801 rgb. so its shared 5v, 1 pwm pin to control. no worries of power draw...just limiting overall current to <800ma for vesc.

I still have some changes to make on the code but the circuit is simple. just a few resistors and pins/connectors/wires.
this is pinout for underglow/brake/turn lights. p4 is unused. i'll update it with mosfet version soon....

about $20-30 on parts depending on led options....

thanks that was the idea.. 
it connects p3 to ground when pressed :nerd:
will be used to configure to a new remote + changing modes  maybe....

for now I've been reprogramming it. but for someone without an isp programmer, or code phobic the button means I can seal away everything and leave reprograming as a bonus, not a requirement.... :sunglasses:

I have enough spare parts to put together a kit, or ready to go set. pm if you're interested.

I want to try some rings next

ok the brake and turn signal version is complete*.

but there is a small limitation that the ch1 input won't be read while animating the leds.
I tried to work around it with code but no real improvements so far.

With the headlight I wanted to have control at all times, but I didn't want to lose the nightrider animations... :thinking:

you should probably slow down or stop if you need to adjust you headlight anyways right?

my first custom pcbs from oshpark! $0.60 cents each! :sunglasses:

about half the size of the perfboard version and saves so much time!
no more button, or jst for leds, soldered leads for a solid connection!

This project got pushed to the back burner for a bit. 
but now its back!

new updated pcb solders directly to the rx of the nano v2.
Brake lights and underglow (headlight hardware done.coming soon in firmware)

Improvements:
better pinout.
easier to solder
gnd/vcc planes added
2x mosfet addon board.

Firmware:
ch1 (Brakes) clean up.
ch2 (lights) interupt drive active high.
