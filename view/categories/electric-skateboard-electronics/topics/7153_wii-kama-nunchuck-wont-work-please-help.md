Did you run a motor detection? Did you set up the configs properly?

If you dont know what i mean just search for vesc here

Have you enabled the nunchuck (and run motor detection) in the VESC settings by connecting it to a computer over USB and running the config tool?

That it lights up just means it has power. The blinks are just dependent on the connection between nunchuck and receiver. This does not mean the output from the receiver is properly set up to be received in the VESC or even properly connected (other than 3.3V of course which seems to be working).

Did you ever read any tutorials here ore elsewhere about VESC config? Or watched one of this YT tutorials? It's quite simple but needs some sense of initiative...
