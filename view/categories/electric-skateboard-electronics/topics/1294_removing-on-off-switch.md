Quick question guys,
I want to remove my on off switch it has 3 leads coming from it. Should I just solder all three of them together to keep the esc always on when there is power? 
I soldered red and white without black and it works but cuts out sometimes (not sure if it's from that) 

I'm installing a loop switch instead.

don't solder all 3 together. you just need to join the ones that are the toggle on the switch. the other one is probably a momentary push for programming transmitter calibration.

you have to look at the switch and see what colours it is toggling. 
I cant see it.

Usually it's red and black for power, but it could be different on yours.
