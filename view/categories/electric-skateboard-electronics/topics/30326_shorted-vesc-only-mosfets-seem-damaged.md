So the insulation came off  the positive battery wire on the smoothing capacitor and touched the USB port and sparks flew, I have a vedder anti spark switch and the fuse blew, hopefully protecting most of it.

Everything looks fine, but I checked the diodes on the mosfets and 4/6 seem to have failed.

Anyone have any idea if it's worth replacing them? or is other stuff likely to be blown. DRV *looks* fine.
