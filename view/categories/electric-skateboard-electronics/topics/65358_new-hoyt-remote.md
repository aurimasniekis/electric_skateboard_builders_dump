So there isn't a lot of info about it, but it looks intriguing.  Everything but the price that is.  $211.  Ouch.

@Michaelinvegas can you convince these guys to do a group buy or a price drop so we can check this  thing out and offer them feedback?  

Hard to want to take a $211 plunge for something..... untested?

Would anyone else be interested in grabbing one of these if the price was right?

I can ask them personally if you like @Sender . I've skated with the owners of that company on the weekends when we do meetups. I've used their board/remote. It's a different take on a remote which is pretty cool.

What are your impressions?

It looks like it could be super comfy in the hand or super annoying.  It does look elegant AF though

It seems like a decent remote. It was a little touchy when I used it, but they said they were working out the kinks. It's just different than any other remote I've used considering it's hockey puck shape. I'll see if they wanna meet up soon and test it out again now that they've finally released it.

Definitely will grab some in depth video. I have some videos on my youtube with their board. I took a couple cuts from it. You can kinda see the size of the remote at the end of the video when he's setting it down.

Seems like 90whr per module for a total of 270whr. easy to fly and don't look like some homemade device.

It is just so damn smoothe.  Such a solid connection, vetter than my Benchwheel by leagues.  AND the modes are actually good! I have 3:
 
1.  Newb mode/last call

2. Drunk mode, and somewhat competent friends

3.   Main fast as shit mode, but smoother than silk with a good throttle curve

Side note, with my benchwheel I would always get "micro dropouts" when I was pushing the stroller with the kids for some reason. It was because how I hold the remote and hold the stroller push bar or something.

That shit is so gone with the Hoyt.  Doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is for me.  I love puahing the stroller with the border. Best way to get the gremlins around!

Maybe get each build name engraved into the remote.  

Where else can you do some shit like that.  Guys, this thing is fucking great. 

I already have to order one for the Ollin Recurve. Quality deck meet quality remotr.  Shit, might try to get OLLIN on the next one!

So you do all of the ppm setup in mode 3, then the other modes are just fractions of that. Pretty dope.  Similar to what other remotes implement, but way better applied.

The remote has 3 modes. I'll check the PPM tab tomorrow and see what the percentages are. 

There's no public coupon to my knowledge. I emailed them and asked for one. I got $50 off, but that was the 2nd remote sold so I'm not sure if that will be common practice or not.

If the connection is as solid like Gt2b, i would buy one. Any pictures of the receiver ?

But i could be worried, that because of the way you are holding the remote in your hand, you are blocking some signal...

So pumped to see this. ive been staring at these remotes since you posted about them..Thank you.. I love the look of it so much. It's so classy. And I have a nano x and the newest maytec  and they both been good so far no drops outs charged them once all summer same charge and really no complaints about them yet other then the trigger being a short throw takes a bit to get use to the touchiness of it. But you say you hate them all now. I want to try one badly..I want a all balls to the wall mode and a wobble pop mode too..this is so great..

So reciever only is $29.  And you could have different receivers in different board, to swap boards merely re-pair the remote to whichever board suits your whims.

I purchased the Hoyt remote for the Lacroix. Is it just plug and play?

You install the receiver the way you would any RX.  Power up the board, power on the remote, then hit 3 of the 4 buttons on the front, not the trim button.  It will vibrate and blink white lights when it binds.  Probably the easiest binding I've ever done.

I mean you do have to set min and max.  Make sure you do it in the third, fastest mode when you do that.

Also, set the control type to "off" while you do that so you motors don't spin, then turn it back on after you have the values set.

No, it's not as simple as plug and play.  You have to swap your receiver. Pair the remote to the receiver.  Plug in your master VESC to the computer and reprogram the input's Min/Max points with a BLDC tool that supports the firmware that La Croix is using.

I've noticed the brakes acting far better better than acceleration in terms of slop with dead zone at the default 15%.  I might have to play with the positive ramp up time as well like @DAddYE  since it's defaulted to .3
