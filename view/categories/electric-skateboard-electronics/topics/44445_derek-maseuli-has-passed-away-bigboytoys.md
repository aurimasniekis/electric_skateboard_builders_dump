This is Derek Maseuli's(bigboytoys) Mom. He has passed away. Thank you for your friendship and cameraderie with my son. Innovating and creating were two of his passions. Please contact  His close friends for details of his funerral. There are some very mean spirited women posting morbid lies and trying to disrespect him. So the details cannot be posted publicly in the forum but Dereks FRIENDS are welcome to attend.
Thank You,
Dereks MOM

Mrs. Maseuli, thank you for taking the time and courage to contact the community. Derek was and always will be a revered part of the Esk8 community. His passion drive and enthusiasm he had for the sport was second to none. He was a great competitor, talent and friend. ![IMG_20180102_165728|489x500](upload://hmmUDfnywxoRwHgAIe0JvuHJ1xo.jpg)

Thank you for sharing with us on the forum. 

I'm sure I'm speaking for many of us when I say we're deeply sorry for your loss. 

He will be missed by this community, which he was an important part of. I never knew him in person, but from what I saw on this forum he was a great person spreading and sharing ideas, always willing to help others. We were shocked and saddened by the news of his accident.

Our prayers are with you and your family. :heart:

@BigBoyToys

I am deeply sorry for your loss, Derek will be missed dearly.

I am also sorry about the fake person spreading false news. I am partially to blame for not verifying their identity. 

We started collecting some money for Derek when we first heard he was in an accident. Do we have your consent to continue the fundraiser? One of us close to Derek will handle the funds and will ensure they get to you.

All my prayers with you Mrs Maseuli and with your family. As a community initiative (and with no objective to override any upcoming initiative), we have started to collect a money pot. If we have your approval/consent, we can continue the fundraiser or transfer the ownership to you so you can follow up on our initiative. I will proceed accordingly to your direction.

I'm sorry for your loss, he be missed and remembered around here.

I'm pretty new here. I checked my Activity page, and a majority of my replies and likes were directed to @bigboytoys. He has been extremely generous with his time and knowledge to total strangers including me. He's even noticed my reply on a hub wheel for sale thread, and PMed me unsolicited and much appreciated advice. He's been a big influence on how I think about this hobby. He will be missed.

Over a hundred miles of riding and i always looked forward to the next ride. Enjoyed your positivity and general joy of life. Was looking forward to getting into ebikes and RC boats with you or any new hobby really. You got me like no one got me from one builder to another. R.I.P. Derek Maseuli I'll miss you bro

After seeing Derek in that great video footage racing down in L.A., where he came flying off the board in his t-shirt and then jumped back on and did the race moments later, I cant get it out of my mind wondering how something so extreme as death could happen to such a burly guy.   I hope I'm not upsetting anyone by asking what happened!?  was he not wearing his helmet or hit by a car?  I cant believe he just fell off.  People do that all the time.  I know if he were here he would be a great help as always and tell us what happened and what we should be cautious of.

With all the due respect, I would like to share a message from Drew and Chanel with all of you.

> I want to thank all of you guys for the generous share a gift I have received on behalf of my brother. Also for the love and support that you guys have shown Derek this whole time before and after his passing. You guys are an amazing group of friends and individuals. Derek was truly able to connect  with a lot of you guys on a different level and all of you guys have become family.   So much so that he pulled me in to the E skate forums not wanting me to miss out on all the fun. I soon got to experience the  full connection and passion  that Derek shared with all of you for the love of E -skate board building, riding, etc. that we all share and the amazing people connected to the sport.  Derek always knew the power of education, knowledge and communication. He thought it would be a good idea for me to be up-to-date on the ESkate forums tech talk and wanted me to catch up on all his posts and comments. I would soon find out that I was about 2000 posts read, 900 comments and  1 year late at least it felt like it with how deep the thread conversations were getting. I would eventually find out how  seriously involved Derek would get in to the sport 2 years later when he built his 10th fully custom DIY board. And also broke and holds multiple records including but not limited to 
> First person to complete 100 miles on a single charge, Fastest 100 meter 4 Wheel Drive top speed, Fastest 50 meter acceleration, Fastest 4 wheel drive lap time and I'm sure I'm forgetting a couple more. 
> Derek loved to build things his whole life and was very good at it as well. The E-skate forums were the holy mecca of technical information  and do it yourself custom builds. He fell in love and never stopped building. I want to personally thank everyone for the love and support you guys have shown me and my family during this hard time.
