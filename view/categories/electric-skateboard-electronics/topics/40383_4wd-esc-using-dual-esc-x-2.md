This configuration is some difficult to install.
I made two changes.
The first, 6 wire connector work.

Looks like he connected the rf pins from one board to the other one so it sends the signal to both escs

This Dual ESC is customized for 4WD.
I requested from dickyho.
Maybe, Sub ESC is assumed to be slightly customized.
Main ESC and Sub ESC connection is pin to pin.

Dual ESC can support reverse. 
Remote controller have reverse button.
But I didn't check reverse in the 4WD ESC yet.
After checking this, i will let you know.

Hello i've diffrent type of esc , i noticed a connector / terminals in the middle of the circuit .. How can i know if i can use them to connect two conntrollers together ..? The seller tried to ask the supplier but he returned without an answer. 

Did someone already made 4WD board using this type of esc ?

I bought this exact 4WD ESC pair from ebay. The brakes are almost dangerously strong. Has anyone found a way to make them smoother? Maybe know a way to disable the brakes on only one of the ESC's?
