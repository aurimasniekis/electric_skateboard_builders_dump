So about to put the final wire into the BMS and see/pray if this works 😂. 

Ok so balance wire voltages spot on. Have wired the negative from the battery to the BMS B-. Wired the charge port negative to the P-, with a negative wire that will connect to the antispark. It’s ok to put the charge and negative wires to antispark into the same BMS P-?

That’s exactly how i wired mine too. Unless you want to bypass the discharge your wiring is ok but I would double triple check balance connector voltages.
