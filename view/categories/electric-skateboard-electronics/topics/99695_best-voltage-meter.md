I have the 1st listed above unfortunately its percentage readouts are useless for my 30q pack. They are fairly accurate to start with, but become increasing inaccurate the more i discharge(Reporting ive much less range than i actually have). So now I use the discharge curves from the samsung specsheet and lygte-info.dk, to enter my own voltages/percentages into an app for accurate readings. I charge with a balance charger, so i know this method is accurate. 

I stop riding for a few minutes to get an accurate reading too. If anyone knows of one you can calibrate discharge curves yourself please let me know.
