```
id like to apologize first since im about 99% sure this is a thread topic already, i just need a point-blank, explicit answer on this one

I just read xt90s are rated for 90 amps. Im using and enertion unity set to 65 amps per motor. But the unity comes with an xt60 stock?? Should i be upgrading this? And if so whats the best connector I should be using? 

Is yes ill be upgrading all around to 10 awg wire and xt90s or whatever can handle more current easily.
