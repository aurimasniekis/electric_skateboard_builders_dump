I want to build a esk8 with 2x 5S LiPos and want easy charging.

Would this work?

Simple answer: No - you can not charge two batteries in parallel while they are hooked up in series.

And if I put a high current 3 pole switch in there, to switch between charging and discharging?

I don't know if any 3 pole switches that can handle that voltage. 

Also what happenes when you forget and put the switch on the wrong setting while charging? Boom

That's a point. Now it really seems like a stupid idea.
