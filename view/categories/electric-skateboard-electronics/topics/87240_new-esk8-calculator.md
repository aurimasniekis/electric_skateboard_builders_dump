I put up a new calculator similar to the old one everyone loved.  The one that disappeared...

Enjoy!  Let me know if you have any comments, concerns, or suggestions for improvements.

Hey @b264

I'm making brand new calculators.
I'm using a newer technique so the calculator is a progressive web app instead of website.

Maybe we could team up?

Even got my visistors some discount at Nkon.

@SynteX This is built with Angular 7.  It appears you're using Ionic?

I have a bunch more tabs on there that aren't visible yet because they're not completely finished.

I did see yours before I made this.  From the looks of it, yours is approaching a different need -- making batteries -- where this one is approaching making boards from batteries.  Both are equally as important and can compliment each other well.  I have a spreadsheet I could share with you that I've used while selecting cells if you want, PM me

If this approach would solve a problem, I'd gladly use it, but I don't need any of that, as I'm not storing information or transmitting anything to any backend server.  In fact, there isn't even a server; it's serverless and served by the Github CDN.

Thanks for the fast response.

I'm going to add more calculators to the website. I just wanted to create a "umbrella" of diffrent calculators (Thats why I bought this domain).

Mine is made in React.JS.

Didn't know yours was made in angular nice callculator!

When I tried using ReactJS it seemed really shitty and low-quality so I just kept using Ionic.  But in this case, I don't think any of that is needed.

Your C-Ratings are off.

Because they exist, in a _calculator_.
