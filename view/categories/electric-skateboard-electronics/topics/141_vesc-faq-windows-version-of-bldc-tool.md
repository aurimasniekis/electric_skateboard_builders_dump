This is excellent news @onloop ! It even makes it possible to upgrade\flash the firmware using the Windows tool (assuming that feature works in this implementation). This should open up VESC as an option for many more folks.

Hmmm only the Linux 2.4 is done? 2.3 had a lot of bugs and was scrapped i thought jacob said.

It's not done. It say's 2.4, but it's not. When you download it you'll end up with 2.3. 

Gotta say, I'm pretty stoked right now that I waited 4 weeks for something with a 2 week lead time only to find out that I cant do anything with them. 

Not to say that Chaka isn't great with customer service. He is. The VESCS look great! (on my bookshelf)

Thanks for being patient @psychotiller, I hope it was worth the wait. 

 We are finally hitting our stride and keeping up with production inventory so I do not expect anymore delays. If everything goes well we will be able to ship same day in a few weeks but word is getting out about the zero failure rate on my builds so that may not last long. 

I also want to give a big thank you to all our customers. You have helped our little boardshop expand into electronics manufacturing and we will soon be making every bit of electronics needed to build an eboard with the same quality and reliability as our VESC builds.

I tried this one originally and it said it was for windows 2.4 but turned out to be 2.3. No virus though. Chaka ended up linking me to an ubuntu download and I installed it next to windows on my laptop. Once it learned how to dumb itself down to my level, it wiped the drool from my chin and set up my Vesc's.

What is he having trouble with, I run it on Windows 10 for testing before I upload each update.

Mostly the problems are drivers but it he can't open the Exe file I'm note sure but I'll looki to it.

Recently i have setup a website for the use of downloading of BLDC-TOOL for windows and OS X and all VESC related Firmware and files, this link will soon be a fully set up website with active download links, support documents and videos as well as offering vesc support via remote access and video call.
the new link for BLDC-TOOL updates is:

http://www.vesc.support  or
http://www.bldc-tool.support

if any one has the knowledge and wants to help me set this website up that would be great i will pay maybe in vesc!

also BLDC TOOL 2.10 is know available

check my latest updated windows version of bldc tool.

http://vesc.support

iv actually been working on the installer so know it places all files for you, instal's the correct drivers and then places a desktop icon,
if you plug in your vesc before loading bldc tool then bldc tool automatically detects the vesc and sets the correct com port while tagging that com port (vesc) so the user knows its detected. you simply just click connect. soon ill add auto connect.
there is also a refresh button that locates the vesc just incase you didn't plug it in before opening.

this is all apart of trying to reduce confusion.

I'm about 2 weeks away from finishing a bldc tool esc setup wizard that will have a single button to detect foc and bldc settings and app data to make it easy for customers with no knowledge.

please every body i need feed back on my site.

OK.  Really frustrated here.  I have looked, but can't find ANY info anywhere regarding the proper connection settings when using USB.  I would think there would be some easily available information on how to get started (i.e. connected to your VESC), but it is eluding me.  :frowning: 

I have downloaded & installed the Widows version of the BLDC tool, connected the right-side VESC in my Raptor board (the that looks to be the "master" based on the remote receiver board being connected to it) using a min-USB cable, turned on the battery (I also tried it without the battery turned on), and ran the BLDC tool.

I get 2 pre-set connection options in the upper right (COM3 and 192.168.1.118) corner of the BLDC tool software, both which do not work.  The VESC does not seem to be recognized as a USB device at all.

If someone could provide me with some help, I'd appreciate it.

make sure you have the stm32 drivers installed. http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF257938 or https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html it's the same driver as the teensy uses

It should appear in your device manager as a serial com port, enter the correct com port in the bldc tool.

(for the device manager, in the search file and program type devmgmt.msc)

Thanks Blasto.  It doesn't appear to be working.  I installed the STM32 driver, but nothing new shows up in Device Manager, and BLDC still does not work.  One thing I noticed is that the STM32 drivers seem to be built for Windows 7 or 8, and I am running Windows 10.  Do you know if that's an issue?  Most Windows 8 drivers work fine on Windows 10...

never used windows 10, but i don't see any reason why the driver shouldn't work. if you do not see another COM port, the driver is definitely your problem.

oh and you need to power up the vesc.

Thank you for your assistance on this.  Unfortunately, I have not had any luck getting the COM port to show up in Device Manager.  Given what you've told me, I assume this is the issue.

I don't know if it's Windows 10 or not.  I don't get any error messages at any point.  I downloaded the installer in the link above, and the installation completed without error.  I followed the instructions in the readme, navigated to the C:\Program Files (x86)\STMicroelectronics\Software\Virtual comport driver folder and double clicked dpinst_amd64.exe.  That installation also completed without error.  Then I powered on my battery (I see blue lights on both VESCs), plugged in my USB cable to the master VESC (or the one I assume is the master), and tried multiple USB ports on my computer.  I got nothing.  Not even the sound normally heard when a USB device is connected.

Since I'm not getting any errors, I'm really not sure where to go.  I'm not a computer noob, but I haven't had to deal with something so seemingly archaic since the early days of Android rooting.  It's probably my lack of knowledge about the VESC and it's communication protocols.  Any help would be appreciated.

Also, just FYI, sometimes Windows will try to install a newer driver for the OS than will work with specific hardware. 

If your board is running, as on and working and your plugged into the VESC via USB I'd think it should show up in device manager somewhere. It may not be under com ports, could be unkown or something. If it doesn't show at all, even without any driver installed, there may be another issue. 

You have a dual right? I had to order an adapter to fit in the tight space between the glued in VESC and the side of the electronics compartment on my dual Raptor. None of my exsisting connections would work. Did you have an adapter or cable that worked without issue? Are you 100%sure that the cable and/or adapter your using supports data, and not just charging? There are plenty of Mini USB cables and adaptors that aren't made for data transfer, at all.  Is there any chance you've damaged the USB port connection on the VESC, or that it wasn't intacted when you received it? Does a visual inspection of the USB port on the VESC seem OK, no bad solder joints etc? 

You probably thought of all this yourself, but I thought I'd ask just in case something basic slipped your mind. Sometimes we can't help thinking zebras ...

OK.  Got connected.  Turned out to be a bad USB cable (or perhaps one that is only for charging).  NOW I have a new problem:  Firmware incompatibility.  <sigh>  Anyone know where I can get the Proper version of the BLDC tool for VESC firmware 1.14?
