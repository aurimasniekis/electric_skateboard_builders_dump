as im finishing up my 12s 149kv build, i've been increasingly more and more interested in using FOC mode instead of BLDC since its supposedly way smoother,  However, i've heard switching to it can fry your VESC.  How do i switch safely? where can i get the firmware to flash it (?) and how do i do that? 
Cheers!

You should have a look at YouTube for "Benjamin Vedder FOC". There he explains how to setup FOC. Or you use my firmware mod which has additional tool tips for the parameters that explain you what needs to be done.
