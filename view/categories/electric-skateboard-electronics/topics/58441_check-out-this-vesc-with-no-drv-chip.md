Clicked onto this while I was browsing the VESC project forum.

I’ll probs buy one for an electric scooter project I have in mind.

Notes:
* Still programmable by the VESC tool.
* Doesn’t have a temp sensor.
* Makes use of a separate power board, so the electric engineers of the crowd can probably redesign the power board to accommodate beefier FETs 
* Unused CPU pins breakout to a testpad.
