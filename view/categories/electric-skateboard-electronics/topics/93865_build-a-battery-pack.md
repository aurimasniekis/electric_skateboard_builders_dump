Hey guys I have a little question.

I want to build a 12s6p battery pack with the vtc5a. 

I want to make 6s packs. So 36cells each pack.
Can I arrange 9x4 cells to get them 6s? Iam a little bit stupid atm if thats even possible. So that I can fit them in my bag.

Yes it is possible, but welding a pack that shape is not going to be fun.

Yah you'd be doing a row and a half to get 6 cells together in a P group so would be a bit of tetris battery.  Also if putting in a bag far from the ESC think you may need extra caps at the ESC end to compensate for the long battery wires.

Ok that was fast thanks guys, @taz nice drawing thanks. So I just need to find out how to connect the nickel stripes for the series connections. Will it be that terrible to weld it or is it okay? Its my first 18650 pack everything is here I wanted to make it more easy for the first one but I have to fit them in the bag. I love that bag :D

Don't have any experience spot welding these so take this with a grain of salt but think you can just leave the tabs extending a bit out the edge of the rows that you need to connect and then use another vertical tab to connect the rows (so want 6 + together up top would leave tabs hanging off left then connect them).  Only thing to be cautious of there is wrapping things in fish tape or otherwise insulating the tabs hanging off from touching the sides of the cells (also making them short as possible to avoid touching other things).  Sure once you have the thing laid out can post to the check out my battery so I don't start a fire thread to get a lot more feedback.

Ok guys @Andy87 helped me a bit. You are the best man.

Anyways here is how I would do it to get a 6s Pack in the shape of 9x4 cells. Maybe someone can take a look I really appreciate every help! 

Thanks so much!

Both look good to me, only reason I suggested doing the nickel strips on the outside is to avoid needing to weld through two strips of nickel to get to the cell (or needing to weld more spots on top of the cells), but if you went that route need to be very careful about tabs not moving around or touching things so maybe this way will be better despite needing to weld through multiple strips.  Other plus side here is more vertical paths for current to flow overall looks good to me.

I think @seaborder didn´t give all information.

He´s going to use the plastic spacer/cell holder to hold the cells in place as well as H formed nickel strips.

With this layout there will be max 2 layers of nickel over each other. I don´t understand why the second layer should be welded to the cell as well @wafflejock . 

First layer is nickel to the cell terminal, second layer is nickel to nickel, not nickel through nickel to cell terminal.
