I want to extant the sensor wires of my APS motors.
As far as I know it doesn´t matter in which order the sensor wires plugged as long as the +5V and the ground on the right position.
Unfortunately the wire color order from the APS motors, don´t fit to all pictures I found here.
That´s why I wanted to double check if I´m right when I assume that in my case 
Black is ground
Red is +5V

which would mean that for the focbox I need to turn the plug 180* from the picture below.

Would be nice if somebody could double check it and let me know if I´m on the right way.
Maybe there is an easy way to measure it out with a Fluke?
