Hi there,

I just went to ride my electric longbaord and eventually the battery was empty. I wanted to charge it but then it said battery low voltage. I looked up how to fix it. I switched my charger to NiMH and charged it to 10v then i changed the setting to Li-Po and saw that my cells in my 3s battery's are uneven. 1 cell has 0v 2nd cell has 1.28v and the 3rd cell has 5.00v. After 5 seconds the charger says battery voll err cell connect. Does anybody know what this means?
I have a Imax B6 btw.
Thank you for looking

One of your battery cells are probably destroyed or dead, or a wire come loose from cell 1.

If the cell 1 had much lower capacity then your other cells it is probably dead and destroyed because that cell will be empty first and when it is empty and the other isnt it will keep drawing current through it and destroy it more.

And what are your battery specs?
5S? 3S?

If a cell is really at 5v you need to put the battery in a lipo safe bag and safely dispose of it ASAP

He needs new battery then, if not a wire come loose and is touching the 3rd cell and "adding" the voltage for it, but that is not very likely to happen.

i have hat the bought these batteries about one month ago and i never really used them. So i just think it's weird that this happens. Do you have any suggestions for new batteries?

did you charge them before you used them?

No i didn't charge them before i used them. I changed the connections tho. I changed them from 5.5 bullet connectors to xt90 connectors.

How do you charge them? one by one?

do you have a multimeter to confirm the voltage.  5v is super high and scary.  and you just got those.   weird

Is your battery bulky? like it has a little bubble in the middle?

you could try to push the wires to the left for this pictures so it goes up:

So if it has "fallen out" you could try to push it up again?

multimeter?  check the voltage to make sure.  5v you should put somewhere safe as was said.  the 0v one is gone if it's true.  and likely the 5v too.  did it get warm?
and you'd charged the pack of three together?  not balance charge with the balance leads attached?

yea it seems you're getting voltages from two cells combined and one of the cells isn't showing up by itself.  check the balance wires voltages, add them up, and compare to the complete pack voltage

The batteries never got warm. I have been keeping them in a lipo safe bag. I have never tried charging all the batteries at the same time only one at a time. Whenever i would charge my batterie I always put in the balance lead

and your charger is telling you "fault" or something and you can't get the individual cell voltages?  the pack voltage?  you can get a multimeter for 10$ and answer a lot.  I"ve had chargers that won't tell the voltages if they're too far from what they should be

If he checks with multimeter the first wire should be around 2.5 -> 4.2V the second 5 -> 8.4V, and the third wire  7.5 -> 12.6V.

but there are 4 wires form the balance lead and 2 wires from the multimeter. How could i check the volts on that?

your pack is 3 cells and each one has two wires come out, but they overlap, so 4 balance wires.  just go from cell to cell, each close wire on the balance plug

You measure the cells one at a time. One probe goes in the - or + (not sure which one) discharge leads and the other goes in one of the balance leads.

there's a couple ways you could measure, with the main leads and the balance or just the balance.  you'll figure it out just stick the prongs to things. don't think you could possibly short anything unless you touch the prongs while connected to the battery

Okay so i checked the voltage on the cells and I think that I just have a cheap charger. on 2 batteries everything is fine. On the third battery 2 cells are about 3.6V and the 3rd cell is 0.78v. So i am guessing that I lost the third cell on my third battery. How do I prevent losing cells on my other batteries?

Btw Thank You all so much for all the help. I couldn't do it without you guys!!
Thank you

that's weird especially since theyre so new.  I've killed cells similarly when I have one cell that's lower than the rest and then while riding it falls off the voltage cliff while the others are still keeping the pack above the low voltage cut off on the vesc
