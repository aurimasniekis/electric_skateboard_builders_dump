Hello, hope that anyone has ideas :)  
Suddenly my Motor wouldn't react to any signals, neither the remote nor when connected to the BLDC-tool. 
It didn't read any errors except for when i turn the wheel and generate more than 4 A of power. Then the Red LED would blink three times and the terminal would give the dreaded FAULT_CODE_DRV error. 
Is it definite that the DRV chip is blown?

Any help is welcome.
