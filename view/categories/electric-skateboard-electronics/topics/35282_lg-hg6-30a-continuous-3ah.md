got an email about these becoming [available today](https://www.imrbatteries.com/lg-hg6-20650-3000mah-30a-battery/).

LG HG6 20650 3Ah

can't find any datasheets and batterybros haven't done a write up on yet but looks promising.

also real freggin expensive still but potentially these cells could be in a 2P setup.  capacity is not very impressive but this may work for light weight builds.

I wonder why they went with 20650 instead of 21700 like the 30t's.

Yeah I heard LG had a couple 20650 models on the way. I'm holding off till next year to get 20650 or 20700 or 21700 or some other size one becomes standard and the price starts dropping.

Yep, if they deliver as promised and 30A continuous under 80 degrees C, it could become a seriois alternative to unavailable Samsung 30T.

650 length allows to keep packs shorter too. That's interesting!

In short. "rating this cell at 30A and 2800mAh." Samsung 30T are the best cells to have whenever Samsung decides to release them.

They are bigger heavier and not much better than 30q why would you choose them except the overkill 30a

I need to drop as much weight off my deck so the 12S2P configuration works best with either the HG6 or 30T. My current 10S5P 25R pack is too much.

yup, my 12s4p dual 6374 gets used WAY LESS than my 12s3p mono. 

lighter is better, unless it's larger distances to cover.
