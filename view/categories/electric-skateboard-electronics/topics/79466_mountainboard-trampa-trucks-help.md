Hey again. 

In my first ever Post i was looking for a alternative to the DIYeboard Offroad truck kit.

Alot of people said , Trampa,Trampa,Trampa! The Trampa site intimidates me a bit to be honest.

Is there a full set which includes, wheels,pulleys,motor Mounts, trucks etc? OR does somebody have a alternative?

Budget would be 450â‚¬/$

I use dual 6374 Motors.

I was in your shoes friend. Trampas site is indeed cluttered, scary, and unappealing. For simplicity I would suggest looking at @Idea's page [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motor-mounts-kits-for-trampa-atb-and-mbs-matrix-old-type-matrix-ii-ats/44749) and matching one of his motor mount kits to whatever trucks you like. He does a great job of selling a whole kit and including photos of what you get. Good luck!

He doesnâ€™t have a shop but this thread

Look through all of it, he has some new versions.
If you found something you like just write him a pm and give him some days to answer ðŸ˜‰

Agreed. Unfortunately his cnc controller broke as he was finishing my mount so it's on hold for now. Hopefully it gets fixed soon!
