Hey guys, 

Could anyone please tell me if this ESC would be good or if anyone has used something similar? I'm thinking of going with a single 5065 260Kv motor and a 6s limo battery.

And has anyone used this BMS with an integrated switch from Alien's?

The ESC is made for planes...that means that it will probably brake when you leave the trigger of the remote in "neutral"
