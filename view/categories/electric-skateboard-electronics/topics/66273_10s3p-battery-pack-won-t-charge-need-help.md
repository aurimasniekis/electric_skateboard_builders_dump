My battery pack has been acting very strange. When I try to charge it, it will only charge to 79% and no more. Once it gets to 79% it just jumps around percentages. Does anyone know how to fix this?

Either your BMS is bad, charger is bad, balance wire(s) broken/burnt or you've got some dead cells.  I don't think it could be anything else, start isolating and see which it is.
