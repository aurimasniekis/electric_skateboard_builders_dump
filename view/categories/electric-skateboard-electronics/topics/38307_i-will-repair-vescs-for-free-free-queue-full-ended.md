Hello all, I promise this isn't click bait. I've been a board level technician for iPhone's, Samsung devices, and Macbooks for about two years now. After looking at the schematics for the VESC it looks a whole lot simpler than what I normally work on. I'm considering getting into repairing these boards, but I would like to make sure I have a solid understanding and happy customers before I start asking for money. That being said, I will be offering several free repairs on VESCs over the next couple of weeks. How it will work, so I'm not losing money in the process is you will pay for shipping both ways and whatever parts are required for the repair will be paid for by you as well, so basically you won't be charged for any labor. If you're interested just reply below and I will PM you. I am located in Florida. 

Here are a few pictures of my equipment and a backlight repair on an iPhone 6 Plus<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/2/62326cb7ad7613f0dbda849e478aeec5527e4444.jpg" width="668" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/a/9a9ba651fd64db2cdb9aa8d6a03a93fe55abcb7c.jpg" width="668" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/f/bf51c655f5278813099a592dd04fb2c8c61a4959.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Sounds like @longhairedboy has found a partner for electric repair. IDK if you know him already, he probably has a bunch you can work on.

Thanks for the kind contribution. I will ride my board hard ASAP. I just blew the same FocBox a second time (repaired once) running FOC, it was either a faulty vesc or something with the motor as I have exact same settings in both using split ppm

This one is an AmScope SM-4TZ-144A I believe.  The LED ring came with the scope, but you can probably find one on amazon. The AmScope ones seem pretty universal.

Yeah MSRP would put it all at about that amount, but you can do some negotiating with them. They let you demo it for a month, so if you decline the sale they are left with used gear. That makes it a bit easier to get the price down.

1 hour 36 minutes according to google maps. Depending on what's going on, driving may be more convenient than using the postal service. I'm in the Orlando area.

As a general message to everyone who PM'd me or is considering it, I can't reasonably have you all ship at the same time and make you wait weeks for me to get around to it.  I'm currently a full time student and will be doing this in my spare time.  If you urgently need your VESC back, this is not the service for you.

i think there's enough demand that you could charge a nominal fee just to make it worth it.

either way, super awesome you're offering up your services.

[/quote]

Create a shared Google Doc, Enter each VESC's received date and user name with a date. First in first out system. everyone checks the log prior to making a decision of sending you a VESC. Have a cap of 25 so there will never be more than 25 on your to-do list, once a space opens up you can accept another VESC with a rough estimate of return time

One important thing to note too, the amazing DRVWizard resides across the border in Montreal, and shipping takes ages. Offering a service within the US would be awesome.

Just paid the wizard 45 bucks to fix it, plus the shopping from me to him, for reference :slight_smile:

Thank you to everyone who messaged me. I've received a ton of requests and I plan on trying to fulfill all of them. I will no longer be taking any more free VESC repairs. Once I complete my current queue I will most likely begin offering a paid service once I decide on a fair price and everything. Of the requests that I have received, I will be adding your username to a Google Doc and will fix all VESCs in the order they are received. Be aware I do not have many replacement components on hand and will likely have to order parts and wait for shipping, so repairs can take several weeks. I will do my best to keep the Doc up to date so you can reference that and know when you will get your VESC back. 

On a side note, I will be leaving my current job that grants me access to the awesome JBC equipment. In order to continue offering the paid version of this service, I plan on purchasing my own equipment. If anyone would like to contribute to that, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks again!

If you want a few free ones let me know, got some old enertion ones that crapped out their DRV chips. I may even have a spare DRV chip that I never opened since I got a Chaka vesc and it never failed me afterwards.

Hello. I see you aren't doing free repairs anymore and that you live in Florida.(?) I live in Texas. If i send you the Vesc via usps and if i paid you to repair it (which will hopefully be less expensive than a replacement), will you be able to do it? 
Here are some images. I imagine there is more damage that you cant see. Anything you can do would be great. The only other person that does this stuff is in Germany lol... Please and thank you.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/a/caeb7beec802ad86a1000bbcbe6d9efdfd85ae58.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Thermal, i just bricked my VESC 6 by wiring the UART reciever to the VESC 6 wrongly, would you know how to fix this if so could you circle the parts on the board that would need replacing, here is s picture of the VESC 6

@Volts hey sorry for the late reply. Iâ€™ve been studying nonstop for a Physics 3 exam I just took today. 

If I recall, the UART can utilize both the 5v and 3.3v inputs. Depending on how you had it wired itâ€™s possible you shorted one, or both of those rails. Generally if you plug a Bluetooth module or a receiver into the VESC and if it powers up that means your 5v rail is working. The 3.3v rail is powered by the 5v rail. If the 3.3v rail is the issue, you may have blown the MCU or another component on the 3.3v rail. 

Do you have a multimeter and any experience testing powered systems? There are several tests you can perform without powering the VESC as well that should help us narrow down the cause of the problem. 

Also, unless the issue with the VESC was caused by a short of VBatt, the main power input, there most likely will not be any visible damage on the VESC. Iâ€™ll do my best to help you diagnose whatâ€™s going on though.
```
