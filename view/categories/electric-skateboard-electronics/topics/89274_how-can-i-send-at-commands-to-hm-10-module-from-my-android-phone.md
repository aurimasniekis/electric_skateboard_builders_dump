Earlier today, I was able to connect flawlessly to my HM-10 module via the Arduino serial monitor. I think I then changed some settings without thinking and now I can no longer connect to it. No errors, nothing. I have tried every baud setting but to no avail. I am able to connect to it through my Android phone but is there an app where I can send AT commands just like the Arduino serial monitor. I'm thinking I could do this to run the at+reset command to factory reset it? Are there any other ways of resetting the module?
