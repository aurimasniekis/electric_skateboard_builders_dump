I'm putting together my 10s3p battery and the question arose:

How to calculate the maximum continuous discharge current to choose my BMS?

How to know if you should choose 35A or 60A or 100A etc ...

From reading things on this forum I don't think you need a discharge BMS. A charge and discharge BMS are much larger than a charge only BMS as well. A charge only BMS should be fine since the batteries don't drift far apart if I am not wrong and if you use the battery safely and have a good cutoff, then the batteries won't be damaged from over discharging them.

If you have a 10s3p 30q pack. You can pull 60a max. Therefore your bms should be 60a or higher


No offence, but there is a noob questions thread that is perfect for stuff like this. It would also get you alot more views and exposure.

How do you calculate that with 10s3p you shoot 60A maximum?
