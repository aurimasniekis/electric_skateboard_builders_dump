So here it is.What ESC would you recommend, price within reason.

- ZIPPY Flightmax 8000mAh 4S1P 30C (x2 to make an 8s 8000mAh battery)

- Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-245kv

I am really looking to learn more and would appreciate your advice. 

Thanks!

For sure VESC! I road a car esc for 2 years. Just upgrade to vesc and it's day and night difference! I bought the maytech vesc on ebay for 90$. My car esc cost 120$. Easy choice.

Question: Whats the most reliable ESC for any build?
Answer: Vesc

Question: What the best performing ESC for any build?
Answer: Vesc

Performance: The Vesc is not only smoother on acceleration and braking.
I it also more efficient. 
When I upgraded from my 120a car esc's to Vesc I think I gained about 5 mph on top end.
