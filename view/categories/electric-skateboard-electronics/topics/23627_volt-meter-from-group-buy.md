Hi! 
Those who have volt meter from @ajaynagra group buy, how do use it ? I mean it shows 0% all the time, when I press button on the back it shows volts. O.k volts are correct, but when I switch off battery, next time when I turn battery on it resets to % again. I need it to stay on volt reading all the time I don't care about % reading.

On the back is button, but there is also another button( same but,there some parts missing) picture:

Maybe that other button is for programming? Because that first button is only change % to volts and turn off device.

You hold in the programming button when turning it on and it goes into a different mode. Then from there youll have to mess around with it as I havnt had the time to get it to onyl show volts.
