Depends on your voltage mostly. But APS quality is definitely higher) I would suggest APS 200kv with 10s battery

EDIT: I just realized you want to get FOCBOX's from me so 10s for sure!!! At 10s you can choose either motor. You won't feel to much of a difference, but the HEV will in any case be a little better but that's also why it's a little more expensive!

The 192 kv would be safer at 12s without worrying about the erpm of an old vesc, they are so close of kv that it doesn't matter that much, a bigger deal would be if one was sensored

You can use a 12s battery, the FOCBOX is capable! it's if you want to run in FOC 10s is recommend) it's basically the sweet middle between V and A
