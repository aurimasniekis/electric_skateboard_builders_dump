need your help here guys. I am using a MEB Remote and until now I have never had a single problem with this remote. I disconnected the receiver to install a servo splitter and now I can't get it to respond at all. One 5v wire has been removed from the splitter so that's not a problem. I cannot get the receiver LED to illuminate.
However, the receiver circuit board is warm to the touch.

No led light but the circled area gets warm to the touch when plugged up.
