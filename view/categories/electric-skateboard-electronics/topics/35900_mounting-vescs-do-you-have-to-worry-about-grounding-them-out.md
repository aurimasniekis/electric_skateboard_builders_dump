Hello,

I was wondering how others mount their vescs?  The mounting holes seem really close to some of the components and im worried using a screw and a standoff it could possibly ground out.  For my current board I am using plastic standoffs and plastic screws and it works just not as solid as I wanted.

I've never worried about that, just make sure everything is secured and not wiggling around

I'm using double sided mounting tape ðŸ˜‚
generic white foam stuff.

Its much easier to make a enclosure for it that is a tight fit where you could just tape/glue the part into the enclosure instead of screwing the parts in.  then if you wanted you could screw the enclosure down.
