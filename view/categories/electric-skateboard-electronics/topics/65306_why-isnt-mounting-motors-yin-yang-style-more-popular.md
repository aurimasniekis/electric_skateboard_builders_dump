# Why isn&rsquo;t mounting motors yin-yang style more popular?

The vast majority of dual 6374 motor setups that I see are dual rear with both motors either mounted under the board or behind the board. This requires extra wide trucks which negatively impact handling and turning radius. Diagonal drive allows you to have narrower trucks, but another option that I have only seen on one build is yin-yang motor mounts on the rear wheels. I don't understand why this setup isn't more popular...you can have two 6374 motors powering the rear wheels and use better handling narrower trucks.

I wonder this too. Perhaps the truck can't handle the torsion from both sides?I would hope it could stand up to something like that or I'd rather not ride on it.

I don't think there's anything wrong with this but that back motor is gonna hit the king pin when you carve hard. Reverse mountes are longer to prevent this. Another issue is looks humans like symmetry.

That looks very close to the kingpin

I think it'd be sweet to get some narrow hangar width truck and mount dual 6384s like this. Someone has to have done it, anyone have pics? This would be esk8 porn for sure.

Looks assymetric, that's why nobody use it

Donâ€™t like becuase it looks odd. I literately ended up with dual motors becuase I didnâ€™t like the look of my single 6374 first build. It was plenty fast and torquey for my needs.

Technically you would need different long motor mounts that you donâ€™t hit the KP but also donâ€™t hit the deck ..... and it doesnâ€™t look great. Better one on the front and the other on the back truck

Slightly off topic
What's wrong with the way ollin does it?

Diagonal drive is a great option as well. However I know that a lot of people prefer rwd boards.

I'd say it has more to do with the aesthetics.

Dual diag has traction issues during certain manuevers and requires odd esc placement so most people tend to keep the motors on one side.

What really surprises me is the lack of coaxial belt drives using 1 motor between 2 mounts. It would way to bring the cost of these devices down a little. The only disadvantage in my mind is no traction control, but considering lots of people run split ppm I don't see how the lack of traction control would be worth the cost savings.

Yes I have and if there is sand it wet leaves or anything that can make you loose traction you will loose traction lol.

Same, dual billet ronins with dual 6384 yin yang style with helical gear drive is my dream build.
