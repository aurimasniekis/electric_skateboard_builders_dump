It's not a marvel of engineering.  It doesn't light-up blue.  It's not as nice as the [url=product/on-off-high-voltage-anti-spark-power-switch-2-14s/]push-button anti-spark[/url], or similar (out of stock) on [url=http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/high-amp-120A-electronic-ignition-on-off-switch/]Enertion[/url].
It's also not $45-60.

This might be a bit remedial for some of you (you know who you are), but i wanted to show how i built one in case someone else wants to make their own.  You can do it easier/simpler, but i had some time to fiddle in the garage and enjoyed making it for my next build.

Starting off with the [url=http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__61690__XT90_S_Anti_Spark_Connector_2pairs_bag_.html]anti-spark XT-90[/url]:

I took some 12/2 wire i had laying around and the copper ground wire works perfectly to bridge the contacts for the loop.

I like modular.  If it ever fails or i want to do something differently i can easily swap it out without cutting it out.
6mm connectors:
[img]/uploads/db1493/original/1X/2bb690df1c85fc2397ba878f376ea90d00eaae39.jpg[/img]
The slot is so i can squeeze it to better fit/solder.

Mocked up:
[img]/uploads/db1493/original/1X/d7e8ea012913f3940cb4cf12fcdf9afb2da51a5a.jpg[/img]

Finished with some heatshrink and paracord so i can easily pull to disconnect.

Finished:
[img]/uploads/db1493/original/1X/6cd781417fc60cc2018d6e55ad562fbcf88348f7.jpg[/img]

Only issue i can imagine is depth to fit.  I will likely turn it flat and secure the bottom down.  I might also attach a small cord/wire to the paracord loop to prevent it from getting lost.

Nothing too special, but i think it turned out well.  I plan to install on my new e-Omen (ongoing slowly).

Hope it helps!

also if you don't have the XT-90 anti spark connectors you can do the same thing by soldering a resistor across the connector.
I have done this with a Deans type.

There are tons of ways to do this - slow the inrush (which arcs and sparks).  You can add a simple momentary button and resistor like so:
[img]/uploads/db1493/original/1X/bdf73cd2e16a8e46894588e52ba905032a2490ff.jpg[/img]
You would push the button to bypass the plug momentarily while plugging in the connector fully.

Or the pre-made XT-90 anti-spark is a great all-in-one and simple option.  

On the positive connector (right side w/ green) if you look down the inside where it connects you can see there is an early contact area (also insulated from the back connector on that side) before the negative connects as well:
[img]/uploads/db1493/original/1X/b8418cb618a8c4448754f285fba27243d3aff073.jpg[/img]
It has a resistor (labeled - something like 560Î©), so it slows the inrush and suppresses the spark.  There are two "wings" or tabs on the sides which stop the plug from fully seating to allow for that inrush.  When you seat it to that stop, then push in the tabs (i usually break one off to simplify), then finally seat it fully you are done.  I've been using these inline from my batteries for a while now and really like them.  For 8-12s they work great for me!

I think XT90 just handles more amps. The XT90's are bigger as well. An XT60 should be able to handle the amount of amps an electric skateboard draws.

It's a good idea to use a loop key anyway. If that switch ever fails you will drain your batteries and could very well burn your house down.

Good to know. I definitely want to avoid burning my house down. That's where I keep my skateboards. Oh, and other stuff too.

And to follow up on the question a few posts back, what size resistor would make an XT60 work for this application?

there is no "correct" size, just something to limit the inrush current a little bit so it doesn't arc. there are many values that would work, and also depending on how many caps you have in your particular build..

@lowGuido, do you maybe have an example, or a pic of where you used this? I get the whole intermediary circuit that contains the resistor, but not sure how you would wire it so that the current flows normally (without resistance) after it's plugged in.

I'll take a photo tomorrow, but I'll try to explain now.
I take a male deans connector and solder the resistor across the terminals, 
then I short the two terminals of the female deans connector with a short loop.
hook up the batteries and then attach the loop.

here's a diagram.

Thanks for all the input. Here is a picture of my loop key I just finished. I used a 680 ohm resistor, as this was the closest I had to the one used in the actual XT90s plug (I think they use a 470, or 520 ohm one).

I finished it off with bullet connectors to close the loop. So to turn everything off, I just unplug the XT60 plug and can leave my batteries connected without issues.

```
If you look closely on the first pic (it shows on the 2nd too), you'll see I've soldered the resistor between the two terminals. So essentially, when you first plug it in with the bullet connector unplugged, the current will flow through the resistor (albeit at a much lower volume than without it). Once you plug in the bullet connector, current flows normally through the circuit, bypassing the resistor, since current takes the path with least resistance.

The other plug (male XT60) will be connected to the positive wires between batteries and VESC (as per the first post in this thread)

Right, now I see the resistor.
So it's a two-step process, first the bullet and then the loop key, right ?

Love the idea bro, I plan on building something very similar.
I have a question though, in the place where you soldered the copper cable to connect the two sides of the xt90, could I solder in a fuse instead?
Basically right now I have a large fuse online on my negative power cable before the VESC. It's 50 amps and made for a car stereo. It's just so massive and annoyingly in the way. But if I was to put a nice small fuse, like one used on vedders anti spark board, 40 amp 50v I think.  Would that work, or am I missing something in the way power travels?

@Rasmukri - that *should* work!  The main concern i would have is resistance and heat.

I'll see if i can grab one of the fuses i have and see how it might fit on the back of the XT90.  Neat idea.

As always - having a spare to swap (anti-spark or not) is good peace of mind.

I'm not sure what you are proposing will work.
a fuse and an anti spark resistor both serve different purposes.

I think you would have to put the fuse inline further down not in parallel with the resistor.

I cant see why it would be a problem. I mean its just closing the circuit, so instead of closing the circuit with a solid wire why not close the circuit with a fuse? Seems like putting it farther down the line would be no different. Power goes the easiest way possible and that will be through the fuse not the resistor, (after it has completed its job). I mean I'm no Engineer but I've been working on car and home wiring for quite some time. Resistors yes they always give me a bit of research before i do anything but i see no logical reason why a fused link would in any way not work. Think about it regardless of where the fuse is on the circuit the Same amount of amps will be passing through it.

by putting a fuse in parallel with the resistor you are changing the circuit. the fuse would still be the path of least resistance so in an over current situation it would probably still blow. but the amount of current required to blow it would change, and once its blown it would not break the circuit like a fuse is supposed to, because the resistor still completes the circuit. 
the most likely following sonario would be that the resistor would get really hot and also blow.

Hey LG - are you sure?

the way the anti-spark works it is only connected at that first few mm of plugging it in... afterwards it's out of the way and not connected - right?  or is it contacting and would then become the path (and quickly blow too)?

I'm no engineer...

if you are using an XT90-S that is the case. but not for the ones in the image above where the resistor is in parallel.

I apologise if that's what you meant originally, I was looking at the pictures directly above with the resistor in parallel.

So I just got my xt90 in the mail today.
I did a resistance test and it is 6.7 at partial insertion and 1.2 (for my voltmeter .65 is a direct contact between the two leads).
So this means the resistor is not in use once the connection is full. Meaning if I put my fuse on there it should work no problem.

Ok, I've left this way too long, but, after testing my initial loop key (with the 680 ohm resistor), I was still getting spark when connecting the bullet connectors, unless I waited long enough for the VESC capacitors to charge up (think 6-10 seconds, counting in my head every time!).

So I modified it and replaced it with a 47 ohm resistor. This way, as soon as I plug the XT60 in, the VESC lights up, then I can close the bullet connectors. PLUS, there's no spark anywhere! I'm running 9S1P if that helps anyone.

I have been doing mine this way for awhile, just never thought to post it.  

I use a piece of 10g solid copper wire, bend the ends to fit tight in the XT90-S poles and then fill with solder.  Then I cut the hald circles from the cap, super glue it in place and fill with hot glue.  After its cooled some, just a little tacky, I push it in and then smooth the edges.  It looks like this.

After that I print the XT90-S Fob cover, insert a paracord loop, melt the edges of the paracord together, fill the fob with hot glue and then insert the loop key.  Let it cool and your good to go...ease to insert, easy to remote, the Fob protects the loop key.

Is there a performance or safety difference between using copper and a 12 awg wire?
[/quote]


Not really - for such a short run it should be fine.  I would definitely go as thick as you can w/ whatever you use, and keep it as short as possible.  That was the main reason i went with the solid copper - because it was direct point to point vs a loop of wire, and strong enough to then tug on w/ the paracord.  

The only time i've heard of a problem is too thin of wire and a longer loop - more heat under load = bad.

Sorry, newbie question. The anti-spark loop key is supposed to go on the + wire, between the battery and the VESC, right ?
And it allows you to leave your battery in the board and acts like a on-off switch ?

Yes exactly! If you have a bms and charge port you should put it on the + wire in between the + of the charge port and the vesc. This way you can and should pull the key out when you are charging.

That's a good way to do it as well.  

Easier to secure the Male portion to an enclosure flush, and if the anti-spark portion of the key does get damaged (not fully seated you will melt the resistor) - a simple regular XT90 (spark!) works in a pinch and you can still ride.

One tip, after port inserted, heat up the mount for it shrink a bit to the connector, makes it impossible to push out the back even without a screw

You'd still get a big ass spark.  The only two viable options are an anti-spark switch, anti-spark loop key or BMS with E-Switch. 

This has been exhaustively covered many many time for a couple of years now.

I embedded mine in the deck. I like to use the anti-spark male shape on the deck side as its cheaper to have multiple keys that way. Just in case I loose one. With this on the side of the deck I can access it from the top or bottom in an emergency.

Just chiming in here.  With the non-resistor Female side fixed to deck - you can use any old XT-90 male w/ or w/o resistor/anti-spark in a pinch.  

I've killed a few resistors/XT-90s and do not want to cut out and re-mount into my enclosure or deck.  

Yes the "male" w/ resistor is cleaner and less able to short, but i like the more reliable and flexible way i setup the anti-spark loop key for these reasons.

IT depends on the following,

How much does your Vesc/esc pull or draw,

loop key should be ad-least the same AWG/size as the wire anything less will become the weakest part of the chain.

Stop after going up an especially big hill or using the most power you'd typically use --  and see if it's hot

If it's hot you should increase the size.  That goes for everything too, not just a loop key

No issue with anything frying there but wondering why you would want to do this?  Is the idea to be able to measure the voltage that's coming into the right side before it gets connected to whatever is on the left side?  Guess would be good to have some idea of what you're going for in the end.

With voltage testing you just want the meter in parallel with the spots you're measuring the voltage difference between and not in series but otherwise no major issues I'm aware of really.

Okay gotcha yeah was just having trouble figuring out what goes where in my head there... so if you want it only on when the loop key is connected would have the red wire from the volt meter going to the right side of the loop key connection so it's disconnected until the loop key is in there, if you connect on the left side then would be on all the time.

Anywhere along the negative lead going between the battery and ESC will be at the same voltage so would put it on either plug there (black wire in bottom right of image).

Also yes that's what I meant with the red one.

Really you could just have the red and the black hooked up to the plug on the right going to the ESC since ultimately that's what you're going after but any of the options of along the main red and along the main black going into the ESC are the same electrically (some small drop in voltage along the line aside)

It was not that hard to replace as the glue was sort of rubbery. It was tricky to glue in the new one though, trying to keep the glue from getting into the wrong spots. 

I think people who kill the resistor early are not pushing them 100% all the way in before riding. I always made sure of that.

@b264, @Andy87, or anyone else knowledgeable on the topic?

Just choose diameter according to the fusing current you want.

If I wanted it to fuse, I would solder an actual fuse to it.  I made that specific one rated for 135A+ continuous because I don't want it fusing.  Ever.

I've thought a lot about this, and everyone differs, but me personally, if the board starts severely malfunctioning while I'm at-speed in heavy traffic, I would prefer the battery stay connected as long as possible so I still might have brakes to stop while the board is burning-down.  If you'd prefer the loop key fuse-out to possibly save your expensive electronics instead, that's personal preference but I'd rather have the extra couple seconds of throttle response myself.  Once it fuses, you've got no brakes.

Basically it's 
ME > BOARD
or
BOARD > ME

I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt to myself over the safety of the board/battery itself.

In general, fuses should be rated to protect the wires behind it.

In this specific case, I'd fuse at the amps of the lowest component. Usually this is the 5.5mm dc jack. Next is the BMS charge max, then usually the charge wires (both positive and negative -- it's a circuit).

Fuses have some built-in room over their rating. If you oversize your fuse, it won't kick in in time to save your parts. (this may be true even if you perfectly size your fuse)

For example, for this specific mini blade fuse: https://www.littelfuse.com/products/fuses/automotive-passenger-car/blade-fuses/327.aspx

The Time-Current Charactistics table says:
- 110% of Rating: 100h Opening Time Min
- 135% of Rating: .75sec opening time min, 120sec opening time max
- 160% of Rating: .3s/50s
- 200%: .15s/5s
and so on.

So a 5 amp fuse will happily pass 5.5a most likely indefinitely, and will allow 6.75amps for up to 2 minutes.

(sorry I've been reading about fuses again)

No BMS I have ever seen is "charge-only"

They just have very low discharge rates like 10A or less, and we don't use that port.

"Charge-only" is more how you wire it up and not how the BMS is made.

As i don't want to cut my batteries leads, if i put bullet connectors where the blue arrows are is there any downside to this or reason not to? 

and is this correct loopkey? one side goes direct to battery and the other to the vesc.

Charger cable would be soldered onto the vesc wire and then in a bullet connector

Edit: I'm aware the wiring colours don't match up but i don't see that as a concern for this

Yes, it matters.

There are many reasons, 3 of which are

* If you accidentally don't push it in all the way and ride, the broken part that you have to replace is the "key" and not the "board" (the burnt resistor will be in the easily-replaceable key)
* It's easier to mount because you can JB Weld right to it instead of trying to leave exactly a 0.75mm gap all around it
* Your stuff is compatible with everyone else's stuff if, for example, you misplaced your loop key or needed another one or someone was giving one away for free

I've thought about it a lot for my build... Which side to mount to the board. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/custom-loop-key-dual/79963/2?u=skatardude10

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/custom-loop-key-dual/79963/9?u=skatardude10

Burning out the resistor probably would suck if you have it permanently mounted to the board and permanently wired in. Best to find a way to securely mount a female XT-90S that's easily removable.

I just went with bullet connectors and an M4 bolt that pinches a printed clamp. Very secure, and with a couple turns of the Allen wrenches I carry everywhere, I can disconnect the XT-90S from the board by unplugging the bullet connectors.

I feel much safer too potentially having exposed female side than two male pins in a wide opening 
incase my daughter just so happens to one day find the board and start poking around with her saliva fingers and I forget to cover it.

It will work out and is quite an elegant solution for using a dual 5/6s charger on both halves of the battery pack. Never thought about it... Edit: after some thought the synchronous charging might not work so you won't gain any benefit compared to the common way. You'd need to separate the halves on both poles to make it work.
When I want to charge my two halves at the same time I'll get a polarity error when I connect the second part. It works with two separate chargers though...

Ah good point I'll avoid that then! To be honest part of the reason for doing it this way was so I didn't need a BMS to charge a 10s pack - I could just separate them with loop key and charge each 5s group ndividually with my IMAX B6. So in this case balance leads won't be connected to anything except when charging, and even then they won't connect the two packs together.
Thanks for the heads up though!
