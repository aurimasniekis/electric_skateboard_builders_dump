So, readying crap on the interwebs and just stumbled on this - https://electrek.co/2016/11/02/tesla-panasonic-2170-battery-cell-highest-energy-density-cell-world-cheapest-elon-musk/

Now we just got to figure out how to get our hands on them in the future ;)

It sounds like they will be available in 2 months!  I thought they wouldn't be available to the general public but it's sounding like maybe they will be from this article.  Most energy density and cheapest are elon's words

I question of it'll be viable for esk8. Depends on discharge potential. Since Tesla's have such a huge parallel pack, they wouldn't need as high a discharge potential. Though it would help with cycle life if they did.

I was at the Gigafactory Grand opening where they will be producing these in the future and they are cylindrical.

You have to think about manufacturing costs too. It would likely be much more expensive to manufacture larger cells sense the tech for making cylindrical cells has been around for years

I think with more cells it equals more power too. And I might be wrong but it is more efficient since the cells are all all fused so I think if one goes, you pack doesnt get destroyed.

Bigger cells could equal more battery and less empty space for the pack I think as all the cells are spaced. And each cell requires so much steel and manufacturing.  Cells in parallel are effectively a bigger battery. Even the cylindrical shape seems  a waste. 
It's a new shape so I'd think it would need new development regardless.
I don't think it's inherently safer with redundancy, and surely the same safety features done now could be implemented w a bigger cell.  Less things to break.

You can calculate the discharge. They have roughly 100S70P pack. That means they use about 15 A a cell at 515 HP.  So these cells should be good for us. And the seem to have 3200mah.

If it's manufactured at the gigafactory it's likely Tesla-specific.  Unless Panasonic made a deal where they could sell them into other markets they'll all be going into cars and powerwalls.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if you want these in the next 5 years (before other manufacturers catch up) you'll need to buy a wrecked model 3.  Or we could start doing group buys on Powerwalls and divvy up the guts :-)

From everything I gather and what was said on the tours there, Its a partnership with tesla/panasonic. Even on the tour they stated that one side is the panasonic side where they will develop and build the batteries and on the other side, the tesla side where they put them into cars, powerwalls etc. I wouldnt be surprised if panasonic sells em direct once available. Elon's goal is not so much to keep everything proprietary, he actually opens all his patents to other manufacturers as long as they dont just try to capatilize and screw the vision of self sustainability.

They won't be making the batteries a different shape. Those packs in the cars have water cooling that circulates around the pack so they need the space between cells.

```
so 1KWH costs less than $190, so lets for our calculation set it to 190. 

Say they manage to fit in 5Ah in each cell. Then that means 3.7V*5Ah = 18.5Wh, number of cells to reach a capacity of 1KWH is round(1000/18.5) = 54 cells for a total of $190

if they have the same capacity as some of the standard cells say 3Ah, then each cell has 3.7*3Ah=11.1WH and the number of cells needed for 1KWH is round(1000/11.1) = 90 cells for a total of $190

Say it has the same capacity as samsung R25 i.e. 2.5A. Each cell contains 3.7*2.5A = 9.25WH and the number of cells needed for 1KWH is round(1000/9.25) = 108 cells for a total of $190


Crazy!!

I totally agree that Tesla is very good about open sourcing their stuff, but if you look at the backlog of Model 3's and Powerwall II's they need to get out I would guess that the total capacity of the gigafactory will be dedicated to just that one task for at least the next 5 years.

I doubt the contract with Panasonic would stipulate that they have control over the distribution of cels.

That said I hope you're right and I'm wrong :-)

fast charging doesn't correlate to high discharge. Even charging at 1C would be pretty fast if the charger supplies enough current. We know the Tesla pack as a whole has a high discharge potential, but we're talking individual cells here.

I have been reading into these 21700 cells and they sound pretty spectacular. Tesla/Panasonic are making them for the cars. Samsung are going to start making them for EV's but not planning mass production until 2021. I did find out about BMZ/Sony making them in Germany from here - https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2749193-BMZ-Sony-produce-new-21700-cell-3Tron

The specs are really nice - 
- 60% more capacity than conventional 18650 cells
- 400% current capability compared to conventional 18650 cells
- lighter than 18650 cells (!)
- double total lifetime
- more active cell material
- more beefy conductors

And they are already making them as it seems some guy called Gerd Giese has already ordered some and they are due to arrive with him this year. 

BMZ make packs for eBike's - http://www.bmz-drive.de/

Need to figure out how to source some and get a group-buy together maybe ;)

Specs posted above are marketing crap. 
21700 cells are 37% larger in volume than 18650, so a 50% increase in capacity isn't really that much specially when 18650 cells have a pretty large range of capacities, are we talking average or high end capacity? There are 3500mAh 18650 cells

A 400% power increase is also marketing speech. We already have 18650 cells that can deliver up to 30A continuous with the appropriate cooling. That would mean a cell that can do up to 120A continuous. 

Lighter than 18650? Doubt it. You're increasing the volume by 37% and increasing the energy by up to 50%, and you're saying less weight? That's not how the chemistry works.

Panasonic already makes a 20700 cell that is a slight upgrade to high performance 18650 cells for 3x the cost.

That is only valid if they are using exactly the same chemistry and Elon Musk has already stated that they are using different chemistry in their 21700 so others are probably doing the same. I'm hoping these 21700's are more than just a size upgrade. From the sounds of it, they have been designed from the ground up to be used in EV's and hi power systems. 

Must find a datasheet on these... I'm going to agg the shit out of BMZ and find out some details

You cant have both though, or at least not extremes of both. Your cell density is going to go up as you increase your power density, weight coming with it. With new chemistry and improvements on the design the increase can be kept low or non existent but still.

That's true but that was also a complete change in the overall chemistry. These new 2070 cells are still lithium cells. The chemical formulas are better and they're bigger, leading to the increase in output and capacity, but there's still no way you get all of that and lighter cells.

I guess they will be good if you like a very thin board with a small battery (lets say 10s2p). If choosing this cell you can still get a pretty good range while keeping the board slim. The only downside is torque since you do not have a lot amps available. 

In my case, I would choose a cheaper cell with a lower power density any day of the week. I can live with a bigger battery if the price is significantly lower. The Samsung 25r has dropped a lot in price, so that is my "go to" battery cell. I know that there is better batteries out there but they are more expensive as well....
