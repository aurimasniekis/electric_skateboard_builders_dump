I did my first soldering connection today and I know I need to improve because practise makes perfect but what do you guys think of this connection:

I've seen worse.
not bad for a first time.
remember Tin your wire and connector first and then heat them together.
try to use a smaller blob.

Ok thanks @lowGuido you are the man. I had trouble heating the wire from the bottom and melting the solder on the top of the wire. Should I use a higher degree of temp?

EDIT: Should I heatshrink the connection now or should I make some changes?

If you do the second one that large you'd risk a short because it's big. Xt60 are nice because the wire can sit inside of the gold lead. It really only requires half a pea size of solder. 

(Scientific measurement) lol

the trick is "drag" the heat out of the soldering iron with the solder.
you would have a hard time with the iron on the bottom and the solder on the top.

one day I will make a video.

Make sure that the tip of your iron also has some solder on it when you start to heat the wire from the bottom... solder is what transfers the heat. Also, hit the wire with a little bit of flux if you have it. it will help the solder to melting into (and in between the strands)

Another tip, idk your set up, but helping hands with clamps on both hands really really helps. I used to try soldering without and man, the joints you get from not using helping hands suck.

@lox897 - Not bad.. A good soldering iron goes a long way. I'd even it straight but without a hot soldering iron it would be hard to do that. Just brush it back and forth.

Easy to melt those XT60/XT90 plugs though with a hot soldering iron.

I have the same iron, and it may be worth changing the tip- the stock tip is a small point, and doesn't work as well for high gauge wire. I bought a chisel tip off of amazon, and it works like a charm. I find it way easier to get good solder joints with the new tip!

These are the steps I take:

Put iron on side of connector
Put wire in

I am on 400 degrees celsius. I might try and increase the temp a bit so the solder in the connector melts quicker. Is this a good idea?

some tips from my aircraft component soldering course

-keep tip clean so yes wipe on sponge after you solder something every time
-clean everything with iso before you solder
-use flux and flux core solder it makes everything flow soooo easy
-after use of the soldering iron melt a huge glob of solder on the iron to help protect it from oxidization. 


if you need more help let my know im on a course that expects us to solder at class 3

@lox897 I use just a wet sponge, cleaning between every join. I think that a combo of the cleaning wire and the sponge is better. Folks seem to make a big deal out of the heat "shock" that might occur with the wet sponge, but  I've had no problems. I also don't solder for a living, so it may get problematic if you burn through tips too often.

Also, @lox897, I admire your efforts to get better at soldering! Don't be discouraged if they come out badly while you're learning. Here's a pic of my first terrible attempt at soldering a dean's connection. I keep it on my bench to remember what *not* to do... It's a cold join, I didn't tin the wire, used a small tip at a low temp, and no flux. As you can see, the result is crap. But the failure helped me to learn!

LOL that looks like one of my awful first attempts as well when i was still using a 25watt iron. 

but once you get a nice hot one and learn a few tricks its quick, easy, and you get pro results. Tin everything, bond things while its still flowing, and make it quick so shit doesn't melt. 

I'm still sort of getting used to my new soldering station. I melted an old switch once practicing with it before i realized how hot it gets and how quickly it can flow old solder, and how quick you have to be with it when soldering tiny metal tabs on plastic parts. I'm so glad i got it now though, and i'm looking forward to upgrading one day to a bigger station with a heat gun attachment.

Guys, do yourselves a favour and get some flux. This thread is making cringe. 

http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/mg-chemicals/8341-10ML/473-1117-ND/2233037

When you apply to much heat or apply the heat for to long, all your flux inside the solder evaporate and burns out. You shouldn't need to apply heat for more than 3 seconds once you everything flowing.

@longhairedboy man you're making it hard to pick now! It cost me 5 soldering tip to get my board done, I am done with 30watt solder. If the pad has a heat sink (ESC with heat sink pcb), its impossible to get it done with 30watt.

It's listed at 70 watts but i thought it was 75. I must have been mistaken. Anyway its a decent station for the price and works really well for me, and it wasn't much more than my 25watt radio shack iron. And it comes with a solder spool holder, a sponge, and an extra element, and the tip cleaning metal sponge thing. And having an easy place to put the hot iron while it on is invaluable.

just wanted to add this though: Buy the hottest and nicest one you can afford if you are planning on doing a ton of soldering. This one is still kind of a cheapo, and i plan to buy a much nicer one, but it still a great iron. Eventually i want one with a hot air gun as well.
