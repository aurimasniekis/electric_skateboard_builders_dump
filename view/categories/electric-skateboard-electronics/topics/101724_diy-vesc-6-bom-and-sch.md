Hello people!
I made a few VESC4s but now its finally time to upgrade. I wanna make a VESC6. I failed to find a BOM and schematics though. 
Has anyone got them? Is it still open source? Nothing on Bens website on the BOM and sch. 
Thanks!

Schematics are on the site but no BOM or any other files. You'll have to design it yourself this time.

@stewii did it, I got 2 escape vesc 6 from him, they're cream, but unfortunately we miss him a lot since not showing up at the forum or replying DM.
But I'm with you man, there is some smart cookies over here, I want 15s vesc, I don't know more than is crazy complex to build an esc.
Did you check mother FOCer ESC? Looks promising

Now that I got into the rabbit hole, building an ESC using integrated chips like [this](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv8353r.pdf) seem pretty straightforward.

Just follow the schematic on page 29 and you have a crude ESC.

With a bit of ISP communication tinkering of course.
