I don't think I can do that with a chromebook, was just curious if anyone made a Chromebook program for the BLDC tool.

Do you have access to a terminal?

The BLDC tool is written for Ubuntu which is the same kernel, so ChromeOS is actually closer to native for the tool than Windows or a fruity OS would be

Try the Linux version

There are lots of Linux versions.  There is Vedder's version you can build yourself on github, there is also a VESC_Tool which is not BLDC_Tool and Ackmaniac has tweaked some stuff too

latest bldc tool
[/quote]

"latest" is very, very blurry.

Firstly, there are multiple tools, a BLDC Tool and a VESC Tool and an ESC Tool [by @Ackmaniac].  Which tool do you want to use?

There is one over here, that's the "ESC Tool" https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/extended-ackmaniac-esc-tool-based-on-vesc-tool/35116/200?u=b264

Just trying to save you man. Unfortunately Vesc and the gui tools are filled with hardware killing pitfalls, each hardware and software version with their specific niggles. IMO your question cannot be answerered safely by anyone but you, after copious research and perhaps a few dead vescs.

b gave you as much advice as you can expect without you reciprocating and learning on your own.

If you come back with specific questions after reading a ton you'll get more and higher quality help. But if we answer your questions as is, you'll likely end up in tears as you're missing a ton of background info.
