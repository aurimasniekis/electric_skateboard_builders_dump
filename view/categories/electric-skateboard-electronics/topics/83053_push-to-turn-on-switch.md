Honestly, I think it's a pretty small market at the moment. You're limited in choice.

Give it two months and I'm sure there's going to be loads.

The fatboy is pricey in 150A and up but it does seem resilient. A bit of a friendly price war would be good....

I've have some new switches from maytech for 12s batteries and so far they work well.

 Not this version, it's their first. So its just a switch and for a limited time im selling them for $35, the next version will have a push to start function and it will be $55. I'm expecting  samples for those in march

I really like my fatboy switch, the PTS doesn't work too well with hubs, but it's super reliable
