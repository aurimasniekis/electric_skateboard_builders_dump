Hi hi was just on my way on ordering A Vesc when I game across this

http://e-greenmotion.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=282

Think they are uk based which is perfect for me cuz Im in EU and price is very Good campares to others but the thing is I have Done quite a bit of reasearch here on the forum but No one has ever mention this one? It seems legit but is it? Has any one tried it? Does it look good? Because I dont want to spend A big amount of money on something untested so please people check it out!

@Jammeslu 
What do you want them to say?
"Yes buy them" or "No don't buy them"?
If you have specific questions you can just ask here or read that thread first:

It gets the job done. However, durability isn't ensured with these. For example: They got known firmware bugs and are more likely to be faulty when used at FOC.

Send them a message that you want it for 80$ a piece. They will prolly respond and tell you to pay 89$. Also you get free shipping
