Today i made my GT2b much more smaller. I just glued everything together :stuck_out_tongue:. Its not that much professionell like all the 3D Printed enclouses but it works^^. If you guys want to try this, put everything first together with zip ties and test it because u have to isolate all parts that are metal.

EDIT: Dont forget to test it and connect it before you glue it because its really hard to remove that stuff. I had a little short and accidentally broke the antenna while removing the glue with a scalpel.

Have you heard of https://www.3dhubs.com ?  You can get something printed locally for not much money. It's how I first started with 3d printing. :slight_smile:

There are two blue/white twist switches on the board. They are for adjustments. Before u glue it, connect your vesc and be sure its on 50%!

lol, seriously though, i like it. Finish it off with some epoxy putty and plasti dip and that could look real nice.

Better than money, all the internet points! To enclose that masterpiece would be akin to scraping the Sistine Chapel ceiling, keep it raw/hot-glued :sunglasses:

Yeah some said i should cover it with stuff but i like it this way. It feels surprisingly good in my hand without cover. Its easyer if you just make the glue round to make it more comfortable. (Holy moly i had to google 4 words in your Reply to understand it^^)

Moved the trigger to the other side as I think it is more ergonomic.  
BTW I didn't have to cut or soldier a single wire.  Even the channel 3 button works.

What do you mean? Are there hot glue skills? 

I plugged in my gun,  put in a stick and dipped everything in glue.  Making sure the stuff wouldn't burn my finger.  
That's what I did and that is what it's look like. :grin:

Might use ch3 to switch on a voltage display.

I planning on building a version 2 of my mod^^
With peeled battery, removed Plastic stuff, removed buttons (all buttons exept for On/off is not needed), and new soldered antenna for THE smallest (possible) GT2b mod.
Stay tuned i upload it when it arrived and modified in about 2-3 weeks :)

I think if you dont need to move things around (like replace battery) you could put everything in fast drying clay.. and then perhaps even paint it..! This way you should be able to get some nice shape and also more discreet look! 

Something like sugru would work wonders here, I think.. would be no need to print enclosure or something :)
```

## \#38 Posted by: SirDiff Posted at: 2016-12-14T21:31:00.834Z Reads: 163

I think that much sugru would cost a bit too much, and it's a too flexy to make an enclosure :confused:
```

## \#39 Posted by: Okami Posted at: 2016-12-14T21:33:37.524Z Reads: 171

yeah, sugru is the expensive way.. but it would be good for elasticity..

Fast drying clay (air drying) is not very expensive..It is usually sold to children for making crafts / figurines but the bad part is that it tends to crack when it is drying. 

Also some final coating will probably will also needed as it states it might soften with water but I have no tested it myself. 

Cracks can later be filled with some kind of glue or epoxy anyways.. The good part is that you can mold it into shape you need / like.

Here's how it looks:

There are different hot glue colors available, with black one and a little knife shaping it could look quite neat :grin:

Get 100% silicone from hardware store. Mix with corn starch and some food coloring = high volume cheap sugru

This option sounds the best! I think the feel would be quite good with this one and it would also has some elasticity.. clay would be rather heavy and brittle, silicon really sounds like a diy / cheap option.

I tried that but it didn't work for me.  The DIY shugru didn't stick to the plastic and the resulting lump was far too flexible.

So did you throw this idea away.. ?

I think there should be some sort of solution to put the 'disassembled' remote's pcb into some nice shape..

So something in between the flexy silicon and hard - brittle clay would be needed..
