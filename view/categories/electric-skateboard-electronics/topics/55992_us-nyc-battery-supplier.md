I‚Äôve been in contact with a few suppliers in China for flat electric skateboard battery packs and worked out an offer for Samsung 30Q 12s4p battery packs for as low as 250 usd. The original offer was for a test batch of 5 battery packs was 270 each, but I was allowed an offer of 2 12s4p Samsung 30Q packs for 270 instead. 

I am personally not looking to spend 540$ on my own for an extra pack I do not need. So if anyone is willing to try out this supplier with me to complete the 2 minimum required purchase that would be great. 

Keep in mind this is a risk, I‚Äôm willing to take. If this works out who ever purchased the pack with me would have access to the supplier aswell and could buy from them at this amazing price for as long as they like. 

Max dimension: 48*145*360mm or customized
Custom discharge connector: XT90, XT60
NYC pls

The battery looks good. Post your location and the packs dimensions. It may get a quicker positive response. 

Good price and good luck.

Ya I forgot to mention that too. Remove the ‚Äúgroup buy‚Äù from the topic or the mods will close this thread. You need to be a level 3/regular to organize a group buy.

Shipping can be very expensive for batteries, have you considered the cost? (from china)

Do you know what they used to make the battery pack so uniform and square?

Yeah I have and It‚Äôs an active discussion between the supplier and I, awaiting response. But the yellow board is a hard plastic that encases the entire pack. I‚Äôm assuming to protect the cells and allow the additional components to stay secure.

They use a grade A Seiko Battery Protection ICS, with over charge, short circuit, over voltage, and over discharge protection.

https://www.ablicinc.com/en/semicon/products/power-management-ic/lithium-ion-battery-protection-ic/

You can find more info on them through forums like endless sphere and I think on here too.

Any gutshots? Looks pretty on the outside.

That price seems almost unreal. 

I'm not sure how confident would I feel buying batteries from the biggest counterfeit market in the world, price usually is a good indication of being or not counterfeit

Would like some gutshots, I would join in on this with you if I had the money but sadly I don't.
The "bms" should have extensive testing and the pack should be thoroughly checked. The cells should also be checked and the pack should be abused like a motherfucker

Not sure how they managed to get the price down so low because that is nearly the cost of cells alone

They do look exactly like torqueboard's battery packs. I wonder if this is the same as TB's. But I trust TB more than I trust this.

That‚Äôs part of the reason why I want to try this supplier. To test. It‚Äôs a risk but if it turns out well then we have access to packs at wholesale price rather than market which is already too expensive.

If they are indeed legit I'd get one at that price...as long as shipping is reasonable...also I'd be willing to take the chance as long as we can use Paypal or something similar that would afford us a little protection from fraud/whatever bullshit

Some of the Information on the internals for the batteries are as follows:

AWG10# discharging wires , the nickel thickness is 2.0mm,,the black holder thickness is 1.0mm.

The BMS continuous current is 60A

The packs get tested before they are shipped, including test: discharging current, voltage , internal resistance etc.

And they take pictures of the products and send via email or text message for us to check before shipment.
