Hey there. It's not a terrible price, how much is shipping?

If you plan to do a build or two you can order from nkon at a quantity of 200 and get it down to 3.57 shipped(3.41 if you don't include shipping)

Yea man

https://ru.nkon.nl/samsung-inr-18650-30q-3000mah.html

200 should bring you to €600 shipped or $737.37

$736.37/200 = $3.68 per cell.. sorry conversion between euros my last purchase was $3.57 but still very cheap per cell

flat head or button top?
[/quote]

I've noticed button heads on newer cells seem to be added on to flat top, fixed in place with heatshrink. So same cell but a little taller.

You should get flat for packs

oh, i want to do that but when i did some calculations (i didn't know shit about batteries then) i realized that my plan of using 2x 300w speakers would drain the battery fast af and it would have to be super heavy

Even though this isn't a group buy I think there is a need to organize one for Canadian board builders
