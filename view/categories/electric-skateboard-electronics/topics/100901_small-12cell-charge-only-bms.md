Hi, I am after a small 12cell charge only BMS max measurements are 50x140mm and not thicker than a 20700b cell. Having a hard time to find any myself but maybe someone here got a tip? :)

i've got some of these on hand now if you need one, $30 shipped within US.

https://www.ebay.com/itm/323217175378

put these modules in 3 batteries now, all working nicely.  balancing current is a bit lower but does the job.

kind of lost faith with bestech (litech) after last batch of D140 bms were nearly all bad.

Damn :frowning:. My bestech D606 have been great on both of their batteries. I also have the one your showing there, still havenâ€™t gotten around to using it

Tiny BMS or Neptune 15, both are top quality but very expensive.

I'm running the Neptune 15 in my build.

Tiby BMS and Neptune are both to big :/ I was looking at this https://www.bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/BMS-D729V1.html
but really unclear if its what I need as the charge voltage/current isent filled in :/

DO NOT BUY THESE.

no balancing function.

i have two of em right now, no use for it at all.

one was self-discharging cell closest to pack+.

other one wasn't going into balancing despite cells being well within voltage variance.

measured resistance on bleed resistors and one was shorted, another had different impedance.

again, could be the batch i got, but between bad batch and shit customer service, looking elsewhere.
