I bought the following hub motor and was wondering which connector you would use to connect them to the vesc:

What's the name of these three "banana plug like" connectors? Would you stick with them or cut them and solder actual banana plugs?

They are bullet connectors. It says the size on the site.

Replace them, they tend to get loose and (because of that) melt. The sensor wires also need to be changed to fit, @rey8801 wrote something about that.

Hi, the phase wires have bullet connectors. Depends what you use on your VESC you will need to change it on the motor. At least 4mm connector, I would say.
For the sensor wire your need JST PH 6 pins. For the order you can find between my post in the GB thread that didn't work out at the end (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-group-buy-cheap-hub-motor-set-90-mm-canceled/42647?u=Rey8801)
