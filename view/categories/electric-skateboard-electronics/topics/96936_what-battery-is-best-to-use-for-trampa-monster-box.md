So guys I finally decided to buy a mountain board. I bought this one with 154KV motors.

I am a 170lb rider. I wanted a good combination of top speed and raw power so I chose 154KV. Good choice?

Also wanted some advice on what batteries are best to use. It seems that these are recommended by Trampa and they are out of stock.

Is there a battery builder on the forum who can help me out or can someone point me to where I can purchase the batteries? 

@topcloud Can you advise please?

In my opinion, this is the best battery you can put into the 2019 based on a multitude of factors including not being indirectly responsible for the great Northern California Wildfire of 2020:

777Wh pack, built by @thisguyhere 

and here is why:

Joe does exemplary work, very highly recommended.  

Modestly speaking, we could get just about any lipo in the world I suppose, yet I am selecting a second 12S6P battery from Joe for my Colab deck / Trampa everything else / 9" MegaStar on chains build.

Hope this helps my brother :)

Is that the largest pack that can fit in this box? @taz has used a 12S7P and says it can even fit a 12S8P.

@thisguyhere  Sending you a PM!
