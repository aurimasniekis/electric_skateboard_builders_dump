So currently I have a custom built pintail with a 10s4p space pack, 2 vesc speed controller's, a winning remote and torque boards motor mount running a pair of 190kv 6354 motors. I'd like to switch from outboard motor to hub motors if possible. Honestly I would just wait and buy raptor 2 hubs and trucks if I could. However, it looks like they won't be sold separately. I love my board and I don't want to change to deck or the bottom pan. I would just like a little more efficiency and less rolling resistance for coasting having ridden my friends Acton blink.  Any ideas? <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/0/00c8146fafd570b452936a430ff0c7f5871b8336.jpg" width="374" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/e/be110bdc65ea005e1bd83aabff9cb226f0b13d1d.jpg" width="374" height="500">

I have been running two of Dexter's hubs for a few weeks now, and I have been very happy with them in BLDC. I tried a single hub initially in FOC mode, but with the massive hills around me it wasn't enough. I'm using a space cell 3 10s3p. I also hear his new hubs coming in the next few weeks will be even more poweful and come with the option to use sensored.

I am getting a 4wd board made up with these hubs. They're sold out at the moment but if you can wait it out, it will be worth it. They bolt on to a variety of trucks without any modifications and run in FOC mode without any worries. My build on this forum is called black beauty for more information.

Hubs are less efficient. And not all of them have less rolling resistance.

I usually think modding a finished board is a bad idea.

Look into Carvon V3's, not technically hubs, but direct drive is just as good if not better than hubs. You do get the full urethane which is super nice!

It's not a mod I built the board I made the fiberglass pan from scratch, I designed the motor covers and printed them myself.....it would just be unhooking the motor wires and reprogramming the vescs....

Otherwise you could hold out a bit for the new DIY Dual Hubs. I think I might do that myself as the spec sheet looks pretty good! Does anyone have any thoughts on them? Does DIY have a decent reputation?

I know, I just mean its a finished board, that runs fine. and you are taking it back to project phase by changing the drivetrain.

it should be painless, but will the change be worth it?

It's a easy swap and I can easily swap back, unbolt trucks, bolt on new trucks, plug in 6 connectors, then reprogram. Done. However I wont do it until I can find a decent hub motor. Either a 6354 based hub or a 6374 based hub.

Carvon V3's ($599)and Dexters newest version ($380) come out this month. I have Dexters hubs and Carvons and both have really solid performace. I'm heavy and either pair of hubs does well over 30mph with me on them. I have 5 pairs of hubs and those are the only two I'd recommend from my experience.

I haven't tried the Maytech hubs. I like the square notch to prevent the stator from spinning on the axle though. At a glance though I'd say they are rated kinda low for my taste. 800w isn't much compated to 1800w for Dexters and 1500w for the new Carvon V3's, and even then I can still get them really hot with spirited riding.

It also says those hubs are a 60KV wind and only good up to 10S(36V) which would equate to about 18mph with the 90mm diameter wheel. That's not quite fast enough for my likes. Even at 12S they would top out at 21mph. That's probably plenty fast for lots of eskaters though and 800w might me ample for lighter riders. I'm over 260lbs, so I need heavy duty setups haha. I have a 4wd board with Dexters hubs and a beast battery, it will climb any hill Ive found like it's flat, and pulls to 40mph faster than my car! My 140 pound friend can't even accelerate full power as it burns out with all 4 wheels lol! Sorry I digressed hahaha.

The Maytech with 290lb man on 36v 10s go 20+ a few mph . :)  I imagine 12s would go faster (I'm pretty sure you can run them at 12s....but don't quote me) and better yet 4wd even faster to pull a big boy.

Hummies next generation motors will hopefully begin testing soon. It should fix all of the issues, and will be the most powerful hub motor ever made (besides the last one, which was just too big, lol).

Give it a few months and you'll likely see them market.

I thought long about which hubs I'd buy. Ended up saving for Dual Carvon V2.5's.

They are overpriced. But they also are durable, clean looking, strong and (for my 130 Pounds) faster than anything I'm even considering.
Expecting nothing less for V3's.

What you may want to consider is wait just a tiny bit and check out reviews for new Hummies/V3's or waiting for the V2.5 prices to drop.

Many other less known options out there though which I don't know much about.
Just as a firsttimehubbuyer avoid anything that looks to cheap to be true without reviews!

All of them Im sure lol. In all serioisness, I'm confident I'm summing well over 100A accelerating from a low speed but I'll log a couple runs and report back. I initally had all 4 wheels set at 200 motor amps and 50 battery amps but everyone who tried it except for me said it was so fast it wasnt fun anymore so I dialed it back some and settled at 30 battery amps and 120 motor amps per wheel. I also reduced the start up boost and current ramp settings which tamed it quite a bit. Ive got all four VESC's connected via CAN BUS and have a mirco USB extention on the side of the enclousure so I can tune all 4 speed controllers without dissassembly.

So I'm in the same boat as you, I can tell you that nothing is made for a guys our size. I wouldnt recommend hub motors for heavy guys unless you want to build a 4wd and are willing to drop some serious $.  The Torqueboards hubs and the carvon hubs are the only ones Ive used with success, but at your weight, even those will get hot if you climb any hills or go fast for very long. If I let my 140lb friend ride my dual carvon board he can go zoomimg back and forth and up and down hills and the motors are barely warm. 1 lap around the block with me on it and they are already getting dangerously hot. I built a 4wd board wth the torqueboard hubs and that really dropped the temps of the motors but 4 hub motors and 4 VESC's and a battery with enough umph to drive them is gonna cost you!

How much would a 4WD hub motor setup be better in gravel road situations than a 2WD hub one?  
  
Altho I could always make my board such that i can easily convert it to either 2WD or 3WD, especially If I know I won't be using 4WD for a period of time. Heck, my single belt can almost get me everywhere if there wouldn't be such sideways motion from 1WD  
I'm probably thinking too much if I can rathen than if I should..

Yea this is the second time I've warrantied off this Acton blink. I've now had to shoot 4 videos of it completely failing. That motor is shit. Then the board just up and died and we sent it off for a warranty and after 4.5 weeks of waiting we got it back. It worked but continued to have complete motor failure about 10 minutes into riding. Now it's back off to Acton again for warranty. It was purchased in April and in 4 months I'd has spent half of that for warranty. Fuck acton.

Hi all,

It looks like this thread has been quiet for a while but I was wondering if anyone can recommend some hub motors for a dual motor setup.

Any help would be appreciated.

You don't understand hub motors are more efficient. Their is a big difference between torque and efficiency. Hub motors are like a honda civic. Civic's are fast if you set it up right. Some people even have managed to get 40+ mpH off hubs.comparing  a civic to a mustang makes no sense. The mustang being belt driven. Yes you can get bigger motors, however your always going to be at the mercy of friction. Hubs have only 1 thing that turns. that is what makes it efficient..

It's not only about the rolling resistance. It's the fact that hub motors do less work than belt drive motors. Belt drive rely's on belt tension and tooth ratio and a ton of other stuff. Hub motors just go. They only turn 1 thing the wheel which creates propulsion. The future is looking bright for all electric sports cars. Mustang by ford is guiding the direction of high performance electric sports vehicles. Think of it like a tesla compared to a porshe. Their both very fast cars, however Tesla is much more efficient.

If size weren’t a limitation a direct drive could be more efficient but otherwise gearing is more efficient.

It's a metaphor. Besides you wouldn't be able to see it yet because I have inteligence on ford. But yes they are developing a direct drive much like the 911 by Porsche. The reason you can't find ford's models yet is because that is the direction that ford is heading towards.

No and no. We are talking about a car here right?  I'm no expert on ev's but I think they have motors for each of the wheels. I was saying that in the future ford is going to come out with an ev similar to Tesla no gas. But, to make  it even simpler, a comparison would be a Ferrari being the belt drive and the Tesla Direct drive. A Ferrari is much less efficient than a Tesla as Direct drive motors are more  efficient.

Saying direct drive is more efficient is a generalization u can’t make and depends on the load.  Tesla as an example I bothered to look up uses roughly 9:1. That’s not direct drive and they know what they’re doing.  If they used a bigger motor it would be more efficient with less gearing until eventually it would be more efficient directly driven.  The efficiency of direct drive coming from no gearing which is a slight loss.   The reason direct drive is nice for skating is its simplicity, lack of maintenance and reliability

This!   You claim to have inside info on this. Please elaborate on their program and drive system. Interested in how Ford is currently guiding the direction of the high performance ev market from a company who has one crappy ev they dropped in 2018.

Ford does not have any ev. As of now they have a HEV hybrid electric vehicle. In case you still don't know that means it can take gas and electric. Ford is actually dropping most of their gas vehicles besides the mustang.

This is another vehicle but strangely describes direct drive this way:
“The torque doesn’t hit the wheels instantly despite the direct-drive system. The belt-driven gear reduction setup at the front wheels allows power to come on like a wave”
