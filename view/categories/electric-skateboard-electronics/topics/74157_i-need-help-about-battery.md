I am trying to build my DIY electric mountainboard I bought most of things and I did list about what I bought. Now I have to buy batteries. I will buy 5000mah two batteries but how much C I need? 
What I bought:

[Board ](https://www.mbs.com/boards/10102-mbs-colt-90x-mountainboard-constellation)
[Motors ](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html)
[ESC ](products/torque-esc-bldc-electronic-speed-controller)
[BMS ](https://tr.aliexpress.com/item/10-s-45A-60A-PCM-PCB-BMS-Koruma-Devresi-Kurulu-36-v-Lityum-Pil-Paketi-i/32843449566.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.b8144c4drnXOKZ)
[Receiver ](https://tr.aliexpress.com/item/2-4Ghz-Electric-Skateboard-Remote-Controller-With-Receiver-Universal-for-All-ESC-Longboard-Skate-Board-Scooter/32817830821.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.b8144c4drnXOKZ)

Edit: batteries will be  series !!!!

C rating is seriously inflated on most lipos. So it's worth going for a higher rating.

Graphenes from hobbyking are not bad at 20-30c

Zippys you should aim for 60.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong please.

bro the graphenes have far higher discharge at like 60-90c. the Zippy FlightMax's have a 30-40c output at 8ah 5s

You are correct, personally I use 20-25c and they work perfectly with only a little bit of sag

Correct, C rating is often inflated. Graphenes are good. Are you connecting 2 5000mah batteries in series or parallel? If in parallel, c rating doubles. 5000mah x 30 = 150 amps per battery.

Actually c rating doesn’t double, capacity does thus more amp out put.

@mynamesmatt graphenes aren’t actually 60-90c tho what he’s saying is that in reality they are 20-30c

Lol. More amp output translates to higher c.

Erm no, c rating is the multiplication output of the battery. It is c rating x mah. If you double c rating then some people will also double the mah and end up with incorrect numbers.

C rating is NOT amp out put. Amp out put is c x mah
```

```
C rating is the continuous current that can be drawn from a battery. Each parallel connection increases the continuous current ability of the total pack by the adding the c ratings together thus doubling in a 2p pack.
```

```
NO. C rating is not current output. The amp output is the c rating times the mah. They are separate things. The reason the amp output increases is because you are adding more mah thus a high multiplication.

Just buy the graphenes. If you get 20c that equals 100 amp continuous. 3 minutes of fun if you run at full current output til empty

Ok buddy whatever. Maybe you should focus on how much current you will need, and then pick a battery that will support that decision.

"thus a high multiplication" is a false statement. C rating of a battery is measured in (mAh) (c) which equals current output. If you add a battery of same c rating in parallel, you add the two Max current outputs together. No multiplication involved.

Bruuh...

10s5000mah 10c 
5ah x 10c = total output of 50a

10s10000mah 10c output
10ah x 10c = 100a 

I get what you’re trying to say but noobs will go “oh ok so c rating doubles” and go 

10ah x 20c = 200a

So, series [Battery](https://www.pilottr.com/urun/gensace-5000mah-45c-5s1p-lipo-batarya.html) x2 enough or not ?

Sounds like current output is sufficient. Range might be short. I like big batteries, and I cannot lie!

I have a 12ah battery on my street board. No range anxiety. Pneumatics cut range in half, so keep in mind that a 2p will be like only 5ah on pneumatics

How much range do u want? How much do you weigh, and what's the terrain like? Hills? Flat?

Correction, 2p will be 10ah, but will act like a 5ah would because of the pneumatics.

I think a 10ah battery will be fine for that. I personally would probably shoot for a 12ah 36volt to be on the safe side, but size restraint can be an issue. Are you mounting on top or below deck?

It will be in top side

Go big with the battery. You'll never be dissatisfied with a big battery. The higher the ah the less strain you will put on it, and it will perform better and last longer. If I were doing a top mount, I would build a giant brick of 21700 cells spot welded together in parallel packs with nickel strip, and braided copper wire for serial connections. Lol. it would be a lot more difficult than just buying some lipos and connecting them. Probably a good idea to start with the lipos, and then eventually get into building your own batteries. just make sure you protect the lipos well they have a tendency to swell and can rub against the case or each other under vibration.  Swelling and rubbing can lead to venting and possible fire.  Not trying to scare you, but you may want to watch a few videos on battery safety.

Remember one thing: mountain board uses >20wh/km.
This means that on flat surface, 10ah will get you 3,7x10x10=370wh
370/20=18.5km of range.

AliExpress has rebranded 21700 cells that are phenomenal. You can buy 40 cells for $120.  4000mah each. You could build a for 4P10s pack. 4p would get you 60amps continuous current which is enough battery current. You can use 18650s. I like the 21700 because they are less quantity to weld together. I have these particular cells in a build right now. Phenomenal battery pack!![Screenshot_20181110-092449|281x500](upload://8tPqtCIeqBAFaF3huN6uo5NFoZ7.jpeg)

Not exactly true. Litokala are rebranded cells. I've used them in many batteries. Even in a high current ebike. I've never had issues with them. ![IMG_20180903_142743037|666x500](upload://fnqXXCA48Rm9Iuf8SHdbXcsLJRZ.jpeg)  this bike will do 60 miles per hour! I'm pretty sure the cells are real. You should do your research before you call something fake. Thanks

Just buy the big lipos.  You can build a battery in the future. You won't be dissatisfied with the 16ah lipos. They will get you 20km. Buy the best rated ones you can afford. Read the reviews. I personally like the graphene professionals.  Like what was said earlier, c ratings are usually inflated. At 75 kilos, 20-30 C continuous on a 16ah battery, you'll be flying with the right gearing.
