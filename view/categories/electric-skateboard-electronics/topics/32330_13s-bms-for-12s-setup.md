Hi guys,

I was wondering if anyone has used a 13s BMS for a 12s setup. I've seen a few posts with people using a 10s BMS for their 9s setup. The 13s BMS's are about $14 usd. Whereas the 12s BMS's are $45 and up.

I have 4 4500mAh 3S 30C Lipo Batteries:

Here is a link to BMS I'm interested in: https://www.banggood.com/48V-13S-45A-Li-ion-Lipolymer-Battery-Protection-Board-BMS-PCB-With-Balance-p-1177705.html?rmmds=mywishlist

Here is the charger: https://www.banggood.com/48V-14AH-Lead-Acid-Battery-Charger-For-Electric-Bicycle-Bike-EU-Plug-p-936105.html?rmmds=mywishlist

And here is a link to an equally cheap 12s bms

I'm not recomending this one though.  Just the first I found.  I do recommend matching your bms with the battery cell count

Edit. That one was for life
This one is for lion.  http://s.aliexpress.com/JV3UNbaA
21$

Thanks man! Chargers are still way too pricey for 12s. Even the ones on aliexpress are $95 after shipping.

The charger you posted will not work for 12s Lion or Lipo
It's a 48v charger designed for lead acid batteries and you need a 50.4v charger for 12S lion/Lipo

Just save money to a decent charger and a decent BMS. Don't cheap out on stuff that makes a difference. If you get the cheapest things you will still end up buying new things when they break.

Yeah I'm thinking that's the best bet.
