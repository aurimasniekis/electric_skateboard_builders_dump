Hi ESK8 community,
I'm building some kind of eScooter, and bought Alien electronics
- APS 130Kv (6374) sensored motor
- APS 120A ESC.
- 48 tooth and 12 tooth GT2 pulley
- 10S battery

My question is about the APS Firmware that I should use with this ESC. In the APS update software, I'm getting a lot of different ones, like Car16S_UV45, Skt16S_V40, etc.
Can someone tell me whats the meaning of the U,V,S suffix of these firmware ?
And maybe, which one would be the best in my case ?

Thanks

I just wanted to be sure that I used the right one, mostly because of the sensored motor. I don't really know if the sensor is used or not, and wanted to be sure of that.
Also, if you have the same ESC, have you tried to tune some options ? Like motor timing or so ?

I have disabled the reverse, set the braking to 30%, because the original braes were too strong and now it runs smoothly :) I dont remember if I did anything else...
