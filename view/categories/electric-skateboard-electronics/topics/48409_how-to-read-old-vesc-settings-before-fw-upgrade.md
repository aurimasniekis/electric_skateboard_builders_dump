When i connect my FOCBOX to the vesc-tool, it says that i have to old fw and need to upgrade. And thats fine, i will do that. The problem is, that i can`t remember my old settings (bat max/motor max etc) And it would be nice to know them, before i upgrade. Is their no way to se my old settings in vesc-tool ? Seems to me linke a bug, that i can`t do that ?

Thanks...

I believe you will have to read them using the old tool and save (save xml button) them, than upload the same file to the vesc tool and click write.

There must be a link on the forum somewhere, try searching for whatever tool you have.
What version do you need?

One of the first version of vesc tool. Can't remember the exact number. But there must be another way. I dont think, that i'm the first who wants to know my settings before upgrade.
