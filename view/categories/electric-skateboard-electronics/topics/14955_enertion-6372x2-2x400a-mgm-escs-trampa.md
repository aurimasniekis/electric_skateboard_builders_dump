Hi, I'm building a dual drive 12s Trampa MTB using enertion's 6372 motors, with all the problems people are having with high voltage, high output esc's burning out I've decided to splurge out and buy some super expensive MGM 400A items.
 TMM 25063-3 for Cars X2-SERIES
Does anyone know how much amperage these motors can handle?

My mistake these controllers are rated at 250 continuous 360A peak

250A is a bit overkill :D

Rather be over kill than burn up esc's üòè
