Hi all,

I have read lots of topics about this same thing but I don't understand it 100% and I would like to be sure before I start soldering. 

Mainly it comes from this 2 topics:
- https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/help-with-bms-for-10s4p-samsung-q30-cells/39022
- https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bestech-hcx-d596-the-new-80a-bms-wiring/41047/6 

The thing is, the balance wires connector that comes with the Space Cell battery is too big to fit within the Bestech BMS so I have to cut the big connector and wire it to the one that comes with the BMS.

Now, my question is regarding the wiring ORDER with the 11-pin BMS connector (there are some with 10-pin). 

Space Cell battery comes with negative in B11 and positive B10-B1 from left to right:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/3X/2/a/2a5d470863ee4d430a8307a255c6fb3ff1fd7d40_1_375x500.jpg

BMS pins order looks like that (B11-B0 from left to right, on that order):
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/3X/b/8/b84d3ea0823740341d3eed39c4410d3181af8b17_1_690x367.jpg


Then,
- Negative on the BMS should go on B0?
- If that's right, I have to put B11 from Space Cell onto B0 of BMS?
- Positive wires go same order? Or do I have to invert order?

Thanks a lot!

draw it out on paper or using ms paint or whatever - make sure you get the plug from the bms and pack aligned correctly (look for the  ridges at the top)

use the datasheet from besttech anything else could have errors

if you are still stuck or want confirmation post the drawing here

Can you take a picture from the datasheet?
I use the same bms in my battery packs. I have drawn something out for you. 
I hope you understand....
You should actually turn the entire connector around

Thanks man!

This is really really helpful! Actually I checked the datasheets but since I'm not an electronics expert I came here with all these open questions.

My guess was exactly that one, it seems I need to swap the order of all wires, but I was really afraid to do it without confirmation.

Thanks @Acido, I saw that diagram before but it confused me as balance wires are drawn together with the red/black power wires... too complex :frowning:

Then, this is what I have planned, I hope it's fine!
