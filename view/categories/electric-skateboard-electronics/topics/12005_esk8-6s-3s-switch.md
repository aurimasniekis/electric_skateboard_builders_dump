Has anyone here ever made/purchased a 3s to 62 switch?  What I mean is a switch that would allow you to power the board off, hit the switch (changing from 3s to 6s / 6s to 3s), then power the board back up.

I have some ideas on how to wire it but I figured why reinvent the wheel.

definitely possible.  Personally I would never run 3s.  too inefficient, too high amps.  6s is my bare minimum.

Why would you wan to try to run 3s?
6s is already very low torque.

I can only go so fast in the warehouse, would save battery, sometimes just wanna crawl, etc.

Its pretty easy to do that, just use a SPST switch.
Lemme draw it up for you 1 sec.

Do 6s. 
6s is slow and very easy to control

My board does 15mph at 6s, I'm just looking for an easy way to limit that and extend battery life.

Get a vesc, I did 3s because I wanted less speed, but the torque hit is quite big.
