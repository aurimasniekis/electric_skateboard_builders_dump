Hi my fellow France-living counterparts...!

I was wondering, would anyone be prepared to buy some items from Evolve (French website) and forward them to me in the UK please?

I'd pay you via PayPal and pay you for your inconvenience...

Many thanks :thumbsup:

I could help. I'm in Switzerland though and their German site would be the way to go. What parts are you looking for?

I've no idea but I've been after it for AGES!! lol

I've placed two orders so far, both have been refunded back to me telling me I need to go to Evolve UK because they're for "Customers in France only!"

+1 you should be able to get better results than me. 

They just told me by phone they can't sell me in bulk unless I do actually have said number of boards owned (Evolve French customer...) so I can't help further :frowning:

I tried through motive of group buy.
