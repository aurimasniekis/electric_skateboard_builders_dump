Hey there. I‚Äôm rehashing the VESC into a cheaper 2 layer version with external FETs. I‚Äôll call it the Cheap VESC for now. You may notice it resembles the generic ebike controllers that you can find on ebay/aliexpress. This is a version that would probably cater more toward the ebike/e-scooter community but probably could still fit just fine on a skateboard. The primary goal here was to make a version of the VESC that is cheaper to create by reducing the original design to 2 layers (check out JLC PCB for super-duper cheap 2 layer boards) and reduce BOM cost a little. The secondary goal was simply to improve my own PCB layout and design skills by taking on this challenge. I still haven‚Äôt finalized the design but I would say I am at least 95% done with only a few minor problems to tidy up. I also have a thread on the endless sphere that I encourage you to check out. Feel free to make suggestions and ask questions. Note that this is my most complex board design for me so far with my previous experience being only with simple audio effect boards and circuits.

Cheap VESC

Advantages

* Lower build and BOM cost

* TO-220 FETs allow for big heat sink attachment for better thermal performance

* SMD components no smaller than 0805 make hand assembly practical

* Added ON/OFF capability to turn off control circuitry when controller is not in use. A simple mechanical switch will achieve this when connected to the ‚ÄúON/OFF‚Äù 2-pin header.

* Can fit in typical "350W" ebike enclosures

* Can fit in Hammond 1590b enclosures

Disadvantages (that I know of)

* Larger than original VESC. Cheap VESC is 45mm x 92mm

* Higher profile with TO-220 package FETs

* Additional assembly steps to beef up high-current traces. 2 layers of 1oz copper can‚Äôt handle the current flowing through during operation. Assembler will have to apply wire/solder wick/bus bar to the exposed Power, Ground, and Phase traces that you can see in the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù image.

*Less than ideal layout for reducing loop area and inductance. Nothing crippling IMO but will be addressed in the future HV version.

Features of Future Versions (Calling them the High Voltage (HV) 6 and 12 FET versions)

* Implementing DRV8353 for higher voltage operation (I estimate at least 20s capable). Will need stable version of VESC 6 firmware/software for the 3 phase current sensing and stuff.

* On-board circuitry for no-spark connection

* On-board Bluetooth capability for interface with Open Source Android app for the VESC

*A 12 MOSFET version with the FETs in parallel for even greater power.

*Experimentation with mineral oil filled enclosure for improved thermal dissipation. I am aware of potential wicking issues. I am aware that circulation improves thermal performance. I will be conducting a "before and after" analysis for seeing if it's all worth it.

Further Notes:
I intend to test the design rather thoroughly after I get a version assembled. I intend to power a motor under load with different loads while observing temperature with a thermal camera. I will test other features of the design to ensure quality. Because of all this, it will be some time before I release the design files as Open Source. I don‚Äôt want to give the community a broken thing.

See existing thread here [https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=97699](http://)

All this wouldn‚Äôt be possible without Benjamin Vedder‚Äôs hard work to build on. Please consider supporting him for his efforts through the link below.

Just the board and BOM is $30ish USD if you use JLC PCB, LCSC, and get free samples from TI. You can make an account on their website and snag 5 free samples of most ICs. Also, you can get cheap STM32s the same way you just gotta pay for shipping. 3 STM32s were $9ish with domestic shipping from the ST site.

I expect this to handle at least the same current from the original 4.12. Ideally it handles even more due to the ability to heatsink the FETs. I will be testing it's current handling limits in a lab with a motor on a dyno.

This idk unfortunately. I'm not an experienced user of the VESC or it's spin-offs so I personally can't compare them. I will be having a few people test this design in their rigs to get feedback on performance.

Exacly! Thank you. This is meant to be cheap if you DIY. Prices for large quantity manufacturing is a different story. 

I appreciate the warm welcome from everyone so far! I hope to have some initial results soon as I'm populating my first board today. Wish me luck!

I see this performing at least as well as the VESC 4.12 but probably better because of the ability to heatsink the FETs well. The future HV versions will be candidates for your "pro" versions.

Yes. 1 board for the DIYer is $30ish. Volume would be cheaper like you said depending on which FETs you use and a few other variables.

Well I am making my own direct drive motors and planning to pair with a 12s setup. I still miss the vesc so if you need tester I could try the "pro version" of you end up making it. Are you thinking to a single vesc or a dual configuration? Most of the builders use it for dual set up anyway, maybe that will keep the cost lower since you would need only one board and some hardware is shared.
Are you going to use a hot air station for making it? 
Of course I do not want anything for free. I could try it and send it back to you or other users. I can also buy it later if it performs well. If the heatsink is needed then I will make the design and machine it. Anyhow, great work! :wink:

92mm x 45mm x 23mm(approx). I reduced the Caps from 1000uf to 680uf so the board height would allow for fitting in the hammond enclosure. Before the change the caps were taller than the FETs.

I haven't considered a dual setup before but I believe it could be a future variant. Shouldn't be too hard to combine the layouts of 2 boards into one. I will be using a hot air reflow station for soldering. I've already done the top side and just gotta finish the bottom. My idea of the heatsink would just be an aluminum bar attached to the FETs, then mounting the aluminum bar to the inner wall of the enclosure. This would the easy way for a DIYer but by all means machine an awesome heatsink!

Just wanted to say that too.
Please @shaman stay with a single design.
A dual heat sink box is more than enough, no need to combine the pcbs and share components.
One thing you maybe could consider to solve if not solved yet. The old 4.12 design had the problem that if you use CAN bus to control both vesc and the CAN bus got disconnected while both where powered on it was very likely that the communication port got fried too.
In some newer designs of the focbox for example was this problem solved (unfortunately idk how)

I was referring to no-spark connection for when one is connecting the battery.  Essentially would be a pre-charge circuit for the bulk caps. The connector for the cheap vesc is mini usb (idk what was i thinking...) and was going to use micro for the HV versions. USB C seems overkill.

Honestly I think it's better to keep a separate antispark switch / power supply because it allows more freedom.  For example, some folks want auto poweroff, some want roll-to-start (no power switch) and all the other things regarding integrating other lights and accessories mean that builtin antispark switches are less desireable.  Plus, if they fail, then the whole ESC has to be replaced...

This is a very good question that I looked up myself back when I was investigating the DRV8323 as an option. Source/sink current limits for driving FETs is a very important number. It translates to how large of a a gate charge your FETs can have or how many in parallel can you run. The DRV8353 has lower current source/sink numbers but this will be ok with FETs that have an appropriately sized gate charge to match. TI's NEXFETs can offer low Rds on still with low gate charges that will do well here.

So I have several people interested in testing my controller between here and the sphere. I do need these testers so that I get good data form several different use cases. The problem is sourcing the amount controllers needed for the testers. There's no way that I can make multiples of these controllers by hand during my spare time. Some testers may be able to solder the boards up themselves but that leaves plenty of opportunity for human error (just like in my own prototype so far). I'm considering having a PCB assembly service make some of these for me but I don't have the cash to front for that. https://www.7pcb.com/ quoted me about $600 for 15 boards. I have a couple of questions for this community...

Do you guys think it would be successful to have a gofundme or patreon or something like that to help with these kinds of things? If not, what would be the alternatives?

Theres group buys. But your are too new here to facilitate one of those 

Or theres a user called @Samau18 who lives in Hong Kong and seems like he has good thing going when it comes to PCBA. Maybe he can make some of these boards. He already makes BMS's for this forum and it looks like he has a good attention to detail

[quote="shaman, post:51, topic:81344"]
So I have several people interested in testing my controller between here and the sphere. I do need these testers so that I get good data form several different use cases. The problem is sourcing the amount controllers needed for the testers. There‚Äôs no way that I can make multiples of these controllers by hand during my spare time. Some testers may be able to solder the boards up themselves but that leaves plenty of opportunity for human error (just like in my own prototype so far). I‚Äôm considering having a PCB assembly service make some of these for me but I don‚Äôt have the cash to front for that. [https://www.7pcb.com/ ](https://www.7pcb.com/) quoted me about $600 for 15 boards. I have a couple of questions for this community‚Ä¶

If I could make some suggestions, for testers---

* only one or two in sunny California
* at least one in each hemisphere
* one in a hot, sunny place
* multiple in a cold, snowy place
* one in NYC specifically

That way you can really test the product

Project Update

I've got good news and bad news.

Good news:
I got the software loaded up. I was able to see real time temperature and stuff. 

Bad news:
No spinning motors yet. I have a weird situation surrounding the USB and ST link connection. The VESC tool only maintains a connection when both the ST link AND the USB cable are plugged in. Removing one or the other causes the VESC tool to lose connection. Don't know if it's a software/driver issue or a hardware issue. Probably the latter. I can still probably spin a motor tomorrow even under this condition. Will have to eventually resolve this issue though.

I want to verify that the USB 5V power does not actually connect to anything on the VESC right?
```

To clarify, power has been coming from a separate bench top power supply straight to the main DC power input. I will still verify if the USB is grounded tomorrow. I'll fix that if it is. If not, more debugging to follow.

So the ground seems ok after doing continuity checks. I may try a different computer with a clean install of the STM drivers, bootloader, and vesc tool. I have a spare STM32 if comes down to swapping that out. I may not make much progress until next week as I'll be out of town starting today.

Just seems like a good ol fashioned "turn it off and back on again" did the trick. Now I've issues with the current sense part of the system. 

I get a weird "ghost current" reading from the Real Time data. It shows motor current at 0.35A when everything is idle and no motor is connected. My power supply doesn't register this much current being drawn. I believe there's something up with the current sense portion of the system. Could be a bad reference voltage or solder bridge somewhere. Could also be the DRV. I'll be troubleshooting this today and on into the week if need be.
```

## \#93 Posted by: shaman Posted at: 2019-01-29T13:21:22.214Z Reads: 232

```
So I went through an elaborate debug to try and fix the "ghost current" issue. Swapped out both the DRV and STM32 without much improvement. I did discover the TRUE reason why I was having the USB/STlink issue. Simply leaving the STlink connected to the VESC even without being plugged into the computer hijacks the reset pin. Must remove STlink completely after loading bootloader. 

Nothing I did resolved the "ghost current" and minute amount of duty cycle percentage that was being displayed. I found out that this seems like normal behavior of an idle VESC after viewing the video from the link below and other screen shots of people's VESC real time data. Real time data at 1:18 in the video is the same as mine showing approx. 0.3A and 0.1% duty cycle. 

Can anyone else confirm that this normal behavior?

## \#94 Posted by: shaman Posted at: 2019-01-29T15:57:51.307Z Reads: 234

So I made a mistake on the schematics. I accidentally mixed up the phase and current sense signals. I have SENS1 to H1_VS, SENS2 to H2_VS, and SENS3 to H3_VS. I have SH1_A and SH1_B measuring H1 current and SH2_A/B measuring H3 current.

The correct schematics have SENS1 to H3_VS, SENS2 to H2_VS, and SENS3 to H1_VS along with the current sense opposite of mine. 

It bothers me that I didn't catch this with as many hours I spent staring at the schematics of both my controller and the official VESC 4.12. I don't think this is contributing do the "ghost current" readings but we'll see.

Regardless, I'll have to do either a hardware fix by doing PCB surgery to swap the signals paths around or modify the firmware to accept the hardware configuration as is. Just know that is solvable and not project killing. Either way, I'm fixing my schematics and PCB design so that they align with the original VESC 4.12. I don't want people to have to upload custom firmware for my controller if it's not necessary.

So there's a lot of .c and .h files associated with the VESC firmware and I'm too inexperienced with it all to try and find every little variable that I need to change to accommodate my hardware mistakes.

Nah it's the same DRV and such from 4.12. The reason I'm hesitant on the firmware is that I've read where there's more to it that just those values you have mentioned. The thread from the link below addresses my situation but just from a different 4.12 VESC variant. The original poster never followed up so idk if the issues were resolved. Also, I also have anxiety about screwing up the firmware and blowing up my controller.

This "mix up" of mine will absolutely be corrected in the PCB design and schematics. The controllers for testers will not have this issue and neither will the final release. Folks will be able to use the standard firmware for the 4.12 hardware once its all said and done.

In your case it should be fine. Simply set like 3A for motor max and battery max to keep currents low if something goes wrong, And i hope you will switch in the future to DRV with higher voltage. I like the idea of a cheap high voltage VESC for ebikes which don't need crazy high amps.

So aside from the asthetics and price tag, these will be the same as every other VESC derivatives?

This is a lot different from other ones.  It's not as small and easier to construct and far easier to attach heatsinks to.  If you can solder one DRV8302, you could handmake this entire thing.  And who knows if a vendor will sell the boards with the DRV and MCU presoldered

I got good news guys!

So I implemented the firmware alterations as suggested by @Ackmaniac plus a few more. I was able to do both FOC and BLDC calibrations and spin the motor with both methods! Still trying to figure out the sampling settings in the VESC Tool though. I wanna see those sinusoidal phase currents. 

Thanks @Ackmaniac for the compiled firmware!

Thanks @b264 for the Ubuntu set up instructions! I was able to adjust a couple of more things in the firmware in the VirtualBox.

So the next thing I'll do is get scope shots of the switch nodes. I need to see if there's any bad ringing and voltage spikes. Those spikes will kill the DRV if it's too intense.

So while we wait for me to make more progress, let's discuss preferred connectors for the battery, phase cables, throttle, and hall effect sensors. I will probably ship the test controllers with cables and connectors if enough people agree on the same thing.

For the battery connector I see XT60 or XT90 being commonly used with success. I'll most likely go with these unless someone suggests something better.

For phase cables, I've personally used the [MT60 connectors](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/mt60-3-pole-motor-esc-connector-set-12awg-male-female-2-set.html). They're like a triple connector version of the XT60. You can use up to 12awg wire with them. They look kinda cool and I can ship the other end of the connector as well to be attached to your motor phases. Would the community accept these or prefer something else like bullet connectors?

For the analog throttle and hall effect sensors I was thinking just some generic 3 pin and 5 pin connectors. This would most likely apply more to ebikes since analog throttles and sensored motors do not seem to be as common in the esk8 world.

Let me know what you guys think!

@shaman lot of motors come with a 1.5 6pin jst zh for sensor wires, but most time this wires anyhow to short and people need an adapter cable which is sold here like this 
 https://eskating.eu/product/sensors-adapter-jst-2-0mm-6-pins/

If you have a look at other vesc designs it‚Äôs common to use 2mm jst for CAN port, hall sensor port, uart port and ppm port.

On the focbox the ppm cable was already soldered on the pcb with a connector for rc radio receiver.

Yes of course I intend to release all the design files and BOM! The connector questions is primarily for the test controllers for the test volunteers. I want those set up nice for them. 

But now that you mention it, if I released the design as open source but still sold pre-made ones on the side, does that make me a bad person?

To do both is totally fine. Even to only sell is totally fine. Only difference is that people who support the project mostly only like to support open community projects.

Maybe a really nice and cheap idea would be to sell the boards with the Chip, DRV and maybe USB connector presoldered and preprogrammed (small parts that are hard to solder but easy to do with a reflow oven) and all other parts are added as a kit that can be soldered then by everybody themself. 
This way it's a nice little project and you safe a lot of time when you don't need to place all the small components yourself.

One still has to buy 10 at a time that will total out to $17ish USD. Yes the cost per board is really cheap but you still gotta pay for all 10 and that's not very useful for someone that just wants to build a single controller. I could provide individual boards for much less than $17 USD for those that just want to build one or two.

yeah I totally went with the manual track beefing technique. Check out my thread on the endless sphere. It's got pics of my assembled board!

Yes the 60V limit is due to the DRV8302 indeed. Its max operating voltage as stated by the datasheet is 60V. The DRV8301 used in the VESC 6 has the same limitation. The rest of the control circuitry in the VESC operates off of the 5V or 3.3V votlage rails. Until recently, this was the best TI could do for a "high" voltage motor driver. Now there is the new DRV8353 which can go up to 100V. That's the one I'm using for the high voltage VESC design.

Note that one can design out the DRV entirely and just use individual gate drivers for every set of 2 MOSFETs. A few designers are doing that right now for really high powered VESC based motor controllers.

Thanks, got it! Just to know, which is the price different between let's say DRV8302 to DRV8353? Because you BOM is really low, maybe is possible with the double to make a 100V one. I am not trying to change your plans, it's just out of curiosity.

## \#161 Posted by: shaman Posted at: 2019-01-31T22:15:20.697Z Reads: 177

The price difference is about $0.50 USD in the 1000 unit price. It won't cause the BOM to double in price by any means. Also don't forget that anyone can about 5 free sample of most ICs from TI simply by making an account on TI.com. From a DIY perspective, that keeps the BOM cheap!

Not to bring you down, but just a caveat. Yes 100V is the max but I wouldn't push it that high. Always leave room in the design for transients/spikes so you're not constantly riding the line between working and broken. I am advertising the high voltage design to operate up to 84V(20s).

So I was thinking of switching to a vertical mounted mini USB port. These are through-hole components and should be easy to solder by hand. The orientation would also grant easier access to the USB port while the Cheap FOCer is in an enclosure like the hammond 1590b. The only downside is that LCSC is out of stock on those and idk for how long. I was hoping to be able to pitch a BOM to everyone that is 100% from LCSC.

@shaman can I make 1 request? The canbus implementation on 4.xx hardware doesn't have adequate protection. If 2 vesc are connected, they must be powered on and off at the same time, and cannot be disconnected when they are on.

6.xx hardware, and I think the most recent version of FOCBOX has improved the canbus protections. It would be _great_ if you could cherrypick this improvement. Sorry, I'm not smart enough to have any specific details.

But this issue has fried many vescs. Personally, despite being aware of the issue, I had a xt60 disconnect on a vesc and lost 2 vesc (it's on my todo list to repair).

```
So the VESC 6.4 uses an automotive grade CAN transceiver. It can handle a lot more abuse from transients and such. The CAN transceiver from 4.12 is an older TI transceiver that is lower-class industrial grade.

There is a TI drop-in replacement I can use to replace the old transceiver. It's the TCAN1042-Q1. It's automotive grade as well and should be able to handle the abuse just fine. Note that this will have to be proven as a fix by conducting the procedures mentioned that would kill older VESCs.

I'll change the BOM to use the TCAN1042-Q1. I might be able to also add a spot for a TVS diode on the bus lines that would further help protect the system from spikes.

I'm riding dual vesc 4.12, canbus connected. The xt60 to the battery slipped off on one vesc, and boom, hot canbus chips, no startup. Disconnected canbus, one vesc won't turn on, hot canbus chip. The other turns on with hot canbus chip, worked with split ppm, but stopped turning on a few days later.

the xt60 that slipped off was under zero tension, very surprised. Now I make sure the bananas are tight, or tape or zip tie them together...

You may be able to restore single motor function by removing the CAN transceiver from your broken VESCs. It could be that it's shorted on the inside and drawing too much current from the 3.3V regulator causing the STM to brownout.

An isolated CAN transceiver would be the most robust solution. There is an isolated version of the TCAN1042-Q1 called the ISO1042-Q1. I'm not sure if isolation is truly needed if the VESC 6 doesn't display negative qualities with CAN utilizing a non-isolated transceiver.

Since I can't bail on my mountainboard due to the bindings I figured it would be a good solution.
So I tried deactivating traction control to see if I could live without it before making any changes.
Nope, impossible to ride an MTB on loose terrain without traction control, so CAN bus it is.
However I really like the redundancy of dual receivers for a commuting board.

That's likely due to the fact that the terrain under the other wheel is similar terrain, based on the proximity of the two wheels to each other.  It could be caused by a lower speed, which is a result of the other wheel spinning.  But it is not a direct result of the other wheel spinning.

Direct or indirect is beside the point.
When one wheel starts spinning you rely on the other to propel you forward.
However on low traction situations one wheel simply is not enough and also starts spinning.
Traction control prevents the first wheel from breaking traction by lowering the current that goes to the motor that spins faster.
You don't have to take my word for it. Find a really steep gravel road and do tests with your mtb with and without traction control.

What's happening here, is this some alternate universe? AWG specifies the thickness of a cylindrical wire. It does not vary with respect to use for electrical wiring. As it specifies "thickness" of something cylindrical, it describes a circle, which can be specified by:
- diameter or radius
- circumference
- area

I'm trapped in 'murica units, but I believe the rest of the world uses cross sectional area (mm^2).

This wikipedia page has a table to convert awg to diameter and cross sectional area in both 'murica and SI units.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge

10awg:
- diameter
  - 0.1019 inches
  - 2.588 mm
- area
  - 10.4 kcmil (wtf is this unit...)
  - 5.26 mm^2

(did I misunderstand the discussion and will feel stupid shortly?)

No you're statement is valid. That's why I said approx 2.6mm earlier for the same reasons due to the standard of what AWG is. But no manufacturing process is perfect and there will be variance. Also the stranded stuff probably fluffs out a bit which could throw off a measurement. Either way, 3mm should allow 10awg comfortably.

Did a bit of measurements and observation on the switch node ringing today.

So I tried 0.1uF 1206 100V ceramic cap. I measured all 3 switch nodes with a power supply voltage of 12V. The node closest to where power comes in on the rails peaks at 16V. The node furthest away peaks at 21V. Looks like I've got some inductance issues that increase the further you go. I may try various values of polypropylene caps to see if they improve the situation.

One of the contributing factors is the relatively low gate charge of the FETs I'm using. They're TI CSD18535KCS and they only have a typical total gate charge 63nC vs the 236nC of the FETs from the original 4.12 hardware. Increasing the series gate resistance should help. I will seek a balance between adding caps and increasing series gate resistance. 

For the PCB design, I think I need to go ahead an move the big ground track to underneath the big positive track. I've been advised to to this before and now I think I truly understand why. One will have to beef up those traces in a low profile fashion (like with the copper flat wire) since the exposed power track will sit right beneath the tabs of the FETs after I make this adjustment.

No, you aren't misunderstanding, but that is for one cylinder of solid wire.  When you have one thousand small cylinders (super-stranded) all summing to the same area as the big cylinder, the total wire size increases because it also now contains air as well as conductor.

OK guys. So I've been going hard on this ringing issue. I'm seeing a voltage spike of about 10V above the supply voltage for whatever the supply voltage may be. I've been successful in getting rid of the ringing after the spike but not the initial spike itself.

The next thing I intend to try is a RC snubber circuit placed on the switch nodes. There is a lot of material out there that shows how this helps and how to design it. Testing this out will be the next thing I do in the lab.

Note that I've improved the PCB design in Altium to attack this issue at its source. What I'm doing now is just putting band-aids on my current prototype so I can do some loaded testing without the thing frying. I'll repeat a lot of this analysis on the version that the testers receive so that I verify that issue will have indeed been fixed.

Also, I'll be out on vacation for the next 5 days so progress won't happen until I get back. Cheers!

I don't know exactly what you mean, and I don't know exactly what OP is measuring. My general word of warning regards trying to measure fast rising edges when there are high speed gates and big currents floating around. Everyone who has not worked with this kind of stuff before fails to make this measurement correctly and often end up chasing transients that don't exist for months.

Maybe you know, but is OP measuring Vgs of the FETs? Or maybe phase to ground? The fact that they mention that this spike is also on the power rail, tells me there is a very good chance it is not real.

extremely small probe loop area by either making custom scope probe leads and soldering them to the board, OR worst case using the spring tips instead of the alligator leads. Even the spring tips will be dodgy at these switching currents. Connect alligator GND to probe tip to see the induced currents to see how bad it is.

OP might have a really good measurement setup, worth checking though to not waste time chasing your tail.

I encourage all who question this to read 
[this document](https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/info/docget.jsp?did=59456) and the document I linked before. Parasitic induction **IS** responsible. This ringing is a common occurrence in any application involving H bridges such as DC/DC converters and motor controllers.

From the TI document:

A number of methods have been widely used to minimize the switch node ringing. These methods are listed as follows:
1. Careful PCB layout to minimize the parasitic loop inductance in circuit [1]. 
2. Gate resistor/ Bootstrap resistor to slow down the turn-on of the control FET.
3. RC snubber circuit to attenuate the ringing.
4. Common Source inductance to slow down the turn on of the control FET.

My current prototype has non-ideal layout of the high-current traces causing excessive parasitic inductance. This is what I get for using the cheap Chinese motor controllers as a reference for my layout...

I know there's a lot of EE concepts I'm throwing around. It's not trivial to understand and it takes a bit of reading to wrap you're head around it all. I'll be on
 vacation but I can do my best to answer questions anyone has about all of this.

The bottom board is the underside. There you can see two large exposed traces that run parallel to each other with the switch nodes in between. The trace closest to the edge is positive and the other is negative. Having them spaced apart like this causes a large ground loop that causes parasitic inductance 

The new layout has the positive trace directly over the ground trace by the edge of the board. This reduces the loop area and therefore the parasitic inductance.

I can't provide screen shots of the PCB layers right now as I don't have my laptop with Altium with me right now.

https://www.electro-tech-online.com/threads/mosfet-vds-rating.128972/
http://www.tij.co.jp/jp/lit/ds/symlink/csd18535kcs.pdf

So I found a nice bit of information concerning how MOSFETs behave when they encounter voltage spikes above their rated max Vds. They essentially behave like a zener diode and clamp from drain to source. This event is called Avalanche. The MOSFET can handle the avalanche event for a small amount of time which is specified in the datasheet. Figure 11 in the datasheet I linked shows the avalanche characteristics of the FETs I'm using in my prototype.

The high voltage spike I'm seeing and that I've been battling only lasts for 100 nano-seconds. The avalanche rating suggests the MOSFET can handle this just fine even if the spike is 60V or above. I'm still seeking to squash this spike but it may not be a show stopper if I can't squash it completely.

I don't trust the DRV to tolerate 60V for any amount of time so I'm going to try an age old technique to try and protect it. A good old fashioned RC filter on the supply to the DRV should squash these fast spikes. This will involve a resistor in series with the power line to the DRV and will dissipate a small amount of power. Using a 4.7ohm resistor will cause only 23mW to be dissipated, assuming a supply current of 70mA, which is nothing compared to 250W+ being used by the motor.

Ringing on furthest switch node after adding 4.7uF electrolytic cap by each FET's drain pin and adding the RC snubber.
*the furthest switch node has the worst ringing and is the furthest away from where power and ground leads come in from the battery

Guys I have good news! I've managed to reduce the ringing/spikes to manageable levels. I've added 4.7uF electrolytic caps by each FET as well as an RC snubber to each switch node. Between those two things, I only have a 15.4V spike when supplying the controller with 13.8V. I'm using a 4.7nF WIMA polypropylene cap and a 4.1ohm resistor for the RC snubbers. 

I've added these extra caps and RC snubber to the PCB design for the future version. I suspect that capacitor value will not need to be as large since I'm pretty sure I've reduced the parasitic inductance in the layout/routing. Now I think I can move on to loaded testing!

Also the vesc 6 design has a limit above that (140000 if I remember right ü§î)

There is no easy way to extend the erpm limit?
I personally don‚Äôt see an issue as I use 190kV or lower on 12s, but if your design allows to use up to 20s the kV of the motors would need to go drastically down to not fry the esc.

You can reterminate delta configured motors to a wye configuration. This divides your kV by 1.73. This pretty much forces you to run sensorless though as the hall effect sensors would only be good for the original delta configuration. Most outrunner phases are in delta configuration.

I Motor = 43A

Completed some initial tests at 24V to 27V. The temperature to look at is T FET. The current to look at is **I Motor (Phase amps)**. This is the current that the MOSFETs pass to the motor and therefore cause the heating. The motor was ran at 18% duty cycle in BLDC control mode. Each current limit was tested for at least 3 minutes or until the MOSFET temperature stabilized.The conditions weren't ideal with the controller sitting in still-air with only a relatively small amount of aluminum for heat sinking. Real life conditions will most likely be much better when the controller is in a full aluminum enclosure with wind rushing past it as you ride down the road/sidewalk. Overall this gives me confidence that this controller can handle 40A to 50A continuous for a decent duration when placed in the mentioned ideal conditions. 

Understand that I am testing continuous current limits. This means that you can still deliver higher phase currents to your motor for a short duration such as for accelerating. 

I will do loaded tests at higher voltage levels later this week to see if this can handled the coveted 12s battery.

*Test conducted in 23C ambient temperature. Hotter ambient temps will decrease max continuous current handling capability

How about making it water and air tight, with heatsinks exposed to air flow? At least thats what people do with with heatsinks for their controllers, not all people, but they do it.

I didn't consider that, but a coat of clear spray lacquer on something like that Hammond enclosure should help with corrosion. Something similar could be done to exposed heatsink fins. Maybe even anodizing them could help with corrosion.

Vsupply = 50.4V, 
I Motor = 46A continuous


So I did a test at 50.4V with the motor under load. I picked up spikes of 61.6V under these conditions. Note that I could not use low-induction/low-noise measurement techniques as I did before for this test. I estimate at least 3V are attributed to the non-ideal measurement. Secondly, this is with the bad layout of my prototype. The tester's edition and beyond will have much better layout and probably lower spikes. I will test the newer version of the Cheap FOCer under the same conditions so a side-by-side comparison can be made.

Water tight never works.  Water always gets in eventually.  The secret is making it water-resistant like you said but also making it waterproof so once water gets in, it still works.

Hey guys here's an update on the project. The beta testers are finishing up their payments for their test controllers. Once that happens, I'll order the materials of the controllers and have them shipped to @Martinsp. 

@Martinsp has volunteered to be the assembler of the test controllers. He'll be shipping the controllers to the test volunteers once they are done.

In the mean time, I will be preparing the documentation i.e schematics, gerbers and BOM for my GitHub repository. Once uploaded, it will be dubbed open source and available to all.

So this is my first time coordinating anything like this.

I'd like to offer you guys the option to pitch in any amount of help you wish to offer. Any amount will help me, the test volunteers, and Martin out in making sure this project follows through :slightly_smiling_face:

This is a question for @Martinsp. It looks as if he just used a ton of solder paste, wrapped the copper wires in regular solder wire, and flowed it accordingly. The tension of the solder in a liquid state keeps the wires in place.

Got some slightly bad news. Texas Instruments has changed how they do their sampling. You now have to have a business email and a few other qualifications before being able to get free samples. Kinda sucks for the hobbyists. The BOM will be more expensive for one-off boards now being that you can't practically get free samples anymore.

So I have good news and bad news.

Good news is that the controllers have been made and are functional in FOC and BLDC. Martin spun a 380kV motor with a 10s battery to test these controllers. No eRPM issues!

Bad news is that I messed up the CAN power rail on the PCB. My intent was to have a beefy automotive grade CAN transceiver to help with the issues people experience when using CAN with HW 4.12. I totally missed the fact that the new CAN transceiver needed 5V and not 3.3V. I didn‚Äôt make that adjustment in the PCB design :frowning_face: Martin is currently getting 3.3V CAN transceivers from Europe to put on the controllers so we can at least have functioning CAN for the beta test team

I fixed the PCB design now so that CAN device gets the 5V that it should. This is why I didn't want to release the design before feedback from the beta test experience.

One thing that always bugs me with all vesc derivatives I had are the standard jst connections for sensors, canbus, UART and PPM. They always are prone to coming loose due to vibrations e-skates are facing. I would love to see connectors with a locking mechanism like they are used in automotive applications like these.

Hm, I never had a problem with a JST connector coming loose. I usually have hard time disconnecting them even when I want to. Takes a lot of wiggling. I can't imagine that they would come loose merely due to vibrations.

The nice thing about standard JST is that it's widely available and you can create custom cables easily. I wonder if that would still be possible with these locking connectors and whether you wouldn't have hard time finding exactly the ones that you need.

I guess it would still be possible to deliver the ESCs without any connectors at all and then everyone can solder the on their preferred ones since that's very easy to do.

I've had them come loose, there are better ones and loose ones. People here use hot glue, cable binders etc. to avoid this. In my case everything is attached to the deck and not placed in the enclosure, so gravitation doesn't help.\
I agree and see your point that those ones are not that easily available. I can solder basic stuff, but would rather avoid soldering on pcb's with my basic skillset and tools.

Ok I just uploaded the BOM specific for LCSC. By default it contains enough components for one build and you can upload it to LCSC via their BOM tool. After going through the BOM tool the cart should load up with the components. Note that LCSC is currently out of stock of the CAN transceiver and the DRV8302 . You will have to source the DRV from somewhere else.

Note that BOM has large quantities for the resistors and capacitors. This is because LCSC makes you order most of those at a minimum quantity of 50. I'll upload the traditional BOM soon that reflects exactly what each component is and how many you need.

This is correct. Note that the stock and minimum quantities for the parts on LCSC do change frequently. You very well may find that some parts are out of stock already and need to be subbed out. No worries, just find a replacemnt that has the same spec. A 0805 25V X7R 2.2uF ceramic cap is more or less the same from manufacturer to manufacturer.

Switch Node @Vsupply = 54V 

Ok so I fired up the beta version in the lab. @54V there was only a spike of 55.6V at no-load. This is much better than the prototype and is most likely due to the improved layout.

The owner of the dyno I was using before is currently using it for his own tests. I won't be able to use it for a while. However, I'm sure this version performs better under load as well when it comes to voltage spikes.

12s is only 50.4V max so there is even more headroom for that scenario. That being said, still be cautious using 12s. Some of the beta testers are using 12s and I'll have feedback from them on performance after they're done testing.

I'm running my FSESC 4.12 on 13s (BLDC Mode), even do a full charge to 54.6 now and then..
So far, about 7 months and 400km its running great..

Most of my ebikes run at 14s tough, too bad thats not possible..

You don't need a dyno if you have multiple ESCS, you use one ESC as the load, the other as the driver.

That only works if you've got them hooked up to eachother (on a bench). Riding it with them fighting eachother slightly (or regening your "tested" side) won't give you good data since you have to account for rider weight as well.

You'd be better off doing tests whilst carrying various weights.

The right way to do this is to setup a stationary dyno, using a vesc, that you can manually set the regen wattage to. This way it's easy to simulate exact weights and inclines. Programming an arduino could do this easily since you can just input rider weight, incline, and speed, and it would set the regen wattage appropriately.

Yeah see my ninja edit :grin:

My interpretation of the test explained above me was that you'd just be riding with additional resistance or something.


Realistically, you would need a bigger motor to handle the resistance, or a reduction. That way you can get better low end torque readings, as the back EMF for regen is really low at slow speeds.

Sorry, I should have been more clear. You still use two motors, just connected together with a belt. It's also useful to include a heavy flywheel for more accurate acceleration testing. The very cool thing this allows you to do is calculate your efficiency. I've had this setup on my bench many times.

It also allows you to run very high powers, but with a small battery as the battery only needs to supply the difference between input and output "battery" currents.

This is totally doable with fine solder wire, solder wick, and plenty of flux. The hardest part will be the STM32 and the DRV of which both have 0.5mm pitch leads. That's where the solder wick comes in to soak up excess solder and eliminate solder bridges.

@shaman If one was to assemble the FOCer "by hand", is it possible to do some sanity checks as you progress? I mean, it kind of sucks if you spend 4 hours soldering all the components, then you try to turn it on and... it doesn't work... or worse, you get the famous magic smoke. Is it somehow possible to solder on only a few parts; check that it's done correctly; then solder on more parts, etc?

It's hard to do functional checks as you go. The best is to do visual checks as you go and give close attention to the 0.5mm pitch parts under a microscope or magnifying glass. All the other components are relatively easy. 

You can do continuity checks with a multi-meter before powering up to make sure things have continuity where they should and don't have it where they shouldn't. One check would be for continuity from Vsupply to Ground before powering up. This can identify that a short to ground exists before powering up. You can do the same for the 5V and 3.3V rails.

I would also use a current-limited power supply if possible for the first power on. You can limit it to 100mA since the controller should only be drawing around 40mA in standby. This would then limit current if there is a short somewhere and hopefully prevent catastrophic damage.

Have spare STM32s or DRVs handy just in case they get burned up.

I know its a little daunting to try and hand solder something like this for the first time. But once you do, the feeling of success is awesome!

On the vesc boards I've assembled my checklist before powering on involves:

Supply rail shorts to ground

Mosfet drain source shorts

Mosfet gate source shorts

Look for cold solder joints on the gate driver outputs.

Reason for the gate output check is that I've found a floating gate trace can result in false mosfet switching events. Which means shoot through fault.

On the a200s 18 fet boards I've been making I also check gate capacitance to make sure all mosfets are actually connected.

And of course for first power up use a current limited supply at low voltage, not battery.

I wonder why not make a via over *almost* the entire bottom pad.  If you need to remove heat from the pad, just flow solder over it.

At least then it's much easier to solder and desolder with rudimentary tools.

Well you're not wrong. Generally the technique of adding several small vias for thermal management is to facilitate easier reflowing in manufacturing. But being that this is for the DIY community, adding a large through hole pad underneath would most likely do the trick. I'll add this to the list of changes to be conducted for the full release of this controller. Keep up the good suggestions!

I've been meaning to show this for a while but I haven't had the time. The way I had in mind was to couple an aluminum bar to the MOSFETs and then attach that bar to the inner wall of the enclosure. One can simply drill some of the MOSFET mounting holes through the aluminum bar and the enclosure wall and just use longer screws to mount it all together. I hope that makes sense. I need actually do it and show pictures sometime soon...

The cables are intended to come out through the sides through cable glands like these.

For good water resistance you will also need to get the gaskets and rubber O-rings that fit the 1590b enclosure. Rubber washers can be used on the outside screws as well.

The aluminum bar needs to be 6mm thick. It can be a bit thicker but not too much.

You can use that hole by the capacitor if you want but I don't think it's necessary if you mount it in the way I have said.

For all the passive components, it doesn't matter. The replacements just need to have the same attributes. Yes there can be a significant price difference for some reason. However in my experience, a 1K, 0805, 1% resistor does not vary much from manufacturer to manufacturer. Same for ceramic caps.

Will the CAN module still work with 3.3V or do i have to cut the trace and solder a jumper wire?

When did you get the Gerbers from the GitHub? The current Gerber files have the CAN issue fixed and the CAN transceiver is powered from 5V

Only the CAN issue has been fixed for the Gerbers in the GitHub. The rest will be fixed after I'm done receiving feedback from the beta testers

Suits me, the can bus is the most important. I wont use the servo port and if i would its an easy fix.

Do you have any updates on motor amp capabilities?

@janpom used a motor current limit of 60amps and the controller didn't get over 50C while putting it through some serious hills. That's just with an aluminum bar as a heatsink with no airflow.
