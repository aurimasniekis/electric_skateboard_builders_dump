Replacing my old 10s2p lipo setup with a 10s3p li ion pack. Do I need to change any settings on my vesc to avoid frying it? Btw, my new pack has a bms if that's relevant to the situation. The new pack is a bit bigger but I don't think that should matter

If you stay the same voltage than no.
But you could 
Depends on your battery min and max values you had before.
As your new pack now can handle more amps.
(Just be sure donâ€™t set it over the max current your bms or vesc can handle ðŸ˜…)
