Thanks. I couldnt find that. So what one do I leave out. It doesnt say on that post. The TEMP one?
So based on that info, am I presuming that 

5v    = RED
TEMP  = BLACK
hall1   = GREEN
hall2  = BLUE
hall3  = WHITE
GND = YELLOW

in this APS motor?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/8/b836d77d08a6b6e2a6f5c2f89457fe6a1d7e93e6.png" width="532" height="500">

For temp , but most motors don't actually have a temp sensor so the wire doesn't go anywhere and it's not needed for sensors to work

Also it would help to have a picture of the actual connector coming from the motor and not just the wires to confirm ðŸ˜‰
