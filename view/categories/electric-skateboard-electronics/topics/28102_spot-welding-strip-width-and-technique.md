I'm building a dual 6374 street carver and I'm trying to find somewhere in the US that has the correct pure nickel strips for spot welding. My pack will be 12s4p. Will 8mm be wide enough or will 10mm be a minimum. If anyone could let me know of something in the states that would be great. Otherwise I guess I'll just have to wait to order from China. Also have a couple other questions. 

1) I see that 12 gauge is used alot within the packs. For the serial connections is this ideal gauge?

2) PVC shrink-wrap dimensions for 1s4p bundle? Anyone have a suggestion here on what I need to get. 

Thanks!
