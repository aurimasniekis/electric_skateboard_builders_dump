Hi, as everyone knows, LiPo can be quite dangerous when not handled correctly.
People usually don't care that much about the safety until it comes to a disaster.
I have found a video showing different ways of storing all kinds of LiPo batteries during charge.
Some are better, others are extremely dangerous.
I just want to share this video with you guys.

This is what happens when you overcharge your batteries.
This can happen quite easily when using cheap-ass low-quality charger.

Safety should be no. 1 on your list. ALWAYS.
