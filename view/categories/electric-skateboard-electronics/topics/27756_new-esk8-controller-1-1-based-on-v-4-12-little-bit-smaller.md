```
Our modified V 4.12 is finally finished!

We were inspired by Chacka
And have thought that we should follow his way
There are still a few other components added
But I list that later.
We would appreciate your opinion

So if i understand,

This Controller will solve the problem of overheating / Thanks to Direct Fets and the allu case.
It will also solve the probleme of unexpected Boost when Duty cycle Drop since 0.85 to 0.95 cause the current is mesured on all phases.

So it's a great improve compare to the 4.12 version.

May I right ?

It looks really nice! Great work. Only complaint is I want the USB to point upwards. 

What's the reason for the large caps being two different types / sizes?

[/quote]

Caps offer different frequency behaviour according to their capacity. Caps with more capacity can not provide power instantly/ as fast as it would be needed, caps with smaller capacity can. By taking different sizes caps in parallel you are usually well prepared for fast load changes and prevent undervoltage errors.

Thanks for your consideration
For a group buy.
Unfortunately I have to tell you,
That we have only used the best material
What it gives to the market
We also produce everything in Germany
Unfortunately, the producing cost is very high
We have only produced 100 pieces
Which is also unpopular for the price too
Only the housing cost us in production 50.- â‚¬
At the price of 199.- â‚¬ we do not even have 10%
But we donate ourselves from this Money BV too.
Of the little money that keeps us
We wanted to show with this controller
What you can build so beautiful when you want!
But we are trying to produce a larger quantity
To bring the price down
So that we can go a little bit down with the price.
We will also produce a low budget controller
Only with heat sink and heat shrink tubing
This could make the price around 25-30 â‚¬ cheaper
For this, we have to test first whether it is because of the heat.
And the USB and PPM cable was in the front from the case,
for better connecting.
Al the other Producer build the USB and the Ppm on Top,
what unfortunately was for the connections.
By this Controller you done must break the cables.

Regards Attila

Thank you for the compliment,
But I have not done this al alone.
Which I also could not can make
But some customers from me were  friendÂ´s
And these friends have helped me
Which put the NEW ESK8 Controller 1.1 on the legs

 I was at the weekend in Hohenstaufen, at the German Downhill Championships, it was a mega fun. There was also a Uphill race between the semi-final and the final race. The people were very enthusiastic and a lot of questions were asked. Evolve was also there and has two boards available for the race. Once the new GTX and a GT, the GTX has just come to half. The GT is about 15 sec. Later on like my two boards. Afterwards, we measured the times with how much the Evolve have climbed the mountain. The top speed was at a good 20Kmh. With 100% rechargeable battery and the 1.5Km up. At the top the batteries were still at 62% after 1,5Km. We then tested it with my boards. My Bustin boards have reached a maximum speed of 39.5Kmh, started with 96% battery and above the battery was still 90%. Then we tried it with my MTB and it even went with 40.2Kmh.
Al Board have a great performance and working fine.
The organizer would like next year
To the downhill also make an electro Uphill race.
It is very close to France, Austria and Schweitz.

Just received the esk8 1.1 controllers for my eMTB. Wow, looks like a masterpiece, nice and sturdy! Very well done @esk8, can't wait to test them :yum: 

I'm also surprised because of the size, the controllers look bigger on pics. So here a comparison with the standard V4.12.

and on the side where was the cable only 16mm.
So i think we have build wit the ESK8 1.1 the smallest housing.

Looks sweet as bro! :sunglasses: 
How many cells in series & motor amps are you recommending this for?

edit: found it bro

**Summary:**
8V â€“ 60V ( 3s to **12s** LiPo) max. 60.000 ERPM
**50A continuous** current, up to 240A (for some seconds)
FOC (Field Oriented Control) with automated motor detection via USB and BLDC-Tool, IMPORTANT: FOC is still in development, please be carful! Implementation of FOC only on you own responsibility and risk.
Integrated BEC 5V 1A output for external electronics (converter integrated)
Size: ca. 72mm x 68mm x 19mm
Current and volt measurement on all phases
Regenerative breaking
Sensored and sensorless operation
User interface for Windows, OSX and Linux
Updates through USB connection via BLDC-Tool SW
no passive or active cooling required (depends of course on your usage)

Because the ESK8 1.1 controller is based on the V4.12
I have also adopted the values. precaution.
I can not say exactly how the Vesc6 and the FOCBox
are different.
For all three, the direct fets are used.
But I have not been on the FOCBox and on the Vesc6
The TDK capacitors SMD2220 with 15uF / 100v
Also the caps are with FOCBox and Vesc6 2x 680yF / 63V
The SMD 1206 is installed with the FOCBox
But I do not know whether 10uF / 50V or 4.7uF / 100V
And there are 9 pieces on the FOCBox.
We use 14 pieces SMD1206 with 4.7uF / 100V.
And the caps we have used 1 x 680yF / 63V and 1 x 1600yF / 63V
This reduces the current fluctuations to the minimum
Vesc6 have 3x shunt
FOCBox 2x
ESK8 1.1 2x

Everything else can only be answered by the BOM list.
Regarding the components where the difference is

Hi,
whats actually the reason for using two antispark.
Would one for both VESCS (ah sorry ESK8 Controllers) get too hot ?
and whats your experience with the 40A Car Fuses do they handle high Current bursts well ?

Does anyone know where the UART TX and RX Pins are on this one? Couldn't find them on mine through trial and error :smile:

[quote="notger, post:52, topic:27756"]
whats actually the reason for using two antispark.
[/quote]

It seems that the esk8 controller 1.1 can deliver more power than the regular V4.12. So if you have dual system and ride uphill with full throttle the 40A fuse will blow (after 10 sec. receiving 60A). It's possible to solder a bigger fuse to the antispark but maybe it gets the bottleneck in the end that's why I'll use 2 antispark switches as well, the on/off switch is connected to both PCB's in parallel. 

I have another question @esk8, I can't find info about the assignment of PPM pins. Where is (-), (+) and (s) located? Or just show a picture with connected servo wire, thanks!

When you looking in front of the 3Pin the GND/black was on the right side and the White
comes beside the USB

@esk8

I bought two. Is there a pinout chart available somewhere? I do not want to connect things in reverse :P
Canbus should be easy enough (just take the two middle pins), however receiver/ppm could be tricky.

@esk8

I received my two units today. Sadly, one (or several) wires are soldered incorrectly. 
The + wire simply came loose after test fitting the unit, which required slightly bending the power wires. By judging how easily this one came loose, I doubt I should trust the solder job of the other wires...

https://youtu.be/EfQ-x-zKLwo
 
Does anybody know if these cases can be opened without causing damage?
I am seriously not in the mood for a return shipping for something that I can easily fix myself.

P.S. Never in my life have I been able to remove a properly soldered 12AWG wire...Even with an FPV race drone flying 120 km/h into the ground with the lipo being flung forward.

Sorry for this  and this was for me very unpleasantness!
You can send me back and i refund your the shipping cost.
Tell me please in PM you order Number that i know
the adresses where i must sending the new controller.
I have not enough controlling my solder work.
I al time controlling al soldering work.
but there is that I do a probably a fault.

Attila very quickly provided me with the info needed to fix the issue. I opened up the case and soldered the wire in place. Please note that if you do this without esk8.de's approval, you will void your warranty.

P.S. The PCB looks great. Very tidy, components all straight. The other wires were soldered correctly. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a high quality VESC.

Having issues setting two up via CANBUS.
When enabling can FWD in the upper right corner using the correct ID for the slave (2), I get ''**no firmware response**''
and only one motor responds to the Tx.

Both VESCs are connected to an anti-spark plug with an Y cable/single xt-60 connector. 

The CANBUS cable is OK. Each individual ESC can be read/motors run.
CANBUS connection does not work.

Any ideas?

Hey, I'm sure this will solve your problem:

ON THE SLAVE:
Read configuration
Set Controller ID to 1
In the app configuration **disable** "Multiple ESC's over CAN"!!! (enabled on master only)
"Send status over CAN" is already enabled.
Write configuration and reboot.

ON THE MASTER:
Read configuration
Set Controller ID to 0
"Multiple ESC's over CAN" is already enabled.
Write configuration and reboot.
```

Thanks, but sadly that does not resolve the issue.
Those were the settings I tried first (I followed this tutorial http://www.lp-electronic.com/vesc/connect-two-vesc-via-can-bus/)/tried it again just now.

Same issue as before.

@esk8 Did you split + and - wires at one edge of the board each ?
Regarding a old video of Vedder, as far as I understand this is not a good idea in matter of capacitance
https://youtu.be/x6lPdI9OVQg?t=12m58s

I don't know what is the real impact on the electronics, but could be more reliable to keep them close to each other, right ?

I am looking in the settings by youtube but i don't find
it that i Kan make the P higher.
And i loaded the original vide by youtube down.
I must looking thats i loaded the Vide from the SD Card.
I hope than was it better.

If I understand you correct, you are asking if he has the plus cable on the TOP side of the PCB and the minus cable on the BOTTOM?
Yes he is doing that, you can see that on the first and second pic in this thread.
I dont know if there is copper on the PCB where the cables are going. but if so, it is probably a groundplane which is the same as the minus cable. 
nether the less the 2 cables are running parallel (only separated by the PCB (probably 1,6mm thick)) to the solderpads.
Therefore it isn't a problem in my mind.

and what you are asking for is the inductivity, not the capacity, as Ben mentioned in his video

No, I meant that he put a red wire (assuming + one) on one edge (toes side) of his Mountainboard from electronics to battery box and black one on heels side.
You're right, it's inductivity.

Is it safe to run 12S on these, without adding additional caps?

*149KV

I already know I won't hit the ERPM limit with my setup.

Unfortunately, I have no engine
what goes to 12S
But I'm sure you're using the system
can also drive with 12S
It would be very interesting to know how well
it works with 12S

But i came by 12S SK3 6374 149KV motor by 12S/50,4V over 60.000 ERPM. (67.586)
Ore i have a calculation error ?

ok, a little over the ERPM limit..but I currently never push full throttle.
30 km/h is scary enough offroad here. Just looking for more power to go up hill.

Using 2x5000mah 6S 60C, I can set each VESC to 50A (maybe 40 to stay on the safe side, currently it is set to 25).

How much amps can I pull MAX using a single ESK8 anti-spark switch for both VESC? I already removed the fuse and bridged the two pads with 12AWG wire.
