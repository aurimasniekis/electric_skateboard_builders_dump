Is this what I need to replace my burnt out DRV8302?

https://www.ebay.com/itm/391752389280

Is that a legit source?

Mouser or digikey in my region doesn't have any in stock.

5 DRV8302s for $16 is a good deal, but it's always questionable if the seller does package them correctly for shipment considering they are from China.

That's what I was thinking. Guess I'll just have to try it and see what happens.

@b264 Yeah it's the first place I checked. No stock. I haven't done something like this before but I've been studying and replaying @JohnnyMeduse videos over and over again and then some image training. Wish me luck!

@ARetardedPillow Exactly!

It is not this easy, there like a shortage of DRV8302 from the most trustworthy supplier. ( I don't really trust chinese supplier for vital part like this)

I didn't realise there was a shortage.  I got some a few months ago no problem.  I think I still have one left
