Hi! Are those 4mm bullet connectors on sk3 motors are o.k. or i need to resolder them to 5,5mm ones?

I use them .... Not as heavy duty at the 5.5mm. 4mm def more likey to disconnect if they are pulled

Work fine.  I usually swap to 4mm on my VESC's since most motors are 4mm.  Easier than messing with the motor wires.  On my R-Spec motors - i'll swap to the 5.5mm on VESC similarly instead of cutting the wires and putting 4mm on.

Securing them w/ some heat shrink or tape is always a good idea.

I had same issue with 4mm banana connectors. They kept trying to come apart. If you use them, I'd recommend covering the connection with shrink tube. 
I wound up switching to 5.5 mm bullets. Solid connection and possibly less  electrical resistance.

I don't know if it just me, but I had a very hard time soldering 4 mm bullets to 12 AWG wires, because the wires are big and the bullets are small. What I eventually end up doing is removing some of the wire strands. soldering 5.5 bullets will be much easier for me.

They were the motor phase wires of the VESC. Maybe I don't know how to put things into stuff.
