On hobbyking I see that there is a harness for connecting 2 batteries in series. I need to connect 3 in series to make a 9S battery but I can't find a three battery harness on any site. Any other options? Could I somehow rig up a system by using several harnesses and cutting the extra wires? 

Also, I found some tutorials on youtube on how to make a custom 3 battery harness that require a lot of soddering and drilling. If possible, I would like to use parts off of hobbyking or some other online supplier. 

Thanks!
