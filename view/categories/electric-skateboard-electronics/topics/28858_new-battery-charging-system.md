Hi! 

After a few weeks with my first diy electric longboard, I realized how inconvenient charging my batteries was. I was wondering if there is an easier way to charge batteries while they are in the board.

I have 3 3s 5000 mah 20c lipo batteries connected in series.

Thank you in advance!

Use a 9/10s bms to balance charge your cells. I use bestech myself.

Take your pick. Keep the discharge current in mind. HCX-223V1 is popular.

Sorry but I don't feel comfortable recommending you anything with the provided information. I can tell you that HCX-D223V1 is popular choice around here but other than that it's all up to you. 

If you're a newb, plan your board first, pick your parts, consider whether they will work together, take a look at the existing builds and read, read & read these forums, there is plenty of useful information if you're willing to do research.
