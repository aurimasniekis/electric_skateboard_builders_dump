Curious, I keep reading about anti-spark switches, etc... If I'm using a li-ion battery pack, can I simply use something like this:

It's a basic power switch...

A very large spark will still he created inside the switch, wearing it away and still potentially frying your electronics.

the specs for that switch don't even tell what voltage or current it can handle.
but judging from its size I would guess 12v  3a

Vedder anti spark or similar, or an XT90S.

Nope! Only up to 6s. Anything higher and it will burn out instantly.
