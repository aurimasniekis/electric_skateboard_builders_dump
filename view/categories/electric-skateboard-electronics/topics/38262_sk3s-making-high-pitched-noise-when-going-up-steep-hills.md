Wondering if anyone has had experience with their motors starting to make a high pitched noise when they go up steep hills? I swear they haven't always done this, and it seems that my board has lost a tiny bit of power that is only noticeable on steep hills as well. Just want to see if I can trouble shoot it to see what I might be in for replacing in the future.

Video would be nice. Otherwise i can only imagine motor is struggling and it starts to "whine" make a sound where it has difficulty going faster or keep the pace.


High pitch sound - sounds more like related with esc to me
