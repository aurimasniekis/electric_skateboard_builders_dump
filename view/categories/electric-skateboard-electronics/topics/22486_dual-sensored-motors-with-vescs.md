I have a dual Torqueboards setup. With one motor, everything is perfectly fine. But with the other, I get Hall Detection Failed unless I have the motor hooked up to run backwards. Since it doesn't look like you can change motor direction with BLDC, does anyone have a way around this?

Pretty sure the motor is defective. I had the exact same issue with one of @JLabs motors. Hall detection would fail 1 way but not the other. We ended up swapping it out and now everything's good. I believe his motors are similar to torqueboards (same MFG)
