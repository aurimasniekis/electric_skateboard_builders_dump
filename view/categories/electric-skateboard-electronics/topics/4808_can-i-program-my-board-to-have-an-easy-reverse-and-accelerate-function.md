Much like Boosted, can I have my board go  backwards and forwards seamlessly, on like a wheel trigger type remote? If so how, what programs and hardware do I need to do this? Thanks.

I think that's more of of a 'how your receiver/transmitter works' over programming. 
Just fine a receiver transmitter combo that has a wheel

on vescs, i would recommend a nunchuck remote for that, as there is a function implemented already(reverse on z button).
If you want to use another remote i recommend simply setting the braking in the PPM tab on current control with reverse(or sth like that) instead of current control no reverse.
