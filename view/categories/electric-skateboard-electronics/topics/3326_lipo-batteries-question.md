Hey guys, Im new to the forum and new to the eboard world. I was looking to buy some lipos, originally I was going to buy (2) 6s 5000mah 30c, but they are sold out on hobbyking, so I was looking more and found ones that are 20-30c, what does mean? Whats the difference?

Also, how do you delete a topic?

That is the discharge rate, if you plan to use them in parallel the C's will sum up so you'll get 40C (20x2) constant current and 60C of burst current, that's why there are two values, 20 and 30, the first is the normal discharge rate, the other is the burst discharge.
