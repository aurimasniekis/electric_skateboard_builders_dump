Hello :slight_smile:
This is my first build. I've ordered some part from a Chinese manufacturer.  I can't figure out how to connect my receiver to this esc  What kind of wiring would you recommend? Do I need a voltage regulator in between?

I might be wrong but the connector in the image looks like the motor sensor connector. The Chinese esc I got had a built in receiver and you just had to bind the remote and the control board together.

Didn't cross my mind. You are correct! The receiver is built in.
