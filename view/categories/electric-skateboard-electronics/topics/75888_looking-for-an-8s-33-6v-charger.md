Hey ! 

Anyone have an idea where i can find one 8S /33.6V charger for my bms ? 

I’m in France and shipping from like aliexpress or Banggood is veryyy long, DiyElectricSkateboars are selling some for 6S and 9S, but no 8S ...

Thanks !

I can help you (from Spain) but i will ask you what i paid for It+shippings.
It's black friday....i recommend you to buy It from Aliexpress and wait for It.

Thank you for your help ! 
I found this one on Amazon , https://www.amazon.fr/gp/aw/d/B06W565W7W/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?smid=A3A3Q7UOQPK8JL&psc=1

Does it sound good to you for a 8S Lipo battery ? 
I never found elsewhere something like this « 3 phases 28,8 V and 29,6 V, what does it mean ?

Let me check on aliexpress, but the shipping will still be as long or longer than amazon ...!

Yo, I got a 8S 33v 6A at home. I'm in France too. Looking to maybe upgrade to 12S so I'm considering to sell it or not (still thinking). 

What is your budget?

My Bms is made for 4Amps, will not be damaged with 6A?

Ah no my charger is too powerful, it will damage your BMS I think! Maybe you can order one, if I find the name of my provider I will post here (quick shipping and nice contact)
