Even a review of the Maytechs without comparison would be great!

I believe @ralphy is selling Jacob's hub motors and has fixed the slipping urethane issue.

I'll have a comparison in a couple weeks, we're experimenting with maytechs new motors since they sent them for free.

Although I have 3 sets of Jacobs motors I don't sell them . I use them to develop the more robust urethane design the community has requested . I will sell exclusively the wheel and hardware you need to turn Jacobs hubs into an extreme motor at 100mm diameter capable of taking on many adverse road and off road conditions for extended periods of continuous operation. I can bet money the Maytechs will not outperform Jacobs hubs with the 100mm urethane I'm developing in any way.

That's cool no problem. The new urethane is not for everyone. Try something local.

Just wanted to show a ride without full battery.    Hubs do get warm up hills and high speed kills the battery.    overall Ive been having a blast

The Maytech are rated at 600w, the Jacobs at 1500w continuous. That explains why the Jacobs run cooler and more efficient at higher speeds.
