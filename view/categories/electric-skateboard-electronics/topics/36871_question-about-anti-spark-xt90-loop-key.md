Was wondering if anyone has a premade loop key for sale that I can use with xt90 male on vesc and xt90 female on batteries.

Just search this thread :) there are some quite nice diagrames with anti sparks :)

The last link is exactly same as your build, except 3s batteries instead of 6s...

Inside the shrink tube they solder the bottom part of both xt60s together with just the soldering stuff and the top parts with black and red wire leading to the connector for the vesc.

You cut it, the whole circuit mustnt be closed/complete when the eboard is off...

Yep it is possible, but I do not know how it looks inside of these harnesses, it might not fit the XT90 soldering tabs...

Red is positive...

Yep...you solder the wire going from the battery to one pole of the XT90 connector and the wire going from the ESC to the second pole of the XT90...then you have the XT90-S plug where you use just one wire and solder him just like that he connects both poles (make a loop)...when you plug in the XT90-S connector, the capacitor inside of it (is it capacitor? I am not sure, maybe rezistor, does not matter, works anyway) takes the burst current that could possible dmg your ESC, as you plug it all the way in the circuit is completed and the current can go through the ESC without dmging it :)

+ (plus) from the battery, - from the battery :) But it should not really matter :) the main thing, that there is the capacitor between them :) 

No problem, feel free to ask if you need help :) To make sure you dont dmg anything post the pic of your build before you make your first test and somone will tell you if everything is soldered correctly :) Do not forgot to isolate everything correctly :)

So It doesn‚Äôt matter if the side of the capacitor says + or -. The 2 halves of wires can go on either side?

If you buy an anti-spark XT-90s you dont need a resistor, just solder the wire and ends on.  You put the XT-90s in the middle of the positive circuit.  Look at the Beautiful Diagrams thread, there are a few XT-90s diagrams...

THat is a cutout from the entire schematic which look like this, so you have a better idea of what it should like like as part f the entire electronics structure.

Heat shrink the ends, and make sure your using an iron that really hit so you get a good flow.  Also a helping hand will make like a lot easier, just Google helping hands soldering stand.

dude cmon...  if you don‚Äôt even know the purpose of electrical tape you shouldn‚Äôt be building a board.  please dude, it‚Äôs not because i hate you or anything, you just gotta get the basics down before attempting to build something as complicated as a board.

practice your soldering skills, read, read and read
