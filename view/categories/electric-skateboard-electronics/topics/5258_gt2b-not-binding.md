make sure your throttle trim is centered. I had a problem with that a while back, every time I turned the board on it would either put the esc into program mode or require me to set the throttle range. I can't find center anymore, so I always have to set my throttle range. It's annoying, but it works.

Has such a problem ever occured to anyone else in the meantime?
I have just lost 2 gt2bs for basically no reason. 10 sec ago it would go into bind mode just fine but then randomly not anymore. Any ideas on what to do? Already checked the throttle range.

I have the problem on a GT2B
but when I cut the board to fit my custom enclosure, I damaged the C6 capacitor on the bottom left of the PCB
I dont know if it's related to my bind problem.

I will try to move the trigger center rotary button to check if that works

I've got the exact same problem. I've cut and filed the PCB here and there to fit it into a custom enclosure (without damaging SMDs tho) and it did bind all the fine yesterday, and suddenly today the green light stopped going into blinking mode when it turn the transmitter with the binding button pressed. Anyone managed to solve this? The Internets seem eerily silent on this issue :/
