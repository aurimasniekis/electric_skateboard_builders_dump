Hi fellas

I know this is not an esk8 question.......just after some general electronics advice on replacing a bms on an e-bike battery. 

I have not previously soldered a live battery pack before hence the question.

Basically I want to desolder the existing bms unit and re-solder on the new replacement. 

I will take care by covering desoldered wires in electrical tape to prevent shorting them out. Is there a particular order I should use when I desolder/ re-solder the wiring?

Unplug the balance connector and then desolder the main leads.
When you solder the new one, Solder the Main leads and then plug in the balance

Exactly this and make sure the balance leads go back the right way around
