if these are the same as the standard clone flywheels then the ride will suck it may get rid of water but from experience these are too hard ... nice to see harfang on them (just a pity they are not a little better before the cut)

I cut a very similar tread into 90mm clones... it made them more prone to chunking and made only a marginal improvement to wet grip.

When you look close it's actually better executed than on the Boa wheels, no sharp corners and edges that can chip. "One chamfer a day, keeps the chipping away"

From the pictures it looks like the core is not offset. With this wider contact patch it means our pulleys won't fit this wheel.

Treads are just a small fraction of a wheel's ability to grip in the rain. If the thane is trash, then the wheel is going to be useless with or without treads.

If ya'll ask me, most of the wheels we currently have are trash for rain skating. There's way better thane out there that does the job better, but most people aren't willing to venture outside of kegel and flywheel core wheels.

Good rain wheels are RAD Advantages in 78A, Seismic Alpha Blackops, and Seismic Speedvents, Seismic Hot Spots Blackops off the top of my head. All sets are easily grooved to improve traction in the rain. Anything high rebound like Boas is going to fuck you in the rain.

Speedvents are okay. Their DEFCON formula isn’t as grippy as the Blackops formula. In that respect, I prefer Alpha Blackops.

Even then, there’s no “best” wheel, because everybody’s definition of a perfect wheel is going to differ.

are good, they wont last.

Just like any wheel on a car, they will run out of thread and be unusable for _rain_ again. what they need to make is a deeply cut one, or a good and _lightweight_ AT wheel that has switchable, standard thread imo

The person who had little genuine interest in making their production board waterproof and thinking avoiding water was the answer -- now is talking about the best rain wheels.  Okay. :man_shrugging:

I agree that these are not the best option but at least they're replaceable. They weight a pound each though. 
The only problem with the latest D-Drive motors is that that either have Kegel or Abec wheel types.

That was literally me talking about the difference discerning between waterproof and water resistance. Notice the parentheses?

Now here are screen caps of me using “waterproof” in place of “water resistance”

Edit: I should note this is **every** screen cap of that word dating back to 2017. No crops no clips.

In that screenshot, I said quote:
`I’m already making the precautions to make the electronics and battery enclosure entirely weather resistant`


I suppose because I wanted to point out that nothing is truly “waterproof” and that everything is actually “water resistant”, that makes me a harsh opponent of “waterproof” esk8s.

If you look at what I said above before you changed it

[quote="b264, post:38, topic:74558"]

[/quote]

Then you'll see I am right.  You had little *genuine* interest in making your production board waterproof.  You wanted to do the standard pretend-we-care add some water-resistance stuff and drop it.

Things can definitely be waterproof, beyond water-resistant, but you had no interest in pursuing that.  That's what you're showing now and what I was referring to.

Don't change my words around LoLz.

I've sent you an invoice for the research.

What? I make the board water resistant to the best of the CF design’s capability, halted production and chose different “waterproof” hub motors (on my dime), and employed the use of PG7 waterglands to make this board as water resistant as possible. It was made for a niche market that wanted a commute tool that wouldn’t instantly die from wet salted roads, in which it succeeded in accomplishing that task. Now you have the audacity to say that I didn’t really care? Okay.
