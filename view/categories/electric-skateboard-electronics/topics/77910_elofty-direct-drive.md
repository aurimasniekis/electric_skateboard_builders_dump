[Well They're here on the forums](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wiki-a-beginner-guide-to-diy-an-esk8/46844/128?u=jc06505n) and we might as well talk about them. They were mentioned briefly on the [Raptor 2 hub or TB Direct Drive(DD) or SwissBoards DD](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/raptor-2-hub-or-tb-direct-drive-dd-or-swissboards-dd/75980/349?u=jc06505n) Thread.

It depends on the quantity that you buy.

if you buy 1, its 499, if you buy 100, it's 360 per unit.

it's been known the performance of a hub motor for eskates is less compared to the motor's can spinning in free air. Regardless of how other companies do their "DD" design, the wheel is an insulator. Makes it hard disperse heat especially when there are no holes like the SK3 motors. It's not bad the motor is fully encased. It's just harder to transfer heat .

They advertise the motor to be rated at 75A@50V. So that makes it 3750 Watts, the wires are pretty thin though. Standard waterproof connector commonly seen these days.

@b264 is correct it hold the motor on the axel.. Jerrys torque drive (exp drives) mount the exact same way. that was one of the many excuses for six months.there is pictures here in one of threads of him posting using a nut to hold the motors on having a threaded nut to hold the motor for easy replacing he said..

magnets aren’t rated to that temp

https://www.kjmagnetics.com/specs.asp



 the stator obviously is smaller and still unknown length.

  The true electrical phase resistance and the true kv should tell a lot and plus the temp ability of the magnets and you know everything anout the motor performance other then how well it dissipates heat.

It appears that they won't provide ABEC adapters (even if shown in a picture).

Brother, I feel your pain.

I'm the other buyer mentioned above, and the information relay was likewise a frustrating experience. I had the same sort of exchanges, where I tried to find out which adaptor came with it, offered to buy both ABEC and Kegel versions if possible (never got a clear answer), ordered the ESC-side connectors (told they would ship together but they shipped seperately), and tried in vain to inform them that showing ABEC adaptors in the first photo is misleading.

Even though the information provided was never clear or entirely helpful, the seller always replied quickly (same time zone) and gave what appeared to be their best effort.

I will likely receive mine first, so will report back on what I get. I will also, as mishrasubhransu thought likely, be reviewing them for .

For science! (And also because I'm a filthy little cheapskate.)

![15517907143700|690x265](upload://v06gyM9MMCK8Fp3BWYKEGsYf2wB.jpeg)

It is bigger than the standard track width. I think that it is as wide as Evolve track.

![15517926369683|666x500](upload://mH933zUAfETWd4MoQqNbPGahK21.jpeg) 

Axle shaft is a bit long.

![15517926251482|375x500](upload://aXcL4l5qQExFx0G4kQM9tjbrS0.jpeg)

That I can answer my friend. 

Drivetrains (hubs or outrunners) on boards that go for $899 have a fairly standard price point across the industry. 

These drives, and completes, I would expect, to cost $99 more, so $399. 

Make no mistake; they’re going to get Axial right, and, we’re going to see a lot of Exway-type decks with all three drivetrain choices (there’s a drop-through one that looks like an Exway has a baby with a Carbon). 

and to be clear and never start rumors, I am not bound by NDA to Exway nor do I know anyone at Exway.  

After talking it over with a friend, I think that’s a factory second (axle length) yet this is purely conjecture on our part. 

The sample above does look like it was assembled by a third-party, again just conjecture (my own) but if the parts don’t meet tolerance Chinese factories don’t throw things away. Everything is for sale in China, with the right level of connections. 

If I had one, I would most definitely rebuild it, I like that axle. Good luck friends, stoked to see this so early.

But according to topcloud these are going to be pretty popular so I guess you can claim how you rode them before they were cool. :p

Guys, toss away the tissues, put the lotion back on the nightstand and drop your tadgers.

The eLofty DD is legit!

Just came back from my first outing using the notoriously shitty diyeboard ESC (lost all my vescs in two days...doh!), and I'm honestly a bit blown away. The power comes on in a smooth and snappy wave, and it even makes the braking on this crap esc work pretty well. I'm 220 and it has no problem propelling the crap out of my ass.

When I get my Focboxes back, I expect to be an even happier camper.

Oh, and DAddYE-

@sofu this is the Carvon-on-Evolve we discussed last year, and if that's the board I saw, it is the same manufacturer of the actual Carbon GT deck (not Foxen).

Very impressive to see this product realized exactly as described, and @BillGordon @DAddYE and the others who bought this thing, thank you for leading the way.  I ordered one thanks to you guys.

If the eLofty drive looks good, we'll go ahead and buy the eLofty complete next week and put together a dual-Unity, eLofty AWD build, publish it and credit you guys.

eLofty appears to have succeeded where so many other startups have failed; if that eLofty complete board is what I think it is, it has the 2018 Chinese ESC & controller with the LCD panel, 10S4P 30q in two packs, the actual Evolve OEM deck on slightly wider and stronger hangers.  

The weight of four TB 110s with four eLofty axial motors in a perfect, 50/50 weight distribution sounds ideal.

Very impressive to see the vision made real in an unexpected place.  Thanks again.

Are such immense spikes in watt hour consumption normal on regular builds? Looking at it quickly it spikes and falls from 0 - 150 - 10 pretty quickly, is this a startup on a hill or something? 🤔

Also at the beginning when it says your motor amps are in the negative(is indicates breaking, right?) It also shows a consumption of 300wh/km 😂😂 what's happening there? 🤔

There definitely seems something wrong with the consumption calculation. I believe his metr pro is set to take speed for GPS not from wheel rotation. I had crazy values when I had that turned on.

Btw they’re very very good. They cog just a little when I start on a small incline, but much better than my 6355 belt motors. 

Of course they’re so silent that you don’t hear a thing. 

So far impressed.

brakes still feeling good on SF roads? :pray:

update to plan: if the drivetrain they send me works out, we (meaning me) will hire a CNC guru to machine a limited-run of custom SR RKP hangers that are eLofty-compatible, immediately.

We'll post the drawings here, just like the LY artwork for the Flytrap - this isn't for profit, just a proof of concept.

We did custom Avenue hangers for Hobbywing hub motors last year, and they really do deliver an almost-thane experience due to a little sorbothane hemishphere in each spring, that acts as a dampener:

Great work with the avenue trucks... I didn't even know you had done this! I guess I know who to talk to when I want to upgrade the trucks for my banshee hubs :stuck_out_tongue:

Maybe I'll wait for the surfrods.... Everyone speaks so highly of them 🤷😋 thanks topcloud

So far they are perfect. I’m 190 and went down the steepest hills around, without issues. 
They’re much more strong and direct than my belts 6355.
I’ve also RKP trucks Avenue. I’ll be down for a set ;)

I noticed eLofty had listings that included varying degrees of completeness; one with the DKP parts included, one in a TKP-hanger-only setup, a complete, a complete minus the deck, and so on.  

I'd give them an A for effort on the bundles, yet they need new pics.  I have half a mind to have a friend photograph their kit for them and send them studio pictures, for free.

I don't have Avenue TKP base plates here, however, if memory serves, the Evolve hanger fits the Avenue TKP base plate with very minor modification.

My current build is 190KV with 10S4P battery with wheel dia 155mm and gearing ratio 16:50. That gives me a theoretical no load top speed of 190 * 4.2 * 10 * (16/50) * 3.14 * 155 * .000001 * 60 = 75km/hr. Till date, I have used a max of 25Amps/motor.

I am planning a similarly capable build using the 75KV elofty with 6x2 pneumatics. I am planning to use 8S5P battery. That would give me a theoretical no load top speed of 75 * 4.2 * 8 * 3.14 * 155 *.000001 * 60 = 73.5km/hr

Hi, I ma doing something similar with bergmeister wheels for a short AT commute board and believe me that with 75Kv you won't like the torque. I am using strong hubs 75Kv (by the performace compare to those or a big stronger I would say) that I converted to DD and at 12s they are crazy strong but I wouls use them up to 100, max 107mm wheels. Above too much speed and lower torque. For that I will get a custom 60Kv from the same motor. Just my two cents :wink:

I want the TB 110 mm due to the wider eLofty hanger, because it will keep the sick / proportionate look of 100 mm Boas on factory Evolve SuperCarves

I have a feeling, however, that I will wind up at ABEC 97mm or Boa 100s, max.  Hope this helps!

**EDIT: I had mixed up Kv(with unit rpm/volt) and Ke(back emf constant with unit volt/rpm) and so all the analysis here is wrong. Ignore this post**

Your 2 cents are absolutely correct. A little bit of analysis shows that I'll have push about 8 times as much current through the new motors to generate the same amount of torque. The max per motor I consume of my geared pneumatic setup is 25Amps per motor, now to get the same amount of torque it has to be 200Amps per motor. OMG. I wish I had done the calculations before :confused:

So here's the analysis assuming both motors are identical in terms of stator size and magnets.

    Case1: 16:50 geared setup with 190KV
    Case2: DD with 75KV

    KV_1/KV2 = n1/n2 = 190/75 = 2.5333   where n is number of turns in the stator
    torque on wheel1 = 50/16 T1          where T1 is the torque produced by the motor1
    torque on wheel2 = T2                where T2 is the torque produced by the motor2
    T1 = K*n1*A1 & T2 = K*n2*A2          where K is some constant and A is current
    T1/T2 = (n1/n2)*(A1/A2)=2.533*A1/A2

    torque on wheel1 = torque on wheel2  This is what we want
    (50/16) * T1 = T2
    (50/16) * 2.533*A1=**A2= 7.91A1**

The advantage of lower KV is that the motors lets you push higher amps without having to connect to a higher volt battery. Also the resistive losses will be less in a low KV motor(given same copper weight)

@Pedrodemio, @rey8801, @bevilacqua. Does, what I said, seem right? What I am little doubtful is the torque equation( `T1 = K*n1*A1`). I should double check.

yes, low kv = big torque low speed

high kv = little torque high speed

im doing a 1:4 ratio with 170kv 6374 maytechs and getting a top speed of 30mph with 165mm wheels. Its going to be so much torque i can probably pull me and another fully equipped rider.

Using the esk8 calculators is also a good idea to ballpark your build against "regular" builds

Yes correct. High Kv compare to wheels will decrease the efficiency. Same motor, same wheels I have tried 130Kv and 75Kv and the difference in energy consumption is huge. High Kv for the wheels size will make the drive really inefficient. Too much amp to generate same torque.

![image|690x260](upload://19bl8aQtAVDi3G7F4Rw56QuNSIw.png) 

(Basic Torque equation for Permag. Syn, Machines)

Psi is the permanent magnet magnetic flux, i the current and p the pole pair. Im not a fan of DD for pneumatic systems, the big downside is the immense current you have to generate for the equal torque as a geared system. How much? well, it depends on the PM-flux, but roughly you multiply the current by the gearing to get to a basic number. 

You will need an immense stator, and high amps to counteract the gearing effect on torque. 

But on the other hand, I get why there is so much interest. If you want to trade some torque and range in benefit of a smoother ride, and also have a simpler (more reliable in many cases) driving solution then go for it :+1:

@bevilacqua, I am surprised that number of turns doesn't contribute to torque. I thought it would be proportional to current*number of turns.  I am very surprised. Time to read some motor theory.

I think @Pedrodemio explained it over on his small DD thread, the KV-number does not affect torque but rather how fast it can turn. 

yeah, let me check my uni books and I'll post the literature

seems your equation is missing the inductance calculation:
![image|339x60](upload://pyj2qqglDD45At2isKdrAfS1sCd.png)

The psi in the equation is not magnetic flux, but flux linkage. Flux linkage encapsulates the number of turns without explicitly adding it into the equation.

It is possible, I'm not sure. However both equations use the same psi, which accounts for the number of turns. Kv is directly dependent on the number of turns, so it would be a bit confusing the say kv has no affect on torque.

I'm almost certain. The amount of electromotive force should scale to the flux present at the coils in the stator. More windings means a larger surface to capture flux.

Exaclty as @bevilacqua said

What limits us is thermal losses, not how much current the motor can take, that's why Kv doesn't matter for torque production, it only matters when you are building a complete system and have limitations there, in out case maximum voltage and current for battery and esc

(this is all ignoring flux saturation, assuming that we won't saturate the stator)

I think I posted this on the Feather thread, but lets dive a bit.

Lets use my small 5055 motors since they won't touch the current limits of the esc, if I use them at 190 Kv and run them at 40 A I will produce 96W jus of ohmic losses at the windings

Now, since I wanted them to be direct drive I go ahead an rewind them to 95 Kv, while keeping the same cooper fill, really important detail or this doesn't work, this is achieved by doubling the number of turns, but at half the cross sectional area

If I still keeps feeding them the 40 A, my new loss is 192 W, since I know that the original motor at 190Kv @ 40 A already hot, I can't do this, even thought that if my original gear ratio was 2, by keeping the same current in direct drive I will keep close to the same torque, but no equal since we are wasting a lot of power in heat

So we go ahead and reduce the current to 20 A, now we have half the torque as a 2:1 geared setup, while keeping the losses at the same 96 W

What we can take from here is that the is no magic done by rewinding, what dictates the motor performance is Km, which is proportional to motor torque divided to resistive loses, coincidentally you won't find this information anywhere since it would make it obviously that a motor is bad, and other at the same specs is much better

So if we want a direct drive that keeps the same performance as a belt/geared drive, we need to produce the same torque at the wheel at the same losses, basically if we would plot and efficiency graph of the motors they should look the same

We can go further and estimate how big a motor would be

Torque for a given motor can be described as T = K*D²*L, K being a constant for a given motor design, independent of windings, D the diameter and L the length

We will write that as k = T/(D²*L)

I will use my board since I've done this calculations a few times already

I run 40 A at my 6355 motors with a 14:53 gearing in 125mm wheels, that gives me  a motor torque of roughly 2 N.m at the motor and 7.5 N.m at the wheels

The K for this motor design is 9162

Now lets say we will just get this motor and enlarge it to be capable to produce 7.5 N.m at the wheels, so we do T/k = D²*L , lets limits the motor diameter to 85mm to keep a good ground clearance, and doing the calculations we get that our motor should be 128mm long, so a 85128 motor

I think I went too far, hope it's understandable 

But the main point is that gearing allows us to use a smaller motor, and there is not way to get a small motor to perform like a big one. Sure, you could go some crazy cooling, putting dry ice or whatever, running it somewhere that is -70°C, but it will be crazy inefficient, just look at the Raptor 2 and Ghost motors

If you really want to dive deep in this I suggest this book as a starting point, it's a complex topic and I'm nowhere near knowing it well, lots of times I think I have everything figured out and pops another details that makes my head spin

Thanks for the detailed explanation @Pedrodemio. 

**I had stupidly mixed up Kv(with units rpm/volts) and Ke(back emf constant with units volts/rpm)** and totally got confused.  Ke = 1/Kv. Ke is proportional to number of turns and Kv is inversely proportional to number of turns. Now it makes lot more sense. I just need **1.23times more amps to produce the same torque**. That's not too much of an increase in current(not an issue for ESC), but like pedrodemio said, for **same current the ohmic losses would be 2.5 times**(190/75, assuming same amount of copper). For the **same torque the ohmic losses would be 3.8 times**(I^2R loss).  So effectively I would see a decrease in wh/km. Currently I am getting 18wh/km, let's see how much I get with DD. 

    Case1: 16:50 geared setup with 190Kv(rpm/volts)
    Case2: DD with 75Kv(rpm/volts)
    
    Kv2/Kv1 = n1/n2 =75/190 = 0.394      where n is number of turns in the stator
    torque on wheel1 = 50/16 T1          where T1 is the torque produced by the motor1
    torque on wheel2 = T2                where T2 is the torque produced by the motor2
    T1 = K*n1*A1 & T2 = K*n2*A2          where K is some constant and A is current
    T1/T2 = (n1/n2)*(A1/A2)=0.394*A1/A2
    
    torque on wheel1 = torque on wheel2  This is what we want
    (50/16) * T1 = T2
    (50/16) *0.394*A1 = A2 =1.23A1

I've always found that DKP + thane works best on drop-through, flush-mount decks like the factory Evolves:

![1280|500x500](upload://5lUyVVScY24JmU4k5xyLWyZveB.jpeg) 

The design calls for the rider to stand between the supercarve base plates.  

I think the Evolve Bamboo ONE failed, even on urethane, because it does not feel like the other Evolves, or any drop-through.

You appear to have risers, on top of DKP base plates, and then adding the deck thickness - definitely too tall.:) 

![5D2BF0A8-1D25-4202-A07F-33CE50DF8491|375x500](upload://8aQGTMugCR4GwCO67051cLaAxgn.jpeg) ![6446DA55-5492-4E31-B80D-7288AE2CB2A8|666x500](upload://h0Zimt7AjrRoTDyVjoi9LUX74Fx.jpeg) 

If you want to try a short board, go for the Globe Spearpoint Mini:

![IMG_0981|375x500](upload://yGhrxfsPp767XMYZO0vUuRUH3Lj.jpeg) ![IMG_0996|375x500](upload://52V4pmhg5CCsLIcOF6QVGESc3xV.jpeg) 

For best board feel on DKP, however, one must stand between the baseplates and allow the deck to flex as you pump through carving.

Hope this helps my brother!

So I finally got my package from elofty this Monday...

Recorded a video of me unboxing it while coming down with a very bad case of the flu+pneumonia which currently has me admitted in a hospital.. yay!

Here is the link of the somewhat unflattering unboxing video, I apologize in advance for the shitty commentary 😅 https://youtu.be/e59u-CVtKvQ

so i guess a small delay in getting this built up by my boi @ARetardedPillow due to being hospitalized for a few days, but health is numba wun prioritay 😇😇😇

Anyhow, here are a few pics of the drives... pretty cool in person.

BUSHINGS need a swap ASAP.. wow, I’m a big boi at 230-240 with gear on, and these are tightened quite a bit and very CARVY.. I prefer my DKP setup on evolve all stock then otang purple nipple barrels on street side x1 on each truck... adds perfect stability for speed and maneuvering imo.

overall, they feel great in hand, will have a ride video within the next few weeks I hope and it will be met with good reviews.

This is basically gonna be the new carvon that isn’t super hard to get and only half the price.. a clone of the speed drive v4, according to Anna..

MUCH EXCITE.

Also Really shows you how DD is the way of the future.. quick swappable AT kit coming soon 🙌🙌🙌

torque might be an issue, but then again, you could go for a 4wd and spend less then what a real Carvon v4 speeddrive would cost ya. And get it much quicker too!!!

Looks awesome. DHL tracking says I'll receive mine tomorrow. Pretty excited.

BTW, how much did you pay for all the wheels including the airless 6" ones.

EDIT: Just realized that the pic with 6" wheels not yours, they are from the vendor.

whats the diameter of those grey wheels? How are they, good?
[/quote]

90 MM and Kenna is shipping the best kind of surprise; this is _excellent_ soft, grippy and uniform thane that features a wider contact patch than the Popocoa and Caguama.

![fullsizeoutput_229c|375x500](upload://47OL73T0XPCeXZK60XWrXoHO7MX.jpeg) 

If I had to guess: 73a and the thane feels more Seismic than Labeda.  

![image|500x500](upload://4yvE9qMUbfErAZ5j7d1fj0hlB1g.jpeg) 

For me, Orangatang 77a's have become a lot less interesting.  

I will reserve judgement until I see them under torque, yet, incredibly, eLofty might be my new favorite 90 MM thane.

TB 110s arrive tomorrow.

That's a pretty significant footprint upgrade. So cool to have more good Kegel options. My 110 set will be here soon, and yet I want three of these in 100mm.

Thanks my friend. :) Our next step is to see our eLofty board complete 2-3 BAESK8 group rides, with a 180lb pilot.  

I do believe that the Bay Area's unique combination of uphill / downhill grades with Soviet-era asphalt gives us a unique proving ground for stuff like this.

If it works out, I think we can do a group buy at cost recovery as soon as you guys want to

Now if they make different color options and bigger wheel... they will be making BANK! 



Also for the guy who asked about pricing, this is what I currently have from Kenna..

I told her to adjust it but we will see if it works out.

I think this is the OEM that cures the Boosted Stratus 85 mm, just in 90 mm. 

correction: on the eLofty unit I received, the wheel core, bearings and washers all appear identical.

personally speaking, I believe these 90 MMs could make the Mini X actually work in SF.

The Mini X is so heavy and stiff that Labedas or ABECs can, literally, bounce one off of the board while traversing rough pavement or 'tactile pavement markers' for the disabled.

@esk8jpn, awesome to hear your positive reviews. Sadly I can't ride until I figure out how to attach the pneumatic tires. Might have to 3D print the hubs. The standard aliexpress 6x2 tires won't fit.

Hey, could you elaborate on the noise aspect? Is it a rattle on bad roads? Is it more than what you’d expect from a usual belt or hub drive? Is there noise from motor bearings?

I have a carbon gt which I tried so much to reduce rattle and the culprit was the wheel bearings. Bones red race bearings just made it worse and the best solution was to clean the original ones and fill them with thick grease. This quietened them heaps but sacrificed free rolling when just spinning the unloaded wheels but it made absolutely no difference to while riding (electric boards don’t free roll like normal boards anyway so seems pointless for the marginal gains from bearings)

My lazy ass rode the Meepo ESC again today. For city riding conditions, it definitely works. Low speed setting is great for picking through pedestrian traffic with total control and high setting gives a nice rush of power right up to a respectable top speed.

If we ever do a GB, I might have to buy another set for exactly this application.

Would you need the first stage of the RKP kit to fit that? I guess you can't use only the kingpin with that baseplate?
I've never played around with swapping baseplates, so I really don't know how they work/fit, to be honest.

Right. Brain no work good.
I've always wanted to try Avenue baseplates. And if they work with the elofty kit.. two birds with one delicious stone.
At this point I'm just waiting to hear if a group buy is going to happen or not. Either way, I'm totally getting a kit :drooling_face:

it will fit, with minor modification (that's the OG Evolve / Avenue hack)

axial motors need clearance on drop-through, and Avenue baseplates are top-mount only so it's a good match

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-2/88821/20?u=topcloud

by the way, the new TB 110 wheels fit perfectly on the eLofty drive. :)

maybe one of the options on the group buy can be a pair of pre-modded Avenue base plates for the eLofty hangers.

it should be done at a machine shop.  

one can also drill a hole in the leaf spring to soften it up.

to add to @sofu 's mod, I stopped mine from 'squishing' entirely by placing a hemisphere of 50 Duro [Sorbothane](https://www.sorbothane.com) in the center of the spring:

https://www.amazon.com/Isolate-Sorbothane-Hemisphere-Non-Skid-Durometer/dp/B0084ELFIU?th=1

this sorbothane-in-spring made a big difference in board feel; on long, straight lines, my 90 mm hubs feel like thane.

the motors are 6850 long / 6700 wide.

With a 67 mm can, I'd definitely stay over 85 mm wheel and suggest a minimum of 100 mm wheel for what we do.

Axles (no wheels) are 308 mm wide, end to end.

Clearance on drop-through flush-mount decks is perfect (as Evolve re-designed for in 2016 with the dropped Carbon GT deck) for 97 MM wheels and up.

With the TB 110 mm wheels, from the top of the baseplate to the ground, is a very speed-bump friendly 125 mm.

Trucks are fully compatible with Evolve DKP base plates, both levels.

The eLofty hangers are wider than the Evolve hangers.

There are few decks that are strong and thin enough to provide the clearance the cans need at full drop-through (non-flush mount, which pushes the deck closer to the motors).  

In fact, I can only think of two: Trampa Orrsum and Loaded Icarus Flex 1 + Alan's enclosure (eboardsperu.com)

I rarely take pics of my work; @sofu 's pic is here: 

before:

https://imgur.com/a/1V2El

after:

https://imgur.com/a/kTBKc

because the Evolve base plate is drop-through, in my opinion, resetting the angle on the Avenue is a task that you do not want to 'eyeball'.  

Even though the Avenue is top-mount, the base plate is non-adjustable (you can't fix it without taking the entire thing out) so after you mess with it a few times if it wobbles - just take it in to a shop.

I placed the sorbothane (hemisphere) underneath the kingpin.

The extended shaft version that @BillGordon and @esk8jpn got. 

Unfortunately I got the standard shaft :(  and I am spending time designing wheel hubs to 3D print.

![image|375x500](upload://nnDsnw7nhHtfWJ30Ue6wW0VaHjd.jpeg) 

Guys make sure to ask for the **extended/long axle version**(34mm free shaft length) if you want to use it with the aliexpress 6x2 wheels(I have confirmed this with Kenna). The ones they ship now is 24mm free shaft length by default so suitable for regular skateboard wheel.

Umm, this is not for any pulley. This is for the eLofty direct drive that has a kegel adapter built in. The reason I made it is, I didn't specify the extended shaft while buying my motor and can't use the AliExpress wheel.  Also I have the Taulman alloy 912 now so it's going to be super duper strong.

Now it's time to print another wheel and ride test it at low speeds only. If all goes well print it in alloy 910(nylon). Since it will bend before it fails, I'll have plenty of warning(in terms of wobbling of the wheel). Printing in alloy 910 will cost me $8 per wheel.

Quick update:

I’ve asked none other than our own @sofu to put our eLofty kit through the gauntlet: 12S5P, Unity, Hoyt, TB 110s etc. 

If the test is successful, I will proceed to purchase a few more drivetrains with their latest motors to test on our own, including individual motors that we will experiment with on our own community hangers. 

In that second order, I’m happy to include your US-based orders and do a group buy. 

There will be no markup or handling fees, so if they give us x% off, we all will benefit from the same pricing. 

The next step (for me) is to get her the eLofty board tomorrow, so she can run it and later review it on . 

After the review, we will introduce Sofu to Kennah, offer feedback in Mandarin and with Sophia’s green light, we’ll proceed with a larger buy for DKP drivetrains. 

Very impressed with eLofty so far; I can see brands potentially “powered by eLofty” emerging very, very soon.

Incidentally, we’d pay for the 100 mm mold, if the wheels are the same as their 90s, just scaled up. 

My specific ask is a reverse-colorway Boosted Lunar in 100 mm, in white thane, with a space-gray, blue or red paint on the core (in full disclosure).  

Elofty surely doesn’t pour thane, yet perhaps we could get a large enough order through them to ensure a steady supply of 100 mm’s in quality wheel that any builder can white label. We know they need bigger than 90 mm with the can they have now, it’s a win-win if we can make it work.

I got my 110s, and they look amazing. First rear mounted up with no slop, but second rear had an unacceptable level of slop. But the third wheel I tried had no slop. So don't assume you got all bad or all good wheel cores. Try them all. You only need two proper kegel orientations for 2WD. 

Second, and this is a repeat, but it's kind of crucial: the drives come with the Kegel adapter screws barely fingertight. Blue LT them down, or better yet, use red like I did. I applied, tightened, backed out for an even coat, then back in firm.This has been stated before, but this is not the kind of thing you want to miss.

Ride report forthcoming.

The files are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19o1mDq6L1XR2eg-poi7ln9MzIaLHOELP?usp=sharing) if anyone else wants to print it and give me feedback. 

print setting that I used for test print:
1. 4 walls, bottom layer, top layer. Feel free to increase them. 
2. 0.2mm layer thickness
3. 25%infill gyroid(you should make it 100% for max reliability)
4. Print without cooling fan for max layer adhesion.
5. With supports(20% infill) from the base.
6. Make sure that the flow% is right so that 2 adjacent walls are fused to each other.

sooo stoked and I think you have just helped eLofty more than they realize.  

eLofty with bonafide nummies will board feel more Evolve-ier than any Evolve, straight up.  I bet the eLofty carbon GT would carve like a dream on that tire with a better turning radius than their newest GT Carbon on MBS.

When we find a CNC-er, you'll be the first to know my brother.  Thank you.

Thanks for the kind words, but eLofty is already working on a pneumatic wheels(Kenna mentioned it) so it is only a matter of time before everyone can just get it with the direct drives. 

The bearing holes were adjusted to fit the 3D printed pulleys with a press fit. I don't know the suitable tolerances for the CNC so those bearing holes have to be adjusted. Rest should be fine. I have also included the iges files for easy modification. Also if one is machining maybe remove the nut on the other side and just thread the holes on the inside hub.

signs look good; here's the latest:

- the Evolve Carbon GT deck is not available for group buy (if you're on the fence, get one now because stock is very low);
- the airless "AT" wheels are prototypes and will be excluded on our side, as they are looking into a 200 MM pneumatic option, and;
- the ESC and controller are not (yet) flashed for their specific motors, so we will be excluding the generic Hobbywing-ish ESC & controller.

Once Sofu has her way with the eLofty, the fact that she's fluent in Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese .and. understands our needs means she can talk with them directly and get a clear roadmap from eLofty and hear their RKP plans (or see if we can help them find a tall, narrow adjustable baseplate for a Caliber-compatible hanger).  

Hang tight, another week I think. :)

Oh don't be fooled by the cost. 1. They are located in China so prototyping is cheaper and quicker 2. BOM+machining cost is much less than what you imagine 3. Entry into a saturated market means that you mark it lower than your high mark-up competitors. 

As for the magnets, apparently they are rated for 140C, so plenty of leeway. 

Based on my torque requirements, I would produce about 60Watts of heat at max usage. Maybe some motor experts can chime in if that's going to be manageable or not. @Pedrodemio

I have no idea how much heat a motor can dissipate

There are so many parameters that it’s hard to make a prediction 

Best way I can suggest is to test, pick a demanding route, do it in a consistent way riding and weather wise and log everything with Metr or similar 

In my limited real world experience with different motors, the peak amp doesn’t matter, if your motor is overheating, lowering the current won’t help much unless your riding style really makes use of the extra punch

Example, my dual 5055 took the same time to overheat at 40A and at 20A, this means the motor is undersized for my riding style and terrain

I wouldn’t say this costs any more than most people belt drives. A lot of the folks he use motors alone worth $160+ then you need some mounts $40+ then trucks $60+ then pulleys $80+. That was listing the lower end parts as well. If you went with surfrodz, maytech motors and torqueboard mounts you would be looking at at least an extra $200

Yes I learned that the hard way, this is a Metr. log from Enertions R-Spec silver motors, I tried to lower battery amps from a total of 60A to 50A and motor amps from 80A to 50A to avoid heat and get better efficiency. To my surprise even with the  new Beta value the motors reached 100°C in the same distance of my ride.\
https://metr.at/r/TAWof
Here is a example of a 6364 based hub motor which I guess is similar in design then the elofty drive, sadly it has no temp sensor but the motors are hand warm after the complete ride whereas the R-Spec hubs will be at 120°C.\

Nice to see that, just be careful, the motor may be warm at the outside but cooking on the windings

Main problem is that people go from a running a belt (or whatever) setup with 60A and change to a hub and keep the 60A when it should be much lower, at that current a lot of your energy is going into heat and probably saturating the motors pretty bad, more heat

If you have time try them with something like 20A each motor, keep the battery at the same or 40A total

Does anyone have a Raptor 2 and can share the default current settings? My guess they are pretty low

They recommend 30A battery amps for each motor and 60A -60A, I am already lower than that.\
I used the 6364 motors more than one year without issues, I don't think that they are cooking. 
I took them apart to check the inside and no loose magnets or melted windings.\
The only variable is the controllers and firmware. VESC6 with Ackmaniac on 6364 and Unity on the R-Spec motors.

Tried putting a nrf51_vesc(from flipsky) meant for v6 by changing the pins but I couldn't connect to the vesc. Don't know what's going on.

BTW, I was running it off a 5S drone battery(actually a 6S battery with 1S gone bad so rewired for 5S)

presuming @marcmt88's innovation works, I hope to see these out there soon :) 

Janux Quattros are certainly not as inexpensive as a POM adapter for a Haggy wheel, yet these are undeniably the best wheels in the world available today for the TorqueBoards Direct Drive and eLofty Direct Drive.  

Janux Quattros are smaller than factory Evolve AT wheels, yet interestingly, Evolve designed and even manufactured a 150MM that was never sold and we think abandoned for the MBS deal; @okp has actually seen the Evolve 150s, and of course he has, because he is legend.

Quattro 150s can run Bergmeister tires for clearance or trade-up to the wider, heavy-duty Chinesk8 '6x2' never-flat tire.  150MM on RKP/TKP needs no introduction by me; that's every Shooter build ever.

Makes me think this gen2 Carbon that we're all contributing towards just might board feel among the finest Evolves ever made, bar none - if not the best, ever, by returning the Gen 2 Carbon to 150 mm.  

Quite an accomplishment for the community, if you consider it.  Tesla did the same thing with a Lotus.  Give yourselves a pat on the back. :) 

Now, we stay tuned for @sofu's test... with Marc's new Quattros for Direct Drive and TorqueBoards 110s.

Many thanks to my friend Marc for speeding this innovation along; always happy to sponsor innovation for the greater good.  @mishrasubhransu since these aren't POM and Quattros run a few hundred bucks heh, pls PM me your address, and for your measurements, I will send you the brand-new Enertion R-SPEC offroad wheels that will fit your eLofty drive, so you too can look kalifornia kustom :) Appreciate you, brother.

@mishrasubhransu That looks great. Thanks for sharing. Can you please tell me how stable TKP trucks are? How fast can you go without getting wobbles?

Great catch!  I only have normal human hearing :) yet I think the eLofty video is quieter than a Ranger which, if I’m really listening, I think could be lower tire noise.

This is where I suspect the Bergmeister tire will truly shine with the eLofty, as the Berg is the quietest pneumatic of its diminutive size. Time will tell!

I guess I didn't ride it fast enough to get the wobbles. I'll take it outside only after my battery pack and an enclosure is ready which will take another week or so. I'll keep you all updated.

I am going to ride on roads and the torque is more than enough for me. However if you use larger wheels and ride on grass then you probably need a 4wd. Get a 2wd first and see how it feels.

this is the custom Avenue hanger @donta42 made for Avenue RKP base plates, with the Sorbothane hemisphere that eliminates almost all vibration, that I described earlier.

as we're delivering the Evolvelofty to @sofu on Thursday :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: we will also be testing one prototype CNC Quattro wheel, and if it works, you just may see Janux Quattro DD's added to our group buy. 

We are presently considering one more innovation; we are considering a CNC hanger to adapt the eLofty motors and Janux Quattro DDs to one of two, leading RKP base plates:

* Surf Rodz RKP-compatible hangers, motor and traditional.  Note: tall SR RKP adjustable base plates will be highly recommended to provide clearance for the eLofty motors, @sender is working on these.

* Caliber II-compatible hangers, motor and traditional.  Note: @rey8801's Hammock adjustable base plate will be highly recommended for the eLofty motors (I ordered two).

If we can get your guidance on Caliber or Surf Rodz RKP, I think we can finalize scope, get to production and make these wheels and RKP hangers real, show Reddit that our community can deliver the goods.

We won't be the first to bring axial drives to RKP, but we will be the best.

So I couldn't resist and went for a ride outside with nrf51_vesc installed. It now connects to the vesc_tool, turns out my phone needed a restart. **Look at the wh/km** :smiley: . I almost came back to where I started from.  I was pretty surprised and thought maybe I have the wheel diameter wrong, but no, it's 155mm with gearing ratio 1:1 as it should be. I video recorded a small part of the ride and is linked at the bottom.

As for steep hill climbing, it climbed the hardest hill nearby, albeit at a lower speed. It is understandable because I currently have a 5S battery. Climbing needs current draw and that leads to sag. Now imagine the sag on top of 5S battery. 

@janpom,I was riding at around 30km/hr and didn't feel any wobble.

![image|281x500,80%](upload://4F3FGt2jedNEy93ORykdHMgbMow.png) 

At the end of the ride the 1st wheel lost it's tire holding ring as it went over the cobbled stone speed bumps. Finally! I am impressed that a PLA prototype with 25% infill lasted as long as it did. The other wheel that has more walls and top layers hasn't fallen apart yet. I want to see how PETG will fare at those settings before I finally print Nylon. I can probably print at 100% infill and be done with it. Will probably cost be a couple of dollars more.

PM me with further non eLofty questions otherwise we'll clog the eLofty thread. I am pretty happy with my regular AT build. This is for a second board. 

My Direct drive build, as seen above, is barely complete. It's just a test setup to get things rolling, quite literally. So your question regarding mileage/range is better directed at other users( BillGordon, topcloud, DAddYE, esk8jpn and few more. You would have to search who else)  who have ridden it more than me.

The aluminum hub that topcloud just got custom made from marcmt88 might be able to fit bigger tires. @marcmt88 should be able to tell you.

If you have access to 3D printer then my hubs will work fine for all the tires that will work with the aluminum hub metion before, but I would advise to get it printed from shapeways.com in Nylon for peace of mind, although cost is insane($80 per rear wheel hub). Might as well go for the aluminum hub if you are going to pay that much.

Well I actually thought they made the DD but nope they are a reseller as all the others... Still few months and everyone will provide this DD. That's a pity to me. It means they are stock with mould ecc for productions so not fast upgrades possible.
If you pay that, it mean these DD BOM is really low. remove battery, deck ecc... you have more or less 50-90$ for the drive.

I won't be surprise if at the end the motor factory is the same for a lot of known brands.

No affiliation with Miles and I’ve only seen them on Craigslist ;)  

Remember how I said this is the year China gets axial direct drive right. We’re going to see more of these. Looks like by Summer now, which is awesome. 

Boosted was widely copied in gen 1, right. 

This year, Evolve, BajaBoard, MBS and Trampa copies are all in production at different plants in mainland China. 

These are all esk8; I believe the carbon fiber-print MBS deck is on eBay now. Vic Duan of Verreal posted a video recently with the BajaBoard copy. The Trampa copy is the same Chinesk8 channel truck esk8 kit we see on DIY, paired with a black wooden deck that looks like a Kheo and those Sunmate FakerStars. 

My opinion, the only one that’s ‘good’ is the Evolve with axial, because that’s an actual step-up from Evolve today in every way (power, maintenance, quiet, trucks are better). 

I think we can expect to see a few Bamboo GT clones from a few SIs this year, each with their own flavor of components. The carbon decks floating around are either genuine Evolve OEM or what they call “Carbon Evo” which is a Carbon GT knockoff that has rounded kicks, like a dance board (I don’t like it). 

The latter deck will be offered by 3-4 manufacturers in a $1599 complete.

So, are the parts in that pic the same as the eLofty?  Maybe. Those look like my motors which have already been replaced. 

Enclosure is real cf, deck is supposedly even better than Evolve’s. I like these DKP trucks better than the real thing. 

I am amazed that board could be bought for so little with 10S4P 30q - I would think $700 is manufacturer cost. Please post a link, happy to talk with them about bringing in 10+ for the group buy (we’d part them out at cost).

Average speed was pretty low, maybe around 20km/hr. I was very wary of the 3D printed wheels breaking. Haha. And it did, but fortunately not in a way that it would throw me off the road.

So what I suspect the reason for the insanely low wh/km is low rolling friction. For my ride I initially went uphill and then downhill. The downhill part I didn't have to apply any throttle. If it were my belt drive I would have to apply some throttle to ensure that it kept moving at a decent speed.

Awesome, with a average speed of 20 km\h I would have expected something more like 13-15 Wh/km and that on pneumies is remarkable. Even my gear drive with 110mm wheels eats up 18 Wh/km but I am also a heavier guy 90kg.\

That wouldn't really work, because the heat would melt that shell. What needs to be done for faster production is to make an injection mould. Or make a negative of the part in plaster. Those things are additional headaches which is unnecessary given I have a 3D printer. 

But why does it matter that it take 17 hours to print? It's not I am standing in front of watching it print. You just give it print and go about your day.

So the mystery of lost wh/km is **somewhat** solved. I just did a complete loop that GPS tells me was 3.37km but the vesc odometry says 4.862 km.  

The **incorrect** consumption((wh_out - wh_in)/dist) is reported to be **7.8Wh/km**=((39.87-2.14)/4.862).   
The **correct** consumption can be calculated as: (39.87-2.14)3.37 = **11.19Wh/km**. This is why I said **"somewhat"** earlier. It is still pretty low, given I am using half penumatics. Haha. 

The corrected average speed is 3.37km/9.75min = 3.37km/0.1625hr = 20km/hr  

The one variable which I didn't take into account is the **number of magnets**. I just said "yes" to the default value of **14 magnets** during VESC setup but maybe that's wrong. 14magnets*4.862/3.37=20.2magnets. So I guess eLofty has **20 magnets** or 10pole pairs. I'll ask Kenna if that's true.

**EDIT: Kenna replied that it 18.** Either the tire diameter in VESC is a bit more or the GPS underestimates the distance a bit because it measure in a straight line(even though you are carving)

11Wh/km is still impressive. 18 Magnets is similar to the design of the 6364 based hubs I linked the Metr. data above. ![20180903_112732|690x388](upload://qVsPEg1EqrxrgNJpEf8ShKhaRwy.jpeg) 
The Magnets are glued gap less and freeroll or coasting is quite good on them. Used as hubs the efficiency is a bit less in my use case, if the pneumies really would make them more efficient due to less rolling resistance would be awesome.

Generally, Acetal Delrin (POM) is typically 3-4x more expensive than aluminum especially with larger stock.  The cost is offset by machining time which typically takes half the time to cnc aluminum.  Price wise, parts made out of POM is ~10 to 20% cheaper than aluminum.

Surely similar to bike tires the rolling resistance depends on the air pressure which is greatly adjustable.  With a good supple slick tire and like 40psi (guessing) should be very low rolling resistance.   How much pressure do the tires take?

And what’s the phase resistance as measured on bldc tool?

Nothing makes sense anymore :sweat_smile:

My guess would be a way lower R due to a longer stator, but its double the value of the raptor hubs and and the Hummies

My guess is it comes down to riding style and current settings, my guess is once you get used to them and build more trust on the wheels the consumption will go up

This shows that a high pressure wheel can keep a good efficiency, can't wait to try 85 psi or more on mine

Nicely done :slight_smile:

That is also the carbon fiber deck with the rounded kicktail style edges I mentioned, previously, wearing same 63xx external motors that are the new 'standard' on the Evolve clones of 2019 that we're about to see, everywhere.

(I checked on the wheels, they're still in CAD)

I will offer that out of all the manufacturers that I know who are going after Evolve in this next generation, that Ownboard will likely be the most successful on a per-unit basis.  This is because we can expect Ownboards' ESC will work with their cans perfectly in FOC, as Ownboard has the steady-supply of motors needed to commit to a min qty at Hobbywing for 500 units.

Like I said, this is the year the industry sets their sights on Evolve.  Next year it will probably be LaCroix, what I keep hearing.  Whatever you guys promote on Facebook is generally what they consider making.

I’m probably not adding anything you haven’t found already but just in case, In the “focbox unity support...” thread there a long conversation about throttle curves starting at like post 33.

In post 53 @trampa  explains why he cosiders changing the pos/neg ramp time settings or other options better than messing with the throttle curve. Then they elaborate on this in the following threads.

I think I’ve seen someone mention a trim nob on that remote that you could try to adjust.

Anyways I’m sure I’m not saying you haven’t considered, but thought I’d throw that out there

Don’t play with the trim. That adjusts the neutral dead band position. If turn the board will hold that speed constantly without you finger moving the trigger, turn it the other way and the brakes will be applied until you either turn it back or pull the throttle a little to reach the dead band again.

Works great for a poor mans cruise control

I will go to check Ownboard’ DD motor on imitation boards of Evolve at Hong kong show tomorrow morning. 

I guess it’s same as Elofy’s. And I’m not sure but they said the double king pin trucks are made by same factory of Evolve’s, and trucks has same width of Evolve. (Additional to say, we only can know about the precision after getting)

If you have question, PM me or write question here within 9 hours from now please. I’ll ask them. 

But I guess there’re only sales people so there’s possibility we can not get enough detailed answers.

(I’m not a stealth marketer of Ownboard. And their family (?) company made not enough quality metal hub wheels for AT. But I think they and some Chinese companies can improve more when they get good partners like Exway )

That's not the case for me with hummies. (With official Focbox now and 6.6s before ) at no speed and full brake. It will roll a little bit but you definitely can't push it.

No well with my DD I can not push it. That's not my case. It's just really weak at almost stop. That what I meant. If I push it or gain a bit of speed on a slope brake becomes stronger. I also use really low setting compare to others since I have 12s3p battery. My settings are - 60 - 12 and it brakes strong. With Flipsky 6.6 I had to go - 22 to get back the strength. I didn't know you broke an unity.

Good thinking. That's a good way of finding if it's just the nature of motor or ESC's fault.

Since Sophia mentioned it, I notice it more now. It has nice braking until it reaches about 1m/sec(3.6km/hr) and then the braking is pretty weak.

I got some answers, but generally ownboard’s DD motors are same as Elofty they said.

Next week they’ll release on their web shop. 
They will sell one compete deck (not Evolve style carbon deck) and parts ( maybe set of motor and trucks). Price is not decided but they said it will be same as Elofty. Single king pin truck will be available.

Now the motors only have KEGEL adapter. And their metal core rubber wheels can be set.  ( I recommend to make ABEC type too. )

New complete deck includes vesc with new remote (for double motors ) and has 10S2P battery same as their past model. Deck is flexy. 

And Evolve style complete will have 10S3P. But they don’t have release date now. ![image|666x500](upload://uceWtu4ZGZcdXQwyeLbnTNJRjYC.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://ga72XkA1N9TDSFDkW0XMVZTz5me.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://zfKABhkxynveol8Q4Kj5CgSRh4N.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://4TDL8oCBKxySe6BAWNX0OG4s576.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://87jYagBR13S7EiodTkmQ9gaIFGe.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://aChwojZwo2J7D5O0iAwjUlnomCX.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://zvI4s3ektZdGvNd8W1wUcjtjktc.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://2LoOHm6DbIruPHK15wyazSVvobK.jpeg)

One thing which is different about their motor vs eLofty is that their adapter is longer and use a big spacer to mount the wheels, this pushes the wheels apart. Not good in terms of stress on axle. 

eLofty is definitely more compact.

Can't say too much about Elofty drives yet. The battery we put on the Gen2 deck somehow died and the metr stopped working in pretty early in the ride. With the setup we had, all I can say is it has good very torque and once you tuned the throttle curve, the acceleration is good. But for braking you can brake hard down to some rolling speed (maybe 5mph). And then you basically have no brake. Not sure it's the unity or inherent design of the drives. I don't have this issue with hummies on FOCBOXes and 6.6s.

As for steep hill climbing, it climbed the hardest hill nearby, albeit at a lower speed. It is understandable because I currently have a 5S battery. Climbing needs current draw and that leads to sag. Now imagine the sag on top of 5S battery.
[/quote]

I had taken this video the very first day I put on those PLA 3D printed wheels. From the video I don't know if you can see or not how steep the slope is. It climbed that on **155mm wheels on 5S battery**. Now that should give one a sense of torque at 10S. So I don't know how much more torque does one expect from non-geared motors. It can easily handle 110mm. Of course the equation changes when someone is significantly heavier(I weigh 76kg)

The noise is coming from the front MBS wheels on brick path.

Man don't get me wrong, but as me and others we have a different taste for torque. To better understand I search a torque capable of through you off above 40kmh if you don't balance well your weight. I am sure they bring you from A to B, that's fine. What I think @brenternet meant is that when he gave the full throttle the response didn't give him the feeling he was looking for. I can understand. I also made a DD mad Fury using 75Kv and they are really strong with 90mm, now I use 97mm wheels and they are still plenty strong, but I also said to people who will go them that probably are really nice up to 100mm wheels. Not because they won't move the board but because they won't be able to deliver the same torque. Thsts why I am now testing new 60Kv motor for AT set up. It's all about what you need.

That's a fair point. I was thinking about videos in which they try to go uphill(comparing multiple boards) and are not able to and that's how they judge how capable the board is and just wanted to say that this one would be plenty capable at 110mm. Sorry, I might have come off as a bit rude.

Most of all, I want to thank @sofu, @Winfly and all BAESK8 for driving this invaluable test, for all of us.  

We tried this last year with the Metasurf drives and let's just say when I heard @FranciscoV and @Touch415 posting on Facebook that the axles were bending on our test units lol, the first thing I thought was: someone is going to read this, and save themselves from injury and that's awesome.  That's what it's all about, the science.

This year, it's eLofty science.  Huge major difference: Ownboard means scale and that's a more real-world reason to ask @Deodand to check this out for us on the Enertion FOCBOX Unity.  

It's all stoked, I think this new crop of axial drives (and the 6868 outrunner motors) will drive new people to DIY like it did for Evolve owners who sought their first battery upgrades.  Unity could be ready for folks who want more out of their Ownboard Carbons.  @marcmt88's wheels will be ready for Ownboard Carbons.  Easy to imagine a picture of that Ownboard Carbon wearing Janux Quattros all over Instagram.

Again, huge heartfelt thanks to @sofu, @Winfly for always pushing the envelope, to @BillGordon and @DAddYE for finding these things in the first place and to @Touch415 and @FranciscoV for always keeping it real.  Love you guys, mean it

Yeah I really don't know what to think about the DDs... At full battery when the battery worked it was nice on flat ground... Torque was good. It made it up twin peaks on low battery with good torque and no difficulty at all. But braking at below 2-3mph was non existent. Not sure if that's the unity or the drives. @Winfly wanna put the TB on something real quick and test the full short on both?

Hey gotta be honest🤷🏻‍♂️,  our group rides are 25-30 miles with hill climb and some down hill perfect grounds for testing, having less braking is no joke, especially if your hauling ass and need the stopping power.... motors were fire hot once we reach twin peaks and that with 125lbs rider, who knows what the out come will be with 160-190 lbs rider, yes most motors get super hot wen you reach the top of the hill, I remember hummie hubs were semi hot and the enertion hubs were more hot,.. hey maybe if you live in a city without traffic and hills and it’s  flat and only ride under 20mph these elofty will fit you perfect 👌🏼...

So, when’s the group buy? :smile:
[/quote]

Quick update:

On the ESC front, I reached out to Kenna this morning with an update that Sofu is working with Jeff on the Unity.  Ownboard will ship and this provides us the opportunity to see how their Hobbywing ESC performs. 

On the wheel side, I think here in the Bay Area, modestly speaking, we have every Kegel wheel on the market to test against TB and eLofty.  I feel confident the right equasion will be solved.  @BillGordon is discussing the potential to source larger, 100 MM wheels (we understand wheels take time, yet another source than Labeda would be great).  They are testing 200 MM pneumatics and airless, and my opinion, I think they will stick to the baconator wheels because they are cheaper and faster to produce than urethane.


![image|666x500](upload://dC6m7ku4LsUBbzU0E6XXKMBM4Jd.jpeg) 

Finally, on drivetrain, we will see another motor change.  This is purely conjecture on my side, but I think it will be the larger 6368 silver motors that @Tetsu posted (and by the way dude, you rock for going in and visiting with Ownboard, thank you and @esk8jpn for all the eLofty/ownboard love).

Makes me wonder if we do a group buy today, will we be looking to replace our parts in two months for those bigger motors. 

I think Sofu's review with a working battery and brakes will tell us what to do, next.  

update: we also have a standing order for the new, larger motors to ship as soon as they're available.  

The "Master Plan(tm)", in full disclosure, is to ask @marcmt88 for a work order to prototype a Caliber II hanger that we can put the bigger eLofty motors on, underneath @rey8801's Hammock baseplate.  

Pretty sure that is the best "open source Carvon" recipe that we can come up with.  Knowing Ownboard and a couple more unnanounced brands are working with eLofty gives me comfort the platform will be around, DD won't be a niche option anymore.

they might be closer to the TB size in the new motor they described to me this morning.

I would always expect Torqueboards, MAD axials, etc. to outperform the eLoftys, however.  They're building for the masses, slower carving.  Basically, head-on with Evolve.  I think they will end up with 130KV 6368s, yet that is purely conjecture on my side.

THIS IS NOT A MOTOR :) I sent it out as a joke and triggered panic with a friend of mine, lol idk.  esk8 people are wired up!

This is the Quattro wheel hub on my tumbler - look at the construction :) once it is test-fit this week we'll order a set

Does anyone know the stator size of TB vs Elofty vs Ownboard 6368? As well as their pole counts? Too lazy to dig through all the replies. I know TB motors are Delta terminated just like most motors.

What are the wheel sizes for hummie and enertion? The eLofty was paired with 110mm wheels, right?

Going up a hill current will be proportional to wheel size(after you remove the wind drag and other dissipative forces) and heat is proportional to square of current. @Touch415  I hope you can see the flaw in your comparison. 

I would love to see apples being compared to apples. Like TB 75KV to eLofty 75KV with 110mm wheels.

Elofty took form the thread, wrote by @mishrasubhransu 53*42mm which actually surprise me, it's pretty big. Same size of my DD Mad Fury.

TB seems actually smaller [quote="torqueboards, post:532, topic:61152, full:true"]
Hummie is able to use a much longer stator due to it being in-wheel. I tried to fit longer but it was nearly impossible while keeping it reliable. It would also push our setup to use a much longer hanger. Our stator is 52.8x40 but I believe we can fit a stator up to about 45mm with sensors.

I'd like to chime in with my own anecdote on direct drives in regards to braking and heat.  I haven't tested my new TB DD on the 12S built yet but do have the Carvon XLs (85kv) running 107mm on a 10S running dual focboxes setup.  Braking at speed is fine but does get weaker as the board slows down forcing you to mostly foot brake to stop.  My experience echos @rey8801 where it seems 97-100mm wheels are the sweet spot for 75kv DDs because I had the same experience with the Carvon Exo motors as well.  In regards to heat, the larger motor on the XLs fare a bit better than the Exos.  The XLs get fairly hot too after a good ride on mixed elevations.  I'm beginning to think this behavior is something that is a quirk with all DD in general and you might need to enable reverse in order to achieve full braking for heavier riders and when running big wheels.

I think it comes down to the lower rolling resistance of these motors. Mine even without weight start to roll with the minor slope. it really almost feels as a normal skate wheels with a bad bearing let say. Of course is not the same as a normal free wheels but it's the closet I got so far. Probably the normal drag from belt motor helps at really low speed where regenerative braking are inefficient.

Oh about the weak breaking issue there was an update put out a while ago to fix breaking for the unity. I have hummie hubs and when I used them before it was updated the breaking was next to nothing lower than 5 mph. The update made the breaking flawless.

@dougpage I think that firmware fix was to fix a quirk where if you're running big wheels or pnematics, the board will jerk after sliding to a near complete stop.  I've experienced this issue back when I had a La Croix board running Foc Boxes as it caught me by surprise as I was braking to a full stop, almost threw me off the board when I wasn't prepped for it.  Not sure if that fix applies to the weak braking as the board slows down in the case of direct drives.

@Hummie, well **elofty is 0.087ohm@75RPM/V** so why are you surprised that **wowgo is  0.190ohm@56RPM/V**? It just means they use less copper than eLofty. It's kind of evident from their wattage rating of 350W continuous and 1000W peak.

I'll do a KV test on my eLofty and tell you the results.

Here is a realtime plot for eLofty. Kenna said they use  20 magnets(10 pairs) so that can be used to find the KV.

rpm/volt = (erpm/pole_pair)/(volts\*duty_cycle) = (9597/10)/(19\*0.95) = 53.16KV. Well, so these are ~55KV not 75 as advertised.   

@rey8801, what resistance are you getting on the mad hubs(and yours) dd? and what's the KV for that one?

I talked Manager of EOVAN and found his English skill are not good. So this is incorrect  but that means one piece ESC with dual motor cotorol function like enertion’s “Unity”. 

But I’m so surprised that he didn’t know the name of “ABEC”. They need “brain” to improve more I guess. I also suggest to improve more about finish and quality about past metal wheels that was blamed in ths forum.  

And...  maybe we also need to tell what is coping. To copy is normal in worldwide I guess, but sometimes it will be not good for  innovation of eboards.

Hi! That actually makes sense due to the speed reached by @sofu and @Winfly tests. Mad hub are therefore MAD Fury are 75Kv. I am now getting a custom 60Kv version to try AT. That actually better for you.
On my 75Kv I top easy above 55kmh on 12s that's why I didn't want to say anything but they looked rather slow for the Kv. If they are 60Kv as Meepo then it's ok.

armed with the Hammock adjustable base plate, alone, folks can take their TB 218 MM hangers and outrunner motors and simply bolt them to a 20° deck like the MBS Atom all the way up to the 30°'ers, like the LaCroix.

Add in a 60Kv AT option for MAD DD, AWD, it's going to sound as quiet as a mountain bike in the woods.

they where already available, me and @deucesdown are getting them. As I said at the time, I had to insist a lot to make them change the Kv ratio. So that is the lower they can do but they never tested. Only the winding changed so I hope the performance stays the same since they are really good for a DD motor with a decent weight. Should get it soon. I will report it on thread for sure. If it sucks I will tell you! Of course they are intend for street and grass, not for hard core mountain board.

:sunglasses:

Behind the main 12mm nut that keeps the motor in place, there is a very thin other nut that looks like a 13mm washer, maybe 2mm thick. I thought it was part of the main axle at first. Scrap away all the glue you can, then use a very thin lubricant, find very sharp pliers, and try to unscrew the ununscrewable... It helps to go back and forth rotating the nut to help getting all the glue residue out of the thread.

This element of their design presents a major commercial concern.

I understand the need to keep that plate flush, yet if one motor fails, a reseller will have to replace the entire drivetrain with both motors.  

Very expensive.  That needs to be user-replaceable.

Else, people are going to 'jailbreak' them anyway. :)

I think they have to release a user doable repair. Not just factory. But if it costs then peanuts or the failure rate is low enough, they can get away with replacing entire drives. 

But sooner or later, someone will make a complete instruction to elegantly disassemble them. Just gotta wait. Haha.

But they way them have assembled,  it is very stable. Nothing will rattle out.

I think expectations were low and it surpassed those low expectations. That is why there was excitement! They way Ive interpreted the thread so far is that they work great as a cruiser build with minimal hills. Braking a little suspect but the motors perform. The newest issue seems to be removing the motors but the product is still mew and changing. Definitely gonna wait for a newer version when these small issues are dealt with.

No data, no comparison with equivalent drives or setups, just bashing, classic trolls. You guys make a lovely couple.

Edit: We are all rooting for these drives because they are inexpensive and build solidly. If they actually prove themselves it will be great for all end users. We already have the more expensive TBDD and it's good to analyze where these guys stand relatively. We are all exploring what the limits are, what setup they work well with, what terrain type etc. **Now criticism is welcome when coupled with more data and less of repeated emojis.**

Hit a nerve @FranciscoV?

Your only contribution to this thread is showing glee in support of @Touch415 at the prospect of these drives not delivering the goods. You're like that guy who stands behind the bully in a teen movie parroting everything Chad the Cruel Quarterback says. "Yeah, that's right nerds!"

You act as if direct drives are an all-out assault aimed at eradicating belt drives from the face of the earth. Belts are awesome, and have had quite a bit of time to show that fact. I am slowly and shittily building a dual belt board because different stuff is fun to try and nice to have as an option.

Know what else is fun to try and nice to have as an option? Direct Drives and Hubs.

I live on the other side of the planet, so I won't be able to take part in the "FranciscoV Super Tough Guy Most Awesomest Hill Challenge Ever." But I have no doubt that me and my inferior equipment could not possibly keep up with an esk8 SuperStar like yourself and the incredibly specific torture test you have suggested. 

Some run from danger. Some heroes Esk8 directly towards it. 

I won't take any more of your time as someone is no doubt posting something they're excited about in another thread, and you're probably itching to get in there and spoil the fun.

Come on Tony, coming into a DD thread telling people to use belts is reminiscent of those who yell at us to push on our boards. Different strokes for different folks.

As a side note, there are plenty of people around the Bay Area with lower powered boards. They just avoid hills and traffic, just like many bicyclists do. The group ride route isn't most people's commute.

It's always a telltale sign of a bully/troll when you call them out for being said bully/troll and their immediate response is either "you can't handle criticism" or "you're so sensitive." The irony is just too good.

It's worse than an Apple fanboy hanging out in an Android thread, waiting to see anything negative, just waiting to jump in and give their _valuable opinion._

The reason I'm here (as I'm sure a lot of us are) is to find out both the good _and_ the bad about these motors, in all kinds of environments/conditions, from people _who actually own them_.

I have a friend with TB DD and an extra Metr unit that we can throw in next ride but I can tell you right now that weak low speed braking affects all direct drives. You will be able to minimise it by running a 4x4 setup but I am yet to try a set of motors that isn't affected by this. I have Carvon SDV4 as well as hummies and access to TB. So far the only set with nice strong breaks at low speeds are hummies (yes I know they are not DD - insert DD argument). My friend with the TB DD has to foot brake on steep hill stops where as on the hummies I more or less come to a complete stop on significantly lower brake settings (too much for him will lead to wheel lock up at higher speeds). As for the Carvon drives they are in 4x4 config but am waiting on the deck to see the results there, I'm pretty sure they are 115KV so its not much point trying to compare them in 2WD.

You have to remember here that a lot of people want torque. It gets you out of messes, gives you better brakes and in general is more fun. There is not point having a top speed of 80kmh if it takes you 10 minutes to get there if you catch my drift. In saying that these drives do offer a lot for their price and that is something that is good to remember. If someone was on a budget and could only afford $xxx and did not want belts then these may be an option. In their current form though DKP is kindof useless. They don't really accelerate by the looks of it and even if they could do 50kmh they would be a death trap until the RKP version is available. 

Quality really is in the eyes of the beholder. For me it needs to be fast, have good torque, stable, durable and most importantly reliable. The speed and power come from high grade magnets which I'm almost sure that these drives do not run, stability is not there as they are designed for DKP and as for durability and reliability only time will tell. I'm not trying to neg them here but for that price you need to make sacrifices. Its not impossible for someone to make some amazing drives and sell them for no margin or below cost but this is China we are talking about.

Torque, reliability, good brakes I fully agree with that!\
Quality, how to define that? By price?\
I have tried Maytech Hubs 80$ each, Meepo Hubs 60$ each and Hubs who are four to six times the price but not made by Hummie.\
The most expensive ones out of this failed within 200km of riding, not only one set, two sets! Out of those hubs I tried, the Meepo ones where the most reliable without issues, Maytech hubs get really hot too. You can ask @rey8801, he used the Meepo hubs on 12S setup and seemed to have had fun with them.\
As for braking, my gear drive setup gives me the most linear and pleasantly strong braking, between the hubs Enertions silver motors are the strongest.\
I think you can use the elofty drives not only in DKP you can mount them on TKP base plates. @BillGordon is using them like this if I recall correctly. Sounds like it could be fun for me and is something else to what we already have.\
In my case, I use my boards to commute and not for group rides, there are not many opportunities on my commute where I can get over 40km/h. In my use case I rather prefer to have a efficient drive train which gets the most out of my battery.\
I am really looking forward to all the new DD from @rey8801 from Torqueboards and elofty, until now there was just one option which was unoptainable.\
But I have to admit that I fell in love with my gear drive and the only hubs I would like to own are Hummies!

@Friskies, I read your whole post, but you didn't mention what you consider your high quality direct drive. If you want to compare to hummie you have to put 83mm wheels on them.

Also you speculate that since price is cheap they can't be good quality as opposed to pointing out that what makes them poor quality? What sort of reasoning is that? If you want to overspend on everything in life, believing that it will be the best, that's your prerogative. But, that's not a scientific test of quality. 

I use them as TKP, not DKP.

Between my friend and I we have about 4 meepo hub sets. They were good for the price but the moment you get on the hummies you realize that they are just worlds apart, I consistently have members in group rides astounded at how easily I keep up and even outperform some of their setups. All motors will get hot (you can make any motors hot enough by just running continuous high amps through them) so it becomes how much heat they handle heat before irreparable damage. The weakest part heat wise in most motors are the magnets. If you get the best quality magnets you will get higher power and higher heat thresholds. I know there is a lot more that goes into motors than that in regards to maintaining magnetic fields et. Speak to @Hummie about it - he is honestly a genius and will tell you how much parts actually cost lol.

@evoheyax sums up quality motors pretty well .

[quote="evoheyax, post:653, topic:25251, full:true"]
We recommend 12s for these hubs. I’m sure you could do much higher also, theres nothing really stopping you.

1500 watts per motor in 4wd is where I start to lose traction on hard accelerations, so if you really need every little bit of power, theres always that option.

In terms of how much power these motors can take, it’s really unknown at this point. I think 1500w con is a conservative number.

At the end of the day, what makes a motor powerful and to be able to handle high current and high amps:

* Small air gap (check)
* Large stator (check)
* Lots of copper (check)
* Big and powerful magnets (check)
* Ultra low winding resistance (check)
* High heat components in case things do get hot under high loads (check)

In terms of size, these are larger than most outrunner motors. Bigger stator, more copper, and a lower winding resistance. Everything in the motor is rated to at least 300 F, most parts are rated to 400 F, though I wouldn’t recommend getting them close to there. If you really want the power, 4wd is a better way to go anyways. Don’t think the focbox or any vesc can reliably do 80a con anyway. You do less stress on the motors and esc’s also. I think 3000w con is more than enough for most who want a dual drive hub motor. That’s 10x the power output of those cheaper china hub motors.

The only outrunners I expect will beat these hub motors will be 80mm outrunners. Those guys have a much larger stator, larger magents, ect, and a hub motor made for air filled tires would be the only way you could compete with those things. Even then, I beat Dereks 80mm motors off the line 3/3 times. Only time will tell!

I keep my mouth shut these days as it doesn’t look good even questioning other sellers’ stuff.  Thanks for the endorsement of the motors @Friskies, and I agree with u and the v4 im pretty happy with but I’m far from a genius and just a one-trick pony.  I’m a hobbyist who wanted a good hub when none were available 

I bet these motors will more than satisfy a lot of people. My only criticism is this widespread goal of sticking giant wheels like pnumies on.   But then some people may live somewhere flat n not be a power monster and all good for them.  So many different types of riders.  If it doesn’t break it’s good
How to not break?  Good magnet glue that can take high temp, vacuumed in winding resin, and phase leads that don’t end up shorting to the motor case

Sure, sure, I agree with you 100% that in the end they are all motors. But to have a fair comparison, you must put 83mm wheels. Because wheel size linearly affects torque and quadratic in heat. Only then is your comparison valid. Otherwise it's just your speculation.

Hi, yep I am have extensively used meepo hubs. For the price they are worth it. At 12s you get 43kmh, nice torque since the mpw Kv. Pretty high efficiency.

Yea, this is why I have the goal of making a pneumatic hub motor based on the hummie v4 design. I will be finding out soon how moes race wheels (120mm) affect heat in the hummie hubs but I expect problems.

With any of these direct drives, I think pnuematics will make them overheat fast. You lose leverage with these big diameter wheels and small diameter stators.

Umm, really? Say you have identical motors and have 2 setups. 
1. 2wd with 83mm wheels, with Kv
2. 4wd with 166mm wheels, with Kv

Simple math tells me that both of these setups can produce equal force, but the i^2R losses will be doubled in the second case. However, since they are distributed over 4 motors(and not 2) so motors in both the setups will heat up equally when each setup produces the same force. 

So they wouldn't heat up more. Am I wrong somewhere?

---------------------------------------
Now if we consider the case below(same size but different Kv), I have an intuition that both setups will be equivalent in terms of heat production and force production. But math has to worked out to say for sure.
1. 2wd with 83mm wheels, with Kv
2. 4wd with 166mm wheels, with Kv/2

A lot really does depend on the motor itself and what it's built with. It's hard to generalize too much.

They may be capable of producing the same torque, but what your forgetting is how that torque is applied. The bigger wheel has a longer distance between the stator teeth and magnets (where the torque is being created) and the contact surface of the wheel.

It's like trying to close a door by pushing the hing side of a door vs pushing the handle side. Your proposing a linear increase in torque when in fact you need a quadratic.

You can change the kv, and it will help, but it's not equivalent to using a larger diameter stator. This is why even Dexter himself said the current DD's with pnuematics is not a permanent solution.

We can handwave around concepts all day but to do it the right way we have to write down the math. I fear this thread will devolve into a devin style volt-amp posts. So we can take it private if you want to get into the math. Promise I am good with physics and won't take you on a wild goose chase.   

In case you misunderstood me, I'll say one thing though: notice that I didn't use the word "torque", but rather force. Where Tau=f*r

Assuming your motors have a constant efficiency over the whole rpm range, that's correct, however this example is misleading. @evoheyax is talking about "motors getting too hot" and here you imply same heat production but overlook heat dissipation, which doubles in your 4WD case.

Another way to see it is "you'll get at the same speed with both setups with the same battery, but second case will keep cooler motors". 
But no matter how you phrase it there will always be side cases where equivalent setups become better or worse, mostly because the temperature depends on :

1. heat dissipation which is function of surface, speed, and a small correction factor k*rpm 

2. other thermal factors that will systematically be overlooked as thermal conductivity of the truck/axle/bearings/connection to the wheel, and heat capacity of all these elements you're slowly cooking - that is likely a happy mix of various metals and thermoplastic polymers covered by a fine dust or a heavy mud layer :-D

Finally. Someone who understands. Yep, you are right. The 4WD will actually run cooler because it has more surface area & heat sinking mass. 

When you say misleading, it's quite the opposite. Isn't it? I was making a case for 4WD and didn't show everything that's in favour. :smiley:

Since you want so bad to have them with pneumatics, please be the test subject to statorade 😁

My bet is that the effect will be big, it won’t solve the consumption problem, but will increase the heat dissipation capacity

We have the same problem as ebike hubs motors. The only direct path for the heat to escape is the axle, and even then we don’t have much surface area to dissipate the heat on the hanger

We can build a big direct drive, but once everything is heat soaked it doesn’t matter

I will have more numbers to back that soon, figuring out how much heat can be transferred by the air gap to the can, and then doing the same thing with statorade

The Km of the motor which tells heat to torque relation is regardless of kv or kt so the kv doesn’t matter as far as efficiency in the motor n heat produced.   u would need a higher current controller to do the higher amps needed for a high kv motor to get the same torque but as long as has the same amount of wire would be same km

With the double long lever of the pneumatic wheel it will need double the ft/lbs from the motor for same output at wheel and 4 motors would do and then could rid of heat easier.   

The grin tech motor simulator incorporates the whole system and shows running a high kv is inefficient but I guess that inefficiency happens in the esc n wiring only.

Here’s the ‘Bajaboard’ style suspension, btw. This one will be a de facto standard in 2020 yet you can expect the smaller vendors to all start selling this in two months or so. 

And yes, we have a couple of similar drivetrains incoming for science. 6 weeks or so. 

I can tell you right now they’re junk - yet I can also predict that one of us will CNC a precision version of these trucks and they will be amazing. 

I still owe Winfly and Sofu parts on the Lofty; my real life work took precedence this week. 

It also appears that 90 MM is where our brakes are, per China. Curious if the Boas make a difference; no word yet on how the Baconators brake. They have an AWD ESC in production, no deets provided. 

If brakes are 90 MM or nothing, it’s hardly the end of the world.  I already love their thane. 

I’m just curious how brakes will play out with the other, larger Lofty wheel choices and AWD. That seems to me where they are headed. 

If I had to guess, their AWD Carbon would be $1999. 

Hope this helps!

that's not the problem. It's full short these motors seem to not be very strong as of now, unless it's actually a unity issue. I haven't hand spun them yet and haven't compared them to the TBDD yet.

I will say, if eLofty wants people to use them for high power applications, they really need to increase the gauge of the phase wires. They're incredibly thin and every time I throttle hard I worried about wires getting too hot and melting the rubber around them...

whats interesting is that. when I had my Hyperbeast working with the Raptor hub, unity and nano remote, it soft breaks at low rpm if I calibrate the nano correctly. If I forget to calibrate the remote and break, it perhaps clips under the lower bound of the pwm signal and I can definitely feel stronger break. that's why I suspect it's an unity issue. I'll bring over my dual ESCape for testing.

@sofu, I tried the current (not current-no-reverse-with-brake) mode and braking is as strong as you want it to be. Even on a downward slope. Give it shot. The issue is that if you keep braking even after it has come to rest you start going backward. Haha.  

@trampa, has there been any discussion regarding addition of a control mode mode where a reverse current can be applied to brake harder but still not go into reverse? That would give much stronger brakes to these direct drives and hub motors.

Then it's more of a VESC firmware issue. What you describe is a normal effect that any motor will show to some extent, for instance if you short the phases of a running motor you'll get less and less counter-torque as the rpm goes down. It doesnt matter if you have gears or a belt drive system, because the motor is still turning fast enough until you reach a speed low enough to consider that you can step on the ground. But if you turn it slowly enough, any shorted motor will become extremely easy to rotate.

So what you need in order to get a more or less linear decceleration until you stop is to have the VESC shift from regenerative braking to active braking (what is the VESC "backwards mode") under a pre-set rpm (typically when you switch to sensored mode) but you want to backwards mode to stop before you actually start moving backwards. Ideally the VESC would then shift to an active "stationary mode", keeping a low current flowing to stabilize the wheels in a fixed position until you release the remote's brake. This is the same kind of modification that has been implemented on Ackmaniac's firmware version, but with a slightly different algorithm.
This would be a super cool feature actually.. 
Couldn't anyone just find a way to blackmail Ackmaniac or something? :yum:

Yes have been using Ackmaniac's firmware for 1 year before switch to Unity and indeed if you use braking with reverse in his firmware you have ti fully stops then release breaking and engage braking again to go reverse. Thst was made to prevent undesired backwards movement and as result you could also stop and lock your wheels actually. Pretty fun. We should ask @Deodand to do the same and maybe make a mode where reverse is not enable but use same principle to stop at low speed under a certain low erpm.

I don't have problem as it is now but lo king the wheels ai would like to do same time just for fun. Now I have to press quite hard to achieve a bit of sliding

Don't have it working atm. I did rebuild a test bench battery to replace the dead battery it has atm and still need to install the BMS to get it working.

As for the SR Pepe, we don't have them and they are 90mms. I can put on some Popocas to check the ground clearance for you but most likely not desirable. Also given that these DD are 60 kv, you can only hit 30mph on 12S with 110. It will be even slower with smaller wheels.

So it works fairly well. I set the min eRPM to  -500 and so I can still brake hard on a downward slope and have it stop immediately but after stopping it starts climbing back at a very slow pace. Of course this is if you are not paying attention. If you are paying attention, you just let go off the trigger when it first comes to stop. 

Ideally I would like it to not go backward so I set the erpm to -100 and it made bad cogging sound. So I prefer -500eRPM to -100eRPM.

As pointed by Lucifer above, there are 18 stator poles. So magnets is probably 20(can't be 18). When I fixed that the distance now is very close to 3.2km and  it's what's reported by my other esk8.

I don't even have a wire for temperature. It's something we must ask them to implement.

EDIT: Just talked to Kenna. She said people can request for temperature sensor when placing the order and they have motors with integrated sensors ready. 

Also, she confirmed that they have 20 Magnets and that she thought I was asking about stator poles.

We love new builders, welcome. The answer to your question is yes, most likely.  Performance on 10S2P may be a bit underwhelming yet it should work, provided the connector on the battery works with the ESC (and it should).

I have run them on a 10s2p Meepo Sanyo and a few LingYi ESC variants and it amounted to a substantial upgrade over budget board hubs. Perfectly happy with them in that application, in fact. 

Not sure how the HW ESC will fare, but should be OK as @topcloud says.

For wheels, if you can find a set of 100mm Boa Constrictors, they would be ideal from a clearance standpoint without losing too much torque. 

The DDs will also offer increased performance later if you upgrade to a bigger battery and VESC.

But eLofty has 20 magnets vs 28(?) for TBDD. I wonder if they are same size magnets and what the role is for the final torque.

@rey8801, after updating the number of magnets to 20 I am getting a KV of 53 rpm/volt.( The wrong count of 18 gave me 60KV)

I wouldn't say 90kv is too high. I didn't push harder than 50% throttle and it was already plenty powerful. I'm sure TB DD are way better build than the elofty.

if i buy the kit with the ESC then i guess that will be okay? that only thing that i will reuse from my wowgo is the battery and the enclosures.

You don't need the ESC, as it's essentially the same as your current one. And 80mm wheels will be roughly the same size as the motor cans, so doubt that will work out for you. IMHO, 90mm would be the starting point.

To be fair, I don't think the guy _needs_ to know all the ins and outs and intricate details about how each and every part works. He rides a lot of boards, and at the end of the day, what matters is which one he likes to ride. I don't watch him enough to know if he's spreading any misinformation, but as long as he's not doing that, I don't see any reason to hate on him.

Agreed with @landonkun. regardless of his building experience and any past discrepancies in his info, I think there are still some good takeaways shown in the video.
-speed vs the evolve.
-hill climb ability vs his evolve.
-low temps after long hill climb
-battery life
-another voice of caution with 90mm wheels on DDs
-presale builds starting at 790+shipping

With very little footage of these DDs out there, i'm just happy to see more info, reviews, and hear there are options and possibly better prices because of it haha!

I would be a bit cautious about the anti-spark though. The good thing (well is it?) is that you might be able to bypass the anti-spark module and all its functions, and use a good old loopkey or a properly designed anti-spark module.
but sure they have dubbled the mosfets and put them in parallell compared to the regular dual 4.20, so it will be very capable current wise.
not sure about the SMD soldered caps either, have heard mixed thoughts regarding vibration. so you might have to end up securing them with some silicone.

Flipsky sent over two units for me and @Gamer43 to test out so more on that will come, might take a little while though as the package is still in china and I'm balls deep in other stuff

Group buy update.

Pricing is almost final; big thanks to @Winfly and Kenna at Lofty for hammering it out.

We're doing this 'group buy' a little differently; we've pre-negotiated a volume discount for you all, with direct purchase and direct fufillment.  No delays between you and your stuff.

This means the buyer will simply order and pay Lofty directly via Kenna, and, you'll receive your product directly from Lofty, just like magic. :woman_mage:  We'll ask any other participating vendor to do the same.

Finally, in full disclosure, there is no markup, rebate, eval units or anything on the back-end of this deal.  We're buying at the same price as everyone else, of course.  One tribe.

Lofty is a 'prosumer' level product so please don't expect Carvon SDR or TB DD.  One bundle we're putting together is to help Meepo, Ownboard, etc. owners replace their hubs with axials.  Lofty's 90 MM Loftythane is simply in another dimension when compared to any 90 MM hub drivetrain.

We'll make a new thread and post it tomorrow, hopefully with our team discount and a Google signup sheet, so Kenna can reach buyers directly.

Thanks team :)

That's exciting!

I was actually _just_ e-mailing someone at Crownwheel, who quoted me at $249 + $135USD shipping for a "sample" of the set with motors, DKP (with baseplate) and wheels.

There wasn't much price difference when I asked about a set of 10, although I assume you would save some on shipping if it was all shipped to one destination first.

That already puts it at $90 cheaper than what elofty currently has listed on their ebay page for the same set.

I'm hoping that @topcloud got us a deal as good as this one (no pressure) :D haha

Possibly gearing, but I bet the ESC in that board is just worse than my dual focboxes in terms of power delivery. It was pretty similar in performance to the Evolve GT so I doubt the motors are being used to their full potential.

So far, I like this product.

If I'm forced to say, I felt that top speed is slow even though it is 75kv. (My test build is a 97mm wheel and 10S battery setting.)

because the actual kv value is 56kv, as reported by @Tetsu and @mishrasubhransu.
However, low kv motors match well with large diameter wheels and pneumatic settings.

Well, I'm now planning to make a 12S battery. :crazy_face:

Hey @landonkun, did they say anything about when they can ship and in what quantity. 

Also there is some additional information that the crownwheel might not be the same as eLofty. Apparently Crownwheel developed their own. We don't know the accuracy of the information, so any additional information would help.

Nice. Which baseplate is that in your picture? So if I understand this thread the limitations are that we can't get this in RKP and we can't use ABEC11 wheels? 

So it's either DKP or TKP(source your own baseplate) and kegel core wheels only?

It's a baseplate of the Elofty DKP truck. 

Your understanding is correct. So far, Chinese Axial DD has no RKP. And only kegel core.
If you want RKP DD, the Torque Board DD is your only choice.

Yeah, I ordered the TB DD but giving up on it for a few reasons.

How did you convert from DKP to TKP with the DKP truck? Did you just remove the the "dual" part of  the truck (part that goes between the baseplate and the hanger) and everything fit?

Edit: looking at this image I think that makes sense
![image|212x499](upload://mfHt1dd9OapE1expGg0hoHYChy8.jpeg) 

Now I just need to figure out the implications of using TKP instead of RKP (never ridden TKP before)

Team,

After many hours of negotiations, @Winfly has successfully negotiated community discounts with Lofty Shenzhen, for all our builders.  Thank you, Wing and Kenna.  In summary:

* We have tiered pricing; the more the community buys, the less we all pay;
* We will start at (30) qty. pricing for the forum (thank you Kenna);
* If we go past (30) paid orders, you will receive a credit from Lofty for the difference towards any other item in the builder's catalog;
* Orders will be placed directly with Lofty;
* Payments will be sent directly to Lofty, and;
* Prices include shipping to your door from (you guessed it) from Lofty. :slight_smile:
* If the quality is good, we will repeat this offer every 3 months.

New-in: **P-MODS**.  Lofty makes batteries and offered 4p and 5p configs; instead, **we asked Lofty to build us **P modules** that all builders could stitch together and use in all enclosures.**  Project lead: @Winfly 

Sourcing quality, durable "P-Modules" is our next priority, to help all builders.

Next-up: **LUNAR 100 MMs**.  Lofty can get a mould made up based on their 90 MM Kegel wheel, which is outstanding in quality and juice.  Look for our review of the 90 MMs soon.

We are waiting on pricing for these wheels.  Wheels will have significant up-front costs, so lead @topcloud 

**We're closing this deal and committing to Lofty :)** with great thanks to the other two manufacturers that reached out.  We will be organizing more of these in the very near future.

1. We'll post a builder's catalog with builder's tiered pricing; you all will get to see the tiers; 
2. Buyers fill out a form selecting what they'd like, add contact infomation, and;
3. Kenna reaches out to you directly, to process your orders.  Everything ships immediately DHL.

Be back tomorrow.  Safe riding today.

**EDIT: if any manufacturer has a deck they'd like to drop-in to this Builder's Buy at a 15-25% discount, please let us know.**
```

To add to that news, my contact at Crownwheel ignored all my questions about motor details. The only question he chose to answer was that we can buy up to 10 sets. I think it's safe to say elofty actually cares more about our needs and not just our business.

Eager to hear the pricing of these discounts :slight_smile:

I'm also wondering if they can figure out some better shipping options for us? It'd be great to get something like DHL or at least speedpak, rather than the "economy shipping" on their eBay that could take weeks.

Awesome! Great to hear the update, @topcloud! 
So what is the order of operations at the moment?? Does the community wait to see what Lofty presents for tiered pricing first? or does the community have to sign up first and in order for her to present the pricing?

If we knew the numbers first, (and it was significant in savings).. it could spur the community to jump on board sooner. What do you think?

Can we present her with conceptual head count to see what the different tiers could be?
If 10 people are in on DD orders by mid May, how much % off of current price? 
If 20... how much off?
etc..

Team, thank you,

We will post the pricing tomorrow on a Google form.

To set expectations; negotiated discounts are in-line with "builder's discounts" that we've seen from other companies.

The difference here is that Lofty drives are already priced direct-from-factory on eBay.

The additional discount is to help introduce a brand - Lofty Shenzhen - as a potential new and trusted partner to you, our community.  Prices include DHL shipping to your door.  We're trying to keep this as frictionless as possible.

Everyone gets a chance to deal directly with the manufacturer.  

Nobody stands between you, and your vision, any longer.

If you buy these drives, we just ask for one thing: please, post your builds.  Spark ideas and invent things, or do like FabTrav and resell Loftys with your own brand on it - you can Indiegogo the next Evolve instead of patching up the last one, right here.

We charge ahead, together.  Thanks team. :)

friends: awaiting confirmation on our starting position in the Indie Builder's discount; will update today.

Here's an example of what to expect:

**Lofty 2WD Double Kingpin Direct-Drive, front and rear DKP trucks (complete) with Lofty 90 MM Stratus wheels:**

* Retail 2019: **$499** (DKP drivetrain, F/R, with wheels)
* Direct from Lofty, on eBay, with shipping included: **$459 shipped direct (right now)**
* Starting Indie Builder's Catalog price for you: **$429 shipped direct (limit 2 drivetrains, or 1 AWD)**
* Best Indie Builder's Catalog price for you, in volume: **$407 shipped direct**

...and because we have been asked this question about a hundred times:

Yes, the Lofty AWD option that includes (4) 90 MM wheels will cost less than the TB DD dual, without wheels.  This is not an endorsement.

We've done the hard part and pre-negotiated small-volume discounts, in Mandarin, direct with the manufacturer, for our Indie Builder community.

This means, if any of you would like to run a small Indiegogo with Lofty for 30 AWD Lofty drivetrains and put them on @Eboosted Sector 9 Bintangs, all that's standing between you and glory is hard work.

Or, go big and design a new drop-through deck of your own that Lofty manufactures in qty 100. and launch your Indiegogo with backercamp.com and push the industry forward.  If Dualomo can do it based on the Bustin Newsletter mailing list, any of you certainly can, too.

I want to thank everyone who's helped encourage and/or goad us into negotiating with Lofty, for the community.  @DAddYE @BillGordon and @esk8jpn, thanks for your pioneering spirit, you set the bar for us all.   

Special thanks to those who spent personal time and weekends negotiating with a Chinese supplier for zero financial benefit, and of course, to the Lofty customers who are testing and sharing information with our community: thank you, @mishrasubhransu @sofu and @Winfly.
 
We'll post the Lofty Indie Builder's Price Book later today.  By the way, if you guys think this is dope, let us know below.  

The hardest part for the Western startup entrepeneur is finding and selecting the right Asian suppliers, and we're considering opening up new suppliers as we move forward, together.  Thanks team.

How does one go about calculating top speed with this drive? Does this make sense: http://calc.esk8.it/#{%22batt-type-lipo%22:1,%22batt-cells%22:10,%22motor-kv%22:56,%22system-efficiency%22:85,%22motor-pulley-teeth%22:1,%22wheel-pulley-teeth%22:1,%22wheel-size%22:90}|

85% efficiency usually work out well for me on belt drivetrains. According to the above, on a 10s system with the 90mm wheels top speed would be only 29.88 km/h.

58(rpm/volts)\*42(volts)\*3.14\*90mm/60sec = 11473mm/sec = 41km/hr = 25.6mph

My assumption is that by defaulting to DKP trucks, they have moved the motor away from the deck. There is no chance of the motors touching the deck while turning. But then again TB DD works fine, so :man_shrugging:

BTW, the can diameter is 67mm.

Kenna said to me on whatsapp just a minute ago, 
_"the motor is 58kv each - so we write 75kv for two"_ 

(i don't understand the math on that) 

She also did say that the website may be updated with the kv numbers. But the ebay listing probably still says 75. 

Regarding speed, Kenna also said:

"_58kv we take the 10s4p battery that the speed could be 45km/h (27 mph) _
_if you take 12s4p that speed could meet 60km/h (37 mph)_ _This is using Vesc 4.2"_

Are you worried about top speed? You can simulate [here](https://calc.3dservisas.eu/).

I think the scrutiny here is warranted (A lot of early confusion around the KV and some conflicting reports of the performance) and the disappointment is to be expected (Everyone wants a DD, specially one that is cheap and early on this had promise). 
I remember earlier in the thread @Touch415 was being very real about the performance and he was met with some resistance

Someone should do a Summary of the DD so people know what to expect. The info I can add:

At **56KV**...
*(According to the calculator that is spot on for me on belt driven systems)*
- Top speed with 10s and 90mm (eLofty) wheels: [18.06 mph - 29.07 km/h](http://calc.esk8.it/#{%22batt-type-lipo%22:0,%22batt-cells%22:10,%22motor-kv%22:56,%22system-efficiency%22:85,%22motor-pulley-teeth%22:1,%22wheel-pulley-teeth%22:1,%22wheel-size%22:90}|)

- Top speed with 10s and 147mm(e.g.: Bergmeister size) wheels: [29.5 mph - 47.48 km/h](http://calc.esk8.it/#{%22batt-type-lipo%22:0,%22batt-cells%22:10,%22motor-kv%22:56,%22system-efficiency%22:85,%22motor-pulley-teeth%22:1,%22wheel-pulley-teeth%22:1,%22wheel-size%22:147}|)
- Top speed with 12s and 147mm(e.g.: Bergmeister size) wheels: [35.4 mph - 56.98 km/h](http://calc.esk8.it/#{%22batt-type-lipo%22:0,%22batt-cells%22:12,%22motor-kv%22:56,%22system-efficiency%22:85,%22motor-pulley-teeth%22:1,%22wheel-pulley-teeth%22:1,%22wheel-size%22:147}|)


DD is **DKP** only which by can be converted into TKP by removing the middle piece. RKP is the more common truck style used in e-skates. There are only pulleys for Kegel core (no ABEC11)

Or just that you like to ride at a lower speed in general. The upside is that you get more torque for hill climbing.

Personally I’m not interested in these DDs but for all of those who want some decent top speed and torque I’d recommend waiting for the real 75kv ones   As for testing goes @Winfly if I were you I would keep riding the set you already have and reporting back to the community.   See I don’t understand how you can call yourself a “tester” when all you have done so far is ride them for a few miles then quit on them!!   Why is that!?   Do you have too many things that you need to test at the moment!? Well. If that’s the case pass them on to someone else who can do some real testing and start feeding information back to the community who is actually interested in them     Just saying

No need to worry so much about these DDs. Clearly they're not for you. We can tag you if/when the 75kv version comes around.

Me? I live in the flattest city ever, and will be rocking 97 to 105mm wheels, so these are perfect for me.

I need to go out and cruise around casually and check my speed to see how i really ride before making a decision I think. Maybe I drive slower than I think I do. I started on electric unicycles so I'm used to 26-30mph being my regular cruising speed for rides. On a board that same speed feels much faster.

With 10s2p sanyo battery, DD, nummies, there will be no range or off road due to battery sag and esc low amperage. Most likely your range is going to be worst.

Nice! I can update the model based on whether it will be machined or casted-and-machined. 

3 spoke version will make it lighter. We can consider that if the machining cost is not a lot higher. Because more material will be removed in 3 spoke version.

So I just did a series of speed tests with the following setup:

Board:

1st gen eLofty DD 

Diyeboard 4-speed esc/remote in 4TH GEAR BABY! 

10s2p Sanyo

TB 110 wheels 

Single hairless Malibu barbie duct-taped on front 


Rider:

6'3" (I'm a great wind screen) 

225 lbs

Male chastity belt with Touch 'n Tell LED warning lights


Data according to GPS Trip Tracker app:

Highest speed: 23.1 mph

Highest speed easily maintained and held: 22.5 mph

Not blazing fast, but enough to pull away from a turgid and lubed-up @Brenternet on foot, and that's my only real need/concern.

Plenty for me, especially given the official speed limits where I live. I'm not in a situation where I can hit 30-35 and expect to keep my board. Well, that and the fact that I'm a little sissy boy with perpetually moist undie fronts.

Hills are no problem whatsoever, and I still love the ride I get from the smooth power delivery, wide stance, and the TB 110s. 

Easily the best esk8 purchase I've ever made.

@Grozniy @ricardo
To be accurate, I bought a 6inch tire and tube. These were released with the GTR.
But hubs only sell one kind(for GT, GTR). This means that both 7inch and 6inch tires should work on the same hub. 

I don't have Trampa and Mbs hub, so I don't know if they fit.

From Evolve's website :
 
"The Evolve 6” wheel is best for poor quality roads and footpaths and small amounts of grass areas. **It has slightly less torque than the 7" tyres.**"

How does a 6" tire have less torque than a 7"? Is this some sort of Australian physics reversal that only happens in the southern hemisphere? :rofl: They say you have to use their AT kit, and I assume the same hubs and pulleys. So, is this just another blatantly false and outrageous claim made by Evole?

Definitely not the cleanest job, and impossible to test without owning the wheel, but I did the best I could with the tools I have.

Will require supports within the model for a couple spots, but should be easy to take out afterwards.

I assume this part doesn't hold the actual bearing, right? Cause I didn't design it in such a way.

Was thinking about my urethane wheel options for these when I get them and wondered, there aren't really any kegel style clones huh? I'm looking for 100-110mm wheels but I don't think there are any options with kegel cores that are less than $100 correct?

His adapter for Haggy works well too, But you’ve to make sure the axel length from the hangar is the same from both sides.

Wow, that's awesome! I'm very happy that it worked out for you. Especially since it's something I kinda just whipped together without being able to test it myself :slight_smile:

Update: The insurance company got back to me today finally and said that they will reimburse me for my damages. They just need me to send them the receipts.

She said she was late for church and left. Didn’t give me any insurance information. I called 911 and gave her license plate. Someone was supposed to come but I waited for 45 mins and then left. I’ll contact her insurance, given I have her on video discussing the incidence.

Edit: I have her insurance information now, let’s see how it goes with her insurance company.

I just saw it. Especially nice to have the braking issue addressed and the fix for it. Great job.

The motor amp limit isn’t a hard limit and as long as the motors don’t get to some unknown temp that would demagnetize the magnets should be fine moving motor amps up.  The magnets could be demagnetized in one quick swoop at low temps if exposed to a strong enough field from the stator i guess but unlikely.

Hi.  I have currently just ordered the lofty with the double Kingpin 56 kv/ 77kv when using dual Drive which is the minimum DD Max which is pretty powerful and have 63 mm Motors.  I also have the focbox UNITY (new version) with the DD R SPEC drive from Enertion (Raptor 2.1).  My only dream is if the R-Spec Drive would have a wider wheel base longer truck width.. with the liquid cooled motor I love the power but would love to make some major changes... But if someone could please tell me what they think is the best between the two I currently have and the other 2 DD's Mentioned above.  One was from TORQUE BOARDS... And the other I have not ever heard of but we will be looking at today.
