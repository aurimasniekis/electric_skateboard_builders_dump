Soldering iron or hot air station touching it by a mistake.

All my XT connecters looks like it due to that.

on the plastic? it probably got burned when the hot air from the DRV replacement hit it. It shouldn't affect performance.

That is a REALLY messy job on the phase wire plugs. I'd be more worried about that.

Never solder the bullet connectors directly to the PCB, enertion did this with the Raptor 1 and they always break off the PCB over time. Always use a silicone wire

A vesc follow up. Everything is disconected now, but I think you will see how it all was done, the left vesc's dvr burned THE SECOND i pluged it in. the wires to the xt90 were resoldered, could have I mess up the capacitors? I had a Canbus at the moment, the vesc on the right is not conecting to the Pc, pc plays a sound, once I plug the USB, but the vesc app do not see the vesc. What is wrong with all this system?? Is it worth fixing it? I'm on the edge just buying the dual flipsky 6,6 vesc.![41106023_819803691694986_1716545948282257408_n|666x500](upload://51pjmxsujhjeBgIs8NNKQ5v0jhN.jpg)

What happened with your phase wires on the left vesc. Why one of the cables lose?

About the connection. Does the vesc power on?
There are some blue/red leds flashing?
If yes, did you choose the right com port in the vesc tool?

Phase wires are simply soldered off now. Only the blue and green.
