We have a lot of info in different threads about different 18650 batteries and i´d like to start a thread where you can talk about why you choose exactly that specific cell and help others decide which cells to use.

* LG HE2 2500mAh - 20A
* LG HE4 2500mAh - 20A
* LG HG2 3000mAh - 20A
* SAMSUNG 30q 3000mah - 15A
* SAMSUNG 25R 2500mAh - 20A
* Sony VTC5 2600mAh - 30A
* Sony VTC6 3000mAh - 30A

I think these are the common ones. For example @chaka is using HE4 i think?! And esk8.de @elkick wants to switch to VTC5 in the future because of better lifecycles?!

So throw your batterys in here and let us know why you choose or will choose it :slight_smile:

@TarzanHBK I use:

[quote="TarzanHBK, post:1, topic:11015"]
SAMSUNG 25R 2500mAh - 20A
[/quote]

They were easy to access via a group buy and spares are readily available on Amazon. Many forum members have used them so there was some additional assurance that they were useful in esk8 applications. Sometimes the voltage on arrival varies, but it's always between 3.5V-3.7V and I've never received a "dud cell."

Samsung 30q 3000mah is rated at 15 amps by the manufacturer but performs as well as 20 amp cells.

I personally use:
LG MJ1 3500mAh 10A (https://eu.nkon.nl/lg-inr18650-mj1.html)

High capacity, but lower max discharge rate of 10A compared to what people usually use as the minimal of 20A.

http://i.imgur.com/WtBYz2P.jpg

I get 18 miles of range with 20 of them, although with a low kV motor, 19/30 gearing and 4S5P my max flat speed is 12 mph.

Nkon is a pretty good place to get Li-Ion cells by consumers in the EU area.

yah its a bit different. Here you go:

"Sony does not want consumers using their cells. It doesn't make any sense that Sony would just abruptly exit a lucrative business making 18650 cells for industrial use. Their cells were never meant to be used directly by the end consumer and for this reason they have drastically cut the number of companies/manufacturers they sell to and therefore currently only sell to very large manufacturers of battery packs (laptops, drills, power banks, OEM use, etc). Because of this, there are fewer and fewer suppliers/distributors who can get their hands on the legitimate Sony cells and sell them abroad."

I drew the board's two pieces in 2D CAD and then figured out the size of the recesses by measuring the cells and electronics with a caliper. I then had them CNC routed and milled by a local company with me providing the 15 mm birch plywood for material.

The board does have a little bit of flex, but with me at 80 kg and with my wide stance and feet near the trucks it doesn't pose a problem. I did however take a note of the flex when my taller and heavier friend got on it, with his feet closer to the center how much the flex was due to his larger weight and narrower stance.

I'm planning to adjust the geometry of the pieces a little bit to provide a bit more support and lessen the flex.

Ive been hearing great things about the VTC 5A, from what i understand Sony took the VTC5 and tweaked the chemistry so they perform better in cordless vacuums. I would love to try a pack of these but there a little too expensive for me.

Vtc6 batteries do not deliver the rated performance. Actually they are not even better than HG2 cells. So no need to pay the higher price just for the sony name.

Edit: i posted a discharge curve some time ago when they were brand new and I wanted to show them to @whitepony

I cannot post my research but it usually falls right in line with what Henrik has on his site. 

VTC6 vs HG2 @5A

VTC6 vs HG2 @10A

VTC6 vs HG2 @15A

E:upped fixed images. 
As you can see, VTC6 have not only more Ah, but also less voltage sag, which turns into a nice gain in energy.
E2: @5A its roughly a gain of 0.8Wh/cell or 8.5% and it only gets better as your power draw gets higher.

I see different measurements when I look online:

The difference is only marginal
Also they warn about the temperature increase. The Sony got to 85°C at the end of the discharge - that is quite high.

In this 30A discharge test they even had to abort the test because the temperature of the VTC6 increased to >99°C.

I am a big fan of the Samsung 30Q. They only have a little bit less performance than the VTC6 but cost only 66%. At https://eu.nkon.nl/sony-us18650vtc6.html you get the VTC6 for 5.85€ for 50 and the Samsung 30Q https://eu.nkon.nl/samsung-inr-18650-30q-3000mah.html for 3.90€ for 50.

also the problem with the VTC6 is that they seem to have a bad cycle life. Should mean they perform great when they are new and after like 25 charge cycles they are not better than a HG2 anymore.
http://www.mountainprophet.de/2016/07/22/eine-stichprobe-cyclelife-test-sony-vtc6-vs-lg-hg2/

Here is the discharge curve to compare Sony VTC6 to Samsung 30Q.

I'm not sure what his methods are. Henrik details his methods on his website and his results usually match my own test results using an iCharger duo 4010with temp sensors in a large temperature controlled room. I say usually because I am in bed and cannot confirm that the curves matched in my tests (I did them a few months ago).

Problem with 30Q is that since they are only rated at 15A their performance could change from batch to batch.
The current tests show that the batches so far are capable of much more - but that does not have to stay this way.

I kinda want to cycle the cells I have now until they have 40-50 cycles and test again. I usually don't do this since for my work purposes, they're a one time disposable use cell... (Can you believe there are no primary lithium cells that are more energy dense?!? (In volume))

Shamefully, they're tied to a government contract so we have to store them in our back shop in case they come knocking on the door for everything once the project is finished.

Plus theyre all welded in massive burly packs. Maybe good for ebikes, definitely no good for eskate

Hi guys, 
any update ? 
I would like to build a 10S3P for my eskate. 

should I use Samsung 30Q - LG HG2 - LG HE4  or Sony VTC6 ... 
3Ah is geat (VS 2.5) but I would like a good quality .. 

thanks !

I don't have any graphs or anything, but I can tell you this--using them in mech mods for vaping (the type with no chips or regulation, just an atomizer directly connected to the battery controlled by the ohms of the coils you build: lower ohms=faster battery drain and more amps pulled), and I can tell you this; I've used all the batteries discussed here besides eFest (all the major brands, Samsung, LG, Sony) and by FAR the Sonys light these things up the fastest and with the most power. They're the best by far. Samsung's are good, for sure, then the LG's, but the Sonys come closest to having the actual current amperage as advertised. The others? Sometimes I think they pick a number between the constant current and surge amps and try passing it off. I don't have the links but I've seen the numbers and tests done on YouTube. But that's direct battery to device, I don't think you can get a better guage than that. Anyway, that's my two cents ;-)

I don't see how or why nobody goes for A123  cells. Yes they are a little bigger being a 26650 size cell but the benefits of discharge and fire safety seem to be the best. Also you can build smaller packs.

Lame excuse. Same with 30q's
 So how much does it cost when your board catches fire.Seem like packs could be half as big to get the same discharge.  A group buy could get em down to 6.00 while the 30q's are 3.50 each.

I considered the A123 cells, but they're bigger for the same capacity. basically the energy stored in the same space is reduced enough that it's not worth it. I think there's also a nominal voltage drop too.
