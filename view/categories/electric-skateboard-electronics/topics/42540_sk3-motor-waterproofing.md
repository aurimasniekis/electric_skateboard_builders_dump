Hi guys, I’m working on my first build and I noticed that my sk3 has very big holes  on the motor. I was wondering if there is anyways to make that area more protected from small rocks or water. This is what I’m talking about,<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/2/a2edef6c48cb2732b06c4188f9aaadb1842651c7.jpeg" width="494" height="500"> . Please leave suggestions below.

Outrunner motors are inherintly water proof by design.   as for protection, it depends on what you have at hand.  if you have a 3d printer, thats super easy.  if not,   get a hotglueGun/adhesive and some mesh and glue it onto the end so nothing can get in.  there are some good images on the forum somewhere, but either way, ive been running without protection for half a year now without problems.

A.) Can use wire mesh and use those 4 bolt holes to attach to.
I saw a really nice mod by a forum member and it was also for a SK3, (and I just scrolled through all my replies to find that but can't :( )

B.) You can make a 3D printed cover for it. 
What kind of sk3 is that?
Maybe in this thread >> 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motor-protection-enclosure-shield/10162
Actually I have some CAD drawings for 63XX's.

Key thing to point out is that those vent openings actually help cool down the motor. Depending on what type of SK3 it is, it has a ram fan in the front portion behind the axle output.

I had planned on adding protection for the motor but decided it wasn't necessary.  I was wrong...

I also added transparent heat resistant and vibration resistant glue around the edge, because in those areas around the edge of motor between screws- mesh was lifting up a bit.

Nothing rubbing, it is fine. Also check your windings, on sk3 they not so good, i had a lot loose windings inside, they would rub from vibrations and lead to short. So then you need find some lacquer for windigs that can hold heat and ad few layers to glue them in place. I used this stuff on windings and magnets too, my friend using it for years for his e bikes. This stuff works like a charm:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/3/63f171437d8494b51579d665a2d71ceee21c5f5c.png" width="690" height="388">

 I also experimented with this silicon type glue (bison-max repair), hight temp- same glue i was using to glue edges of mesh to motor. But its still in beta for me. Because I need more time proof that this silicon has no cemical reaction with copper in windings. But for now no issues 200km, no overheating, no cemical reaction, holds windings in place:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/3/e3d1efce232b6f013fce96df52ddb68bc56d1d4f.png" width="281" height="500">

And one more thing- to make sk3 really good you need 4 things:
1. silicon cable mod
2. mesh on holes
3. glue together loose windings
4. replace bearings to better ones (i use skf bearings- they costed me about 20eur total. but except big bearing that is for inner fan- that one alone cost 27eur :scream:.)

I also took out that inner fan, because i f***ed it up when tried to open motor. Also it is useless and replacing bearings that bich can make it worthless(too expensive bearing for that fan).

almost no outrunners we use are supported on the shaft side except this sk3 and he just took it out.  they're all floating bells supported at the other side with the shaft in the middle only
I like the gluing of the wires but the glue is so thick and will make the motor hotter and therefore get worse efficiency and you only get part of the windings coated and maybe there are unknown loose wires vibrating around you miss.

Thats why you use epoxy, its fluid (high viscosity), goes in every tiny slot. And its better thermal conductor than air. Just don't make a 5mm thick seal^^ 0.5 to 1 mill is all you need. Indestructable then, magnets can still fuck up

Depends what epoxy you use. Theirs a motor winding epoxy that hummie was able to get a sample of that worked very well. Ideally, you want as thin of a layer of epoxy on the windings as possible. It's very possible the factory could be doing an ok job on this dipping, which will lead to problems for us due to the high vibrations.

Too much epoxy and your just insulating the motors, as hummie said.

Even the worst epoxy is better thermal conductor than air. Too much epoxy and your bell wont spin anymore. Factory does no dipping, wires are enamel coated thats all they do.

```
the lower the viscosity the thinner the resin
   On paper unfilled epoxy is close to the thermal conductivity of air but using even a highly filled and much more thermally conductive epoxy on windings it shows to hold more heat when I tried it.   Theres other materials besides epoxy that can hold windings, maybe not quite as well, but that have much better thermal conductivity.  The Tesla s car's windings are potted in something.
I bet if you wrapped the stator windings in thin copper foil and had that come out from under the motor bell you could get some great heat transfer.  It seems the heat is stuck on the copper windings only to be transferred through the air as the stator steel is not conductive being laminates of high silicone stuff and with insulation layers.  a block of steel in the oven vs a stator and the stator only gets warm and cant touch the true steel.  If you could put some 6awg copper leads on the motor and if it's possible to get some thermally conductive insulation on them instead of standard silicone theres a direct path to the source of most of the heat we produce.  Or multistrand leads that splay out into the passing air.

the point of transferring the heat being to lower the heat in the motor so as to have the winding resistance stay as low as possible (increases with heat), so to have better efficiency and range and also have the motor winding insulation last longer and also avoid whatever temp would reduce the magnetic strength of the magnets or even demagnetize them at high temps
https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html
potting of course being to hold the wires from vibrating and possibly shorting through each other or through the stator

If you are worried about stones and what not getting in the can; I’m designing fan covers that don’t extend the motors any longer then the shaft, and provide some added airflow for cooling I can share files once I finish a second iteration. I could just as easily make a solid cap if anyone wants that as well. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/c/3c3b6af05cd0ac55b1956612fb10c7e9e8a9357a.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/b/3be45aeadde0ddab19c4213c21484fa8986c3edf.jpg" width="666" height="500">

hard to tell what shape the blades are on that printed part but plain old radial and used to throw the air out is the way it wants to go.  Probably just upped the motor continuous output by at least a hundred watts

@Hummie I noticed how the sk3 6364 and 74 have the built in fan. So one side the Fan pushes the air out the back, and one fan sucks Air in the back (in a dual set up because they are spinning opposite ways). So I was going to design one fan like you said so it’ll pull air through, and the other one to have blades that suck Air in to aid the built in fan. Think that would be a good idea?

i didn't know those motors had a fan pulling and also pushing but I printed a couple different versions of forced air coolers similar to what you did and found if its spinning it will throw the air out radially.  that need not be an obstacle and with the right shaping of blades it could pull the air into and across the motor but it wont pull towards the center and centrifugal forces override a scoop trying to pull in.   so with your bladed blue fan above it would either throw air out successfully but trying to pull it in I doubt it would.
  a push and pull will work way better.  But a truly passive cooling method these aren't and current is lost just spinning the blades.  Not much and insignificant really but it will only work with high speed and at that high speed it takes the most energy.  ultimately I wonder how effective they really are.  I gave up on them in the end and rather try a truly passive cooling method
I'm trying to make some super thick motor leads with the most thermally conductive silicone insulation and see how that goes.  no losses in its use there.

@Hummie thanks for all of your experience and info.. I might just end up making a mesh cover to keep rocks out then. The best cooling method is probably just some thick aluminum mounts and thermal paste between the motor and the mounts...

turn down your volume please!  its so misleading because foc on the road is so quiet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSpycm1WjaY
looks very similar.  

testing with just my infrared thermometer didn't show much if any improvement.  made a bunch of designs that never really got a full test.  was disappointed in results generally.  but never added scoops.  just going bigger motors seems a better solution. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=46&v=DIXVtP9GAFE

but your  motor spins like 3x faster so could do more.

with the large amount of space inside the rotor of most outrunners  it would be nice to design an air sucker of some sort that connected on the inside of the motor and got .1mm off from the windings.  a turbine on the inside with many blades blowing out the holes.  with a printer.  temp wouldn't be a problem. a clip on.  I don't have that motor and wont be making it but would if I was better at fusion.  would take me too long.  gotta watch more lars on youtube.

@Hummie thanks for sharing the videos.. I do wonder if the extra rpm on belt drives would provide more airflow. I’m not sure what blade designs would be best.. but looking at

I think it'd be easier to make some different designs and test them than to learn some program and for sure accurate.  If you can install a more accurate  mounted temp sensor instead of the infrared because it's so wild than it's just riding around a route.  
I think the ego motor has a fan on its outside.

But I like inside the motor and a snap on 3d print, maybe it's more efficient being on the inside than the out with the air it's contacting being only what its trying to move.  there's not much room inside but if it were to juuust fit that would be slick.  that's what I'd like to see.  

or maybe if the printer were good enough could make a mesh of blades with .5mm holes to screen out rocks.

Heres a new version of the fan cover. I made it so it has 30 backward curved blades as well as a second design with 52 blades. This is a rendering of how one looks. They just requires 4 3mm screws.

Just finalized the design. V2.2 is the one I would recommend for an Emtb or backwards mounted motors. It has the best airflow of any I have made, but it isn't as strong as the others.

@barajabali if you are standing behind the board when its resting on the wheels. When you print it you can verify in your cam software by seeing if the blades are angled backwards from the direction the motor will spin.  @wmj259 im not sure what you mean, like have it so the air will blow up the can of the motor?

Im talking about the motors that are mounted under the board, so they encounter a lot more road debris (curbs, rocks, sticks); I would feel safer personally with a stronger fan cover. However if your motors are mounted backwards and angled up  like on @barajabali 's mountainboard, then they will only encounter small debris so they don't need as strong of a fan. As of right now im satisfied with the current design for my use. If someone raises a good design idea though i'll change it.

Gotcha. Looks good.  My only request would be a combination of 2.1 and 2.2.  So the blade height of 2.2 combined with the "plate" thickness of 2.1 for added strength.  I use a single-drive, so length is not really a concern for me.  But the motor is mounted underneath in front of the rear truck and is subjected to more impacts (see image posted above where I broke a motor winding from an impact)

No worries if you don't have time. Look forward to printing this guy out!

 Its got a metal fan inside that spins with the can so it depends on what direction is spinning. 
So yeah.  On a standard dual setup one will be sucking in through the back and the other out

@barajabali @krloz 
The standard fans on these are flat blades that act as a centrifugal fan. Regardless of the way the fan spins, the flow is always outwards from the fins. 

Therefore the flow always comes in through the back and out the front regardless of direction the motor spins. 

E: I may be wrong. I'm looking at two different pictures and it seems like on one, the blades are flat but on the other that they have a slight curve.
This is important, as the flat blades would mean it is a centrifugal fan and the above applies but if the blades are curved then it ***might be*** axial fan which blows air in one direction, when reversed, the flow rate would be much lower and the fan would be a lot less efficient so I doubt this is the case but you never know!

This one had the same fan mine has. At 4.39 you can see the blades are flat but at an angle do they will push turning in one direction and pull turning on the other

Can the fan's orientation be flipped?  

My motor spins counterclockwise.  However after looking closer at the fan blades, a clockwise rotation would produce the best airflow

_Edit:  CCW vs CW depends on which side of the motor you are looking at. Mine is actually spinning CW, as viewed from the front of the motor_

Careful trying to analyze flow by the looks of a fan! It can be very deceiving and counter intuitive. 

The best way to determine flow on small scale is by using string or yarn held near the inlet and seeing which way it flows.

False. If you mount an **axial** fan backwards it will produce airflow when turned the other way otherwise we wouldn't have cw and ccw propellers in aviation. 

And an S upside down is an S...? Depends on your axis of rotation. Draw it on paper, and turn the paper upside down so that you are now looking at the back of the sheet and tell me what you see.

If this is the case, then I was right before and it is a centrifugal fan. If you want to experiment on which way it would be more efficient, you could spin the motor with no load forward at x rpm and measure the power draw, then do the same turning it in the opposite direction. 

If you post some high res pictures of the fan, I can help you in figuring out which way it should be mounted for higher efficiency based on shape, angle, and rotation direction

Clockwise appears to be slightly more efficient, based on torque/efficiency curves

What in hell are you talking about.  You can fill the conversation with a more technical language if you feel like it but you are wrong anyway.  A fan is not a 2d object painted in piece of paper.  If you turn it upside down you still have to respect the motor axis wick is the way it is mounted so you have to turn it 180° In whatever axis is normal to the motor axis.  And in that case the fans will be looking the same way.

Air flow is ***always*** out the front if it is a centrifugal fan as @jmasta observed regardless of motor rotation direction.


@krloz 
I got myself confused (as i said, this stuff can be a little counter intuitive sometimes) but my statement here still holds true:

[quote="PXSS, post:60, topic:42540"]
If you mount an axial fan backwards it will produce airflow when turned the other way
[/quote]

Look at the pictures you posted above. 
The first one (with the prop pointed to the right) has to rotate ccw when observed from the left (near blades moving up) to produce *airflow to the left*. 
The second (with prop pointed left) has to rotate cw (near blades going down) to produce *flow to the right*. 

This is because of the curvature of the blades and is the one of the basic fundamentals on how a prop works. 

***This conversation is meaningless if the fan is a centrifugal fan*** as centrifugal fans blow air radially and not axially

I still have a really hard time believing that they would put an axial fan inside a motor. It doesn't make sense at all.

Axial fan:
Rotation direction (cw or ccw) dictates which way the air flows. American blades are made so that when looking at them from behind, a clockwise rotation will blow air towards you. Spin it the opposite way (ccw) and it would blow air away from you ***but*** if you mount it backwards and now are looking the front of the blades, the opposite is true. 

Props are designed to spin in one direction though, which is why I brought up ccw spinning props (brittish blades) on my last post. If you could simply mount it backwards and spin it in the other direction then why does aviation and even multi-rotor aircraft have mirrored props for cw or ccw rotation? 

If you spin the prop backwards, yes it prduces airflow, but that airflow is extremely inefficient. It produces as much drag if not more but doesn't blow anywhere near as the same amount of air. 

If you have ever flown rc quads, think about using the same cw blade on all four motors, but mounting the ccw rotating ones backwards so that they blow air in the correct direction. The quadcopter would still be terribly unbalanced and although you might be able to hover (since the torque from drag could be similar) you will never be able to roll or pitch without diving straight into the ground as two of your props are pushing a ton more air than your other two. 

I hope this helps you out understand a little better but again. I doubt this is relevant as I still think it's a centrifugal fan, it would not make sense to mount an axial fan inside a motor without them specifically stating the direction of rotation plus the front side of the motor is sealed so the only way for the airflow to come out is through the sides. Why use an axial fan that pushes flow against a wall when you can use a centrifugal fan that pushes flow out the holes on the can?

I think this picture proves it is a centrifugal fan. ![IMG_3597|375x500](upload://aFJp9YE9Bh6LcuO6OGOd9laGwrW.jpg)
There is a very slight pitch to it which means that there might be a very slight axial flow but most of the flow si definitely radial. 

In contrast, here is what an axial fan looks like. ![image|375x500](upload://zjn5WdprQlxI4bbZFwArFZpBqwK.jpg)

By the way. I think you might have misunderstood how sk3 are built inside.  The fan is not in the same plane as the holes I  the front.  The fan is mounted on the screws you can see in the front part of the can. So air has to be pushed along the motor axis for it to reach the front holes.  And not centrifugally

Correct, the point that I was trying to make is that you could flip a prop and have the motor spin the opposite direction to achieve the same counteracting torque. The torque would cancel out but thrust produced would be very uneven, one would be producing much more thrust than the other. That is why they make cw and ccw props so that when you spin them in opposite directions, they cancel out the torque but also produce the same amount of thrust.

neato. how does this graph work?  is it actually recording while doing 50amps or extrapolating?  Id think ideal might be with it being a bit less efficient at high speed because the motor would be having to force air with the blades.  so the trade off being less efficient at high speed but cooler...and then maybe more efficient as the windings stay cool but at first look the less efficient might be better

What precisely do you want to know?
Manufacturers usually have a dynamometer that they mount their motors to for testing. They are usually openloop (I have not seen anyone else other than myself have a close loop dynamometer). What that means is that they'll mount a certain size prop and run up the motor to full throttle, measuring rpm, torque, current and voltage to create that graph, then they will mount a different prop to create the same graph at different conditions. This way you can map out all the properties of the motor and create a somewhat realistic model for simulation.

With a close loop dynamometer, you have a brake attached to your output shaft instead of a propeller that can command a braking torque. This way, you do not have to interpolate between curves and you can experimentally map out the whole thing in a single run

how would you use ur dyno to see which way the fan works best!?  I think doing the same test run with the same motor but the fan repositioned, then comparing the energy spent would work.   but it would have to be a pretty long run so the heat could have a chance to build or not build and be spun out.


Would you be open to taking some alternative printed designs we could send you?  

I have a design with a theory behind it, and it has two chambers, the outer chamber has the blades like normal but the inner chamber is an empty room with a hole in the center that leads to the outer chamber, that way it would enable longer blades.  made it but never went past that.  could adapt it for the sk3.  don't have a pic on hand

Constant power (at the motor [a set rpm and torque]) runs for 10 minutes with a temperature probe in the stator. If the temperature rises above X then the test ends. Big blower fan to cool the motor between runs. Would be coded and automated. Measurements taken would be voltage and current draw for efficiency calculations.

If there is a fan, it will be centrifugal. It would be an extremely poor design choice to do so otherwise. I'm not sure why you're so dead set in thinking it is an axial fan. As an aerospace engineer, I can tell you that this would be borderline stupid from a manufacturer and designer perspective when you don't specify a rotation direction, and the engineering team behind hobbyking is neither.

its an awful camera but I wont talk badly bout my 300$ computer that does it all.
the blades are very thick here but doubled as mechanical parts so had to be strong.  
a max temp test makes sense.  trying to think of a test where the winner of a least watthours spent would show differently.  running a wattmeter vs installing a thermometer.  Id rather plug in a wattmeter if it would show the same results and have a set route I run, but being able to set-up a  repeatedly doable route would be hard to do in the real world even with the same person accurately.  and maybe these fans do almost nothing to begin with unless going fast.

Yes but honestly, do you think your design is going to be better than something that has been designed and tested by aes with masters and phds in blade design?

You can have crappy fans and decide that one is better than the other but will it even compare to something that has been designed and improved on over several iterations and that you could implement if you simply took the time to do research?

If you really think that your design will knock existing ones out of the water then by all means....

And then the the design i posted above I've never seen.  and the sk3 motor is unique in shape, size, and the speed we'd run it and it adapting research from some other purpose wouldnt be quite the same.

I am also using the SK3, I think that the mesh put at the end of the motor is the cheapest and most durable solution and you don't have to worry about motor getting overheated. It's simple, cheap and works like charm. The first idea of putting a mesh at the end of the motor belongs to @ninja and you can check out his work in this thread. As he said: glue the windings, upgrade your bearings add a mesh and you are good to go.

Anyone get a link where to get replacement bearings for SK3 6374?

What size are they? I don't have one with me unfortunately.

Clockwise appears to be slightly more efficient, based on torque/efficiency curves

However the difference is so small, I don’t think it’s worth stressing over. I prefer to drive the toeside rear wheel. I’ve ridden both ways, and toeside rear drive gives more control in a tuck, since your heel usually isn’t even on the board

**SK3 6374 149KV**

maybe while one direction may show more efficient on a bench spin with no load that need not mean its the best choice in fact id think when on the bench the greater the resistance and therefore lower top speed and less efficient the better as the loss is due to having to push a functioning prop that is moving air out of the motor.   It would be less efficient on bench with no load but when an hour later of pushing real current through the motor the motor would be cooler and have lower electrical resistance because of that and therefore more efficient.
