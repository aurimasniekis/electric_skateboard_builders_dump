Hey guys.  I've been building drones a few years now and I am in the process of building a dual motor electric mountain board.  With that being said I understand the electronics very well.  Considering this is my first 2 builds (one board for me and one for my son) can you guys recommend an economical dual esc for a belt driven board.  I have the board and the motors, sprockets and pulleys ordered but I could use some guidance on a dual esc.  My first build will be a 6s build with a 10s and 12s build later this year.  Keep in mind this is a first build and I am trying to keep this economical since i have 2 boards to build.   Thanks in advance for your help.

Yeah one of my friends bought his board from dickyho via email but their lead time is a little bit much.  I'm hoping I can get the escs within 7-10 days not 4-6 weeks out.  Do you have a direct link from them where I can order directly bypassing ebay and hopefully be able to get expedited shipping?
