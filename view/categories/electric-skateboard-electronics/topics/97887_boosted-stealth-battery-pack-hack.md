Recently bought a "salvage" Boosted Board Stealth (for the deck initially)

After rejoining the balance wires (cut/separated in accident) I'm wondering if it's possible to use the Boosted Battery Pack for a DIY build?![15623031494883391873246970412425|243x500](upload://v3nqCi8ndufYWEEIvjKgF2ClBId.jpeg)

Now I've got everything reconnected I'm wondering why the pack isn't turning on?

As you can see in the photo there's a couple LED's by the debug /program contacts (?). Through the process of reconnecting balance wires they've been on, off or blinking/fading

Any advice would be greatly appreciated ðŸ˜Š

Bms might be bad.  You could tear it all apart and harvest the cells, which is not too easy to do.  If you pass on that pack Iâ€™ll give it a try for $50 for that pack.

Just get rid of the boosted's proprietary bms and get a d140
