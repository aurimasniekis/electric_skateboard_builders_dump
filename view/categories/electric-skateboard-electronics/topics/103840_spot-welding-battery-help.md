Hello I have been trying to get a good spot weld but all off them seem to be weak. I have the keenlab spot welder, It does not want to weld pure nickle strips or even nickle plated steel strips well. The welds are just weak. The only good weld I have been able to get is from strip that came with a Chinese welder and they say they are made out of nickle plated iron. I have not been able to find that same material online, Please if some  one has any information on this tell me. Thank you![IMG_20191111_204546|375x500](upload://qdFHU9bbYzWELTizlGSLHK5cNFY.jpeg)
