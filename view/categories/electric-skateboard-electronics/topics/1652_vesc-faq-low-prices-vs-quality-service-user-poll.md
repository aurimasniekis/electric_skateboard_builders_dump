My first two VESC which didn't last long enough to actually use them were from a different vendor (no need to use his name, we all know who I'm talking about.)  When I emailed him for help, this was his response (five days later) "Please NOTE: If you changed the firmware and now you have an issue it's technically not covered by our warranty."  I'm not paraphrasing, that was a cut and paste from his email.  With this type of customer care one has to wonder how this vendor is still in business.

My next VESCs were from @chaka, now this guy has a passion for our community that is second to none!  I'm not sure what the story is on his new prices but I will tell you that I threw away well over two hundred dollars on my original two VESC.  So if you add the cost of the original VESC plus the two that I had to buy to replace them, $170 a piece seems like a bargain.

If you buy a $99 VESC and you are lucky enough to not have any problems with them, consider yourself lucky!  If you have an issue and need help from that vendor, expect to get an email similar the one I received.  Folks, @chaka is not having his VESC made by someone else, when there is a problem with his stuff he doesn't blame someone else, he simply says "Sorry for your troubles, please put it in an envelope and send it back, I'll take care of it."  I don't know about you but the choice seems simple to me!  Just look on this forum and see how many folks are having trouble with their VESC and how many of them are actually getting help from the vendor.

@chaka for president.   :sunglasses:

BTW, it's not like I didn't spend money with the first vendor.  I spent around $1K USD with this guy.  One last thing before I get off my soap box, I emailed this vendor while I was still waiting for my VESC to please send me an extra c-clip because I had lost one of the clips from the motor shaft, this was his response "Under normal circumstances, I could probably achieve this for you, but I have to send out over 150 units of vesc in one day, normally I don't read the name of the customer - I simply pack the items into a bag then attach a label.
there is a good chance I will forget to do this for you. Sorry for bad service just trying to be honest."

Boy was he honest!

[/quote]


*This is fairly standard stuff guys...*

**Let's apply this logic to something else, Say you buy a new mobile phone, you use a third party hacked app to flash new firmware and you brick the phone.** 

 - Do you expect a 100% refund from the store who sold it to you? 
 - Is it the manufacturers responsibility to replace it just to make you happy?
 - Do you not expect questions to be asked?

**Our warranty is really simple, we cover manufacturing faults!!!.** 
If you can't accept that don't buy from us. 
Basically, you need to prove that the fault is due to manufacturing - If you have modified the VESC or Installed a new firmware & it stops working it becomes very difficult to know if the fault is due to manufacturing. So your option is to submit an RA and return it for review and we will help as much as possible to get it working but if you are responsible for the fault we are not going to bail you out.

This is all fairly simple stuff guys...

Just out of curiosity, how are you frying so many ESC's?
[/quote]

Nearly all failures occur on the bench, or after some playing around with firmware or inputting the wrong settings. Solder shorts or shorted pins is also a cause, this is often classed as a manufacturing fault & is covered under warranty.

Generally speaking, If the vesc is working it generally will continue to keep working.

Wow, have you ever heard the proverb "can't see the forest for the trees?"

My point which you clearly missed in this post, is that failures will happen, it's what happens after the failure that defines the type of vendor that you are!

A 3% failure rate in a vacuum sounds amazing but when that rate is viewed in the shadow of "bad service" (your words!) it doesn't seem so amazing anymore.

It's really simple, people will be loyal to those vendors that want to help their customers.

To those who understand that these sensitive electronics that we are putting in a very hostile environment are susceptible to damage but are still willing to use them, you should consider buying them from @chaka.  It's been my experience that he is willing to help when it counts!

"So everyone needs to have a bit of respect and lay off the negative vibes otherwise this will get really ugly.

So please everyone chill the fuck out."   Wow, so this is respectful?

I bought my first VESC last year having read about them on various forums and watching a couple of Vedders videos. It seemed clear at this time that the product was not ready to be run out commercially and users were thought of as BETA testers - the low price at the time (given batch quantities) reflected buyers risk.

The first VESC died, I’m pretty sure it was faulty and death was not caused by running on unleaded. 

There would be significant cost (in proportion to purchase price) sending back 10,000 miles for autopsy without guarantee of replacement so decided against doing so as in my head I’d accepted the risk of problems, having researched the product first and been warned.

My thoughts on VESC sales

I was initially happy to accept risk of faults and drop-down death as believed price reflected risk and that feedback from BETA testers would lead to development and a more robust and reliable product.

Now that these things seem to be being pumped out the market seems to have adapted a “good product but handle with care” attitude – I’m not sure buyers understand the risk.

@chaka appears to have responded to the first BETA testing developing the VESC (under his control) and offering a fault diagnose/repair service – cost of VESC is similar to my original purchase price (Enertion).

If BETA test stage is over then as a buyer I prefer to cry only once - put the price up - go for development, quality and service.

Ideas for sellers:-

1 month, no quibble, replacement or repair option - certainly be worth paying extra for.

Supply with latest firmware and disable ability for general public to update with BLDC tool – or password protect. Installing the wrong firmware seems to be a common route to blown chips.

If offering cheap mass produced VESC - clearly explain risk to buyers – something like – No money back no guarantees.

this is a really sensible well thought out consumer response.....

I 100% agree with your way of thinking here. This product will eventually mature into a polished retail friendly plug and play fool proof option. it just takes time....

I think after my current $99ea sale has finished I will increase the price and offer a no questions asked 60 day replacement guarantee. This offer will not require the faulty unit to be returned for review, it will simply require some basic photo/video evidence/description of what happened clearly showing the unit is faulty. All faulty units will be replaced with a new unit. End user has to pay for shipping.

**The question is, do people want to pay more up front for this level of product warranty?**

For anyone who doesn't know about the VESC, it is a motor controller that helps esk8 builders make really good, feature rich electric skateboards that in most cases have better performance than most electric skateboards offered by mainstream brands.

***Some of the key features that make the VESC awesome are:***
*1. Open Source*
*2. Regen Braking*
*3. Battery & Motor Voltage/Current control/limits*
*4. Temperature Sensors and cutoff* 
*5. RPM limiting*
*The list goes on & on*

One of the the problems with the VESC is that it is very young, it's basically a newborn who is starting to enter into the nearly-finished-product stage. It is available for purchase from only 3 or 4 sources worldwide, fortunately, most of these sources supply it in a mostly ready-to-use state without too much stuffing around or technical knowledge being required to get it going.

**So be warned!** it's not something that comes in a pretty box with an instruction manual! To use it properly there is some basic knowledge one must possess which can be easily obtained with a few hours of reading. 
**[>Look Here<][1]**  

**SO IS THERE A PROBLEM?**
Some people will try to tell you that the VESC is just not reliable, some people will try to tell you that the Quality of manufacturing is to blame, some people will openly admit that they have stuffed up and destroyed the VESC after making a silly mistake and some people just end up not knowing how to get it to work at all and start pointing fingers.

All of this stuff is probably true to a certain extent, but at the end of the day there are plenty of people who will tell you how awesome the VESC is and will gladly recommend it to anyone. **YES, There are actually many people who have never had a single problem with the VESC and are very happy with their purchase.** The problem is you don't tend to hear the positive stories on these forums because only the negative stuff bubbles to the surface.... and that's how products can get a bad reputation when they don't deserve it.


----------


> Most reasonable people would agree, A product is only as good as the support, warranty & service that backs it up. Right?
> ------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Take Apple products for example:** They have a great reputation right? Is this because they never have problems, apple hardware never fails? NO, its because apple have great service & support... 

Apple build a percentage into their cost base to cover the cost of providing fantastic service & sleek modern stores.... **Some people call this Apple TAX** - You do know that nothing is free! Right? 





> **WHAT IS A WARRANTY?** To understand this you need to understand the insurance business, because that is what a warranty is! It's insurance. Businesses calculate that a small percentage of their products will fail, They calculate failure rates and multiply it by the cost to repair faulty products, add it all together and decide what warranty terms can be offered to all people who buy said product. That's why warranties have strict rules, it's to filter out the claims that are outside of the calculated risk profile & it ensures the books are well balanced by only solving the problems that were costed to solve. Because if business has to cover more warranty claims than it's anticipates it eventually goes broke and then no one gets any warranty because the business doesn't exist. This might explain why some VESC pricing has gone up lately, certain vendors have realised that they actually need to make some profits to continue to offer great service, this should not be frowned upon by consumers it's just common business sense.

----------


**So let's discuss (&vote) about this matter regarding the VESC!**

What would you prefer?

[poll]
 - **VESC <$99USD** - Very Limited 10 days Warranty & Very Limited Email Support
 - **VESC $130USD** - Longer More Flexible - Back-to-Base - 6 months Warranty & Basic Email Support  
 - **VESC $170+ USD** - Long Warranty 1yr+ Unlimited Email/Phone Support, No questions asked replacement for any failure.

heres my reasoning to pick the cheapest option.  I know these VESC's are well made, and most of the issues that come out of them are from installing them incorrectly which means that usually they break within the first 10 days while theyre being installed. 

my guess

@onloop I agree with @barajabali ... I'm involved in DIY because I'm willing to tinker with something and possibly repair it if needed. I would rather have access to a bare-bones device that I can afford, vs a fully-warranteed device that I can't buy. A 70% price increase isn't one that I'd endorse in this case.

I'll happily pay for higher quality, but I don't want to cost-share the price of repairs for everyone else who haphazardly abused the device and fried it. As other have said, the majority of problems with VESC right now are due to incorrect firmware updating and shorts or bad soldering\installation by a customer. Part of the fun of DIY is learning how to properly do things. If I break something by accident, and it's my fault or ignorance that leads to the damage, I'd rather pay for a repair when it happens.

But if you asked about this outside of the DIY community, the response would be quite different. I think that to make VESC a mass-market device you'll need to make it less possible for users to ruin it, by locking down features and putting it in a good-looking encasement.

I think the quality seems fair. However, having bought 2 VESC myself, 1 worked great out the bag and the other, is supplying 3.2 volts to the receiver instead of 5 volts. To me, it seems like a manufacturing fault, but again, could it be the firmware update I had to do in order to even test it? I couldn't find any mac version other than 2.15, so in order to test the VESC, I had to do a firmware update (And I think many are in this boat). I did the same steps on both of my vescs, and one works great, and the other has the problem mentioned above, and both are v4.10, but 2 different batches. The one I'm having trouble with is the last batch you sold @onloop at the end of 2015. I haven't tested to see if it can still be used a slave or not.

What I can say, is I would pay an extra $10 just to know it was hand tested with a controller and motor to verify it works before shipping them. Seeing as shipping and waiting times for the VESC is usually long, having one arrive with problems is frustrating.

Why not offer warranties as optional addons, like apple care for the VESC?

I think some will not be able to afford $170, and will go to rc escs.

Others may love the idea of an apple care style warranty, and be willing to pay another $70 or $80 for the warranty.

Well if the failure rate is only 3% why would we have to pay 30% or 70% more to get ourselves a warranty?

I want to give you an idea of where I come from
In the place I work at, we have a failure rate of 7% (within 2 years) on white goods in my department.

We offer a 5 years no questions asked kind of warranty that costs 20-25% the products' price. So you could in theory smash your washing machine with a baseball bat after 4,5 years and get it replaced with a similar (probably newer) model without having to open your wallet.

Those rates seem a lot more reasonable to me.

Because if you factor in the mistakes people make that break it, the rate of needing replacement would be much higher. A lot of people kill their VESC, because it's very easy to do that.

Apple care style warranties would mean if you fry your VESC, it gets replaced.

The whole point of this is that some aren't buying the VESC in fear they will break it ( becuase the VESC has an image that its fragile, which I think it is). It is not cheap, at $99 or $170. You can get FVTs which work pretty good for a fraction of the price and less chance they will fry it.

@mohammedex with your business, it is hard to compare to the VESC. As it is, @onloop hardly marks the VESC price up past manufacturing costs. I bet that a $400 washing machine cost more like $100 to make (thus being sold at 400% markup). While a VESC, I'm guessing would cost similar to $70 each to make, and sold for a 15% or 20% markup at best. Compared to 400% markup, you can see why offering a warranty on the washing machine at 20% to 25% is possible, while doing so on the VESC is not.

My understanding is that the idea behind $170 is your factoring in the cost of 2 VESCs per person, so if they fry one or there is a manufacturing defect, the suppliers bottom line is (hopefully) not hurt.

Then it would seem that 3% failure rate is indeed a statistic in a vacuum and not how many customers are actually having issues with the products or there would be no solid reasoning behind not offering a better warranty..

My questions are, what is the reasoning behind the three options being given? What is justifying the price increases? The warranty alone? Are there upgrades being made to make it more user friendly/safe for tinkering/better protected or is there an acceptance that fragility is just an innate issue with VESC's? 

I lean towards the middle option, but the language being used is very careful and leads me to be wary of the warranty options being discussed here. If I am just paying extra for the warranty that's "no questions asked" except send me proof and then we can debate who's fault it is etc...then I'd rather roll the dice on a cheap unit and just be careful with it.

Edit: And basing the amount of email support/customer service on a price difference seems absolutely senseless.. Whether I spent a dime yet with you or not I expect any decent business should promptly reply to all customer concerns and questions.. Am I crazy?

Actually the extra warranty in my business doesn't come from the manufacturers themselves. Its from an external firm, meaning that the external firm has to cover and covers the price of the machine, so following your example the customer would get a 400$ refund if the washing machine breaks. I would post a link that states the rules and stuff, but its all in danish :sweat_smile: Thats not what this is about though.

Onloop clearly states that the "warranty is really simple, we cover manufacturing faults!!!. 
If you can't accept that don't buy from us. "

Meaning that we don't have to "factor in the mistakes people make that break it" because those mistakes are not covered!

So I would think that about a 10$ increase should cover about the cost of the VESC's with a manufacturing defect (10$ accounting for labor costs), and I think its only fair and natural to ask more than just exactly enough to cover the expenses. 15-20$ would be perfectly reasonable. but having to pay 30/70% more for a warranty seems a bit too much, but then again, customers dont usually decide the price they want to pay for a product, but since we do this time I clearly vouch for the cheaper option. Not to mention that shipping back to Australia from across the globe costs as much as a few eboards in itself, meaning that I would probably never use my warranty anyway.

Okay...Here's my take on the matter. I like cheap prices...However, cheap quality drives me up the wall!! I'd rather pay more for quality than less for imminent landfill. I feel the cost of the VESC should include the amortization of associated expenses including limited customer service $$. I love great deals, but I am also a realist and don't have the same expectations from a smaller company than I  would for a corporate juggernaut. They can absorb a lot more loss and due to the greater infrastructure and allocate massive payroll expenditures towards a more efficient consolidated customer service model. Realistically, there is no way you can keep up with selling VESC if they aren't good because you don't have the manpower yet to handle the load. VESCs are going to have issues, many of which are caused by user error. People need to get a balanced approach to what they expect from a vendor. I feel as well that these VESC, being manufactured in the US under stringest quality standards, should rarely fail from mfg defect. I have worked as a Receiving Inspector and Cost Estimator for an ISO mfg for years, so I've seen some shit. With some contract pricing arrangements and such, the cost will continue to come down. Especially after the initial setup and tooling is paid for and approved. I also think that keeping the VESC under a bill will be the pivotal draw that will get the proverbial juices flowing, increasing demand, and thereby driving higher volume mfg runs for better piece pricing. IMHO...$99US bucks is going to be the draw!! Looks a lot better in ads and creates that fish "biting the worm" response. LOL That shit completely worked on me!! 
So in short...Keep the price in the "impulse buy range"... under $100US, Get contract pricing on components to reduce mfg cost, and insulate yourself from losses as much as humanly possibly.
 Sorry consumers...It sounds bad, but that's business. That is how you are able to continue to provide these products, which is a service in and of itself. Volume is going to be the key to scaling up to meet consumer demand. It is the water in the pump, the gas in the engine, the meat in your taco..LOL There is a learning curve to building an ESK8. A vendor can't be expected to hold someones hand and eat losses due to customer incompetence. Think about if you were to go to your local auto parts store and  you bought a bunch of fuel injectors for your rig. (Without any prior experience in the field)You install them improperly and they fail catastrophically...Do you go back to the auto parts store and look for some sort of recompense? Hell No!! Because they are a PARTS store!! If you do, you suck and stuff costs more because of Aholes like you... Anywhoo...If you sell a fully complete board it gets a little more into the gray area. Because in theory, you are selling a finished and ready to use ride. I'm a total noob to this forum so don't beat me up too bad!! Peace!! :skull:

Sort of my same logic. Asking customers if they want to pay less for a product, but get shitty customer service in return for the low price is bonkers. Charge whatever you have to in order to


1. Provide excellent customer service **always**.
2. Put out a high quality product that limits risk as much as possible for everyone.
3. Protect yourself from losses due to manufacturing errors, and customer complaints/returns ( regardless of if it's just because they're idiots or not)

I understand this is difficult with this specific item being that it is higher tech, in a growing, niche market of newbie DIY'ers like myself, but this is just good business 101. If you can't do it all and still make money, sell something else. The community as a whole is done no good by comprising on any of these points. Or you can just be a good samaritan giving away your work for free if that's your thing.. :stuck_out_tongue:

I would try to get to that theme from another point of view. In order to keep the prices low and to do profit I think you need a huge amount of customers. And to attract a lot of customers there must be one fool proof version of the VESC which is just plug and play and has a guarantee over a year. 
Otherwise I think a lot of customers are too scared to buy an VESC. 
I would realize that with a fool proof version of the bldc tool. In addition I would directly add a download link of the BLDC tool that matches the board which the customer receives in the order confirmation Email, and a link to a video where it is explained how to set it up.
In addition I would advertise with the easy arduino connection to VESC. A ton of people use arduino and so you would also get customers that are motivated DIY people and can't program a micro controller themselfes. But I think that is what the VESC should be for. To give a lot of people a tool to realize their DIY projects... 

To keep the same possibilities which the VESC has now I would keep the BLDC tool like it is at the moment and call it something like professional layout. If the customer makes a firmware update I would give a message to the customer that the no question return warranty isn't valid any longer and directly implement a funktion in the BLDC tool that transmits the hardware production number of the VESC to your company. If anybody wants to play around with the firmware or other dangerous settings the garantee is just valid after the customer proofed that it is a production failure... 

I think that could be a way to keep prices down, attract a lot new customers and rise profits ...
