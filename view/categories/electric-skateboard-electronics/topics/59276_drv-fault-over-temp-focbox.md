Yeah it should be R1, but maybe try reflashing to Enertion firmware as they will not support a flashed Focbox....oops too late

HW should be 412 not 48, that is the wrong firmware..... That why I hate these new vesc tool that too easy to screw up.

You flashed the wrong firmware it should have done the 410 411 412 file.  You possibly fried it so I would send it in to @JohnnyMeduse to get fixed

I thought that when I did the first update I saw the current hw was 48. So chose 48. Guess I need to get a sl link to change it to 412, bootloader is also broken....
Thanks for the help!

```
the most of the vesc we use for eboards are 4.12 hardware so you just need to do the correct firmware.

That's what I did, and why it broke I think ...

## \#17 Posted by: Joris97 Posted at: 2018-06-18T16:06:05.120Z Reads: 69

Because it still says 48 when I upload 412

so just to re-iterate

- uploaded bootloader in bootloader tab
![image|690x415](upload://yfSQXpdOcw9YYmkkU92kNv87saj.png)

-Downloaded the [ 4_12 firmware from vedder's github](https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_tool/tree/master/res/firmwares/410_o_411_o_412)

-Navigate and select "VESC_default.bin" in the 410_411_412 folder and upload it

```
not with @ackmaniac he only defaults for hardware 410 411 412 . to access the rest, you have to click a button that says "show non-default firmwares". I guess same with the regular vesc tools?

@Joris97

I would love to assist you with this problem via team viewer
you don't need ST-Link to flash it, just get the right firmware file and re-upload it.

I am available now, DM me if you need an assistance now :slight_smile:

If u can solve it , then we can do that :slight_smile:
But I'm pretty sure I already tried to upload the right software this time, but it doesn't change..
