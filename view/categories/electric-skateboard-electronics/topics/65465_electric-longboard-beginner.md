Hey guys, a few days ago I came out with an idea to build electric longboard. I was looking for building tutorials and after almost 11 hours I've chosen those parts. Is it going to work? Is there any possibility to check how many km (or miles) could I ride on this board? I already have longboard (Madrid cutout 2). My budget is something around 250$. I am going to use this board for casual riding, nothing extreme. It doesn't have to be splash resistant but it would be good if i could cheaply make board splash resistant . As long as anti sparks aren't to expensive, I may buy one.

You could plug in the values of your parts in here: http://calc.esk8.today/ that should give you the top speed and max range. I suggest using the search function to look up diagrams of how you will wire everything up but you have the fundamental components down I believe.

Also try putting up a build log so others can understand what you're trying to achieve with your build and they can more easily suggest things to get what you're looking for out of it.

Make a post about your build, kind of what you did here but in greater detail. Explain what kind of board do you want to build. Where do you plan on riding, is it going to be for a commute or for fun casual use.

lay down the parts of the build. I noticed you didn't list any deck as well. Also indicate your budget range and features you would like to have such as an anti-spark switch or a voltage meter of having it splash/water resistant. Things like that

A build log is a section on this forum with other users boards they made. Most identify parts and stuff to help others decide if that's the type of board they want to build.

Pretty good build together. Problem is those diyeboard trucks are becoming known for snapping and causing injury at speed. And they make you pay postage for a replacement to sweeten it

any replacement for let's say 150$? I'd prefer not to buy motor separately. I already have trucks and wheels but I don't think wheels would support motor

Those trucks are going to be hard to mount a motor on. Since the are circular on the hangar, the mounts won't have much purchase and will just spin around once any bit of torque is applied.

For $250 you are going to have a tough time building your own board IMO.

Good luck!

Hi man,
Welcome to the DIY world. I see your point of stay low in budget for your first board. We all have done this step and then with the time you will decide what to upgrade. Although I think 250$ if you need almost everything is not gonna work out, you need to raise it a bit. Otherwise you might be able to do something that will satisfy you for max two months and you will end it up by spending more because you have to adapt things or replace it. To me you have two options. Going full DIY and then do it your proper research and like the others said, make a build log and post your parts list. You will receive advice from this community. You won't be let alone, the people around here are great! Or if you want still be able to use your deck but do something nice and fast by one of the kit from ownboard, Meepo, DIYEboard... They are all really similar, except DIYEboard offers also belt drive. Be aware that indeed more truck issues are happening now more than ever, probably trying to make it more profit. Anyhow I would suggest to save some money until you have a 400$ budget. Just my two cents :wink:

It's not that easy. Depends what are you looking for. Commute board or sporadic ride for fun. What range are you looking for? Power? Weight?
You don't need to know the parts but what you want. We will then advice you about it :wink:

More like for fun, It'd great if it would have more than 12km of range (7.5 miles). Power? I don't know, but I'd like to ride on it at least 26 km/h. I'm 188cm and I weight 70kg. Weight of the board is not such a big deal for me

ok fortunatelly these are not impossible specs so it's feasible. Do you like more belt drive (like Evolve or Boosted Board) or direct drive (Raptor2, Meepo ecc...)? THe first one have the motor outside and other inside the wheels. You can find a lot of builds on the forum for inspiration.
```

You can change sleeves on hub motors. Since you already have a board it would be much cheaper to buy one hub motor and use a diyeboard ESC with it. To go 26km/hr you might need more series groups eg 8s or 9s

Then the kit options are limited to almost DIY eboard only. Anyhow I would then recommend to build a single belt drive motor in order to stay cheaper but still good quality. I will put a bit of prices below of thing that you can find in different options, so you will which budget to aspect. Moreover find the parts on the used items on the forum will get you better parts for cheaper price, so starts to look at it!
Deck: The one you have or a blank deck or good offer for 60 Euro
Trucks: Caliber trucks 60Euro o clones for 30$
Wheels: Clones for 40Euro or original from 130 Euro to a lot!
Motor: I would say at least 6355 to have fun. You can find good one for 55-90Euro, TorqueBoards, Maytech, HobbyKing, Flipsky ecc...
Pulley kit: cheap 16/36 or similar around 10Euro from ebay...
VESC: I think the cheapest good quality is the Flipsky 50A for around 60Euro
Motor Mount: Can be really expensive but this guy sell them for an amazing price, didn't follow the reviews though https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-designed-a-motor-mount-for-sale-looking-for-review/59212
Belts: From Ali or similar market really cheap 5-10Euro
Battery: Here for your range almost everything above 5000 will do the job. I suggest LiIon if you are not use to charge LiPo battery. You can build your own battery, buy a premade one or let someone make it for you. Ownboard sells a 10s2p 30Q Samsung battery (The cells most used in Esk8 at the moment). This guy is selling a 10s2p 30Q pach at a price I have never seen before, so I would actually think about it https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-new-turnigy-sk8-6354-200-kv-used-racerstar-5065-200-kv-turnigy-sk3-260-kv-8s-charger-pulleys-10s2p-samsung-30q/65452/4 90Euro is nothing. Only the cells are around 80 Euro!
Of course also a 8s battery will work, but the lower you go the less power. The same for the p value. The lower the less range. I would stay on a 8s3p or 10s2p at leas for Liion.
Remote: Strong signal remote for 30-40 Euro
Cables and connectors: 20-40 Euro.

TIME :laughing:
Do the math...
I hope I didn't forget anything

I recommend you to buy a used board or used parts to make your own build. Shippings will waste your budget so do not buy from many different sellers.

i didn't even know kit.com existed. Seems like it might be useful for things like this. 

Also, i'm happy that its even possible at all now to build an esk8 for $400 even if the deck or other stuff is preowned. It used to be pretty much impossible unless you had access to machines or a real shop of some kind. 

Use a silicone sealant to seal your board. It will be fine. And try to use heat shrink on your connections if possible, it will minimize water/shorting damage.

Al the part you have in kit.com are sold on HK. IF you use HK don't forget to add HOBBYKING10 for 10% discount during the check out.
Pulley kit you can find on Ali https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-pulley-kit-skateboard.html?spm=2114.search0104.0.0.643c2ecdfNvUQC&site=glo&groupsort=1&SortType=total_tranpro_desc&g=y&SearchText=pulley+kit+skateboard. Depends which wheels are you gonna use it.

Sorry for not replying,  but as a new member i have limited possibilities. To the point. I can't find other products from aliexpress on hk, could you link me them? And also, I don't know how to find pulley kit that will fit properly (i know, you've linked me it, but I don't know which one choose. My wheels are 70mm 80a, photo of them is at the bottom. If they won't fit could you link me good wheels to max 35$? And you said that Filipsky 50a would be good. Could you check if I've chosen good vesc? Here's the link to upgraded kit (Idk how, but i forgot remote :sweat_smile: )

Wait maybe there is a bit of confusion. Aliexpress is one site. HK means HobbyKing which is another one.
Concerning your wheels to small for belt drive your motor mount, wheel pulley ecc is not gonna fit.
I would say at least 83mm. >90mm for smoother ride. If you use 63xxmm motors than at least 90mm wheels.

Always wear a helmet. I didn't see that mentioned here, but skating on an electric you just built is far far more dangerous than skating on a non-electric you just built. Not just because its fast, but because it launches you instead of you launching it. You have a far higher chance of ass,back of skull streeting. And face streeting on virgin brakes as well.

Also, avoid using large glass bongs while riding at higher speeds. Even if you can get it lit, its just going to blow out of the bowl anyway, probably into your eye, at which point you'll probably carve violently into the curb, throwing yourself forward and impaling yourself on the bong only to be eaten by racoons and vultures by morning.

You better play with the calculator to understand whihc motor pulley and wheels pulley you want because 97mm will give you more top speed but less torque, so better to balance. Did yo decide the motor? it is also important to decide the pulleys

Now I am at the phone but I will have a look later. If someone else can reply please help him. Anyhow the motor you chose is great. Only think that better you are aware is bigger than others because has a fan in it so good for cooling but if you want to go duak in future is tricky to paired in the classical configuration. Just wanted to let you know. Good choice 6374 btw

Have a look with 10s1p, that motor and 97mm wheels these could be good configuration. The lower the speed the more torque you get. Take into account that usually if a motor is 192Kv it is actually a bit less so you will get a bit more torque and less top speed. So 15 motor Pulley and 36 wheel Pulley seems OK. You could ask on the specific thread for that motor the real Kv they have. It is like new sk8 Hollyking motor....
EDIT: wrong pics, right ones few posts below 
You have to look at the loaded speed.

Sorry I posted the wrong picture so you need 15 36 more speed or 15 38bfor more torque but still reach 40khm

Then you need to find a Pulley kit abec 11 or flywheels. The motor Pulley has to be metal for sure, the wheel Pulley can be also printed in case you don't find it. I would say at least 12mm belt width otherwise the belt will skip a lot during hard braking

I live in Belgium, so same GST no problem :wink:
This one should be perfect https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/15mm-Wide-Belts-DIY-ABEC-Flywheel-Pulley-Kit-265mm-255mm-/222758410971. IS a 15mm kit so you run 12mm or 15mm. The higher the less belt skipping, but more resistance when you cruise.
Is a 15t/36t it will give you a bit more of top speed )see the picture I sent you above, if you will feel that you want more torque, then change the motor pulley or wheel pulley. You can play with the calculator, you set the same parameter I used and just change either the motor pulley or the wheels pulley. Try to do not decrease to much on the motor pulley because otherwise you will have belt skip.
For motor pulley alternative and belts https://powge.nl.aliexpress.com/store/all-wholesale-products/702327.html?spm=a2g0z.12010615.0.0.371c6f35plbqSS
When you know the length of the belt that you need it, order some because you will need to change them.
For the wheel pulley, you can buy it or print it, so you can test multiple one. You find the STL from @JuniorPotato93 on the forum and Thingverse. They are great!
A 40T (maybe to much because it will reduce to much the speed) https://it.aliexpress.com/item/40-Tooth-5M-Pulley-for-E-Board/32760121802.html?spm=a2g0s.8937460.0.0.69ef2e0e5rFHMi

Note: When you choose a motor pulley you need to check the bore size, which has to be the same of the your motor. IN your case both are 8mm so is gonna fit.
For the wheel pulley it's important the wheel core. The one I linked you is correct.

it should work only thing I see that it comes with a 11mm belt width. For a single drive l won't go lower than 12mm or the belt will slip. Ask the seller whether you can use a 12mm or 15mm belt with it.
THen if you need a a different motor pulley, use one of the link I sent you above from Aliexpress. There you can find belts and motor pulley.

I know the other link is only motor Pulley. That's why I posted it. Since the kit give you 11t and 36t you only need to buy a cheap motor Pulley with 15/16t to get a better ration. Find motor Pulley it's easier than wheel Pulley. Anyhow the kit you posted is ok. Again it will give you 11 and 36 so to me order an additional motor Pulley and correct belt is worth it.

I mean that if you change the motor pulley you will also need a different belt length. Bigger motor or wheel pulley will require a slightly longer belt. Although from the seller I linked to you you get good belt for really really cheap compare EU stores. Just remember to chose HTD5M belt to have deeper teeth and since you will take a 15mm pulley kit (which is great) to pick up 15mm belt. Really strong.

No maybe you didn't understand what I meant. What I said is the kit you post is ok. Buy it! I only said that the kit you posted has a 11t motor Pulley and 36t wheel Pulley. So to adjust the ratio my advice was to get another motor Pulley. That's why the link from the AliExpress seller. I do not know how to explain my self better. I didn't mean any shipment to Belgium.

The pulley kit is fine, only thing ask the seller which belt width you can use it. THe one they provide is 11mm and if that is the maximum, to me is too narrow. At least 12mm, better 15mm like the previous kit you found.
The motor  has 3 phase wires (the one with bullet connector) and one jst 6 pins connector for the sensors. Your motor can run sensored but is not mandatory. Yes the phase wires are short, but the wire on the vesc are long and could be enough, otherwise you need to buy new bullet connectors male and females and solder them with 12 awg wire to make extensions. I recommend anyway to change the 4mm bullet connector present on Motors with 5.5 bullet connector, same thing for the vesc. HK has the 5.5 bullet connector https://hobbyking.com/en_us/polymax-5-5mm-gold-connectors-10-pairs-20pc.html.
The sensor wire usually comes with the wrong JST for the VESC, They are usually JST ZH 6 pins but you need JST PH pins. Although this model was made for electric skateboard from HK, so can be that it already has the right JST. Ask in the thread on the forum or to HK directly.

The sensor is to run the motor sersored or not. It give yuo a better start from stop. Really smooth. TO better understand without sensors you will need to kick push your board to start, otherwise the motor will rattle at the beginning. After you move there is no difference.
The kit ok.
NO differnce in red and black wires. we usually use red for positive and black for negative, but the only different is the silicon color. For phase wire better to use the black one for a perfect match.

You can also buy it from the Flipsky website if you buy the motor and the VESC then you have free shipping. Plus there is a 20% coupon code. If you need it I would have a look

ok, i've already bought things from ebay (motor mount, pulley kit) and aliexpress (kapton tape, vesc, wheels with bearings, remote, series connector and battery indicator) now only thing left to do is hk (5.5 bullet connector, xt60 connectors, two batteries, heat shrink and awg12 wire) and banggood (motor) all is good?

you also need xt90 antispark if you want to make the antispark loopkey. The rest looks fine.

you can use whatever connector you want to the vesc, but you have xt60 so why do not use them. The 5.5 bullet connectors are for the vesc to motor.
I really advice you to make a detail drawing of all your set up and post it. So we can check it. Otherwise I ma afraid you are going to connect something wrong.
Make a schematic diagram showing batteries, vesc, loppkey, motor with all the connectors and mark the different polarities with plus (red) and negative (black). So we can check.

Perfect. What are you going to use as enclosure and to mount it to the board?
I will also suggest to buy some storng velcro to fix electronics and battery to the deck, so the weight doesn't affect your enclosure integrity

Good as velcro I use this one https://hobbyking.com/en_us/polyester-velcro-peel-n-stick-black-1-meter.html really crazy strong. Then you will need some screws adn bolt but you can also find them locally in a hardware shop.

Remember to make connections as short as possible, shouldn't be a problem since you put everything in a lunch box, but still try to keep the wires between battery to vesc and from vesc to motor as short as possible.

the secret is measure twice and cut once :wink:

Wow now that whats I call being helpful. What an amazing forum and people. 

I recently completed my first board for about £300 and loving every moment.(5065 270kv motor, 6S Battery, 90mm wheels, HK Vesc) main issues I had were with the motor mount. I have round trucks and mount would keep moving. I ended up drilling into the hanger a little and screwing the bolts into it. Good luck with the build.

the first one is a balance charger so if you are not planning to put a bms you will need it for sure. The second one is a standard charger adn you need a 10s one, so 36V. You can use it if you install a BMS on your battery
