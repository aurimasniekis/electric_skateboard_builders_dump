These cells are rated at 10a each but mooch says that there is some sag on 10A and he recommends it on 7a per cell which is still 63a  cont and probably 120a burst when needed/if needed. (im around 115kg with the deck)

Im building a trampa for the streets/ light cursing no mtb as im too lazy and that seems exhausting

This should give me a nice 1100wh so no worries about how much juice i got left
Do you guys have any reason not to make a battery with these cells?
They are on ES for 3.6$ each so this is 360$, a steal!

If I were going to get a load of cheaper, lower-discharge cells than the 30Q but still with a decent capacity, would be wrong to overlook the humble PF

https://eu.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/panasonic-ncr18650pf-3-7v-2900mah.html

Are they that significantly different in terms of sag? 
Capacity diff is 450mAh that's tempting

BTW the GA is outta stock on nkon, maybe look at splitting 180+ the discount makes a load of sense

Im planning on buying the cells from EndlessSphere 3.6$ each
These PF cost 3.15$ each i think these 45cents per each are worth the extra $
29ah for 361 (sanyo)
26 For 311$

And I also readed somewhere that those PF have high IR and sag a lot

Im not sure, lets say they are 8a cont (rated 10)
Thats still 73a cont which should be enaugh

they are less then 35 mohm so at 8 in parallel its like  5 mohm which is lovely les than a 4p12s q30 pack witch is like 6,5 


i also ordert a few 26650 liitokala cells of china they say they are 20a discharge 5000mah and 26 mohm for 4 euro a piece !!! so it seems to good to be true so i ordert 4 and some 1 ohm resistors so i am gone put them true some heavy cycels and she if they can be a candidate

I have these cells in a 10s4p config. Great for cruising and have no prob reaching speed and climbing hills. Has a pretty decent tourque but some expected sag being lighter in the discharge dept. But 9p you would love these cells.

 Yes mono drive 6374 190kv. 16/36 gearing. In BLDC mode got it up to 42km/hr and about 39km/hr in FOC. If you have hills to climb, get batteries with a higher discharge (unless you go with lots of parallel groups) but on flats I'm very happy with these cells. Good safe chemistry as well apparently.

I've just built a 10S9P pack with NCR18650GA cells for my Trampa with dual 6374s which has been built to climb big off road dirt tracks. I've only given the board a few quick test runs at this point but its handling things really well so far.

Going 9P with these cells when you're not even really planning on going off road should be a non issue. 

Not sure what chemistry Samsung's 30Q uses exactly but I believe these Sanyo cells are essentially the same chemistry that Tesla use (LiNiCoAlO2) so I'm expecting to get a decent amount of cycles out of them.

Looking to do some more serious off road hill climb testing this weekend so will be interesting to see how things go.

I also have them in 10S3P, climb lots of hills with ease, dual 5055, I can climb 17% at 30km/h
The limit speed for climbing higher inclines is 17km/h due the duty cycle ratio between battery and motor current, in that condition I tried a max of 22% so far

They should be great in big P config, thereâ€™s a point that there is not reason to have more discharge since you prabably never use it

Also worth mentioning that Mooch's tests are done with these cells pushing 10A for the entire time till they're completely discharged, something that never happens for our use case. 

At 9P, chances of using anywhere close to 90A for more than a few seconds at a time seem pretty minimal unless you're doing some crazy hill climbing :)

I've been told if you take proper care of these cells you can get up to 2000 charges without any crazy degradation. We'll see.

Here's hoping. I've got my charger cutoff set to 41V and I tend not to discharge below 30% or so that should help a lot

I've read like every 10th time its actually good to fully charge and discharge (not below 31V). 
@moon I've only got about 2.5 months on that pack. So time will tell.

Any updates on the cells performance in 10s3p config

Perfectly fine, Iâ€™m nearly 300km on them, same performance as the first time I tested, managing do ride 36 km with a 33 km/h or 44 km if I limit the board to 25 km/h

But... the more I ride the more I want more in certain situations, like hills that I have to keep up with traffic, other than that itâ€™s perfect for me, Iâ€™d rather loose a bit of climbing and be able to run 44+ km than climb one or two hills more quickly and have less range

Yep, this is my run with the 25 Km/h speed limit, was adjusting to the new deck when I did and the confidence was low, if I have time i will do this same route again with the higher limit, the 36 Km is based on the consumption I'm getting, 10,3 Wh/Km

Are there any hills in your area/are you throttle heavy or a constant speed carvey kinda ridey. Cause i get like 20 18 miles hard riding on my 10s4p :smiley:

Riding style changes the range a bit for me, but not too much, if Iâ€™m just riding near my house I ride more aggressively, but at long rides is almost constant speed and a hill and another, thereâ€™s not too places I can ride here, smallish city and I guess half of the streets are bad pavement to ride

I made a new mode limiting the currents and speed a lot, letâ€™s see if I can crack 50 Km

I think my 5055 motors are a big factor on that, I use the same amount of energy I used with a single 6355
