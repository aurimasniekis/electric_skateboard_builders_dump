Hey guys, I bought the ACTON link board in the past and I absolutely hate it. Since I put a sum in that I would like to know what is the best price to speed board that goes over 20mph and is less than 300 all together. Thx

There is no high-quality complete electric skateboard for $300 USD total. At that price point you'll get something that is fun for a while but won't last. There's just no way to make a great board that cheaply. Not yet, anyway.

Idk if he is looking for reliablility but the wowgo and meepo boards might be less than 300 depending on where he lives.

you get what you pay for, but for around 300-400, I'd go with a meepo.

The cheapest and not totally horrible board you could get:
Ebay ESC and remote: $50
Motor: $50 used from someone
Motor Mount: $50
Trucks: $30
Wheels: $30
Gearing: $20
Batteries: $35
Deck and enclosure: $35

That's $300. For that you'll get a board that accelerates and breaks unpredictably curtesy of the cheap ESC. It will also ride like crap due to the cheap chinese wheels and cheap deck. You will ride it for 30 days, then decide you want to upgrade it in order to ride smoother. Save yourself the money and do it right the first time.
