I'm assuming you're in the USA

crappy, better, and best

The [cheapest one is 1A](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Max-42V-1A-Power-Battery-Charger-For-Pocket-Mod-Sports-Mod-Dirt-Quad-Lithium/401399007414?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2055119.m1438.l2649), there are [also 2A](http://www.diyeboard.com/10s-42v-2a-lithium-battery-charger-for-10s-electric-skateboard-p-512.html) and [4A versions](https://metro-board.com/shop/fast-charger-for-slim-lithium-battery-4-amp/).  You need to ensure your battery can charge at that rate.  You might need to solder the correct connector on it.  The 2A one is probably the best bet.
