My focbox USB does not work. No it's not the cord, since my other focbox works with the cord and drivers are installed correctly. I'm pretty sure it's something with the PCB but I'm not sure what. Does anyone have any ideas what might cause a USB to not function? I don't have another 1.7 focbox to compare the PCB with. If anyone could chime in that would be much appreciated. It's a brand new focbox that's been in storage.

Focbox 1.7 and VESC-X side by side. have you checked continuity with the USB port?
