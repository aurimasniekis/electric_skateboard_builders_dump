I'll get right to it ..

Nickle strips : what dimensions are required for a 10S3P Samsung 25R pack ?

Can someone give me some info regarding cell level fusing ?

This should be OK for shipment to Belgium. .15 will spot weld easily, but be tough enough for solid connection. You can go wider with the strip, but 8mm is a nice size to work with and will conduct just fine. 10M might be more than you need, but you never know. It's good stuff to have since you can't just buy it anywhere.

That's a nickle plated strip if i'm not mistaking...

I contacted the seller of the other nickle strip, he'd make an exception for me :smile: .

Thanks for the info about the cell-level fusing, i'll read-up on it. Might have some questions though ;)

If you have trouble getting pure nickel strip let me know <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/f/df0cda542cde6fe68f3dbd6a9952e394562b59f3.jpg" width="666" height="500">

@scepterr where do you live? (I might need some more pure nickel strips... :grin:)

@ikjahaa 8mm x 0.15mm is good is good for spot welding and can carry 5A cont. without any problems, adding more layers and/or designing serial connections correctly will make 2 layers of those nickel strips on your 10S3P able to handle 30A cont easy. (It will be able to handle more for for short durations.)

Based on what formula did you calculate this ?
I ended up purchasing 12mm x 0.15mm strips

I bought 10 x .15mm strips but maybe I should've picked 12mm instead. I'm sure they'll work fine. As for fusing wire I recommend using 18-20awg tin coated copper. I have 22 awg and they've been breaking on me, so I've been doubling up on the wires.

I assume you are referring to my calculations.
I am basing the information on what I read in this book https://www.amazon.com/DIY-Lithium-Batteries-Build-Battery-ebook/dp/B06XRKD15B.
His name is Micah Toll and he runs the youtube channel ebikeschool. He has many educational videos and I found it really useful for understanding everything from serial/parallell connections to BMS.

I bought 12mm but 10mm would've been sufficient for my needs.

Question,
I got 12mm x 0.15mm 12x0.15 40A Nickle strips,
My cells are sumsung 25R wicht are rated at 20A ea. My battery is 10S3P, does this mean i need to double up the parrallel connections ? 20A *3P = 60A right ?

No, only the bridges to the other parallel cells need doubling up and even then it's a little overkill.
