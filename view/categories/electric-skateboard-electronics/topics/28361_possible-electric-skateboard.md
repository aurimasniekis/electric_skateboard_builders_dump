So i have created a list of parts that i think im going to use to build my electric sk8board. I have some concerns about the fact that i have 2 10s huge batteries. Can someone a bit more qualified check this out and say if it work.

Only way to make two 10s batteries work is to wire them in parallel.

What is your goal for this board?  To go fast, get up hills, go far?

The battery in the link is a 4s battery. If you were to connect the two in series that would give you 8s

go far is the goal and for me 25km/h is plenty enough

The 10C discharge is wayy low for an electric skateboard, I would recommend 20-30C constant discharge instead.

I was replying to OP, not your build.  Speaking of these batteries: Multistar High Capacity 16000mAh 4S 10C Multi-Rotor Lipo Pack
