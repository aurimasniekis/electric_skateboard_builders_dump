I'm looking for a thin lipo with high discharge for a 10S build. I've always been getting Zippy/Turnigy cells off hobby king but I was wondering if anyone knew of a higher quality source.

max amps give you a guarantee... hard to beat

that said unless you have gone for a custom max amp pack (Ah/pack size) the better hobby king packs are adequate.

Gotta love seeing the same concepts we use to build our rocket planks powering a fucking aeroplane.

Thanks for the links guys.
