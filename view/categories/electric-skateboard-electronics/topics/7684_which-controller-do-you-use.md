Hey All- Wondering what controller everyone uses? Use the comments to give us your thoughts on why you use one or why you don't use another. 

Thanks!

I'm testing this one right now and am planning to buy them wholesale to sell to the community. Been working great so far :)

I use one of these. Solid connection, two speed modes, and good throw on the thumb stick.

Yea, I'm loving the looser throttle, the far travel and the ergonomics. I also prefer thumb control over trigger. Battery also seems pretty great.

I think I'm using an older revision so I purchased a sample from the company to test out their new receiver with a wire antenna. If everything goes well it should be up for sale in October.

Curious about what everyone's "other" is aside from @Jinra 's Model?

Used this one from aliexpress for a while, really liked it: [url=http://de.aliexpress.com/item/2-4Ghz-mini-remote-controller-with-receiver-for-electric-skateboard-longboard/32607181070.html?isOrigTitle=true]2.5Ghz mini remote[/url],
guess it's the same one as the TB mini controller or the esk8.de mini remote (only a guess, they just look so similar), but looks like I killed the antenna of the receiver with vibrations, so using the "Quanum 2.4Ghz 3ch Pistol Grip Tx & Rx System" temporarily, which so far works too. 

Put in a vote for the TB mini controller, hope thats ok.

i use the chozen mod/penguin mod for the G2TB Controller made by @MasterCho. Its amazing, comes in a bunch of different colours and you don't have to de-solder the usb port for charging. Really useful and convenient

I never said controllers are for idiots.. 
I simply did it because it could be done.

Did that fix any of your issues with it?

It fixed the range issue but not the acceleration issue. The acceleration issue may be due to the ppm settings on the Vesc. It tended to maintain acceleration for half a second after punching it and letting go of the trigger while unloaded. While loaded (me on the board) I never punched it but felt a little lag on deceleration, however breaks were instantaneous. It may be natural behavior of a ppm controller but I never checked with my other RC controller. It may also be something in the Vesc settings. I ended up buying a nunchuck which doesnt have the deceleration lag.

Hey Jinra, how's the remote treating you? I'm thinking about getting one as well to replace the bulkier gt2b

Been pretty flawless so far. One of mine has a glitch where it may or may not connect when you first start it up, but my other one is fine. To fix, you just turn the remote off and on again, but it never disconnects while riding.

I was going to sell them on the forum, but they seem to be cheap and readily available on ali.

Yeah I noticed that but didn't see any activity since mid August so thought I'd ask to see how it was going or maybe I had missed it.

Yea I didn't update, because I never made a thread about it. It was just kind of word of mouth for the time being. I don't think I'll need to offer the remote personally, but I'll endorse it if people want to give it a try :)

I'm probably going to go ahead and order two then since I'm not digging how large the gt2b is even though it is very reliable, I'd rather have something a little more convenient. Speaking of which have you had any drops in signal?

As I said above, never disconnects while riding. Besides that small initial connection glitch, it works great.
