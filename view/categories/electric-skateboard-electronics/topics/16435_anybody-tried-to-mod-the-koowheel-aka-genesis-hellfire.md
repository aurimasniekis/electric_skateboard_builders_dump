The controller looks a little too jerky for me.

Yes I'd like to use the Benchwheel remote on the Koowheel. Just not sure how to do it.

I got my Koowheel yesterday and the remote is pretty good, not overly sensitive.

Been there done that, all those threads are just general info. Nobody yet that I've seen has done any mods to the Koowheel. Wondering if it's possible at all and how to do it.

At some point I'm going to swap out the  ICR18650-22F cells with 30Q's for a little more range, It's awfully hilly around here

Also I put a wireless charging receiver on the back of the remote with insulation tape and built it up to nice grip size :slight_smile:
