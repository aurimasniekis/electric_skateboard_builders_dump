Someone Else has already developed a Lithium battery with a solid non flammable electrolyte.

As much as I would like to believe this stuff. I will be may 15 to 20 years away before commercialization ever happens and why my enthusiasm for news like this is low.

No telling when we will actually see it on the market but still it is exciting news.
The future of lithium batteries is looking very bright.

Found this a while ago.. Li-S technology also looks promising.. let's see what future brings for us..

Would ''bring the size down'' about 2 times or so, for achieving the same range.. not entirely sure about discharge but yeh..

I wouldn't be surprised if a 10S2P becomes 4 times as light and 2 times smaller in the next few years.  It will be crazy to see where this expansive field brings us.
