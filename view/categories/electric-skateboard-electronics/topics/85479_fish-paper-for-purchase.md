Where to buy? Found the non adhesive stuff on amazon.... does it go by another name? Preferably something from amazon bc shipping is so fast... or mcmastercarr! Bought some braided copper and it showed up next day

Might help to add your location. @moon has a ton of fish paper (but he's in the EU) :slight_smile:

145ptags.com

The site itself is a messy abortion. but they're a good source for adhesive and plain fish paper.

Also search for barley paper.

I prefer the stuff that comes in rolls.

Any other names this goes by? I have a hard time imagining thereâ€™s not a really cheap alternative readily available on amazon.
