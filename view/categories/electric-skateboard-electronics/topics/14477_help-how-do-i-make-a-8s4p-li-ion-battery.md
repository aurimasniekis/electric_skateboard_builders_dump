I need help on making a 8s4p battery with 18650 samsung batteries for my first build. Ive watched hundreds of videos on making a diy 18650 battery pack but i still dont quite get on how to wire and solder the balance lead to the pack. I know that i have to make 4 8s pack in series and join them up in parallel. I havent found any videos on specifically 8s4p batteries so it would be nice if someone helps me make this. I also wanna see a full schematic of a of 8s4p with a bms because its i cant find one anywhere and it would really help a lot

If I may, I think he means the layout you desire. Can you show us a diagram or sketch. Do you already have an enclosure to work with?
