Hey guys,

What's the definitive answer on bypassing the BMS on discharge! I've read that it can unbalance the cells too much. Is this true? Or are you overall ok..

You're fine as long as you balance charge

and as long as you use quality cells with a suitable battery setup not to small.
Otherwise youÂ´ll get drifting cells and the vesc is not capable of handling that.
