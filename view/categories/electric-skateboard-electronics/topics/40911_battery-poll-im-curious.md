I have multiple batteries.
One 8S13P 1310Wh - 130A
One 10S4P 504Wh - 40A
One 10S4P 432Wh - 80A
One 12S10P 1512Wh - 100A

All custom made, the 4p are slim, 0.75in tall enclosure. Width depends on deck. Same with the 12S but 2 layers in a 1.5in enclosure. 

The 8S13P is a brick. Cells standing tall, in a 8x13 array.

@PXSS @ATLesk8 that seems like an excessive amount of batteries :joy:

Ive put in over 500 miles on one of my 10S2P 30Q packs. That's only less than 35 charge cycles, so the pack is still going strong. For the super super steep hills, you're going to get a tad of voltage sag, but otherwise it's been working marvelously for my purposes.

thats pretty good. i would do that in  about a month. lol
what kind of drivetrain do you have? 14miles on 222 whr is pretty good.

I have my vesc on 50A/60 batt/motor, but for the batt setting 40 works ok. 30a won't cut it on my hills...

I have 3 boards and then the 8S13P was a test battery that would have been disposed of at work otherwise...
