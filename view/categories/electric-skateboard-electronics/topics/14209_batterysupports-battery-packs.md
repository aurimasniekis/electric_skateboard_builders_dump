Hi first post as a new member. Would you be able to use X2 of these battery's in series connected to a bms for a general build?

Thanks

Unfortunately not. The max discharge of this pack is 5 amps, which is way too low for our needs.

Damn thanks for the reply. Is there any pre-built Li-Ion packs that would good for a build?

Yeah, tons.
@torqueboards @barajabali @elkick have li-ion packs with bms, etc.

You can just use this pack http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-37v-42v-5000mah-50ah-30a-lithium-ion-liion-battery-pack-p-376.html and you will have 10s2p with samsung 25rs. I've contacted Lilian before and she can modify it to be a flat pack or whatever dimension you aim for (providing it fits the cell and bms) as well as add a switch. I forgot to ask for a price but I would assume these additions will be < $50

@jwu97 I'm sure this is because I just don't understand esk8 batteries yet, but why would you use a 5000 mah battery that costs $138 over a zippy that costs $25?

A 25$ zippy is 3S, not 10S, it doesn't have a BMS or a soft switch wired to it either.

Not a battery expert by any means, but in addition to what @chinzw said, 18650s from reputable sources are much safer than pouch cell (zippys) and have a much longer life cycle. In term's of price to energy ratio, it is almost comparable to any zippys or any other quality lipo packs.

@chinzw Yeah I have read those guys do good batteries but most of them don't ship to New Zealand or have a big back order :confused:

You could try build your own, its not too hard if you do some research and are good at soldering or know anyone with a spot welder.
You can buy samsung 25r cells for 4$ a pop from illum.

In preference I'd prefer to avoid building my own pack. Due to the cost of a spot wielder (and not knowing anyone with one) but thanks for the suggestion XP

I was wondering if they would do that. I like their battery. I spent almost the exact same amount on lipos and their pack comes with a bms.

They'll do anything you request. They're very flexible with their products.
