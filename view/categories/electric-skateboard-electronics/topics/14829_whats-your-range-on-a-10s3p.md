cell type will make a huge difference - need to specify what cells/capacity are being used,

I have 10s3p
Samsung 25r cells
I weigh 70kg
Done the same run (2km hills 8km flat) usually keeping a steady 20km/h pace
Dual hubs= 10km used 60% *
Dual outrunners =10 km used 50%*
Sinhle belt drive = 10km used 40% *
*Approximately and Wind has a big effect on range
