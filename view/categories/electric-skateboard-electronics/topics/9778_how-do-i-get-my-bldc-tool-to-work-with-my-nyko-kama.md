Hey. So I have all my parts together for my [build](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/project-lite-electric-beer-pleb-build-beercan-board-single-tacon-245-10s-11600mah-25c-lipo-vesc-diy-mech-kit/4266/18) but I can't get my Nyko Kama to connect. I am running firmware version 2.18 for my VESC with a 230kv, 2650W motor, and a 10s battery. 

I can't get my Nyko Kama to move my motor. I soldered the receiver on to a 6pin JST connector and it lights up when powered up. It just won't work when I try to use the nunchuck. I have a feeling it has something to do with the BLDC tool because all the settings are daunting. Any advice? Thanks.
