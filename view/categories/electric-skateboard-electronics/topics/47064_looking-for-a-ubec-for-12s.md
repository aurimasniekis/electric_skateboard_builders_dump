I'd like to charge my shred lights while my board is on, I wonder what UBEC would you suggest for 12S and if Hobbyking sells it.

Are you trying to get to 12v or 5v?   What you need is a simple voltage regulator..many are adjustable too..does it charge through a usb? those are 5v

If it doesn't have to be from HK, there is also [TorqueBoards 12s UBEC](collections/esc-speed-controller-accessories/products/12s-ubec)...

I guess they charge at 5V but I need a female USB port to plug the USB cable, the Torqueboard one has different connectors

You can just cut any USB cable and use the red and black wires for 5v, not an issue..issue is finding one regulator that reaches 50v safety...I have used a larger regulator to get 12v and then into a smaller usb one, but there's some options out there for one device.. 

this might work: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0728KXFZV/ref=sspa_dk_detail_4?pd_rd_i=B071776Q5C&pd_rd_wg=ZsrXC&pd_rd_r=798XQ0VR2S70FQ8A2JF4&pd_rd_w=hVGr9&th=1

this too:  https://www.amazon.com/SMAKN%C2%AE-Converter-Voltage-MICRO-USB-Waterproof/dp/B00PXDEZ3C
 (just cut the wire and splice in the usb you need)

Yup, the buck converter in the first link should work.

Both of those links are rated for up to 50v and 12s fully charged is already 50.4v. Too risky.  In the first one you can even see the input cap rated for 50v.
I would suggest this one 

4 USB DC charger module 9V 12V 24V 36V 48V 60V to 5V 5A step down module with case for phone car free shipping
 http://s.aliexpress.com/rARV7RVF?fromSns=Copy to Clipboard 
(from AliExpress Android)

At least the input caps are rated for 63v
