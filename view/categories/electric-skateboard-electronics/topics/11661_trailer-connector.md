I had, what I thought, was a great idea.  Use a mail trailer connector on the motor aide and a female on the enclosure side.  Would make for a cool way to connect/disconnect your motor. But...the wire is 16 gauge on all they have at O'Reilys and Autozone.

I clicked this hoping someone made a bike trailer connector.

I thought of this too (while connecting my trailer last week) but you're right about the wire being way too small. I was thinking of using a regular computer power plug type connector, or these old Bulgarian aerospace connectors, rated to 560v and 80a! http://industrial-page.com/maep_products/4-pin-ussr-military-2rm-series-circular-thread-connector-male-female-set/

That is badass, would look great on a steam punk'd board. It looks huge though.

I think they are called mt60

XLR connectors might be a good option too.

XLR connectors are 15A max, but the newer Speakon connectors can handle 40A continuous which is actually usable (barely). I might try one.

I found some heavy duty 3 pin connectors on ebay http://www.ebay.com/itm/3-pin-F20-USSR-Military-Connector-Plug-Male-Female-Set-1pcs-/261269534935?hash=item3cd4e0b8d7:g:ItgAAMXQ83xSFP04
It's from the USSR, so it will either never break, or explode spectacularly.

That's just scary looking :smile:.   I'm looking at http://www.hobbyking.com/mobile/viewproduct.asp?idproduct=66803 right now.  I think it will look good mounted in the elephant 008 case I'm currently working g with.
