NEED HELP! My friend created a keyway slot on my Turnigy 6374 motor, it so happens that after he finish the job, he placed my motor on top of a tabled that had many metal shaving from him doing his normal job. So, my motor got full of metal shavings all over and INSIDE OF THE INSIDE MAGNETS. I've watched so many youtube video on dissasembling the motor. Any way, i took out the 4 main screws around the barrel and i've pulled so much that only about a 1/5 of the 74mm only comes out. I've tried using two screw drivers to try and pulling apart the motor but no luck.
My question is, CAN SOMEONE PLEASE SHARE IF THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF TAKING THE MOTOR APART? Pictures and videos would help if available.

Cleaned out all the shavings but black ring fan got loose, can it be crazy glued back where it belongs? It clearly shows where it was glued at. Feeling very frustrated, i haven't even turn motor on for the first time yet and this happens, brand new, got it two days ago

Do u have better pic of black fan thing? I assume the outer part can be left as it is..if it does not interfere. Otherwise probably try to pry it back..

Bad luck what else to say..

the black holes you see on fan is where the outer casing gets screwed back in.

Hi T,

As far as I can see, that black fan part is meant to be loose when the outer drum is removed.
Once you refit the drum, put those screws back in and refit the C clip, all will be well.
Not sure what glue residue you are looking at but that's what I'm seeing.

Ah yes. Looks like a bearing to give the motor drum some extra support via the black fan part. I'd give it a light smear of contact adhesive at most.
It's only to stop the fan slipping on the bearing.
If the fan is a sticky fit onto the remaining glue residue, it needs nothing.

Andy.

You could but it depends what you want to switch with it.
I doubt it's rated for switching your main power but might be ok for turning a VESC on and off.

Just Googled it and it's only suitable for 100-125v AC. This means even if you found a use for it on your board, the light isn't compatible.

Hi T,

I don't use the VESC and you don't need a BMS with those Li-Po's.

Take a look at my build log to see what I did.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-first-and-second-oops-electric-longboard-build-log/13712

Looks like there are a few similarities with our projects.

Andy.

for on off switch'es you should look at getting a VEDDER spark switch from chaka/diy/etc, they are designed for your purpose
