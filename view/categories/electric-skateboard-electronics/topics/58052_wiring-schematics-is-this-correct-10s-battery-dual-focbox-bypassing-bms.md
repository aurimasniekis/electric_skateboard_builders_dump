As the title states I would like to have someone check to see if my wiring is correct. 
Question 1: Is the loop key in the right place?
Question 2: Where does the voltage meter go?
Question 3: Will this bypass the BMS for discharge?

Here is the BMS

No; you want the loop key on the negative line, between battery negative and ESC negative.  Also it helps to make thick lines 10AWG and thin lines 22AWG

Yes, this is in "bypass" configuration.  The voltmeter goes in parallel to the ESCs, just like if you had a third ESC, but it can use 22 - 26 AWG wire

Thanks, I'll redraw it real quick. :grin:

Does this look better?

Yes; except the wire from the battery to the BMS "B-" doesn't have to be 10AWG because P- is not connected.  22AWG is okay

Pay attention to the BMS if it starts "B0, B1, B2" or "B1, B2, B3"

Some need the B- to be the same as B0 and some start with the next cell for B1

I think it doesn't matter the side of the Antispark loop, plus I would rather leave my electronics grounded with the positive disconnected. Just my 2Â¢

The schematic looks good, but for future reference when drawing crossing wires, to designate they aren't connected, draw the wire like the Omega symbol as if the wire is "going over"

Is there any way to tell which one it starts with or is it just trial and error?

Do you know which BMS it is or have a photo or both?

I haven't bought it yet I was thinking about using this one.

Yeah that one has 11 connections instead of 10, so B0 through B10 or 0V through 42V, as opposed to 4.2V through 42V

Your diagram only has ten balance wires and not eleven

I'll draw it again, brb.

Also the series connections between the batteries need to be large wire

So, when I was sketching I couldn't figure out which ground wire I needed to connect to B0. Could I get some help? 1 is for the main wire and 2 is the smaller one in the middle

V3:  Alright, I think it's complete. Hopefully third times a charm. :sweat_smile:

Hi, can anyone just take a quick look at this whirring and tell me if it is right(I will bypass the BMS). Do I nead the black whier form battery 2 to B- on the BMS?
this is the BMS i use.
