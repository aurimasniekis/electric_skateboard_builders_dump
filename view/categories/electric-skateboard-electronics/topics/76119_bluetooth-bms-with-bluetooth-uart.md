Found this BMS while browsing alibaba

I ordered one for science. 


Do you think it's possible to use the BMS UART port to communicate with the VESC ? If there was a communication between the controller and the BMS it would be fantastic . Like in EV

I have one installed on my CGT. I love it I'll never use one without bluetooth again.

EDIT: there is also a huge thread on endless-sphere about this BMS that I found:
