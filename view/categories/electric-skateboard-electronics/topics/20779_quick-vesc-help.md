Sounds like a adapter for hall sensor.
Can you provide a picture?

It fits into the hall port or the program/debug port
My hall sensors are open cables so i would need to know if i can simply unpin this connector or if i need it for something else than the hall bus

That is a hall sensor adapter cable for sure. You don't need it if the hall sensor cables fit right on the VESC hall bus.
Actually, I need a cable like that so if you're putting it on a shelf somewhere, I can buy it from you.
