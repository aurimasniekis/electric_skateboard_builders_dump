I'm in the process of upgrading my Raptor 1 with FOCBOXs and have it all hooked up. I have the master FOXBOX plugged into my computer via USB but nothing is showing up on the BLDC tool. Please Help!

Id recommend the official vedder vesc 6 tool.  I find its very effective and quite nice.

Make sure that the USB your using can do data transfers, also check the connection between the USB and the focbox.
