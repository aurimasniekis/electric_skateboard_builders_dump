One of the batterys where charged a little less than the rest so all the others where putting all the loltege through that one to keep up and it killed it, this wasn't the first time this has happened and I didn't know why before the solution it to have all batterys fully charged before riding so they all drain evenly but I'm also gonna get a bms to help with this

11V is not enough charge.. you need to charge each pack to at least 12V, 12.6V max

and charge all the packs to the same level. don't have different voltage packs in series.
