So I was having an issue with a d140 BMS not balancing one of the banks, so I ordered a replacement from Litechpower and payed a ridiculous amount in shipping since buildkitboards was out of stock.  (I ordered 2 and figured I'll sell the other one on here if anyone needs one.)

Both of them arrived today, however they don't look like my old one I have or the picture of what I ordered.  See picture for differences.  What are these missing components?  Are they just an unnecessary component in a 10s setup?  ![litech%20order|690x275](upload://uAH4h6hO7jg6OdxOtIsqcMsMWbD.jpeg) 

This is the link to exactly what I ordered:

I believe the missing parts you see are the Fets that the BMS uses to disconnect the charger. So it just has less because its only a 15 amp BMS. I assume there would be more Fets if it was rated for higher amperage. They are all just wired In parallel with one another to raise the working current ratings.

OK awesome, hopefully that's the case!  I have an email out to Litech as well, but figured I'd get a quicker response here to put my mind at ease :)

Was your other BMS a charge only model as well? I see there are other components missing other then just the Fets.

Yes the old one was also a charge only BMS, and I noticed that too!  I did find another thread on here with someone else with a bestech 10s BMS and it looked like my new one with the differences.  I hope these things are good to go!

In case anyone is following, this was the official response from Litechpower.  I guess the one I had previously actually did support discharge even though it was purchased as a "charge only" BMS:

> The pictures on our website are a sample, just for reference.
> 
> Our BMS is customized according to the customer's requirements. The model you ordered has no discharge function, so there is no discharge mosfet.
