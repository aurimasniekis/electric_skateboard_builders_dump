Do you need an anti spark plug if running two 5s in series or can u directly plug the series connector into the vesc?

no you don't need one. the spark makes sure you are ready to ride! :100:

an anti spark plug would make it less :boom:

```
if you can´t solder than a vedder anit spark switch or similar with pre soldered plugs would be your best bet, but if they don´t have precharge circut they will fail sooner or later.
if you use a discharge bms with a build in switch that would work too.

Not really as i‘m not a fan of anti spark e-switches. 

If you need an xt90s anti spark or a loopkey, maybe you can just post pictures from where it should be installed and which plugs coming from battery and which on the escs and somebody can solder you something.
