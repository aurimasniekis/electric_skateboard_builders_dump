EU guys, what options do we have with 10s fanless charger with 4A or more here?
Just realised non of our vendors does have chargers in their shops! @fottaz @esk8 @okp (has a 2A)  @ProtoBoards (are you still alive bro?) (sorry if i missed someone)

Do you all buy from oversea or do you have a nice local tip?

@TarzanHBK bro I can't seem to find any options in the US that are decently priced. Apparently 10s 5a chargers have gold in them!

nice info!
But looks like it does have a fan, and you have to solder a 5.5 plug on it.
There are also a few options on ebay, but non of them is fanless with the right plug

because you said "up to 50V", for 10s we need 42V, sooo should be adjustable somehow i think :smiley:

@MontPierre 
I must say, that this is one nice built PSU in alu chassis :slight_smile:
It has a fan though, but it dosn´t run when powering up the psu, so maybe it is temp. controlled ?
Even the instructions is well made, and not the typical "chinglish" language.
Comes with two extra fuses as well.

It has two LED`s. One for power, and one for chraging status. Nice :slight_smile:

Just FYI, there are bunch of chargers exactly like that one from Banggood @Silverline mentioned.

And not only for 10S. Just search AliExpress, for example "cutoff_voltage charger". I was looking for 8S therefore "33.6V charger". You can get different charging current variants as well.. 3A, 4A, 5A, 7A.

[This seller](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1728275?spm=2114.search0104.3.108.DKSONG) has a bunch, browse through his store...

Do you know how the fan is working BTW: ?

Yes, the fan is temperature controlled. It turns on and off multiple times during charging. Doesn't yours? If not, think about contacting the seller about this.

IWell Its only 3A. Not sure how much your batteries can take but I have this one 

36V 37V 42V 45V 5A Battery Charger For 10s 10x 3.6V/3.7V Lithium Li-ion Battery
https://banggood.app.link/MfningHZAH

Works very well and charges quickly. Had to charge plug to match my socket on the board - 2 minutes soldering job ;)

 Charges my lipos 10s 8000mah in an hour from approx 35-36 V

I thought 3A might be good since it's more then 2A so charges quicker but less then 4A so longer life.

Yeah, it depends on how many C you can charge your batteries with. Mine don’t get warm at all during charge so I know I’m fine, I’m not abusing mine ;)

Will I be abusing my 10s4p 30q battery when I charge it with 5a?! 
I thought the recommended charging current was 1.5A per battery times 4p so 6a?

A nice tip from our friend @chaka

[quote="chaka, post:31, topic:2087"]
Charging li-ion cells: Divide the packs watt hours by a factor of 2 and find a charger that matches that number. You don't want to charge faster than 0.5C
[/quote]
```

## \#42 Posted by: koralle Posted at: 2017-11-28T23:47:25.644Z Reads: 89

10s4p: 360wh divided by two - 180

charger: 36v x 5a = 180w

Does that mean it is still fine (the charger says 36(42)v)?

If not, my 10s4p battery just became 10s5p :-/
```

You have 30Q batteries, right ? 
Let's go like this:
(nominal) (36V x 3000 mAh)/1000  = 108 Wh (per 10 s) 
4 in parallel so 108 Wh x 4 = 432 Wh
Giving chaka's guideline. 432 / 2 = 216 Watts charging.
216 / 36V gives you 6 amps.

So your 5 amps should be clear of spec.

Edit: If I interpolate this on my 10s3p. I should only use 3,74 amps. The quick-charger is still the same at 4 Amps. Been using this for over a year with no noticeable degradation of the battery. So you even have some moving room.

I have a similar charger from Ali express. My fan doesn’t spin up when the psu is powered on, but as soon as I plug it in! FFS it goes loud AF
