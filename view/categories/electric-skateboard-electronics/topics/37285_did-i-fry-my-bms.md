So im in the process of putting an extra space sell into an encloser i ordered from Unik and by accident once of the leads that connects to the switch touched one of the battery terminals, i saw no sparks but i heard a small chirp and now my battery wont turn on... i have another BMS but it dosnt have a built in switch and i didnt want to have to use an anti spark xt90 plug.
