So I'm connecting a bms for the first time and want to make sure I don't mess it up. From what I know, ch- is for the negative from the charging port, p- is the negative for power output, and B- is the negative lead from the battery. And then I just connect the red wire from the charger to the red battery lead. But I've never seen a bms with two holes for B- and P-. I can use either one right? And aside from the balance connector that's all I need to do?
