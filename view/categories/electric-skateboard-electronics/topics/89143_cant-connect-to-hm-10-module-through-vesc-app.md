Hi,

I have just bought an HM-10 module hoping that I can use it to see realtime data about my vesc. I tried to do this previously but thought the module might have been fake (clearly not as I get the same results now). I have connected the module to the VESC (Vcc to 3.3v, GND to GND, Tx to Rx and Rx to Tx) as well as set the input to ADC and UART and set the Baud rate to 9600. When I try and connect via the vesc app, it can find the HM-10 module but when I press connect, it stays grey for a few seconds and then goes back to an 'unconnected' state. I can't connect to it from Android settings either. Any help appreciated!
