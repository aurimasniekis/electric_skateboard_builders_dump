Haha sorry man, I was just being a dick. 

If it’s noisy it could have a busted bearing or some grit or stones in there.

 If it’s not running the detection make sure all connections are good and there is no load on the motor

Like a bike hub motor or mid drive? They are pretty big. I would try using a lot more amps for detection. The VESC standard is 5-10amps bump it up by 10 or 20amps.

Dude, what about beeing precise? A Motor can be noisy due to many problems. It would be the Best if you tell us some Details an provide some pictures like @Andy87 said....

1. Pictures 
2. Do you know the Name of the Motor 
3. Which Esc do you use exactly 
4. Did the Motor worked already once?
5. If so, when did it get noisy?

Dude, people can’t help if you can’t provide sufficient details. 
Please edit the post to include pictures, videos, motor specs, vesc settings, etc.

If it is only noisy in bldc then it’s probs just the wine of the motor. If you can take a video we can help otherwise we can’t.
