I bought two of these 46v batteries through facebook marketplace off someone who wrecked his Ebike. The batteries test at 54.2v (he sent them freshly charged I guess). Can anyone help me identify the odd looking serial battery connector that this has? Also the bullet connector for the charging port. It measures in at 8.1mm for the outer barrel, and 1.6mm for the inner barrel hole. I plan to use these two batteries for a mountainboard build. I also already tried to look up the information on the sticker with no luck.
