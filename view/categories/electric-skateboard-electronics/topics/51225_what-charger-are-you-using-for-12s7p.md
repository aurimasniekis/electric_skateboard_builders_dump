Regular are 2 amp chargers and most people with big batteries use 4amp charger and a few use 5amp chargers.

I am using a YZ Power charger, works pretty well, and it has an internal fan.

i dont really want to open a new thread sincei  have the same question, what chargers are people using for their 12s builds. i came across this charger but it states 50.4v and 44.4v, though im using 30Q cells in 12s7p config and that comes to 3.7v per cell if it really does charge to 44.4v is their a charger similar to this one that anyone would recommend. or would this charger be fine to use ?

Get a 50.4v charger. That means that it is charging every cell to 4.2, which is what you want @krazor

Yeah conservatively that's like 800Wh or 210Ah at 3.7V or about 16Ah at 50V so if you charge at 16A it would be 1C charge rate and would take about an hour at 5A you're looking at a bit over 3 hrs (16/5), lower you go longer you'll need to wait to actually fill it up.  Maybe not an issue if you charge overnight but I like to be conscious and not too far when juicing things up.

yeh defiantly not... 1c for lipos is well and truly enough unless they are multiple packs in para i would like to go to 8-10 amp but that type of charger will be pretty pricey and i probably would be better off using a balance charger since it will be far cheaper lol

as someone mentioned earlier a few more amps would charge the board a lot faster so i was thinking instead of a 4amp as i thought thats all i could find. i did manage to find some 6-8 ampg chargers, what are your thoughts on something like this 42v 6amp charger. https://www.dhgate.com/store/product/yzpower-auto-stop-42v-8a-lithium-battery/402731760.html?skuid=352989577428189190

will it actually charge to my batteries full capacity or will it cut off .3v early?

correct, i was wondering if its any good. though as i mentioned my battery is 42.3v and this has an auto cut off at 42v. would it still charge my battery to full or would it only charge it to like 97%

when your 12s battery is full, it will be 50.4v, or 100%. When you use a 42v charger your battery will be charged to 42v...or 83%

I have noticed most of these charger actually charge to 42.x like 42.5 or so.  Just an observation.

For 7p I would get a Waouks 6amps off amazon and most likely have to change the connector on it.

hmmm i think i might have screwed that up then.... i think ive been looking at this wrong. 12*3.6=43.2v thats for the 30Q cells at 3.6v each cell that is the minimum voltage isnt it... how do you determine the max voltage?

i think what im missing is, if i do get a 42v charger will it charge the battery to its max capacity or am i looking at the wrong chargers and i actually need a 50.4v charger?

A liion cell is fully charged at 4.2 volts, and if you have 10 cells fully charged, That‚Äôs 10x4.2= 42 volts. If you have 12 cells fully charged, that‚Äôs 12x4.2=50.4 volts. 

Edit: which pack to do have? If it‚Äôs 10s then you need 42v charger. If it‚Äôs 12s then you need 50.4v charger

## \#31 Posted by: krazor Posted at: 2018-10-27T23:37:17.681Z Reads: 114

ahh ok so i was misunderstanding. 3.6 is the minimum voltage and 4.2 is the max gotcha. for my next question. with chargers specifically. can you fully charge a 12s pack with a 42v charger or will it not charge at all?

reason being is. i found a 42v 8amp charger and a 50.4v 6 amp charger. im sure you can see where i want to lean towards. the 8amp charger for quicker charge times but that 6 amp is still an improvement ontop of  the 4amp 1 i found yesterday.

No you need a 50.4v charger to charge your pack to the max. Also I think the minimum discharge is 2.8 volts for liion. @Sender  is that right?

yea I'm that smart ass, sorry to have offended but your egregious price seemed to warrant a response. 

if I needed a charger I'd get this one, 8amps, adjustable voltage to 60v so works with 10s or 12s

I'm not mad atchu u shouldve just linked this one first and not one that didn't fit the statement u were trying to make.. People have options and some have particular levels of "disposable income" and although a particular item maybe cheaper or even a better performer it could just be something fits a particular look theyre looking for...

Btw..... 0% charge for liions is 2,5 v, but not recommended to discharge that low, so people usually don't discharge till no more than 2,8-3,0 volts.

Do you sell charger with AU plug, I don't want any, adapters. Or if it just takes the standard PC plug I can just use 1 from here since they are only like $4 but I also need to know what charging pins it has so I can get the same. I'm after a GX16-3 pin or even 2 pin specifically.

Idk where you heard that but it does charge all the way to 50.4V.  That is the voltage that comes out.  It works great and it hasn't had any issues.  The case is plastic but having a fan on it is a nice touch.

So if a pack is 8p and you are using an 8a charger, is it effectively like charging each individual cell at 1a? This should be fine for battery life right? Or am i missing something?
