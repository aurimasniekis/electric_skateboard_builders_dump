Is there any benefit to using extra capacitors on the battery side of a vesc? I assume less voltage sag but does it make a difference? Or does making the battery current travel through more wires cancel that out?

Supposed to be important for voltage spikes with extended battery wires:

I was wondering the same thing the other day when I saw a lot of people's build had the extra capacitors at the ESC.

I also noticed the capacitors built onto the Enertion Vesc, does this ESC need more capacitors, or are the board capacitors there for this very reason?ðŸ¤”
