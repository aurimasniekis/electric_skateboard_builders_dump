Ok, this is my first foray into a BMS.  Prior to this I had just used a smart charger and hoped VESC would shut down when it was supposed to.  But I've been using LiFePo's 

The pack is a 10S5P of the LG HG2 18650's.  Is this the right BMS?

[HCX-D298V1](http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/BMS-D298V1.html)

Is there a better alternative you'd recommend?

Thanks,

DougM

Thanks.  Dumb question, but how do you actually buy it?  I don't see a buy method on their website.  I did send an email to sales.

There's also this one, which I can get on eBay right now but will take 28 days to arrive.

[suPower  	 706551622448](http://www.ebay.com/itm/36V-37V-42V-10S-60A-Lithium-ion-Li-ion-Li-Po-LiPo-Polymer-Battery-BMS-PCB-System-/221769582503?hash=item33a27f47a7)

doesn't appear to be programmable, though.
