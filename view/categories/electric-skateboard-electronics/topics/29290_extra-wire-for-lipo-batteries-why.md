It's balance cable (use search) it should be also in lower battery.

That is the balance cable like Tuomalar says.
You need that to charge the battery. Im pretty sure the below one has them too

Like said above the extra wire is for balancing the individual cells in the battery. The connector is a JST-XH. Might I suggest that since all the batteries are on sale for a good price that you choose the higher c rating of at least 30c instead.

Good luck
