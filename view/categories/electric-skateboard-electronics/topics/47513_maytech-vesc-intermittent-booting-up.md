Hi, my Vesc is now intermittent. Blue light on VESC when I opened up enclosure then no connection with Vesc Tool.
Then randomly light changed to normal and remote worked.

So, now I have to turn the vesc on and off about 15 times for it to work correctly. What would cause this!!?
I changed some parameters within the Vesc Tool (I was playing it safe before so was advised on here to change some parameters). I then took a ride for a few miles and it was pulling great and totally fine. Then next day, turned it on an nothing. Then I opened it up and took pics. The turned of and on a few times to try to connect to vesc tool and failed. Then randomly started working. Rode it for a further 8 miles totally fine. Now it takes 10-15 goes at powering on.

Any ideas!?

I got Vesc from eskate.eu in Italy.

Make sure the problem is not HW related so check connectors, BMS and battery than move on to the VESC because. it is easier to check connectors just unplug everything maybe check voltages and plug it back, see if it changes anything.

what is you method of "On/Off"?
-loop key
-eswitch
-plain ole plug and go
?

Its an e-switch with built in anti-spark

soo when you go for a ride while this is going on...does it cut out on you?

EDIT; i kinda wanna say its a short somewhere.  i know when i F up on an arduino wire up and try to connect  via serial (usb) it doesn't connect or power up. does the LED come on immediately then goes out right away?

you have multi-meter?

I have a multimeter but Ive not probed around yet.
When it powers on eventually, its fine! No cut outs or anything.

here is what i would do...
test starting from battery...
then eswitch...

if you have a fuse DBL check it is not 1/2 blown.

I had an issue like yours once and it was due to a faulty receiver. The vesc would randomly cut out in split second intervals, and after a while it just broke. Maybe try a different pair and try running the motors using the vesc tool. I changed to an rc car remote and it went fine. ðŸš™

as far as that avenue... this is all i can see that may or may not add clout. (the backside looks good)

being that having trouble connecting via serial usb i wouldn't think so, but if you had another remote around its worth a shot.

You rode with all that heatshrink still on?!

You should NEVER ride with heatshrink. First thing I did when preparing for the first ride was removing any and all heatshrink. You probably cooked something in the process. The vesc needs all the air it can get. Leaving it encased in heatshrink only guarantees disaster. Just my 2c.

It seems I'm the only one rocking maytech vescs without any major problems for a year around here.

Yeah, Ive been riding with heatshrink on. Ive never seen anything mentioned about removing it but Ill take it off as you suggest. I've studdied the results from the Metr app after the last few rides and the Vesc did get up to 78 deg when going up a long steep hill. I then swapped back to 90mm (from 100mm MBS) to see if it'd take the strain away. It did, so Ive currently got a 42T in the post to replace my 36T so there will be more torque and less heat. 

Possibly Ive cooked something but I cant understand why it'll work sometimes and not others. I'll get a closer look this evening.

If it's an intermittent issue, try flexing the PCB and see if the VESC starts responding again. It may be a bad solder joint.

Is anything heating up when the VESC is not responsive?

It seems to me you fried the drv. Try typing faults in the console(?) tab and see if it returns anything. 
You also may or may not have shorted motor phase leads.
At this point I would just get a new vesc or replace the drv.

This may be the excuse ive been waiting for to buy the FocBox.

Im almost 100% sure that its a loose connection and that the VESC is fine.
I've discovered that when I turn on the board with wheels on floor, its fine everytime. When I turn it on with board on its back, it fails to boot. Must be something loose thats stopping it from booting up (yet still gives it power to the led).

Then check your connectors for anything suspicious, cold solder joints for example.

Yeah, Id have done it already but I cant get the bolts off the enclosure lol
Im afraid of rounding them out so Ive just ordered fresh new torx socket set.
Too much of the old thread lock ;)

Most people have the heat shrink on, me included. 
No issue. 
First time I heard a recommendation to remove it.

If you have a good heatsink on the top and bottom of the FETS would you still need to remove the heatshrink?

I'd say no. You already solved a big part of the problem. I would be a little worried about the drv though. If it gets cooked you're dead. Then again.. I may be too cautious just because I run maytechs xD

So do I need to heatsink the drv as well? Seems like that's what everybody burns...not the mosfets.

AFAIK there is no way you can put a heatsink on the drv. Only on the fets

WRONG. my heatsink cools the fets and the drv. itâ€™s a bit ghetto but just find the thickest thermal pads you can find and stack until they contact the drv and heatsink. it helps a crazy amount

also about this heatshrink thing... i donâ€™t think thatâ€™s true...
i rode both my vescs with heatshrink without an issue. why would the manufacturer spend the extra $$ if it negatively effected the performance? if youâ€™re pushing your vescs so hard that heatshrink becomes a problem, you need to change your settings...

Well, that's one way to do it...

About that.. I'd rather take the heatshrink off and not be thrown off my board because of a piece of plastic than keeping it on and faceplanting thank you very much.

Maytech vescs make you paranoid(in every positive sense of the word).

if the vesc overheats it doesnâ€™t slam the brakes. iâ€™ve experiences it. it thermal throttles just like a computer. it will not push itself to death, unless something in your setup is wrong.

Same here. I've had some weird moments when I had cutouts and such. But those issues were non vesc related. 
There is a common misconception that maytechs are so bad you should never go near them. I say it depends on the person himself. If you respect your hardware and treat it like you do there is no room for failure. Same goes for batteries. _Especially **lipo's**._

I have a maytech vesc and itâ€™s been working great. I had a problem in the beginning, I was having intermittent cut out problems. It powered up normally but after I was rolling it would start stuttering   The problem was that the receiver was too close to the vesc.  Itâ€™s now located as far as the receiver cable will allow.  Itâ€™s working great now, no probs. This is just my 2 cents

Same here. 

I've not used my board for about two weeks. Recently I started boarding again and was having cut outs. I moved the receiver around and it got a little better. Before this the receiver was in the same place and I had zero problems. After a few days no more jittering/stuttering at speed. Guess it was just a little rusty. :rofl:

So, yeah... this Maytech makes no sense. Acts like a loose connection. Intermittent issues of booting up correctly (blue and a green when signal detected) and not booting up and displaying blue and red light side by side. LED battery display works and shows % correctly. All voltages are good. Its like it just sometimes kicks in and sometimes won't.
Thing thats so weird is that when it finally works (after 15min of on/off, rotating it, moving it away from other stuff. restarting controller, lying it on its back, on its front...) when it works, it works for miles. No cut outs. No judders. No issues. Its like its totally a boot up software issue and when it finally boots ok, its perfect.

So, feck it. I need a Focbox. 
Why on earth are they sooooooo expensive!?

Hmm.. My vesc was having cutouts and jittering at high speed. Turned out to be a receiver problem. Seems to me you've got a bad batch of vesc. Maybe it's something that you did recently that triggered it? My jittering and cogging problem began when i disconnected the motor for service. 
My maytech has been running strong for about a year. Nothing major I can't fix. (I'm lucky I know hehe)
