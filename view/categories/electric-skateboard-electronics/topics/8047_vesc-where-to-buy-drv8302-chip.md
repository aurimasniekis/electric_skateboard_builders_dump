Can be bought from Mouser or Digikey if you are in the US and willing to take challenge of resoldering. Chip is made by Texas Instruments. There is a solder pad underneath DRV chip.

Correct chip is the DRV8302DCA. You had the link to the DRV8302DCAR; I forgot what the R stands for in the product code though I did asked the question before.

the R is for the package type. In this case it mean that you need to other a minimum quantity of 2000. But there is no difference electrical difference.
