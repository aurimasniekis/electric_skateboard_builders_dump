Hello, i got a liftboard single motor as a gift after a few months riding i tried to connect my controller but it wont connect. I have zero experience with ESK8 i start to read and decided ask for help. 
I attached a picture from the ESC (I guess)

I don't know any of the details from the board. 

Can someone give me the details off the board (if its a ESC/VESC) ?

Can i just buy another transmitter and change it? 

If its only the transmitter replace which one do i need to buy? any other cables that i need to buy as well?

How can I know if its not the transmitter and i might need i new VESC ?


Thank you
HBS
