those look exactly the same as sold by diyelectricskateboards and others on alibaba except they have a winning logo.  
you should find the kv.  there are reviews somewhere on here.  I have a lot of thoughts i'll keep most to myself as I'm biased but I think the way the rubber is attached is sketchy and especially as it's just polyurethane and they rate the motors to a really high temp...polyurethane breaks down at 170f.    wattage ratings are always bogus or maybe what could be put out for 2 seconds before meltdown

also curious how big long the stator is.  I've read 30mm...but if you add 3cm from the end of the hanger aluminum there's not enough room to fit a nut on the end.  Maybe the bearing is sitting on the threads and even then I doubt you can fit 3cm of stator in.  Maybe the stator is sitting up on the hanger, must be otherwise no way.

I thought that instantly aswell. I am sure they are diyelectricskateboards but only the new version. Winning make them so i am not scared about being terrible as i have talked to them before. 130Kv they said. I also think the rubber is sketchy but they offer spares for 4$.

I can show you a video of them assembling the board.

This is their previous model which looks exactly like diys

i think there's a juicy story as I remember when diy started to sell them he said he stopped all the other sellers from selling them, and if I remember correctly that seemed to happen for a bit.

Yeah im sure he tried but i think its impossible to tell a factory in china to stop producing something. I have sent the factory a few emails to try and see whats going on:worried:

I don't ever see people talk about tb hubs anymore. I just got some hummie hubs (arrived today) interested to see how they perform, still a bit skeptical on the durability of hubs.

80mm diameter and 56 long kegel match. 
The future motors will be 80x101 !!!  A single with 150% the power of the two.  I will stop selling the 80x56 as soon as the last aluminum are gone
90k
