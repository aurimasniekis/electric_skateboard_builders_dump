Folks lets start a thread on JUST motors.

everyone should post (with pics preferably) what motorvation they have on their cruiser.  Any PROS or CONS, where you bought it or them, cost, and would you recommend it's use.

lets keep this thread as objective as possible.

I'll be first

I have not been able to use these yet because of VESC issues (there's plenty to talk about, but thats for another thread.)  Brand is obvious, quality seems good, well made.  Most expensive motor I have seen on the Eskateboard market.  Seller claims the extra cost is justified by the quality and will manifest itself in longevity (only time will tell.)  Good looking motor, but expensive.  Can't recommend it yet since I haven't used them yet.

Turnigy 245kv G160 motor

I've built several boards using these motors, as well as hooked a couple of friends with them. They all have lasted the the test of time. 
They are rated to 10s, come with a flat spot beveled on the shaft, have three 16mm bearings and are fairly compact in length. Definitely possible to do dual motor set ups on 195mm trucks.
$75 bucks!

They also have the 290kv model which hit the 50mph mark @ 8s on one of my boards.

Turnigy SK3 6364. 245kv. 8s and a 14T/60T with 129mm pneumatic wheels. I selected this motor and setup for high torque vs high top speed and it turned out great. I just climbed the steepest, longest hill in my area and the motor was barely warm at the top. I have about 35 miles of total travel on it so far. I paid $80 on HK. They don't stay in stock for very long. The shaft doesn't have a keyway or a flat spot, so BYOD (Bring Your Own Dremel).

it does have  bit of wobble. the wobble is all in the fat flange though and not in the tooth area, so i'm not sure yet if its going to be a problem or not. i guess its a flaw in the pressing since these are ctually multiple parts pressed together, or it could be an irregular flange. The shaft is true though, and the teeth seem to be as well.

Ok, so I've been able to test my motors and I'm ready to report.

as I mentioned on my build thread, unless you live in a hilly town dual drive is unnecessary.  I feel I could have easily gotten away with one of these motors.  After extensive modification of the settings on the VESC I've finally tamed this thing.  This dual drive setup has more power than I'll ever need.

so final report, they are expensive but they do make tons of power.

With the overwhelming recommendations for dual drive on this forum and the fact that the larger r-spec motors are twice as much as an equivalent sk3 motor, it's not that surprising.

## \#17 Posted by: cmatson Posted at: 2016-01-09T16:48:22.230Z Reads: 245

```

the main problem, as @claudiofiore88 said, is that you can buy a 6374 sk3 for $80, or the equivalent R-spec for $150.. I get that it's a beast, but that doesn't change the fact that it is pretty expensive.

I still think it is a pretty good middle ground between dual motor and single drive. It is basically the max you can get out a single motor setup, yet it is still way cheaper than dual.

The main question would be how it compares to the equivalent turnigy option, and then from there is it worth another $70?

I have actually discovered that Maytech uses another manufacture for their motors. They are essentially a "middle man" hence the abnormally high price of the R-spec motors. I began to suspect this when they started offering me other components such as the china brand eboarding remote etc. I believe they are made by Sunpower located in Shenzen.  I am still investigating this since I would rather not sell motors at double the retail value.

The tacon 160 motors are actually larger than the r-spec. The r-spec is a variant of the Tacon 110. I  think we could probably get hobbypartz.com to carry a 190kv version for us if we press them hard enough.

```
The torque generated by a brushless DC motor is proportional to the current times the number of turns.
For a given motor size and a given current, a motor with more turns will generate more torque.
For a given motor size, lower kv ratings will have more turns.
Hence, for the same motor size and a given current, a lower kv motor will generate more torque.

yeah but that 295 will have higher top end, so if you fiddle with the ratios you can get decent startup torque and still have a higher top speed.

I'll tell you what justified the price difference of the 6355 R-SPEC for me:

 - Electrically speaking, 12S batteries made most sense to keep currents and thus heat losses low, 190kv is almost ideal.
 - The R-spec comes with a keyway and 2 circlips to keep your pulley in place. Makes a lot of sense mechanically.
 - The R-spec has nice flexible silicone wires, hobby motors often just have the stiff winding wire extended outside the housing

In a given motor series, the longer the length, the more torque it can produce.

The R-spec motor is the smallest of the three motors in this series. It actually has a sweet spot in the KV range of 230KV and the max output is reduced when it is wound to a lower or higher KV

Adding sensors is kinda complicated, so I'll forgo explaining it here. There are a lot of resources online that could probably explain it better than me. I think endless-sphere had a couple of how-to's on this. Plus, I'm still experimenting with sensors.  As for VESC's, they can be used with sensors. Although, I have not attempted that yet.

Have you guys re-oiled/greased the bearings of the motors.

I tend to do it every month or so. Motors seem to come back to life after all the dust and grime that get's stuck on the motors. Same as regular wheel bearings. Monthly clean down changes things. I just put some in the bearing from the top of the motor and spin them on the bench.

I've been doing it since forever. RC motors last.. Just as long as a short doesn't occur, your motor wire connector doesn't fall off and no wires get cut. I still have my very first motors when I started 3 years ago.

onloop writes that the bearings are different and better.  
he claims better steel in the stator as well...i wonder what chemical composition it is that makes it better. 
I also wonder how thin the laminations as he says they're thinner,  and what the airgap is and what the magnets are.    

I feel the wool is being pulled over people's eyes with the max or continuous wattage claims.  Are they talking about flying in a plane in the arctic or in the desert on a board?  If they would simply reveal the ingredients and gap that would allow people to really compare.

ive got two tacon motors I'll give to people for super cheap.  one needs to have the shaft pressed back in but otherwise is new, unused, and perfect.  the other one is stuck to a pulley with the set screw I loctited but i'll send you the board and mount with the motor attached and you can take it off...or leave it on and ride it.  It just sits there.  80$ for the mounted motor with mount, board, trucks, shaft pulley and i'll pay shipping.  the other one you can have for 30$ and i'll pay shipping

i dont know how many cars ran over it  . there was a whole crowd of people watching . it was a shamefull event .

after the green man traffic light is ON , people start crossing the road after all vehicles stopped .
....and i went picking up the pieces . all accounted for . few wires broken . and trucks bent .

space cell batt have a new look now after an engineering student soldered and pasted it up for $40 service .

trucks sent to metal workshop for straightening . still waiting for their call ..

they're reasonably priced . at least for me . in our local singapore online store and local hobby shops , a motor size of 4055 sells at $375 sg dollar , it is SMALLER than R~Spec 6374 but cost more . insane . totally unacceptable . i'd rather get me 100pcs of R~Spec 6374 than buy from these land sharks swimming at local malls . should say "maul" instead of mall !
ordering from hobbyking or other online stores ? true ! cheaper . but its far away from me , will take mostly 2 weeks to get item from u.s.a .
Australia is closer . hence faster shipping time (at least for me)
and if market fluctuates ? our dollar got higher than Aus ? better for me :sunglasses:

So my tacon 160 came in yesterday.  This thing is certainly bigger than the small rspec.  It doesn't seem possible to put two of these on a 180mm Paris truck.  Simply based on shear size, no testing, this thing should be pretty powerful!  The only bad thing is it comes with smaller bullet connectors.  Otherwise I would have tested it already.

From the looks of it, this thing would be a great single drive option!

Of course it's bigger than the r-spec. You're comparing a 6364 tacon to a 6355 r-spec. That's almost a whole centimeter. I want to do the same thing and use these on a dual rear drive, but I need to order 195mm trucks and compatible mounts. This thing is going to be a beast!

@Claudiofiore88 - You should checkout SurfRodz Hex TKP Trucks. They are a bit more but get the extended axle, black bushings.  177mm hanger and +70mm axles.

You get tons of extra space and they are a lot better than Paris Trucks IMO.

The trucks are nice and wide so you can pretty much lean as much as you want without the deck falling over so massive carving.

I'll have 6355 230KV and 6374 230KV around the end of March. Motors will be all black. Motors are sensored and will plug into our version of the VESC (just changed the hall sensor port to a standard RC port). The style of the motors will be different than the below option.

Thanks for the update. Next on the shopping list: dual VESQ with power switch option. Then batteries and BMS. Took my board out for a push ride the other night. First such ride in 30 some years. Only took about three minutes to find a crack in the pavement that stopped the board dead in its tracks and the shot backwards as I was launch into a fairly graceful tuck and roll. No safety equipment at my age = shear stupidity. Luckily I was unscathed aside from a bruised ego as my neighbor's witnessed the whole thing. I discovered that I had cranked the hanger nuts down so tight that I could get almost no lean meaning no control. Thought it would be like riding a bike. Hope the relearning curve is swift.

Inrunner motor torque question.
This is not related to skateboarding but you guy here are so knowledgeable this is where I come to learn Vesc and motor stuff for my water skateboard (jet surfboard) :slight_smile:

I am wondering how/if I can get more torque with less amps. I'm looking at two inrunner motors and brand with the same OD of 56mm, but one is 116mm long, the other is 122mm long. 

My question is would the longer motor provide more torque at a set RPM and use less current to turn it vs the smaller motor doing the same task? My thinking is the longer motor has more magnets, and will naturally have more torque for turning an impeller and use less amps at equivalent RPM, How wrong am I? :)

This is a bit of a late reply, lol.  But you need to increase your voltage.  P = I * V, where current is I and V is voltage, so if you increase your voltage you will get more power for the same current flow.  Further, if you are less concern about your power output and just want torque, you could simply decrease the KV of your motor, which would give you similar power, more torque, but a lower max RPM.  The length of the motor will not affect the power output directly, while larger motors may often yield more power, ultimately if you don't give it enough voltage, and current, you will not see this power, and physically large motors are not always more powerful, it all depends on the design of the motor.

EDIT: I am also curious about the cost and specs on this board, I have been interested in a water going board.  Are you using a hydrofoil?  Power hydrofoil boards seem absolutely awesome.

Sorry for my delay here as well, and thank you for the reply.
Yes we stepped up the volts and dropped the kv, about to do more measured testing, and we converted our efoil ([electric hydrofoil surfboard](https://www.diy-electric-hydrofoil.com/)) into the Jet surfboard option as our board works as both. Looking forward to some -1 and snow riding tomorrow for testing :)

Believe it or not, this tropical photo of me riding our efoil was only a month ago... now snow :frowning:

Newbie here  - I have a Liftboard single and the motor went out. Outer can rubbing the inner stator. What is the best and easiest replacement? What are the small red and black wires for?
a sensor? If the replacement motor has a multiple small wire lead do I just connect the red and blacks to the ones coming out of the speed control? Just looking to get it back on the road for my commute.
Thanks for your patience as I learn this.

(numerous edits, I kept seeing typos, there are probably still a ton, but i'll stop here)

@SennaF1 I would pull the can of the motor and have a look.  The can is most likely held on by a snap ring.  You should be able to pull the snap ring, and then with some force (because the magnets hold the can to the stator) be able to pull the can.  You could just have debris lodged in there.  If that is the case, easy fix, take out the debris.  

If you have a dent in the can, you can look at removing the dent or filing down the magnets or/and can, or getting a new can from the manufactures.  What I have done in the past is just taken the magnets out, filed down the inside of the can until the dent has been pushed back enough that the magnets can be replaced and not touch the stators.  You could also try and pull the dent out, but that would cost more in time and energy than the worth of the motor.  Honestly, if you just want it on the road I would try to file the inside of the can where the dent is down and if that doesn't work, just run it without those magnets, or file the magnets down.  Also, if it's not too bad, just ignore it, they will wear in.

As a side note: your magnets may be glued in in which case it would be a pain to get the glue to put them back ect, so something to consider, but if they are just held in by a retaining ring then by all means, it should be easy to pull the ring and magnets.

MORE EDIT: I would imagine the small wires are for speed sensors, the motor could also have temp sensors ect., I have no idea about the particular motor you are referencing.  **And just realized you were asking about a replacement, which I have no idea about.  You could contact the maker, or maybe someone else here will know.**

Took the motor apart. The can is held at the end by a through pin and a small set screw.
The can wobbles on the shaft so other than using an adhesive there is no way to secure it.

I would try contacting the manufacturer and see if they could hook you up with a new motor.  You could also measure the motor dimensions, and see what voltage the board is outputting.  This would give you a general idea of what size you needed, and you could gauge kv by voltage.  Then maybe you could find a replacement.  The problem is all of this stuff is made in China and companies are really careful to not reveal their suppliers.  Really, if the new motor you buy had the same sensor outputs as the old one, and was relatively similar kv and fit on the mount I think it would run.  I think you should really just ask Inboard though.  Who knows, maybe it is covered under warranty.  It really ought to be.  Just put the motor back together well.
