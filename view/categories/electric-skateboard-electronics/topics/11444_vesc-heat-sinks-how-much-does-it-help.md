Hello guys, in my current build i have serious problem with over heating due to my enclosure being completely sealed and almost no air inside, very tight.

My plans for the next build is milling a heat sink that clamps to booth sides of the FETs and has the fins exposed under the board direct in the air stream. I know that the epoxy side has a poor thermal conductivity, but i think it's better than no contact with the outside

So for the people who tried heat sinks on the fets, it at least helps to get up some hills?

Heat sinks will help but it will just delay the onset if you do not have a fan to remove the heat or some passive airflow. Is this a single drive? You can also reduce your gear ratio, and top speed :sob: , but it will reduce your current consumption while climbing.

That's the idea, the fins will be outside of the enclosure, and i will also lower the gear ratio a bit, currently i'm on 2,78, just waiting for the pulleys to try 3,0, and yes, single drive, no money right now to go dual, unfortunately

If you can expose the fins then you should have good results.

@SirDiff Those little fans don't really push air too well. If you want results from an induction fan setup you need to run something larger off a buck converter.

Might have to try this, I added a buck to power some 12v led strips but it runs hot too since 50v -> 12v. and it shares a box with my vesc....

this style fan moves more air and would work with a low profile...

After thinking of ways to cool my vesc would it work to use a pc liquid cpu cooling system for the top of the vesc and mount the back to an 1/8" peace of alumanum that's the top of my board, cause a have a corsair cpu cooler and I could replace it with a fan

Im sorry to burst your bubble, but the heat transfer from the mosfet to the outside package  is very low, adding heatsinks will probably reduce your temps in the range of 1-3 degrees tops.

I installed heatsinks on my mosfets and it made a substantial performance difference to me. As Chaka said, it only delays the onset, so heat eventually builds up. Wether it helps or not depends on how you ride. In my case, I have some longer hills followed by flats. Adding heatsinks enabled my board to barely make it up and everything cools off on the downhill. If the uphills were any longer, the heatsinks wouldn't be enough and I'd be pushing my way up those hills. 

Also note that different VESC's have different levels of performance.

That's why you need to use heat transfer plaster.  Sometimes you need to actually try things before spouting off. ;)

The key point is heatsinks wont lower temps unless you have some airflow. Without airflow you are simply adding more thermal mass which can help for burst currents ect..

I'm not spouting off, its simple science. As per the mosfet datasheet, the Thermal Resistance to the case (in this mosfet it would be the underside pad) is 0.4 C/W, now the Thermal Resistance to ambien (in this mosfet that would be the package) is 40 C/W.

Adding thermal plaster will not lower that 40 C/W thermal resistance.

This 0.4 C/W would not be from the silicon die from the metal of the underside? And this 40 C/W would be from the epoxi to air, if we replace the air with a cooper mass, this value would not be much lower?

What I am saying is you are using a myopic view by siting the data sheet alone without actual experimentation i.e. "actual" science.  It has already been well documented that adding heat sinks with thermal plaster adds significantly to heat reduction.

Heatsink = bigger surface to dissapate heat.
Plaster = better heat transfer between mosfet and the heatsink

You can also pack plaster into the void, bridging the gap between pcb and heat sink.

Thermal plaster is often used alone on smaller chips to provide better heat dissipation.

The problem is that the case epoxy doesn't have a high enough thermal conductivity to have a heatsink make a considerable difference. Lets see:

DYE --(40)--> EXPOXY --(0.3 aprox)--> (HEATSINK) ---> AIR

Now tell me, will the thermal resistance of the epoxy lower because there's a heatsink?

To give you a real world test point, I have heat sinks on all my Ollin VESCs (the high-output package VESC from Ollin is the only speed controller I use on my builds). I weigh 225 lbs and rip up hills with no overheating issues. VESCs are in large, but sealed, enclosures.

What are your settings? How many VESCs? There's a ton of things that will affect heating issues. I have no heating issues, and that's because i have conservative settings and good gearing ratio.

Its a great idea and it would work for sure! The problem is you now need a reservoir/pump/radiator ... and you have introduced the potential for flooding your enclosures if not careful ;-)
Ive also thought about it but on a board it isnt the best solution. Using the airflow already provided makes much more sense

Agreed, but i think it's the only way that it can be done, even if just delays the overheat, that's good enough, any other idea is appreciated

Things are starting to get very hot here, 41ยบ today, so that doesn't help, in the winter I think I never had this issue

Other thing that I think it's going to help is my new batterys, the ones I'm using sag a lot, and so the current demand goes up

[quote="chinzw, post:24, topic:11444, full:true"]

[/quote]

They use liquid and gas to transfer heat from one area to another.
Which is similar to how a "water" cooled pc component works.

Would it be worth using PC water cooling? probably not.
If you used a passive system (no pump) then ultimately you're just using the exact same method (less effective mind you) then heatpipes and it would be bulkier.
The only time I would suggest water cooling is if you want your vesc in a closed area sealed off but would like heat disapation. It would allow for you place a radiator outside the enclosure without risk to the rest of the components. However if you don't understand water cooling a PC I again would advise against doing it near 35-60V of batteries and a component like the VESC.
In all honesty and practacality your best bet would be a protruding heatsink from your enclosure or with a vent that has a 1U fan sitting over it in "pull" (ensure to get one with reasonable static pressure) position like the following fans:

I say, the heat sinks are an inexpensive add on so if they help at all, then they're worth having..
The problem with venting the enclosure is a lot of dust and dirt getting in.

That picture smurf posted shows 2 pipes which are closed at both ends so there is no 'flow' of the liquids/gas ...? The heat isnt actively being removed from the area, just given a path which it can travel down to dissipate? hmmm
I think the most sensible and simple option would be to have the heatsinks protruding from the enclosure but sealed everywhere else then

I haven't checked any data sheets, but I've done quite a bit of testing with a different VESC's when it comes to heatsinks. Same ride, settings, and setup under the same conditions with different VESC's and adding heatsinks upped my performance substantially. If I were to ballpark it, I'd say it was the equivalent of raising your max temp roughly 10C.

there is flow, the liquid gas evaporates and moves to the cooler zone and condenses. this moves the heat away from the heat source faster.

A heat pipe may make sense in a more massive setup, maybe a mountainboard, but when the vesc is so close of the outside I don't think is worth the trouble

@sebaszz Well I can see that your hearing is too high for a single drive with your weight. It really depends how fast you want to go. If you want to reach around 50 km/h top speed then you should go for a 14-36 gearing.  Because I saw that you were at 76% duty cycle when you reached 50 km/h. If you would go with a 14 teeth motor pulley your heat would get much better and also the acceleration.

Read @smudgeUK input about a simple air filter. I use an air intake with filter and an exhaust fan. My VESC seems to stay cool but I don't pull the amount of amps that a skateboard does. Designing my enclosure though, it seems like I needed to get air in and out since the enclosure would be completely sealed. Here is a couple of pics of my set up.

thank you for your fast reply. 

that's a good idea, doesn't this cause any issues with 12mm width belt? (less surface for grip)
I originally posted this because looking only at current, temperature start to rise already quickly around 25-30A. I expected with a rating 50A continuous this shouldn't be a problem. Maybe the mistake I make is that the graph only shows batt current?

## \#44 Posted by: Ackmaniac Posted at: 2017-01-03T11:46:53.039Z Reads: 208

```
The motor current is what rises the temperature. And according to Benjamnin Vedder the standard VESC can only handle 23A contentiously. Luckily we don't drive contentiously with the same amperage. And the VESC can handle peaks up to 200A. I have a 10S with 15/36 Gearing and get temperature problems as well. I attached already Heatsinks but didn't really connect them with the correct paste or a thermal pad. I hope that the temperature will get better after i done those steps. I am also looking forward to the VESC-X as they come with big Heatsinks. Need to make some tests. And you are right. With 14 teeth you would have less surface which results in less grip. Better would be to have a bigger Wheel Pulley if the wheels are big enough. But they are not so easily available.
The easiest way to avoid the Temperature problems is to have dual drive. Never had a overheat with my dual.
