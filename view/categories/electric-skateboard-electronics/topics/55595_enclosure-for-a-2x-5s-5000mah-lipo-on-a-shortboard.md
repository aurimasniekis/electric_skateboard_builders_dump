I'm thinking of going with a 2x 5S 5000mah Lipo for my shortboard build (~16" wheelbase). Anyone have a similar setup? Which enclosure did you go with?

Actually IKEA has this thing that's not a skateboard enclosure but it's PERFECT for a shortboard lipo build.  I don't know what it's even called

When I built my first board with 2x 5s Lipos I used a psychotiller flagship enclosure. The new flagship v2 might be a bit long though. He makes many sizes and can do custom for you as well. Very good quality abs enclosures.

Nice! Do you think 12” is enough for two 5S 5000mah Lipos, a dual ESC and BMS?

Besides the fact that I don't know what this thing is called, if you measure the lipos I will tell you if they fit.  I know where I got it from

you now post it under every topic where a enclosure is needed?
Don´t you just want to create your own threat and speak about your product?

I have a vac formed enclosure that might work for you. I have a mold for an enclosure with internal dimensions 1.5"x10"x5.5".

Those dimensions sound right. Is it used? How much are you looking to get for it?

Normally its $50 an enclosure, but since this one is smaller I can do $40.  Price includes US shipping.

I haven’t made a small enclosure yet, but I already have the mold made. You can see it in this thread.
