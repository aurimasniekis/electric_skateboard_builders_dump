Looks like we've got another V6 maker other than Flipsky.
Full transparency, here's the pricing they have.sent...assuming some of the BOM is replaced with cheaper components but they haven't provided an further pictures to confirm from a glance. 

120usd/pcs based on 1-4pcs 
10pcs110usd/pcs

Also this just an informative post for those wondering about price without having to reach out and wait a week. :)

Simply found on alibaba, I have an agent in China who spoke to them directly also to confirm pricing. :)

Always be mindful of quality though, BOM I'm pretty sure different, flipsky is great example of how it can be made with cheaper parts.... Waiting for list of BOM from them and more pictures of the pcb

Well it certainly looks nicer than flipsky's.  The case isn't way over sized, lol. Very interested to see how these perform.  4WD has always been just too expensive to build, mainly because of the ESC's, but this would really help!  Now if only gear drives weren't so expensive...  Once those are about the same cost as a good satellite setup a 4WD build wouldn't cost too much extra, aside from maybe more batteries, but those are getting better and cheaper too.

Also, I just remembered that the flipsky HW6 bulk price was like $124, so this could be very similar to theirs components wise.

I like how they call it “FRC vesc 6” so there is no doubt that it’s from another company but still easy to spot that it’s a vesc6. @trampa is prolly going to rip his hair out tho :smile:

Oh, freerchobby. Last I got a sample VESC from them, it was a dodgy bit of kit. I’ll wait for the sample units to be throughly beat on before I install it on any of my own boards.

I also have a similar expirence with the VESC 4.12’s. I wouldn’t put over $100 in these without knowing they can make it properly. This company is notorious for cutting corners

Agreed, get an ESCape if you can (I'm trying to), if not the FlipSky FSESC6.6 seems to be good quality for a about the same money ($184).

One good thing that came of Benjamin not releasing his design files (only schematic) is that companies have to  do some actual engineering!

Great Point! Definitely get an Escape if you can, totally solid. Now the, flipsky I think was in same trial and error phase as I would say this one seems to be, I mean now that it popped up. 
Not entirely 100 % convinced on those flipsky yet either.... Time will tell though . I have a feeling these and other v6 versions may be a little less needed when that unity focbox comes out. :) 
If the hype is real......

judged by the look of it , it's actually not bad,  but can it really do 13s though? also they wrote on the description that the model number is VESC 6 :joy: really ?:sweat_smile:

Flipsky has research and design team , both with almost 10years experience. Now they're ready to release dual ESC in one single PCB base on VESC6.6, They definitely don't do just copy job. And all the materials used are authentic, which has some comparision pictures in their official web.

I will say the right angle connectors are nice but pose a problem with two next to each other. If using CAN or UART you will have to leave a gap for wires.

Base on Vesc6, that's probably trademark infringement, not that the Chinese care. Although I suppose they're not calling it a VESC, but rather the "Base on Vesc6". Hey it's not blue and the design is clearly different despite the rounded corners, wires poking out, aluminum case and a lid...

I think the naming is great so there is no confusion. This bullshit we are seeing with the TM trying to hide vesc6 so trampa can take a premium is really bs....

On the one hand the TM tries to keep companies from directly copying their design 1 for 1 which would absolutely cause confusion. These copies (as with the 4.12) come in varying degrees of quality with some being great and others absolute garbage. Thus if one is directly copied they have to at least change the name and remove Trampa's logo.

And on the other hand they are being a bit heavy handed with it trying to stifle competition. I don't think that's their main intention but sometimes it comes off that way. Note that the TM just applies to naming the product, not anything else so anyone can absolutely say "Based on the VESC6 schematics" and all is well. We all know what a FOCBOX is.

Everyone that's been around for a while know what a focbox is but not new ppl.. That's why I like when they call something what it really is to not have the confusion there.

This vesc costs 60£ in materials (legit ones) when ordered in small quantities whitout the enclosure, hopefully they arent greedy and this wont turn out to be a crap vesc 120$ is a very competitive price :D

When I first started I knew I wanted a VESC. So I searched eBay for a "VESC" and bought one that seemed well priced. I assumed that since it said "VESC" it was exactly the same as any other. Too many people fall into that trap and end up spending more money. I got lucky with my Maytech "VESCs".

Calling the FRC ESC a VESC6 is disingenuous since it's *not* a VESC6. They cheap out (hopefully not this time) and you get a lower quality product that might not even work. It probably has missing features too. I have nothing against them saying it's based on and compatible with the VESC6, so you can still find it through Google/Bing/etc. We saw the same thing with version 4, too many copies all with exactly the same name. It was hard to tell which ones were actually good and a lot of newbies just buy the cheapest one since hey, it's a VESC right? The TM forced companies to come up with unique names for their products making it easier to tell which is which, but they can all still claim compatibility with VESC.

For all intents and purposes It *is* a VESC, maybe not a *good* one but that’s what it is and based on. 

What you wanted was a *Trampa VESC* and those are only available on the Trampa site, and yes yes I know,

But the same research that goes into picking a good working regular ESC is the same work that has to go into finding a good VESC: research. And not buying such a crucial part of electronics on EBay.

This is what you get with open source and this is what you have to accept. This thing , like all the other **implementations** (not copies) are the intended product and what you have to deal with. If this thing is using VESC6 files and hardware , then it is a VESC6. Fuck the trademark for a second. 

And while i may  be met with disgrunt with this: It’s up to the consumer to responsibly research and distinguish good from bad, especially in this field.

It is compatible with and based on the VESC, but not necessarily a VESC.

Yes and all those ESCs have unique names. They are all ESCs but they all have their own name. VESC is a name for a certain speed controller. It is the Vedder ESC.

Edit: I don't think there's a right answer here, both sides have good arguments and this will just keep going in a circle. Trampa is being shiesty but they have a point.

It's not all about HW btw. Most work is in the Software and clone software can't be called VESC. Same with Linux. If you want to put a Linux distribution out there, you need to give it a unique identifier/name. People need to be able to identify a certain source. 

TMs are all about source identification, so that you can be sure that you get your device/software/service from your source of choice which stands for a certain level of quality and trust.

Open source is predominantly about sharing knowledge so that people can learn from another and build upon each others achievements.
