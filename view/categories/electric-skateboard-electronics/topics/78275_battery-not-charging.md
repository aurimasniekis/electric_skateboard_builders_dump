Can anyone help me in figuring out my battery issue? My charger and all battery connections have polarity and read correct voltage. i charged it fine a few days ago. Now the green light on charging box  stays green, and my battery voltage is reading 33 volts but beeps saying its dead. Is this my BMS? ive spent the last two months building my board rode it a few times now having this issue. Please any help would be greatly appreciated.

Which battery you have? 6s, 10s,12s or something else?
Did you measure the voltage of each individual pack? They all have the same voltage?

Mines a 10 s and havenâ€™t checked individual.

Sounds like a dead BMS. I had similar symptoms recently and swapping the BMS solved it. Do you have someone you could borrow one to check?

No unfortunately not but I was thinking it was the bms.

yes you can bypass the bms, but itÂ´s highly recommended to first check the individual pack voltages to make sure no any of your packs got out of blance.

Ok thanks Iâ€™m new to electrical and just been learning and teaching myself. So any knowledge I can pick up is good and appreciate all the help.

there could be different reasons why your charger not charging.
your charger is broke, your bms is broke, or something wrong with some cells in your pack.
if something wrong with your cells, than the bms stop charging them up.
if the bms is faulty then your charger also canÂ´t charge the cells up and if the charger is broke...than nu... than your charger is broke :sweat_smile:
i would start meassure each of the 10 packs.
if one is out of the row than you need to change this pack most likely.
if all packs have the same voltage (by +-0.1V) than you can bypass your bms to check if the charger start charging your pack up. 
if thatÂ´s the case than itÂ´s definitly your bms and you need to swap the bms out.

Is your charger plugged into the wall?

You joke about this, but I have a charger that is broken -- it won't charge -- unless you plug it into the skateboard first, then plug the charger into the wall.

Before swapping bms and cells and whatnot, are you sure you get a good connection between charger and charge plug when plugging in the charger to your board?

Sometimes it's the simplest things...

thatÂ´s definitly a good point to check first!
we just had one guy here on the weekend where the charging port was boken and that was the reason why the charger didnÂ´t charged anymore.

Happened to me as I got a new charger that wouldn't turn red. Standard 2.1/5.5, but still had to push it in with some force to get it to start charging.

Iâ€™ve checked all connnections and theyâ€™re all good and tried plugging it into the board first then the wall that didnâ€™t work. Tried almost everything but checking the individual packs.

It looks like it wants to turn red when I plug it in for a split second but then just stays green.

And do I need to take the entire battery apart to know what type of bms? I know either way Iâ€™ll have to to put in the new one but donâ€™t want to do extra work if not needed.

plug in the charger (wall and charging port)
Than measure the voltage on the back site of the charging port. Do you measure some voltage there?

charging cable does not give any reading from the wall to the box. Can i rule out thagt my problem is the cord?

How your charger get green light if you canâ€™t measure any voltage?
Did you change to AC on your multimeter?

from where to where exactly? 

sounds like you are measuring the cable coming from the wall to your charger only which is probably not the case..

I'd measure directly on the connector coming from the charger first. Don't cause a short though  lol

If that's fine, next step is to plug it in to your board and as @Andy87 said, measure off the connectors on your charging port (inside of you enclosure) with your battery unplugged. 

Then, I'd replug the battery, unplug your charger, and CAREFULLY measure voltage on you charging port, but I'd do it with one probe on the charging port - and the other directly on your battery +, and then switch to one probe on batt - and other on your charging port +, to minimize the risk of shorting the battery having both probes around the charging port...

i can try doin that sounds a little sketchy for someone whos never done it but as long as probes dont come into contact i should be ok  right? And i was measurung dc volts thank you for the correction.

[/quote]

Don't do that, you ***will*** short your battery.  Cut a connector and plug it in, then measure on the wires.

no. even one probe can short your battery if you put it into your charging port. only measure off your port (backside) if you know what you are doing.

I said - I would.... - I don't recommend that unless he knows how to do it and what he's doing. 

I've measured off the charging port without a problem, but only with one probe

That's where your charger connection would go, so if the wire is no longer connected, you won't be able to charge through your port :grin:

Solder it back (probably a loose black wire coming from the charging port) and give me a "solution" lol

Those C- and P- are cold solder joints.  It either wasn't hot enough or no resin was used, or both
