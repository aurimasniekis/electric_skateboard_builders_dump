Hey guys - almost done with my build and want to know what chargers you are using for a 30q 11s3p setup?

I havent been able to find many with the correct voltage, are there any vendors or key words you use when searching for them?

Help appreciated.
Thanks

Search for that on AliExpress. They should have some with 2-4A as well

Do I need to match the voltage with the 11 X 3.6v of the 30q = 39.6v

Sorry for the noob questions but first battery built.

That‚Äôs for the shout @mikenyc

I have a couple high quality 11s 2a chargers if you want one. PM me

Why not charge at a decent rate.  3p with those at 4a possible.  10-12 amp.

It's best to keep it at 0.5c charge rate for lion hummie ü§£, for lipo you can do above 1c

Says who.  Not the manufacturers.  Manufacturers have a max charge rate. I believe it may help preserve the cells but not necessarily to charge so slowly. I‚Äôll look

Says the manufacturer

![Screenshot_20190411-112853|245x500](upload://pHYlhgSMUdCuV4K7qwlzE5q6Ofk.jpeg)

0.5c is standard charge rate anything above will degrade cell life faster

So for a 11s3p pack 4.5a is standard charge rate 

And 1c is standard charge rate for lipos, anything g above will degrade cell life faster

And 11x4.2 = 46.2V just some vendors write the nominal voltage and some the end voltage.
The charger I linked you can get with 1-5A depending on which model you choose. I think 4A is good for a 3p pack.

No it charges at 4a all the time, non adjustable

I just purchased some wate  10s 7a and 13s 10a chargers

purchased some water

Yes drink some water... the Charger i linked you can get in 1-5A version from this shop. Yes it‚Äôs a separate charge for each current.

But sorry I need to say that also this charger will not constantly charge with 4a üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Now it‚Äôs right üòâ Let‚Äôs don‚Äôt confuse the OP. 
A 4A charger is pretty decent for this pack. I think we all agree at this.

I can also recommend these Wate chargers from AliExpress. I have the 7A version for 12S and a 9S.
The output voltage can be tuned easily with the potentiometer inside so that you don't have to charge your cells to the max if you don't want to :+1:

The fan is a bit noisy though, like a hair dryer.

Is it possible to have an adjustable one? I also just built a 14s2p pack for my bike that Im building and would like to not have to buy two.

In that case you should have an adjustable lab power supply, which would be bulky.

Go for two of these Wate chargers. They are great for their value :)

```
the min charge rate is stated 1.5 amps not even 1c.  They give a graphing of charging at 4a.   


Charging or discharging ....everything slowly decreases capacity but it‚Äôs not bad to charge at the stated max charge rate in fact u can do much higher if u get away from cc/cv and charge fast at low soc.   Probably helps cells a bit slow charging but not worth sitting around for hours to me

Yes we have also an adjustable one üòÖ

A bit more bulky but if it‚Äôs anyhow only for home than you can‚Äôt make anything wrong with a lap power supply. Doesn‚Äôt matter which battery you will have in future, if you want to charge slowly or need a fast charge. It always comes in handy.

I disagree!!   U can charge it at 12amps if not possibly even more at low soc.  Don‚Äôt wait!  Ride now n charge in half n hour.  Too much eskate life sits watching the charger

OP, 4a is perfectly fine for a charger. You'll charge plenty fast.

I was sure about that üòÖ
I would say it‚Äôs not really a problem for the cells to be charged with 4A. But you might get a problem with your bms. It‚Äôs not always only the 80mA which goes over the balance wires. So you should know what you doing and choose the right bms. Plus idk how good balancing will take place if you charge up that fast.
```

## \#33 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2019-04-11T16:20:40.284Z Reads: 33

```
The bms balancing could be an issue if the cells are way out of balance as they typically discharge balance slowly. 

It seems yourebetter off charging at 4a and to only 4.1 then going to 4.2 at 1a
