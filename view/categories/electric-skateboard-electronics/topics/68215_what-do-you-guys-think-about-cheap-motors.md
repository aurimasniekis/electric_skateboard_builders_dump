Hey guys first I wanted to order these motors from gb (https://www.gearbest.com/motor/pp_009408166400.html?wid=1433363) now I found 170kv motors on ebay but they are really cheap do you guys think these motors are good? They even are sensored ;D  (https://www.ebay.de/itm/273441460893?ViewItem=&item=273441460893)

I personally have the eBay motor. I haven't used it yet as I haven't got all my component yet. Getting close :slight_smile: @rich is correct it only has 16awg wire :frowning_face: @Jasonkimberson has them and has found the epoxy is weak

So overall I wouldn't recommend it. Hoping it won't self-destruct on me.

Bought cheap motors, now I need to throw them away...besides the epoxy being weak, the wires are really thin.

I now ordered some janux motors, they cost me a total of 288
