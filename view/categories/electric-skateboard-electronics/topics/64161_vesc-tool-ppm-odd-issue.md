Hello esk8 brothers !

I got a problem with setting PPM in my VESC tool, 2x  Vesc 6.0 firmware 3.40.
Mapping done right but if I set Current no reverse with brake then motors will accelerate to 100% even on slight movement of remote and if I set Duty Cycle no Reverse it is not accelerating when moving a remote, but if I go to full brake on remote then motors starts to spin at 35% on center and i can normally accelerate and stop if i go to full brake, when go to center position motors spins to 34%. When pressing Write app configuration then they stops.

Any idea what it can be ?

P.S. I use Nano X remote
