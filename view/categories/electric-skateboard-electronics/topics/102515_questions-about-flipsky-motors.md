Im wondering if the FS motors (6384 or 6374 specifically) have 2 flat spots on the shaft. I want to put torque boards motor pulley cuz they have more options to choose from.

When i ask TB they said their motor pulleys have 2 flat spots to fit with their motors but FS responded to me recently and said their motor shaft do not have 2 flat spots. So that means they don't fit right?
