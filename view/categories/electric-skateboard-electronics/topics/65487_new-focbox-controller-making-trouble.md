Hi,
I have a new focbox from enertion and a torque hub motor 130KV. When starting the motor installation wizard (FOC Mode) and configuring the motor, I read those values:
R: 11000 MOhm
L: 5000 uH
Kp 5,800
Ki: 11000

when trying to calculate lambda I get the error "could not measure the flux linkage properly. Adjust the start parameters according to the help and try again".
I dont know how to adjust those perimeters, but the values from the resistance measurement seem WAY off for me. 
Can you guys give me some insight? Thanks in advance.
