Hi guys! I was looking for a new battery enclosure for my board when I found this: https://www.ubuy.com.se/en/catalog/product/view/id/10209596/s/diye-electric-skateboard-battery-electronics-enclosure-esc-b?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwZmGz7ig4QIVEaWaCh1E3wLeEAQYASABEgLhnfD_BwE. 

Has any one of you tested it out and know if it's any good?

Thanks :)
