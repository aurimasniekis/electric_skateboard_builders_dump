So I've been trying to get my project finalized and I've run into some problems.  See here:

 http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-build-enertion-dual-drive-vesc-member-built-mounts-space-cell/378/41?u=bigal

Now the VESCs will not turn on.  There is a red LED dimly lit on the bottom of one of the VESC.

I was getting close, I had gotten one of the motors to respond to the Nyko, the other was not responding and there was a bright red LED flashing underneath.  I was getting ready to reflash the firmware when all of a sudden everything just shut off.  Now its a dead stick, NOTHING!

Any help is appreciated

Thanks
Al...

Try the old version of BLDC tool. Let windows install the driver automatically..
