Use the search function, this has been discussed many times already. You will need a BMS.

So that is 2 batteries in series, with it being that you can attach the charging connector to either XT60 at the bottom of both side and flipping that switch?

Solder your balance and charge wires to a vga plug and mount it on the side of your enclosure. If you dont want to solder you can buy a premade kit from miami boards at a fairly reasonable price.

Here's a link to a post about my setup: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/full-community-build-6374-190kv-7s2p-9000mah-vesc/9093/16

The batteries don't come off the board, I just disconnect the power and balance cables from the board, and plug them into the charger.

The easiest, safe way to charge without a BMS or having to remove the battery(s)...
