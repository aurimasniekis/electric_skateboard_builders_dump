My Lipo battery pack is starting to wear down and puff a little. So I looked online for some other packs, specifically li-ion because of the higher energy density and longer re-charge life and found some on alibaba and banggood. Anyone test them out? If so, do they work? They seem too good to be true.

Meepo sells a good sanyo 20700 10s2p pack.
