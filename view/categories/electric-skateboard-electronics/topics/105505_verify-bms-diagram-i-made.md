Hello. I am wiring up a 12s BMS. Can not find any documentation of this particular model, and the seller's diagram stinks- it's ambiguous. I made a diagram of what I think it should be. Can anyone give a quick look over and verify? Much Thanks! ![12S%20BMS%20WIRING-01|500x500](upload://1yqNEwyarQaBJdwkOYZuND8ha5u.jpeg)

If your balance connector has 13 wires, first wire should go on battery main negative. You made second balance wire black (between first and second group), but there should be one wire before it.

Thick red wire should go from ESC + directly to battery main positive. You probably know that, it just looks like its connected on balance wire in your diagram.

Everything else looks good.
