Hello 

I'm in need of a replacement battery monitor and also on off switch.

Looking at the below if anyone can recommend either for the on off switch? Also if I want to extend the cable to it, which grade of cable do I need?

Or

Thanks

If your battery's BMS has an e-switch built in, you can use those switches, but otherwise you'll need to buy what's called an anti-spark switch (easy to find with a forum search).

These battery indicators are pretty common.. I like them:

The e-switch won't need much.. they're usually somewhere around 22 gauge or so, if I were to guess.

What style of switch you prefer is up to you ;)
