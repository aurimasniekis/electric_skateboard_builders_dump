has anyone used 6384 200kv aps motors? are they worth the extra weight over the 74?

Definitely interested to hear our thoughts once you try that beast out. I'm running a 6374 which is pretty torquey already!

Got myself two custom made APS 6384 in 170 KV. Bit hard to find pulleys with larger number of teeth and 10 mm bore, for example 18T and 15 mm wide. The shaft length, measured from the motor end face, is approximately 26 mm, just in case somebody is looking for the exact length.

that should be one hell of a torque board,is it for an offroad build?either sounds cool.
what ever pulley,flywheel,belt setup you use can you let me know as im gunna get the 200kv one..didnt know that 170kv was an option?how much did they cost each?

Nah, just a dual drive longboard, nothing special. I am building a custom truck with custom motor mounts such that I can swap between Abec 11 97mm and the Evolve AT wheels. 

Motor pulley (first trial) will be 16T, Wheel pulley for the Abec11 will be 36T and 66T for the ATs.
Don't remember the exact number but as far as I know it was something like AUD 320 including shipping.

Once everything is working I will change the motor pulley to 18T in order to increase the top speed.

Cheers

I am sorry but this will be a single build. These are semi-precision trucks which will be expensive and difficult to fabricate. Best solution would be to buy Torqueboards trucks and mount the motors in a diagonal arrangement.

You mean the standard sized Caliber II truck? Could fit in case your motor mount is long enough. Otherwise the rear motor may collide with the kingpin.

Hey man, thanks for the link.

I see those pulleys do not have keyway, arre you just using Loctite to mount them? Those small screws are not going to hold the torque of the 6384s

I'm using on 6355 motor with a flat faced shaft but no keyway. Also loctite. I can't say how it'll handle 6384 motor but on these it has no problem. The grub screws seems of good quality. I can tighten down pretty tight.

Dude the funny thing is... [and I respect you]... but are you really going to commute to work / daily driver on an E-MTB?  I am (4) builds into this esk8 addiction.  But I did start with ... oh yeah I want an E-MTB to go off-road then go into work with it...lol. I work in corporate nerdy people office job... there is no way I can take that to work... too distracting.  Then I realized that is too big. Then I went with an Urban Carver... still too big.  Now I am going with 29-32" boards like Jet Spud, Wasp, Earthwing because they can actually fit about 80% into my backpack.  

I did order (3) APS 6384S 170kV motors myself today with 8mm shaft.  One will be for my Jet Spud 29".  I think that motor will be a beast and a good commuter.

@Kug3lis let me guess... you have poor roads on the way to your commute? That is why I started big. These smaller wheels are cramping my style but for portability they rock.  We have the worst infrastructure / road quality for me to get to work from my party house.  Every sidewalk has a 5" inch gash and break in the pavement.  Want to move back to West Coast so bads ;)

Hehe I have no problem with work I been taking my Evolve carbon gt with AT tires for half year every day to work. I really tried to begin to like those plastic wheels but I don't really like all those bumps and shits and with AT tires you can ride everywhere every bumper pothole what ever it just works :D

P.S. I live in central london

Bruno does 6384 in 3 flavours of kv -
130/170/200kv

They are beasts

A keyway does not necessarily need a key but it's more effective as it can never loosen

To put it in perspective maybe shitty math but 130kv = 5.8Nm torque, in dual config = 11.6Nm.

My Apriila 1000 v-twin makes 107Nm and weighs over 200kg with 17" tires

Beast-mode, I may buy another to do that

Wont the torque be multiplied with your gearing too?

Lets say you have a 5nm motor, and a 1:3 gearing. Wont the final torque of the system be 15nm then, no?

Yes, but torque listed above is a 1:1 ratio. As far as I know motorcycle figures are done the same way.

Edit: You can't just multiply torque by gearing,can you?  For instance a 1Nm motor with 1:10 gearing could not produce 100Nm? Maybe I'm wrong :confused:

In that case it would be 10nm, and not 100 :wink: 1 multiplied by 10.

I’m afraid I don’t understand the keys. So I have 2 M3 grub screws that go into the 3mm key slot carved into the motor shaft? What does the key slot in the pulley do? 

Sorry, I’m new to electric long boarding :/

@chocol4te keyslot is meant to allow the motor shaft to turn with the pulley so it's not held on by bolts solely. Otherwise your motor pulley will rotate around the motor shaft. It's better to be able to use a keyway.

I am very new to this whole thing and am looking at these motors as well. Could someone help me out and tell me what the differences and under what conditions I should choose a higher kv vs a lower one? I know that higher means less torque. I ask because I am a 6'6" 290 pounds and am looking for a dude mover in an area with lots of hills. Thinking about doing a this on an AT style board as my first DYI and since I am new would like a smooth acceleration curve with the power.

Any information would be appreciated.

Rated to 80a. Assuming you gear it to the same top speed, torque is a function of max current only, so these should be identical torque vs sk3 6374 192 kv (assuming you believe the amperage ratings from hobby king).

At 12s, 80a, the sk3s dissipate about 4 percent of the electrical power as heat, so approx 96 percent efficient. Assuming the 6384 is slightly lower resistance, they would be more efficient than that, but by how much? There's not much room left. 

Don't think it's worth it frankly. At least not from a theoretical performance perspective. Bearing durability, wire durability, can balancing etc is a different story. Having never seen the aps in person, would not be able to say

Maybe it isn't worth the extra money but I wanted to have hall sensors and 170KV instead of 190KV. The motors were about AUD 120 more expensive than the SK3 6374.

Seen a number of posts recently with APS 6384 failures.
Magnet retainer ring breaking or getting loose.
Grub screw for the axis will loosen.

He's not the only one. Mainly dirt off-road through the forests around here.
No way a regular esk8 would survive.

Mines are still holding pretty good.

I had to disassemble them and use epoxy on the retainer rings though, afterwards their keep holding pretty good. 

Currently I'm testing the Torqueboards 6380  motors which are the same as the 6384s 200kv from APS but with 8mm axles instead of 10mm, they will power the @kaly direct drives

Don’t get the titel wrong I still wait 2x 6374 motors, so at the moment I run dual 6384 motors.
In the last posts you can read my opinion about the motors.

If you located in the us go for the torque board 6380 ones. The 8mm shaft is more compatible with other equipment.
