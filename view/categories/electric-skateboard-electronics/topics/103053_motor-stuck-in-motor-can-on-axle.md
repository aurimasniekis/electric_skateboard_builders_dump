I cannot separate the can from the motor any further, is there a bearing that could be stopping me?
When trying to pull the two components apart I am greeted by a heavy thud at the position in photo.

If you took the circlip from the outer shaft, it should came loose. It is sounds like loose magnets. You could mount the motor the other side of the motor mount and pull the can harder and easier. Check epoxy inside, if it is broken, you need to battle Harden them again....not big issue...
