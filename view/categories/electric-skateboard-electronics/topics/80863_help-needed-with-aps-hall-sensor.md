Hello,

I just got a new APS motor that got a connector I have never seen before! Normally there should be a male part? How is it called so I can order a cable to connect it to my focbox?

Or does someone know for sure what cable corresponds to what so I can solder it onto a more common connector?

Cables are from left to right
Black, yellow, blue, green, white, red

I want to ride that beast thanks for every help!

AFAIK all APS motors have male connectors which is great IMO.

You need a JST-ZH (1.5mm pitch) cable with female connector for the motor side, (you can measure the distance between the pins to get sure) and a JST-PH (2mm pitch) for connecting to Focbox/any vesc. 

Most cables to buy come with female connectors, the male connector is usually without cable and to solder a PIA. That's why it's much easier to deal with 2 cables with female connectors.

I think this is what you searching for
https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/esc/aps-sensored-motors-to-ev-esc-compatible-with-vesc-sensor-lead/

I just cut the plug and soldered a 2mm jst 6pin female plug with extension on. 
Donâ€™t like the 1.5mm plug at all.
Just add an extra place where the sensors can be disconnected or water can short the wires inbetween.
Before that I used as min liquid tape to cover all plug.
