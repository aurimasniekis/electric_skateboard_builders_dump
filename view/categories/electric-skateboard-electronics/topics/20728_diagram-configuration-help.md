Hi I couldn't find a diagram that I could understand properly or it didnt make sense.
Can someone tell me if the diagram below Will work?
Where balance leads and main leads goes.
And 2 of them in series to a 8s3p pack 
Best would be if someone could quickly write a diagram for my setup? Want Max 2 cells ontop 
Sorry for simple questions

this is just a scheme though and not a real diagram illustrating the wiring.
In real life you would just connect three cells together with a single nickel strip or wire and then connect them in series.

8s3p means you take 8 packs of 3 cells in series.
So simply start by putting 3 cells together with a layout you like. So all pluspoles together and all minuses.
You should have your 8 packs now.
After that put all 8 packs in series, so connect plus pole from pack 1 to minus pole from pack 2, plus pole from pack 2 to minus of pack 3 and so on.
Don´t connect first and last pack, otherwise you´ll short them.

also pls note, that, depending on your cells, you´ll get quite a bit voltage sag with a 8s3p pack.
Which cells are you going to use?

You can lay them out as you want. Like I said, pack them together as 3 cells, and then connect them in whatever layout you want in series
