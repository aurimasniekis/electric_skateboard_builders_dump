Hey all,

What kind of foam or packing material do you place inside of your enclosures to reduce materials being jostled and/or to maintain pressure against them? Cheers

Adhesive backed high density foam which does not turn into a firelighter when exposed to flame/heat

I believe velcro works better than anything else.  Either that or if the part doesn't need to be removed then double sided 1/8th inch foam tape.
