Hey There,

**Do you have a link?**  

This looks identical to what I am using - Except I bought mine from this guy:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vedder-anti-spark-switches-for-sale-from-18/31847

NOTE : His current model is down toward the bottom with three Mosfets, an LED button switch, and a larger Fuse.
