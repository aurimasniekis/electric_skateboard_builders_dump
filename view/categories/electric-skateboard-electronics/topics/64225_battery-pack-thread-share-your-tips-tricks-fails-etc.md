Can't find a thread like this anywhere so i'll start one.
Post all your battery pack designs, tips, mistakes, questions and everything else that is battery related. 

Hopefully this thread will help to prevent unnecessary fires and first time battery builders (also more experienced) from making common (or uncommon) mistakes.

I'll start: here is my parralel pack design. It prevents the parralel packs from rubbing against each other and shorting.

Maybe as idea people could also give a short information about there materials they used and why in which dimension.
Maybe even with a link where to get legit stuff.
I think here for example about nickel strips or fuse wires. If it goes to cell level fusing for example it could be helpful.

That's a pretty good idea. If you got fake fish paper (just normal paper) that could (most likely will) cause the battery pack to start a fire.

The same with nickel strips. I guess it will not fire up but start to get rusty. So if there is already tested once like from nkon, it would save some money for people who just want to order.

Just did some testing. I took some fish paper from Aliexpress and eu.nkon and tried litting it on fire. It took 16 seconds before the fish paper from Aliexpress got on fire and 41 seconds to lit the fish paper from eu.nkon on fire. My conclusion is that the fish paper from Aliexpress is fake. It also feels much more ruff than the fish paper from eu.nkon. If anyone disagree then please share your thoughts.

Hey all, new to the ESK8 scene and have run into a few hiccups when it comes to making my battery. I want to make my battery custom because its fun to learn about and I want to document the building process and possibly showcase the build / process.

The main problem is that I don't have a spot welder to make my battery pack as nice as I want it to be. This adds a large cost to my build, and would essentially force me to build a single-drive rather than a double. I thought I found a solution when I found Vruzend selling solder-less battery pack kits, but making a battery pack with those makes the battery pack very wide and will prevent me from using my enclosure of choice.

Batteries: https://www.18650batterystore.com/18650-p/samsung-25r-18650.htm
Enclosure: http://www.diyeboard.com/10s3p-lithiumion-battery-pack-esc-2-in-1-enclosure-p-628.html
Battery Pack will be 10s3p, making it as flat as possible.

Kind of split as to how I should go about this. Is the spot welder worth it? Should I find a different enclosure / pack configuration? Is making a custom battery adding too much extra hassle? Any info is appreciated.
```

Hey guys

Here is my contribution, it is one of those "[ask me how I know this](https://dosimplecarbon.com/how-not-do-battery-sticks-for-do-simple-carbon-frame/)"
If you want to squeeze your pack into tight places, make sure you measure twice :slight_smile:
And keep your wires routed neatly

Welcome :slight_smile:

First I would get some Samsung 30Q instead of the Samsung 25R. They got more capacity and I'm pretty sure they got less voltage sack. 

When it comes to the spot welder it depends on if you are going to build more than one battery. If you got a car battery or old microwave you can make it into a spot welder and save a lot of money. It's going to take some more time and you need to do a lot of research if you build the battery yourself.

https://buildkitboards.com/collections/batteries/products/10s3p-9000mah-30q-battery?variant=40527255109

I guess you live and the US and there is a lot of people selling esk8 parts. You could get a custom made enclosure but that will cost more than the one from DIYEBOARD.

Thanks for the reply! This helps a lot, especially with the enclosures. I think I'll pull the trigger on a spot welder to help in future projects. Two follow-up questions though:

Do 30Q's diminish top speed? Range is more important to me (aiming for 15 - 25 mi) but I'd like a board that goes over 15 mph minimum.

Also is this site (https://www.18650batterystore.com/Samsung-18650-p/samsung-30q.htm) the best place to get these batteries? These are the best price I could find them. 

PS: The Chi Battery link doesn't work. Maybe there website is down currently :confused:

Thanks again!

I don't think it diminishes the top speed. The voltage (10s or 12s) determines the speed. You will definitely have a higher top speed than 15 mph with 10s. You can use this site to see range and speed. http://calc.esk8.today. I don't know if you are able to get that range with dual motor but with single you should be able to.

You can get the batteries here for $4.5 when you order more than 24. https://www.imrbatteries.com/samsung-30q-18650-3000mah-15a-flat-top-battery/

Yea okay. When working with positives and negatives next to each other that can potentally short make sure to insulate one of the sides.

I've seen a few where the entire pack is wrapped thick with kapton tape instead of using heat shrink, that gives me concerns about heat. But also I think the 'heat proof' part is more about withstanding heat than preventing it from going through the tape

Good point. I've learnt that lesson. Now I stick a bit of fish paper on any cell blocks next to what I'm working on.
And I like to do the parallel side first, too sketchy when the series is done and you've got cells that close

I think we should be happy that it wasn't the 2 main leads. https://youtu.be/KUmlCH7bTO8 10:36 he was also really lucky. 

When you fold the battery do you just fold it or is there a secret trick?

[/quote]

there's a bit of trick. problems can occur if the fold is off-center because one cell blocks will be higher than the other. once the nickel has a kink its fairly impossible to move it.
so as you fold them open, leave them apart a little then push them firmly down against the table as you push them together

@TinnieSinker remember the battery pack could get off-center?  Well it happend. And you were 100% right. It's impossible to fix. It doesn't really matter to me since the battery fits without any problems.

For the spot welder part I had a total of 6 nickel strips crossing. 2 layers X 3 cells. 

It was quite hard to bend it when it was flat with the table so instead I lifted it and then folded. Should probably had kept it on the table and lift it up slowly while it was bending.

Save the center portion of your fish paper gaskets. They work great as a cell spacers for your P packs. ![20181104_130415|666x500](upload://v2W6xTIH3yYkVGdtnHzpL49m6dJ.jpeg) ![20181103_224546|666x500](upload://12CQMq8TtVpXSKGxfCwAGqs5OP6.jpeg) ![20181103_224553|375x500](upload://zSyFYdpfnCbLNSzd2oA7VvN8Ku9.jpeg) ![20181103_224544|666x500](upload://5sLCKvpaoOnhGRuHJ6ebnReefvm.jpeg) ![20181103_224549|666x500](upload://6dG8n6YfngK8W346TwTlzG5rC1z.jpeg)

I did my best with this external range extending battery to isolate all the P groups with multiple layers of masking/fiberglass/electrical tape. I re-used adhesive backed fish paper for some of the wires, and kept fish paper on all the positive leads. I sandwiched every wire with electrical tape. The pack works great, it's probably not up to the standards of everyone else here... But you guys think it's still safe? 

I used a bestech BMS with discharge bypassed, charge only. Charges great, discharges great, and I've got a low voltage alarm (that reads a little low, 0.3v low on average, I guess this is good) to monitor each of the P groups, and since I won't be using it if I'm not riding or next to it, I'll know when to pull the plug if a P group gets too low. All in all, the pack tests out to about 400wh, 6S6P. 

To seal it all up I did a wrap of electrical tape on all exposed parts, glued craft foam to make it as evenly shaped as possible and remove stress from around the BMS, charge, and discharge wires, and taped it all up tight with more fiber tape.

I've found that half of the cure for this (besides increasing battery ampere*hours) is learning how to ride in a way that maximizes range.  Just something I learned makes a huge difference that I didn't suspect as much

I took some fish paper from Aliexpress and eu.nkon and tried litting it on fire
[/quote]
Curious as to how you performed this test. Did you just take a lighter to it until it caught fire? 

Have you ever looked at a spec sheet for fish paper? Did you know that there are a lot of different types of fish paper and that most of them are not fire retardant? They are not meant to be fire retardant. Fish paper is used as a tough, wear resistant, non-conductive, protector for electrical applications. Most of them are rated up to 150C. Do you know the temperature of an open flame from a lighter? Some fish paper types are waterproof but most aren't. Very few are fire retardant but vast majority are not. 

All of this to say, that you have unrealistic expectations from fish paper. The reason it is used in battery making is to provide a excellent dielectric and wear resistance while being free of any conductive particles.

Kapton tape will work fine, it is electrically non-conductive but has good thermal properties, it can be used in wider temperature conditions than most other tapes and it is also a good thermal conductor (as far as tapes go)

The only issue is that kapton tape is not wear resistant and is easy to puncture. So if that's of any concern I would not use it there. Fishpaper would be more appropriate. 

I suggest you look up spec sheets for all these things. You will learn a lot.

When working on cells right next to another bank and there is a possibility of shorting, I use fridge magnet kind of mats on top of the exposed parts that I'm not working on. These stick to the cells and won't slide around, are electrically non conductive and you can move them and reuse them as many times you want.
