If i buy the TB mini remote, will the carbon fiber cover block the signal?

It may but you could always put the antenna outside of the deck. 

P.S. I sell the same remote for 50% of the price :wink:

Yep its the exact same, and can ship tomorrow! Most ESC's have the correct 3 pin PPM connector so you shouldn't need any extra connectors. 

*Still depends a bit on setup like dual VESC etc
