Hey guys,

Anyone have any experience with these 18650s? Not much info out there but it has an admirable bench test review.

No experience with that cell, but the site is very good and the cells' specs look quite nice

Edit:

after reading [this](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/lg-hd4-salmon-18650-bench-test-results-a-25a-2100mah-battery-in-between-hd2-and-hd2c.739018/), I'd probably go with the [30Q cell](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/samsung-30q-20a-3000mah-18650-bench-retest-results-a-great-20a-3000mah-battery.727190/) for the increased capacity...though they are a bit more expensive, so the HD4 may be worth it.
