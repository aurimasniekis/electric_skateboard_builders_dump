Anyone know any details about this vesc and why it cost $500 for a single motor?? No details on their site...

Looks to me like a V6 VESC in a fancy cover. I'm assuming that's just a placeholder price but who knows...

That looks like the layout for Vesc v6....

edit: dang, 2 seconds too slow. Agreed with @michaelcpg. Looks like a placeholder, but who knows

it's made from unobtanium after all!

hehehe

v6 is going to be awesome - paired w/ new VESC tool (vs old BLDC tool) - can't wait! (but won't be spending $378.54 for one)

@chaka...your thoughts on this vesc? Can it be.... insert bated breath... the long awaited v6?

Mr Vedder? Any information you'd like to share?

Definitely vesc 6 but almost $400 is ludicrous if you ask me.

i'm pretty sure it's a placeholder for v6.  It's definitely a v6 in a case (which Vedder has mentioned), but think the price is someone at Enertion having some fun w/ us.

If you look closely on V6 here http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1566#p1566 and on this new VESC, they are very different. For example STM and DRV are on the opposite side. I am not sure if this is good or bad. I think competition is good. On the other hand, Benjamin probably won't care too much about bugs that happen on this one.

It's not a v6. But I don't get why he'd go through all this work to redo a v4 when v6 is right around the corner... @onloop, we need answers, because we are too passionate about this industry to see something new and be forced to speculate!

The VESC 4.12's sold on Enertion's site have Benjamin Veddar's name on the PCB. Don't see the same credit being given here, these are branded with Enertion's logo. The lack of attribution makes me think he's not using V6, otherwise he'd be sidestepping the CC license.

So it could "just" be a rearranged VESC 4.12 with some beefier components? Is he allowed to call it a VESC when the design is not made by Vedder?

He is allowed to call it whatever he likes but he must opensource it. VESC is licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and it is clearly stated there:

If this is a different product not designed by Vedder he probably shouldn't call it VESC. Not because of the CC license but because of trademark infringement and because of issues related to consumer protection.

true - did not think about it much at that time. To me it sounded like a couple upgraded components (just like what chaka is doing with his VESCs) but not a major redesign like what onloop is showing with the VESC X. In fact should the other guy not publish his design as well?

This is absolutely not a new product as I am 99% sure it runs the same code and uses same CPU, DRV etc. This is most likely a rework => must adhere to CC BY-SA 4.0 => must publish the schematics with the same license. Swapping several components and rearranging them on the board does not make a new product.

Well, I must admit I have never seen them before, and after seeing them, I would not buy them.

But you are right, they should open source it.
But even if they don't, it would be hard to chase them on it. The only things we can really do about such ripoffs is encouraging the community to not buying them.

You're right, not a lot to do. Copyrights are especially difficult to enforce on hardware - so, violating CC license doesn't do much here except move the community against a vendor.

Sorry Man... But you just jump to conclusion too quick... Wait and see... Also, since there is so many thing that can go wrong (electronic wise) with the vedder design, that redesigning it, is maybe what will give VESC more stability and less stupid problem.

I think the major thing responsible for better FOC and no busted DRV is the change in layout. So this VESC-X might be more robust even without the other changes that are in VESC6.

Maybe the better components are just what chaka uses in his vesc but who know.
