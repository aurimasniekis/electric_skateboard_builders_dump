About to order another Flipsky Vesc and seeing if anyone has tried the new flipsky FSESC 6.6 duel PLUS yet. It's $280 and the old 6.6 dropped to $250. The only difference I see is it's smaller and has a can bus so you can run 4x4 with 2 vescs. I have used the old fsesc duel 6.6 and it was great.  Let me know your guys thoughts on it!

its supposedly pretty good. the first version had issues with the antispark, but they claim they fixed it and its all good now. thermal dissipation is supposed to be better as well, not that heat was an issue with teh first though.

Nice! Hope they work good. I like the fact that they are much smaller then the old version and also can go awd in the future if I choose to.

Dont bother with awd unless its small hub motors. Just get 2 monster sized motors and call it good. 4wd is way overkill

trust me, 2 motors (6374) at 95a each is more than enough. if you want more, go with 6880's, or 80xx motors like @Kug3lis and @Andy87 . both of them will tell you that they are ridiculously overpowered

My dream bms would be a version with 150 amps, 12s, monitoring of all cells with a balancing current of 500 mA, no drain at all, if it's powered off. Then bypassing the bms is not needed. Do you know, if a solution for this is already out there?

Buy the cost is ridiculous. The board weights alot more, efficiency is substantially worse yet you are not utilizing more torque, and its overkill

Find me one person who built a 4wd street board that wants it only for redundancy... alot of people build overdone boards for no reason, that doesnt mean it helps in any major way

I ride 4wd for many reasons. Redundancy is one of those reasons. I also can’t get the power and traction I need with 2wd. If I applied the same power to 2 wheels instead of 4, I would be slipping all over the place. I can still break traction on 78a soft wheels with 4wd on a full acceleration. So I do it for multiple reasons. But yea, range goes into the toilet and cost goes up. However, the latest build of mine only cost me 2k to build, and worst case, I have 20 miles or range and best case, over 50 miles. I have done over 30 miles on a single ride blasting it most of the time and I still made it with room to spare.

does hummie hubs v4 at 100A break traction? i know you have some experience with them

with my build its 13s10p, so weight is already in the toilet and with a 10p i think i can get decent range

I run 120 motor, 50 battery per motor. With 2wd, you can run higher power and not break traction since you can lean more one way or another and shift your weight so you get maximum traction. On 4wd, you have to stay in the center of gravity. Too much back and the front wheels slip. Too far forwards and the back wheels slip. Obviously, easy to overcome with traction control. But I don’t like software limiting power output.

For your question, if you lean to which side has the motors, you probably won’t break traction in your case.

It's about having a more consistent constant power delivery across your entire duty cycle range (throttle). You're not blasting 120amps into them at all times. The motors are still limited to 2500w~ max in that setup (assuming he runs 12S, 50v x 50 battery amps). 

I generally run 110/45 for the same reasons.

[/quote]

what i understand is that at the esc will use 110a at little duty cycle then at 100% duty cycle use  55a max?

so motor amps = low duty cycle amps max

batt amps = max duty cycle amps max
```

---
## \#33 Posted by: DerelictRobot Posted at: 2019-05-25T02:06:00.185Z Reads: 190

```
Almost. It gives a higher amperage ceiling at lower duty cycle so you can deliver more overall power at lower speeds as well as high. Too low on motor amps and your motors will be starved for power at lower duty cycle. At higher duty cycle you'll never reach anywhere close to max amps.

Battery amps are DC while motor amps are AC, so it's not apples to apples.

gotcha, I don't really need to limit my batt amps though as my 13s10p can put out 200a constant without an issue.

so im thinking of running

220/200 (cause of unity so everything is combined.)

```
We use thick wire which results in much higher amp limits than multi strand. There's also less interference. Down side: It is hard to wind... A lot harder, and that means more money.

When you do the math in motor wire (which has insulation), you can fit 15-25% more copper by doing the thicker wire in the hummie hub case than multistrand. The amp limits on thicker wire are exponential. Just a little thicker has a huge impact as you get thick.

They have moved to surface mount caps all mounted on the topside of the board. Its very compact now, and I'm excited to test it to see how it handles 100+ battery amps at 12S. Hopefully it doesn't overheat due to its smaller form factor.

Can anybody else with this esc check if they have the same input voltage fluctuations?  This isn't a problem with my battery! I have tested with lipos and it still has this!

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Hrbt-vNM984MgJ7pj8kwlz1rHPTvUHG/view?usp=drivesdk

It fluctuates ± ~0.7V without any load. 
I know flipsky moved to smaller smt caps, but it shouldn't affect so much?! 

If anybody thinks they have an idea what causes it and what is the root of this problem then please tell me!
 I can try to swap some components.

I have been testing it for a week. I will probably make a build thread soon.

My setup is:
•diy custom mtb deck with under side enclosure
•12s6p pack with diebiems
•dual maytech 6374
•this esc

It works and hasn't blown up yet. I limited it to 500w per motor because higher then that it reached 80c quite fast. I tested it up to 2kw total once, but it was too extreme for me.

The old Flipsky had voltage reading fluctuation too.  
Because its just voltage reading, it doesn't seem to impact the performance (minus the voltage cut off bit). 
In fact its called out on their product page
" **Reminder: Detected battery voltage**   **tolerance:**   **+/-0.6V**"
https://flipsky.net/collections/new-accessories/products/dual-fsesc6-6-plus-based-on-vesc6

The issue is consistent across their Vesc 6s.  One of the reason why I didn't buy another one and stuck out the wait for a unity.

@Randy_bobandy
I made it my self. Its a bamboo/glass fiber deck, coverd with that cool looking wood (I frogot what its called) 
I should make a build thread but I am too lazy to do that xD 
Also I had a tought that I should start selling these decks if there is interest. 

Finished build looks like this:

Also there is a 12s6p sanyo 18650GA battey back I built underneath the deck

It's probably a driver issue. I had issues connecting my first gen fsesc 6.6 to my windows pc. It would say "this device isn't recognizable". Never did figure it out since I ended up getting the offical Vesc app for android.  It cost $1.99 but is well worth it. It does everything I need to get my board up and running aswell as having real time date while you ride such as speed,battery life, amps being pulled, watts being used, watts per kilometer and to much to list. You need the bluetooth module to connect to your phone, it's cheap I think $10 on flipsky website if you don't already have it. I think you can get a bluetooth module locally that will work I just can't tell you where off the top of my head but many site sell them. Someone on the forum will tell you where to get it I'm sure, just make sure it's for the vesc 6 and not the vesc 4.2.

I don't have my new flipsky 6.6 plus up and running just yet, but the old 6.6 of mine aswell as my girlfriend duel 4.2 fsesc both have the voltage fluctuation. I don't think the actual voltage is fluctuating since when I use a multimeter it's stable, I think it just reads it funky.
