I was holding down the throttle key on my remote and once the motor started spinning, remote didn't connect anymore, so I found out that the DRV8302 chip was broken. I asked a local electrician to fix it and he said that he would repair the VESC for about 40-50€. I'm located in EU, Estonia and is there anyone in EU who is able to fix the VESC for not that steep of a price? (also I have no idea what caused it to burn/short)

Price seems fair for a local guy. Here in north america, our regional guy charges 40$ and you have to ship it to him in Canada.
