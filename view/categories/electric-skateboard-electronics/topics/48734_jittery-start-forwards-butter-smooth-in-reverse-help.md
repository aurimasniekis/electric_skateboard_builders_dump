Board was fully functional, no problems before. However, I wanted to improve the smoothness of the acceleration. 

Tweaked a few settings, most notably the motor max. It resulted in a very screwed, jittery start: https://youtu.be/Zu4W19qvIEM

But the reverse starts off so freaking smooth! Felt like a boosted board acceleration. 
I'm running 12s, with 190kv sensored 6355, focbox

I could solve my issues by going back to my old settings, but I really want to get this smooth reverse mode to work going forward.

EDIT: Startup boost is at 0.06

Was a problem with the motor, not the focbox setup. Had to flip two of the phase wires
