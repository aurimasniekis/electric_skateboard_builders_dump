I have 6368 280kv motor. It was going well but something got stuck in the motor so I had to disassemble it. After I assembled it back, motor started to vibrate vigorously at high rpm. I have realised that the motor part where it rotates is slightly off centre. As you can see, the gap is bigger on one side than the other. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/3/737495be6956db38e71a048b5ceca5f1804820eb.jpg" width="281" height="500">I'm pretty sure that this is the problem but I'm not sure how to fix it. I've tightened all the bolts but it's not doing much. Any suggestions?  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/2/42f18d9a0d67ba717a2c6cfac127af3fc024c378.jpg" width="281" height="500">

Looks like your shaft is bent. Just buy a new shaft and replace it.
