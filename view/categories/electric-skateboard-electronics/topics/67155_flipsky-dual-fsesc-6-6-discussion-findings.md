Hi guys!

I didn't see a dedicated discussion thread for the Flipsky Dual 6.6 beyond group buy threads, so I figured I'd start one. I just got mine in the mail today and will be taking pictures and testing it, so I'll be contributing my findings to this thread as well! I suppose I'll start with the pictures:

First impressions: Build quality seems to be pretty good, nothing is "obviously broken", packaging contained lots and lots of bubble wrap. The shrink wrap they put on the vesc itself is very sharp though :P 

I'm planning on putting it in a test build with raptor 2 hubs and a 10s4p and testing the shit out of it here in hilly SF. Hope I don't die!

Main thing I think everyone wants to see is 12S FOC performance. If it can do that then its a standout product

That's very true. Unfortunately though I don't have a 12s battery handy except for the one in my kaly. If anybody in norcal is willing to lend me a 12s4p or something, I'd be more than happy to test it as well!

That looks like a well built unit though.  This thread is a bookmark for me.

What kinda info you looking for? I have 6 R2 hubs sitting here at home. None work good at all. I've run through 10 of them in total. All the same results. They aren't good yet. They get hot. Bearings go bad. Ect... I get maybe 60 miles on each before they break down and need to be replaced. Not to mention the urethane formula is horrible (I have the new updated supposedly good formula too).

I live in SF so unfortunately it's not like the rest of the US where you can find places with garages easily... If I were to buy one of those places with a garage it will easily go above $1.1 million USD for a tiny tiny house... So I'm trying to find a condo with a separate bedroom so at least I can have a small work area outside where I sleep

You know the answer to this already Kugy. It's made from rock bottom, probably half fake parts, there's little to no QC/QA, they pay their staff enough to not perish at work from malnutrition, they don't need a marketing budget, they put super limited R&D into this and they buy in huge bulk from nearby suppliers. It's also probably a loss leader from a QA effort/bom cost perspective to make a name. Future models might actually get worse as they refine the process, get a reputation for being sort of ok and stop checking anything before shipping.

That's the world we live in. With all that said, I just purchased one, lets see how it goes.

I don’t understand why the dual is more than two single. 6.6s, but so far testing on the 6.6s is showing well it seems.  Maybe there’s a lot of cheap china copy circuitry board bits that are still good.

There's nothing personally negative in my post? It's conjunctively factual and I suppose that could come out sounding like I don't like what they are doing. I do like cheap esk8 electronics that appear to work, we all do! Hell I bought one of them.

There are however downsides to manufacturing that inexpensively, like wages, component quality, R&D avoidance, brand theft and many other things that are shady at best. These guys sent an email to @trampa offering to sell "vesc 6.6's" to them using Franks own website wording in the body of the email.

I want Chinese companies to innovate or at the very least charge a fraction more and chuck some money into branding themselves properly without stepping on other people's hard work/intellectual property. Do you think Benjamin is getting a cut of these Flipsky sales?

Oh right I get what you're saying. The Chinese companies should actually be innovating instead of just selling the same rebranded shit. Also was unaware of them being in contact with Trampa. The one thing that I do like about Flipsky is that they are at least showing there is a market for other ESCs besides just the base 4.12 and 6.6. Hopefully in the future they can actually innovate

Yes they did and are in the process of finalizing exactly what is required by the terms of the license. 
They are also having a meeting with Benjamin’s representatives to discuss the contributions as well. 
I would like to personally clearly some things. 
I’m Cory from hyper ion systems. 
I am the one who invited flipsky @BarbaraZ to the forum. 
Yes they are new to the esk8 portion of brushless motor  controls for this industry, but also have a lot of experience in the drone and RC car world. 
They approach me and other business that sold esk8 products when they first started making products geared for rsk8. 
We were excited to see what they could bring to the market With at a affordable price and still maintain quality. 

We also want to bring to attention that there is a communication barrier ( they are working on ) 
And I will chose my words carefully so not to offend. Some on the forum can be aggressive in their questioning and not to understand of some of the facts. 
They also have different practices and procedures than we do in the states or the uk. 
That should be taken into consideration as well. 
After I had a long night explaining evyto the Barbara and her team the have taken action on both the release of their changes to the OG design (not just copied). 

As you can suspect a misunderstanding in the terms is to blame and not being prepared to answer some of the individuals on the forum. 
They are work on that as well. 

I also want to address the misunderstanding that hyper ion systems had developed or designed a esc currently be made by flipsky. 
We simply like their willingness to listen and try to bring affordable choices to the market. 

To address the SAFETY factor that has been brought to the community’s attention in reference to low grade components being used. 
 
We believe in safety. 
We also know that nothing is 100% safe, no matter how high grade your components are. 
We do not simply resell escs. We test them rigorously. 
We want to know how it performs, how easy was the set up and it’s limits. 
We believe a more informed customer is a safer customer. 
We also believe that flipsky can bring products to the market that are safe and reliable. So far no one has “nailed it” right out the gate. 
The mini50 , single 6.6 and duel units will be a welcome choice for customers that.really have tight budgets ( high school and collage kids) 

As a reseller it my responsibility to inform the customer of the best fit with a esc, battery and motor. 
To promote personal protection like helmets and pads. Safe riding and understanding YOU OR YOUR ESC ARE NOT BULLETPROOF OR CAR PROOF........
Hyper ion systems will continue to advocate for these companies that try to fund a way to bring  affordable choices,  and quality to the industry. 
 
Thanks ,

Would be amazing but I don’t know if guys like ronin or SZ would try and get competitive. I recall ronins pro trucks are like $300+ and I recall still even complaining about SZ trucks which were alittle over half a set of ronins lol

You have any giant motors you could bench test with? Run focopenloop command in vesc tool terminal something like 80 amps 5k erpm? Some big 6374s might be sufficient. Thats the test we've been running with the unity to compare different revisions. Would be interesting to see how it compares thermally. I guess ultimatley you'd need to use matching motors and supply voltage for test to be completely comparable. 

[Sketchy old test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KYfsIuGevE) by @Blasto. New unity thermals are a bit better with full case installed.

I am also curious about the quality of components if you can just cut down 50$ of the price with a coupon which is basically 1/5 of the price so either you guys are selling into negative profits are your BOM is so cheap that this kind of discounts are nothing ;) I don't think they went into negative profits to sell it :)

[quote="Hummie, post:49, topic:67155"]

So after 1/5 slash off the price how much they will contribute? :D

If they’re able to sell a reliable product and also contribute even just a dollar for each sold they’ll get my respect.  Add a dollar to the price sure.  It’s still to be seen what they will do and what they’re even selling and after another month or two then let’s see

I really don't see why they wouldn't do these things. 
it's truly not worth an argument, and all your efforts to discredit them will end up only helping them produce a better product....

:joy:
I get what you are saying about all this btw.  I myself have blown, popped, destroyed practically every component we use and thats fine when its my bloody fault.  What I get pissed off about is products (expensive products) failing because of poor quality control and cheap components.  This weekend alone has seen the demise of 2 motors and a vesc(although the vesc was probably because of the motor) all of which are less than 3 months old and have almost no k's at all.  One had a bearing disintegrate because of loose can screws the other had the hall pcb come off which has destroyed the controller.  As I said no real use and yet failed because of poor assembly. This is on point because I have 2 identical motors going strong still after a year on my other board.  So make a product, sell a product and then once its established slowly up your profits by cutting down on quality control and componentry until the product bears no resemblance to the original.
 I sincerely hope that flipsky with their supposed feedback from testers address this sort of crap and deliver a product that has some sort of longevity and consistent reliability. Keep us all informed on its progress please.

I had a focbox pop a fet and destroy the PCB on first motor detect last week. There's always going to be exceptions and even with replacements there's always a cost in time and money.

I suppose that's just how it's going to be.

Just programmed it. Some notes in case anybody else goes through the same thing I did:

* If you're using a Windows based computer, even if you're on Windows 10, you will likely need STM's vcom driver. If you ask Flipsky, they'll tell you there's no other solution than to install some Chinese tool called "Driver Genius" in order to let it search for the right driver. The tool will find version 1.3.0. But you actually can just download the most updated version of the driver at STM's own website: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32102.html As of this writing the version should be 1.5.0 which is backwards compatible.

* The m-USB ports were slightly loose. At first when I plugged it in, Windows didn't recognize that there was a device plugged in. I had to sort of tension the plug in the port to get it to recognize. This was an issue on both m-USB ports. If you plug it in and your computer doesn't recognize a device has been plugged in, you might try this. 

* Running detection on FOC resulted in some random weird motor behavior once in a while. Of particular note, flux linkage testing will spin the motor the correct way, but actually running the motor, the motor will spin the wrong way. I've personally never seen this happen, but if it's common then I won't worry too much... 

Here's a video of me doing some victory throttling.

Flipsky actually did tell me the same thing, to restart while the vescs are on. I did that and all it did was Windows 10 complained it couldn't identify the device plugged in 😢After installing the driver I had to manually restart again as well. Then it worked. Very wacky

I am not hoping anyone to fail or etc I am just stating what I see. What I see is just copied the designs making them cheaper by substituting parts and etc. Sometimes even without knowing why they did it.

I would love if they made them based on original specs and make it same quality as ESCapes or etc, because I am bit tired of FocBox'es and would like to have ESCape quality esc available the on the same level as FlipSky ESC.

At the moment we are building several boards and I need ESC for them and I do not want to spend hundreds on VESC6 from Trampa like many of you. ESCape group buys takes some time and FocBox takes forever to get delivered. So if FlipSky on the same quality I would buy like 20 right now...

I am just trying to make them make a good quality product which wouldn't have issue or design tradeoffs for decreased price. My ESC will not be available without next year like for sure so I am now depending on market available items and at the moments its pretty scarce situation.

I’m seeing that they’re putting a lot of effort in making a decent product at a reasonable price. It is also normal that at the beginning to gain trust from customers they stick with a design that customers know.

I have the Flipsky 6.6 single unit and I got this schematic with it. The UART port is different for sure than the 4.12 VESC. Starting from the 5v you find first RX and then TX. In the 4.12 is in the other way round. So basically reverse the TX and RX cable. I think its there just to complicate the situation :rofl:

Yes you can just lift the pin at the level of the JST and switch between the two. Not need new soldering. I don't know why developer change also this small things. I don't think there is a real reason in changing the pin layout. Anyhow bluetooth should work with VESC6. Mostly of the problem with the clone HM10 is related to the firmware and Android compatibility. Thats why I flash mine with the original HM10 firmware.

Reports have been sent to flipsky on the cutting out on 12s set ups. 
It’s good to hear from the individuals we think these products are geared for. 
Taking into consideration that testing for specific applications are just not available. 
We are the testers. 
The advantages we have as a community is that we share information and help each other. 
Everybody wants top quality across the board. Who doesn’t. 
If your running a high drain, high performance set up go quality and top notch. 
Our point is and always will be is that the highest quality and top rated equipment isn’t a fit for beginners and  people on real budgets. 
We want everyone who wishes to have that felling of freedom and ( just cat describe it ) 
Exhilarating thing...........
We know these products have limits and need to be known. So any information given on this forum is valuable to keep people informed. 
One of our goals from the beginning is to INFORM THE CUSTOMER. 
Nothing has changed. I will give honest opinion on the best fit to each product.  
I have said it before, safety begins with the individual, PPE , then a understanding of what they are doing. And last but not least. YOU OR YOUR EQUIPMENT ARE NOT CAR PROOF. 
 The risk is inherent, it’s dangerous like any other sport, hobby that involves an individual riding a PMV. 
You can be injured on a bike or regular skateboard, so it increases with motors and speed. 
Ultimately , you need to be well informed on what you are doing ask questions as many as it takes. 
I answer questions daily and will always do so about all aspects of the industry. 
I will always help out. 
And I don’t believe in dumb questions.

Just an FYI regarding cutouts for flipskys.  Dual 4.20s are getting reports of cut outs at 12s when stressed. More details here are https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-flipsky-dual-esc-group-buy-its-on-130-including-usa-shipping/65517/98
I don't know any reports of cut outs with 6.6 at this point.  Folks been running 13s i believe through the single with no issues.

So I took it out for a true stress test, in the sense that I completely broke my ESC box and the vesc was just jumping around all over the place... But it's doing well so far, 0 faults!

Just got back from the test ride. The box I made completely fell apart and the ride quality with a cf deck and enertion hubs was terrible, but I managed to push these dual vescs quite a bit and can semi-confidently say that under stress and insanely intense physical bouncing around, they do just fine! Had to end up emergency taping everything together though...

![IMG_3636|666x500](upload://dnfFPP6PPtDMlKtxU8PLcn86nIy.jpeg)

For reference, it's a 10s4p with the following settings:
Motor max: 70
Motor min: -60
Batt max: 30
Batt min: -10

I plan on trying motor max 100, battery max 40 and battery min -12. I don't really care about this battery pack so I'll keep on pushing it if that works ok.

Last off the topic post. 

I was there for the demo and rode boards and people rode my Raptor 1 “Redux” which has all new internals. When the group ride started I went 6 feet and my board powered off. Bent down to check it out and noticed the physical on/off button had broken and stuck in the off position. 

Point is I had to kick the belt drive back to my car parked almost 2 miles away. Really wished I had a non belt board instead

Why so much aggression... @mtuan293 
All I see in @Kug3lis comments is a hint to Flipsky working correct to the rules of the vesc license and don’t cheap out on essential components. 
For what you need a cheap vesc if it get fucked up after 2 days because  the capacitors too small  to flatten the voltage spikes...just as example.
To pay twice for a cheap product will not make it cheaper... jmo...

About the original vesc6... read a bit more here about the backstory. There are different reasons why people don’t want to buy from this company anymore.

@Kug3lis contributed much more to this forum then Flipsky has. He is just on point, Flipsky is copying a open source piece of technology to get on a market on which they hope to make profit. @Kug3lis is a skater himself and tries to innovate and improve on existing technology because he is passionate about it!
There are actually two of the most expierienced  builders here on the forum who expierenced cut outs on one of Flipskys products. Its not the dual 6.6 about which is this thread here. 
Look at this guys thread, he went all in Flipsky. 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mini-beast-old-jed-jr-clone-caliber-ii-flipsky-10s3p-dual190kv/65827/26

I had this outcome too, not with Flipsky but with two different vendors from China, with this money spend on the false industry i would be able to build one of the highest performance boards you could imagine.
Don´t take it personal, but i felt some kind of negativity towards a valuable contributor of this forum.

To take a step back is always a good idea. 
You advocate for safety by way of top quality components and that those will keep you safe. 
In some part yes it can make a difference. 
You say your hard on these companies because you see malicious disregard for safety by way of bad  or underrated components.
Unless your involved in every aspect of desition making and production its only speculation. 
You clam we are advocating for flipsky becouse of money or increased sales. It’s just not true, I’ve sold 4. It’s just not a big moving item. 
So I’m not seeing the benifits. 
As much as you say you want to force companies to make better products. Force being the operative word. 
I would rather work with them and keep the customers informed. No one turns on a dine. 
Flipsky has shown interest in the feedback from this forum. Would a company that didn’t care seek this freedback. I think not. 
I invited them here and I’m starting to regret it. 
Congratulations on innovator of year,

Flipsky has shown interest in the feedback from this forum.
[/quote]

Showing interest is relatively easy and the cheapest way of appeasing customers. They should be measured by their actions. 

So far, certain component choices make it somewhat apparent they are trying to cut mass production cost whilst still delivering a functioning product. As to how that will impact the actual customer remains to be seen. So far, issues are reported with 12s (4.x hardware). 

Looking at "their" motors, I am left speechless really. Any respectable company would stop selling these immediately until certain things are resolved. Let's see how long those motors remain available without a recall, a public announcement of sorts or anything really indicating they are going to resolve these issues.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/any-reviews-or-insight-on-flipsky-motors/68080/38?u=telnoi

Short summary. Enamel coated windings are splattered with solder/potentially causes internal shorts (motor can smoke/brake unexpectedly /vesc could blow) and cheap glue or epoxy is used that melts beyond 50 degree celcius, which is an issue when you are running a high powered build or a mountain board/loose magnets.

It doesn’t look good but how does it show on the bldc tool?  If it shows to ride good you’d probably save yourself time n money adding more glue to the magnets n the windings and good to pin the phase leads down better also.  I didn’t read ur thread but are magnets coming loose? You don’t know what glue they use though right? Thanks for posting info on these new motors

But I won’t be buying those and the 6.6 is the topic and back to it.  How come no one has done an efficiency test of this esc compared to others?  I’m too busy or lazy but The data logging is so easy. I guess find if it breaks for starters.

I completely understand you're point and expect better as well. 
now was this just 1 or 2 motors or every one made?
first report of this occurrence?
there are a lot of questions surrounding that and we will never know exactly.
 I also think when I said showing interest it was an understatement.
they have taken feedback and made changes, this I do know.
Now how fast can they make these changes? I don't know. 
how far will they take it? I don't know 
One thing is obvious in order to be a contender on the budget build end they will have to clean up their production and refine the SOP and QC.
given enough time I think they can.
taking into consideration that the infancy of this industry will be just that a chance to learn, grow and do better next time.
SAFETY WILL ALWAYS BEGIN WITH THE INDIVIDUAL RIDER.
Every company I have ever worked for has tried to cut corners. it's nothing new, but still unless your sitting at that table we simply will never know how or why. just speculation 
I would ask that if you have a unit from them please contribute to the discussion or any discussion. 
I would ask that you give them time.
I would also ask that you understand they are from China and no matter how good google translate is meanings still get lost in translation. 
I would ask that you have patience when asking questions.
I think this forum benefits everyone the most when we realize that working together will make the industry safer, with more affordable choices and available to more people.

What about returning money or changing those motors to fixed ones? Not the idea next ones will be fixed so buy again.

Getting back on topic... I took delivery of 6.6 dual today and have it set up with lipos.

Settings as follows:
Motor: (80: -40)
Battery: (60: -25)

Batteries are running in 12s.

I was able to push motor up to 67 amps with the quick test run today.

Quick first impressions:
Pros:
I came from focboxes which capped at 60, having more power reserve feels great.
The unit is small and compact, makes setup easy.  Larger gauge wires everywhere inspires more confidence.

Cons:
The temperature sensor and the voltage sensors seems completely out of whacked.
Its not off, its hopping all over the place.  Anyone else have this issue?
Its a pretty big deal considering soft cutoffs are widely used.

Will attempt accelerate up hill this weekend and see if i can push the amp limits

Quick update.  I was able to get on the phone with @BarbaraZ.  
She was able to connect me to an engineer.

This is a known issue and they are currently investigating.
The deviation is around 1 volt, confirmed with my own logs.
The folks there believe this is a firmware software issue as they'd expect hardware inaccuracy to manifest as a static deviation and not a number that is bouncing all over the place.
I did let them know that 1 volt is quite a large deviating for the battery size we are using, they agree and promise to keep me in the loop as things progress

I'll probably check in a again in a week or so to see if there is any progression.  For now I am going to set my soft cutoff 1 volt above recommended.

Regarding my interaction with Flipsky:
I have only good things to say so far
They are responsive (knowing how to speak mandarin probably helps here)
The customer support there are friendly and honest 
 - I paid for the most expensive shipping only to have them reach out to tell me the free shipping I got is already the fastest tier and promptly refunded me the money.  This happened without me doing anything.

Other note:
I don't work with flipsky
I am not affiliated with them
I paid what everyone else paid for their dual 6.6
I only had the damn thing for one day but I do intend to beat the shit out of them.
I am relaying information don't shoot \ flog \ yell at the messenger
I consider myself a veteran builder having 2 diy (1 that has been rebuild at least 4 times now) and 2 other boards.

@BensonYong Is there any chance we could have some "official" responses regarding the fesc 4.20 cut outs under big load and motor issues reported in this thread?

On topic, after receiving my dual 6.6 and being very impressed with the construction of it I have now ordered a dual 4.20 as well. I'm going to be running the 4.20 on 10s5p 30Q's and dual 6355's - should have that operational next week and I'll blast it around and feed back.

This is a golden era of inexpensive ecs's :sunny:

Pushed it to 70 amps on the motors.

No fuss, it just went.  Remote was no were near maxed.
I did notice that the board was pulling one way during start \ stop.  Could just be me, a little hard to test.  Will do more during weekend.

Again rig is running on lipos (12s 9000 mah 40c) 360 amps, bottle necked by 100 amp switches x 2.

Quick update: Increased the settings as I said previously and i've gotten a list of hills to test the 6.6 to its limits:

**1.**  Bradford above Tompkins (41% grade)
**2.**  Romolo between Vallejo and Fresno (37.5% grade)
**3.**  Prentiss between Chapman and Powhattan (37% grade)
**4.**  Nevada above Chapman (35% grade)
**5.**  Baden above Mangels (34% grade) 
**6.**  Ripley between Peralta and Alabama (31.5% grade)
**7.**  24th between De Haro and Rhode Island (31.5% grade)
**8.**  Filbert between Hyde and Leavenworth (31.5% grade)
**9.**  22nd between Vicksburg and Church (31.5% grade)
**10.**  Broadway above Taylor (31% grade)

Will also do a sustained hillclimb test up twin peaks. Hopefully it (and me) doesn't die...

The 4.20 appear to work well on foc with 10s, if you push 12s on foc they suffer errors under "extreme" load. That's the collated reports so far. 10s and 12s appear to be ok on bdlc.

I'm going to run my 6.6 on 12s foc and 4.20 on 10s foc and I am not concerned at this point after reading other people's reports.

BTW its important to note, there are quite a few versions of FESC 
4.12, 
4.12 dual, 
6.6, 
6.6 dual.  

12s issues had been coming from 4.12 duals. 
6.6 duals which is what this thread is focusing on has no known issue except weird voltage readings which is annoying but you can work around.

Its also important to recognized that this is a new product and folks who have it right now are early adopters.
I don't think anyone has the 6.6 dual long enough yet to be able to comment on long term reliability.  
If you are risk adverse it may be better for you to pick up a more established product like focboxes or vesc 6 from trampa which also have their own pros and cons :slight_smile:

The 6.6 Dual continues to perform without a hitch.
This is with default firmware 12S lipos.

I managed to push 72 amps motor 35 amps battery.
Zero issues so far.

TBH.. the cost of electronics are so dirt cheap in china.  I won't be surprised if they are still making a healthy margin on it.  It could also be an aggressive market share grab move.  Spending a big chunk of my career in eCommerce its not uncommon for goods and services to be push at cost or even at lost if the strategy is market grab.  Who knows... but so far its been working, for me as a consumer thats what I care about.  And of course... as a fickle consumer who is affiliated to no brands... the moment it pops the forum will know about it :stuck_out_tongue:

Ya it'd be interesting on how they got their cost down.  

But at the end of the day, I'd like something that works and is affordable.  And so far it works.  I am also withholding recommending anyone from buying one.  Folks who ask what ESC to get, my respond had been, 
If you have risk tolerance give the 6.6 dual a try, thats what I have now.  
If you want something that works, get the focbox.  
If you are made of money get the 6 from trampa.  

It doesn't hurt to have a new player.  If the products bad I am sure the early adopters will root it out and they will be done in no time.  Otherwise competition will only make the product more affordable and accessible to everyone.

Probably my last "first impression" update (unless it fails on me in the near future)
Took the board out for a longer ride this weekend.
At this point I would consider the dual 6.6 "broken in"
Its been a solid performer so far and done everything I have asked it to do.
I had NOT be able to push its limit due to the lack of hills and the lack of courage on flat ground.
I have NOT pushed my remote to the max at any instances and I'd be more then happy with the power that it was able to push.

Here are some stats:

I constantly push my single 6.6 at 40 battery amps and 65ish motor amps (it never reaches the programmed 75A for some reason), The esc is enclosed in a 3d printed case, thus gets thermally throttled (at 85c) on longer hills, even if not so steep, unless you are prepared to go slow and not push full amps. I got a good 200 km- ish on the esc. I am happy so far.

Side note.. man, on the same motor/batttery amps my monster with 225mm tires accelerates like crap on 1:5 gearing compared to my colleagues longboard with1:2.5 gearing on 85mm urethane wheels (also his motor is higher quality, but same size). Its insane

The 6.6 singles were rated for 60 amps continuous while the dual were rated for 100 amps per motor continuous.
That might explain the amp cap you are experiencing.

I would bias towards the external.  Even if their switches are reliable I'd err towards being as modular as possible, so when things does break you can swap out individual components.

you are mixing battery amps and motor amps.

60A phase current is absolutely nothing spectacular, even 4.12 could push 100 in some cases

6.6 single is "rated" for 60A continous current from the battery. Which is BS I believe, but what ever.

I doubt it does 60A at battery level without any hard airflow or etc. I push max 50A (80A) limit with focbox using heatsink and good air flow it still manages to heat up to 40-50ºC depending on ambient temperature.

So, I think I did a pretty good test of the dual 6.6 this past weekend at the Evolve World Cup Wild Card race. Ran the shit out of it for four races and had no issues. I was running it on 10s in BLDC. 85 motor amps with 35 battery amps. Didn’t get above 104 degrees. I have it enclosed with no active cooling.

After setting up input, while victory throttling in the app, i could physically see my slave side spinning at  what looked to be 1.5 ~2x the speed of the master side, at least below 20k ERPM. I Ticked traction control and it immediately resolved this.

So, I just installed the dual 6.6 on my board. I run it on 70 -50 30 and -7. Before that I had the regular 4.12 from TB. First impression is very positve. The braking is a bit better than before and the acceleration especially at high speeds is much smoother. On my old Vesc there was always a sudden acceleration if I went faster than 35 km/h, but now it´s just one constant line. Let´s see how it will hold up over time. A bummer is the size of that thing (that´s what she said). I had to rearrange my enclosure to make it fit. 
Setting it up was also no problem.
Another thing which is irritating, which has been mentioned here, is that it cannot measure the voltage correctly. It jumps almost  2V. I have the ackmaniac app which is a good way to see that. I used a larger range for the cut-off, so it doesn´t turn off the board, when I have some juice left. I hope there are no other complications that come with that.

You can use 7 pins no problem. the only thing check the TX and RX position of your pin. I posted a bit above the difference between vesc 4.12 and 6 based. In the 6 they switched the RX and Tx in position. So basically in case you need it you only have to lift the little plastic clamp at the back of the jst and swap the rx and tx position.

Here the post https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/flipsky-dual-fsesc-6-6-discussion-findings/67155/118?u=rey8801. You can notice that the TX and RX is inverted. If you used your metr module on a 4.12 vesc and it worked, you have to change the position for sure. No soldering need it, just change the position of the pins.

Finally got mine installed. Going to test it this Saturday coming. Let's see how it goes. I am running 12S FOC.
That voltage thing is super annoying, I have sent them a message, still waiting for a reply.

There was people with driver issues, I haven't experienced that, I got Vesc tool 0.95, plugged it in one at the time to set up and worked straight away.

I'll share my thoughts Saturday night after the ride. So far looks good.

If the voltage fluctuates but we are only really concerned w the low voltage cut off...can’t we just adjust the lvc based on how much the voltage fluctuates?  If it wiggles between 45 and 43v and I want it set to 43 I could just set to 44 no?

Alright guys, just got home from the ride.
First of all my setup so we can "compare notes" in the future.
2X 6364 192KV Motors
Gear Ratio: 15/66
Wheels: 200mm on Superstar Hubs.
10A Battery pack 12S2P
Cheap 2.4ghz Remote Control from amazon.

Conservative settings for this test ride:
50A
-25
50A
-25
FOC

https://metr.at/r/WjCE9  (24KMs Total)

Thoughts:
Compared to the crappy 4.12 ESCs from HB the FSESC runs much better, no weird drops in voltage, no weird errors on metr no random issues where it breaks for no reason overall much better experience.
It was my first time riding on FOC and I kinda like it, I love the torque on the BLDC mode but the FOC gives me more confidence on the road hence it has better start from stand still.

Anyone having the issue where metr does not record the speed and/or distance?

Regarding the voltage fluctuation thing, like you guys I just dropped the cutoff by 1v and no issues so far.
So far I am happy with it, but to be 100% honest it is way to early to tell. I'll keep you guys updated if something happens.

Best Regards
Nesquick

True. I am assuming it is just bad design. I hope not, but that's what it seems like.

One thing that I forgot to mention on the post above, before you get the ESC if you ask something on the facebook page you get an almost instant reply. Once you say "I got the thing" and if you ask something, they will not reply. That's super shitty and yes I understand that they must have tons of messages, the thing is the more transparent you run your business the less questions people throw at you, it is way better for everyone  to get a "We don't know what the issue is!" than complete silence.

On the other hand we are the early adopters so we knew the risks, so I am not complaining I am just reporting my experience so far.

Resume:
Support before buying: Great
Support after buying: Super bad (They do not reply)
Product itself: Apart from the voltage problem, seems good so far, I am happy with it,

Best Regards

The typical game.
Deny it is a hardware issue. This problem has been known almost since the very beginning. To continue selling the product, they told subsequent buyers that the issue is firmware related. People keep rediscovering the voltage problem., which renews the discussion over and over again. 

Now they try to offer those who openly complain a solution to stop the current wave of complaints. They know full well that their current lineup has issues.

Most likely affects the cals. Now the real question is, does it matter?
This is a screenshot of my old ESC:
https://prnt.sc/l9t0ck
https://prnt.sc/l9t060

This is the new FSESC:
https://prnt.sc/l9t0hd
https://prnt.sc/l9t0m8

Same exact run, same exact settings. The reason why on the first set of screenshots it says 138 minutes and on the second set 109 it is just because one run was on a Sunday = Loads of people on the path (People stopping me to ask about the board, etc etc), and the other one was last Saturday after 5pm which has way less people on the path.
As you can see the stats are pretty much the same (Temperatures on the FSESC are better, but that difference is related to the weather itself, it was a colder day). So unless you are doing something that needs to be super precise i would say it does not matter.

Best Regards
Nesquick

What is closer than 2x duals for a 4wd build?! I mean you use a dual for space efficiency and saving connections. So 2x duals are perfect...

Funny thing is: the 4.20 has a dedicated CAN-Port and the internal Can switch. So you can easily do a 4WD with 2x 4.20 FS...still 4.20 sucks on FOC @12s

You can't find one because there isn't one :smiley: 
Your post got me thinking, so I went down the rabbit hole to try to find a solution :smiley:
SPOILER ALERT: After thinking about it, some research and some words with Flipsky themselves to confirm my theories I think its possible if you don't mind to "void warranty" and solder some wires into your Dual 6.6. 

DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THIS MAY CAUSE TO YOUR ESCs, this is purely based on my knowledge of Electronics and the words I exchanged with Flipsky.
With that out of the way, let's talk about it :smiley:

So I was thinking about what you asked and the reality is, the Dual 6.6 is 2X ESCs glued together with an interface connecting both (CAN BUS), it got me thinking, where is that interface then? The answer is really simple, it is right in the middle of the board, the switch that we change position to make the board switch between SINGLE/DUAL it is just a "cut" for the CAN BUS.

I checked which pins on the switch were "transmitting" information and found out those are the 2 bottom pins.
SOOOOOOO, in theory if you solder those 2 bottom pins from the Dual 6.6 to another one it should effectively pass the information along.

I then threw the idea to Flipsky themselves hoping for a confirmation of some sort that that would possibly work and voila, they confirmed that those 2 bottom pins are indeed the DATA for the CAN bus.

Now, this is just me playing around with my own Dual 6.6 and this hasn't been tested obviously, I don't have 2 to test but if you want to send me one so I can try it drop me a DM :smiley: :smiley: (JK JK) or give me some time so I can maybe hook up an micro controller and test it that way. :smiley:

Once again, this hasn't been fully tested by me, at least YET, and I am not responsible for any damage you may cause to your ESCs.

Hope this information helps.
Best Regards

So is the voltage fluctuation really a problem for anyone? I didn't get my BT mod installed before parking my board for the winter, My anti-spark blew, switched to loop key and didn't want to mess with it anymore, just ride. .5 volts to 1 volt is what im reading on here, that just affects the cutoffs, currect? So theoretically it only affects range and battery safety at low levels?

Honestly for me it only floats +-0.3v.  it doesn't hurt charging. And if you are not setting your min cell voltage to 2.5v per cell it does matter much. I have it set to 3v min so it can go as low as 2.7v and I rarely hit low battery with my 13s4p pack 30+ miles range

On 12s it gives me an error of about 1-2V so like 0.2V max per cell. I just set the cut of a bit lower and never drain the battery. For the rest is fine. Only difference compare my 4.12 set up is the regenerative braking that I needed to set higher in order to have decent brake.

Forgot to post my experience with the FSESC 6.6 dual and Flipsky after sales service here. One half of my VESC started to blink red out of nowhere and then decided to give up (this was during motor setup). I didn't smell anything burn or hear anything pop. Flipsky, after a short email correspondence where they suggested reflashing firmware, asked me to send it back for repair and sent a replacement 6.6 dual.

to be totally honest, I could have been a few mph off, as it was measured on my note 8 (with no cellular but wifi GPS )

But it was the hubs with a space cell pro 4 40a batt max each motor and 95mm wheels

All i remember was the normal sound of the hubs... and then it went BALLISTIC and I started to gain speed very quickly :D (sort of like when the motor reaches that little slice of RPM where its most efficient in power delivery, but more agressive)

I ran out of room on the road (they started to become windy with not alot of headroom for seeing cars :) )

My 6.6 dual is running well apart from the poor voltage reading stability. I’d happily buy another if they sorted it.

I followed up with Barbara about the voltage.  She said its still being tested and didn't give me more info.  my 6.6 been treating me well so far (knock on wood) would def pick up another if they fix the voltage issue

Ok, first DIY Build in progress... 

So I've got Flipsky Dual 6.6 powered up, connected to the VESC tool, set up the motor, set up the input to Dual VESC Master...

Connect to other USB port, set up the motor, set up the input as Slave VESC.

Now when I use remote, only the one motor (MASTER) is listening... Both motors have passed setup from VESC Tool without issue, but I cannot get to control the other motor, only one is listnening... 

What could be an issue, I have tried with dual CAN Switch ON and OFF on the ESC..

Only one of the green LEDs is blinking while operating the remote.

Thanks in advance

EDIT, I am using FireFly remote

EDIT2 - REFLASHED firmware --- All Good NOW

So did anyone get a regular HM-10 Bluetooth module to work with these? I see people got the Metr one working. I have the module plugged in correctly, using 5v, tx>rx and rx>tx. I chose PPM and UART as well as dropped the baud rate to 9600. The BT module powers on and I get the flashing red light but it doesn't show up in the VESC tool and I can't seem to connect to it with my phone even though it sees it. Is there something else I could be missing?

That's how it was originally wired. But, I will try that again as I don't think I messed with the baud rate when it was. All the posts I've read, including this one, said they should be tx>rx and rx>tx so I just assumed that was my issue. I'll report back when I try it.

I've read about the Android issue as well. I have a Pixel 2 which has ver. 9 on it but thought that issue was fixed. Also, shouldn't it still show up in the VESC software? That has nothing to do with my ver. of Android as it's plugged in via USB, right? When I try and connect with my phone it asks for a PW but will not allow me any further. I Googled the PW and have tried every length all the way up to 1234567890. I was able to successfully pair it once and that's it. I didn't get any data from it at that point either. I also have a legit (to the best of my knowledge) HM-10 module as I got it from @psychotiller when I bought my battery and enclosure. It's the McCloed's BT listed on his site if that helps.

I had a hm-10 connected with no issue. Just got a lot of small files cus the signal was intermittent. Have you enable UART on you VESC 9600 baud rate yet? I'm using a vivo Nex which is a custom Android 9 I believe.

I thought it only show up on VESC-Tool when you enable TCP bridge using the app.

I just noticed on the Flipsky site that they do show tx>tx and rx>rx. They also say that the FSESC UART port only works at 115200 baud. I'm guessing the BT module I have just isn't compatible.

I got a Flipsky Dual 6.6 and it is working with fake HM-10 and Ackmaniac App and with Metr.pro module. 
Just had to change my plug, since Flipsky Uart connector has rx tx switched. All other VESCs have it in other order. But if I connect rx-tx and tx-rx like labled on fake HM-10 and FSESC it works with 9600Baud, didnt try anything else yet. I am using android 6 on LG V10. 
Also didnt try the nrf51 module, might be different.

Since HM-10 is BLE module, you dont connect directly, the App connects. So you dont have a real "paring" of your phone and the BT module.

I've even gone so far as to try every supported baud rate. It simply doesn't work. The other thing I noticed is that the BT module shows up as MLT-BT05, is that correct? Does that mean mine is a knock off?

swap the rx/tx and try it again. I know you said you wired it up correct, but who knows ;) 
I once hat similar problem with the single 6.6
Maybe I´m totally wrong, or the Flipsky drawings are wrong.
Either way it´s easy and fast done to swap the two wires.

If the red led blinks, it's broadcasting. If it's solid, it's connected. Rt and tx are supposed to be crossed.  If it doesn't work, try reflashing FW. Or switch to the other side of the dual.

Runs perfect as a single.  Motor detection works on both sides but they wont talk to each other.  Since theres no way to plug in a receiver to the slave side, I am kind of stuck here.  Waiting for flipsky to get back to me.  (and yes I tried flipping the single / dual switch)

Hi, 
Im new here and I'm just building a "eKickboard" out of an old frame. I have to make a choise between few ESCs but ever since I have red this thread (not fully) I wonder if Flipsky is still a choise for me. Im running 12s4p and motor will be 350W. Seems to be that there are issues with this setup + Flipsky.

Few words about Flipsky and Chinese way of making things. Even though I buy lot of things from China mainly HW related parts but what comes to quality and money investment, it is not the best place to "gamble". This fits particulary well for ESC which is the essential and also sensitive part of the setup. There are two things that bothers me, their choise of components and their pricing. They sell "VESCs" around 85$ and many people wonder why they can sell so cheap when original VESCs sell for +200$. The most expensive parts are PCB, MCU, MOSFETs and DRVxx chip, the rest is resistors, connectors, capacitors etc. I estimated the BOM to be around 40$ and these parts are from Mouser.com(!) using genuine parts. Flipsky is still making around 100% profit out of it if only BOM is concerned. Manufacturing costs and development costs are minor detail in China. The 2nd thing is their quality in overall. There are numerous possibilities how you can go under the western standards, first comes to my mind their working spaces, manufacturing tolerances, solder process, component selection, ESD control, quality checks and handling issues etc. Electronic production these days is more than just placing components to a board.

What bothers me as well is why VESC put their price tag into a whopping 200+£ !!! This is extremely overpriced and it comes with the aluminium housing which typical DIY hobbyinst do not need.
If the BOM is still around 40$ for VESC they make ridicilous profit of +700% making the ESC the most expensive part of your setup. That's one reason why FlipSky opened a new market with copied VESCs.

There was one guy @stewii who made some vesc6 clones in pretty good quality...
 https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/escape-professional-pcb-assembly/49720?u=andy87

If I remember right the price of all parts from the BOM where around 80$ or £ (don’t nail me on it...)
plus the heat sink case 35£ round about.
I wouldn’t say that people in diy don’t use this case.
If I look at the dual case which came with the ESCapes it’s exactly what I was needing for my build...

Don’t ask why trampa sold the vesc6 for over 300$ and still sell them for over 200$... some would say it’s the German high quality silicon wire which makes it worth...other just 💁‍♂️... 😅
But to be fair so far I never heard of any big issue with a trampa vesc6 so... 
everybody is free to buy what he want and every vendor is free to sell his products for the price he want.

You can find several similar designs from TI where they have open HW and BOM list.
ESCape design isn't proven, that design uses 63Volt Electrolytic caps in a 60V rated design... brrrrrr.
Design also uses exclusive automotive FETs which is not necessary, with similar specs you can find many alternatives in half the price saving a lot when you have 6 of them. Hard to believe you can spend 80+$ on such simple layout unless you have chosen overrated parts for the usage they go in.

After discontinuing of the focbox there is still a need for good relatable single vescs.
Just imagine how much money you could make with it... if you say the parts are only 40£ and you sell them for 80-100£ than that should be an easy thing for you, no?

Why should I produce another VESC copy and try to sell it with the same price what Chinese do today ??
I dont see any point or any market on that. All I say is that original VESCs 300+$ price tag is ridicilous wallet rip off and doesn't have any 200$$ worth extra magic in it.

Because Flipsky 6.6 isn’t as reliable as the original vesc6. Also performace is worth.
The cheapest version is still 155$ which is way more than you could sell them...so there are a lot of good reasons to do so.

Chinese should get back their dignity of making at least decent copies if not totally their own product.
For me personally, I dont see there a big market to make such effort to make a decent copy, it requires time and investment to even get to a starting point and chances to get anywhere further than that still exist. I have aswell my own issues of using someones HW design and software as a base for my own business. 
btw, Vanda Electronics claim (at least) their manufacturing quality is better in Taiwan than their Chinese competitors(!?), Who knows. At least their price is bit more decent than original VESC and slightly more than FlipSky. Any news on their product how it performs?

I never owned a vanda vesc but you can’t compair hw4.12 with hw6 it’s a pretty big difference.
I also doubt that a hw4.12 vesc without heat sink can handle 50A continues as they claim on there website... with this said i wouldn’t trust this more than a Flipsky 4.12 vesc.

I guess VESC 6was made since TI announced new DRV chip generation with 3 current amps built in. Back in the day they only had 2. So I can imagine VESC6 is better performing, or at least more accurate in terms of measuring the motor currents. I dont know if the previous generation is bad, but the new generation is just slightly better.

Let’s don’t speak about the change from 2 to 3 shunt design I would say a increase from 35A to 60 (80) A constant, no CAN bus disconnect issues, reliable FOC even with 12s and an erpm limit rise from 60000 to 140000 is quite a big difference for me personally.
But other people can see that different.

Yeah, depends ofcourse how to use it. Not all need the extremes and pay extra for things they do not require. Personally for me I need 12s FOC but moderate 20(ish)A currents. I don't want to pay extra for fancy MOSFETs or thick superduper oxyge free copper silicon wires and black polished aluminium heatsink -casing.

![P_20190317_093834|690x388](upload://mQzSjueFDX7FjSX8nHtGUqh1dQg.jpeg) 

Despite some reviews about the dual esc 6.6 malfunctions I wanted to give it a chance, also for the price / quality ratio.
My eboard has two turnigy 6374 149KV motors (sensored), gear ratio 15/72, 10s 16A Turnigy Graphene battery.

For me it works very well, quiet, big torque, it never heats up and maximizes the use of the battery.

I would like advice from the forum experts regarding the configuration of the VESC.
This is my parameters, I am using sensored FOC :

- Motor current max               80
- Motor current max brake    -40
- Absolute max current         130A
- Battery current max            60
- Battery current maxregen  -16

Many thanks to anyone who wants to give an advice ...

Hello, everyone, looking for some help today.
I've had the Flipsky Dual 6.6 for about 5 months, it's been working perfect except suddenly not working when I tried to turn it on yesterday. I opened the enclosure and saw that both blue lights are on, but only one green light is on, the master vesc has no green light showing. I can't connect to the master vesc in the VESC tool. Anyone have any suggestions as to how I can fix this?

Appreciate the help in advance.

Flipsky is good about radio silence.  I have 2 fsesc 6.6 that are having dropout problems and they are very shady about the whole thing.  My slave vesc will turn off if they sit for more than 45 seconds idle. Their response was to update firmware,  when that didn't work their response was to downgrade firmware....

Hi all, I have been having issues connecting to the slave esc with the Dual VESC 6.6 CAN BUS.

1. I have gone through the motor setup with each VESC. 
2. The switch says "ON"
3. Both ESCs have solid blue and green lights. with matching firmware.

Not sure what else to try, all the settings seem to be correct.

I'm a little bit confused. What happens when you connect to your master using the USB port? If you do, make sure can fwd isn't active. Also, I believe new Vesc tool automatically assigns the VESC ID. It's not always 0 or 1. Check that.

If you're trying to communicate to your other Vesc using can fwd coming from port that's connected via USB, make sure this is on true:

So I've still been having trouble with using the SWD Prog menu on the vesc tool to try and recover the slave half of my unit, and I ended up connecting all the corresponding wires of the SWD ports together, including the 3.3v power pins after failed attempts without them. I was hesitant because some of the official videos from Ben don't show the vcc pins connected when doing vesc recovery.
https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0011/4039/1996/files/V6_5_4db44da5-bfd3-4044-bfc6-4ef41a4b79a1_2048x2048.jpg?v=1541575164  

 and surprisingly the slave vesc lit up! I connected to it via the SWD Prog menu and it found it's microcontroller successfully. Unfortunately each time I select the vesc six firmware to flash with, I would click ‘Upload’ and the master vesc would loose connection to the vesc tool and the terminal would print out this stack trace:

Hey Man,

I tried to install a Flipsky Dual 6.6 plus ESC on my Electric Skateboard which has a Enertion 2.1 DIY Hub Motor Kit. 

During initial programming, one of the LED's on the Slave Side turned off for no apparent reason. Try as I might, it never came back on.

I thought I must have messed up the ESC during programming, and I really liked the form factor and advertised specifications of the Flipsky Dual 6.6 Plus ESC, so I ordered another Flipsky Dual 6.6 Plus and talked to Flipsky about exactly how to program it. 

When it finally arrived, I made it nearly to the end of the initial programming before the same LED turned off on the Slave side of the board. That Slave side LED never came back on. They told me that when that LED turns off, it basically means you need to send the ESC back to them so they can remove and reinstall a new 64 pin Computer Chip.

So anyway, I ended up making a deal with them and actually got a 3rd Flipsky Dual 6.6 Plus ESC. This time, I had Flipsky with me on my Laptop via teleconference as I attempted the initial programming. 

Same problem, the LED on the Slave side turned off and never came back on. Only this time, with Flipsky's assistance, it failed faster than the 2 previous attempts.

At that point I received a Focbox Unity which has been running well. But here is the CLUE: With the FOCBOX Unity, I can see that the internal Temperature Sensor in my Slave Side Hub Motor is malfunctioning. With the FOCBOX Unity ESC, this does not cause any problem. However, it is the only imperfection in my system. Therefore, it is my assumption that for some reason, the Flipsky Dual 6.6 Plus is vulnerable to failure if anything connected to it electrically is imperfect. 

I had seen on a video a guy saying that FOCBOX Unity had been designed to be able to withstand some problems in other system components, a Temperature Sensor for example.

So in conclusion, if You ended up ordering another Flipsky Dual 6.6 Plus ESC and are planning on trying to do the Initial programming exactly the same as you did the first time, I would recommend checking your Motor Resistances, your Motor sensors, and your in wheel temperature sensors before you try to do the initial programming again. 

 And if possible, I would probably cut the wire in the ribbon cable that connects the in wheel temperature sensors to the Flipsky Duall 6.6 Plus ESC before initial programming and see if You can get through the initial programming without any of the LED's going out.

Do some riding. if all is well, maybe leave those in-wheel temperature sensor wires disconnected. Or, if you want to do an experiment, try reconnecting them and see if the LED goes off or stays on. 

Good Luck
```

I'll tell You what I know of the top of my head.

When I tried the Flipsky Dual 6.6Plus, it was a relatively new product.
I could not get it to work with my Raptor 2.1 Hub Motors. I think that the reason might have been a bad thermal sensor in one of my Hub Motors, but I am not sure.

If You are only going to use 2 motor wheels, and You have the space for it,I would recommend the Regular sized Flipsky6.6 which has much beefier components and a better track record.

If You are using all brand new parts, the FlipskyDual 6.6 regular or plus might work, but keep in mind that you may need to program it absolutely perfectly the first time. So you might want to write to flipsky to get a general procedure for how to program it since one does not come with the ESC. 

Also, You might want to try programming it with both of the temperature sensor wires disconnected to see if you can get it running that way. 

Basically, it is my unverified opinion that  Flipsky's Dual 6.6 Plus is vulnerable to errors during programming that are somehow related to what is connected to the Sensor Ribbon Cable.

So You might consider setting up for the first time in a mode that does not utilize the Hall Sensors either. 

The Focbox Unity has been treating me right and I would recommend it personally. But the Flipsky units do have a nice form factor and some impressive specifications, I just could not get it to work.

One good thing about Flipsky is that have the product in inventory and ready to ship. But if You go with Flipsky, I would try the regular one first, and if you get the much smaller and more recently introduced 6.6 plus, I would be very cautious during programming, and possibly start with temperature sensors disconnected and maybe in a sensorless mode, as well.

Have a good one.

P.S. Never buy used Rubber Wheels for your Electric Skateboard.

Thanks Airwolf,

  Sounds pretty informative. I’m building a new board after breaking the old kit, it’s gonna be belt drive 2 motors. When you mean all brand new parts, you meant if I was doin fresh build right? If the plus version is no different from the regular one (other than the fact that the regular one is beefier).

 I use it to commute to work actually, I get nearly get 40km of range on (10s5p) 360Wh so I’m pushing it to (13s5p) 702Wh to guarantee the range. So perhaps the regular one might take the load better than the plus

Ok guys,  I'm having the same exact problem with my brand new 6.6 dual mini.  If the board sits for 30+seconds one side of the esc will shut down.  I had this exact problem with the simplify also

I had a 6.6 mini sample go poof on 1 side too - won't be ordering any more of those... Seems like they haven't really gotten the size:performance down properly/there are shortcuts being taken that shouldn't be.

Biggest crap... I've got the 6.6 plus. One setting up 2 sides were working. then I applied some pressure to the motor to simulate real word strain on the motor and I saw a spark. Slave side dead. 5V is present but 3,3V is not. then couple of days later I turn on the board to test it for the first time because I got some pulleys and it didn't want to go and my remote didnt want to pair. I thought that the receiver must've came lose. I open it up and I see only one blue light on the slave side. Master is now dead too. No 5V or 3,3V...

![20191006_171845|690x388](upload://25NKWq80Vh9Vwpm26uhhTwlkdNX.jpeg) Blew this capacitor while my board was idle. Can anyone tell me what it's for and if I can fix it thanks. The board powers on and will throttle up but will start blinking and seem to lose connection.
