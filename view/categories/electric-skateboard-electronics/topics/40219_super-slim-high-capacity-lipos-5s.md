Anyone know of any? I’m a little surprised hobbyking and the like haven’t started making them yet. I guess that just tells me how small this hobby still is :/

super slim is not very clear...
if you want a flat pack (less than 10mm) you'll have to solder it yourself. but its not worth it.

a small fat pack works much better. most are 50mm thick or less....

You could buy 2S packs  with wires on them and solder them up for whatever number of cells you want. Still relatively thin and easier to work with than soldering up single cells.

I use these 6s packs. They are a personally measured 34mm thick and 205mm long.

To be more clear I guess I was hoping there was a 5S pack 18mm or less in height.....
