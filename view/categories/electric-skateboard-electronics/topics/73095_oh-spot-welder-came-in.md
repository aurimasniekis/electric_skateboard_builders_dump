welds look good if a bit soft, have you done any testing to see if you can tear it off?

If this is a 120V model, go slow on the spot welding.

Yeah, the second layer of those nickel strips look like theyâ€™ll peel right off. You also want to trim the sharp edges off the corners.

Like @mikenyc already said, have a look at this corners

You donâ€™t use fishpaper rings on the positive terminal which makes it even more easy in case the Nickel corner bend down to cause a short.

i not so much worry about the missing fish paper rings.
i more worry about the nickle corners which i marked.
would be better if they would be rounded so that they lay on
the positive terminal and canÂ´t bend down.

I donâ€™t know how you plan to snip it, but how ever take care that you donâ€™t short something with the tools you use ðŸ˜‰
