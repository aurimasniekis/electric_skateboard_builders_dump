Hey guys, I got my batteries to build a 10S4P pack and I went ahead and tested them all individually and they're all reading 3.42V.  I'm still new to this but shouldn't they be 4.2? I'm assuming the distributor doesn't charge them all the way up.  I can't try charging them yet because I don't have my BMS yet.

That's shipping voltage, every battery ships like that because it does not explode if  haywire happens. completely normal, and u need to charge before use, heard if you don't u can have unstable cell. People says it is okay with recent good batteries but it is recommended
