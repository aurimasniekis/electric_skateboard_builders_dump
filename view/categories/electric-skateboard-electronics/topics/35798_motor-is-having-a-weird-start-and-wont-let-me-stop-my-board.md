Been setting up my board and it pretty much rides perfect until I press reverse/brake.

It feels like its skipping or braking and going and braking and going like the magnet is not strong enough.

But it also does this at low rpm (When I just press forward), it looks like something in this video but just for a short second or so and only at really low rpm until it goes up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LWg9d_lAEU

How do I solve this? Im using a vesc so i guess its some setting i need to change.

Can you make a video of the first problem?

For the video, did you hook up sensors? without them it can cog until it gets going.

Sensorless motor, or it has a sensorcable but shipping broke it.

I can, but its hard to notice it.

Sounds normal for a sensorless setup then. You did and applied motor detection right? Post your VESC settings

I did, ill have to take my board apart give me 5 min.

And it legit cant brake at all due to this, it just does this thing when i hit the brake and it kinda slows down a little but it keep doing it as long as i hit the brake.

Not sure, its the lastest though i just flashed it yesterday.

But looks like my board is out of charge, my remote blinks red and it wont connect to my pc so ill have to charge it before i can be sure about my settings and such.
