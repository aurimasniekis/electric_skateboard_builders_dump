Hey Guys,

my first Post on this Forum, glad to be here.

I'm currently Building/Ordering parts for my first DIY board. I'm trying to use some nice pneumatic tires and found these in a kit. Has anyone used it or has a better alternative in the same price range?

[DIYeboard Offroad Kit](http://www.diyeboard.com/11-offroad-allterrian-power-truck-kit-with-8-pneumatic-tires-p-576.html)

Thanks alot!

Very cheap components to be honest and the companies ethics are questionable.  If you are on a very tight budget then anything that gets you rolling is fine but you will be upgrading before too long so weigh that up.

i've heard bad things but primarily on the airless AT Tires and the Batterys.  At first i was going to buy it from Torqueboard but it was sold out.

Thanks. Not really a tight budget but not willing to spend 500 bucks on just the front truck for example.

Are you going full on mountain board or a longboard with pnuematics?

Look at what you get when you pay $350 plus tax

What you could have gotten/get

Bergmeisters - I can't remember what they cost but the sale price was unbeatable
Then any trucks out there - MBS , TB 218MM, surfrodz

Tbh, I think the following components are of an acceptable quality from diyeboard:

- Dual belt ESC for a cheapo setup if you're heavier, its pretty smooth.
- 6" Airless tires and hubs again if you're heavier. If you're light you need to ziptie them to the hub or they expand. The hub is also a cheap 6" metal hub which can be used with the alibaba 6" pnumatic tires everyone uses
- Their clone wheels
- Their belts
- Their enclosures
- Vanguard clone
- Their hub motors 
- N5055 Motors if you're on a budget these will work pretty well

Things to 100% avoid
- All batteries
- Crappy trucks w/ non adjustable mounts
- Their red motors 

I have seen the trucks you linked used in a very edge case extreme AT scenario and they held up well. They might work out.

I'm a 210 punds/ 95KG rider. What i already have are the Motors (Dual 6374), Dual Vescs and the batterys, nothing from DIYeboard. The Truck kit would be the only thing.

Oh right well with those motors I wouldn't use their trucks personally.

For full MTB you need MBS Matrix 2 or trampa. That's already 170$. Plus mounts,  that's around 150. Plus hubs, tires,  pulleys, that's 150.

Save up for the high quality parts like Trampa or MBSMatrix. It feels so good after you've bought high quality parts and had the joy of assembling them and tweaking them for hours and then finally get on your premium ride!
 Also with better parts comes better support. If you bought those cheap trucks and they came completely dissembled and there were tons of screws and bolts and had no clue how to put them together. you'd be waiting ages for a reply from them if they even do reply. but if you bought from Trampa no only are there loads of people on the forum able to help but you'd probably get a reply from them within an hour or two! You get where I'm going with this :thinking: :rofl:

@xsynatic basically everything was said already.
Don‚Äôt cheap out on the trucks.
Trampas or matrix2 are the best choice at the moment. The matrix2 will be updated with a aluminum base plate in the binging of 2019, maybe it makes sense to wait for it.
If no, there is always the etoxx webshop https://www.e-toxx-shop.com/
@Nowind makes some high quality stuff for emtbs.

If you want to safe some money you can get used trucks from people here. There always some for sale.
If you buy things from mbs you can save 15% buy using this code

When I was first starting out (and waiting to accumulate all the parts for my Carver) I built a couple of beater budget boards for myself and some friends using just their AT trucks/airless wheels. Went with maytech motors and flipsky VESCs and some decks I had made locally and ended up being around $600 in parts. I guess I went into it knowing that they were cheap throwaway parts that I intended on thrashing, but I had fun with them.

Don't get me wrong, it's definitely worth it to spend more and build with much higher quality components. These were just a quick & convenient route to get a couple of boards up for summer. The quality leaves much to be desired, there's no ability to adjust the belt, and you'll burn up watts like crazy with the highly inefficient airless tires. They also wear bare in about 400 miles. 

If they were $100 for tires + trucks on a beater sure, but they simply aren't sustainable as a long term solution for any decent board.
