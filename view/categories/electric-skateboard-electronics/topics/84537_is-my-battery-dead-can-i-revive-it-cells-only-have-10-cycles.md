I thought I had done everything right ! 
I left the battery sit at 36 V for winter. 
When I go to check on the battery since sun came back
I was at only 2,35 volt..... 
Each cells are wether at 0 v or 0,35 v 

There's nothing I can do right ? Like all those brand new 30Q cells must go to trash ?

Was it connected to voltage meter / vesc/ antispark? Mines been sitting in my closet just chilling for the last 5 months... Nothing has happened ðŸ¤”

Lithium based batteries do not get damaged solely from being over discharged.

What will kill a lithium cell is pulling reasonable amounts of power at low voltages. When this happens the electrolyte will "offgas" and build up pressure within the cell. This is what causes prismatic cells to puff. Internal resistance will increase as voltage drops, and any drawn power will cause electrolyte decomposition.

Luckily for you, these cells were not under load at such a low voltage. They simply discharged VERY slowly. This probably did not damage them.

Do NOT try to power anything with them, as this could cause instant permanent damage.

You can likely recover these cells. You'll need a non-standard charger like a bench power supply that can do CCCV.

Set the voltage to your max pack voltage, and limit the current to 0.25 - 0.5A. The lower you set this, the higher the likelyhood of recovery and the slower the pack will charge. You can do the math regarding how long it would take to charge (5Ah pack at 0.5A would take 10 hours, etc)


You also have the option of charging each P group individually by using the same current settings but setting your voltage to 4.2V. I would highly recommend this over charging the whole pack at once as your series groups are likely out of wack.

Did you say some are at 0V and some are at 2.35?

If they are actually at 0V then those P groups are toast. And you won't be able to replace them with new cells as the new cells wouldn't match well with the other recovered ones.

I'm hoping the 0V was just a measurement error. Could you give a detailed list of all the P group voltages?

If the cells are seriously that out of wack, then your BMS is probably what caused it and is toasted.

Thanks for the reply guys.

To clarify : the whole pack is at 2,40 v 
Each P group is between 0,34 and 0,45 V 

The only charger I have are regular ones, and a 4S lipo charger... 
What should I buy to restore this battery ? All the cells are brand new it would be a shame not to try to revive them. 

The battery was sitting with just an antispark plugged into it.. maybe that's the culprit

What I would do is to try to charge each individual group separately with some power supply with limiting resistor in between. Take any 5V power supply (like USB power supply) and add a resistor in between say 50ohms will max pass 100milliAmps, Add a mutimeter to check the voltage that it will never exceed 4.2V in a cell. When you have reach say 3.7Volts, you can start charging the next group untill all groups are 3.7Volts. Then you can start charging the pack normally. Some chargers refuse to charge empty cells.

I have tried with my lipo charger... No luck it says low voltage and won't charge
@TowerCrisis BMS is charge only 

Whole pack voltage : 3,30v at charge port and 4,14 v at output
P1 - : 00,28 v
P2: 00,28v
P3: 0,28v
P4: 00,44v
P5: 00,45v
P6:00,46v
P7:00,47v
P8:00,48v
P9:00,48v
P10 +: 00,48v

than use nicd and try again or increase the amps but dont do it for too long.

youve gotta be fast

as soon as the group hits 3v switch to lipo immedieatly

Yeah I have to be fast before the voltage drops again ? 
I am currently charging P1 at 0,2 amps to avoid any stress on the cells. 
P1 went from 0,28 to 1,79 v in a few minutes of charging

cant recommend one, as my i charger does the trick most of the time.

you know you can charge at higher amps for shorter periods right (chances are that will boost the voltage up higher and faster)

^not recommend

and why not take the pack apart and do each cell individually? chances are one or two cells are damaged.

I better do each P and see afterwards I definitely don't want to unweld and spot weld everything again. I hope I have no dead cells on the pack. But from what I've seen none are dead. 
I already charged the first P to 3,7 volts without issue 
I LL keep doing that to each P tomorrow

If for nothing demanding, like just charging batteries, you can buy whatever bench power supply you find as long as it has 60V/5A output or two 30V outputs which can you connect in series and obviously full control of voltage and current.
Preferably switching one which won't be heavy like traditional linear one.

I'm currently using MCH-K305D and Agilent E3647A.

No no no no! So many bad ideas recommend in this thread.

The ONLY way you can do this safely and with control is with a bench power supply, charging each P group individually.

If you don't have one, get one. This is definitely not the last time you'll use it.

Yup. i've done this before, setting the charger to nimh/nicad, charging the lithium pack for a 5-10 seconds to get voltage just high enough for the charger to detect, once detected, switch to lithium mode and charge as normal.

This would be a very good time to invest in a Lab Power supply.
And as @TowerCrisis suggested, it will come in very handy more than once.
I got one and it is all I use for maintenance, testing and even daily charging.
Once you've used a Lab supply, you'll never want to use a brick charger again except for portable charing.
If you don't want to go all out, you can save some money with a 60v 3a supply.

Yeah, I have revived slowly discharged cells too. Just connect them to hobby charger(with nimh mode) and charge at a low current like 100mA/cell, until a parallel group reaches 3.1V or so, then charge on a regular li-ion charge. 

I have a hobbyking charger that does the job

True, you can't control it - at least not found one yet you can.

But for someone who is lacking equipment it's really cheap and feels pretty safe if you monitor it closely

I recieved it today and I did the silliest mistake, didn't switched the unit to 220v 
When turned On I heard a BUZZzzz inside the unit and since then it's a brick. 
I don't see any internal damage... Have I fried the thing ? I hate myself sometimes... Money thrown away

So glad to see that it'll be up and running! Make sure to update us regarding cell balancing and what kinda range you're getting.

One last note, before you take it for a full ride please check if the cells are discharging evenly, take it for a few 100 meters then recheck the cell voltages. If there's a bad group you'll notice a voltage drop. Personally I would do this several times before trusting it.

Best of luck!

I LL share the results when I am done . I have charged each group to 3.2 v at 0.3 Anow I am doing a second round and charging them to 3.7v at 0.5a

Thanks for the tip. I will do that a few times before trusting the pack again, if you had to take a guess will I lost a lot of capacity ? It's only a 10S3p so if I lose a lot of capacity I will really feel it, as long I don't sag i'm fine :p

The danger is the damage if any is unlikely to uniform across all the cells. I think your chances are really good though.
