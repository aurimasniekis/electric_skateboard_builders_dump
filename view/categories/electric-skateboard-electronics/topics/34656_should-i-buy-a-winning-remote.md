It seems nice but I have red that its crap, that there were a few bad batches etc, connection breaks and it makes your motors stop, or should i go with benchwheel remote?

If you don‚Äôt mind dying, winning is just fine. If you don‚Äôt want to die, go with mini, gt2b, or benchwheel.

What about this

Yep, that‚Äôs a mini. The only concern with buying from China is the fact there is no warranty and if something goes wrong with it you are stuck with it. Buying from a shop here provides a warranty and a community to help you solve issues.

15$ isnt much, if it dies i have many rc cars and one rc boat and can use their remotes, also in my oppinion the battery has the highest chance of dying here and its like 2$

Thanks for your help now i have deieded on the remote!

The remote is hands down the most important part of an ESK8 build. The remote is the difference between a smooth and safe ride or a signal cut out that can cause serious injury.

Ive had good luck with both the winning and the mini. The winning has a very short throw though so Id only recommend it for low power boards. The mini has more throw and a better reputation for reliability but its also bigger amd uglier. Once I tried the GT2B there was no going back though.

@Acido if you buy the mini remote for cheap from China, you will have to wait a while for shipping. @Jlabs sells them for a bit more, but with faster shipping.

I use it daily. The two cons are as follows

1. You to calibrate every time you turn it on (quick flick all the way up and back down), which becomes less and less of deal when you get used to it.

2. If you turn the remote or board off, after a small period of time, it will be unable to pair once you turn the remote/board back on. To re-pair you have to turn both off and back on again. This means that if you're resting for a bit, you have to either leave both remote/board on or turn both off.

Nano V2 or Mini RC, Depends on whether you like thumb control or trigger control.

As for the Mini RC's
I bought them for $60 and $30 and last I bought a bunch of them on eBay for about $18 ea.
They all look and feel exactly the same. And they all seem to work exactly the same.
BTW, The one in the video with dual receivers is from eBay.

 I used Nanos on all my builds initially because they are compact and simple and look good. I really dont like that remote (nano) for high power 4wd builds though. You can tune your 4wd setup to work ok with the nano via various vesc settings, but high powered boards really need a longer throw on the trigger for good modulation between low and high power imo. Also, thumb throttles make it too easy to just lift your thumb and let the throttle pop back to the neutral position which can cause a massive deceleration that will easily send you flying.

Consider this simplified example. The nano has only 6mm of throw from neutral to full throttle. If you have a 120Amp 4wd board, thats 20Amps of power added for every mm of throttle applied. The GT2B remote has about an 24mm of throw which would be only 5Amps per mm.  Micromanaging your thumb movement is no fun. 

Nanos work fine on low to normal powered boards, but you mentioned 4wd so I figured Id share my experience with them. I have three of them but they are just sitting for now.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/9/e9989b646498b0081442576d04ff55c99d3924b5.jpg" width="374" height="500"> GT2B's are definately more expensive though. $30 remote, $28 3D printed enclousure, and 3 additional receivers at $7 each. About $80 total. All available on ebay.

Im not sure about using CAN across all 4, I'm talking about CAN between the 2 front and separately the 2 rear, then PPM between the front and back master. Though all this might be pointless if CAN works well across all 4

@scepterr @Jinra

4wd CAN: Same as 2wd CAN setting but with additional slaves. All are connected by a daisy chain can harness, and with different CAN ID's. 

It works, but doesnt seem robust. Ive tried 4wd CAN,  4wd split PPM, 4WD communication/tuning via CAN but control via ppm and front CAN with rear CAN connected via PPM. Still seemed to be plauged with random CAN tranceiver failures.  I gave up on CAN and split ppm for 4wd setups. It was suggested that connecting 4 vescs in parallel lowers the resistance on the can bus circuit too much, but I don't know if this was confirmed. I just run 4 receivers now and havent had a single vesc failure since.

Can anyone help me please?
I've connected the remote with the esc / motor as described in the manual. 
When I pull down the throttle my motor begins to "beep". Second time pulling down the throttle the motor "beeps" again and starts to run. If the throttle is in the middle position the motor is running. For braking I have to pull down the throttle.
Why is that? I want the motor inly to run when pushing the throttle up. 
What am I doing wrong? 

These are the parts I am using:

I bought the nano, but the transmitter doesn't seem to pair with the receiver. The receiver is flashing red, and should go to solid red when paired (but this doesn't happen). When I open my transmitter, I see there is a loose wire. Anyone knows where this wire has to go to?![06|690x459](upload://iJmiXnu8CyWyOYaT0sImvYEnr3N.jpeg)
