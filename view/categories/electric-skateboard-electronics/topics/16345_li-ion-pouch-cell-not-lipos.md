Iv'e noticed an increase in vanguard builds and also 18650 li ion cells. But is there a particular reason why you dont use more li ion pouch cells? They are thinner, have a greater form factor and can take up less space than a 18650. Check out these for example https://bmsbattery.com/ebike-battery/640-high-c-rate-10ah-li-nicomn-li-ion-cells-battery.html with these you could pay the same as for a 10s4p while getting the possibility of a flatter pack.

Pouch LI-ONS are used in our cell phone batteries I'm pretty sure.

exactly and i have found some that discharge just as many amps as our li ion 18650s, so what inhibits us from using them @longhairedboy ik u have done some work with pouches and u too @barajabali chaka

yes but were they more or less complicated to wiring then 18650s, I would think easier because u just wire them in series and ur done

can you take a look at the cells above and let me know what you think about the idea of using these to make a 10s pack

If only they were higher discharge rate.  Nice find. I've seen them before but not so cheap and with even THAT discharge ability.  Actually that's pretty high if its real.

Yea even the 10ah looks good.  Really nice find. Cheap.  Thin. ..but if it's the cobalt chemistry I wonder if ''tis any safer

i figure hteir safer than lipos and thinner than li ion only downside would be if they puffed inside enclosure, in my mind

Edit: i think for you they would be a good replacement for ur lipos while not  having to deal with power limitations of li ion

Looks like they're over 10 inches long - so would need to be stacked over 6s for a normal width deck?

discharge rate isnt too bad for a longboard. 50 amp cont.  The tabs look to be copper maybe? So you might not need aluminum flux core wire. 

Should work out just fine

haha i think ill give em a try if it works i think these could change the way we currently build our packs
edit: do you think the cells will hold up as well as the li ion cells? From what ive read they can sometimes expand

I'm looking to get them too but ship from china.  I'll write and call them when they wake up in a couple hours and see how long they'd take. 
I'd also like to see some reviews about how real the discharge rate is too.  
@willpark16 if ur around the Bay Area maybe we could group order.  Shipping is showing 70$

Might be finding the wrong info - cells look to be: 8.4mm X 60.5mm X 261mm

Wouldn't 10S either be: 650mm X 261mm or 325mm X 522mm

Over 10" wide either way?

Actually 303mm, not 325mm. But still close to 12" on that one.

Looks cool, but a 10s pack would be 4kg/8.8lbs...  a bit much for my needs.  Cost aside - too heavy.  Smaller (capacity) and ligher cells with half the weight and compromise on range would be a neat option.
```

## \#32 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2017-01-19T20:59:53.505Z Reads: 102

There's comprises and benefits. 
Looking from the cost perspective these are much cheaper based on cycle life. 

I didn't compare the weight and ah of these with lipo but I assume these are more energy dense ..more ah per ounce. Multistar had the best ratio of lipo and lg2 were much better and a 3500ah cell even better.  Lion having more energy to weight 

Copper tabs!

Slim at (2) 10ah stacked.  


The biggest downside is the lack of power I fear these would have with the sag unless I go big.  Changed my mind on these.  Had my hand on the card. Think I like to collect batteries.
But for just a slightly lower powered slim board they'd be great

I don't see how these will result in a more compact pack than round cells. They are 26cm long and 6cm wide - that is huge. Even if you stack them and use two stacks next to each other they are basically the same size as a neatly stacked 18650 pack.
```

These have very low energy density. 
For every pouch, you can fit at least 7 cells (I'm assuming 18650 are squares). That means that for a 36V 15Ah pack you can fit a 36V 17.5Ah pack if you use GA cells you can get 24.5Ah and 70A cont discharge, if you get VTC6 you get 21Ah and 210A cont discharge

these cells are 150% the square mm to energy of a typical 3ah 18650 cell.  weird. not much in them. 


these are 9.9 x 60 x 260mm for 15ah so 105,300 square mm.
compared to the volume of (5)18650 cells at 18 x 65 x 90 and 154,440  square mm

Hey, 
the chemistry is the same as in the common 18650 cells. Its Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 used as cathode material (NMC). As a battery chemist I would not recommend using these cells. 

i) A 10 Ah pouch cell is way more vulnerable than a 3000 mAh cylindrical cell with a hard metal case. Blowing up a 10 Ah cell is not funny, i can assure you.

ii) It was already mentioned that the pouch cells are prone to gasing. ItÂ´s actually the same case with the cylindrical cells but pouch cells do not have a safety valve to release the gas. The risk to crack your case because of a blown up cell is likely.

iii) A stack of these cells is generating much more heat, especially when drawing to much current. The heat dissipation could be an issue though.

iiii) 5C (=50 Amps) constantly drawn from one cell will destroy the material very fast. I would not go with more than 2 C  for each cell.  

For that reasons I would recommend to stick with the 18650s or in the near future with 20700 cells from the gigafactory ;)

Best
