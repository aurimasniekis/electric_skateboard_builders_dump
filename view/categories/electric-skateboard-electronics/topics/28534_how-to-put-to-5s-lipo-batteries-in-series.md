Buy or create a cable like that. You need yo connect the positive of brick one to negative of brick two. The remaining positive and negative become the main output. It's Plenty of tutorials if you google it

If your going to charge them with a hobby charger and need to seperate them for charging, Then 5.5mm bullet connectors work well for easy series connecting and disconnecting for individual charging <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/c/bc022cb17de76b77561c1209eb73a67b3b40429e.jpeg" width="372" height="500">
