I recently bought some Maytech VESCs from @psychotiller and immediately threw one on my single drive 6374 build (my first build ever) and rode it for a day, about 15 miles, before the board just quit on me out of nowhere. Went back to the apartment to find that it was the dreaded DRV error code. I was running 40 battery amps on the 50 amp VESC, and not giving it hell, so I have no idea why it died. I contacted Maytech's customer service and it took them days to respond, started talking about the issue and haven't heard anything back. That leads to the title: Everyone loves @JohnnyMeduse. However, I don't see the point of dropping 50+ moneys into a VESC that is probable to fail again. So, advice. Fix, or do not fix?

Your settings don't seem to be out of bounds.

Did it blow while accelerating or braking or cruising or just when you turned the board on?

As far as it being worth fixing your Vesc, I think it would if you can have the burnt DRV replaced with an upgraded DRV.
And maybe upgrade any other components that would help it's dependability.
@JohnnyMeduse would be more able to advise on that.

I would also recommend that you inspect your motor phase wires very carefully and especially where they come out of the motor and just inside the exit hole.
It is possible for the wires to short out when there insulation is worn through by rubbing against the motor case.
Shorted phase wires will blow the DRV chip.

OK... If you wonder, yes I think it is worth repairing. To be honest I don't have repair a lot of Maytech Vesc, which mean that they are not as bad as people think they are. I'm pretty sure if we just change you DRV and check to see if other components are defective it might work for a long time.

You should create your own thread, document your experience with the repair guy

Then see if the repair guy can take on more work and see what happens from there
