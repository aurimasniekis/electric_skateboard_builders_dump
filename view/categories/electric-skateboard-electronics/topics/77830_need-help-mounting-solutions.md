I bought a dual VESC from Flipsky. It has 6 slots for mounting as can be seen below.

I want to mount it to my deck. I have an enclosure but it doesn't have a place for mounting the ESC and the battery. Someone told me that I can use Velcro but I am not sure how well Velcro will handle the heat coming from the VESC as I imagine the side with the heat sink is the side that should be in contact with the deck. Another option is metal glue?

Can someone please suggest some good mounting options for the VESC and the battery as well ? What do DIY builders usually use?

Thanks in advance!

I highly doubt in normal situations that it'll make that much heat. Velcro would be the easiest option. Stop over thinking it and use velcro lol

I personally use 3M double stick foam tape for things like this.  If you wanna get me the exact center to center distances of the screw holes I can make you a 3D printable model which you can use to mount the VESC on and them mount the model to the deck.  Kind of like what @JLabs does with his FocBox mounting plate.

Thank you that'll be awesome. I just contacted Flipsky for the specs. As soon as they let me know, I'll get back to you.

FYI my FSESC is this one

The velcro strips that are industry grade strength only operator at a temp of -30 - 150 F. Is this OK to be used with the ESC?

Thats the important bit.  You can ride with that shit without an enclosure.  Make sure its a good quality velcro though something like the 3m.  Not some cheapo amazon knock off.  They cheap out on the adhesive backing and when you come to remove the component the glue gives out before the velcro.

More importantly though is your tag.  With a name like that you need a proper avatar.
