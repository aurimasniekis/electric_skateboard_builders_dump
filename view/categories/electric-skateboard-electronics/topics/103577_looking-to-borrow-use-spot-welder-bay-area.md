Hey everybody,   
I'm getting to the point in my build where I have everything I need, now I just need to put it all together. If there is anybody in the San Francisco Bay area that has a spot welder I can use, that would be fantastic. I'm trying to avoid buying one because I don't plan on building more than one pack for my board. Anyway, thanks, have a good one.
