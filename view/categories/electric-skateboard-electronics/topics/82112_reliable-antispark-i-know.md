Hey so I've had 3 antisparks blow up on me In a row all within 4 days of ussage on each, and one blew when I plugged my batt in.

By blew I mean they won't turn off.

And yes I did use the search bar but people just get to techchinal and my brain blows up.

Not gonna name names except for 2 of em, flipsky, lunacycle 

My question is just God damn fu*"kin recommend me a good antispark that's compact godamit that won't blow within a month, except for a loopkey.

@b264

This is the reason why people use prebuilt esc and not vesc.

It didn't blow Durning a ride but actually just sitting around

If you have a round hole and some space you can do a door knob style loopkey but its probably more effort than filing a square hole

I got one for secret santa this past year and its still holding up. Not sure where its from. Maybe ask @Grozniy who my santa was.

Is not the cheapest but, I hope it's the last I have to buy, at least for this build:

Get the Fatboy. By design it should never break like the others do.

[I explained why they fail](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vedder-antispark-design-problem-or-implementation-problem/77967/4?u=b264) and that you probably shouldn't use them at all right now :expressionless:

Unless you get one with a precharge circuit

Does this failure mode apply to the fat boy too? I thought the resistor saves the mosfets?

Nope, they are one of the only put ones that have precharge.

No; they are the only one I know of that has a precharge circuit, circled here in red.

That does the same thing as the green stripe and resistor on a loop key.

How does it not spark when you plug it in? I couldn't find the details on your build thread.

It is an anti spark connector

I drilled a hole in the eboosted enclosure, I glued the as150 case to the enclosure with superglue. 


there is no printing

it is an antispark connector hence the name AS150
