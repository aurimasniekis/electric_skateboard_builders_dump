I am using this esc substitute with a 6S lipo battery and the remote and the battery are both charged but when it is all connected the motor with not spin. The power button light is flickering except when the remote is held all the way back in full brake then the light is solid. Why isnâ€™t this working and how do I fix this?

```
The flickering on the power button is normal


But you might have your esc set to the wrong voltage

My remote is paired properly I tripled checked and the esc is set up for the correct voltage. I contacted the supplier and they told me to disconnect the hall wire and try again. What is the hall wire?

```
The hall is the cable (in your case five wires) which is connected to the white socket on the esc
