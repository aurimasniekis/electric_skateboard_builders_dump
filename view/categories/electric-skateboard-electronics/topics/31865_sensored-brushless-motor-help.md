Hi so I Built my first Esk8 a couple months back using an Alien motor and esc--both sensored. I recently decided to connect the sensor plugs, which required a bit of soldering ad trial and error. On the third try(having tried two other pole wire combinations) the motor finally turned when commanded. Even though it does turn much more slowly withe torque now(as any sensored motor should), it makes a different sound a low RPM than after a certain speed where it becomes quiet again, like if it switched between sensored and sensorless mode? Also when it spins the other it does not make the same sound and seems to start a a higher rpm, like if it wasn t sensored. Is that normal? Could I have not the right wire cmbination(=more than 3 combinations?)I can t find much info online.
I have attached a link to the video showing the motor spinning:

Pictures on your hall sensor wires and how you connected them to your ESC:
