```
So my controller failed last summer and I havent touched my board until now (Ollin VESCs, 12s battery, Carvon dual motors).  Everything is about 1 year old and I have not been keeping up with the new hardware and firmwares.  I went to download the BLDC tool for OSx and it will not connect to either of my Ollin VESCs.  I cant find any old version and Im at a loss on what to do next.
