What are you guys running for lipo battery packs on your MTB builds. I plan to use lipos and want to get better range than 12 miles. I am currently running a 5x 2s 5ah pack on my street board and it's great. Could I just double this for a MTB and double range?

From my knowledge MTB's chew up a lot more power so I don't think you will be doubling the range. Something like 1.5x the range sounds like a good number

I am trying to figure out how to wire 4 6s batteries together for max range.

12s 8ah and only 8 miles, Man those MTB''s are really juice hogs aren't they?
That setup on a street board would get you close to 20 miles

Yea, it's all because of soft wheels, this guy did an interesting experiment

Test result
- Trampa wheel 8000mA
- Onda wheel 5000mA
With hard wheels it's nearly twice as efficient.

Personally on 8s 10ah i get 15-16km.
I was using 4x 4s 5ah 25c turnigy batteries.

Unfortunately 6 of these batteries in 12s config burned my vescs, so i'm waiting for new escs now.
