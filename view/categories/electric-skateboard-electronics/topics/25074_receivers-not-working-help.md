I finally got my first esk8 build put together and to the point where I could test ride. It worked fine but I needed to change the belt tension. The next day I went to take another test ride and the receiver would not turn on. I thought maybe it broke so I ordered a new receiver. Now I have two receivers and neither will turn on. I busted out the multimeter and I am getting 5 volts from the besc on my esc all the way down the wire to the pins to where it connects to the receiver. The receivers led light will not come on even though it is receiving 5v. Does anyone have any ideas? Please help!
here is a youtube link to my setup
