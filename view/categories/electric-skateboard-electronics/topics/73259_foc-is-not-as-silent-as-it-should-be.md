Set a pair of Ownboard hubs up in sensored FOC but it sounds so wrong compared to what it should sound like.

Almost metallic in away, far of what it sounds like in other peoples builds and with their own ESC.

What could be wrong?

Wanna note ive only done the basic FOC settings via vesc tool nothing fancy.

Check your switching frequency. Higher = quieter

Currently set at 20,0 kHz, safe to go higher?

30 is quiet. It increases esc heat a bit supposedly but not a danger
