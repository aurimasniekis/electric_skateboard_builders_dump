Here is my problem.
I changed the 6355 sealed Maytech motors with 6374 sealed Maytech on my Evo. Both motors are supposed to be 190kv but I am not so sure if this is the case.
Now the board has weak high speed brakes, low speed is fine.
VESC settings:
Motor Current Max Brake:-50A
Battery Current Max Regen:-10A

Normally I would increase the Battery Current Max Regen to something like -20A but since I use a discharge BMS in this board I am afraid it will trigger the BMS protection.
The BMS is the Besttech HCX-D223V1 and the Maximal continuous charging current is 20A so I am already at the limit.

Do any of you guys have any suggestions? (apart from bypassing the BMS of course).

Weird cause my 6374s had significantly stronger braking than my 6355s both 190kv

I would raise it to -12 battery amps and try it out. Usually when braking it's for a short amount of time so it would be an amp spike not a constant so even the BMS should be able to handle it. 

What battery are you using?

Yeah, I can't figure out why.
I use a 12S5P 30Q so handling more current for a short time is not a problem, it is the BMS I am worried about.
On my other board with a charge only BMS I have the batt regen around -30A .

Wtf..... How heavy are you ðŸ¤£and dual or single?

78kg, maybe close to 90kg with gear and backpack.
Dual, however it is pretty steep where I live.

-30a per vesc?

Just curious. What vesc version and brand do you have? Also, what firmware?

Focboxes, FW 3.51.

The other board (the one with the bypassed BMS) has VESC6.

did you re-do motor detection?  you should be able to go to -12 on max regen without issue, i mean try it out to make sure, but you should be ok.  That's my minimum, and that is really soft brakes IMHO.

I did motor detection after I changed motors. Everything is working great apart from the high speed braking which is kind of weird since I did not have any problem with the 6355s.
I am just afraid that if I go over the BMS's maximum charge current it may at some point shut down and I am left without brakes.

At this point I am thinking that bypassing the BMS may be the only solution.

I would bypass the BMS, I've had too many issues with Charge/Discharge BMS's including e-switch failures, random cutouts on brakes (even at really low amps).  To be clear 90% of the BMS's Ive used in charge/discharge have been fine, but the bad 10% have me gun shy now.

Depending on you rBMS you may be able to direct swap the balance lead connector making the change out to a charge only BMS pretty fast and easy.  The BesTech D140 is pretty great, I've used 10 or 12 and have only had 1 bad BMS.

If you have a BT module you can pad up and test the brakes at different levels to see if it cuts out at -12a per vesc, my feeling is that it wont, assuming the BMS is not faulty.
