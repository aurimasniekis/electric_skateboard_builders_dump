I'd honestly shop for a different remote.
Just my opinion. I've just seen too many issues with that remote over the past 2 years.

For the same price you can get a flipsky vx2 if you go to the other forum ( forum ) and join the group buy there

Or even just get a flipsky vx1 solid remote for a low price

Good advice from the other guys. If you want a mini I have loads for pence.
