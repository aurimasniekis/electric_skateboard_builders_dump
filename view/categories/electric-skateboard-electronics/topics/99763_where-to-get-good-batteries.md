I have been building for a while now and I'm wondering where everyone gets their batteries, I need something kind of custom right now so any suggestions would be appreciated!

Depends on where you are based there are battery builders in the forum

https://www.imrbatteries.com/ is a good US vendor, and https://www.nkon.nl/ is a good EU vendor. There are more but letting us know your region is a better start üëç

E: woops I thought you meant cells, not packs. 

I recommend @hyperIon1 (only one I've purchased from previously) as well as @psychotiller, @barajabali and @longhairedboy for US packs, and @pjotr47 for EU packs
