I keep getting cutoffs when I don't expect them from my first build. The LED flashes red on the ESC and then control comes back after about 3S. They seem to happen more often when I've driven the board for a while. When I charge the 6S LiPo-battery it is down to about 24,4V, is that too low? The battery shouldn't be empty so fast I think. I'm trying to figure out what other reason there can be. Maybe the BLDC settings or overheating perhaps? Is there a way to get the VESC to record whats going on ( without a computer connected)?
