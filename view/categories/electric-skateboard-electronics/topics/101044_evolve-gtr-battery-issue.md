So here’s my issue, I went down a fairly steep hill yesterday while my board was at 89% and it took me maybe 20-30seconds from top to bottom. When reaching the bottom the remote showed the board now at 100% and the remote disconnected and then a few seconds later reconnected. Evolve service says it may be a BMS issue and should be sent in yet the board since then has been performing normally, given I haven’t put a huge amount of strain on the braking side of the board since. Any help for if it really is worth sending in and not having a board for weeks?
