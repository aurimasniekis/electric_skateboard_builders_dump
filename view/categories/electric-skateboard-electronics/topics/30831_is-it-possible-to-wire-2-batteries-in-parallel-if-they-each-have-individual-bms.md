I have 2 space cell 3's I was wondering if I could wire then in parallel to make a 10s6p battery I understand I'd need to charge them separately and I could wire the switches so they turn on together but will this be a problem?

Yes. It's possible to do this, however they need to be exactly the same cell count and mah...

Putting them together in p will make them balance each other. There's no reason with the right amp charger you couldn't charge them both at the same time.

I'm still considering this cause I'd have to make an enclosed for the second battery maybe it's just easier to carry the second battery in my back pack and swap them out
