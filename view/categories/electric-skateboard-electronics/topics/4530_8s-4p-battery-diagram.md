Was wondering what an 8s4p diagram would look like i starated with 8 packs of 4 parallel but i believe im doing this wrong so perhaps someone can help me. Im tring to use 18650 battery sleds and change out the wires with 10 gauge.

these are what the sleds look like, so this would be 1s2p correct?

Those are meant for charging 18650's in parallel so yes 1s2p technically. They aren't, however, made for discharging so I'm not sure the contacts will stand up or be able to deliver in terms of high amp discharge; the wires definitely aren't.

Don't bother with the sleds. The contact points on them literally melt at the high  current. Better off making the pack by soldering or spot welding. 

Also, the sleds would make your pack huge.

Nope, there are multiple diagrams.

first the one he linked will melt but not keystone 228/209
secont point also is not true, the sleds may increase overall size by 1-2cm in all directions.

I'm sorry, but if you are unable to see how to wire up the pack then you will definitely need to do some research and gain some confidence before doing so.

It is 8 sets of 4 parallel cells, wired in series.

It will be more than that. If he were to change all the wiring, it would be a ton of cables and would be quite large compared to doing it with hot glue and a spot welder. Probably around 30% larger.

I think I might be saying this wrong then but I understand the science behind how u do it I just want to know if anyone can make a diagram or show me one before I solder my wires. However from what I've been saying I'm going to assume u don't know how to so in which case I'll wait till someone else comes who knows how to do this

Haha. I don't know how to do it? It is one of the most basic concepts to understand. I am doing a 6S11P in my build. 

You want someone to make you a diagram yet you haven't specified the shape or configuration you want. You might want it 2 cells wide or 4 cells wide, then maybe stacked two high, or only side by side. We don't know your configuration to give you an exact wiring diagram.

Only info i can give you is, wire 8 sets of 4 parallel cells in series.

Also, if you mean balance leads/BMS wiring then i can help with the general info, but not exact as the pack isnt made yet.

so green is the connection between parallel packs an the numbers are balance lead connections

do you know how to make a pack like the one above except two separate packs of 8s 2p side by side and connected in series to make an 8s4p pack connected with balance connectors?

I'm assuming you're wondering how to handle the top blue bar series connection? You would just solder on the series connection when the 2 packs are stacked on each other, don't use one long strip/rod to connect both parallel cells.

```
be careful not to damage the cells with excess heat if you plan on soldering the rods to the cells. More than a couple seconds of contact on the cell is too much.

Yes. I'm assuming you just have extra copper rods on the middle 2 cells. They're both 1s4p packs.

I don't think you need reinforcement on the cells in parallel. The only reason you would do reinforcement is for series cells that only have one nickel strip connecting them. @whitepony demonstrated this in his 10s4p topspeed battery.

EDIT: I don't see colours on that picture so I can't really see what you are doing.
