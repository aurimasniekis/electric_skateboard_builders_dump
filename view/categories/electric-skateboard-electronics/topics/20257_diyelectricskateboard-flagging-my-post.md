His guys are flagging my post so it will be hidden here, pls help me spread the word, he is holdong my money, not giving me a refund although he approved it, he kept stalling me until he had stock today morning and then sent me a shipping e mail after a week conversations between him and me regarding my cancellation.

Dont let him and this forum silent me 

beware of this guy... i ordered the VESC a week ago and noticed only in the confirmation email that ti's a 'back-order' and that he is out of stock, immediately sent him an email asking to cancel my payment and order, and i ordered it from a different vendor. i contacted him (diyelectricskateboard) every day since then and they told me that the case is being taking care of and i don't need to contact them anymore. after a week of contacting and asking for cancellation he shipped the product toâ€¦

@treenutter @barajabali @laurnts 
Not cool if tb actually flagged this guy's post. He has a legitimate complaint which should be heard. 
Why is it that every time we have a complaint posted it just gets flagged, hidden, deleted and/or locked?
I've seen it happen with 4 different threads from different people all regarding diy...

I'd also flag it - has nothing to do with the category this is listed in and seems like just a rant.
Send it back once it arrives - what's the big deal?

The big deal is im contacting him  and paypal since this morning and he ignores my mails and didnt offer to send it back, also now i have to wait 2 months till it get here and back to him and than hope he will cancel the payment.

Well he asked to cancel way before it shipped, yet Dexter still shipped. Dexter won't cover return shipping either. 

Shipping it back should only cost $3 though but still Dexter needs to get someone to handle the customer service part for him.

Dexter has dropped his customer service quality when you get the product and ask to return it he talks for day later but says he doesn't see emails, or will follow up later and never does, I lost money from a faulty bms and his 6s esc fried on me then when I asked for an exchange he talked for days beating around the bush

His first posts are about the vesc and getting it to work after that he begins talking about dexter which he is not it the wrong to do the only issue is he should probably move it to another subcategory

so this is one of those vendor bashing topics then?

However this type of post has nothing to do in the e-board electronics section.

Yea @Idobartal to be honest this in appropriate to just create an account here and post complain as this forum is meant to help people build their board and not discovering / unveiling bad vendor.  However it's ok to keep it for now but it would be better next time if you show your build thread, comment on your build thread and complain there instead of making new one like this.

The thing is we can't help you anyway, what am I or the community suppose to do? every vendor have "their" downside sometimes and time to time. The risk when buying from vendor is always there and people have to accept that. If you read alot, you probably knew that diyelectricskateboard have problems posted here time to time, so better avoid that.

First, i flagged it too.

We had 5 of these 4 months ago about enertion, and we all deleted them because we agreed useing this forum for leverage was not the intended way.

But if you want, we can go back to the roots hand have these posts again.

Bohoho this did not happen,
My vesc was too late, such a shitty vendor.
Boohooo, Vendor X has delayyed shipment.

If we tolerate it anytoime, we will get 30 "My raptor 2 is still not here" posts when they should ship.

Im trying for a week, chated with him on his site around 7 times, everytime the same thing - "what about my refund, i dont need the vesc no more". The answer was the same -
Its gone up to management, you dont need to contact us no more.... 6-7 times! He replies! And then today morning, this...

Dude, shit happens.  If you give him a chance I am SURE he will make it right.  But being a full on dick is just going to get you ignored.  You can complain about him being a bad vendor, but you have a responsibility to be a good customer.  Money does not equal respect.

you don't like the posts fine neither do I however I think it's beneficial for the next person to be able to see how this customer was Un satisfied because I wish I had seen this before I spent 500 on parts that didn't last me over a month
Minus the esc and drive set 
I have nothing personally against him I just don't think he has good customer service

@Idobartal - We'll go ahead and cancel your order. Sorry for not seeing this any sooner.

Unfortunately, you'll have to wait for paypal now to refund your order.

Your always free to contact us on live chat for immediate assistance.

@willpark16 - Do you not remember? You were offered a complete new battery pack but you decided to not go through with it and do it yourself.

@mmaner - Thanks for the tag.

there was an answer, so as of now, everyone who has any problems with a vendor that is on the forum will make new threads with stuff "Every customer should know about{Vendor XY}" just because it works.

Congratulations, we officially closed the circle.

After talking to paypal all morning, its not so simple, i need wait for the vesc, pay for shipping back, wait for it to arrive, and wait for him to refund... a process which can take up to 45 days...
Im not afraid, i am bothered. This post is the only reason he replied... and what a weird reply saying he wished he saw it sooner... i uploaded a picture of his replies.

You uploaded pics of someones replies, not necessarily Dexters. You keep making these statemnets that are false, like how you titled your post that DIY was flagging your post, which was false.  Just chill, stop...you won.

Try the live chat on the site next time. He's always responded within minutes when I chat there. Including when I've asked for orders to be cancelled. 

But funny enough, "Ralph" did exactly the same thing to me. Said an order would be cancelled but I got a shipping notification this morning. Dex cancelled it without question so no skin off my back, but sounds like "Ralph" needs some work.

The issue is that you're calling out a fairly well respected member and distributor in the Esk8 community on your first post. Dexter runs a very small business and you can't expect the same level of service as Amazon. Mistakes happen and responses may take awhile.

Again...the lack of understanding that Dexter is not a big box store with racks of inventory and a staff on hand at all times.

@Idobartal doing things in esk8 and dealing with vendors is not like normal shopping.

This for the vendors is sometimes a one man show. So, sales person, customer service, billing, help desk etc...So, business practices are not as you would expect at times.  Yep, sometimes no answer for days. Crazy conformation emails. In stock notifications, but nothing sent.  It's a crazy way business is done. But one very important thing you need to remember. You need to be EXTRA patient when it comes to DIY. Things are less than perfect. But things usually sort them selfs out eventually on both sides.

Customer frustrated waiting for refund. A non-generalizabled thread is started to complain publicly. The vendor resolved the issue, which was likely what the eventual outcome would have been without the thread.
