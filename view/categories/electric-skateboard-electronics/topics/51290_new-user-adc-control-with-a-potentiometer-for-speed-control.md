Hey guys,
So I am new to VESC and I have been racking through all the whole forum but I can't seem to find a particular answer on how to do ADC control for a potentiometer. I know that I need to connect the pot to 3.3v, gnd and ADC but I don't know how to program it in the program. Any help or links to past forums would be greatly appreciated!! I am using a power supply of 25V, a 270v maytech sensored motor and a 500K potentiometer. Thanks!!

Iâ€™ve never tried, but maybe look on vedder.se forum.   For example,

There is a link in the last post to a set up video.
