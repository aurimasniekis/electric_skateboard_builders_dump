Guys anyone ever got LG HG2 from **GEARBEST** ? Are they legit ? 

Right now you can order **LG HG2** in packs of 4 for 19.16$ which gives you **4.76$ a piece**. Pretty crazy price. I am considering buying 36 cells for 12s3p.  Just wondering if they are not fake or something ?

I did some pretty extensive research on this site, and ultimately decided I didn't want to risk it. There are a number of very mixed experiences from them. fasttech is about the same, experience wise from what I've found.

I'm wondering the same thing, price seems just way too good! There are folks who sell used Panasonic batteries for 6-7$ a piece!..

So, if somebody founds a source where someone has already ordered and tested them, that would be invaluable!

I'm interested in these:

Still about 15 days (18days total) left.. So would be great to find out the truth sonner than that!

Why do you like these  Panasonics ? They have very low discharge rate .

I already got some other panasonic's available. I do agree it would be better to go with 20A discharge, like the samsung 25R offers..
