Hello, my motor is making a whining sound, it's the one on the left. It just started doing it, can I please get help? Not sure how this happened, something sounds loose inside.

Video is below:

Don't keep spinning it. Something inside or between the pulley and mount is rubbing. You can tell because it directly changes pitch with the motor speed.

Take it apart and clean it out. Pulley off first, motor off, circlip on the motor shaft off, then pull the can off.

Before you do that you might want to check if the bell itsself is loose on the motor shaft.

Cant get the damn motor off the mount, the screws are tight and I may have stripped one

Heat up the locktight, use a torch I used to use a heat gun but it didn't heat the metal fast enough to.be effective. Usually the motor screws come out easy with just a little heat.

If you're really eager a lighter could sometimes be used. A propane torch will burn cleaner though and you won't get much soot on it. Heatgun is the best option.

Just a culinary torch like this?

That would work but I use the larger mapp gas torch for speed, plus the the longer you take to heat it up the more time you give all the other metals to.absorb the heat so it's a PITA I just hit it with high heat for a short time. 

But yes the culinary torch should be good enough for the motor screws just do one at a time.

Sounds like broken magnet or bearing, had same sound

Cool so I went to Home Depit and already came back with one, heated em all up, really not sure how Iong I should though. Gonna try to unscrew now

All 4 off, but you're right. I didnt realize that heat transfers fast and I just heated up that motor to an astoundingly hot temperature...

Check if your magnets are still magnets, just put a screw or something on your motor can and see if it sticks

I guess it was <350 °C lol if it its your safe :D

Generally I try to keep the heat to a focal point and work one space at a time my motor usually doesn't get hot

That's normal the magnets are the only thing holding the motor together now, I would not use a screw driver it could mess up the magnets. 

You can try partially screwing the motor to the mount so that way you can pull the bell and hold on to the board for better grip.

Yea take a look at the magnets see if any are broken and look for scratch marks it's possible it was a.small rock that got in too

Take pics if you can, they are powerful magnets it's possible you got some metal that got sucked in while the motor ran, I'd clean it up best possible and slide the bell back on with out catching your fingers and try rotating to see if the sound went away.

Stick a single layer of normal tape all around the stator. Wherever it's rubbing you'll be able to see it marked up.

If you've got one marked up spot on the stator then there's some abnormality on the stator.

If there's a ring marked around the stator, then the Bell has something on the inside at that location.

Check your bearings as well.

Just put the tape around and connected it but nothing rubbing on the tape. Bearings seem fine, are they loctite in the motor?

Is there anything on the back of back of the stator? Checked both the front and the rear bearings?

Here's an admittedly possibly dumb idea... Try switching the two cans. If the other can (currently on the other motor) rubs on the busted motors stator, then you know the issue is with the stator or some other part there. If it doesn't rub, then you know the issue is with the can. Process of elimination 🤷‍♂️

EDIT: don't lose track of which one is which, you will want to put them back on their original motors.

The best thing you can do is tinker. Never stop trying to figure problems out and you will gain much deeper knowledge of how this stuff works.

That's on all the magnets, looks like rubbing marks but no actual like feeling I can feel on them or the stator

Have you managed to clean the magnets? Sometimes my motors accumulate so much debris that everything start to scrape 
Best thing I’ve found to remove the metal particles is high pressure water, the mains pressure is pretty high here so that works, you could try a pressure wash at distance to not damage the magnets

Have you check if the motor can is bend ? 

This could happen by tugging the board by the motors

Just pay the shipping 
And don’t pull the board by the motors :grimacing:
