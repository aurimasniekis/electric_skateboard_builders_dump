Does anyone know if other 2.4GHz receivers are compatible with the Mini Remote? I think I tried the GT2B's flysky receiver without any luck.

I'm pretty sure that They have their own communication protocol, so you can only use the mini remote receiver with the mini remote

Yeah that's what I thought. I know they have different AFHSS and FHSS back in the R/C days. Just wondering if anyone has it paired with other receivers that's all! Thanks!
