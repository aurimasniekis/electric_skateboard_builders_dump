I have a 12s 2 amp charger and the led is just blinking red fast. Any ideas?

also when i check voltage at output terminals, only 28v are coming out

I'd toss it in the bin

I'd sell it as - new, still in box, never used, never tested

I had the same when I changed the polarity. Small spark, half od voltage and nothing you van do.

What do u mean by reversing polarity.
The wires connected to my dc port are correct. I checked them.

Unless your comfortable opening it up and finding whats wrong (preferably powered off since theres 230V in there..), yes you'll need a new one

I conected the port wrong. I'm not saying that you did the same thing. Mine was blinking and I had half of the voltage and I bought new one and probably you'll have to do the same.

I did open the charger up and i don’t see any burn marks or anything

Also which side am I supposed to plug in the first? Should I plug the dc side in first or plug it into the wall first?
```

Just cause there wasn't a fire in it doesn't mean something isnt broken.
If u have a multimeter you can do some troubleshooting. Dont plug it in while you do it tho. 230VAC tickles the heart in a bad way. (had my hand in PC PSU once)

It shouldnt matter what you plug in first on a good charger.

Please be careful 110VAC can KILL you. If you don't know what you are doing please leave it and buy a new one...

Do you have any kind of training with electrical circuits?
If not please buy a new one...

Not officially but is there anyway to troubleshoot it without plugging it in

Meassure between + and - on primary and secondary side to see if theres a short. (Ohm)
Could also meassure the secondary sides voltage when turned on. (again, dont do this if you're unfamiliar with electrical appliances, and always have it plugged in to a fast breaking fuse)
```

Secondary sides voltage is 28v

Not really. You can do what @linsus said  but don't open it up and plug it in...

Yeah, on the other side of the cable sure. But what about the chain from transformer to output?

You really want him to measure that?
No offense @dg798 but electricity is hella dangerous if you don't know what you are doing.. especially mains..

I don't think he knows what he's doing and if he doesn't know where the mains side is he could get seriously injured :slight_smile:

I wouldn't trust any fuse.. it's you're last line of defense..

Lets hope we've nagged enough about safety. Fuse part is just to make people think, some countries still dont use  residual-current devices so current can run until the cables melt..

Mains side is what connects to the outlet

Listen to the guys here my friend.  Not much inside on of those things that are user repairable and cost wise its usually cheaper to discard and get a new one. If the indicator light is blinking rapidly then its a component issue not a wire fault so again probably not something you can repair cost effectively.
One thing to note too is sometimes when you unplug the charger from the mains the indicator lights stay on for a time.  Thats because the unit holds voltage so even unplugged you can get a belt.  Give it a while before you touch anything after its unplugged.  For future reference when you charge the board, plug the low voltage side in first ie the board then connect it to the mains.  This will stop the spark from the charge port.  It will even spark on the port if the outlet switch is off.  Be safe!!

While rcb are the safety standard for new installations there are still a lot of old residences that have not yet been ungraded so caution is a bloody good idea lol

Always good to have more than 1 charger at home that way you always have one available even if you left one at work or in the car. Also helps eliminating the charger as a problem if both chargers don't work that usually indicates it's a problem with your board. If only one works and the other doesn't then you have a defective charger.
