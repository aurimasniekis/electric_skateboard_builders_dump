I'm just wondering what belt type is this as I plan to design a new pully for my wheel as my wheel is only 60mm and I dont really want to buy new wheels for my board unless its a last resort.

The seller doesn't list belt type, pulley type or tooth number .. Most likely he or she doesn't know what they are selling. Better to look for someone else to buy from.

That's a 3m tooth profile. It'll work but you'll have mad belt slippage. Going 5m tooth profile will help eliminate belt slippage. You could always run am idler on 3m.

Further down on that listing, one image says it it is a 225 mm belt. But I agree with others on this post, you should probably buy something other than this kit.
