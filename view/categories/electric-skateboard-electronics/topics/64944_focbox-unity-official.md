**Who agrees that technology should get better, cheaper & faster over time?**

You won't find many people who disagree with that notion, the same should apply in the ESK8 Industry, It should be easier, faster & cheaper to build a better electric skateboard today than it was in 2014, but it isn't. I think its about time the DIY'ers of the ESK8 world get some new technology that can deliver on all these key points.

**EASIER**
10-year-old kids should be able to build a high-quality electric skateboard on Xmas morning & be riding before lunch. Making your own electric skateboard shouldn't take 3 months of research or expensive trial & error, but the truth is it's really still quite difficult to do it perfect first go. I can attest, even the pro's struggle making electric skateboards in a timely fashion. Imagine getting a lego technics kit for Xmas without the well-thought-out-step-by-step-simple instructions!

When building an electric skateboard getting each component put together in the correct way is a real challenge. But now comes the even harder part, loading USB drivers, finding the correct cable, trying to work out what firmware, what software version, what button to press... Congrats, all finished? nah, one motor is spinning the wrong way and you have no brake function, now what tab was that option on? 

**CHEAPER**
Thanks to a wave of Chinese entrepreneurs who are interested in electric skateboards and websites like aliexpress  there are now many more affordable options available, but unfortunately, many of these new low priced offerings are not necessarily universally compatible and the majority don't solve the first problem of being "easier" - They are simply cheaper, which is great! However, if your cheap gear can't be set up with simple user configurable options whilst also having widespread compatibility with other "cheap" gear whats the point of building DIY? Just buy a meepo

One of the main reasons I switched from Apple phones to Android phones where due to lower cost, higher spec, Android handsets. The real deal clincher that made the switch inevitable was that Android was more universally compatible & configurable, I had more control over how it functions & it cost less. 

**BETTER**
What is better? For me, it means more reliable, more performance, more robust, more useful features. Technology that you don't have to think about, a technology that you don't need to deeply understand for it to serve its primary function. Technology that just works out of the box. If the product works really well we can forget about it, we can spend less time building & more time riding.

Is the Switch a Momentary Switch or Latch? If the former is it programmable for say Auto Turn on/off and push to start? 

My final question being one of the "Unity features" is "in-built battery potection", how does this differ from the regular FOCBOXES ?

Good Job man

## \#6 Posted by: Deodand Posted at: 2018-08-15T15:16:27.270Z Reads: 1143

```
We decided to go for a high-side momentary switch. Short press for turn on, long press for turn off. The Unity then has control over when to turn itself off. This means we will be able to use a board push to turn-on and auto-turn off after long inactivity. Both these features will be fully configurable and easy to disable if not wanted. 

Battery protection is referring to a new feature of full under voltage lockout since the unit can fully shut down if voltage gets too low. We will also be publishing a simple method to allow your bms to over-ride your power switch and force shut down in the event of other battery health issues if desired.

Sorry for the novice question but would this mean that an antispark would not be needed then?

## \#8 Posted by: Deodand Posted at: 2018-08-15T15:22:17.369Z Reads: 1087

```
Correct, the inbuilt switch is anti-spark so all you'll need to add is a fuse for added safety. In theory the switching IC will force shutdown in the event of 230 amps current pull for more than 0.4 seconds but redundancy is always best for failure mechanisms.

Still working out where we want to go with the bluetooth firmware. It's an nrf52 module which gives us a lot of flexibility in application. I will keep encryption in mind!

Weird since: 

 > Exported goods are GST-free if they are exported from Australia within 60 days of the first of the following two events:
> 
>     the supplier receives any payment for the goods
>     the supplier issues an invoice for the goods.
> 
> If the goods are paid for by instalments, the payment or invoice referred to is for the final instalment.

"Shipping by weight" they say ha-ha, but maybe the FOCBOX Unity is really heavy? :) Shipping for wheels is AUD$39.

Covering lower pre-order price by increasing shipping costs?

This may be a silly question to some, but does the UNITY support a SINGLE motor configuration? My previous VESC fried, and I am considering a dual motor upgrade in the future. I was planning on getting the FOCBOX, but UNITY would be a cheaper option to future-proof that upgrade. Since the UNITY is designed to handle dual motors, perhaps it could handle just one motor even better?

I didn't plan to buy anytime soon but the final price with shipping and import fees (I saw evaluated to 330€ somewhere?) seems very disappointing. You can get 2 new focboxes for 300-320€ in europe and the unity was previously hinted as being a lot cheaper than 2 focboxes to produce.

Let's see if it gets better once it's distributed by the official affiliated resellers but this early bird deal doesnt sound so good.

Just enable China Post shipping and provide free postage for the group buys. The extra shipping time it will take will be overshadowed by the amount of time it normally takes enertion to ship products out anyway so its win win.

That's if it isn't already overpriced China Post already...

Well, I really wanted to be excited about this... and I was at first.  Pre-order pricing looks good and some of the new features are appealing, but retail price looks absurd based on what I had heard early on about this being signifcantly cheaper than buying 2 focboxes (assuming it's not like the R2 and is perpetually 'on sale') and shipping costs are very value prohibitive (the weight isn't included with the other dimensions listed, but I have a _real_ hard time believing it's nearly $40 to ship to US).  +Also, why is an xt-60 plug being used for power on something rated at 80a continuous per motor?  

Maybe I'll wait for Unity 2.1...

It wasn't a hint at all.  It was categorically stated that this would be cheaper to produce and so cheaper to buy than 2 focboxes on one of enertions videos and yet with everything included, shipping etc at the pre-sales price it is actually more expensive and it definitely does not cost 60 aud to ship from china.  Shipping has always been an issue with enertion and you'd think by now there would have been some improvement but alas....

Yes, your two options would be to either set the unity switch to always on, or you could bypass your bms switch fairly easily and let the diebiebms control the unity switch in event of battery health issue. We will provide some info closer to release on how the wiring works for this.

Not a silly question! It's like buying a motherboard with more RAM slots even though you don't have the money at the moment to use all of them. Yes it's definitely fine to use just 1 motor. Just make sure you properly secure and cover the other motor winding bullet connectors you aren't using with some tape.

Regardless of price or shipping suspicions, I would not place a pre-order until the source code is released. It’s important that the DIY community digs in to look at the details of this thing.

@nw-esk8 totally understand this reaction, but I'd like to offer a few counter-points and reasons everyone should be excited. Keep in mind value wise there are a couple things you aren't considering like the included anti-spark switch which would run you at least $20-$30 US plus shipping and the trouble of wiring (not to mention our switch won't fail on you and is under warranty). Additionally the unit comes with an integrated internal bluetooth module which would be something else you'd have to order third party and another added cost of $15-30 plus shipping. This included bluetooth module is an NR52, so it will be faster and more responsive than the standard HM10 modules most people sell. 

I think the final and biggest thing everyone should be excited about is that Enertion has made the leap into fully custom open-source vesc-based firmware to accompany their hardware. Part of what this price is reflecting is supporting me so I can focus on additional firmware features after launch. Most other companies are just taking Vedder's firmware, and uploading it to their hardware. While there's nothing wrong with this, it does mean there is generally a divide between the people coding firmware and the people making the hardware. This lack of understanding can lead to issues in hardware design or missed opportunities for awesome new features. For instance, one feature not listed above is the Unity hardware has a populated 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyro. Currently we have been too focused on getting to production to develop the extra features here, but I've got some exciting plans on how to use this additional incoming data. 

In developing the Unity, I had to gain a deep understanding of how the Vesc firmware is put together. Re-configuring the hardware timers  and ADC timings of the MCU to accurately control two motors synchronously wouldn't have been possible otherwise. This combined with @Blasto's experiences with the original FOCBOX means we have a good breadth of understanding of how the hardware and firmware of vesc-based designs can be improved. 

Every aspect of the unity has been agonized over for an absurd amount of time. When you complain about the XT60 connector you should know it's something we've already thought about in depth, here's a video of an XT60 handling 180 amps for 10 seconds: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEdysiZAYZ4

This connector will easily support 80 amps continuously while only getting slightly warm. The stated 160 amps rating for the Unity is 160 total motor amps continuous and we don't recommend using over 100 battery amps or your unity. For an eskate, 100  amps at 40V is 4 kW! This should be plenty of power for the majority of people. 

Anyways we can't make everyone happy obviously, but I do hope everyone can believe we didn't just slap a bunch of components together and a price tag and say "here ya go!". This thing is our baby and I'm super excited for everyone to get their hands on them and experience the improvements! Please keep the feedback coming though, love to hear everyone's thoughts!

Is there such a thing as safe shutdown? So instead of just shutting down, unity would just disable acceleration  apply .5A braking and slowly come to a stop? I don't like the idea of any ESC shutting down on me for any reason whatsoever.

As long as the reason for shutdown is non-critical than this is totally feasible. For instance the Vedders firmware already continues to allow braking even after your battery dies and it no longer allows acceleration.  Many of the soft faults are this way, stopping acceleration current but allowing braking current. Unfortunatley some failure modes mean the motor controller is unable to continue working correctly so only option is shutdown.

CE
[/quote]

Support has told me the Unity will be CE certified for the EU, can this be confirmed.
Also in my opinion the base price is not an issue, it is the low ball tactic of throwing on between 40-50AUD for "shipping" for each unit.

To screw with it even more the shipping difference between USA and EU is a double scam.

One unit shipped to the US and to Germany are both $51AUD.
Change that number to 21 units and the shipping to the US becomes $490AUD but the shipping for EU becomes $800AUD!

That equals €510 extra just for shipping.

People are excited over this product, otherwise they could care less about shipping etcetera. Even if there's a valid explanation for the difference in shipping costs for EU and US, for the avg customer, it looks weird, and this would be the forum to ask questions, no? 

@Deodand was handling the questions pretty good, so if these questions are that upsetting, maybe take a short break  from the forum and enjoy the sun for a few minutes.

Yea you are right,  I have never looked at international shipping from China other than what I get when I buy things on AliExpress.
So I had to try and find some online quotes from shipping companies to see the difference.
So far the only company that I found that I know the name of and had online quotes without having an account was TNT.

I don't know the weight of a Unity so I just made a generous guess that 21 units would weight no more than 10kg. that's about 475g for each unit with protection.
I also made an assumption that they would fit in a 30 x 30 x 30cm box once padded with bubble wrap.

Chine to USA Express = 292€ 
Pretty close to the 312€ that the website quotes.  I would even say spot on once you take packaging material and labor into consideration.

![china%20to%20USA%20TNT|450x500](upload://kCdOMDZCXPlzaGyEQ32KfYEc49X.PNG)

China to Germany Express = 286€
Have I done something wrong? I have looked at a quote like you suggested and I am getting a lower price than shipping to the USA, and a much lower price than is being charged on your website.

![TNT%20China%20to%20EU%20shipping|420x500](upload://m0s66Kmg3nSp6ECAOPJvJ85YFNT.PNG)

This was just the first and only site I have looked at.  I am not china exporting expert but I am sure there are other options out there the offer just as good and even better prices for your customers that are waiting to support you.

:rofl::smile: ok. I know you did take a break from the forum and I believe most of us actually enjoy when you get on here every once in a while. 

But when things look weird and won't add up, questions or "bitching" as you'd call it, is what one would expect. I know you've been talking a lot about transparency, which I bleieve is a good thing, and that must come from the fact that many of your customers care about what they buy, want to be well informed and want to make good decisions. 

So us asking questions and you giving answers without telling people you'll flag their posts (lol), is part of being transparent and giving good customer sevice imo. 

I wouldn't doubt for a sec that you have insane shipping costs and that you have to charge for that as well. Everyone's fine with that as long as they understand = as long as you answer/ explain.

so I went to bed immediately after placing a pre-order of a single unit, feeling relatively pleased with myself, and accepting of a one off shipping charge that if truth be told wasn't that unreasonable.

Then I wake up, check this thread and woah.... what a shit show from Enertion. Very bad business practice to come on here and spout at potential customers who've done nothing more than highlight a blatant flaw (at best) in the shipping rates for multiple units.

I run a business that ships via DHL around the world. I know for an absolute fact what it costs to reach the far flung corners of the globe, and I also know that it doesn't cost $800 to ship 20 or so mobile phone sized and weighted items anywhere, unless you're paying for a slot on SPACE-X cargo bay.

Change your shipping rules to combine shipping to a reasonable and respectable rate, but moreover, and I cannot stress this enough, change your tone Jason. It's not very becoming from a business owner. I'll assume that beer and aussie sun got to your head during the product launch, but I sincerely hope you have a moment of contrition this morning when re-reading your posts from earlier.

All that being said, I'm looking forward to receiving my single unit, and hope it's all that it's cracked up to be.

It's a shame as it puts you off the company as a whole and yeah now, whilst the industry is in it's infancy, it doesn't seem to matter, but in the long term - something all businesses should be looking to in my opinion - it just damaging for the brand.

I don't expect a change anytime soon, but ultimately it will affect my decisions in the future as other brands emerge and mature (maturing being something Enertion's PR department needs to do sooner rather than later).

That picture you painted about his staff restaining him whilst he tries to get to his computer is funny as :joy: 

Anyway, none of his vitriol was directed at me, and I only bought one unit with regular shipping which was OK. If I'd wanted more, I'd have looked to alternative methods such as a group buy etc.

This is the worst part about all of it, this is clearly an amazing product. 

I'm a firm believer in getting products to market though. Enertion stopped being a little niche supplier a while ago. If you guys want to launch a new product I feel like it should be bulk shipped with "shit" 45 day shipping to my country and then sold to me. I didn't choose for the product to be manufactured on the other side of the world, why am I covering inflated logistics costs for you? Bake cheap shipping in to the product price, get it here and then sell it to me when it's ready.

I'm no commercial shipping expert. But clearly a lot of people find the shipping prices an issue. I can understand the single units. 
But the larger orders should not be as expensive as they are for EU.  Packing 21 units into a single box is less work and faster than packing 1 unity into 21 boxes.

I just think that with this much uproar it would be a good idea to look into providing a better shipping experience for your potential future customers.

The end user of this product, and the main purchasers of this is an individual DIY user.  That's who it's marketed to.  I really don't see the logic in calling the main customer base 'trolls' for voicing something obvious, but then saying you'll offer some super special deal for those who are going to use this purely for a business purpose.  So the only way you get reasonable shipping is if you want to go into business with Enertion, which obviously is fine, but basically the ones who are going to end up using this are the ones footing that bill either way.

I understand where you are coming from it is a niche market but stating it is going to be competitively priced  and stating one price and then increasing it and siting the exchange rate as the reason but then the exchange rate doesn't support the explanation given then that is hiding the true reason if they came out and said we saw the interest and realized we could make some serious money I was say ok dick move but I respect the honesty.

My only reference to Amazon was about the shipping speed.  You know just like most other people when it comes to shipping that is were Enertion has fallen short on multiple occasions. Namely the Black Friday swindle where everyone though they had the units but then hadn't even started producing them and I know they went in and fired the whole staff that was on the focbox production. But the shipping issue is that if your paying for the faster shipping what is the expected date to have the items in hand.  And do they have them already produced.  I know there are prototypes out there as we have seen the beauty that @JLabs had posted. 

Also with 50 unit there should be some sort of leverage that we would have because at 199 the price is $9,950 at $209 the price is $10,450

I dig that Enertion has had its issues with shipping, but in all fairness this is an issue that every company that mass produces anything has most of the time.  When it comes to elaborate manufacturing such as electronics, it's only worse.

I'm not saying give @onloop a pass, Im just saying have some understanding.  Enertion has had issues with shipping in the past and likely will again, it's just part of the game. He will have to own those issues and figure out a way past them, if he does that I think everything is good.  If he doesn't, then we just have to wait.  For my money, the FocBox is still the best ESC available and that includes the VESC6 and every VESC6 clone I've personally used.  So I'm happy to wait.

I don’t think this is in regard to people expecting these things in any timely fashion after all anyone who thinks were *really* getting the Unity in November with no delays is the King of Wishful Thinking. 

It’s more so that the shipping / price increase looks skeptical ( at this point I don’t even care anymore) , when Jason spouts one thing and others come with a rebuttal. And it’s not helping when Jason claims that any comments of criticism is trolling. Trolling involves malice or at the very least the intent to disrupt when not a single comment on this thread is such. They’re Critisisms and valid ones at that.

It's like this.  Shipping times are going to be long, get used to it or stay angry, but know your anger doesn't hurt anyone but yourself.  These criticisms are minor, dont have anything to do with production and shipping, which is the issue that everyone seems to be having.  I agree the pricing increase was odd, but I dont think its skeptical.  Frankly, with all the criticisms going Jasons way, Id likely give a smartass answer too.  Try to see all the crap that's getting flung at Jason EVERY TIME he releases a product.

@mmaner 

Stop waisting your time, it seem like people don't really see the market behind the Unity, which is mainly the reseller and wholesale. 

Think about it for the FOCBOX small and big reseller where having a profit around 10% which is kinda bad, but you know the FOCBOX was marketed for individual  sale and there wasn't much profit to be made for the reseller. 

But the Unity is marketed as a reseller product, so it will probably cheaper to buy from reseller across the glode than directly from Enertion (and I don't blame them for this, because handling individual is time and money consuming). Also, I should help those resellers to get a bigger part of the cake (probably 20-25% profit, which is more what a reseller should get) help them grow, which if far more beneficial for the community than lower shipping price for each individual.

I disagree. it’s not something I’m pulling out of my ass here , nor is intended to be an attack on Enertion. It’s a Statement based on Enertions history of shipping and delays on a number of their flagship products. 

Now mind you I’m not soley blaming Enertion as I can imagine working with Manufacutres who don’t adhere to your specific instructions or running out of supply for a needed Material would throw a rench in *any* preset deadline, but the reality here , as it was during Black Friday and as it is with the Raptor 2 , is that any important product from Enertion that receives a ludicrous amount of orders is subject to not be delivered on time , one way or the other. 

This isn’t meant to be malicious, nor trolling , nor anything related of the sort, but *an observation that as of the last year , has shown to be more true than false*.

And if statements drawn from observations are malicious than fuck me and call me a walking casket cause I don’t mean it that way.

I agree with what you and @mmaner have said if Enertion came out and said we are introducing the focbox unity we are no longer doing individual sales only to certified resellers that would be great because then you would have the community contacting resellers in there country or close to it and getting better prices as it would create a competitive market for the resellers to fight in thus driving the price lower while they could still make a profit.  I have no problem with a reseller wanting to make a profit if it part is geared towards that.  

The biggest problem that I have is that they published the price at $199 and then they change the price to $10 more after seeing the interest in the group buys soar with the USA one they are seeing an added $500 profit for those 50 pieces which in Australian dollars that comes out to $689.29 profit. Then he give a bogus excuse about exchange rate being the cause but then the exchange rate does not support what you are saying then I call bullshit.  When it comes down to it one man band or not don't state something then use an excuse that you don't have the numbers to back you up because then you end up looking like a dicknose.

@Deodand , Hey, very excited for your new design and I just ordered one. I just watched your "Blacks Beach FOCBOX Unity Hill Test" youtube video. I'm not 100% across the history of VESC and the firmware/app design so forgive me if this question is already answered elsewhere.

I notice that the battery percentage readout on your app seems to be based solely on battery voltage. Ie it sags very low when battery current is high. Given that the VESC/FOCBOX/UNITY know the battery current, is there a way to make battery % be based on capacity remaining? Obviously you would need to tell the UNITY or App what your battery capacity is and it would need to keep track of when it has been fully charged.

I'm also an EE, in my designs we normally call this kind of thing a fuel gauge and coulomb counter/meter is also used. On most of my battery powered devices there is a dedicated chip keeping track of it via a sense resistor. I think you can do it fairly well with just the battery current information you already have. The dedicated chips sometimes do compensation using battery voltage also, but even a simple approach is better than using battery voltage directly.

It's a source of great frustration that boards like the Evolve use battery voltage as a proxy for % full on their fancy remotes.

Maybe people will do 4 seperate orders if they want larger qty with cheaper shipping.

The bulk prices are to entice serious business operators to start a discussion.

And that is all you had to say.  
It's funny how you chose the other company that charges the earth to ship though lol
Oh and Maytech are negotiable on shipping bulk too btw.
Look at the US companies that offer free shipping to the states at anything over $300.  This sort of thing will endear you to the lesser markets such as home.

Pulling this from back before the shipping drama.... But do you know what you will be marketing this as? Will I be able to skip the waterproof enclosure on this and mount it outside of the deck? Or will I still need to keep this inside which negates the nice heatsink design.

This stuff will be a second line of defense against water encrosion. Definitely still want to keep this thing safe in an enclosure. Main issue here is regarding connectors. Would have to use heavy duty automotive connectors for an external design and it would drive the size and the cost much higher.

I know this is kind of off topic but everyone is talking about shipping charges

Let me answer it in two ways (if necessary)

**First as Enertion representative** 

As per the last 5 months history of shipping items from China to all over the world
We have chosen many shipping companies/courier services like 
4px, DPD, SF Express, Local post which charges low shipping but there is no definitive or estimated delivery date on it also some of the orders have taken more than a month to get completed.

People starts to complain about it even though they agreed to the situation earlier which is quite unsettling.

That's why we decided to only use express shipping lines to eradicate that wait and non-definitive delivery ETA issue. 
The preferred courier is DHL, FedEx and UPS express services.
I know it's little off if you guys have to pay expensive shipping charges but we can do something about it if you contact Enertion support before placing the order.
Via Live Chat or Support Email
(Specially for Bulk Shipments or group buy orders)

**My Individual opinion and comparison**

I have ordered many items internationally and I personally face different shipping quotes with different shipping companies like Singapore post, China post, 4PX, FedEx, SF Express, UN-Line, AUSPost, UPS, USPS etc

and the shipping was nearly close to Enertion's quoted ones.
So If I have to order Unity I will be less concerned about shipping charges.

I think it is better to get Unity shipped using DHL express as it's secure, and have definitive timeline for me.

Let me know if you guys have any questions
```

Guys if you are so angry about shipping costs just wait to receive the 11% code by mail and it will reduce the cost of one unit to 260 $ ( 220 €) and it's an amazing price IMO. You won't find anything like it elswhere, it's an amazing piece of technology, not like the dual flipsky.

DPD is not available in China... It's Euro shipping company...

Also then you guys use UPS,  DHL, Fedex and etc, the cost of paying after receiving item is freaking huge especially in Europe, for e.g. I bought simple single FocBox it was shipped with DHL... I had to pay 50£ for customs agent fee (20£) custom fees + vat fees. So these express shipping fees appearing after receiving product on top of 30$ shipping is huge.. almost a separate focbox...

Using those express shipping it's pretty easy for companies as you just ship and forget because of 100% delivery, but for simple people it's pretty expensive, I should suggest too look up how for e.g. Digikey using UPS and sent from USA able to skip custom fees and etc.

What I don’t understand is that Enertion has zero stock in Australia. Back in the days when the whole garage thing was going on, shipping was a negligible amount. I rather buy  Enertion stuff from overseas and let them ship to Australia which is still cheaper than purchasing directly from Enertion ....

Shipping on one unit (as I found out when I ordered mine) is reasonable. It's P&P not just the cost of the DHL service I accept.

Think it was more than fair though to call out a certain Enertion person for the aggressive and wholy unprofessional manner in which the (legitimate in my eyes) complaints about the multiple unit costs were dealt with. Allowing these to just spiral out of control unchecked looks like profiteering. Defending that clear error in the manner in which it was appeared childish at best, and downright obnoxious at worst.

I'm still happy the Unity is imminent in 2018, and look forward to building an all new board with it at it's heart. Easy to forget Enertion are not a big company with their pro-looking website and CGI graphics. It's a cottage industry with a smal but global customer base, though I'm hapy it exists and is develoing new stuff for us all to use.

I don't understand what you are talking about DPD 
Because we have shipped many Raptor 2s in 2017 and early 2018 using DPD from China to Europe.
There are many examples.

I am aware what you are trying to explain but for Europe it's always a tough time for every shipping company due to changes occurred in May 2018 in their custom rules.
We are always working on the ways to avoid custom charges but we are not able to promise that customer will not face any.

All we can do is provide the necessary documents (required to clear custom) and hope that there will be no custom charges on the shipment.
So shipping is almost same for companies or for an individual.

In the end, we always keep exploring the channels, So there is a hope we will find some solution about the custom related situation and a better shipping channel in future :slight_smile:

Start a discussion there are group buys going on and they are looking at doing 100 units and the best you can do is the same 209 for 21 units doesn’t seem like there is much room for discussion no matter the size of the order. I still think it was a bad move to up the price $10 and then blame exchange rates when the facts don’t back up your reason. Just be straight dude about seeing the big profit of raising it $10.

For the EU group buy, it went from just under 20 people showing interest in the first day the thread was posted.  The day the Unity was announced and before the Unity pre orders opened. Then once the price was increased €10 plus the shipping cost revealed almost everyone lost interest.
So maybe someone else will find this interesting too.

This is for Germany.
![EU%20unity%20shipping%20scam|690x358](upload://r6Dhb3siUcBB1yZdWGFZXIMsMSH.PNG)

Unless you get 21+ units the savings from the group buy are negated by the added on cost of the shipping. 
between 10-20 units you save $28AUD per unit, but you are paying between $40 and $49.9AUD per unit in shipping.
For the EU the best price point is getting 3 other people and going in on 4 units together, unless you can get 21+ people.
And this chart is without adding on VAT and import duties.

This is the same chart with US shipping for a comparison.

Guys just food for thought but Enertion is a business and in place to make a profit.  I know this may be getting looked over by many complaining.   No one is putting a gun to your head and saying order or else.  There is so much complaining about paying for the shipping.  You have the ability to buy or not to buy wasting peoples time complaining in the this thread is completely useless to people trying to make an informed decision.   BTW I'm not affiliated with Enertion in any way.  Actually this will be my first purchase from Enertion.

I could not order as Enertion will not ship to my region - western Norway. I got an explanation from Enertion and they have had bad and expensive experiences shipping around in Norway. They only ship to places around the capital (approx). I understand that there is no business case if it gets too expensive. However I also checked the sum of VAT and toll taxes which was as expected. I know the rules in Norway, and there are no «funny business». The cost of shipping should be about the same in greater parts of Norway, and the VAT and toll taxes are equal for all of Norway. I live in the second largest city in Norway (yes I know it is still small from a global perspective). It seems they’ve got bad shipping deals as I have always been able to order from other stores around the world. Even to really rural addresses in Norway. I wish Enertion could «unlock» shipping to all of Norway. But I guess the deal is off anyways. I hope Unik or some other European distributor are going to sell these at an ok price. The product looks really exciting!

Little 0603 SMD fuse. Possible to swap with a 0 ohm resistor if you have some soldering skill and want to live dangerously.  150mA at 40V is 6 Watts though so should drive most things. 

A word of warning we moved the Servo 2 output to a 2mm spaced rectangular header. We are developing a new remote and its reciever will have a nice home within the Unity case. You will still be able to access the PPM2 input/output if you needed it but the connector won't be the same as pictured here.

Summary: PPM1 connector will be as pictured PPM2 won't.

Servo connector is 0.1" JST XH connector. All others are 2mm JST PH connectors.

Bullets are 3.5mm bullet connectors like current focbox and power in is an xt 60 connector. 

Personally I recommend picking up some mt60's which mate nicely with the phase lead bullet connectors and help prevent shorted phase leads. Would be great to include all the breakout connectors but not everyone needs them and you've seen how angry everyone gets over increased price :slightly_smiling_face:

Typically I just use the one with male pins on the motor side, then stick it down with some double sided tape close to the Unity to ensure nothing pulls loose.

My guess -- the whole mgmt team is in China busy with R2 production.

They gave most of the R2 buyers a $200AUD credit to compensate for the delays, so I'm guessing much of that went toward Unity. I'm guessing they did good with pre-order numbers. Jason said as much in one of those video updates.

There is no such thing.  The VESC project is GPL free software ***which means you already own it***, along with every other human.  If they change it, legally they must also release their changed source code because *you, along with every other human, are also the legal owner of it.*

Yeah it should be doable. Main thing is the speed PID controller will need to be dialed in well. The mellow boards endless ride feature is actually easy to implement since it is designed for a specific system. Since the unity will need to work for an arbitrary board it will be a bit tricky. Have taken a lot of classes in system identification so I was imagining I could maybe have a routine where I have the rider go for a quick test ride in normal mode on relatively flat terrain. Then I record the input output data in the app and use this to characterize the system. From there it would select an appropriate/efficiemt speed controller for the endless ride feature. 

Have some priorities that come before this but it is something that sounds super fun/interesting to me so expect to see it in the next few months.

Isn't speed control already implemented in the vesc software? Endless mode should in theory be much easier to implement given that any vesc can already run a (pretty accurate might I add) speed control pid. That along with your included gyroscope should let it easily differentiate between a foot braking (higher current draw, but no change in slope) and understand when the board is going downhill. I don't see why it would have to have additional specialization when the vesc software already gets tuned to the motor and thats all it currently needs for an accurate pid.

It isn't about implementing speed control, it's about implementing speed control without overshoot :slight_smile:. Picking good PID values is something lots of people get paid lots of money to do. I might be overthinking it but I have a feeling picking standard PID values and trying to apply them to all boards will result in some really bad phenomenon with the interplay in endless ride mode. Will be important to have an overdamped or critically damped system. Essentially if the board tries to hold a speed goes slow then over compensates I can see instability being the result, since as it overshoots it will then try and hold the speed it overshot to. Won't have the desired feel at all.

I was talking about synthetic load not riding... The better synthetic load handling less problems while you ride ;) For e.g. I am riding with 90A focbox which by itself will never hold that much current, but with our case and careful testing in the summer I'm running it under 50ºC and as many other people who uses our cases and heatsink plates can tell the same story, the better synthetic load results less headache you will have in summer...

Would you use an elevator that can handle up to 80kg ( before cable torns ) and you are 70kg?
I wouldn't. What if something unexpected happens? What if you ate a bit more that day?

Would you live in a house that has walls that can hold exactly the weight you currently have in your house and not a single gram more? What if the wall gets just a little bit damaged? It wouldn't be able to support the floor anymore and would collapse.

There is always a safety margin built into things all around you, everywhere.

Besides increasing general safety, it also increases reliability and lifespan of the product which saves money in the long term. And it is beneficial for the manufacturer as well - less RMAs, better reputation etc.

I was going to buy one anyways so I have no misgivings about getting one in that 4 day initial period. The initial $10 bump to the price on bulk units the first day was a minor slap to the face. The shipping however I think was just an oversight from them not remembering they can pack units together for large orders. They probably forgot to check the calculated price on a large order before the sale went live. Either way, money talks and I wanted one, so I got one :slightly_smiling_face:

It's not the shipping, not the 4 day never ending sale nor @onloop 's attitude. Enertion just over stressed how much cheaper the Unity will be to produce and implement! I was really hoping for something in between the 80US$  Meepo, Wowgo, Ownboard margin and the 300US$ dual Focbox. But nearly 300$ if you include the shipping just feels like the cost advantage isn't passed on to the customer.
I think this whole e-skate thing need a mid margin contender who is selling decent stuff for a good price point. My hopes in @onloop where high, maybe too high.

Whilst I am very excited to receive my unity and im very impressed with the specs, i do think that the "Launch" has been a shitty experience, especially for the early adopters.

As an earley adopter i was lead to believe that we were getting some special deal for buying early and that it was at the cheapest price possible. 

Firstly the price kept changing during the ordering process, was only really sure of the cost when i had finished checking out. but whatever, despite shipping costs it seems reasonable price for new hardware with so many features.

Then 20 mins later Enertion email me a 12% discount code for the product i just brought. They wont allow me to cancel and reorder and they wont refund me the difference. Why the fuck you email me a code that you wont allow me to use, after i already purchased the product? what purpose does that serve other than pissing people off? they say they can only offer me in store credit refund, i will never use it but i guess its better than nothing.

Then this morning they email me saying its now on offer with free shipping. fucking great, i already ordered and payed shipping. you've already had me money. i already know your not willing to give me any back. what am i supposed to do with this?

This is why enertion grew so fast for a one man shop with no capital and minimal funding. Afaik Jason doesn’t take a big cut of the profits and instead invests them back into the business and expanding the company. I would say this is the only good management decision he’s made because everything else from marketing to pricing of his products and the production of raptor 2s have been shitty all the way. He spends time reading on how to grow his business but doesnt learn how to sell his products properly. have you seen the website? Everything is bold with !!! After every sentence and makes use of 90’s clickbait marketing jargon. His products have so much potential but it’s being held back by himself. Wouldn’t say he’s the only one who’s been left behind though trampa is equally as guilty and maybe even more since their website is filled with so much self praise that even just navigating the site is a pain in the ass but at least their prices don’t change from day to day...

@onloop should really use some of the profits to hire someone who’s only good at marketing like Jeremy from jedboards...

I had the chance to do a short temperature test with the beta version of the Focbox UNITY. For the test the MOSFET temperature cutoff start was set to 85 °C and I run the FOC open loop command with 80A motor current for both connected SK3 6374 motors to see how long the Unity could handle that high current before it reaches max MOSFET temperature and reduce the motor current.
Thanks to @rpasichnyk we have a first Metr App and Metr Pro beta version that talks to the Focbox UNITY.

![MetrPro_FocboxUNITY|281x500](upload://9tSSrsZPSDVqIaBiU8sCF065ko7.jpg)

The results from the Unity temperature test you can see here:
https://metr.at/r/zez12

The motor current displayed in the graph is the motor current of both motors together. As you can see the Focbox Unity was able to deliver a total of 80A per motor for around 90 seconds. Very impressive for such a small design. :smiley: After that the MOSFET temperature limit of 85 °C was near to getting reached and the Unity starts to decrease its motor current output. The motors were pulling the max possible motor current throughput for around 8 minutes ending in around 40A each. After that the open loop command was stopped and you can see the temperature falling for another 2 minutes before the recording was ended. The test was done in room temperature with the Unity laying on the desk. There was no airflow for better cooling available, just the Unity in the beta version of the aluminum case.
Definitely props to @Deodand for that accomplishment. :sunglasses: Hitting the temperature limit with electric skateboards in the real world will be hard I guess.
Hope you guys can obtain some useful information from that test.

Long story short, in order to release an ios app on the app store, you need to own the code yourself. No one truly owns the VESC Tool code due to the license, so Enertion will have to make another one from the ground up. 

They *could* release it as an unofficial ios app, but those get annoying sometimes.

Vias that are inside SMD pads (via-in-pad) are often plugged with epoxy or solder to avoid wicking too much solder from the surface of the board during reflow. It's less of a problem on these large pads, but still something that has to be considered.

yeah, was definitely on my list of concerns when I designed the board. So far all of our samples have come back reflowed correctly, The solder mask has quite a large opening so it doesn't seem to be a problem. The test jig performs a thermal test which watches the rate of temp rise during a high current test so we should catch any poorly soldered fets pretty easily.

Sorry if this is a noob question, but it is specific to the Unity.

How would one go about wiring a battery meter to the unity if using the included switch? Specifically, could you wire it so it turns off and on with the unity?

Is that what the AUX port is for?

We will ship pre-orders as soon as they are ready. It's possible right now they are ready before November, but most likely sometime during November is the ship date. It is hard for me to imagine a scenario where the unity isn't ready to ship before 2019.  The BOM for 1k units is already on order and the PCBs will be ordered as soon as we complete testing for production test units. The unity isn't a full Eskate build it's just a PCB with a case, so it's much less complicated than the Raptor 2 logistically because there's simply less pieces/challenges to consider. Don't expect Raptor 2 level delays, but there's always a small chance some detail trips us up for a few weeks. Once production sample testing is completed (2 weeks from now) we can provide a more accurate estimate. I'll continue posting updates as they come :slight_smile:

If you go carvon then I recommend you go 4wd. Not much torque with 2wd when accelerating from stand still but speed there is plenty of. 

When you do get going there is torque.

Hi @Deodand.
Yesterday one question appeared here in the forum. One guy called the enertion CS and asked if the unity will replace a bms as it’s promoted as build in battery protection.
The CS said clearly, with the unity there is no need for a bms anymore.
🤔 did I just overseen the ports for the balance wires on the unity or was it a wrong statement from the CS?
As for my understanding there is a difference between battery protection and battery management system.

Ok that is pretty cool. So the e-switch allows this function. I did have one battery lose a few cells because I left my board on once, so this may have saved my battery. :+1: Its a sort of negligence protection. Haha. 

Maybe it could just shut off after 4 hrs if you didn't put in any inputs to not let the battery get dangerously low? Some people think auto off is a potential safety issue though.

Yes the switch will be a white light. We figured a neutral color would be best for matching all builds. It isn't hard to wire up your own momentary switch to be compatible either, and the pinout also has support for bi-color LEDs though I still need to code that functionality. @Hummie the switch is momentary, the microcontroller handles the latching-on functionality for the board. We will make a demo video once the production samples arrive demoing it.

The price is competitive against any other equally specced vesc-based design out there, and it reflects the large R/D costs we have put in to make a reliable product, and the ongoing cost we will continue to furnish to further improve the software/user experience.

We may offer a lower power/cost/footprint variant that may hit around that price-point sometime in the future to accommodate smaller builds or 4WD builds where 70 amps per motor would be a bit much, but that is a ways off.

Then it would become "way longer than it needs to be"? The wires are silicone and bend readily. The net width of the Unity with bent wires is somewhere between 13 and 14cm which is going to match the width of two 18650s stacked end to end and wrapped pretty dead dead on. You could reflow the solder pads where the power connector comes in and rotate them to get closer to a right angle if space was really tight for some reason. 

@nuttyjeff I'm assuming you mean the one in the top of the picture? There's LEDs in there placed symmetric to the USB C, was supposed to be a thin semi/transparent silicone film over them but I think the factory tore it off thinking it was an artifact of molding process. The color isn't correct either.

It just seems like an oversite. Why bend wires if we don’t need to? 

Not too many of us are running our battery packs off the right side of our boards. On any deck there is more length than width to work with.

That strongly implies that it would void warranty and that you could check.
But you may let it slide most of the time but then that means you could discriminate some users and not extend the same curtsy.

I have to agree with @Eboostin I think the battery leads should be going out the back as a majority of people have longer enclosures instead of wider. Are the connectors xt60 or xt90? Because those connectors with 10awg wires would definitely push that total width out wider then the 14cm. Since it seems basically impossible to move those solder pads without a major delay maybe enertion should put a bend in the wires at the factory to eliminate the end uses needing to void a warranty to make the unit work for them. Plus I think the plastic pieces could easily be 3D printed to drop the price of the unity slightly.

3d printing is only cheaper in quantities under something like 100 or less depending on mould complexity. It is most helpful on forums like this to give advice in departments which you are experienced, and ask questions in fields which you are not. I already said the width is about 14cm, I have the unit sitting on my desk right now. I don't just make up numbers. The case is 118 mm, the wire bend extends maybe another 15mm. 

![20181001_215012|690x388](upload://hsT2q2a5B3Hvw32ZaDfm1qkdSve.jpeg) 

The silicone case is one of the cheapest components on the unity. Most of the budget is going to the BOM for the pcb.

In the original pictures that had posted it the wires for the battery coming out the side looked that they were not as flexible as they seem to be after seeing your pictures I see they are flexible.  What gauge wires is the battery leads.  I also didnt appreciate the fact that you told someone to basically void the warranty and modify the unit by reflowing the solder pads to where the power connectors comes in and rotate.  I understand it is just a suggestion but he was discussing the wires coming out the side as constructive criticism.  The focbox had the power connector coming out the box and the motor leads coming out the front and that works great for the applications it is being used in.  Why it would be changed on the unity I dont know unless it is because of the connector ports take up the whole back.  Also in your picture is that a CAN cable on the far right connector?

This is how I intended it to be used. If you open a raptor 2 you'd see how nice the layout is. Power delivery at that location in the board allows for the most direct delivery to all the fets while still maintaining a single power delivery connector. If you had spent the hundreds of hours I have designing/redesigning the layout of the board and debating different configurations/ layouts you might understand how tired I am of thinking about a problem that isn't actually a problem and doesn't need to be solved. 

I'm not angry :smiley:, just am a bit bored at work waiting for software to compile, thought a bit of silliness on the forum might help relieve boredom.

No offense intended, I'm sure you put a ton of hour into this. Clearly you noticed it as a potential inconvenience too if you spent as much time as you say rearranging. My intent was not to have you halt production and start from square one but if there was a way to mitigate as much of the bend as possible when assembling, that would be awesome as the less stress on components the better. 

I'm looking forward to more updates on the Unity. I will probably be purchasing one for my Raptor 1.

My thing was that the solder pads could have been moved before the production runs they could have gone where the hole on the left side of the board since the pads are on the bottom side of the board. My main concern would be the stress on those joints and wires. As you can see from your comparison the super flexible wires from the remote lines are able to make that sharp bend with out issue as they are smaller gauge the wires going to the xt60 are a lot thicker and bring the issues of not being able to make a true hard right angle. Looking at it I am not sure you would be able to do a two enclosure type build with this

I don’t think it’s wasted energy at all. Wasted energy would be continually requesting they offer it in pink when they only offer black. 

No one is disputing the size, we’ve seen comparison pics. We are making suggestions that I think every builder on here would benefit from. Everyone will be bending their wires so if’s telling the assembly line to clock them 45 degrees out rather than straight out, we would all be happier. Maybe we’ll see it on Unity 1.1

*Sigh* I wish. The code is in a workable state right now but needs a bit of love. Still a few hacked bits that work well but dont follow good coding practice so need to re-arrange a bit. Currently all my focus is on test jig SW dev to test as many independent features as we can. Finally got Qt to compile on a rPi yesterday :smile: was way harder than I expected. 

When units arrive (Friday) I'm working to implement/test all the smart switch features both on the FW side and App side. Ideally in tandem with this I'll be implementing some of the features/addressing some of the issues that beta testers identified. A few of these:

*Automatic hall sensor swap (if you accidently plug your hall sensors in backwards m1 hall with m2 phase leads the FW identifies during calibration and switches them software side)
*Torque curves/more thorough remote calibration settings
*Data logging (this ones for the datasheet we are about 30% done making which includes plots of current/temp/time to better address the "continuous current" misnomer)

We have a stand-in FW that will be flashed to the MCUs now before pcb assembly. Then the test jig will flash latest FW image before shipment so we have all the fixes in there. There won't be much use for the code without hardware anyways, but I'll make sure its in a repo before units are shipped. FYI we are aiming also to hit robotics applications which won't work well without open-sourcing, so its definitely happening. Just don't want people seeing my ugly half-finished code. 

Hope you guys enjoyed the update!

There is more than 1 type of such chips. TI and ST make some chips like you are talking about with an all-in-one package. But there are also some chips with more basic interface that just generate the waveforms based on very simple inputs. The reason we don't use those is their zero velocity performance is pretty much terrible. They are also too low power and designed for things like computer fans etc.

Hey mate, I’m staring an EMTB build based on a full suspension chassis, end result will run 10” tyres. I have just bought 2 APS 6384 Sensored motored and plan to run it on a 12s6p cell made of 30q with belt drive 15T/66T. Do you (or any of the other boffins) on here think the current draw will be too high?  I have been into mountain boards and off-roading for a long time, it’s electricity that scares me 😖. Last thing I want to do is order one of these and cook it days later. What would be a better setup? FOCBOX unity or 2 Focboxes?

Unity will be a better setup if you're OK waiting a 1.5 months for it. At 6p 30q 100 amps should be a nice conservative max battery amps, and the unity will deliver more power to your motors since it has better thermals. You'll also get all the integrated features that make the electronics in your board easier to setup (app, integrated switch, integrated bluetooth etc.). Definitely reccomend the unity for people that want to save time/energy/risk wiring up a bunch of different components since it is a more integrated solution. 

That said, 2 focboxes should get the job done if you want to be riding ASAP.

@Woody1989 the Unity will be able to deliver the power you need. See my reply below on how to further optimize performance.  

@billappleton  Really depends on your power draw. For an average power board (10s4p and 80 amps per motor max)  you can mount it pretty much anywhere and get good performance. If you want to improve performance during super long hill climbs mounting it to a large aluminum plate within your build will help dissipate heat greatly. For maximum performance you'd want that aluminum plate to have some airflow (expose one side of the plate to airflow) . The unity will be able to throughput  close to 5kW in a configuration like this. @Blasto and I are working on a datasheet with some plots to show what different loading scenarios look like with different thermal setups. Should be ready in a few weeks but I'll post some of the early results/plots here. 

@dougpage Yes, we are still on track. Currently testing the production units with @Blasto as I type this. We are having some very positive results. Identified a few minor BOM changes to fix issues with the new smart-switch but PCB routing is solid so no delays there. Currently testing dual 130 kERPM at 30 kHz pwm and everything seems to work smoothly. Need higher kV motors to test 150kERPM, we are running a 14S battery right at the bleeding edge of blowing everything up but the unity is going strong.

Are there any improvements to the Unity over current FOCboxes in terms of reliability at 12S? I'm currently running two FOCboxes on a 10S dual sensored 6384 200kv mountainboard in FOC mode but am thinking about upgrading to 12S. 

Because I ride my board in traffic every day for commuting, reliability is my top priority so I don't know how I feel about running standard FOCboxes at 12S (and also slightly over 60000erpm), particularly when I want to be able to draw 80A-100A total from the battery for extended periods of time for fairly long hill climbs. 

Been considering upgrading to VESC 6's but have also been curiously following the progress of the Unity...

All of the FETs on the unity are actually 75V rated fets. the only 60V component is the drv8301/3, unfortunatley that tends to be the failure point. There's also a 60V TVS diode across the power bus to sink transient spikes. We have even done some lab bench testing at 14s for stress testing purposes. The unity is definitely designed to support 12s. That said, there will always be some reliability trade offs as you move closer to the voltage limits, and its pretty difficult to say how much more risk you accept moving from 10s->12s.  Perhaps in our warranty replacement programs we could collect stats to obtain some meaningful insight into this question.

It's not likely too. The voltage spikes will likely occur on the motor phases during a few obscure cases that don't happen when things are working properly. The one exception would be if you went down a steep hill with low kV motors and exceeded the maximum rpm that caused back emf of the motor to surpass 60V.

So low kv motors can make more voltage (during braking) than high kv, even if geared to the same top speed? I'm interested to know how this works. I like low kv motors.

@Deodand
I've been hearing all this "80a per motor" in my head now and I would like to hear this info from you.

Because on enertion's website The focbox 4.12 claims
> 60A Continuous Current

and we know that's not true.

Can the focbox-unity's really handle double the current of our old focbox's?

Yeah I want to hear this from him.

Hex bench tested it with no load not in some enclosure, and he pulled the video before it could show if it would thermal throttle to like 30a.


Basically I want to know is the focbox-unity just an ESC with some tweaks and a better heatsink.
Or is it some amazing ESC that pushes more power and creates less heat while running.

Hi,

what kind of data could we read or control from UART interface?

There is a new law in my city for this kind of vehicles. We need lights and horn.
I was thinking to change my ESC with the Focbox Unity, and add some buttons in my remote for that functions. For that, I need to receive some BT commands in UART to connect it to an arduino controller.

Any one know how does it work?

Thanks in advance.

The thermal performance of the Red beta units is very impressive! But it looks like they are a full CNC aluminum case with more thermal mass then the production unit. Probably not a big deal, but something I thought was strange. Makes the beta unit look like it has an optional upgrade installed. :wink:

Edit. most of the heat is dissipated out the bottom side as far as I understand it? Which still have a full size heatsink.

@lrdesigns Ummm, that's ORANGE. How dare you :laughing:. Definitely was a concern when we swapped so we made sure the total mass of aluminum was the same. We were planning on die-casting the all aluminum case (milling that shell is prohibitively expensive for this complex piece) but the lead times would have delayed the launch  >2 months.  So after a lot of ideas thrown around in late-night vid-chat meetings we decided to go for a 3 piece case. 2 pieces that can be milled and a silicone over-shell for protection. @Blasto performed the same 80 amps testing that @hexakopter did a couple days back with the new case and the thermals aren't noticeably changed.  I'm working to add data-logging to our app so we'll post some plots soon. 

One final note is that the new case feels super premium. We will have a unit to show off in Vegas next weekend, can't wait for people to get hands on feel for it. 

@Itsmedant you need a BT module with special FW unlock to use metr.  @FredXanadu we did explore this avenue but its looking like we won't be able to support any kind of metr functionality with the onboard BT module. Would have blown our budget beyond what we had left (we are already a bit over for various reasons). The unity will still be compatible with their modules if you want to use their app.

Yes, I do agree that is an annoying behavior. I could do something like log the last 10 recorded faults to eeprom. Only tricky part would be no reference for when they occurred outside the session time since the unity does not have a real-time clock. Could also easily log them on the app-side but then you'd only have record of them when your app is tethered. Perhaps this is fine since normally people won't be experiencing faults, and they can tether their phone and log data when they are trying to track a specific issue.

@totalgeek9224 Couldn't agree more. Can't wait for these units to get in your guys hands. FYI @Blasto, @onloop and I all have flights booked for shenzen on the 9th of November to Shenzen, when we will go to make sure Unity production goes smoothly and also iron out any potential issues with raptor 2.1 production.

Let me tease one last feature for you guys that I'm super excited about implementing (disclaimer: currently it's a concept with clear path for implementation). Probably only something nerds will enjoy. What's exceptionally cool about this is it is something you can only do easily when running two motors from the same MCU since clock drift between two seperate MCUs would cause synchronous drive to not work. Vedder in the past has focused alot on bulk capacitance of the VESC and made some tools to analyze ripple current. [Here is a video where he is  demoing the tool to compute ripple current.](https://youtu.be/x6lPdI9OVQg?t=2504) In the video he states that the worst case loading is when the motor is being driven at 50% duty cycle (AKA half the max speed of your board). So the idea is... what if we drove each motor FOC phase 180 degrees out of phase. I.E. the peak turn on times occur perfectly out of phase between motor 1 & 2. At 50% duty cycle this would effectively eliminate most of the incoming ripple current. So I downloaded his open-source tool (Thanks again Vedder!) And modified it to see how this concept works. Let me show you some plots demoing this concept:

25% duty cycle:
![image|690x392](upload://2UJxrqvUD95ZkTWL4svXzbQOB7.png) 

50% duty cycle:
![image|690x395](upload://bTNBzYpPmZTuSjSWYM3xUxAMOT.png) 

75% duty cycle:
![image|690x391](upload://f9ZeQ2WpJXc0PalT6aHlfyBJ8gh.png) 

(Note that I added 1 amp offset to total bus current for easier visibility of seperate lines)

By offsetting phases we can nearly halve ripple current for a dual motor setup, eliminating losses within the motor driver capacitors due to ESR, and battery leads from peak pulsed current. It should also reduce the likelihood of voltage dips since each motor essentially gets twice the bulk capacitance. Can't wait till I have a spare moment to implement and test this feature.

```

---
## \#479 Posted by: Deodand Posted at: 2018-10-14T00:20:51.118Z Reads: 345

Nope! thats the cool part. the base frequency of pwm is always 20kHz (max 30 kHz for unity) regardless of erpm. Doesn't change much if the motors aren't in phase with one another. On a skateboard both motors duty cycle should be roughly similar since they will be spinning close to the same speed. The two motors pwms are actually already synchronized right now but they are currently in phase, one motor is in v7 while the other is in v0. Just need to fix adc triggering.

In the plots you can see the lower frquency waveform on top of the pwm frequency that's the motor driving frequency.

Probably about 75% of the heat is coming out of the bottom currently since there's more direct thermal contact there. Probably increasing the heat sinking on either side would be effective as the whole case heats up pretty uniformly during prolonged peak current draw.

Likely not. Those tariffs are for the most part on raw materials and industrial equipment. Since manufacturing isn't taking place in the US or AUS (no raw material imports) and the focbox is not an industrial component (we're talking jet engines and stuff) it doesn't get affected (this is just my speculation).

As @Blasto said I tested with the foc open loop command. So real 80A motor current flowing.

The unity supports full independent control of two unique motors. You can send different commands to both motors most easily through uart. There is actually a second ppm input on the auxilary header as well if you absolutely wanted to use ppm. A small firmware patch for dual independent ppm wouldn't take me more than an hour to implement.

Also, no clue why @Kug3lis is answering questionss. He has never seen the hardware and doesn't know our implementation :slight_smile: (is this the correct smiley to use after I say something slightly rude?)

@Deodand has convinced me to buy this product through cool and calm discussion under fire from this sometimes pretty harsh community, despite the pathetic opening post hype marketing and bullshit proceeding this project (which was a huge turn off). He's proven his ability and knowledge and he's active on this topic and the whole forum in general. 

Perhaps we should try keep things on topic and allow Jeffrey to answer the questions hes qualified to answer.

Just got back from renegade weekend in Vegas last night. Was a blast to meet a bunch of different builders from the forum. A ton of good discussions/ideas from the time spent there. I rode a raptor 2.1 with unity production sample inside  for the weekend (minus the new deck), really put some stress on it, towed someone back full throttle and [rode fast and crazy through desert trails](https://youtu.be/JzSrdT7sSKI). Several people had overheating issues with their boards in the desert but the unity held strong. 

This week @Blasto is visiting san diego so we will have some meetups to do further testing/analysis on the production sample units and refine the testing process for the test jig to ensure every unit(y) we ship is as close to perfect as possible. 

Getting to the point now where the Unity app and firmware need to be finalized within the next two weeks, and then we'll put up links to the repos on the product page.

I'm not sure anyone really said this but the Unity is the coolest looking esc! 

The only options we have right now for cool looking vesc's is with an aftermarket CNC heat sink housing. 

It's actually more of a selling feature for me than its power handling performance because I don't need even 50% of what it can handle at the moment. Don't tell anyone I said that. :flushed: But I always need my board to look more cool :sunglasses: / sexy :high_heel:

You can remove the cover if you want, we have applied conformal coating on the components/PCB so it is better protected from debris etc.

However for the best protection having it enclosed inside this silicone case will mean it's is very well protected.

So the power switch is not connected at all. You push a bit and it turns on. Then you can program the inactivity timeout I guess. I am guessing it can sense both wheels moving? Wont turn on unless a real push on both wheels? Thanks

[/quote]

I see this a lot when people talk about push to start. Why on earth would you want to abandon an important indicator that something is wrong with your board? Even Diyboards , some of first to start with this feature, left the power button on despite having such a feature. The power switch is you’re only for sure way to confirm your board is turned off in the event that the boards auto shut off feature isn’t working. 

The Power switch is your friend , stop trying to get rid of it.

@nuttyjeff The shipments should start in mid-November, think he means all 1000 out by the end of December. 

@Jc06505n  A battery LCD would also work as an indicator if power is up or not. I've been using the push to start with my Unity raptor 2, it's quite convenient. The threshold for turn on is dependent on the boards max speed. The raptor 2 no-load speed is about 33-35 mph and it takes a nice firm/sustained kick-push to get it to turn on. A few mph for a couple seconds, so I've never had trouble with accidental turn on in the trunk or anything like that (granted it would just auto-turn off again after the timeout period). Pretty nice to throw the board down, flip on  my remote start kicking and go as soon as remote connects. 


We'll know for sure once our first batch is out (quantity will help the statistics) but the switches seem bulletproof, we did 58V rapid on/off switching with added load capacitance on our production units and it survived all the abuse. We haven't been able to break any of our switches yet on the latest batch. I even accidentally nuked one of my units with no case/no conformal during testing when a metal shaving shorted a bunch of stuff and the switch on that shorted unit still works. Earlier on we were using a design similar to Vedder's anti-spark switch and it was having intermittent problems, the new high-side switch is seemingly more robust. 

The new remote will be the next big push. The release date will just depend on how many of our somewhat ambitious goals we leave on the table for the remote. We'll start sharing stuff once we are further along in the process, most of my focus has been on the unity firmware and app.

I can guarantee by mid November we will have production running, we will have finished goods in hand as we will be there in person to observe it happen.

The people who ordered first will most likely see tracking numbers come 3rd & 4th week of November. 

The reality is it takes time to process orders, the factory that makes the PCB isn't responsible for shipping, they need to send the goods to our fullfiment warehouse, they need to sort it and pack it and then send to the freight forwarding company.

Even if we begin Shipping in mid November most people who didn't order on day one will probably get the stuff early in December. 

On average the entire process takes 10-14 days.

Any chance you could summarise why you think enertion is breaking laws in regards to focbox? I’m genuinely interested. I’m no legal expert and know very little about software, but I understand you are pretty knowledgeable on the legal implications of open source software.

The reason your post confuses me is kinda summed up by these two things...

“4. In consequence we do not believe in public forks that are only a fraction different to the official release, with some added features that do not consider the greater picture! It is not good for the community and the project itself to release such software to the general public elsewhere.”

The GPL license very clearly states that the software is copyrighted by the author (Benjamin Vedder) and given to the owner (you -- the general public) and may be used without charge by anyone as long as the terms are followed.  The terms are that you must release any changes you make to the source code under the same GPL license (give it back to you - the public) and offer the source code to anyone.

Enertion does not do this.  They change your software and hide their changes from you, which revokes their right to use your software according to the license.  So they are stealing it from you, and then selling it back to you.  Because you own it - it's free and open source, and it's yours.

And no, I don't *think* they are breaking laws -- I have documented proof they are breaking laws.  I work in the software industry and have to comply with these same laws myself.

The unbelievable thing is that it's 100% free to comply with the law.... they just chose to steal instead.

Just to reaffirm to those who haven't read the threads spread across this forum (for maybe the 30th time, thanks @b264 for being constantly unclear in your comments),   the FOCBOX Unity firmware and the Focbox UI code will have source code posted in a git repo before anyone has a unit in hand. I have all the code, believe in what vedder has done for the community and look forward to contributing my own work as well. 

The best place to complain about the way the previous FOCBOX firmware wasn't posted is not this thread. The Unity has completely different firmware made by different people which I've said repeatedly will be open sourced. Doesn't make me feel great that the person who seems most eager to get their hands on my work is the same person badmouthing it every chance he gets (@Kug3lis)  but that's how open source works.  You give it to the community and see where they take it, it's quite exciting really. At least I can be sure @Kug3lis  will make some crazy high power dual driver with a unique spin and not just clone it.

I think that you can control the FOCBOX from Arduino, like if you are using a servo.
You have to put everthing in the arduino: lights, horn, BT receiver, and everything you want.

@Deodand

thought about this yesterday while riding my 6shooter build on bldc and being annoyed by the loudness.

there is a persistent braking problem with larger wheels (pneumatics, 6"+) locking up at low speed on FOC.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wheels-brake-locking-in-foc-right-before-dead-stop/39136

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-brakes-grabbing-coming-to-stop/46946

at the moment none of the vesc tools exposes the "Max ERPM at full brake" parameter for FOC (it's only for BLDC right now).

user @SkaterBoy58 found editing the xml file directly to be one "solution."

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-brakes-grabbing-coming-to-stop/46946/19

point is, is this a value that you can expose for the unity?

Yes I already have 2 Focbox (dual motor builds rock!!!!!) and a classic mini remote/receiver. I tried several stuff with arduino but I haven't found yet what data I am supposed to send to the vesc (PWM, Analog...) and how (same pin as mini remote receiver, UART directly...).

I also found this video showing how to get data from the running vesc (like temperature, voltage, speed etc) but I have to dig more into that also to understand better what's under the hood of the app (I'm not interested in Android while riding my board ;-) )

Sure, is this sensorless or sensored motors where the issue appears? I'll investigate and see what I dig up. It sounds like something that might be better served by a FW fix then a vaguely named setting one has to change somewhere in an advanced tab.  

The config value that @SkaterBoy58 suggests changing in the XML file isn't used at all in FOC mode. [See this link here, note that the value shows up in mcpwm.c (bldc source code) and not mcpwm_foc.c (foc sourcee code).](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/search?q=l_max_erpm_fbrake&unscoped_q=l_max_erpm_fbrake) Did changing this value really fix the issue for you guys or is it possible it just SEEMS a bit better (placebo effect). Either way I'll get to the bottom of the issue.

is this sensorless or sensored motors where the issue appears?

for me, it's sensored.  but believe it applies to uncensored as well.

It sounds like something that might be better served by a FW fix then a vaguely named setting one has to change somewhere in an advanced tab.
[/quote]

you're the phd, we defer to your expertise.  FW fix does sound better than messing with a setting.  that max erpm setting in bldc works very well.

[quote="Deodand, post:600, topic:64944"]
The config value that @SkaterBoy58 suggests changing in the XML file isn’t used at all in FOC mode. [See this link here, note that the value shows up in mcpwm.c (bldc source code) and not mcpwm_foc.c (foc sourcee code).](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/search?q=l_max_erpm_fbrake&amp;unscoped_q=l_max_erpm_fbrake) Did changing this value really fix the issue for you guys or is it possible it just SEEMS a bit better (placebo effect).

i haven't messed with this value, i suspect you're right.

Quick update, my flight to Shenzen leaves tomorrow. All the Jig software is done, firmware is nearly done (polishing, going to be a late night tonight) and from my understanding everything seems to be coming together on time. I will have a much better picture of where we are at over the course of the next several days. Wish us luck!

If you go down a big hill on 13s and exceed your max speed for a sustained time the unity will not handle it. The DRV is rated to 60V, it has protection against transient spikes beyond 60V which seem to be doing their job very well, but a sustained applied voltage beyond 60V is likely to end badly.

Shaving close to absolute maximum voltages always carries inherent risks but our limited testing seems to indicate the Unity handles these upper limit voltages well. the Fets and Power switch are all rated to 75V it's just the DRV's that are the weak link.

it´s written voltage rating of components 50V
but the components are rated to 60 and 75V.
your explanation makes sense, but than you don´t need the second phrase that it works only with batteries till 12s.

But not right that the components used for the unity rated for 50v only if in fact they rated to 60v or above.

Ok, so if someone wanted to add a device that is powered directly from the battery, switched on/off by the Unity, but draws more than 300mA, is there any option other than replacing the fuse to accomplish this?
```

---
## \#638 Posted by: Deodand Posted at: 2018-11-08T16:35:08.133Z Reads: 313

```
how much power does the device need? If it is in the 1 amp range you can simply bypass the fuse. Keep in mind at 10s 42-32V and 1amp is 42-32 watts so your talking a fairly powerful headlight or something. chances are that connector could probably go to 2-3 amps before is started getting hot. 

If you have an even higher power device, does it have input capacitance? If it has little to no input capacitance (less than a mFarad) you can wire the device to common ground and then jump a wire to a leg of  a cap or something. This would definitely void warranty though. Input capacitance matters because adding huge bulk capacitance after the switch could effect its reliability, it was designed to withstand the bulk capacitance of the Unity (we tested it succesfully with twice as much) but at some point it will blow the Fets of the switch from too much inrush if you keep lumping more bulk caps on top of it. 

An alternative solution is to use an independent switch for your device (a relay maybe, or a fet switch with a simple predriver) and use the 5v or 3.3 v line from the unity as a signal to toggle said secondary switch.

No, I won't be implementing that either as using wireless is just less reliable and potentially dangerous.

Thanks, I really appreciate your very thorough answer 😊 I am looking to draw anywhere from 0.1 to 1.5 amps. Is the fuse resettable?

 I like your suggestion of using an independent switch to control power to my device. I'll most likely go that route as i know at times I will need more current than 300mA and I don't want to void the warranty.

Apologies, @onloop is mistaken. On a previous hardware revision we had it wired such that the second ppm input could be coopted to a battery thermistor. On the new unit you could route the battery thermistor in using the 7 pin port (2 adc pins there) you'd also have to add in a 10k between 3v3 and the adc pin alongside the thermistor. Implementation on the software side from there would be relatively simple.

I have 4 ordered thru group buys and my 2 current FOCBoxes just took a sh*t due to a can-bus short (at least I think that’s the issue. I don’t know what else would cause both to fail simultaneously. All I did was test ride around the block, it worked great and I turned it off. A week later I tried to turn in on. The 2.4ghz receiver gets power and works fine, but there are no lights on either FOCBox and I can’t get it connected over USB. I literally have not even taken off the enclosure for a week since it was working so this is crazy.)

SPI is pretty easy as long as you have dedicated peripheral in mcu and a dma channel to catch data. Tends to just work since the clk signal keeps everything tidy in my experience (until you start going to crazy frequencies).

Yeah the spi periph will be totally free, the integrated bluetooth has a fully seperate uart interface. Would love to get some new accesories to hang off the 7 pin port now that bluetooth isn't using it. One idea is an LCD module to have a little board HUD with proper coulomb meter and tachometer etc to replace the more basic battery lcd.

Ofcourse a BMS :blush:, with the 6820 and the 6804 the uniti can be the spi master (and it has to be actually). 

And what if I told you the 6804 can also act as a I2C or SPI master (whilst being a IsoSPI slave) for maybe a USB PD battery charger IC :slight_smile:  and has its own voltage regulator and adc inputs! I am currently doing a project with this combination and will share it if it works. 

We should minimise the amount of mcu's in a esk8, and only have a single piece of firmware to do it all!

Get values, motor config and app config all have some additional values. Otherwise interface works the same. Its pretty easy to use new app/motor config once you have the .xmls to guide you. 

I think I'll add a get_legacy_values packet at the current get values ID then a get_unity_values as a new packet ID to increase compatibility with simple monitoring apps.

Rather than just throwing a bunch pf opinions around, do the math out and the conclusion is obvious. 

You can safely push 90 amps through an xt60 forever more or less and they will just get a bit warm. at 12s lets say the voltage is 50v since this is rough estimate. So 90amps×50 volts = 4.5 kW. Firstly lets look at whatever battery your using. lets say its massive high end 12s8p samsung 30q, (probably >5% of our customers being generous) at ~10 amps per cell the capacity derates somewhere below 2.5 aH, your battery has a capacity of 2.5 Ah× 8p= 20 Ah. So you will kill your insanely massive battery in under  20Ah/90A = 14 minutes, **Draining a 12s8p battery in 14 minutes isn't realistic.**

Now lets look at speed up an incline, say your going up a 20 degree slope which is insanely steep (steepest hill in SF is 17.5 degree). Your board is drawing 4.5 kW lets say its efficiency is 80%, it pretty much has to be this high to sustain 4.5 kW because this means you need to dissipate about 500 watts as heat  or things will start melting. Lets say for easy numbers the rider board system is 100kg. We will use the derivative of the equation m×g×h = energy to get m×g×vertical speed = mechanical power. At 20 degree incline vertical speed will be 1/3rd of your total speed (sin(20 degree)) so

3*4000 W/(100 kg * 10 m/s^2) = 12 m/s

This is 27 mph (43 km/h) up the steepest hill you could possibly find. An electric skateboard will **NEVER** draw sustained 120 amps at 12s. 

Part of good engineering is designing the system to meet the design requirements, not just throwing a bunch of the highest rated components together to feel special. **AN XT60 IS PLENTY**

I'm not saying he didn't work his ass off on the design I just don't see the reason to have the beta be black and the production to be orange I could see the other way around and I understand it helps differentiate between a beta and a production for trouble shooting reasons if someone sends you a picture.  You have said that the cover is made of silicone is it silicone like that of the wires where it is flexible or is it more of a ridged plastic.

But to answer your question you can ask me why I painted a board I did because usually there is a reason behind it and not because it looked cool.  I will tell you that most likely it is because that is what my customer wanted so that is what I'm going to give them.

Lets say for easy numbers the rider board system is 100kg.

This hits close to home, but calculations are perfect. :joy: 

Not saying I preordered, but I did. Let's just hope a dual 6374 will never reach high amps. :smiley:

True, that's not a conservative assumption but the rest are. You can derate the calculations linearly for hill speed so 150 kg would be about 18 mph up a 20 degree incline.

But can one replace the connector to XT90 just for sanity sake(also many pre-made battery packs come with it) or this will void the warranty as heck? Also what are the barrels for the motors? 3.5mm?

It's very easy to change to 5.5 connectors and xt90, took me 5 min so it's np that they come like that (even if I would prefer they wouldn't ) I just wish that the motor cable was awg 12 atleast, 14 seems abit low? That is a little more time spending swap and you need to solder on the unity and not cables. 

Here is a test, the setup is extremely easy, you have done a fantastic job with the install process of the software!

Thanks for the kind words! A big update to the app is underway at the moment to add more customization config for throttle curves, switch settings, etc. Should be live when people have units in hand along with all the source etc. I think for the source code I'll maintain a stable release branch alongside a testing branch. 

Here's a quick summary of the testing process since jet lag doesn't let me sleep:

Our testing jig is fully automated. 2 raptor 2 hub motors are plugged in with hall sensors and motor temp sensors. A 48V power supply is plugged in, alongside a fixed signal ppm cable, a programatically controlled switch and a usb cable. The software connects updates the bootloader and the firmware, reboots the unit and confirms that the update went succesfully upon reconnection. Then it reads the sensor values to ensure all temperatures, input voltages, etc are within predefined limits of normalcy. Next it runs a full dual automated motor calibration and then spins up the motors to 20% duty cycle for 5 seconds, it then confirms motor rpms are within predefined thresholds. Then it starts a dual foc_openloop test at 40 amps for 5 seconds. It monitors the change in temperature in the fets and ensures that this change is below a predefined threshold. Next it disconnects from the unit and tests the connectivity of the bluetooth module. Finally it presses the power switch to shutdown the module, then tries to connect to it in the powered down state. If the unit is powered off and unable to reconnect then the jig passes the unit. 

The factory wanted to test all units before conformal coating was applied and units assembled to make any reworks easier. We wanted the tests to be performed on the ready to ship units. The final decision was to do the full test twice since it only takes about a minute and is mostly automated. **This means 100% of units shipped will go through a full functional test twice** so we shouldn't see many dead on arrival :slight_smile:

What about including another step and running for a few seconds 80A open loop? Just to make sure all mosfet solder points are good and no intermediate failure or heating up would happen? I had couple of focbox fail because of bad solder joints even if they there functioning on the table without issues. 

Its just my idea to ensure quality of everything because 40A are not much compared to what it can handle what do you think @Deodand ?

Main issue was motor heat, so we'd need some massive motors on the jig. Was considered, but ultimatley it just makes the temperature rise on the board higher so just changes that threshold I think. 

It's easy enough to update one of the jigs with some beefy motors and push the units if we are seeing things slip through in this first run.

Maybe we should just put the motors in some de-ionized water :thinking:

They've pushed a few hundred of the boards through the test jigs already,  so probably we can just keep a close eye on this batch and not delay anything.  I think even without the extra amps we should catch a vast majority of errors but it's always good to have fixes in mind. Thanks for the suggestion. 

Maybe even a thermal camera on the whole setup to watch for hotspots in cold solder joints would be killer. I know there was some issues with pre-fabbed cables from amass. Might be tough to get an operator to read that though. 

Edit: thermistors on the jig side bullets would be the way to go... that will be on jig 2.0

Really value the detailed replies to 99% of the questions on here. A lot of it goes over my head and I don't need to care much for the finer details of the programming etc, but there's a question that is repeatedly batted away for six, and that's the one about replacing the XT60 for a 90, and the 3.5mmm bullets to fit regular DIY motor connectors - and voiding warranties.

Please can you confirm or deny that this is the case, please ?

Looking forward to my UNITY (ordered 15th Aug so presume I'm in the first batch....)

Here's as detailed a response as I can give. Disclaimer is I'm speaking just on my own understanding of the issue. 

 **We don't want you to take apart the unit**.We've tested and the connectors are amply sized for the high drain esk8 applications. 120 amp FOC openloop tests didnt melt them or damage them in anyway and the unity will throttle down before enough heat is generated in the connector since the FETs Rds on is higher than the connector resistance and they are tolerant to less heat than reflow temp of solder.  I already explained the xt60 is large enough. We perform a ton of testing to ensure quality and the second you take apart the unit and expose internals some of that quality testing gets jeapordized. If you melt through the connectors and that's what damages the unit it will be covered under warranty. 

 It isn't that we don't trust you, but everyone makes mistakes. Just the other night I took apart a unit to desolder a fet to ensure detection on the jig and set the thermal pad near my solder station, a piece of wire got stuck to the bottom thermal pad and I reassembled without looking like a dummy. It shorted across some of the exposed copper on the underside of the board and my unit went up in smoke. Is it enertions responsibility to replace this unit? I think most everyone would agree that it isn't, it was my fault for not working in a clean environment and taking proper precautions. 

On the other hand what if I recieved my unit, swapped out the connectors, and there also happened to be some unrelated manufacturing defect on the unit that caused it to work improperly? It is unlikely but possible, but it becomes extremely difficult to know for certain, we can be fairly certain the unit worked when we shipped it to you since we did a full host of tests, and if the connectors are swapped we also know you opened the unit up, potentially exposing it to conductive debris (conformal coating should help with this). If the failure is something like a fet shorting near one of the motor leads, my guess is you wouldn't be covered under warranty since it is most likely the issue arose during the connector swap. If however the issue was something totally unrelated (say the usb connector broke off or something) then my guess is we'd warranty the unit.

I hope people can understand the difficult position that puts us in. We can guarantee the quality of the product but once you tamper with it, it becomes unclear if the cause of failure was manufacturing defects. 

** Swapping connectors is unnesasary and should be done at your own risk.** That said the risk is fairly low, and personally I wouldn't be too scared to do it (clean up your lab bench beforehand :slight_smile:) 

A final thing I just thought of is that if you don't swap the actual wires and only the connectors on the ends of the wires, such an operation would be much lower risk since the pcb can stay in its enclosure. I'm really not sure on how that works out warranty-wise. Anyways this is why no one has gotten a straight answer because every case of warranty will be different.

Unity with 2 focbox should work great, haven't actually tested it but haven't really touched the CAN protocol stuff too much so it all should work the same.

I have a couple of questions about the unity controller.
1) It states current and voltage monitoring on all phases. How does it read each cell? I do not see a plug for the battery cells.
2) Is the bluetooth connectivity capable of reading live data? What android software does it have?
3) Is the switch an antispark one?
4) Can a fuse be added for further protection as with standalone anti spark switches.
Thanks.

phases means like motor phases not about the battery. It can only monitor total pack voltage not individual cell voltage.  This may be possible (in the future) with a smart bms that communicates to the unity.

Appreciate the detailed response to a question a lot of people have been asking in some form or another :slight_smile:

Although I would agree with you that the standard connectors should be plenty sufficient to handle the currents that the vast majority of users will be running, I can still see there being an argument made that even though an XT60 connector will work without any issues versus an XT90 connector, it's likely that an XT90 connector will be more efficient at handling the current loads that more performance demanding consumers might have. 

As an example, I'm currently running two FOCboxes from a 10S 1.1kwh pack to two 200kv 6384 motors for my 15km round trip daily commute which includes a few fairly long and steep hills. 
By the time I get home, my 10AWG wiring and connectors (mixture of XT60s and XT90s) do get a bit warm. Even though I've got my FOCboxes mounted to a big block of aluminium with thermal paste in between, it's not that hard for me to get them to start thermal throttling to some extent by the time I get home if I'm really trying to push them.

It's obviously a fairly minor issue in the grand scheme of things but I'm wondering, have you guys considered doing some basic tests and publishing the results of comparing energy loss between different connector/wiring sizes for more performance hungry systems considering the FOCbox Unity seems to be designed to work well with these types of systems?

Cables being warm when it's connected to a FOCBOX that is thermal throttling at 85C in an enclosure? How can you tell where the heat comes from? 

Googling around you can see that the contact resistance of 3.5mm bullet is in the 0.5 mOhm range. So at 60 amps you lose about 2 watts. Voltage drop even at 100 amps will only be 0.05V which is negligible as well. Obviously you could also calculate the wire resistance but it's going to be very tiny since the wire lengths are extremely short. Not sure how to calculate the resistance of the solder joints into the copper though... hm.

Would going 13s with the unity void the warranty, is it safe. I am pretty sure I read that going up a large hill full charge and full throttle would go over the limit but there are not many hills where I live and if I didn’t go full throttle would it be fine? Thanks

I don't get why everyone is up in a fuss about XT60 vs XT90. I got into this from FPV models, and I've seen the XT60 take one hell of a beating. There are people pulling 140A through it for 2 mins constant, 260A burst current. hell, today I was soldering up a 10s lipo for my board, broke out the multimeter to check some voltages between main ground and the balance lead and shorted the xt60 male I was using as a soldering jig. the multimeter probe was molten, there was one hell of an arc and bang, but the connector didn't fuse, I could unplug it no hassle whatsoever. The hobbyking product page for the xt60 shows what happens after 5 min of constant 70A, and I can't conceive of the situation where your board is pulling 70A for 5 mins unless you have a death wish

fuss about XT60 vs XT90
[/quote]

I think the main thing is, if the mfg specs 60a for the connector, you're taking risk pushing it further. A conscientious manufacturer will have some room past the max spec, but each connector will have some variance, and each manufacturing batch will have variance. And there's wear and tear to account for. Some manufacturers specify expected cycle life for their connectors (I don't think AMASS does, at least for XT series).

Also there's like 5 different types of XT60. Perhaps the different types have slight variances in their fit.

It's kinda like the 30Q cell. Most current tests have it running happily at 20a, but mfg specs for 15a. You might buy a cell tomorrow that works at 15a but catches fire at 20a.

So the manufacturer draws a line, and we choose which side of the line to be on. If you want stuff to last long, you stay on the conservative side. If you're hotrodding and overclocking, go the other way.

We're routinely exceeding specs of nickel strips in battery packs too.

@onloop  @Deodand  Can I ask you to update your website, I have been informed by customer service that the Unity's first batch is already allocated, and all current orders, including mine ;-( won't be dispatched until March, (second batch). (i ordered a few days ago)

I am now going to have $4000 dollars of component parts for my build laying around waiting on the Unity, for three to four months. (including 60x21700 cells, silly of me I know!). "Order Now & secure stock from first batch"

Your website still advertises this ![Capture|518x500](upload://593dLFg3pnFpnYCWZM7F2oOroNA.png)

Honestly, we don’t know the exact answer to this question, mostly because people can cancel/modify order qty, also it depends on Raptor 2.1 production volumes, these variables make it hard to have the exact numbers on a daily basis.

**We are very close to sold out, it’s borderline atm.**

If you want Focbox Unity, The best bet is to submit your order asap, this ensures you get the fastest delivery.

@moone, thanks mate, this post is a long one, 

Still not sure if that image should still be up on the site, as it gives the impression that you are guaranteed to get one from the first batch if you order now, which is not the case. 

Anyway, i will wait until the first batch is shipped, (you never know i might be lucky!) before i think about alternatives for my build. Going to struggle to find an alternative though as the small size of the unity makes it very appealing.

(below) LaCroix with 60x21700(12s5p) cells, not sure anything else would fit (it's super tight already) and i don't really want to drop a row of cells.

On the product page at the Enertion webside it says it can support up to 12s. So I think that is the answer to your question.

Does the Unity have any kind of mounting holes? For example to make bottom exposed to the outside of enclosure for cooling as I guess top (Orange part) is mainly used for connections. Maybe it can deal with dual 6374 149kV beltdrives(~4.5kW theoretical maximum) no problem while in the bottom enclosure? What about hot (30'C) summer days? @Deodand

I realize they are on the bottom, but the cooling "fins" are on the top mostly, with connectors which is weird to me.. Means if I mount it bottom-to-deck and leave the bottom of the enclosure open, some connectors like the receiver one would be exposed to elements without the silicone cover..

Bill, all the words from Jeff so far have been, no additional cooling needed unless you're pulling CRAZY current. Just mount it however you wish and enjoy.

If you're pulling crazy amps, the heat is all in the bottom aluminum plate.

There are no best practices as only employees and beta testers have units in hand.

Any additional metal will help, metal exposed to air will be even better. But with integrated bluetooth and an app in hand you can just go for a hard ride open up the app and see how your temps are doing. If you want to lay some plans an anodized aluminum sheet for mounting all electronics is a good start for strength and good thermals, but floating it on double sided tape is probably fine for most applications.

Hey Guys! Sorry about the lack of updates from China, partly due to my own jet lag and partly because even after we got back we were still sorting through a few details/fixes to make sure everything went smoothly, and I wanted to post solutions for you guys not problems. 

We identified a few interesting challenges when implementing all our updated testing processes for the unity and the raptor 2.1. It was definitely a struggle (way harder than I imagined) but also quite rewarding once we got everything working. Most things were just minor details that we were able to find quick solutions for. 

Toward the end of the week we identified a rather strange behavior with the power switch when testing our motors within a full raptor 2.1 assembly, that didn't occur anywhere else before. Spinning up the motors at specific speeds was (rarely and intermittently) causing false positives on the power switch press detection within the MCU. The power switch within the raptor 2.1 passes through our bms which extends the switch wires by about 70mm and we also updated the switch to have longer wires for the DIY people that might want a little more slack in the switch wires. 

We came to realize when the momentary switch wasn't pressed this wire was acting like an antenna. Further testing showed that only very specific switch wire lengths cause any issue, too long and it goes away too short and it goes away. If we tried voltage probing the pin the issue would disappear as well so it was impossible to monitor without an active probe. EMI demons. 

I devised some software fixes that patched over the problem, but ultimatley we decided the safest solution was to add a small capacitive load at the base of the switch wire to add impedance that will damp out any antenna oscillations before being read. When you guys recieve your units, you should see a little 0603 cap between pins 3 and 4 of the switch connector:

![20181119_183314|690x388](upload://szYfQS6dK0Hr8xfogjSYRREUFrR.jpeg) 

This is my work with sub-optimal soldering station. Should look cleaner on the units we send out. This fix was passed to the factory a few days ago and since then all the units are being modified and re-tested. The next batch of unities will of course have this capacitor added to the pcb layout but for now this fix should ensure no strange behavior with switch false-positives. Though this issue may have only surfaced in just a few peoples builds, we are determined to launch the safest and most reliable motor controller available. Since the fix can be applied quickly without disassembling the units, they should still be shipping out within the week.

Just kidding... there is frequent updates on shipping through this thread man. Scroll up a bit, I reckon the answer is in the last 20 posts.

(Apparently shipping next week)

Edit: I see it’s you providing the updates... so yeah I dunno man. I preordered in the first week, I’m hoping I get a shipping code any day now, hopefully by next week. I’ll be pissed if I don’t get it in hand by Christmas.

Last I heard units were being boxed up tomorrow, not sure what the delay between boxing and shipping is but I can't imagine very long. 

I've been super busy with my work, giving lecture tonight to the class I'm TAing and huge end of quarter project stuff. It is going to be really tight between getting all the software tools polished and uploaded before people have units in hand. I'm going to focus on just having **something** ready in time (how annoying would it be to not be able to test your beautiful new controller) but know that within the first month of launch there will be **a lot** of extra features coming in. Torque curves might be one thing that won't have a proper UI in place for instance but I'll do my best. I'd rather implement the extra features slowly and correctly with as few bugs as possible as opposed to throwing in a bunch of last minute stuff that is untested. 

I'll try to also have the full tool ready for computers so if you're experienced and want to go deeper into the settings you still can.

That box does look good in all fairness. Very much like a cell phone or something. It's only a matter of time before diyeboard and friends send out their hub motor escs (worth about $50) in a similar box.

Meepo's effort is hilarious !! But I guess they are not really any competition to you guys so it's just irritating rather than anything else.

[quote="billappleton, post:884, topic:64944"]
A few people asked how they were made. If you get a 5.5mm and 3.5mm set of bullets, you will find that the wire side of the male 3.5mm bullet can be forced into the wire side of the 5.5mm female bullet. Might have to drill out the 5.5mm size a little. Then just hit them with some solder.

Short prayer with a big impact on our environment. Really sad to see. Mobile phones mostly come in a 100% cardboard box these days. Today I ordered something from America and I could tick a button - Im happy with a used, recycled box. Clicked it straight away. Who needs a brand new box if it's for the bin anyways.
Paper is the rain forest killer no.1. Plastic as packaging material is a big no no if its not recycled material. A good product doesn't need a glossed up box - you can ship it in a brown, recycled cardboard box.

Sorry mate this not about a product but the stuff you wrap around it, which has no influence on how the product works or how good or bad it is. Packaging is stuff that is flown around the planet to end in the bin which is emptied into a landfill or into an incinerator. A product sits in foam, around it a cardboard box which is then boxed in another box because the nice, high value box should not get damaged.

[/quote]

The redistributor then puts the box into another box which is another box adding to the pile.This is a lot of material to move an item from A to B. It's called a Russian doll packaging and has become a huge problem in the last years, especially with online distribution. Since most companies want the box to ad additional value to the product, many boxes are made from non recycled materials, gloss printed, bleached or tinted, use valuable materials or a mix of materials etc. Beside the fact that it's not good for our environment to use precious materials for packaging, Russian doll packaging also means transporting unnecessary weight and air via plane.

If you design a small box that is actually suitable to ship the item, no second box or prayer is needed. Such a box can be made to 100% from recycling cardboard if designed clever enough. You stick the label on and that's it. If you want to ad value to your product you can drop something of value into the box. 
Forgive me, I just hate to see one time use boxes that need to get boxed. You end up shipping triple the volume of the product itself and use triple the amount of packaging material needed. Millions of products are shipped every day...

I was just referring to @brenternet comment. He hit the nail on the head. 
The internet if full of unboxing videos. Millions of people watch them and it causes big trouble because manufacturers think they need to follow the trend and promote their products through the use of a glossed up box that finally sits in another box.  

[quote="brenternet, post:925, topic:64944, full:true"]

Truth is: You present your product online without the box, customers buy it not expecting any fancy packaging and most people are happy when they receive it undamaged in a simple box. And if there are some stickers or a pack of gummy bears in the box they are totally happy.

Can’t stand the cutout issue of the Flipsky 4.20 anymore. :tired_face: Might be a bit overkill for my budget build, but fuck that I want to pull the throttle and braking hard up and down the hills in my area, while enjoying the quiet of FOC and laughing at Boosted Leaf-blower Board.

What would you guys do, wait for the unity, or build with 2 single foxboxes? I can always hold on to the focboxes for later. I also have a DieBieMS for this build too so I don't need the switch on the unity.

Hey guys, been refining the firmware for the unity, you may recall one of my previous nerd posts: 

[quote="Deodand, post:477, topic:64944"]
So the idea is… what if we drove each motor FOC phase 180 degrees out of phase.
[/quote]

Well I implemented the idea yesterday and tested it today, here are measurements from the scope on the ripple voltage across the legs of one of the bulk caps:
![IMG_20181206_113440|690x316](upload://xC1mOAwKuH0iHWpKzFRCAEoaGfK.jpeg) 
 Here is with the standard FW: 
![image|512x235](upload://eMdHYjKYpXcmhPe9nOon9LrBnmm.jpeg) 
And here is with the updated FW which pulses motors alternatley:
![image|512x235](upload://po9S3NxXN7cDG88d8j0oUCN5qqP.jpeg) 
We can see the frequency has doubled from 20 kHz to 40 kHz but the amplitude has been halved. For this experiment both motors were loaded with FOC openloop at 5000 erpm and 60 amps:

![IMG_20181206_112437|690x316](upload://jihWSVZw4QEffLYUpltZ4uxgxeA.jpeg) 

This should really help to smooth out the spikes on the voltage line that can cause potential faults :smile:

Besides, you want redundancy in your protection systems and fail-safes. These boards are no joke if something were to fuck up, especially with the batteries. I thought the same thing when I first saw the Unity, so I see what you mean. Point is, no reason to put yourself at risk just to save a few bucks.

The other reason a BMS is desirable is that it monitors per cell voltages. So you can set the Unity to shutoff at say 30V, but you can tell the BMS to shut off if any cell string goes below 3V for example. Also redundancy.

Enertion Unity.....yes the bird has landed and is on the ground in the US...,200 Unity controllers will be shipped via USPS for US customers all have tracking numbers sent with via e-mail to customers. The large qty discount group buys have been shipped to group buy leaders. All products are shipped via priority mail and will arrive in three days or less.  Individuals that are in group buys will be receive product once coordinations receive, package and ship.  

I can confirm 22 went out today and an additional 183 Unity controllers are going out tomorrow. All customers will receive complimentary Enertion safety whistles as a free bonus for supporting the initial group buy.  

So you still are skeptical...all group consolidated shipments are going out as well.. 50 for @JLabs, 21 for  @thisguyhere and @ksfacinelli has his as  well...this photo is just the individual buys that were through the Enertion site but don’t worry others are on the way as well. These bags have over 100 controllers going Saturday morning 12/8/18 again you all will receive USPS tracking via the e-mail you provided at ordering.

I have to extend to Jason and the Enertion Team appreciation for the professional and quality nature this product has been packaged and shipped as well as throwing the bonus free bling of a safety whistel that is a real cool piece.

The easiest way to comply is to use an [enertion github account](https://github.com/join) to fork Vedder's code ([bldc](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc) and [bldc-tool](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc-tool) and/or [vesc-tool](https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_tool)) then publish your changes as a commit to the master branch of each repository.

There are an unlimited amount of ways, including mailing CDs to customers who ask -- but this is by far the easiest and cheapest way. (is free)

A better way would be to leave the master branch alone and create a branch called "unity-1" and put all the changes there.

There is a thread about the topic. Open source, rights and obligations....

If you don't know how to follow the license, you should not distribute the code until you got yourself educated. 
Since distribution happened already, you should get yourself educated fast.

A: The GPL License needs to be distributed together with the product (hard- or software).
B: Customers need to be informed that the product or parts of it are licensed under the terms of the GPL. 
C: You need to offer the exact source code that is matching the software found on the device.
D: You need to tell your customers how and where they can get access to the sources.
E: A copyright notice needs to show.

You can ad your copyright if you changed the code. It should be clear what the changes are, and to which part of the changed code your copyright applies. You don't need to ad your copyright btw. GitHub makes it easy to compare code and see who is responsible for which changes. GitHub sorts out many issues the GPL brings on the table. 

For new files, you can apply your copyright. You always need to apply the GPL license to those files, even if it's 100% your work. The GPL is viral!

@Deodand you need to create orgnaisation under Enertion name, fork a vedder/bldc code create branch so it would make changes more visible and push everything there. Add license headers with your name/enertion name to new files you created, add license file stating that its based on vedders work with gpl license text and you clear ;)

Thanks guys, all this info is great. Setting up org now, one final question the license statement at the top of each file goes: 

"This file is part of the VESC firmware." 

Is it correct to leave this or change it to something like:

"This file is based of code from the VESC firmware."

If it doesn't matter I'll just leave it.

```
People have been running focboxes with FOC forever and it is a 2 shunt design. Ultimately 3 shunts is more information on the state of the motor, but as soon as the motor is in motion it isn't a terribly hard system to model/estimate/track. The term "acceptable" is not our aim with the unity. It is an absolute monster and extremely reliable. During my FW testing I have coded some really bad things that cause dangerous levels of current to be dumped through the units (blown multiple 70 amp slow-blow fuses instantly) and the thing is just fine afterwards. @longhairedboy had a hell of a time breaking his beta unit and we've only made them more robust since then (he had water damage on a beta unit without conformal coating). 

A three shunt design will see some advantages in robotics/automation applications where precise and fine control over fractions of an amp can yield real world benefits. Not really the case for eskate, no one will be the wiser if there motor is getting 30 amps or 30.1 amps. That is the reason why for the eskate application a well designed two shunt design can do everything a three shunt design can. Once a larger current is flowing through the motor the system becomes extremely observable and more measurement inputs won't offer much extra information on system Dynamics.

IF you want to stay ahead, make a conformal-coated FOCBOX-like thing that can handle 75V and without DRV83xx parts.

Combining parts together is worse because then if something fails, you're triple-screwed.  And single motor builds.  And dual independent.

Higher voltages and modularity is the next way to stay ahead in this game.

I think there are tradeoffs with modularity. For the experienced builders especially there are some key benefits. But more independent components opens doors for the less experienced to make mistakes, wether that be in component selection or wiring. For example, selecting an anti-spark switch that can't handle the capacitive/constant load of the motor driver, wiring a Can Bus/ppm incorrectly etc. 

The unity offers a foolproof solution, it will be wired perfectly everytime. The synchronization of both motors now also offers the unique value of alternating the current spikes during on-time which doubles the effectiveness of the bulk capacitors. But we are experienced builders like you, so don't worry you will be very happy with what we are developing.

@bigben I'd rather not discuss the financial details as some things are still being worked out, but in my experience Jason has done an awesome job treating me with respect and I feel I am being compensated fairly. We will continue making cool stuff together I think :smile:

Also we're talking about phase leads here, not DC power mains. There is no continuous current, its pulsed like AC. 

I've been running 12awg wires on my motors for years now and i'm about to drop them to 16 awg to see what happens as well as shorten them. I have a feeling i won't notice any difference at all except that now my sensor lead bundle is the fattest wire.

Good news! I think I have version 1.0 of the app and tool nearly ready. There's definitely some bugs in there, was up till 3am last night finding and squashing as many as I could. Just gotta get all the code into a repo so I can release the binaries. Hopefully by the end of today I'll have some download links for: 

FOCBOX_UI_1.0.apk
FOCBOX_UI_1.0.exe
FOCBOX_TOOL_1.0.exe

I'll see if I can get a static linux build done as well. The sources will be live as well so hopefully someone from this lovely community can produce a build for mac. IOS would have to be side-loaded which is a painful business.

Here's a feelgood post now that I see light at the end of the tunnel :smile: :

We are insanely excited for you guys to receive your Unities! Sincere thank you to everyone who pre-ordered and put your faith in us. We've been pushing ourselves pretty hard the past couple months to make sure we live up to the hype. Between circuit design, firmware dev, app dev, bluetooth board design, bluetooth firmware dev, manufacturing QC processes etc. all the pieces are finally coming together! Charles and I flew halfway around the planet to make this thing a reality, it is a crazy globalized world we live in. This will be the first thing I have designed that will be used by hundreds (soon to be thousands) of people. :exploding_head: 

We'd also like to thank everyone here on the forums, the product wouldn't be what it is without all the acumulated information and creativity of everyone here. I personally spent many hours pouring over broken ESC threads  gathering information on different failure modes we could prevent, and ideas for common features that were missing. That isn't even mentioning all the direct feedback and guidance you guys have given us since we announced the product, even if sometimes we are too stubborn to listen :wink:.  

 Every component isn't perfect (yet) but with your help we can always keep improving. Don't hesitate to hop on the forum with your issues, I am going to spend this christmas unwrapping and solving bug-reports I think. I believe the unity will be a huge stride forward for reliability, performance and ease of use compared to existing state-of-the-art. My dream is for it to decrease the learning curve on DIY builds and enable more creative folks form different backgrounds to enter the DIY eskate scene.  Can't wait to see what you all build!

Yea, dude. I really appreciate the work you and Enertion put into this. It really shows that you guys put your heart and soul into this. I haven't received my yet, of course but I'm super hyped. I am currently working on my first build and one of my biggest worries was figuring out the complexity and daunting learning curve that is the vescs. I know I would have eventually learned it and figured it out because I am stubborn. But I know my first build will be so much easier because of this and I won't have safety concerns, at least pertaining to the motor controller.

Hi Jeff,

Thanks so much for your efforts on our behalf.

I am a Silicon Valley CTO and software engineer, and have written many consumer and enterprise apps.

I am wondering, why would the iOS version have to be side-loaded? Why not the app store?

So I think they're going to distribute the source and let those who can -- compile it on their own.

Usually the copyright holder can be identified, and an alternative license purchased. 

Most companies that release software under GPL have an alternative license, proprietary with support, etc.

There is lots of software like this on the App Store, for example Firefox, etc.

Hopefully by the end of today I’ll have some download links for:

I’ll see if I can get a static linux build done as well. The sources will be live as well so hopefully someone from this lovely community can produce a build for mac. IOS would have to be side-loaded which is a painful business.

I contacted the support, guess it was carl, and he confirmed it will be updated .....

A few other new things like button settings and throttle curves directly on the app.

Yeah there are 4 settings there,

Batt
Speed
Wheel diameter
and... TEST ERPM - RPM - Which I'm guessing are the motor poles? Can't seem to find a pinion to spur ratio.

Yeah so once your board is connected, hit that button:

[quote="nuttyjeff, post:1287, topic:64944"]
TEST ERPM - RPM
[/quote]

It will prompt you to turn one of your wheels 10 times by hand then hit OK. It will do motor poles and gear ratio lumped together in a single detected number. No thinking required :laughing:

Right now its saved as a persistent variable in the app. I think in the future I will have the numbers seperate (motor poles and gear ratio) and written to the Unity. Only reason being with motor poles, flux linkage, and winding resistance I can get a very accurate estimate of motor size and suggest a safe maximum motor amps limit during config.

It's possible to run bldc. I've had motors spinning and I think with more effort I could have gotten it working well. But honestly FOC just works way better, and is easier to implement in a dual motor setup because of how the control scheme works. I think FOC is the way forward anyways and it works great on the unity with config easier than ever.

Shit its a tiny little thing.  I imagined it being at least the same size as 2 focs.  Love the attention to detail in the packaging too.  Wiring diagram, set up guide.  Beats the focbox in a box (work it out yourself) of yesteryear.

Its really well made from what I can tell. Nice clean solder flow around the components I can see from the top (without voiding my warranty)

Everything feels really strong and stable on it from a physical standpoint. I think it was @b264 that told me to imagine slamming my board against a concrete wall for 30 minutes and design it to withstand that....with this mounted well on a deck, you won't have a problem with that.

I had unity pre order, 2x focboxs from BF, and another unity from BF, all separate orders. I emailed trying to save them (not me) some money on shipping and suggested they just send all four items together when they are ready as I'm not in a rush.....

Got the focboxs last week, a currently shipping in transit unity, and an awaiting fulfilment unity.....

I did offer... !! 😂

Yeah well, there isn't really anything an esc can do to a motor on the bench that would cause the motor to be permanently broken unless it's like way over-rated and melted the windings which takes time. So if the motors permanently siezed then something was wrong with the motor in my estimation. Either way the individual bought platinum warranty I think so they should be covered. Carl is handling it.

Yeah it's a bit confusing what I mean by this sorry, really tired last night. Can an ESC make a motor seem broken when it isn't? Absolutely. Could an incorrectly configured ESC break a motor after you go for a ride on it? Yes, through melting the windings or overdriving it's maximum speed, the latter would only happen on high voltage high kv motor with low pole count. 

However, if on the test bench just revving the board up upside down the motor stops running, and then even after being disconnected from the ESC without ever being ridden the motor is still broken (siezed in this case) it's hard to imagine how the ESC could cause this, unless maybe the motor was extremely hot, like 200 Celsius such that it could melt the insulation etc. Would be pretty noticable I think and it should smell awful like burnt insulation .

@Deodand Hey probably a bit off topic but this question has baffled me for quite some time. How does a random Chinese ESC do motor detection?

there's 4 mounting holes on the bottom of the heatsink, so you can easily attach another heatsink to the unity without opening anything up. 

The Unity was the only v ESC flavor that was able to sustain 80A (each motor) for 90 seconds. But i guess extra cooling/thermal mass will not hurt.

Do you know when there will be a manual uploaded I used the link on the card that came with my unity but there was nothing there?? Also as I am new to setting up a esc is there a way to adjust the max speed in slow  setting vs fast on nano-x controller as well as variable throttle response for both? I had a quick look at the windows software couldn’t see anything that directly isolated which throttle response/max speed should be used for each? Ideally I was hoping to use the slow mode for cruising max speed of like 30kph and fast as max for the board which in theory is 60+kph..

sorry if this isnt acceptable for this topic mods, but I figure I should put it somewhere public, so someone can offer their opinions if they'd like

Im currently in my second year for Computer Information Systems, so I should be able to fill a general CS job... just needless worrying on my part I guess, its the one thing im good at, besides getting my libraries to scramble themselves(please dont ask, im still triggered.)

@Sn4pz - animals/insects are no real issue imo don’t actively have to do much to avoid getting hurt than you would in the states haha. 

Although I would kill for the free shipping and product availability you have over there! Then I remember I don’t have to deal with Trump and his build a wall government and it makes Australia see alright hahahaha ;)

Honestly don't stress yourself out about getting a job. There are tons out there and companies love hiring young people because they get paid less than their more experienced counterparts. Wish me luck, my company is 12% of the way through FDA trials and still hitting our numbers!

Man... The journey it's been. Short and sweet :
Took a job straight out of college with a tiny startup company instead of any of the huge Cincinnati dayton or Columbus corporation jobs. Hit so many snags developing this product that I almost gave up twice. Took the time, care, and money to make sure no more snags would be hit (impossible) and it's going much more smoothly. www.ndtbio.com if you're bored.

Practice :slight_smile: 

Last year i decided to learn CAD. Once a week i would find something around my house then CAD it as good as i could. Each time you make something you figure something new out. Helps you think about how things are constructed and how to build stuff.

With motor detection, can they both be done at once? If they can be done independently I guess thats also an answer to your question :)

yes you can run a single motor, make sure to tape up properly the second set of phase leads. Also during the motor detection, when prompted to spin the wheel, you will need to let it timeout. spin the single wheel and wait 15 seconds for the timeout

Not for quite a while seeing as Jeff just finished up with pre release debugging and release , now needs time to work with any issues firmware and hardware wise that may arise from the newly released unities, and iron out any bugs that he could fully catch before released and any known bugs that are present within the VESC tool. 

From there he would need to recreate/create an entire app (maybe natively if he goes the iOS detection only, would be better if he did do with a language like react so that he can releases a multi-platform application that’ll allow for easier same time updates) that would allow for the configuration of the unities software , debug that , test to ensure it that it works across the various iOS versions and screens, prep it for the eventual Swift 5 changes (if native), all while adding software updates and handle bug testing for the unity. 

Personally I wouldn’t expect Jeff to released such a thing , especially one with so much to go wrong for at least a year

@Deodand on behalf of other app developers (and myself) I would like to thank you for keeping existing version history of bldc.git and adding UNITY changes on top of that. A little meh is that you changed tabs to spaces, not that I think one is better than the other, just a general rule of thumb to keep existing style.

Ofc it will, the sparking happens when two terminals are being connected physically and the device being connected needs to charge its caps, thus the big inrush current and sparking. No such thing happens on the Unity as the caps are behind the integrated "anti-spark" switch.

Yes there is a separate battery switch. Whole batterypack and enclosure are made by eskating.

Yes I have tried the continuity with my multimeter

Your multimeter have a resistance mode? When the unit is powered off can you measure between 3v3 and gnd and 5v and gnd on the 7 pin connector?

@CarlCollins
@Deodand 

Went for another ride today and everything went fine. Problem is back after I charged it up again, like yesterday.

Can this be related to me modifying the switch (always on mode)? This didn't happen the first two charges when I still had the unity powerbutton..

My battery needs to be turned on during charging for the bms to work according to eskating.eu. can this cause any trouble with the focbox being powered on during charging?

Huh... strange implementation...  im guessing the switch puts the bms in a fault condition to turn it on, for example shorting out the thermistor.

Can you confirm these are the events:

-turn batt switch on
-charge batt
-(unity is on)

-charge cycle done
-turn switch off
-unity is off

-Turn switch on, unity stays off

??

Tried turning it on without plug in, noting. Keeping the battery powered and plugging 5-pin in, nothing.. not even the led flicker.

 It does the same today - if I unplugg unity from battery, wait 2min, plug in and power, led will flicker for a second. Then it need to "rest" two more minutes before the led shows life again.

And I think when I did that about 30 times yesterday it came to normal life again.

I haven’t ever found a way to make the unit spark. The button is normally open momentary pushbutton so when its unplugged its the same as it just not being pressed.

So is a unity/battery set up this way void warranty if a spark ever fries the unity? Or do you still advocate for using an loopkey?

Yeah I'd recommend just using the built in switch for simplicity. A loopkey should be fine to use as well but you won't need any precharge resistor with your key, the onboard switch always controls the dV/dt to be constant during power on/off. You just need to do the little workaround with the switch bypass if you want that to be your power switch.

I’m a novice at this, but I do have a fuse on the positive wire coming from my battery to the unity. It’s a 32v fuse. Here’s my thinking on selecting the right fuse...

With my 10s3p pack (Samsung 30Qs) I figured my max discharge current will be 60 amps (20 amps per cell in parallel). I selected a 32v 60 amp fuse. Yes... that voltage is below my pack voltage (36-42v)... but it’s not terribly underrated.

Then I set my unity battery max to 60 amps. I figure in regular riding conditions the unity should be managing its draw from the battery so the likelihood of ever blowing the fuse while riding should be very low. I also have an 80 amp and 100 amp fuse, but can’t really see the point in putting one of those in if the circuit should never exceed 60 amps in any situation other than fault or failure.

For 12s4p (assuming 30Qs) I would be looking for a 80 amp fuse which is rated for at least 50v - provided you set your unity’s battery max to 80 amps.

Edit- I use a 60 amp midi fuse like this:

But you should probably use an 80 amp ANL fuse like this:

Maybe... but the raptor 2.1 e-tray does have a fuse. Looks like an ANL fuse in a fuse holder, and judging by other comments in this thread it’s at least an 80 amp, possibly 100 amp.

Matter of preference. I, along with a few others, would hypothetically rather risk blowing a vesc under some insane (hopefully unachievable) condition than blow a fuse and immediately lose control of your board when in reality the vesc might have been able to take the Amps. I don't like risking the unity but I don't like risking my whole self either.

This is my reasoning too.  I'd rather burn the whole thing to cinders than have a fuse blow randomly while doing 40mph.

EDIT;  I do advocate fusing the charge port and cell level on the battery though.  This will protect from a charge related fire.

Thank you for adding the charge fuse note! I should have stressed it earlier as well. On that note, @hyperIon1 and @hyperIon2 are working on including fuses in this exact fashion on their battery pack charge ports. This should have been standardized long ago!

Links incoming, one sec
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-anti-spark-xt-90-loop-key/204/104?u=venom121212

Basically, use an Xt90s loopkey for a physical on/off switch (you can have a push button start switch on top of this too still). If you want to protect your esc more than yourself, fuse the loopkey. If you want to protect yourself a bit more but risk damaging components, use a thick ass wire (10 AWG, high quality) to effectively DE-fuse, the loopkey.

When you did your remote calibration with the app, where your in Rspec mode? 

If the calibration was done in “normal”, then put in Rspec, the ppm signal will overshoot and the unity will see this as a bad signal

The Calibration need to be run in R-Spec mode... Or it will only include 80% of the throttle, and if you go over 80% it will stop working, which will happen if you switch in R-spec mode.

@JohnnyMeduse I was curious can we customise how much throttle we get in both normal and r-spec independently on the unity? I been playing with mine but couldn’t work it out? Or is this something built in to the remote in the form of it just runs the same throttle response but only to the % you mentioned being 80% of max? 

I am running the nano-x from enertion.. I was hoping to set normal to a nice cruising speed when at max throttle say 30kph and r-spec to be all out which in my configuration is about 65kph this was just so I could run it with out having to manually hold the throttle at a particular point. 

If it’s controller firmware only is there a way to customise this? 

Thanks in advance

Anyone able to help me with an issue with the nano x remote I have run set up on unity and turned the throttle curve down but on bench test it’s extremely sensitive in both slow/ r spec. It hits max throttle with only having moved 30% according to app on the thumb stick. In reality it’s got about 5mm between ramping up and max throttle.. which makes me nervous to get it on the road.. I have run calibration many times in both r spec and slow and haven’t been able to work it out.. any ideas on what I am doing wrong??

Unloaded it's common to not use much of the throttle to achieve 'max power' 

Set it up properly, put it down on the ground and ride just like normal, the added load should make it behave like normal

During my remote calibration with mid stick or 0 input on the remote, the Unity is reading 20%. if I trim my remote to get it to read zero then I can't get full throttle or reverse. I would love a way to calibrate my remote for the max endpoints and also manually set the midpoint. My remote it a trigger style so I have more throttle travel than brake travel.

Any chance of getting better than 1V resolution in the android app? 36, 37, 38, 39 volts is pretty much 20-100% charge. Similarly, what curve was used for the % for the battery? @deodand, @Ackmaniac it would be amazing if   the Unity and the Ackmaniac app played nicely together.

Is there anyone on this forum who is not complaining about shipping and would give me a review of this product. I don't care about the shipping never mind that. all i want to know is how robust, reliable and easy to use product this is? I recently blew a maytech vesc in under a week so i'm looking to do it right and spend money on quality parts and have them last rather then fixing cheap ones all the time.

Mine took 3 days from when I got my shipping notification to it being on my doorstep and I have to say one of the best thing about it is @Deodand . I have been asking him questions and after my first unity type c port came loose he instantly sent me a new one and I did not have the instant replace warranty. The thing is bullet proof and can endure @b264's test of slamming your board into the wall for 30 mins. The app is also a really great feature and it still is getting new features.

It's all code! 98% of the work is in the sophisticated VESC software Benjamin coded. It's a huge effort to code it and maintain the code base. The control loops work so smooth, I can let my 8 year old son ride my board. It's all a matter of the settings. You can lower the amps, put more ramping time in, soften the brakes etc. 
A mode where you would dial the speed would make your board very aggressive. It would not know how much power it should use to ramp from speed A to speed B. Voltage controlled hobby ESCs work a bit like that. Hardly controllable.... Imagine your car would have 500 hp and you would send the command to go from 50 to 70mph. How should it know to use a certain amount of power only?
Also note that motor RPM and Speed are directly linked. It's the same thing.

When people ride today they are constantly adjusting throttle based on desired speed / rpm. If you hit 20% throttle the board winds out for another minute before hitting final speed. Hills change everything and require constant adjustment. Feels wrong. A drone can hover. You can control where the drone is in the sky. It compensates for wind (hills) and battery. Skateboards should do this, with a tunable acceleration to desired mph. Somebody should try writing a controller like this on top of VESC. :) I’d also like to see this type of innovation moved to the controller.

You probably never tried a three phase shunt VESC or a bluetooth remote which can send the cruise control command to the VESC, keeping the speed you set by trigger. 
It's all there, implemented a long time ago. The VESC software can perfectly control the speed since years. 

Reason for non linear behavior to remote inputs:
When Benjamin started with the FOC code implementation (2014/15), he soon realized that three shunt designs would allow to get a lot more precise, nearly noise free measuremts, which allow a very precise and linear control. The two shunt designs do not get as good readings and in consequence respond non linear to throttle inputs, especially in the range between 60 and 100% duty cycle. People have complained about the power suddenly jumping from 80 to 100% . 
It is a known issue, well debated and there is little that can be done software wise to get better results. It's a hardware related limitation in measurement accuracy. 

Here is Benjamin's explanation:
https://vesc-project.com/node/403

The VESC can perfectly fly a drone btw. There is enough computational power built into it and it has been done already. Benjamin is a drone specialist.

I think it's personal preference really but think ultimately I disagree. Are there conditions where speed control might be nice? Sure, but an eskate is a lot like a car. The gas/brake pedal of your car does not control speed, it controls force/acceleration. There is a cruise control option, sure, but it isn't really used all that often except in the most mundane of drives. Additionally cruise control on a car can cause you to unknowingly push your car into inefficient operation. Decoupling the gas pedal from how hard the motor is actually being driven causes a disconnect between the user and the machine. 

I think my final and maybe most important point is that for every throttle input the person standing on the board needs to make a balance adjustment, creating a throttle that controls speed and not torque would mean different force response depending on throttle input. I won't disagree that maybe a more intuitive throttle may exist but speed control isn't it.

Also, we get it, three shunts will save the world.

I'm not a coder so I can't say for sure, but I think the Freefly Arc 200 does something similar to this. My logic is as follows. 

I go 0 to 25 mph in 16 seconds with a -40% throttle curve on flats, the 0 to 25 mph time is identical on 15 degree grade uphill.

Hey guys! Question. Is it possible to disable ramping up speed? I just want to control the speed directly based on the amount of throttle I give instead of letting the remote increase the speed all the time. 

Is that possible? If it is, how? I looked through many settings in the vesc tool but I don't know how I can achieve this.

if you want to control power without ramping there is a ramping speed adjustment somewhere in the remote settings.

if you want to control speed directly with remote then you need to switch the remote control mode to "PID speed control"

i dont think there are in the simple app so you will need to full vesc tool.

I would advise being carefull with both these options. if you disable throttle ramping there can be harsh changes in acceleration. If your in PID speed control and you let go of your throttle your board will apply full breaking power till you stop, probably throwing you off.

@Deodand right now I’m trying to build and run the Focbox_UI to run for iOS. I added a bit of code that should make BLTE connection better on OSX (the code is from another GitHub user that one can see in one of the closed pull request) 

I’m in QT Creator and Android and iOS isn’t working for me due to QSerialPort. While I understand why it’s not building for iOS (since that module does not support it) , how are you guys able to build an android application? It’s giving me the module error even though when I look at the code it shouldn’t. 

Also , I’m trying to build a OSX version of the Focbox Tool but I cannot find the source code for it. While the UI is great , I like the options of the TOOL better.

In the .pro file theres a define:

DEFINES += HAS_SERIALPORT

comment this out and it should fix it? 

For the tool its the same code base you just comment or comment: 

CONFIG += build_mobile

FYI the full tool feels pretty bad without a mouse. My hope is to get the UI to a point where all the in depth options are back in sub menus/ advanced sections but still tucked away to keep it clean.

Control the speed. Right now if my remote is pushed halfway forward, the motors keep accelerating to max speed. But I would like to motors to run at half speed ( the same value as the remote ) and not ramped up.

What remote that sounds really odd.. I’m running an nano-x and it definitely doesn’t do that unless it’s not loaded on a bench test but underload it cruises nice at 50% throttle. Sounds almost like the remote isn’t calibrated correctly

whilst I have no desire for Cruise Control on an eskate, for safety and attentiveness reasons, I quite fancy the idea of an optional (and selectable) soft 'throttle off'.

This might be a stupid idea, but my imagination thinks that after a full throttle blast the power drops off in a user defined, but linear or maybe an arc type fashion - whichever works better. Like after a quick blast on a push bike and you ease off the power delivered by your legs but there's still power going through the drivetrain. A bit like powered coasting down. Obviously any use of the brake would cut the power at any point on the downward graph to zero power and then the 'powered coasting' or whatever name is given to the function would need to be manually selected again for it to work.

Not saying I'd want this as a permanent feature, but on my long straight coastal blasts, where I might be going pretty much flat out for 5km at a time without needing to stop, I sometimes want to relax the thumb completely, shift postions, stretch my thumb, fiddle with headphones or simply scratch my arse or whatever, but don't want to cut all power to the gears. Can't see it being wanted with hub motors which freewheel almost like a regular longboard, but with belt drives there is a definite 'jolt' due to drivetrain friction if you offload the power delivery from full to zero.

Tell me this is crazy, tell if you think you'd have a go on a system like this, but don't ask me to do it cos I have no idea how to code electronics or make this work in an esk8.

It might be a stupid idea, but now I've thought of it I would want to try it :)

This is really easy to understand. The rider sets the max acceleration and max deceleration. Then they select a speed with the remote. The board moves to that speed given the max acceleration and max deceleration. When riding at the selected speed there is no acceleration or deceleration, just smooth riding -- even if there are hills or the battery is sagging, etc. Then the remote is controlling how the board moves in space and time, NOT the motor power.

Fair enough. I should stop telling you how to fix the problem. But please listen to the user experience of what the problem is that I am experiencing. :) If my thumb slips on the puck the board will accelerate or decelerate so rapidly that i am concerned. I am wishing that Unity had better tools to tame this kind of issue. I think other people will also experience this, especially because of the highly performant nature of the Unity hardware. I am hoping the solution will be in the UI interface, not the full TOOL, which has too many options. Best,

I'm listening but it's hard to understand how to fix your problem. How should I make a throttle that both sandboxes you away from raw power that will easily throw you from the board without handicapping your board? If your board feels like an untamed beast you might want to reduce max motor amps?

Max motor amps = Max board acceleration

Well, I don't think so. It's a Hoyt St puck and seems to be operating correctly. I have experimented with linear throttle curves and mildly S shaped curves that make the low level more sensitive and the high level less so.

I have reduced the motor amps, that helped some. And I have adjusted the throttle curve. I think the next step is the ramp up and ramp down times. If there is a change order here it might be to include the ramps in the UI interface. Also, last I looked, there was still that issue about the center point of the remote being offset (not at zero) for some reason. Thanks!

How is it NOT an issue if someone were to maliciously change your settings, turning them to the max and potentially injuring yourself and the board? Over Discharging lipos? Sending someone into the street?

There should be some sort of 4 digit key or something in the software of the Unity that is required to be entered before complete connection is established :L

Could probably ship it unencrypted, add an enable option to the app and when you flip it it tells you the pin code and saves it in your app.

The argument is not that its a _new_ issue (and no post above asserted such) but a potential issue. I can only imagine the possible liability that enertion could be in at a Raptor 2 Group ride where someone tries to configure their raptor 2 wireless but connects to someone else's. It's an issue that should be addressed as ESK8 grows. We build and ride for lasting solutions.

It has always been an issue, which is why I only use METR modules on my boards. 

Let's not go down the rabbit hole of malicious intent - I'd imagine it being hard trying to reconfigure your unity via BT in a group ride with 20 other people riding with Unities. - At the very least, I know it'll be a pain for me to find my Unity on the app, unless there's a way to rename my Unity which I'm unaware off.

Am hoping that the Unity could implement something similar to the METR modules.

this can potentially be implemented in every BLE module - even the HM10 modules can be set to require pairing with a pin code (I set some of them up that way for work) - I just find it funny that nobody cared and now they do.

I’ve had the same issue, and yes when the wheel rolls back on full release. The spring is strong enough to rotate back beyond zero. (Creating braking, or acceleration depending on the rotation). It’s really a mechanical issue, not software. My solution was to run my remote in reverse. It allows, atleast for me, better control of the wheel, and have yet to have a slip. Hopefully that helps.

You have to push the board hard and fast and long. I need to go at least 3 meters and pushing as hard as I can. I find it much easier to push the board by itself without me standing on it, because I can get the board to go fast enough without having to move my own mass.

When this first released Months ago I had the same reaction too , then I thought of it as a developer. The software side has labor and a price too. And since it’s digital work there’s less materials to based it price upon and more so labor , time R&D/Testing of said software. So if they felt that the time taken to develop Endless Ride and the other modes are the price they want, then I’m not mad at them for offering a model that strips these features and offer it as such.

Can I go more on both?  What about positive 60 negative 60?

Yes you can increase your max brake current to -60. I would go lower on the max regen brake current -15 regen brakes and -60 max brake current makes my motors skid. Increasing max regen current might not be healthy for your battery.

Giving it a second thought, is your remote in R-Spec mode? 
Usually your settings must have both accel and braking plenty. In normal mode you get up to speed but accel and braking feels dull.

Sorry for being repetitive, but I was wondering..

If Unity has 14AWG phase wires, replacing the motors with 14AWG will cause no issues, in theory, right?

They are dual 6374 168kV SK3s that are going to be fed by a 12S6P 30Q battery (90-120A continuous).

As I am not willing to void the Unity warranty, I wonder if it's even logical to fit 12AWG on the motors.

Yeah thermally 14 will be fine. Obviously bigger is better for less losses since resistance of wire scales with length, but you really won't lose much. Can just use an online calculator to compute resistance and compare to your total winding resistance to see how big of an impact it will have.

Here is one piece of feedback I have about the way this programming seems to be set up, and a question about it's tune-ability. 

When going from throttle to zero throttle, the transition is so fast I almost pitch off the front of the board.  I noticed between the boosted v1 and v2 they smoothed that transition up a bit.  Is that possible on this current 2.1 Unity setup?  Can it be looked into?

On a gear reduced motor you'd be able to over power the motors on deceleration, so I'd imagine the non geared DD motors would give much more resistance at 1:1, so I think some coding is needed to smooth that out a bit.

[quote="drangboards, post:1960, topic:64944"]
When going from throttle to zero throttle, the transition is so fast I almost pitch off the front of the board. I noticed between the boosted v1 and v2 they smoothed that transition up a bit. Is that possible on this current 2.1 Unity setup? Can it be looked into?
[/quote]

I have experienced this behavior on every single VESC based board I ever tried. On VESC 4.12, Focboxes, belt or hub. So I agree with you that must be a software thing. Boosted smooths this jerk effect and makes the ride much more user friendly, in my opinion.

Please report back if the new firmware really fixes the issue for you, like Carl said.

New FW doesn't effect throttle response. The parameter you looking to tweak is called ramping time, if you download the full tool its under app settings -> ppm

Indeed the behaviour is still there from full throttle to 0 (not brake engaged) the transition is too strong. I compensate by slowing the throttle releasing, but would be nice if it gets smoother.

If you're looking for a smoothed response turn these two values higher:

![image|690x401](upload://4uTtoLYFLCLWqyopjyaCpXxkPDC.png) 

 The compromise is your board becomes less responsive since it can no longer respond to throttle changes as quickly.

Correct. Essentially it means it will take 0.1 seconds to go from max throttle input to 0 throttle input. If you were at say 25% throttle it would take 0.025 to go to 0 if set to 0.1 as is default.

Ok I updated the firmware.  My settings are like 90 and 30 milliseconds, so maybe this is moved down from previous.  I'll ride it before needing to change anything, however maybe I'm not seeing things as they are because now the old focbox utility gives me this error when I connect to make the PPM changes.

The accel power is mostly determined by the Motor Current Max and the Battery Current Max.

On the raptor 2.0 with dual focbox these could be set to 80 motor max and 40 battery max as maximum. The Battery Current Max Regen was capped at -12 which mostly affects braking at high speed. Now with the Unity -30 is said to be safe by Bara. The Motor Current Max Brake was at arround -65 for me. I could skidd my wheels with that at slower speeds so never bothered to test the max number there.

Now for the Unity Bara advised me:
> 80 to the motors is a bit high. Normally, 60 is the highest I would recommend.
> 
> I would also do 60 from the battery if you want.

So I would try 60 motor and 60 battery to improvee accel. What are your values right now?

Side note, what is everyone using for your throttle curves?  

Here's what I'm about to try out.  (going up from 10% on both.)

I got pitched off the front of the board during braking last night with a full backpack on, so figuring out how to use more throttle input to do less stopping.

 This is what I use for a throttle curve on stock, or VESC firmware. I use -20%/-20% normal on @Ackmaniac firmware. 

It has a better implementation of throttle curves than stock firmware which is why I mentioned it.

Btw, which of these axis is for input and which is for output? Axis titles would be nice to have in the tool.
As @billappleton mentioned it makes quite a difference if the curve is "backwards" and without titles it's an easy mistake.

@chris201  no it isn't necessary, a lot of prime run 2 focboxes. However, the device is a wonderfully crafted piece of art and the ability to jump on my phone and wirelessly program the board mid ride is fantastic. The compact size really helps with looks and/or stealthiness. I highly recommend getting it. The price  difference is negligible.

You don't have to! No one said you need to. @chris201 asked about F-Box Vs Unity when I remember correctly.... Again, it is all in the software, not the hardware. Configuration is a software solution and with the new VESC-Tool you can configure multiple linked ESC with a minimum of clicks, just like a single unit.
And it doesn't even mater from whom you bought the units. Just plug in a dongle and that's it.

Actually I'm not sure if I did that time.  I have the board set to stay on for 60 minutes, so I have to power it down and back up again if I want to turn the controller off. (am I understanding that correctly?)  It did seem like it was going straight to 100% under braking.

Since the new release of the 2019 VESC-Tool app it doesn't doesn't matter how many devices you put in an array. You can configure them all in one hit with 5 clicks only.

Yes you can.
The convenience of configuration is not in the Hardware! It is all software based. 
Focbox UI is build upon the Open source VESC-Tool app and is modified to purely work with the Unity. It is a hardware specific version with modified user interface. 
If you go for Unity, Focbox UI will be your app.
If you go for twin Focbox, 2019 VESC-Tool will be your app. 

Both apps will let you configure your board with ease and on the fly via phone. Functionality varies a bit. 

What I want to say is: Whatever hardware you decide to buy, software and app wise you will be sorted.

ok thanks :) i have the normal focbox with the vesc tool app in my raptor 2. but i have a problem. in april this year in germany are e-skateboarding legal. but only with 20km/h topspeed. :(  it would be nice when the speed is always on 20km/h when i turn the board off, for the police ;) and when i turn it on and go in the app for make it faster with a few buttons. is this possible?
thanks

Yes, you can ad a permanent profile, that is limited to 20km/h. On power-up you board will always choose that profile. Since you can ad gearing and wheel parameters, you can define top speed in the profile by simply entering the desired top speed. You can also limit the wattage in the profiles. Drop those questions here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/all-new-2019-vesc-tool-release/83619
This thread is Unity specific. VESC-Tool questions are better placed into the VESC-Tool thread.

I joined the new preorder for the unity and the remote. Since ive never built a board before i had a couple of simple questions. Does the battery protection negate the use of a BMS for a 12s battery pack? What about a bluetooth or wireless bluetooth module, is it designed to be an all in one ESC, or are the features better bypassed in-leiu of these separate additions? Space is limited on my build so planning around the size of this ESC and my battery are key for success.

Hello,
i want to change the days my current set up to a foc box unity... but i still have to think about the erpm limit... with vesc 4.xx i was able to set 60.000, so does unity work? or how does it work? May not kill the box immediately.
I built in a 12s Lipo battery and 2 motors with 2000kv each ( 3,2 kW )
Would like to run every motor with 70-80A each... 
Power of the problem concerning the erpm limit? 

Best regards Flo

@boostem You will still need a BMS, you can use a charge-only bms which should be smaller. 

@Flo091 60 kerpm is easily handled by the unity. We have tested up to 130 kerpm without any failure. The unity will give your board the power it needs.

@mackann 

I'm sorry if I'm annoying...  what did you say about your settings again?

1. max battery discharge 
2. max braking (battery)
3. max motor  
4. max braking (motor)
etc...

You can then make quite a lot of settings.  I'm so insecure because I don't want to ruin anything :p

@CarlCollins Is there any sort of bluetooth protection against someone else connecting to my Unity while I'm rolling down the street? I had to change the acceleration curve the other day and my friend had an Android (I only have iPhone) so I used his phone to tweak my board and it got me wondering if it's possible for others to do malicious things to a rider of a Unity? I know Bird scooters and other M365 scooters have come under fire lately about bluetooth attacks and I'm wondering what Enertion's position is? Is there a secure setting I don't know about?

Hi @CarlCollins, I placed a preorder on Dec 30th for a Unity which, I think, had a quoted February delivery date at that time. I ordered it without the warranty package. I saw while browsing today that the 1 yr warranty is being offered for a discount (~35usd) and messaged the live chat customer service to try and get it tacked on. He said that it would not be possible and that I would need to order the standalone warranty SKU which is about 70USD. He also said that he could not generate a discount code. I then asked if I could cancel the original order to place a new order with the warranty, to which he said I would both lose my queue position (understandable) and be hit with a 20 pct cancellation fee (not at all understandable since the item has a) not shipped and b) is now delayed.) 

Is there some way that I can purchase an extended warranty at the current discounted price without incurring a penalty? Thanks!

If I'm not mistaken, it's not delayed, the told that will be shipped after feb, never gave a exact date, but as you say, I wouldn't see a problem, on they adding you the extra, but when I saw that they offer 1yr warranty for a little I was like "I'm to stupid, I need this"

It is probably because Enertion has already used the money to put the next group of unity into production. This time of year there is always a delay from the Chinese factories because of the Chinese New Year and the factories shut down for several weeks. So now they are all starting to ramp back up.

EDIT:  I made a mistake... all is well.    I was actually charged $313.56 USD on Jan 6th (that includes the 1 year warranty and shipping), went and checked my card statement.   Apologies, I am really excited about getting my FocBox and was checking the order status and got really confused b/t what I saw on the product page, and what I saw on my order status page which was in AUD, not USD.  My Mistake!!!  Sorry Enertion :blush: 

Original complaint below, which is unfounded...
------- 

I pre-ordered FocBox Unity on Jan 6 2019, and the price was $399 USD.  The order status as of right now is "awaiting fufillment".  Fine, its a pre-order, it takes time, and I dont really need until Spring arrive here since snow is all over my town.  Of course I'd like to get started on my build, but I can be patient...

BUT, I just went to the Enertion site and right now the FocBox Unity is on sale for $243.95 !!  It says on the website "Pre-Order Now | 3rd batch shipping after March".

WTF!!!!!  Why did I even pre-order?  I assumed I was getting the best deal possible.  More than a little ticked off about this Enertion, I really feel you owe me a refund of $155.05.  You shouldn't be selling pre-orders on top of pre-orders for cheaper when the first pre-orders haven't even shipped.

They definitely had a price decrease from 11/9/18 and 2/15/19 of about 48.80 AUD, I can send you my invoices if you want in PM, but I’ll just twiddle my thumbs and wait patiently and try not to start another build while they get their orders together and finalize the second batch shipping. It’ll get shipped eventually, I just hope they don’t push the shipping to after March....

Currently I'm using METR but when I used it, it changed all the settings and the hubs crashed into my computer so I took the module off.  I'm not sure what the module is because it's unlabeled

It made the amps to high I think, they shook like crazy at speed

And here’s a link to the enertion newsletter dated 12/5/18 which is after my first order stating you guys still had 50 left for first batch pre-order. But it doesn’t show that it was 50 left for non-US orders...

You did, just patiently, impatiently waiting for both of my tracking numbers. Just trying to figure out where I’m at in the, “we process orders as placed, in order,” but people who ordered after me are already getting tracking numbers again... 

I’m guessing these second batch orders who ordered after the first batch deadline that are getting tracking numbers are not located in the US?

**2: US customers with having Unity and NANO-X (or any additional parts) on their orders.**

Because additional part stock is only available in China

We bulk shipped US (Unity orders only) to our US agent, so you guys will have speedy delivery with no custom taxes (possibly).

PS: I am pretty much sure that you guys will receive the item near to when non-US will get their item delivered.

It's just a good item. Dual ESC's are scary in general because I suppose if one side shits out you're left with a half working item. That's always a concern. From a redundancy standpoint it's weaker sure, but it's a risk I'm willing to take myself.

The quality of product, design thought that went in to it and general support for it so far makes it a damn good purchase for me personally.

It might not matter if you are running fairly small motors, but I prefer the bigger ones just because the conductive contact patch is bigger so you don't risk heating.

then I see beginning of March. then March. Then I see orders with other things will be shipped befor unity’s on there own. Then tracking numbered last Monday to Europe.
Now I’m seeing ordered from several months later arriving even the ones delayed to USA going thro resellers arriving.
Contacted customer support for a second time toled shipped next Monday presume that’s the default response. So now wating untill Monday on the next excuse......... obviously some things holding them up but no idea what’s happaning still.

It would be nice if there was transparency and equality in how logistics was handled for all orders. I have a horrible feeling that my order # was bypassed for some reason & all Unity stock gone, hope I’m wrong.

Only difference is maybe the focboxes also bought.

Anyone else in same boat? Unity/focbox combo order, awaiting fulfillment

I cannot wait until mid to late summer for a Unity, so will have to bail on this order if that’s the case and either use some focboxes I already have or a scalper Unity or ...

Careful, cutting unity wires voids warranty. Much easier to just make adapters. They wouldn't sell a product with connectors that can't handle standard battery load. 

A 3.5mm male bullet just so happens to perfectly slide into a 5.5mm female bullet. 

Apply shrink wrap and revel in the professional adapter you must made!

I didn't understand the last part. 
but the male connectors that the motors (bkb 6354) are bigger that the unity ones, but I think the same as you, that the unity ones should be better and it would be better to void the warranty on the motor than the one of the unity and the extended one XD

Voiding someone's warranty just because he replaced a connector is plain ridiculous.  
In EU, that would be considered illegal as the actual failure must have been caused by the modification.
And even then, they can not void your warranty, just refuse the particular case.

Enertion is definitelly not playing a fair game there.

Yes. Take the back side of a male 3.5mm bullet connector (what plugs into unity) and the back side of a 5.5mm female bullet connector (what motors plug in to). They fit eachother perfectly. See below

Solder them together and put a tiny bit of shrink wrap around the connection. Do this 5 more times.

There is a likelihood of not insulating the new bullets correctly and damaging the ESC with a phase short, or making a cold solder joint and clogging up the support system with self-induced problems.

A diy connector is easy like @venom121212 shows.

For the connector a dual walled adhesive heat shrink gets my vote for durability, make sure not the tiniest gap is present, I believe they can arc even without completely touching

The same can happen with your own reduction.  
Also, my Unity's connectors were not properly insulated, there were exposed parts of the connectors.  Fortunatelly, these are far apart in my encloser so it should be fine.

And to be honest, I personally can't see a reason to replace these 3.5mm bullets, they are normally used in RC for constant 50A connections, more than enough for esk8 use.

Yeah not sure what app that is so don't know how logging is... It generally means absolute maximum. Is that motor amps displayed or battery amps? Remember motor amps can exceed battery amps since the driver acts as a 3-phase inverter (can do like 60 amps at 0.5 duty cycle and only pull 30 amps from battery). This is not an issue with the unity I'd say it might be a display issue or something of the sort.

Edit: sorry reading quickly, just saw that it was your BMS measurement app. Yeah not really sure how it measuring but a transient 60 amps spike with a 50 amp limit seems feasible. Battery amps is back calculated from motor draw so there is some uncertainty there in general.

I got my Unity really quickly, very glad about that.

Today I test fitted it on to my board and noticed that the heat shrink for one of the bullet connectors was not shrunk. Out of curiosity I pulled it off and couldn't help but notice the awful looking solder job on the bullet connector. After seeing that I would like to check the other connectors as well.

Do I lose any warranty if I
1. Check the other connectors
2. Fix the bad one(s) by resoldering them?

I haven't tested the functionality of this Unity yet.

I'm intrigued by this BMS you are using. you mind sharing a link.

you seem to have a "discharge over-current times" setting, to which i assume it's the time that an over current  needs to be sustained in order to trigger a fault. Having that setting to 1 sec or more will help prevent any false positives.

   I realize that you probably field these questions quite often, and I tried to sort through most of this thread to find an answer, but do you know a shipping date for order #25359? It was placed on March 2nd, 2019.
   Also, I first tried to order the FOCBOX Unity and a Nano-X controller on February 27th, 2019, but there was a hiccup somewhere in the checkout process. (issue was most likely caused on my end, and enertion was more than helpful resolving it)
   I'm not complaining either way, but am wondering if it will be in the 2nd or 3rd batch? or if it is in the 3rd, is there anyway you can bump it into the 2nd?
   Thanks in advance.

Almost all EU 2nd batch orders are shipped and many of them got delivered already. Same situation is with US orders.

Some of the orders like Alan’s will take a little longer.

I got my Unity really quickly, very glad about that.

Today I test fitted it on to my board and noticed that the heat shrink for one of the bullet connectors was not shrunk. Out of curiosity I pulled it off and couldn’t help but notice the awful looking solder job on the bullet connector. After seeing that I would like to check the other connectors as well.

Do I lose any warranty if I

1. Check the other connectors
2. Fix the bad one(s) by resoldering them?

I haven’t tested the functionality of this Unity yet.

Even though it might survive your "tug test" to me it definitely looks like something that could fail under the vibrations our boards go through in use. Also it looks like a cold solder joint IRL.

I'm not asking anyone to do anything about it, I want and can fix it myself. The question is if I'm allowed to.

This is one of the reasons I went for the platinum warranty.
I want to be able to solder whatever connectors I want.

I mean most RC type esc does not even come with connectors. Voiding a warranty just for replacing the connectors is plain wrong.

It is very easy to determine if an esc defect was caused by changing connectors or not so this particular intervention should not void a warranty.

It would just brake as normal. In most cases you won't regen enough power to damage anything. If you live at the top of a mountain and the first thing you do is go downhill 3 miles or something it might be worth investing in a charger with controllable max voltage.

There is a setting (max input voltage) which by default is set to 57V but if turned down would cut regen/cut power if that was desired behaviour, but I don't think that's good for an eskate. Also if you use a charge/discharge BMS it's possible that could also cut power independent from the unity if you run up against it's hardware limits.

Agreed, I have a rheostatic brake installed to prevent over recharge but I don't think I could ever recharge more power than I've used getting to that point. Unless you start at the top of a mountain and brake the whole way down, I don't feel the R-brake is necessary.

Sometimes I do like to taxi on my neighbors' golf carts for extended periods of time though :smiling_imp:

I agree with the general idea that actually damaging a battery with this kind of overcharge would be difficult to do. As you point out, the real danger is if someone is using a BMS that will cut power on overcharge. I and many others don't use discharge BMS for exactly these kinds of reasons.

Unless I am mistaken I am sure power to esc goes from the battery directly but the power from the esc goes through the bms first then to the battery. 

Is that also not the reason why we say bypassed for discharge. Any charge is still handled by the bms or my wiring is wrong. 

![image|666x500](upload://yEMOfw4uSXxZGe2a2IGKv375eTI.jpeg) 

As you can see any charge will go to the bms (negative lead black) and discharge goes straight to esc (positive lead red).

Gonna completely bypass it now and finally add a charge port which is still missing. Then the bms will only be connected from battery to bms to charge port. And battery straight to esc. 

Thank you. 

I was sure I had it wired correctly like this. 
Now I am also wondering how the hell this bms has handled all my brake amps this whole time. 

I’m using this one.

Also why is your d140 so different from mine which I bought from @Grozniy

Yours seems to have 5A as max charge and discharge current. The discharge is irrelevant in our application, so as long as you keep your charging currents at or below 5A you should be golden.

I think mine is the 15A version but I have thrown away the packaging, I have another one at home unopened I will check.

Looks like your bms is rated for 60A discharge, so it possibly would be ok not to bypass for discharge?

As for brake amps, it’s unlikely braking regen current would exceed the rated charge current for most bms I think. 

The issue for a discharge only bms is overcharging - so for example riding a fully charged board down a steep hill with full brakes... there’s a possibility the battery will exceed its capacity because there is no bms to switch off the current once the battery reaches max voltage.

I have a 60A bms, but I have bypassed it cos I trust the unity to handle max discharge and I reckon the braking regen overcharge thing is a bit of a red herring. Just to be sure I always ride uphill first when my board is fully charged. That’s easy cos I have a steep driveway to get onto the street from my house.

The voltmeter cost 15 usd, then cables, cable protection and jst connection  + shipment and you are probably over that price and still need to do the work and have a solder station.

No need for you or anyone to buy it, I just added it because ppl was asking about them and i already sold 6.

In the box next to it you can adjust manually, it's pretty easy to spin a wheel exactly ten times. The number there just represents (gear ratio * motor pole pairs) I have faith that everyone can read one sentence follow instructions and count to ten, in what way is that more difficult than understanding how gear reductions/motor poles work?

I understand that it is traditionally done differently in other apps, but my guess is many had to have someone explain that to them when they first used it also. I'm going to strongly disagree that the suggested method is more foolproof. We outline  a calibration routine to accurately measure the reduction vs. blindly trusting user input that rely's on some level of understanding of how drive train works.

That's why Ackmaniac's WATT control is superior to anything. YOu get the full response of your throttle. ALways If you apply more power it gives you more power. YOu don't reach max speed with 1/3 of throttle applied. WATT control is awesome but I asked Enertion and was told I am the only one that wants it. That's why I am staying so far with Focboxes and Ackmaniac's awesome FW.  BTW, ramping time adjustment is in PC VESC tool APP SETTINGS/ PPM - general tab (positive ramping time for throttle, negative for brake, lower down to make the response quicker)

The reason why it is 10 turns is to reduce the impact of a slight error. I recommend picking a unique feature on your wheel or placing a piece of colored tape when you do it. Say you were 1/4 turn off from accurate, the computed ratio would be +- 2.5% inaccurate.

It's just cumulative which averages automatically. Basically we are just looking for a conversion between tachometer counts/6 (electrical revolutions) to mechanical revolutions. So log the Tachometer position at beginning, hand spin 10 turns then back calculate.

You're thinking of duty cycle control. Watt control doesn't give you a 1:1 mapping of speed to throttle and 1/3 throttle will still send your wheels to max speed under lighter loads.

It does affect the granular controls at high speed giving more responsiveness in the throttle past a certain duty cycle. Though the effect isn't as night and day as with duty cycle vs current.

Additionally the Unity firmware is based off the official VESC tool which already implements watt control, so you guys actually already have it.

Original VESC firmware doesn't have watt control. Only ackmaniac fw has watt control. You are right, you are still able to reach full speed without giving it full throttle but the point is it is more precise and you can give your motors less amps while accelerating. ALso you can always give it more throttle and you know it's gonna kick in. With amp control you over-do it more at the beginning and then have to let go off the gas more. When accelerating and letting go you don't know exactly at which position the throttle is going to go in neutral. Again with watts this is way more minor. Not mentioning, as you say, at high speeds like over 45 km/h anything other than super precise becomes dangerous. Once I switched fw from ackmaniac to regular and almost crashed coming through an intersection at 52 km/h. Purely because of changing the ackmaniac fw for regular and getting the "neutral" position a few tens of a second after let go off the throttle at 52 km/h... It's for those going really fast and needing the most precision one can get. Others will not care really...

I'm well versed in ackmaniacs software. It's the only one I use and have been using it since its initial release. I'm not sure if things changed recently, but official firmware, at least at some point, did use watt control.

I have no idea what the unity is doing behind the scenes... all I can say ACK watt mode feels better, more natural to me. I guess thats just a matter of getting used to but if you run one board with the unitiy and another with ACK watt mode its not that easy to handle... in combination with a new remote (maytech v2) its not really inspiring confidence (feels like the brakes are only working after 2/3rds of levers throw)

Late braking in higher speeds is caused by your "battery current max regen" being too low I would suppose... That's what it controls... battery max regen for break in higher speeds, motor min for braking in loer speeds. Also lower ramping time for braking If you need quicker response.  I see you are using nano... I suggest ditch that crap, get yourself a pistol remote like the Alien power system one. Nano remote is one of the worst remotes for any higher powered boards, just like any other cheap crappy thumb controlled remote. That's not an opinion, that's a fact, that remote is so bad... People that try out a normal pistol remote cannot believe how much better their board becomes because of that...

The difference of control between chinese thumb thottle remotes and a pistol like, especially those big RC ones is so big it can't be described. This really is a fact. And once you try a high powered board with nano like remote vs pistol like RC or so, you will see what I mean. You have obviously never tried.  They shouldn't be allowed to sell thumb remotes with high powered boards... (Guess why owner of E-toxx, Trampa, all the big boys... all use the same big RC remote for their high powered builds :) Trust me, it's not a matter of preference...

Try to take it as me being happy and just giving you what I know, then it might not look like I am being rude... cause it's all just in your head.  All I am saying RC remotes pistol like vastly superior for precision control and an absolute must for a high powered board. If you don't see it that way you don't ride high power boards and don't use high power. Simple as that. AS an example I am giving names like Trampa, E-toxx etc... You wanna argue with them go ahead.

Man, that is not an opinion. I am not saying it feels better to use pistol control for everyone. You get used to whatever you get used to. I am just saying the travel a precision in RC remotes is much more greater. That is not an opinion, have a look at the mechanism, the length of the travel. That's how it is. Last guy riding with only 40 amps per motor on the ENertion drive gave me big "HEIL" after I persuaded him to try out the APS remote. He is now on 70 amps per motor riding way faster and accelerating fater than ever before. Happy as a little kid... I am done ranting, sorry.

More travel throw doesn't mean greater precision, this is entirely why both types of remotes exist; because it's completely subjective to how people like to control their board. I like thumb remotes, I like short throws, both are **my** preference. You're not gonna be able to prove my own preference wrong.

Le me ask you this. How much power do you use in your board? I have never heard anyone saying I want less precision... Unless you are riding slow boards where you just go full throttle when you wanna go... I am also not saying every single pistol like remote on the planet must be more precise than every single thumb remote but in 99 percent of cases it is the case. I don't know any bad pistol like remotes.. .I don't know any good thumb remotes... Have you ever tried using nano with 3000w+ of power while riding with cars up to 57 km/h? You can't for long, cause you will die. You need a precise control and big travel, that's the last thing thumb remotes have... Would you lend a 3000w+ board with a nano to a 10 year old kid? Only If you wanted to kill him, with RC remote you can.

I just got mine yesterday.

Much better in my opinion - just looks a little rough 😂. Definitely wish the throw was longer like on the other remotes, but it’ll have to do for now.

I'm having a weird issue.  

When I connect to the Unity via it's Android app to monitor real-time current values, it always gets stuck after a few seconds ( looses connection ) and I have to manually press disconnect and then connect again. Tried 4 phones, always the same problem.  

It seems to be related to throttle input - when the board is idle, everything is fine, connection is stable but once I push on the throttle stick, it looses connection and gets stuck at whatever values it measured last. It's very inconsistent. Sometimes, 1-2 fast bursts ( full throttle ) is enough to kill the connection, other times even slow motor movement over period of time will kill it.

I'm talking about bench tests here ( so no actual load, but accelarating/braking while the board is loaded causes the connection to break too ). Power source is not an issue ( 10S4P 30Q / 8S 5Ah 45C LiPo ).  
Any idea what could be causing that/how to fix it? Other than that, the ESC works fine.

Yeah, think it has something to do with noise passed to the module somehow. The module has a ferrite bead between the ground plane but maybe more isolation is needed is what I have been thinking. High current spikes seem to cause momentary disconnect which can cause a buffer overflow. The patch fixes this so it reconnects smoothly. 

I have designed out a new module with additional isolation to test and an independent voltage regulator. Should help us track down the issue. I'll let you guys know when I know more. Luckily it still works for the most part as is and is a modular component if a swap fixes the issue.

I'm running the latest FW from Enertion on my Unity, however there is a lost feature I loved from my dual FocBox with @ackmaniac FW, when braking coming to a dead stop you lifted the trigger and brake again to go reverse.

Is this feature hidden somewhere on the Enertion Android app?

I think this is the [special sauce ](https://github.com/Ackmaniac/bldc/blob/master/applications/app_ppm.c#L383) that does that, and unity FW has no equivalent code right now in the [same place](https://github.com/EnertionBoards/bldc/blob/unity/applications/app_ppm.c#L197). It looks reasonably contained and could be ported over.

I got the 1 year warranty. Might be a bit off but pretty sure I was told by support that I could swap connectors without ruining the warranty because I have the 1 year warranty. Pretty sure that means I can also swap the 14awg to 12 or 10awg without ruining the warranty.

It's a long time ago I know, but just thought I would say it anyway.

I have just been in contact with support and was told that I can **ONLY** swap the **XT-60** without ruining the warranty. Changing bullet connectors, wires, etc. will void it.

I don't even know anymore what can be done or not...

Well mostly to prevent a potential fire if a cell becomes unbalanced on discharge... I guess the risk is small but not one I like the sound of. But I'm no expert if you have a good rationale as to why it's a bad idea I'm keen to learn more? Sure it's a "point of failure" but how often do these things actually fail? I never had a problem with my Evolve stock one until I wired the battery to it wrong and blew it up...

Unbalanced cells on discharge is extremely rare. Unbalanced to the point of causing a problem is even rarer. Causing a fire? Almost unheard of. Fires are caused during charge or by short circuits.

Discharge BMS are useful where there is a good chance that the parts of the circuit that could pull current when the battery is already discharged. I would trust a VESC to not do that. For instance, in a 10s setup: If you have the VESC cutout under 32V, the chance of a cell being under 3.1V is very very unlikely. My 10s5p pack has no balancing and after ~100 cycles is still within 2mV, and I think it was worse than that to begin with.

Of course this calculation might change if you are using a bunch of recycled cells with unknown origin with all different capacities etc. Then again, I wouldn't use that kind of pack in an eSkate.

For me it's a risk analysis. What are the relative likelyhoods and risks of things happening and what is the consequence.

* VESC/FOCBOX fail open - low -  loss of brakes, possible injury
* VESC fail short - very low - wheel/s lock, likely injury
* BMS fail open - low - loss of brakes, possibly injury
* Battery unbalance causing fire during discharge - extremely low - board is on fire - loss of brakes

you get the idea. If you don't use a BMS and/or fuse, you can get rid of a few failure modes.

But why??

We know delays are the LAST thing you want to hear about when you're hanging out to receive the latest tech from us - but when we find ways to improve our products, we want you to benefit immediately.

Our engineers have been busy investigating several reported faults experienced by our DIY-users who used the Unity with higher-powered motors and batteries.

We have already released a firmware update to address these issues and after additional testing and feedback from our users, have determined that the firmware patch successfully solved the issue. During this process, we also identified several ways in which our test jigs could be improved to more stringently test every unit we ship out. This testing requires a complete redesign of our custom jig equipment at a component-based level, which is complex, and needs time to be developed and implemented.

Although our production batch was so close to completion, we needed to send each Unity back through our product test line a second time in order to ensure that these updates could be applied. While this does cut in to our delivery timeline, we are determined to continue to deliver the most reliable and easy-to-use motor controller available today.

Just confusing! There is probably something else along with this problem. You got those reports of failure, you had unities in stock using the same Firmware and hardware.Once the software problem is detected, addressing it doesn't necessarily mean through every single Unity in your stock (updates and testing can be over just a couple of units if not one, since they all use the same hardware. Of course except if the problem is also hardware, where you will have actual components to swap). Once testing successful, the same firmware is then applied to the whole stock, which can take just a day depending of workers and procedure. But here I'm!🤷‍♂️ Mach, april, may, june, and now july. OOhh probably half of july then august on so on. And my Board rusting.

I'm still excited for the Focbox Unity, and understand delays happen when producing a quality product, but is there an option to be refunded for the amount originally purchased if it doesn't ship out by the end of July? Or is that possible to do now? I would happily re-order at the full price once everything has caught back up.

Its fine to make and sell your own ESC based on the VESC or UNITY/FOCBOX so long as : 
 - You also release any files you make that are derived from the vesc source files with the same opensource licence.
 - You dont use the name "VESC" as this is a trademark that Vedder holds the right use. You can call it watever you like and say that its derived from the VESC but you cant call it a VESC.

It is VESC based.

According to [VESC ETHOS](https://vesc-project.com/Ethos) *"For this reason the code of VESC-Tool and the VESC firmware are published under the GPL V3."*

I were able to DIY recreate the exact same pcb as the focbox unity

This might be difficult because although the Vesc software, firmware and schematics are available they haven't released the hardware designs. This is specifically to stop exact copies and encourage people designing their own to do there own hardware designs.

So any reports of it happening after the newest update are wrong?  I've seen a few people mention problems post update so I'm just a bit nervous about it.  These kinds of problems are obviously a nightmare for any rider and the new Lacroix I have on order is going to be running the Unity.  Seeing as that board can hit 45mph, I'm pretty scared of any issues, let alone an ESC one that could lock the board up at these speeds (and apparently doesn't show until you are 35+, which is terrifying in its own way).

For battery level indicator on skateboard, voltage is just ideal to show battery level. It is proportional to capacity anyway! If the app uses the battery capacity you entered to estimate remaining juice, it will be very inaccurate for most cases because the real capacity of batteries are always different from advertised (slightly lower or higher) and it keeps going down as time goes. If your battery sags to the point where the app tells you a very low level while you still got juice, your battery has low C rating or you got bad cells in it.

No it isn't. Under load the battery voltage will fluctuate wildly. All modern electronics use fuel gauge type battery capacity monitoring NOT battery voltage.

@Deodand Have you experimented with the PWM frequency? I know the default value is 20000 and it can be raised to 30000 to reduce motor noise but I want to add motor noise by reducing it to say 10000. 

Just wanted to consult the expert before I do anything dumb. Thanks a bunch.

Not sure why you'd want to hear angry bees but yes it can be done. Efficiency at 10k should be lower (less switching losses but more ripple current), I wouldn't recommend going below 15k since it also slows the control loop speed so if you hit high erpm you lose the sinusoidal wave form.

I really appreciate the response! After getting hit by a car I was wondering if I could get more noise to promote my presence without switching drivetrains or to unsensored. I have sensored Meepo hubs so they are pretty damn quiet and I do like that. 

I tried 12k and it sounded really... different. 15k was pretty good but had a little hiccup on full stop. 18k caused bad stuttering/grinding noise on one motor. I abandoned the idea and actually set it to 25k and it's a silent powerhouse now. 

Thanks again for the input :slight_smile:

Not sure what you mean regarding 81 suppliers offering the item? We only recently set up the Alibaba platform, as we're now in the position where we can accept orders from B2B clients as well as B2C.

We are extremely excited by the fact that we'll be receiving several hundred Unity today so we can get the next batch of shipments underway (we'll post photos and a short update as soon as they've been received,) and the fact that by the end of August, we'll not only have sent out all our Unity orders, but also have Unity in stock.

Hi @Skunk ,

That's a great question. We certainly have identified risks that could manifest into problems under scale, but we've also created new testing jigs to ensure that in-depth testing can be done efficiently and accurately prior to shipment, even on orders of high magnitude. In regards to sub-components and IQC, since we have been manufacturing Unity in it's current form now for quite some time, our factory uses the strictest processes to ensure that all our Unity are of the highest quality possible leaving the production line.

@CarlCollins do you have some sort of link for the adapter that goes to the remote (unity to remote receiver)? I lost one of mine. I talked to Adrian and he said it was a jst-ph 5 pin. I’m pretty sure they are 3 pin and even if I could find that online I need the mm size. I have a 3pin of the same type but the connector is too small.

So last week my unity suddenly stopped working. It was working fine till i lost a wheel while riding. The next day after that i replaced the wheel and wanted to try it out. It worked fine while the board was on it's back/top (grip tape side) but when i wanted to start riding the board it suddenly stopped working. Now when i press the power button nothing happens. I have 39V on the power leads so that's not the problem.
It's a DIY board and i made the purchase just over 60 days ago at my local store so i can't send it back. I don't know what to check first. 

* Amps battery: 60A
* Amps regen: 20A
* Amps motor max: 60A
I think there were no issues at all with my battery or motors and the unity is really the problem/cause here.

It could be just the switch if you're lucky. Do you have pust to start enabled? Give it a few good kicks and see if it powers up?

Nah i jumpwired the switch but it didn't help either. Push to start is enabled but never worked. Maybe i didn't try hard enough. I'll try that as soon as i'm able to.

They are much less sensitive than other push to starts I’ve had. I can hand turn a wheel half way and start my others. The unity I actually have to ride like 10 feet to get it on

Anyone could answer these questions regarding setting up dual unity for 4wd would be greatly appreciated. I have never worked with unity or foxboxes so excuse the amateurish questions. I have browsed various build threads and these are leftover questions I still have.

1. To trigger the slave unity to turn on via canbus, I have read about putting a resistor in line with the 5v rail. I have seen suggested values of 5-10ohm and also 20ohm. Is there any conclusive resistance that works better? Related to this: anything special on the canbus p + n lines? Should gnd be connected too or left open? Also, does the latest firmwares already send shutdown to the slave unity as well?

2. In setting up the unitys, does the master unity transfer settings such as throttle curves, motor settings etc to the slave, or should the 2 unitys be set up separately then connected? I'm sure this might be obvious as I'm setting them up, but if anyone knows the answer already, it would save me a hecking time.

3. Any special tips I should be aware of or is it all straightforward? Thanks!

1. We use 4,7 ohm 1W and it works good
2. No, you need to setup both
3. Nothing special, just remember put same settings on both except master/slave on them and ppm (if you use ppm remote) on the master and disable on slave

Thanks for the info! Could you tell me if your gnd line is connected on canbus? I just happen to see on another thread that it was not, but both unity would be grounded to the same battery so not sure if it matters to pull the gnd wire or not.

hey Jeff @Deodand, hoping you can help me out on getting a problem I'm having diagnosed and fixed quickly.... I have 2 unitys and both of them are having a couple of little issues. On the first one with the more prominent issues I keep getting a DRV error when riding and it's very scary and has almost through me on my face a handful of times now. I've included the metr info below so just lmk if there is anything else I can provide to help with your diagnosis and what I need to do to get it fixed. I still always pass motor detection fine with no-fault or errors, then when I ride and usually when I am accelerating the board will do a quick (sketchy) cut out but the board doesn't turn off or anything and will star acceleration after I let off the pass and then push the throttle again.

Do your motor detection values match eachother or is one way off? Look at resistance, inductance, and flux linkage measurements and the hall sensor values if running sensored. 

You should get results similar to this

![image|666x500](upload://1h4sMgr2nbdgHzJD57r1IOAqLfH.jpeg) Yeah I do get similar values as yours... I actually did grab a pic of those settings too on the last motor detection I did a day or two ago and figured it'd be helpful in figuring out the issue I hope, and that's also the other issue I forgot to mention on this unity and that is that the hall sensor plugs don't seem to be working at all and Im pretty sure it's the unity cause when I try those same motors on my other unity or 2 focboxes (or different motors on this unity) they all seem to works just fine except when plugged into this unity... so i know it's not the motors or adapters causing it obviously right? Are there any other test or steps I can take to see what else might be happening?

Also, after searching around for the DRV8301 on here and esk8news and I see a handful of different reasons this fault could come up, do any of you guys know, or can you explain, what this DRV fault is caused from a little more/better to me or is it just to vast at this point without more analysis....? Thanks very much guys @venom121212 @rpasichnyk Welcome your thoughts too @Deodand

There is a component soldered on each VESC that is called DRVxxxx. It's a gate driver and used for controlling the motor. When you often get DRV faults you need to replace this component. Is is very tricky, but there are people on this forum who do VESC repair and may help you.

Foc box question. Rape me If im being in the wrong section.

I don’t know shit about the trim feature but I tried it both ways up/down and it didn’t help.

Before I changed my app settings in each of the 4 focboxes and had just done a normal motors plugged in through a 4-way ppm split to the nano, noncan bus. The strange thing is, first thing I didn’t was just switch the receiver and a few wheels worked without even changing vesc settings.

Changed the first focbox in line as a normal direct to receiver (others were still on the splitnbutnhad and settings) it seemed to be working up until I hit wrote pulsewidth values. Then when I would re-enable the motors to spin and test the remote, the focbox I just set up but won’t spin wheels. When I full throttle the display of pulsewidth percent shoes it rise to the highest value I allowed, but the %bar stays at 50% and the wheels don’t move. I’ve tried avoiding split ppm and different setups with the same result. I know the recover adapters on the foc box work, because other Meuse the display wouldn’t show the pulsewidth travel to the high value unrer the display pulsewidth spot. So it’s getting signal, it’s jut no longer wanting to work or sees the max and min pulsewidth stuck at 50% somehow.

Btw when I would test a wheel like this out of the other 3, if a other foc box that I had yet to have altered settings from, and the remote was plugged into the ppm line, the motor would work. Under up with any new setting. As soon as I’d update the setting for what I need, it goes back to the same issue.
 Maybe an Enertion questions.....but can you answer this year @carlcollins066. I’ll try Hoyt as well

![image|666x500](upload://bLFKWnjlChbXiaUjYkyyhSlxdqU.jpeg) 

For example full throttle ton2.01 will read that on the display but stay at 50% and not move wheels. I just want two can buses together focboxes with a split
Ppm to share the Hoyt remote.

I don't believe I understand. The reverse button, you mean? To be fair, when I bought it I was under the impression that's all I would be missing if running in PPM. Regardless, I am very happy with the remote as is but I would be interested in what you have to say.

@ Carl, 
Some ideas to improve, for the next generation of FocBox unity, It could be great to include 4x connectors with 2x pin each, in order to power 2x front light (withe) and rear (red) lights. Then for the rear light, to ride more safely, it could be possible to adapt the level of light (stronger) when we use the brake to inform the riders behind, than we are braking. Also, the level of lights could adapted by software/app or include in the remote, to have different level of light, (as Shredlight) depending light conditions (light ot black night) I thank you for your fantastic developpment, your attention and your great help in skateboard community. I thank you for your help and support. Friendly. (sorry for my bad english :-) )

From doing a little bit of research and also getting the VESC6 version, the JST connector changes depending on hardware. VESC4 uses a 7pin UART connection where the VESC6 uses an 8pin.

I modified my VESC6 connecter by shaving away some of the plastic and rearranging the pins and it works flawlessly. 

I would say try the VESC4 version, otherwise the PPM adapter that came with your UNITY will make it work regardless.

The benefit of UART is that you don't really have to calibrate the remote inputs, it all should be plug and play for the most part. You just have to set settings on your UI accordingly.

It got to the point where I don't even connect to my unity with the unity app as I worry it might change my settings or fuck it up in some way. Connection losses, some stuff not saving like custom cut off voltages. Frequent recalibrations cause you stop for a beer and after you turn your board back on the motors are jerking. It's all just software, some bugs have been fixed over time but many remain. Though it's just literally patience issue. I use metr module for unity and the METR app and everything is fine :)  The main thing is unity won't turn off or let you down, it won't throw you into a ditch like Evolve. Dealing with things that just take patience is something I can deal with. Even though I sometimes bitch about Enertion, I love their products (except for their remote:)

So i just rechecked my unity and found a burn mark in the switch connector on the board. The resistor near it seems fine.
![20191015_205124|374x500](upload://stjJRQiCI3qxzh0q3Rl7H6FGA5p.jpeg) 
I also checked the resistors and measured them with my multimeter (cause i first thought it were fuses). If i measure the one with the red circle my multimeter beeps but if i measure the other ones (blue) it doesn't beep. Which ones should i replace? They are 0,001ohm which is less than the minimum my multimeter can measure.![20191015_205317|374x500](upload://7onFYGrS9tH40OxYsmb2kq6YBl0.jpeg) 

Anyone knows what caused the burn and broke my board? I contacted Enertion last week and marked it "Critical" but they don't seem to take customer support seriously. Still haven't got an answer.

I did remove one post with that guy text spamming a repair agent, but only because his phone number was exposed. The OP reposted it with the number censored and that one i let stay.

My power switch broke and I'm not quite sure if I could use any powerswitch I want. Or do I have to pay attention to the voltage and amperage.

Hi, were you ever able to get your battery display working with the Unity? I have the same issue with a nearly identical display.

You can use 1 Battery for both.

You need a Canbus cable to connect the two Unities

No, they will both draw from your battery when using a parallel connection.

otherwise I've done a bit of youtube research about this, but I'm still not certain where to exactly solder the wires.

here's a guide with the exact product

did you see my post about the battery display? I'm starting to think I just splice it directly to the battery.

and that's a shame about enertion, but fr they should haved employed more/better/responsive customer service

You should be able to plug it into the 2 pin "aux" JST. I haven't personally tried it, so no guarantees, but IIRC that's what that AUX port is for -- a switched and fused connection to battery for a voltmeter.

so in laymans terms your saying fusing it directly to the battery will work but otherwise making a connector would probably work, right?

sorry im a pleb lol

You can wire it to the battery but it'll always be on unless you add a switch. The reason Unity has that port is because ih has a built in switch.

Btw by "fuse" I mean blow if there's a problem.
