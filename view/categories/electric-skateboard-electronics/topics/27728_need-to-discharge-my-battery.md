Hey all,

I have a weird question.  My board is currently unable to be ridden for mechanical reasons, however, I have a full battery.  I need a safe way to discharge my battery to around 40% while I'm waiting on new parts.  Is it safe to leave the throttle on "motors spinning only" to discharge the battery down from about 90% to 40%?  Is there a better way to discharge my battery safely?

Much appreciated.  Thanks.

You can get high power resistors they are big and can dissipate heat very well. What battery do you have?

Leaving them at 90% is fine, you could also hook them up to a light bulb to discharge, or if you have a balance charger, you can likely use it to discharge

Oh yeah, forgot about things like light bulb or pretty much any DC powered device with the right voltage :D
