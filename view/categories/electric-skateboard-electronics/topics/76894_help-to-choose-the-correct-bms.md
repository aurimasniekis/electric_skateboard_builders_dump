Hi there community,
I am planning to build a 12s8p battery with Sony vt6 Li ion cells to use use focbox and 6374mm 150 kV motors. 
I am not sure of the amperage of the BMS I should use. Can you please help me out? 
Thx heaps!
and sorry for the noob question which is probably covered somewhere I could not find.

you can run a charge only bms so that the battery isn't limited.

*please* do some reading, 39min is not enough
