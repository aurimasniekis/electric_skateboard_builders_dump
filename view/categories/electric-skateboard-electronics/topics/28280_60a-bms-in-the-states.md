For my 12s4p setup this is the BMS I'm going with...

http://www.ebay.com/itm/44V-48V-50-4V-12S-60A-Lithium-ion-Li-ion-LiPo-Li-Polymer-Battery-BMS-PCB-System-/221644780045

The only ones I can find ship from China. Is there any source in the US that I can buy these directly from?

Thanks in advance...

Here is the original site where those BMSs come from... I am not sure if they ship from the US though.
