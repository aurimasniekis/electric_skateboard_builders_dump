I am planning a new build and i want all in one battery pack (switch,indicator,  bms charging port included). The TORQUE offers thoses battery packs. 

Anybody who uses them can you tell how reliable those battery packs are? 

Are there any other options for battery packs except TORQUE‚Äôs?

I have a 12s3p lg he2 pack from torqueboards that I bought in 2015. It‚Äôs still going strong. I‚Äôm sure the capacity has dropped a bit, but it works as it should. Also I have another 12s4p 30q pack from there I bought second hand, but unused. I tore it down to reconfigure it. All I can say is it was built well and i‚Äôm reusing all the components. 

To add to the list in the previous post Miami Electric Boards has packs too. I don‚Äôt have any experience with them, but also haven‚Äôt heard anything bad either.

Good luck üëç
