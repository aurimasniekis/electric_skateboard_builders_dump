Greetings!

I was wondering about this for a while now.

I am going to mount my motors in the rear, so outside of the board.

Default SK3 cables are just phase windings and they are quite hard to bend, so I presume they would eventually snap, not necessarily all of it, but some windings over time from steering movements, vibrations, etc.

What would be a better idea:

Cut the phases, leaving only 3-4cm, soldering flexible silicone wire to that.

or

Just adding bullet adapters with flexible wiring in between motors and the controller after somehow fixing the phases stationary?

The first is better, but make sure to do them at slightly different lengths to keep the bulk to a minimum

Pretty much like all electrical wiring, so that the bend keeps constant cable length and I can add the Nylon sleeve easier?

Bullets works too I have done both, but I prefer the full silicone as it‚Äôs a lot more flexible and the full length bends equally. Either is fine really

Cutting the wires is a pain, but is worth it IMO.

The windings still have the laquer on them all the way until the end where their banana plugs are soldered.

You have a few options to remove it. Some kind of solvent would be best. You can send them (each strand, individually). Or you can melt it away by repeatedly trying to solder it and hopefully make good contact. I don't recommend the last option despite it working well enough for me.

@murloc992 you need to get the coating of the phase windings for a good solder. i recommend a fine sandpaper to do it.

Thanks for all the suggestions guys! I will for sure go with the flexible silicone wire route. Yet I think it will void the heck of my warranty.. I will coat my windings so I guess that's the least of my "voiding" issue. :smiley:

Maybe some of you who have taken SK3s apart, know how to properly deal with the 4 tiny screws on the can? 3 unscrewed no problem, 1 is quite damaged but I am glad it did unscrew.. They seem to be screwed as hard as it gets and not damaging them is like 50/50 chance.

Are there better replacements or something?

They have Loctite on them you can tell by either a blue or white residue on the screw. You must heat them up before unscrewing. Make sure to replace the damaged one now

Seems to be M2.5 6mm screws. Tiny as heck. :smiley:

What kind of wire diameter should I aim after I cut the wires off the motor?

Would 2.5sq. mm work? Seems to only take 36A by the specs.. But I guess 36A per phase is 108A total so no dice I will ever reach that. :smiley:

Sadly those two posts don't emphasize on soldering temperature and length of the cut..

So to continue my topic:

How do I prevent enamel melt from soldering if I want to do a "butt joint"?

Do I aim a blower fan at the wire?

I do have leaded solder both 70/30 and 66/34, but my sacrificial motor still gets molten enamel deeper down the wire.

Another option I am consider, offered by my colleague:

Solid copper crimp.

You take a copper tube for crimping, just the right size to perform a butt joint, smush the wires together inside of that and crimp the heck out of it, causing a pressure weld between the copper strands, but leaving me with some nasty copper cylinders.. 

I mean it's kind of the same as a butt joint, but safer for the enamel..? Maybe not as a reliable?

Waiting for opinions/experience. :slight_smile:

Typically you'd clamp on something to sink the heat if you don't want it to travel past a certain point. Like this:

https://www.amazon.com/Amplified_Parts-Heat-Sink/dp/B009VNUZYS/

But the wires are so beefy and there's so much heat. Maybe mini locking pliers? No idea if this would be effective at all.

And of course a hot iron with a huge tip, in and out quickly (do as I say not as I do lol).

This can be good but you have to get it perfect. With meaty thick wires and very tight access I don't know how you'd get a proper gastight crimp.

I figured to put some copper plates and a blower fan directed at the place I don't want heat.. but.. these windings transfer heat in a flash, literally. Heatshrink that is there originally saves the heat in windings from cooling down so hard I can't even.. This explains why original connectors have at least 5cm of solid wire that is definitely melted together right after them from soldering..

For gastight crimping, I think I'd have the space necessary, but it would mean leaving more original wire in crimping tube length intervals, I mean it's still better than the original non bendy cable..

Need people with experience asap. :smiley:

What wattage is your iron?

Trust me, if it's around 50 you'd have to TRY to melt the stuff further down the line.

Just give the shortened enamel wires an initial tinning, tin your silicone wires, and then solder them together. With the wire sinking heat from both ends you're going to be fine.

Are you using 12 guage or 10 guage?

My iron is 150W, sharp tip. Adjustable up to 460'C.

My wires are in fact 14AWG.

What temperature should I aim for?

Maybe I didn't clean the enamel well enough or something on my sacrificial motor, as soldering took me at least 10 seconds while feeding inhumane amounts of solder into the joint. Pre tinning sounds like a good idea, but this kind of avoids the butt joint idea being flush.

Prone to breaking. 

I think the best option would be to evenly splay your stranded wire, around .75" of uninsulated, evenly 'encase' the solid core wire with it, then with a sturdy yet flexible enough piece of other wire, tightly wrap the joint and then solder, making sure the entire assembly properly wets.

But that's the "butt joint" I was talking about all this time. :slight_smile:

I think I will attempt airtight crimping, somebody has to try it, for science!

Will grab some 1.5sq.mm/2.5sq.mm heat insulating(glue) tinned copper crimp tubes and get to work with crimping pliers. Best case scenario - it works and I didn't have to heat anything up much. Worst case scenario - I can still solder to what's left.

Hmm. Either you're not visualizing what I said correctly or one of us has a misunderstanding of what a butt joint is.

By soldered butt joint, I thought you mean placing two faced ends together, aka 'butting them together' . You would have a tinned end of your solid wire, a tinned end of your stranded wire, and melt those two ends into one, on the flat circular plane of each. Which would lead to having a flaccid weiner like something.

What I advised to do is a bit more mechanically secure. Technically you're still something close to butting a part of it, but by no means would it be a flush cylindrical connection

I think we're talking about the same thing. I just call it a "butt joint". A spliced, pushed through each other cable join that is wrapped around with a strand of copper wire and then flooded. :smiley:

Like in this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t9nT3Hn9b0

This causes my back to shiver though, because the enamel will NOT survive after I shorten the original winding cables and attempt to flood the new connection so well that it shines throughout.

Okay, we're at least on the same page of the quality/process of the joint. I actually think this video is where I learned how haha.

I think the confusion just lies in terminology.

When I think butt joint, like, you have a butt connector with an ID that goes over your wires of presumably a similar OD and then crimp it over. The process of the two ends touching together is the 'butting' aspect. 

So when you talked about soldering it, I just thought you were going to strictly attach the 'end to end' almost as the 'side to side's in this video would be.

But anyways - crimping might be a great idea if you can get a small piece of piping to go over them. I have the cheap yellow China 16 ton for $40 crimpers that flood Amazon for my 00 welding wire and it turns joints into solid fuckin copper


p.s. I've also been up for way too fuckin long maybe I'm dickin up

For the love of skatan I can't get my wire ends clean enough to solder without messing up the windings inside the motor. I am running out of sacrificial motor cable length. I will need to remove the enamel either way, solder or crimp..

I tried to use a sharp xacto knife, sandpaper, acetone, none cut it(get it..) to a degree I want without causing my further down strands to heat to 180+'C which in turn melts internal enamel and will definitely cause either extreme stiffness or shorts.

Any better ideas on how to(home conditions preferably)?

I doubt it. Maybe I could just try and heat through it when I sand off some of the enamel, just wonder how sensitive the windings are on SK3s.. Yet on my sacrificial motor I have seen winding temperature of 180'C, gradually creeping down inside the motor and staying at 90'C there. Stuff's creepy..

Also - you can take a pair of needle nose or other pliers(or any metal clamp) and affix them to the wire down the line if there's still enough slack to act as a heatsink so the internal wires don't get as hot.

With last lengths of wire I've found two major tricks.

Cleaning the "enamel" which is apparently some sort of polyurethane (250'C+ melt point) takes just thin pliers with ridges and fanning out the cables.

Flux. Lots of flux. Flux the CRAP out of the motor cables and keep conservative at the silicone ones as that puppy will absorb ALL the solder QUICK.

Anyways, I will try the real deal soon. I have one motor to pop I guess.. :smiley:

In the end I just went on with crimping, because none of my soldering attempts did it. Mind you, a professional at his field tried it and said that the copper in the windings transfers heat too fast and basically soldering will not form a "legit" joint unless you burn a lot of enamel in the process. Always a cold/semi cold joint if you go without melting the enamel or stiffening the windings from heat. This explains the 4-5 centimeters of solid solder wicked windings at the bullet connectors at these motors originally:
![21|690x388](upload://lSSOmQJSEEemlbwpsToyRC8uBRB.jpeg) 

I used tinned copper ferrules and had to remove their plastic housings(I couldn't find the uninsulated version to buy). They fit 12AWG and the windings perfectly with space for wire butting left. I also used the crimps on the budget just for that kind of crimping:
![10|690x388](upload://nGM6WFx8oTWtVljUj7etQInNPct.jpeg) 

These leave a square crimp with ridges and pretty much push all the air out and compresses the cables to insane contact. :smiley: 

I cut windings after motor disassembly to leave ~1cm of uncut winding after the bend, then stripped 5mm of the windings:
![44|690x388](upload://9TIsYdp71KW4RdNrRj9GDZHyb10.jpeg) 

Scraped the enamel(very tedious with so little windings, but doable):
![50|690x388](upload://diSPvkQTiKuIJkDFmPQ5De1eRjK.jpeg) 

Pushed the 12AWG into the ferrule, pushed them together onto motor winding part with as much force as possible as it allows the cables to go into each other, then crimped the HECK out of them, creating a solid joint:
![00|690x388](upload://sKQmRxtHW78IO8XpANA94msnAwR.jpeg)

The end result:
![47|690x388](upload://CGjMCbLxCmSNy7ZeCPYO7NDEyB.jpeg) ![04|690x388](upload://6knYUoZ4oDfEthssi0B4NsCcZv6.jpeg) ![11|690x388](upload://dRepkEO2r9VGHjDn8XIN1LQbCQZ.jpeg) 

This one is my semi-sacrificial motor. A little bit beat up, but it's going with a VESC with 4(4.5?,5?)mm bullets. The standard SK3 ones which I just salvaged from original cables I cut. :slight_smile: 

The same procedure will be used for my Unity motors. Hope it helps anybody who searches!

Later I might add a little bit more pictures showing more of the process to this post.

Cheers!

Nice!! Very difficult work, having a similar experience myself, but much longer phase leads to work with. I'd love to see the motor IR measurements (maybe even a before/after?) when you get around to configuring your esc settings! Persistence is the only thing that can get through wire enamel apparently, there really isn't a shortcut.

Crap, I feel outdated. I don't know exactly what I'm looking at there; Why does motor 2 show 35545mOhms? Am I misinterpreting? Stupid Unity and it's fancy streamlined readouts. So jealous, but so set in my ways. I digress- the left half of your screenshot makes sense to me, but the other side... IDK  

On a side note, as per @deucesdown 's suggestion, The only way I've been able to penetrate (lol) the enamel on my mto6880 phases is with a solder pot. A 150W, no temp control, hot as a mother f*cker, solder pot. Having read your post sufficiently to reply here @murloc992 , I know that the pot would not work for you due to the length of your phases and the thermals of copper. 

Anyways, looking at the above data, I either don't have a clue what I'm seeing, or that's a thousand times higher resistance..? Am I an idiot, or what? What does the red mean? Thanks for the (potentially misunderstood) data!!

So that means you have a sound and reliable electrical connection I hope? It would be amazing to know if crimping were a viable solution to this!

I was literally ordered to crimp the connections by people who work with all sorts of electronics for more than 20 years. They say if you do it properly, you get a gastight(airtight) "weld" of copper from the pressure.

Heck, I even tried to crimp a phase lead without removing enamel and I still got continuity, I do not recommend doing this ofc, but the pressure is enough to make it(the enamel) shatter. :smiley:
