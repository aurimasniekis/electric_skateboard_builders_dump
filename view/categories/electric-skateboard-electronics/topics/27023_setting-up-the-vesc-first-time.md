hi guys, first time builder and i want to avoid any mistakes so please tell me if im going to destroy something.
i got the vesc and 6374 motor from DIYes, and my battery is 10s3p with 25r cells (60amp discharge, 7.5 ah).
before i do anything with the vesc, i intend to remove the xt90 connector on the vesc and solder the battery's discharge wires directly to the vesc's wires. (the battery will have a switch).
and i will be configuring the vesc with this 10s battery (the guy on the diyes website said its okay but some people said its not).
any help would be much appreciated :slight_smile:
