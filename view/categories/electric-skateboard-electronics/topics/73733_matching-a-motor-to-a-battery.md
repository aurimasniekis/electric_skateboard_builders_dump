Let's say I have a battery capable of delivery 60A at 36v and a motor which recommends up to 10s (36v) and boasts up to 3000w. Is my battery gonna be insufficient or at least a bottleneck.

My logic being: battery provides (60*36) 2160W which is 800 shy of what the motor can handle. Or is this not a big deal? Or does it not work like that?

Plug your battery info along with your gearing and motor here:

This should give you a pretty acurate estimate
