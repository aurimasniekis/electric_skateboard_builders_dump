Hello members of the wonderful esk8 community,

I came back recently from a long study abroad which I sadly could not bring my electric board with me. When I came home, I realized that the charger for my battery (Enertion Space Cell Pro4) was missing, and I haven't been able to find it anywhere. I really don't want to spend the $90-some dollars to order a new one from their website. Is there anyone out there with advice as to whether I should just suck it up and spend the money on a new charger, or if I could go a more DIY route and hook up a different way to charge up my board? 

Thanks in advance!
