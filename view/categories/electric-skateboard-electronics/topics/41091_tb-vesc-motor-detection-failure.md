This is my first build. Enertion big boy motor TB VESC and 6S LIPO. Watched the vids on set up. Changed the parameters for my batteries, everything went well until I did a motor detection, nothing happened and got motor detection failed, no error code. Did a search on the forum to try to find some trouble shoot info. How do I figure out if it's the motor or the VESC?

Am no expert, but am going to prepare you for when someone who does,to have your information already laid out, Post/say , what firmware of BLC TOOL? where you download it from. what are your blc settings (post them), picture of build (maybe faulty phase wire loose or there touching)

I would try a different battery, different motor if you have them. Like @Exiledd_Top said, post screen shots of the BLDC tab so we can what settings you are running.

Make sure to set your cutoff start/end settings since your using a 6S Lipo.

ok, thanks for any/all input. Please see complete information attached. This stuff is all brand new but almost 1 year old. I had issues creating enclosures and work got busy so it got set aside for awhile. I finally got enclosures done and just purchased cable so I could connect the VESC to my PC and configure. I am using XT60 anti-spark for both anti-spark key and to connect my wiring harness to VESC. Batteries (6S) charge and discharge no problem. Just get a flashing red LED when I connect to BLDC. I adjusted the battery cut off settings and the braking regen strength but nothing else. I want to figure out if the VESC is the problem or the motor. I would bet VESC before motor but need to confirm. Give me a list of things to try. I might send the VESC back to Dexter and ask him to check it for me and see if he gets the same result. I hope I did not waste 100 bucks on a bad VESC.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/5/854441bc8424e5b65301b263d4444a14aafda455.jpg" width="690" height="419"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/1/b13dab04ace555485f354791292bc1cfbf70e595.jpg" width="690" height="417"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/e/9ec82d19031aca059e5609305fdeed20c91827f4.jpg" width="690" height="414"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/8/f83d32dae9464e4d1ad4ed769ea559c678bf4ce2.jpg" width="690" height="415"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/1/711cbc5dee4266ff9b5ad8e78a90855482218eb3.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/8/a8eb244f944bab000480fab01e5b282eaff3fd1c.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/2/0212e9c1caa5a82369295213bf8cc6894fa1f76e.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/2/b232b56d5519e09623a70159a51d5190ef47946f.jpg" width="281" height="500">
