OK.  Testing a VESC 4.12 that I replaced the DRV chip on.  Detects motor fine, but there is some interesting behaviour, namely that there is a significant stutter and kick to the beginning of the motor detection process.

Otherwise motor appears to work fine with keyboard - FW/REV Fast/Slow no problem or stutter.  Also, no faults registered

The Setup:
DIYES VESC 4.12
6374 190KV motor
12V 7Ah Lead acid battery
BLDC Mode

Your lead acid batt does not have the punch required.

Here's the video of the first VESC that I fixed - no problems.

But did it pass the motor detection ?

Also, can you try the first one again with the motor mount on the trucks.
