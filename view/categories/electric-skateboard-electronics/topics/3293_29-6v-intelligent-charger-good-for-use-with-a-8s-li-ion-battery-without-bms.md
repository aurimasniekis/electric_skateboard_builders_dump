Hey guys so I saw this listing on [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/221896637604) of the intelligent li-ion battery charger that supposedly charges up to 8S li-ion/lipo. Does anyone have any experience with this smart charger? Would it balance charge the cells or does it just charge it up to the max battery voltage?

It does not balance. You would need a balance charger or a bms (battery management system). If you had a bms, then you could use this charger.
