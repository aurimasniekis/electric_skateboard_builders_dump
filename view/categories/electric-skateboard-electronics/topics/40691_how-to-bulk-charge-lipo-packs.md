If you are an irresponsible person do not try this. Please close the page and read another thread.

Bulk charging is a safe proccess as long as you keep some rules:

-You must balance your pack every few charges, 1 out of 5 at least. I used to balance my packs once every two charges. Do not delay it.

-Test your pack. You must know how disbalanced it is before trying bulk charge.
If you notice some cell is way disbalanced than the rest remove that brick. Do not risk it.

-Never leave the charge unattended. 

-Charge it to a reasonable level. 4.2v is the full charge voltage. Since lipo is an unstable chemistry it gets disbalanced pretty quick. That's why we must charge a little lower. That way we will never overcharge the cells.
4.10-4.15 is the usual voltage. Do not go above 4.15v it's not worth the risk.

-You will lose some range. If you need 12000mah buy at least 15000mah. 
Besides...the bricks will lose some capacity over time.

-Do not try this if you are irresponsible. I mean it. I bulk charged hundreds of times without any problem at all but you can really start a fire if you risk it too much. Respect lipo.

-Last but not least, charge it in a safe place. Where a flame is not a real danger. Charging the pack inside a fireproof lipo bag is highly recommended. Have a fire extinguisher and a smoke detector around. They are quite cheap.

I don't mean to scare you with all those rules. Bulk charge is not dangerous itself. Your attitude is. Play safe and you will have no problems. If you are not experienced with lipo i do not recommend you the bulk charge.

Benefits of bulk charging:
You can charge huge packs very fast.
You can carry small tweaked power supplies to charge at the job,school etc.. some sellers set the output voltage by demand. There's also some portable solutions. 

Shopping:

[http://www.chargery.com/](http://www.chargery.com/)  you can find very good variable power supplies there. They are also big and expensive.

[http://www.ebikes.ca/product-info/cycle-satiator.html ](http://www.ebikes.ca/product-info/cycle-satiator.html ) this is the best choice. It is small,light,portable,waterproof,efficient and variable. You can easily set voltage and amps. It is quite expensive but totally worth it.

Drok 0-60v Poor man's choice. It works fine. The wattage is overrated. Set low amps because they have been reported to fail pretty quick if you use it at its max power.

Drok 10-120 The same as above, just more voltage.

You can also ask some vendors to set lower output voltage for you. Many of them will do it.

Are you running lipo batteries? If they are wired individually, you should use a RC hobby charger and parallel board. 

I balance charge every single time. Don't do it less often if you have the capability to balance. Non balanced charging is the number one cause or battery fires.

I would never recommend bulk charging Lipos.
It is much better to use a bms with multiple Lipos so that they are balanced with every charge.
Then you don't have to worry about fully charging them safely.

As an electrical engineer I admire your ingenuity, I almost went down the same path as you until I discovered this 1080W (20 Amp per channel, adjustable) dual 6s balance charger. https://www.ebay.com/itm/SKYRC-PC1080-Dual-Channel-Battery-Balance-Charger-1080W-20A-for-6S-Battery/292265405172?hash=item440c602af4:g:p38AAOSwaopZklr2

Seriously though... wiring a BMS to LiPo is not even hard...

Like hell, this is as simple as it gets.

I have read many people at  endless-sphere.com  talk about this but nobody explained how, why and how to control the risks. Thank you

Actually there's many threads about it. Some moderators explained it thoroughly. I think ypedal even did a youtube video. But that was many years ago. I thought it was neccesary a thread about it in this forum because I see None and this is delicate.  Must be done with proper care or not done at all.
Nobody talks about it anymore because this is old fashion technique. We are quitting lipo. As a matter of fact this is my last lipo pack. As soon as it's done for I will weld a li ion pack.

How do you balance it? RC charger? Medics?

Battery medics are too slow. Besides you want a perfect balance  if you use bulk method. I have an icharger 4010 duo. It charges and balances at the same time. I have a harness and a parallel balance cable. It takes only a few seconds to plug everything. I don't know the rest of the guys at endless-sphere ...but I started doing this because it was very easy to charge my bike at the job. I had a small tweaked charger there. So I did charge/balance at home and bulk at the job. It is perfectly safe if you balance one out of five charges but I only need one out of two bulk charges.
By the way. ..i am not encouraging you or anyone else to do this. I am just explaining how to do it safe. If you are about to buy a new battery I recommend you li ion. Lipo is no longer the lightest, cheapest and best option.
