I have a VESC from diyelectricskateboards.com but I'm not why it won't work. 

So I tried hooking up my VESC to a battery and an SK3 motor. For some reason, it just keeps flashing red. The first time I did it, I was able to control the motor with my keys but after holding on to the keys for a while, it stopped working. Did I permanently break it?

I tried changing the battery cutoff and start to suggested values on other forums but I can't even seem to "upload" the data onto the VESC.

When I read the configuration, this is what pops up.

Type "faults" into the terminal and paste what you see here

Did you do the motor detection before you started pressing the keys to run the motor?

Yes! I did motor detection and then it started working then after pressing keys for a while to run the motor, suddenly it stopped working. I think I tried clicking apply and write configuration.

Here is a photo of my setup. It's a 12S2P battery. Would love to get advice for the parameters I should be putting in when I am able to do so though.

Oh no! Does that mean I need to buy a new VESC? How did I toast it? My bad. Would you all have tips on what parameters I should put on before I try running my VESC next time?

I'm assuming you're a US based person, so I'll point you towards @JohnnyMeduse ( the OG wizard) and @ThermalM16 (another option in the states)

These guys both do vesc repair, and will get you up and running for less than a new ESC üëç(if it's repairable)
