Hi guys im looking to try and make my Skatey 400 abit more portable and practical, its currently running on two 12v lead acids. Since i can only find 11.1v's on hobby king i'm wondering if the motor would be okay running on 22.2 v or will it run into overheating problems/premature death since its meant to run at 24v?
