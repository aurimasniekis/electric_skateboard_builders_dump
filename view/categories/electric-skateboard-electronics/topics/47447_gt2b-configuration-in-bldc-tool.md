So, I have been trying to configure my GT2B controller in the BLDC tool.  I set it so that the throttle trim is at 50% and then pulled the trigger and typed in the value and did the same for the brake.  But then when I write the configuration the value on the display jumps to like 65% and the throttle doesn't work, but when I push forwards the motor starts to spins up to full throttle.  I can't figure out what the perfect setting.  

I don't know if the images will help but those are what the pulse width ranges should be.

Two things: 1. On the bench(without load)the VESC will go full throttle with very little trigger. 2. You need to mess with the Max/Min pulse width settings until you are at 50% with no movement of the trigger.

Okay, so that's it?  I thought you had to pull the trigger to set the Max/Min?

there‚Äôs a switch on the gt2b called ‚Äúreverse throttle‚Äù or something like that. flip it

It only does that when I set the minimum pulse width below 1 ms though

The thing I described in my original post.  When I set the min below 1 ms the throttle stops working and when I push it forward (for the brake) it goes full throttle and doesn't stop unless I disconnect the battery.

Yeah, flip it then remove it. üòÄ

My very first esk8, a santa Cruz 30in bad hand double kick...I used a gt2b.  I built it, everything tested fine, jumped on it and hit the trigger.  

End result was me on my ass and the board 40 feet behind me.  I started working slower and learned the proper wheel roratiin after that.

I finally got a chance to try this.  I set the max and min limits and flipped the switch, but that didn't fix it.  The motor just starts going full throttle and doesn't stop unless I unplug it.
