Before I even started on my own electric skateboard, I was already hired by a aquantance to make a build for him. 

The goal: single drive board that can go up small hills, +20mph with 10 kilometer range. 

What I know: The VESC is a must have. Other electronics like batteries and outrunners  sold under the title "professional quality" like Enertion is overpriced like apple (unnecessary).

My question: What is the best motor/battery/TxRx combo on a tight budget?

[/quote]

Everyone says this until they own enertion stuff and realise they wasted so much time & money on the inferior gear...

the false economy will teach you all the lessons you need when it comes to building an exceptional eboard.

ALSO note, anything from the hobby store that is used for an esk8 and/or is modified is not covered under warranty. Unlike Enertion products that are designed for esk8 and have a warranty to match.

BULLSHIT 

The product is just capable of increased voltage and current  resulting in a higher output.

You are a crystal copy of apple. If I buy from you I am not paying for a product, but for a service: Warranty. 

Your motors are the same as any another motors sold on the internet, but if I'm a retard and fuck up somehow, I can manage to possibly (with some effort) abuse your warranty and get a free motor. 

There is NO false economy, only stupid people not knowing the limitations of electronics. If you can use simple arithmetic, you can find the tolerances and max load you can have on a part. I can calculate what is needed to preform a certain task and expend minimal resources so that task is accomplished. I can buy a prius and go drag racing and have fun, but will I win? probably not

Everyone says this in the early stages of their DIY Esk8 journey! Yeah, I agree it's people who haven't learned the limits yet. Have you learned the limits yet? how did you learn the limits? did you make some parts fail or just use arithmetic? Did these experiments have a cost associated to them? Or did you simply learn from other people's mistakes?

To answer the question, **the most cost-effective** solution is one the never fails or has zero cost to resolve after failure - this is rarley the cheapest option.

The biggest mistake people are most likely to make is under-estimating their requirements & under buying, this happens commonly when you are on a tight budget. 

Common Example:
*"I am trying to do this build as cheap as possible, so I'll buy the cheapest LIPO's because all batteries are the same"* 
This is a great example of the false economy. From experience you will learn that batteries are not all the same, the cheapest LIPOS tend to be a waste of money on eboards, especially if you tend to discharge them heavily which could happen from an inefficient drivetrain, they will swell up, they will go out of balance & the will last a short period compared to the more expensive stuff. So what is the most cost effective then? the battery that is cheap to buy but needs to be replaced frequently or the battery that last many many times longer because it has built in safety features and better chemistry? Simple arithmetic can work this out, so you can tell us all.

[quote="osod, post:7, topic:1906"]
Your motors are the same as any another motors sold on the internet,
[/quote]

This is a common belief, but it's fairly misguided! for example I assume you don't have any of my motors on hand?  So how can you actually say this statement without backing it up with data. Because If you wanted to test it you could, you can go and buy 5 or 6 different motors from the hobby store and test them all, you will soon realise they are not all equal. I could literally make the R-SPEC motors half as cheap, I could use smaller magnets, smaller stator, less copper, no water proofing treatments, no modified axle, cheap Chinese bearings, remove various parts, not use quality phase wire, use cheap motor windings that have enamel insulation not rated to tolerate heat, cheap glues and cheap stators made from 2nd rate steel. **Everything can be made cheaper it's just somethings shouldn't be.**

EZRun 150A ESC (Vesc is not a "must" at all ).
Multistar batteries (cheap and massive capacity) - 2 x 12Ah packs giving me 13 mile range
SK3 3634 245kv motor

28 miles per hour on the flats. 13 mile range. Been working fine since last summer

Extras: cheap eboard off ebay. 16 tooth pulley. (around £90 for the board and pulley)

I run both enertion and hobbey king type motors. I have a set of 5060 NTM Propdrives i've been using for almost two years in a dual configuration and i just bought another pair last week to replace them because i like how they feel on my 6S. I have another board with twin 6355 R-SPECS and those things are monsters. I also have an r-spec 245kv that's over two years old and is waiting for a smaller, lighter build.  I've tried Tacons and i like them too. I also like SK3s. 

what i like most about enertion motors is the keyway and ringclip grooves. They make it dead easy for builds. They also come with flexible silicone leads and have some design considerations for running fully exposed under a board. 

But you're going to pay for that value addition. Don't mind grinding flat spots for pulley bolts or dremelling out some ring clip grooves or replacing your stiff bullshit phase leads with nice silicone ones (i've done all of this)? then save $50 and get a motor from hobbey king. but if you have the money and don't mind spending it then its worth it when you consider the warranty and all of those other features together.

Cool calm and collected...yet again showing you are a class act person and business man.

He's on a budget... And seems to want to just get by....Till he truly gets the bug...He'll be calling again soon lol 

And at least he comparing you to Apple...a semi-compliment ....

To each their own on the DIY .... I bet there is a half a million ways till Tuesday to get a skateboard down the street with out pushing....

I don't have your r-spec because the 50mm motors are working for what I need...Maybe down the line....but in hindsite prob be as worth as the 50mm I get....I still have to go to a machine shop to get the keyway done.... And in the end..the difference in cost between yours and the ones I get.... $40-50 bucks..... Is that a lot? No.... But playing with tight bugets....that extra money could get you a cheap esc to finish up the project...

Don't even think NTMs are in his price range.....to eBay with him...lol

Who knows...that my even last him a while....and it could if you are really easy on the parts...which we all know a person cannot...I've gone through 3 motors myself lol 

Maybe if you and. Mini r spec that was 50mm 😜 Lol

I think @osod doesn't realize that you @onloop are your own customer that wants fine goods on your board...and through your own trial and error have found solutions to the issues that you have had ....by creating a motor, motor mount (I have both versions), and battery ..... things that make creating an electric skateboard easier and making the end product something that will kick ass....

@osod: (if you are able on eBay)

@torqueboards may have a bracket to fit your Paris trucks and pullys 
eBay- you can find a 270kv no name brushless motor with 8mm shaft around $40 also you can find 6s ESCs for around $40 and the remote control for abt the same - $40...
You will have to get or do it yourself a keyway for the motor shaft.  And lipos you can grab off eBay between 50-75 bucks that will get you at least 7miles on flat ground...

Good luck @osod ... Be kind to the folks on here...they are here to help (Even the Owners and workers of the e-board related companies here...You can check the previous threads)

Hope you post some pics or vids of your progress and best of luck👊🏻

Bells ring and they send for me when my name is mentioned! 

I was selling them for pretty much cost at 100$ each to suck people in but now 160$. But I don't sell singles so 320$ for 2

The cost of two mounts, two motors, two motor pulleys, two wheel pulleys, belts, and the two wheels is likely more.  Long term it'd be cheaper with hub motors for sure even if not up front as the only thing to replace is the rubber at 20$.  And bearings

Honestly, everyone who wants to use cheap parts, will fall into the false economy if they don't head the warnings. @onloop broke down in a video somewhere the difference between the r-spec and other motors, literally showing you the difference by opening the r-spec and other motors up. You can believe they are over priced, but it is really not.

Do you want a low quality bearing in your motor breaking when your riding 20+ mph down the street?

Trust me, its not fun...

@evoheyax - Do you even know what your talking about? lol

What motors have you even tried? You do know the changes are standard features for any other motor. They are still made within the same factories as other motors.

Even a crappy motor will last 3k miles. It's based upon if the rider actually knows how to use the motor properly.

You can take a high quality motor and burn it out.

My comparison of price above isn't really fair though as it's compared to two motors.  A single 63mm motor setup is cheaper.

Wow. I already felt that "premium" was a feeling not a number with these motors and this further educates me on that.  You pick it up and can feel the difference.  Except if you were to really feel the difference it would be heavier

Yesterday I read the peak was 100 amps. Wow. 

I appreciate the floppy wires but other than that...blue balancing goo, got it, epoxy on the stator, got it(but not everywhere luckily), magnet wire that does 180c, no big deal, especially since the temp of the magnets can get to isn't revealed. Shielded bearings aren't as protective as sealed but probably fine shielded,  the little ring to help position the magnets, got those,  machine tolerances?...such an empty video. 
This educational video doesn't educate you on crap. Pure sales hype to the point of dis-education.

I'm not saying you can't pick up these cheaper motors, and still get a functions, reliable board. The bearing is probably a bad argument, because yes, the bearing either way should not break. But its the same argument to be made with lipos. I have had no issues with lipos swelling and blowing up, others have. Some of the things he does may seem unnecessary, but you act like he is getting these motors dirt cheap and selling them for massive profits. @onloop has hinted that he pays more than $70 per motor himself, which would hint that his markup may be around 25%.

Where as I would be willing to bet apple has much higher markup than 25%.

I noticed the difference in his motors from the cheap china motors I used at first. The feel more solid, heavier, and had thinker wires. The china motors I used burned up, enertions did not. Did my settings contribute? Of course, but if you can't say there is no substantial difference except price.

Do we say all cars are the same quality? NO.

When I bought my subura, the understanding in the subura community is that their transmissions are the most durable on the market. You can't argue all transmissions are the same, as my sister bought a Toyota, and guess what, shes on her third transmission at 120k. I'm still on my first, and probably will for another 200k. Is there some luck to it? yes. But when parts are manufactured with more work, thus costing more money, you are less likely to have manufacturing defects that take time to show up.

What about hoverboards? Are they all the same?

Of course not. As much as I hate those things, it kinda sucks for the ones who actually are using good batteries, because their business is being destroyed by others who don't care what crap they put out.

The old saying "you get what you pay for" is true in our consumerist world where everyone wants everything as cheap as possible.

If they manufacture the motors correctly, the sk3 should work great (as it has for many). But you just need to be that unlucky 1 in some large number to have a defect that doesn't show up until it breaks.

 Instead of motor sellers coming up with a continuous max amp or wattage limit based on an ideal race in the Arctic they should just tell what temp the magnets can get to so people don't ruin their motors.   And If they claim a "peak" it's an even more empty statement...what does it mean..one second? 

Going off of what is actually revealed about these motors the best thing that can be said about them, for me, is the floppy wires and keyway already done.   Any claims at better performance or premium parts are only sales talk.

To some degree, that's true. I love my carvon, and in reality, yes, its a slower starter than a motor in satellite config, but it will kill most motors top speed. torque vs top speed, and all that video did was test torque. Let me race you around a track with my carvons, and I bet I'll win.

Speed is irrelevant. I can go 50kph getting towed buy a car on a long board same result. The real test as @onloop mentioned in a post was: can a board continuously do 30-40kph for about 10 kilometers.

My interests are not for me but for a customer who gave me an outline and because I know him personally I want to charge him the least amount of money possible (aka I'm not asking for $$$ for my labor).

You have experience building motors so I think you can understand why things cost more & how that all adds together to make a better motor that has a higher price. By making small 2-3% improvements on ten different things you get a 20-30% cost increase. 

**The question is where do you draw the line, my motors are not actually that expensive in comparison to some. There are some motors which cost nearly double but are half the size for fuck sake.**

EXAMPLE:
RCTIGER MOTOR - half the size, nearly double the price of R-SPEC 6355

----------


Here is a good exercise, ask yourself the opposite question. **What could I do to make motors cheaper?**

*I'll help you out with some answers*

***HOW TO MAKE CHEAPER MOTORS.***
1. Machine the body (& everything) with lower tolerances.
2. Use lower quality softer materials to decrease CNC machine time.
3. Use a smaller stator
4. Use less copper
5. Use smaller magnets and lower grade raw material
6. Use stators that don't have high-grade silicone steel. The best ones are normally imported from Japan
7. Don't custom make the stainless steel shaft allowing easy pulley installation
8. Don't add 5.5mm connectors
9. Don't add 1M of high strand count 12AWG silicone insulated wire
10. Don't pay to have the motors waterproof treated.
11. Remove certain parts and replace with glue
12. Pay unskilled employees to hand wind instead of investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in computer controlled winding machines.
13. Close down the QC department.
14. Use china grade bearings made with low tolerance.


If everyone thing above saved you just $0.50c per motor your motor would be much cheaper right? ALSO, If you didn't have to honor your warranty because it clearly states as soon as the product is modified or used in a manner that was not intended (aka esk8) the warranty is void.... you would do it right? who gives a fuck if the motor fails early? All these folks who have hobbyking motors dying on them mid ride don't tend to get replacements. DOA is different but once its installed kiss your warranty goodbye.

I am an innovator, I strive for perfection and I will not sacrifice quality to increase profits or to simply grab the low hanging fruit by claiming to be the cheapest, "the cheapest stuff possible" is what fucked the hoverboard market. 

So please everyone go and buy your motors and eboard parts at the hobby store... I'll be here ready for you when you need legit gear and want to build a board that is equal quality to what you get from mainstream brands like boosted boards.

FINALLY, to cap this rant off, I promise, when the economy of scale improves for my small business, then will I lower my prices making my premium gear more affordable whilst still having exceptional quality.

Also, if you didn't notice already the economy of scale is already in effect, R-SPEC 6355 now only costs $105USD when bundled with a mono mech kit.... [SEE HERE][1]

@Hummie some words of advice for you, make sure your hubs are exceptional quality & never fail!... because you are (were) essentially selling them at cost price, there's no buffer for servicing your warranty, it only needs approx 10% failure rate to cripple your business, draining your prototyping budget, stifling further development & forcing you to close your doors leaving your customers high & dry.... is this your hobby or a business?

You're entitled to not give specifics about what's inside and many sellers don't but when you start a forum so that people can understand how these things work people will ask especially when you claim them to be better.  When another fan starts telling us how great they are it comes up again. How bout just telling us what temp the magnets get to and how thin the stator laminations are.  That would say a lot and knowing the max temp would help a lot.   Saying things like tighter manufacturing tolerances is empty until you tell us what is tighter, the airgap is what? and the bearings are they press fit or slide?  Just saying your stuff is premium leaves us in the dark.  I think everyone likes your motors, in fact they'd all probably rather one than the Tacon, but your claims go over the top and they aren't backed up with real evidence.  The only thing that's clearly better is the motor leads are flexible and it's keywayed already.  The things you point to in the video: balancing blue epoxy, a placement holder for the magnets, insulating epoxy on the stator...these are all more than common.

Basically what I was implying. 
What I have gathered so far after additional research is that the SK3 6374 motoes are fine and are MUCH more cost effective at 37 volts that Enertion motors. I will use 168/192 KV motors on some old laptop batteries that are also cheap and solve the battery problem.

Just because a motor has all the extra warranties and fancy colors on it does not make it worth the extra $80-100. Plenty of people use smaller motors that the SK3s and are doing fine as long as they are smart and cautious. Thanks for the people who contributed with meaningful inputs that will save some money.

DUDE! honestly, I don't think this technical shit matters to anyone! Also, maybe people keep forgetting... I am just some dude who builds eboards in my garage... none of that shit means anything to me. It either works the way I want it to work or its shit. I am not running special tests on the bench or using advanced formulas. 

Please EVERYONE remember, I am not an engineer!... I couldn't give a fuck about any of that technical bullshit!
**I-build-ride-repeat-improve** you geeks spend way too much time arguing about pointless stuff sitting behind your desk...... more testing, more innovating! less bullshit.

*My development process is really, really complicated... are you ready?.. it's ground breaking! please sit down...* 

**I TEST STUFF IN THE REAL WORLD!** 
I kept buying & testing motors until I found ones that didn't fuck up when stressed, my 115kg mate rode them up a very steep hills over & over! I strapped weight to my back and rode up hills.. Simple stuff really.
I tested 43mm, than 50mm, than 63mm diameter
I bought from NTM, SK3, SAITE, EMP, ALIEN, plus a few others I can't even remember..

They were all shit, why? because they eventually failed. Something was not good enough to make them last. What was it? I have no idea? they just failed...

What I do know is that these R-SPEC motors are rock solid, they pass the test. They are big, well-built motors with a few nice added features, They also have some visually identifiable internal characteristics when compared to cheaper motors from the hobby store, maybe this is the difference maybe it isn't... but there is not some magic formula at work. They are just bigger & made better... it's really simple stuff. Bigger motors are generally just better.

Nothing I do in my garage is magic... I don't run some formulas and magically create a product...It's just that I have spent a lot of time & money looking for & testing for the best stuff available.

I am an innovator, I strive for perfection and I will not sacrifice quality to increase profits or to simply grab the low hanging fruit by claiming to be the cheapest, "the cheapest stuff possible"
[/quote]

As Osod has said there are, formulas and basic principles that can be manipulated to eliminate guess work....Which you are brushing off as not "real world".

I would like to quote a Mr. Gordon Ramsay:  "You are a busy idiot!"  

While you do not have the resources like HobbyKing to mass produce cheap reliable outrunners, there are things that are unnecessary.  Some things like water proofing, 5.5mm connectors, silicone wires. engraving, aesthetics ect are unnecessary. They bog down the price competition and will not be used by a majority of people. You said you always over engineer  by a lot. I would be running 5% under the max load than under %30-40. There is such a thing as "GOOD ENOUGH". 

[quote="onloop, post:53, topic:1906"]

[/quote]

Please elaborate. 
Is the expenditure of materials justified OR NOT? I feel you try to project the fear that hobby grade motors can fail on the upper end when the load is just so big. This is true, but a majority of people weigh under 80kg and dont ride above 35kph. This kind of relates to computers and how you can overclock a CPU or GPU at the expense of higher energy consumption/heat dispersion.I dont need to buy a $1000 graphics card, only  a $100 cooling system. 

While you intentions are good (making a idiot proof motor that can handle anything) sometimes people will want to sacrifice some performance for a cheaper product that can do the same thing at half the price. Your "development process" is just throw money at it and thus make it bigger. This works, but not for everyone.

Fortunately, there is no law forcing people to buy Enertion products... 

People can freely choose what they buy.

But, The OP has asked a legitimate question that I happen to be very passionate about **"what is most cost effective?"**

My argument is simple. Buy something that won't fail or has a legitimate warranty to replace it if it does fail. The OP is building his friend an esk8, so he needs to be honest with them and say ill build you a board but it won't have any warranty, then you can happily buy your stuff from hobby store.

As you can gather, I am passionate about this topic! This is because I have been there & done it, In the long run it cost me thousands to build my first decent board, probably spent 3X more than necessary becasue I bought stuff that failed...

I know I am fighting an unwinnable battle though, people will always buy the cheaper option in hope they save some money, it's only hindsight after pre-mature failure that teaches people they made a mistake.

Most people who buy enertion are not at their first rodeo. They have the learned from mistakes.

so you recommend the OP buy from enertion, thanks :smile:

the fact of the matter is we don't know what the rider of this board weights, OP says small hills, what does that actually mean? +20Mph is fairly fast... It means the board needs to go like 40km/h... 

All on a single motor?

there is a chance the hobby stuff won't last long... At least go dual drive SK3 6354's

I would actually bet that over half the people on here aren't teenagers, want to go over 35kph, and are at least 75kg! 

This whole argument has turned into jason giving a reason to justify his motors and people coming up with obscure users who wouldn't benefit from his reasons.. just don't argue and buy hobbyking if that's how you feel!

Trying to tell Jason his motors are over priced and things like waterproofing, flexible wire, and aesthetics aren't necessary isn't going to pan over well.. 

At that point you might aswell just go ahead and get rid of the keyway while your at it, right?

And in the end we all ride different so our set ups reflect that....I slap on 1/2 inch angle risers to the 50 degree Calibers....It can get twitchy at high speed but a carving monster at just below that...

Totally get it...3 now 4 motors...I'll be on my third brand of motor that I have no clue what the name is...I know only it matches my simple specs....prob gonna blow 💥 this one up too (Ahh the smell 👃🏻 of burt wiring in the morning)

Four deck styles....

...an ESC.... 🔥

Doing the same development process myself .... Build...Rebuild...old deck...new deck...trigger remote....thumb remote...blah blah blah...(dang I'm getting pretty good at soldering) 

You push the board till something breaks then figure out why it happened...Is it mechanical failure, forget to put thread locker on something or were you riding like a maniac?...Where's the line?

Living and breathing this stuff is far different than doing the 9 to 5, then 🏃🏻 running home to geek 🤓 out on your one precious e-board project that you want to last 4EVER.

I think ANY motor, ESC and hardware CAN last a long time..Maybe even 4EVER...if you make sure that there is zero movement in the motor to bracket and bracket to truck (thread locker is key)...the belt tension is perfect as to not put unnessary pressure on the motor bearings....OH and of course....You need to ride like a WUSS.

I think all the people doubts about how you say your product is better .... Is justified and reasonable ....to think as they do make sense...

That being said....IF you have had the same experience as some of the others have had with the products they are using...There would be no need to switch from that NTM Brushless Motor..or EMP or whatever...You'd just be in the business of brackets and spacely sprockets.....oh and Space Cell Battery (Shameless Plug 😉)

Only way to find out if @onloop's 💩 Is any good ... Is to try yourself and see what all the hub bub is about... 

Fuck sake ... I'm with the "haven't tried an RSpec, but my 💩 Is just as good" group... Till I try it with "my set up".... I won't be a beliver .... Can't blame Jason for thinking his baby is the prettiest in the pageant 👸🏻 .... I'll give him the benefit of the doubt....Will it make me buy his motor...Nope........for now.

My question here to those doubting the claim that enertion motors are much better motors.

Have you tried the r-spec motor, and compared it to the performance of the other motors?

If yes, and you feel that the motors are still way overpriced, you have the right to form your own opinion and feel that way.

If no, then without being rude, stfu and buy one to try. Honestly, I hate nothing more than someone talking shit about something they have never used.

To say a motor like the sk3 and the r-spec are capable of the same performance is ignoring whats different. The sk3 may work close to the same as an r-spec in certain situations. But there is a difference. You can test them just as onloop did, just run an r-spec and a sk3 up steep hills with weights until they break, and I think we all know which one will break first.

If you are light and riding flat ground and your not going to push the boards limits, a sk3 is probably fine. But to say the only difference beside the wires is marketing is bs.

@evoheyax - As I've said.... Any and all of those features on your GODSEND Enertion Motor are STANDARD Features made from the same factory as any other motor. Don't let the fancy words fool you.

If naming the standard features is what turns you on.... lmfao. Who the hell in their right mind will handwind an order of 200+ motors. NOBODY. You'd be retarded. Even China knows not to use their bearings and to import Japanese bearings for motors. Obviously, you wouldn't machine with low tolerance or soft materials. Your motor will fall apart on it's first spin. Everything that is listed is a STANDARD feature..

If your motor blew, it's because you don't know how to use it properly. Your gearing was inadequate. Your setup was inadequate.

But you'll believe what you believe..so be it. But hey, if that's what you believe.. Good :smile: 

But don't preach they are GODSEND and your info is bogus.

Perception of value is always going to be relative to an individual, so I'll not try to convince anyone that my perception of value is right and theirs is wrong. However, I do have observations to share:
1.) Budget is boss. The $250 dual motors might be more cost effective LONGTERM, but it's probably moot if your all in build budget is $500.
2.) I've yet to read a post claiming Enertion's motors aren't powerful enough (I have the dual setup and its way more power than I need). 
3.) I've yet to read a post about Onloop backing away from a warranty claim or service issues. 
4.) Onloop's design philosophy isn't guesswork. The approach of over engineering and building a product to run for long periods at 60-70% of max tolerances is actually the tried and true formula used by ALL mass produced vehicles. Everything from automobiles to airplanes...How else do you think manufactures ensure reliability?

enertion stuff is great stuff.  that's not being questioned.  but when they make claims that they are better than other great stuff out there they need to back up those claims.  
the warranty is a great feature that other motors don't have maybe.
and the keyway
and the flexible wires

other claims to it being better are only hype unless they can be explained.
All other claims made about these motors are so vague as to be meaningless.
Saying something like "better steel" in the stator is empty.  Even bashing hand wound motors vs machine wound ones isn't necessarily fair. and on and on.  There are numbers that explain a motor's performance not just saying "premium" and better than other motors.  Open a motor and you'll see they visually are almost all are identical to the enertion.

we're not attacking anyone or their product just putting them in the context of the market realistically.

I agree overall the topic in general was about what is the best motor but tbh you all seem to forgot that everyone is going to have their own opinion. Now if you want to compare specs thats one thing but the only real way to know how well a motor works or how efficient it is the only real way to find out is to test the hell out of that motor. But at the end of the day no one is going to have the exact same preference because there are just too many factors to consider. Weight, weather conditions, inclines along the way, different batteries, and most important how hard you pull that throttle. Now just throwing in my two cents id say that enertion will most likely have the best motors at the ed of the day. However that being said I dont know if I could necessarily say cost effective. You can go out and buy an sk3 for a cheaper price and have it last as long as an enertion motor if you specifically design it to your setup. However in my opinion I would say that the tacon is the most cost effective motor(yes i have one now). It can take a nice beating and I have heard literally no bad news about this motor ever. I've also never tried an enertion motor but in the video @onloop showed earlier the tacon was probably the closest to being just as good as the r-spec. But there are hundreds of motors out there that can probably beat the r-spec in some way or another but it really just depends on the person using it.

I wouldnt disagree with you when the tacon 245kv motors were $55. If I knew about those 160's I would have made a dual rear setup no question. 

Thats $300 for the motors and VESc's. $150 for battery/charger $120 for mounts and $100 for pulleys , extra belts and spacers/wires 
TOTAL: ~$700 for a economy dual rear 63mm set up
Thats a INFINITY better deal than enertion if people have excellent reliability with Tacons (which the apparently do). 

I will recommend a SK3 motor for most other purposes on 10S+. quite cheap and cost effective FOR MOST people. Enertions motors have a fixed market where they are needed. I and many other will stay a little more diy by modifying many more SK3s to come.

A high quality motor isn't open to interpretation or personal tastes

 A higher quality motor will have more copper:
To get that you need simply a good job of winding it and that could be done by a machine but much more likely will come from a person. People who buy 300$ scorpion motors and then rewind them do it for a reason.  It will likely also be single strand because a single strand wrapping will have less space wasted on the insulating enamel.  more copper means more magnetic force or inductance as amps go through them. 
  Heat produced in the windings are known as "copper loses".

thinner laminations on the stator:
This is an obvious advantage. A typical hobbyking, tacon, and probably enertion motor will have .35mm stator laminations: the stator is made of thin sheets of steel glued together.  The thinner the lamination equates to less heat due to eddy currents.  This lose of energy in the stator which goes to heat and a slight buzz sound is known as "iron losses" 

The airgap:
Most hobby motors are machined to have a .5mm between the stator and rotor's magnets.  Maybe even .6mm.   For a skateboard motor and almost all motors a smaller airgap is better as it equates to more torque. 

The magnets:
Stronger is better.  Bigger is better. Curved is better. High heat is even better.  N42 is probably standard in the hobby world.  Letters after the number is code for higher heat potential.  Standard N42, or even N52 all have the same max operation temp and Currie number (which is a bit higher than the max op temp and where the magnet strength is irreversibly lost) I think it's 80 degrees c.   I forget now but some will get up to at least 200 degrees c.  Be like 45sh or something.   N52 is the strongest but as the magnetic strength goes up heat ability goes down and you won't find any N52 with a letter after them denoting higher temp.  

all these ingredients and the variations in their quality can give you either a 63mm motor that has no problem overcoming a hill at 20 amps or a motor that struggles and takes 25 to get the torque to do it and cooks itself...passes the magnet's max opportunity temp and they lose their strength...so you add more amps to compensate... And now you're at the magnet's Currie number and they've permenantly lost their strength...and now you've probably melted a winding.  And here's your false economy. 




Bearings:
Not important really as they're relatively cheap and don't cause almost any resistance.  Being cheaper or more expensive mostly equates to their lifespan.  Size more than anything else determines the load they can take.  3 bearings in the motor being better than 2 makes sense. 

There's are other parts less likely to cause a problem as it's pretty easy to get right and cheap parts of the motor.   Could really put bearing in here....Balancing...magnet spacing...how thick the flux ring is...glue holding magnets in place...

***glue holding the windings is a good idea with the vibrations these motors take as the thin windings will rub off their insulation against each other and short.  I bet while onloop doesn't know what the fuck caused his test motors to crap out...maybe it was here.l

Raise your hand if anyone in this thread owns or has ever seen an R-SPEC motor? Anyone?

In fact, raise your hand if you have ever done any side-by-side motor testing? real world testing? Anyone?

Raise your hand if you have got samples from all the of the major china factories & tested them for the last two years?? Come on? Anyone?


----------


**Here is the deal.**

**ALIEN**, they originally bought motors from saite, and also some from EMP. But EMP don't exist anymore (they went out of business) they have broken apart & the engineers have all gone and started there own small-scale motor assembly operations. Where they hand wind stuff, guess KV and use cheapest components because they are competing directly with each other on price now.

**DIY Electric Skateboards**, was buying from saite, then switched to EMP, now I assume is dealing with these small players who used to work for EMP. Or maybe went back to saite, he keeps changing his motor factory & motor design... I assume because they are not living up to his expectations. That's why his warranty doesn't cover you once the motor has been used on your esk8! this is what its says on his website ***"Any claims arising from the operating, failure or malfunctioning of our product will be denied."***


[quote="torqueboards, post:85, topic:1906"]
As I've said.... Any and all of those features on your GODSEND Enertion Motor are STANDARD Features made from the same factory as any other motor. Don't let the fancy words fool you.
[/quote]

If these *things* i talk about are so common/standard why are they missing from your NEW motors?

Also, why don't you advertise your motors are water resistant? it's a standard feature right?

have your motors had Computerized dynamic balancing checks? why no visible counter balancing weights? That's standard stuff right?

I would be asking your motor factory about this stuff ASAP

**ITS ALL COST CUTTING TECHNIQUES**

Here is a current example of cost cutting by DIY Electric Skateboards.

There is no magnet retainer ring, Magnets held with glue only. So the question is will this glue deteriorate with constant temperature fluctuations? What glue did they use?

That's one visible example of **standard** parts completely missing, So what other cost-cutting techniques have been implemented here with this motor to get the price lower?

**As long as RESELLERS are out there trying to buy the cheapest motors they can find, the quality will always remain 2nd rate.**

There's extra balancing blue goo in there too.


Water resistant isn't a biggie. The magnet wire is already insulated all that further needs to be done is seal the solder connection to the motor leads.  Actually the tacon with its extended magnet wire that turns into the leads is waterproof.  Not nice and flexy but waterproof

Any testing done by onloop is suspect especially since as he says  he has no fucking idea why they break on him.  Are they burning out or shorting? It's pretty much one or the other.  Read what I wrote and you'll understand the basics of how they burn out.  Shorting...make sure the motor leads aren't losing their insulation and there's no lose windings inside

However he is the only retailer for electric skateboards that I have seen do this everyone else just gives us specs. There is nothing wrong with this either but at the end of the day If the customer can afford it and the store owner is completely transparent about his product then anyone with common sense would go with that retailer. Props to @onloop by the way for just creating this forum which shows his dedication to the product. As soon as I'm done with my current build you can expect a purchase for one of your motors

Enertions motors are for the toughest and most serious workloads. that will last the longest.

But if you're a teenager or other light to medium build person riding on mostly flat to 10% hills than a big SK3 motor is fine.


If I was a teenager again, i would have to sell a shit ton of Mary Jane to afford the prices for Enertion

If onloop wants to reveal what's in his motors that's up to him. Transparency is not happening. That's fine. But to make claims that your motors are better...that asks the question why. 
The stator lamination size ...the magnet numbers...the airgap.  
We will see transparency or not.  I fear he's stuck in a hole at this point and claiming he doesn't know the science behind how these things work but his own informal tests have somehow proven his unknown motors somehow trump the others

**this topic is actually about what is most cost effective....**

my argument is simple.... & I will not change my opinion because it is an opinion that is derived from personal experience... from real world testing & from selling thousands of products to real people using them in the real world for the last three years... & i can assure you people tell me when my products are rubbish...and it's my job to make them better.

before I had these current R-SPEC motors I sold many other motors sourced from many other motor factories and my failure rates were much higher! so I was forced to find better motors...& i did, they cost more but they are better because they fail less..... its really that simple... 

some reviews from my customers, real world feedback about the product [MORE REVIEWS][1]

Therefore,

my opinion is the most cost effective esk8 build is the one the never fails & the one that has a warranty that covers the product when being used on an esk8....

this is my opinion, if you all disagree that is also fine.

Lol... For your info... There is a retainer ring on that motor. You just can't see it in that image. The backside the retainer covers the entire magnets and on the front side it covers only part of the magnets.

My motors live up to my expectations and then some.. I use these motors on rough roads on a daily basis where 30-40% of my routes are uphill climbing 20-30% inclines.

I ride over potholes and cracks for days to make sure they are up to the test for anyone.

I may not mention I cover motors on my website. But I care for each of my customers and know it is expensive and I do my best to help out as much as I can. If the issue is 100% legitimate. I replace the motors. Sure, I'll take a full loss because in the end. The joy everyone get's from riding is the important part. Sharing the fun and making it easier for everybody.

So your talking about a few bucks in STANDARD motor features.. Can hike up the motor almost 1/3rd the cost?

I have no issues with your motors. I'm sure, they are STANDARD motors.

My issues are just how you chalk it up like your using GODSEND technology that nobody has access too and that these features are NOT all STANDARD.

Your using some N5000 magnets and GLUE5000 on your motors.

Don't fool anyone because you just dumb down the community.

You can't compare a 50mm motor to a 63mm motor. It's obvious a 63mm motor is more durable by far.

Anyone can burn out a motor.. I can put your motor on a setup with a belt so tight and 200 lbs above the board and burn out your motor. It's no rocket science. Even your so called High Quality Motors can burn up... Just run them above the temperatures to mess them up.

Teach people how to use the equipment and parts to further extend the life of their parts.

Don't get RC motors because their unreliable! Etc. Fake.. Don't believe it.

So yes, when someone doesn't have enough money.. I tell them to get their parts elsewhere. I tell them it will work and it will do fine. I tell them exactly where to get it. It's not the best option but hey.. if you want cheaper.. it is available. Sure, they lack some features but you'll be able to enjoy riding an electric skateboard.

So no, your motors aren't the most cost effective esk8 build... Fancy...Flashy.. Hype Written.. sure...

Just because a RESELLER says they are HIGH QUALITY... Don't be naive. Do your homework...

This is what I'm talking about....

8mm High Tensile Grade A - SUS420J2 HRC55 - Precision Milled Shaft Stainless Steel Axle
**You mean 8mm Stainless Steel Motor Shaft**

Precision Bearing Assembly 688Z with dynamic load rating of 1606N You mean 688Z Bearing.
**Bearings are high precision bearings, we'll duh. Yes.. 688Z is a standard bearing. Yes, your bearing is $1.00 retail...must be cheaper than $1 then, right?**

20cm flexible high stand count pure copper & silicon 12awg wires.
**You mean 12awg wires - which are by default high strand silicone wire if they are meant for RC cars? But you said RC cars aren't good for electric vehicles**

So I'm going to put it in a fancy box for you and make it sparkle and dazzle and confuse you with awesome words.. I'll hike my price up because I'm now high quality.

Go to show for it...You even got your 1st batch of VESC's from Flier...Here you are preaching about high quality... With all the manufacturers available for PCB Production and Assembly.. You choose Flier out of all people.

Im curious which motor is better an sk3 260kv or a tacon 245kv lets assume on a 6s or 10s setup with hilly terrain.

Both will work. 6s/10s depends. 

Doesn't matter too much.

Turnigy 6374 motor. 2 Years of riding in the summer. Still going perfectly. The "rigid" wires haven't broken. The magnets haven't fallen off (I ride quite rough tarmac sometimes). Bearings are fine. 

They are just motors. ;-)

Yep...ur a perfect example of wise use of your board...most likey rock solid bracket and you prob know the limits of your board and stay within that limit...

But what if you're a No Limit Soldier??? :smirk:

I don't know if this equates to a real world difference, but my Tacon 245kv feels like it provides more magnetic resistance when turning it by hand, compared to the SK3 245kv. Maybe stronger magnets in the Tacon? I don't have enough miles on both to know for sure which one is "better" (they both feel pretty strong to me), but throughout my reading on the forums, it seems like the Tacon has kind of a reputation for being a pretty torquey motor.

I've tried "notchy" and less "notchy" motors... Maybe it's me...lol I can't feel the diffrence when up and running under my feet .... but I'm sure there is if you get them analyzed

For budget stuff....
Tacon 245kv Motor $63.74 Free shipping! 
http://www.hobbypartz.com/96m608-bigfoot160-5335-245kv.html
Pretty sick pricing!! 
If you haven't checked out Dexter's stuff...
product/torqueboards-single-motor-mechanical-kit/
$199 Trucks, mounts, wheels, drive....Everything you need mechanically. 
VESC...
product/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/
$99 
UNDER A HUNDRED BONES!!! 
SO you are running right around $364 without battery and remote
Not too shabby. 
If the dude you are building for has a deck already up for the project and maybe even a set of trucks, then that makes it even cheaper!!
You could possible go cheaper if you built the mounts and drive system yourself. It's totally doable. But you gotta consider that your time is money as well.

BTW: Dexter tests his stuff in San Francisco, CA. Not for the faint of heart. Inclines are everywhere and steep as fuck!!

Hands down the best motors on the market for our use are the large sk3 series.  The bell housing is supported on both ends unlike any other motor commonly used. The factory that builds the sk3 is well known for the quality engineering and manufacturing. It is a solid product. I am currently in talks with them to produce a modified version with a slightly longer shaft with keyway. Don't get your hopes up yet, they want me to order at least 100 units. It will probably have to wait till I am finished retooling for the V5.0 VESC.

If you are on a budget and building 8s or less get a tacon 245kv, tons of power. 

Why are the tacons so cheap compared to other motors coming from maytech? This may be a huge surprise to some people but Maytech doesn't make motors, they market them. They are a distributor  of sorts. The actual retail value of these motors is around $55 to $70. If you go factory direct you can get these for much less and save your customers some money. 

The Tacon design is shared by many many motors on the market. It is the simplest motor you can manufacture and should be priced accordingly. If you guys got together and did a group buy you can get them wound to any kv you like and buy from Maytech. You need to order in much larger quantities to get them directly from the manufacture but maytech is happy to take short orders if you don't mind paying retail for custom motors. 

A final note, switching over to flexible wires is proving to be a bad move. It allows the wire to move and rub on the motor housing causing shorts in the windings. It has been killing VESC's. If you have one of these motors, see if you can slip some heatshrink over the uninsulated section inside the housing to prevent this from happening.. Having rigid wires allows the movement to be isolated better so it is a good thing to have.

Let us know what your testing results look like. I'm very interested in your observations both pros and cons!

I have to say I'm a little surprised anyone is interested whether motor x might have more power than motor y when, at least on the two 6374 / 6364 boards I've made, full throttle without being physically prepared,  results in you being thrown off the board,  and that's on 6s.

I'd be more concerned with longevity.

Its what happens at higher speeds that is important. Using a powerful motor will also allow a rider to use them gently rather than running a smaller motor hard under the same conditions.
