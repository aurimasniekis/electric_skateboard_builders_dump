Hi,

I recently found this battery on the internet and I found some very good reviews and you can find these for a very good price.
But I can't find the datasheet with discharge curves.
Some think they are like the Samsung 40T but Sofirn comfirmed it's not just a rebrand.

I really hoped lygte had tested this cell so we could see the discharge curve.

Maybe someone else knows more about these?

the maximum discharge is 12A, I don't know where your 40A comes from

Where did you get the 12A from?
They say 10C so that's 40A but of course that's a lot so I guess around 30A max like the samsung 40T.

I also asked Lygte to test this cell.

Itâ€™s on the page you linked to.  12A if you keep the battery under 45 degrees, and 6A max between 45 and 60 degrees centigrade.
