Better to leave this thread up for others to reference.
I found this pic on another thread under a different topic.

Ha. I remember the first time when I was trying out BLDC sensored. Every time I ran sensor detection, the VESC shuts off like there's a short. Realised after 2 weeks, I plugged the sensored cord into program/debug port :rofl: and since it was DIY VESC, the sensor port was hidden by the 10awg wires. Had a big facepalm afterwards.

Just installed the Hall Sensor onto the VESC, selected sensor and configured everything with my motor on the VESC Program. But I really didn't noticed anything different on my ride. Did I do something wrong ? ðŸ¤”

What were you expecting to notice? 
Before using sensors did you have to foot push to start?  If yes check now starting from a full stop. 
By the way.  After configuring sensors did you set sensor or hybrid?

```
hybrid is compatible with any voltage/setting compatible with full-sensored or non-sensored setup with hall-sensors.
And the snwer is yes, 9s is fine.
