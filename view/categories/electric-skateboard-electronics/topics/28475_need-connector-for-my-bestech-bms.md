Hallo

I have a Bestech D223v1 10S BMS, i bought from a user of this forum.
But i`m missing the two connectors for the ballancing ports.
I dont know what the connectors is called, and where to buy them (im from EU)

Any help :-)

No, it's a 10s bms 
Pins 1-8 on the left
Pins 9-10 on the right
The e/ switch is 2 white wires soldered to the pcb
```

You will have to contact Bestech and order the connectors or remove the sockets and solder your balance wires to the pcb. 
If this was a new bms, it should have come with connectors. Maybe the seller forgot to pack them.

Contact the person you bought it from first. 
He should have included the connectors

Those look like "JST-XH" connectors

The 8-pin version is sometimes referred to as "7S".  2-pin might be called "1S"

I thought the same, that these were JST-XH, the same as used on lipo batteries. But it`s not.... they don`t fit.

Oh, my BMS from another vendor is different.  Then in that case it is probably **JST-PH**
```

What's the pitch between pins?

2.5mm JST-XH
**2mm JST-PH** (most likely this one)
1.5mm JST-ZH
1mm JST-SH
```

2.5mm same as JST-XH But the plastic connector does not have the same form facter like my regular jst-xh connectors on my lipo batteries

So, here is what I would do.

Basically, pull the plastic off the pins and connect JST-XH.

Or, alternatively:

tear the plastic until JST-XH fits :)

Why bend it if the pitch is the same.

Looked it up, in that case they should be:

2.5mm **JST-EH**

Not really common. But something you can search for.

Anyone have a spare 8 position JST-EH?  They seem to be out of stock everywhere, and amazon/ebay prices are absurd.
