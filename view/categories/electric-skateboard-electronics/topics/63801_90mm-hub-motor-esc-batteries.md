Hi,
So im looking into building a new board, i have a board with a belt driven motor but i wanna change things up a bit. I found these motors and ESC on youtube, is this a good option? also what do you guys reccomend on batteries? LiPo, 18650? what kind? series parallel config? My budget for motor/ESC/Batteries is 300$, i already have a deck.

Hub motors:

ESC:

You should keep in mind that you can't change the PUs when they're done. There are replaceable PU versions already out there ;)

They also have the ones you found on ebay http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-hub-motor-9052mm-1000w75kv-power-truck-p-657.html, but the replaceable ones are better or do you feel fine with throwing away a perfectly fine motor only because the tires wear down?
