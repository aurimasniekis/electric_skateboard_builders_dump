Ok so I have a posted a couple times about this problem and really want to get to shredding. My board drops all Torque and brakes after about a mile to 2 miles. I can rip around @ 25-31mph and brake easily but then once I hit about a half mile it starts declining and then by a mile or 2 I can‚Äôt even get up to 20 mph. I previously ran 10s 5000mah lipos and series and would get 4+ miles @ 25 before losing power I figure the huge pack would give me more speed (which it has but only for a short time ) then a shit ton more distance.

TB 6374 190kv motor 
TB 12s4p
TB VESC 4.12 
16/36 with 12mm belt
Running 97mm wheels but also have 90 and 83mm 
Nano 2.4 ghz remote 

Is there anything wrong in my settings? 

All I want to do is coast around the flat streets around 25-30mph for 10+ miles which the motor, VESC and battery should all handle. I do know I‚Äôm pushing the erpm limit

I'm not an expert by any means, but I have had similar issues recently.  Started off with heat issues and moved on to battery issues.

I cut windows out of the clear shrink on the VESC around the Mosfets
I drilled holes in my enclosure (yes no longer waterproof)
I ordered a heatsink package off of ebay for about $2
--I'm not sure which of these helped but I definitely do not have heat issues anymore.

After this, I ordered a $10 HM-10 LP Bluetooth module.  In my mind, this is the easiest solution to debugging these issues and was well worth the $10.  It let me see that by VESC was cutting out because of extreme voltage sag which I could not see otherwise.  It also gives you live temperature readings.

I had 10S3P Li-ion 18650.  with 36/16 100mm wheels.  In the process of going 40/16.  

I **dont** think your Batt/Motor Amps are too your high with single and 12s4p

The motor heat is different than the VESC heat as well. I have never experience motor heat with my twin 6355 (or even when I run single).  I imagine you would experience MOSFET temp limit before MOTOR temp limit  -  All from my very limited experience

One of my VESC completely burned at about the same time yours was shutting down.  It was after doing 25-30mph for a few miles - Trying to resolve my own similar problems :slight_smile:

Bluetooth module was well worth the money for charting statistics and debugging.

I wouldn't go out and buy a new VESC - You just need some hard facts to 100% know exactly what is going on.  
You need to first figure out if it is VESC Temp, Motor Temp, Low Voltage that is kicking your board into lower power mode. 
"once I hit about a half mile it starts declining and then by a mile or 2 I can‚Äôt even get up to 20 mph"

Whether you do this through your laptop, bluetooth, or some other means - get some hard data.

No expert here either. But 12s and 190kv are over the erpm limit of the vesc. 10s and 190kv is the sweet spot. I run 12s with 170kv motors. Maybe this is part or all of the problem.

There are ways to limit the erpm in bldc tool under the motor tab. I am not the right person to help with that. 

Search limit erpm. But becareful regarding the limiter and negative torque.

Best of luck.

I can hold it but it would be pretty hot for 10 seconds. Not burning but definitely not comfortable. 

Can I limit the erpm or duty cycle? I just want to get some intense range. I did 12s because I‚Äôve seen so many builds with 190kv 12s but now I‚Äôm regretting it! I was being greedy

 You're probably overheating the VESC. What's the airflow in your enclosure?
Use the bluetooth module and analyze the data. Usually when the VESC overheats it's cutting the power. So you have worse performance later on.
If you can, go dual drive. I mean, it's easier on the motors, vesc's, and battery. And it pulls like mad. :)

No to much air flow in the enclosure but I cut holes in the bottom side for the charger port, on off and voltage meter so it should have air flow. @psychotiller do you think I should make holes in the front for more air flow?

Yeah, I literally cooked one of my VESC 4.12 in the enclosure without the airflow. I wasn't monitoring it at all. When it was hot outside after like 5-7 min of bombing the roads it always started to cut top power. Enclosure was hot, so was the motor-but I could hold it without problems. It worked for like a month. Then on a very hot day after an hour of riding my first VESC went drv8032 :slight_smile:

Then with the new VESC I've started to monitor my temps, made some holes to let the heat out, even thought about the fan option. Well, after going dual with focboxes, my temps are at low 30-35C max with air temp around 20C. 
With VESC they were around 60+ with airflow on a single drive which was safe and it didn't cut any power at all. So under 80C it's safe but not in the long run anyway...heat is a b***h :D

The fan option seems like a pretty good idea if it‚Äôs cheap. So the only way to check my temp is with a Bluetooth modular? Otherwise a laptop would be off because it would be delayed due to me taking my enclosure off

Yeah but then you must get a step down converter because majority of fans operate at 12V. So that's more things to stuff into the enclosure.

BT module with a phone app or even apple watch app is very handy and you can easily monitor the ride and act accordingly.

Look on ebay for an EZ run fan. They are easy to install in enclosures. Then you'll just need a servo splitter to get power to the fan. Plug and play. I think honestly 12s/190 kv is the culprit. I have lots of builds with little to no ventilation and no overheating issues  but I stayed within the vesc's limits.

Nope, that's not what I said. You can make holes and get a fan, or both. But it won't change the fact that you are running 190kv @12s. You're going to end up over the erpm limit and you are going to burn out your drv's eventually.

I'm running 190kv at 12s with limit set at 80k erpm, haven't had any issues yet but I'm rarely hitting top speed, if ever. 

also have giant holes in my enclosure for airflow and noticed vesc temps actually DROP at speed. 

get some venting going, pretty sure vesc throttles current when temps increase. also may consider cutting out vesc shrink wrap where the mosfets are. 

also how and where u have your vesc positioned in your enclosure may have an impact.

Are you running a dual motor setup. I have my 12s4p battery in the front and then I could fit another 2-3 vesc‚Äôs Where my one vesc is. I have everything velcored down to my board so there isn‚Äôt much stress on the enclosure. I did use weather proof strips so I know there isn‚Äôt much ventilation besides the wholes I cut for my battery charging port, on/off and voltage meter. 

So you think I should raise the erpm limit and cut some holes?

[/quote]

If you stop after a mile and wait 15 whole minutes, then go again -- where the 15min delay is the only thing different -- does it still cut out?  If it resets your "mile or 2", then it might be heat problems because the 15 minutes could allow something to cool off.  But voltage sag could have similar symptoms.  
Try A) riding 2 miles B) riding 1 mile, 15 minute wait, riding 1 mile and C) riding 1 mile, charge battery while waiting 15 min, then ride one mile
Carefully scrutinise the differences

The little heatsinks in this  pack worked for me.  They are the exact size of the mosfets.  (Blows my mind that someone can even sell and ship from China to US for $2 :slight_smile: )  

While you are waiting to receive these, definitely get the windows cut where the MOSFETS are - I did both top and bottom and tried to keep the window exact and not to expose the legs/terminals

I also picked this little fan up for $2.99.  I'm going to see if I all heat issues are resolved for myself before installing it.

Your issue is a matter of leverage. 16/36 is fine for 83/90mm wheels. Switch to a 40T and watch your problems disappear.

The 36T with big wheels causes higher amp draw...which means more heat.

heat sinks can be very helpful.
if your gearing is too tall and your climbing hills, then that's a problem.
If your just going fast on flat ground, you should not be overheating, unless your going against a strong wind.
if your doing a lot of stop and go and not pushing the board to get going then that could be a problem.

That's fine and all


But what wheel size and gearing? And how heavy are you? What works for one person won't always work for the next... 

My buddy runs 12s dual 6374 190kv with 60kerpm limit too..but it would be really vague if I left the info there.
 As he doesn't get over heating issues... But he's using 16/40 and 100mm wheels...and weighs about 180lbs.

As @Namasaki said, it all depends on factors. But factors you can control, are wheel size and gearing, as you cannot easily change your weight or the rest of the build without a "lot" of money. Pulleys, and wheels are a lot cheaper then different kv motors or batteries.

Yeah, I do realize that, I was just trying to throw in some more data into the mix.  Probably should have included some more information.

I weigh about 145, and I am using 83mm wheels like some of you were suggesting for him to use.  Which I also agree would probably help his situation, as there is a higher torque amount transferred due to the smaller radius of the wheels.  And it does depend on factors.   I am also running 16/36 gearing on 12mm belt.  I have "knock you off the board" torque with that, and can climb hills no problem.  I haven't seen my temps go any higher than a peak of about 47-50 degrees in the Ackmaniac app.

Apologies for being a bit vague, that was less helpful than I originally intended lol

What @Deckoz said is completely right.

I had the same issue a few days ago.
Tried to punch holes in my enclosures - Didn't work, Tried to Switch between batteries - Didn't work, Switched motors - Didn't work, Heat sink on all 6 MOSFETs - Didn't work.
The ONLY thing that worked is changing my gear ratio.
I changed my wheel pulley from 36t to 44t getting the ratio of 15t/44t.

Running 10s with 245kv motor on 97mm wheels.

I may sound like a fool but the real end solution to overheating the electronics and the motor is basically going dual drive.

You don't have to sacrifice the top speed gearing for it, you get amazing acceleration, fantastic brakes, a lot less heat and you really run your system the way it should be - cool and with less strain on the belts, pulleys and motor shafts; all that with lower, more conservative parameters in the BLDC/ VESC tools. 

I was on a single setup for like two months...only regret I got is that I didn't go dual earlier. :smiley:

Sure that's an answer... But i m pretty sure he already stated he didn't want to spend a lot more money to fix it.

A pulley and belt is about $25 bucks.

Another vesc, motor, motor mount, motor pulley, wheel pulley, belt, canbus wire, and sensor wire(if he has sensors) could be a varying cost of 250-500 depending on the components he chooses.

So is your solution really a solution? Sure for those that are willing to spend the money for the upgrade. But not for this guy.

Also sacrificing top speed?  16/36 on 83mm on 12s will net you about 33mph with a light rider. Move up to bigger wheels and your at 36-37mph. Increase your reduction with a 40T on the bigger wheels and you end up at basically the same top speed as the16/36T 83mm combo... So sacrifice? Not really.

The thing is...the money he'll throw in to find a solution for a single drive woes could be easily invested into dual drive. 
VESC is not designed to last, we all know that, especially in single drive setups. It's pushed to it's max and usually doesn't end well. 
12S and 190kV is drv8032 in just a matter of time. And we all want to enjoy the hobby as much as possible.

Going DIY is the most expensive path out of them all and in the end the most satisfying one. I could buy the evolve GT or raptor 2 and be done with it. It would cost me way less than going into single drive territories and now dual drive. God knows what else will itch me on the way :slight_smile:

It's just my perspective and the way I would do. You would buy bigger wheels, pulleys, belts and probably a new VESC and that's another 250-300$.

I would buy 2x focboxes, additional 190kV motor, belt and a pulley and that's like 400-450$. And much better ride experience. My 2 cents.

Nice, glad stepping down in wheel size helped. 

Since your going dual 6374,  and you already have some nice big plush 97s, when you do end up with duals, swap out to a 16/40 and you should get all the road plush you want and the speed without any of the heat :)
