Does anyone know if there's any restrictions right now on the manufacturer that makes and ships the space cell?

I ordered one a week and a half ago, and haven't received anything to indicate that it has even been shipped. I know there have been issues in the past with the shipping, so I'm wondering if anyone knows whats up. I've been trying to get a hold of Jason, but will no avail.

Hi. Thank you for your valued order.

A few reasons for delays. 

1. The china new year holiday. It is an annual holiday which last for about 3 weeks. So basically nothing happens for the month of February. 

2. Considering we had so many (6of30) issues with a batch of batteries that shipped end of January to raptor customers we are now in the process of changing all the switches on each instock battery to somthing more reliable.

So all space cell batteries will ship later this week.

All Space Cell orders have either shipped, or are being packed as we speak. 

For everyone in the states, @longhairedboy is helping to distribute them as Aviation regulations have become quite the pain.

Does this mean tracking numbers should have been sent out by now? Just wondering as my order is still showing as "Partially shipped". Should also mention I'm a NZ customer.

Shipping to NZ is very problematic at the moment. Your battery is ready and sitting in dispatch. Every day for last week we have talked with logistics company about sending.... They say there is a risk of it getting sent back. Ill check again today.

I can confirm that my Space Cell just showed up today, sans tracking number. :)  

Here's FedEx's shipping map to give you an estimate of when it might arrive if you live in the United States and your Space Cell was in the latest batch to be sent out.

Received mine today. btw, I would it would be nice to have a little extra space between the fuse box and battery. The box it is a bit bulky and in my situation, I needed to extend the wire to move the box to the side of the battery to fit it inside of my board. Not a big deal, but still it would be nice to have a bit more room for it as its not flat or small.

Hey mate, sorry for lack of communications. It seems shipping batteries to NZ is basically impossible.

I keep being told to wait and things might change, aviation regulations seem to change every 4-6 week since mid of last year. But i dont want to drag you on either.

Maybe a refund for now? maybe there is an option of sensing it as seperate cells?

It really sucks at them moment i basically cant send battereies anywhere in the entire world.

Can't even send them to australia either... so i cant even test my own prototypes.

Thanks for the update Jason. Man that's really frustrating though. Would it be feasible to maybe pull the battery apart and send smaller groups of cells/bms/switch etc separately then provide me with instructions on how to put it back together at my end? How complicated would this be? I'm happy to do a bit of soldering etc as long as long as it's not too complicated/the risk of destroying everything isn't too major :p I'm open to other options as well. Is it possible to send the battery by ship instead of by plane for example, don't mind paying a bit extra for shipping either. I'd prefer to keep refund as a last resort though as I'm going to need a battery either way.

We are investingating making kit forms, or even small modules under 100WH that join together, my business depends on the ability to ship battereis worldwide, so i am trying everything i can think of at the moment.

actually the battereis are faily simply to make with the correct tools.

Shipping via sea is one option. but not normally feasible for one signle item. 10 or 20 of them would make sense.

I am hoping to establish warehouses across the globe to help me mangage the logistics... its very complicated.

worse case scenario is i only end up selling in the USA.... :(  it explains why boosted boards only sell in US.

Ok thanks for the info. I've had most of the other parts for my board sitting in my room waiting to be assembled for the past couple of weeks so I'm really hoping to get this resolved sooner rather than later, so pulling the battery apart and send it for me to reassemble seems like it'd be the best option at this stage if that seems like a reasonable option to you?

Boosted are going to ship internationally by the end of this year. They said so on Twitter. I don't think they'll be a big hit in Australia though. They'll be like $2000 AUD. I think the Raptor will be a big hit in Aus if you could get the price down a bit so younger people (Teens young adults etc) Could afford it.

So its official I can't send batteries to Australia or New Zealand! fucking ridiculous... I cant even get my own batteries for testing etc..

What I can do is send you the battery as a bunch of parts! I can also get the cells grouped into bunches of 10, then you just need to connect them in parallel. Then connect the bms sense wires....

let me know what you want to do..

Wow, it's insane that we have problems like this with a technology that's been around for over 20 years... Again, I appreciate all the effort you've made trying to get this sorted though. Sounds like sending the battery in parts is going to be the best option, what sort of time frame will I be looking at to receive everything?

Ok well if that's the only option then that works for me. If you're happy to send them as completely separate packages that'd be much appreciated (will  hopefully save me about $130 in customs fees), but other than that, when are they likely going to be ready to be shipped? :)

## \#54 Posted by: michaelcpg Posted at: 2016-03-15T05:06:31.389Z Reads: 42

```
For most items that're imported, if the total GST value (15%) of a package's value is $60 or greater, then GST is payable plus a $50 "import entry transaction fee", whatever the hell that really means. Unfortunately I wasn't aware of the extra $50 fee per package when I made my last couple of orders otherwise I would've just ordered everything all at once :p
