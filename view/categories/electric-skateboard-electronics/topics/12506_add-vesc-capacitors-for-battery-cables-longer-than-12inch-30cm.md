Hi, i want to make a battery like Boosted board. Battery in front and Vesc in back. I read once somewhere that it is important to add 2 capacitors in parralel into the vesc to make this cable distance.

Is this one okay? im not sure about it:

So the caps on the vesc aren't enough? I thought that's what they were for.   What's the max length before I need to add caps? 

8s2p
20c lipo
10ga wire
2 vesc setup
```

@SageTX NEVER add any longer than 12 inches....12 inches is ok just dont add any more. So say if your vesc wires are 2 inches and battery wires are 2 inches, make sure all the wires dont add to over about 16 inches

Yeah should be fine as long as you get the right ones. Do you need to go longer than 16 inches though?

Not Finished yet. I will make a new build thread later. Ill tag you :)
I resolder my Space cell 4 and us it with this enclouse.

It will need 1 till max 2 weeks before i finish this build. Some parts need much time for shipping.

Is that really needed or just over kill?

Its really needed because of induction. And more different capacitors are never wrong. They are there for protecting your hardware and kill unwanted noise.

Thanks for posting this. I'm well over 20 inches on my farthest battery. Really green here with all this. Was hoping to get some advise on what type/size and number of capacitors to use. I have five 8S 5Ah lipos wired in parallel to two Max6 esc's. 

Still have some excess wire I need to remove since adding more batteries.

So I should defiantly add capacitors to this build then?
One one my VESC's came with just one capacitor as well. Is that something I should change?

[quote="benjammin, post:20, topic:12506"]
two Max6 esc's.

AFAIK this is only for the VESCs

@DilatedPupils

I know @chrisko used them on his Roxxy build, but yeah, most of what I'm coming up with here are with VESCs.

Just wanna make sure I don't fry my esc's. My wires are a lot longer than most of builds I'm seeing on here.

I'm using two Maytech VESC's and I am looking to go for two cases too, distance will be about 75 cm. Now each of the two Maytech VESC's already has 3 capacitors each 63V; 680ÂµF. Do you think I will need to install more?
