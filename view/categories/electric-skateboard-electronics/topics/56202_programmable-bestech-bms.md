What about a BMS that is software configurable?

I've been trying to find somewhere to buy that exact BMS, saw it used on some eBike forums.

New BMS just came out to replace this. It's definetly meant for higher powered applications though.

139$
[/quote]

is it worth this?  I really like idea of getting data from BMS and I thought I might be able to config it to bypass discharge.

I am wondering if it would be useful to change the overcharge set point to say 4.15 volts so that balancing would start before full charge of 4.2 volts per cell. Am I right that all other BMS don't float until they reach 4.2v per cell? I want set my charger to 4.15 to save some space for regenerative braking but still have parallel group balancing.
