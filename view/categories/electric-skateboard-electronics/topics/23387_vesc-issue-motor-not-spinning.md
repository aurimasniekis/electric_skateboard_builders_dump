Hey guys,
ive got some kind of problem with my vesc. Ive been using it for about 3 months and yesterday my board suddenly wont start up anymore. So ive checked for errors and the motor works with another vesc. So ive checked bldc tool for errors but there are none. 
The motor detection is also working fine and the motor spins, but when I try to start the motor via remote or bldc tool the motor is just kinda vibrating for a fraction of a second instead of starting. I can also see on realtime data that the vesc tries to apply amps to the motor for a short time. When turning manually duty cycles are also still tracked.
So basically everything works besides actually using the VESC :unamused:
In hope this made my problem understandable. Thanks for your help
