Hello all, I'm searching all over the internet to see if I can modify a standard XT60 parallel charging board to connect multiple high discharge "racing drone" (4S 100C) Lipo batteries to run my DIY board.  

To clarify, the parallel boards are designed to charge multiple Lipo batteries.  But I'm looking to modify the internal connections so that it will connect the Lipo batteries in either parallel or in series to supply power rather than charge.  

Is it even possible?  Thanks in advance for your help :)

I wouldn't. The traces are meant to handle relatively low amp draws and may not be thick enough for say 80~100a.
