Hi Community!

Can't find any info on how to control a horn from any of the free channels on the GT2B (although I see people mentioning they have added remote controlled horns to their boards). I'm in need of a total noob walk-through if anyone want to share. Parts needed, wiring/diagram and what-not..

I saw a great diagram from @mmaner for controlling lights on/off, but a guess a horn would need a temporary or timed switch maybe, unless you want to run with a constant hooooooonk.

All your thoughts, diagrams, theres-already-a-topic-explaining-this-links are much appreciated.

As mentioned I have the GT2B remote with receiver which will be hooked up to a VESC-X.

Unfortunately, most horns that would be loud enough to be heard will all be 12v and quite large.

Actually traffic regulations here requires the board to have a bell/horn. If that wasn't the case, old school is the way to go always :smile:
I like the simplicity of the finger bell though. Simpler is better!

Get one of these receiver controlled switches, then the button on the grip of the GT2B can switch something on and off. 

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-receiver-controlled-switch-1.html

Now to figure out what to do about the horn. Easiest may be a 5v buzzer with voltage tapped off the receiver. The sound will be annoying as fuck and maybe not very loud. 

If you want to use a real motorcycle type horn at 12v you will need a DC/DC step down converter to get a 12v line from your battery.  Something like this.

12v motor cycle horn.

necropost! I had most of the parts lying around, was gonna do lights.

[dropbox video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iuyfz69bagits3z/Rc%20horn%20test.mp4?dl=0)

The horn is 12v 1.5A, the green thing is a dual bec, has a 5v and 12v output.

I also bought a 36v horn, and I have some of those cheap buck converters. I figured a smaller voltage drop would be less stress on the converter. Will have to see.

The Turnigy RC switch doesn't seem to have latching behavior, so not good for lights using the steering thing, but good for the horn.

For those not familiar, on the mini remote the trigger goes to CH2 on the receiver, the wheel on the side goes to CH1. In the video, the RC switch thing hooks up to CH1, and switches the 12v line. Need 5v for the receiver (usually from vesc), and 12v 1.5a for the horn.

Gotta mount it up now.

I made this wireless air horn that I keep on the outside pocket of knapsack. 
I also use a separate remote to toggle it because at the time i was using a remote with only 1 channel. I just got the 'winning' remote so need to try that second channel now.
The horn is a little too big to mount on the bottom of my board. But its louder than most cars :wink:

Ive decided to go with a bicycle hand bell. A horn from a vehicle is just too loud and harsh and not at all polite. 99% of the time its pedestrians on cycle-ways and pavements i need to warn. 

If i were using it solely on the road though, then id consider a regular horn.

i'm watching this thread with interest. I would like some kind of "HEY I'M COMING UP ON YA" sound too, but after a lot of jokes about train and truck horns we're looking for something more car like. But not exactly like a car, there's rules about horns you have to recognize what they are. I don't want to be mistaken for a car. or a train. but something in that vein of sound.

I cant think of any reason why you couldn't use a turnigy switch connected to an available channel in conjunction with a 12v step down convertor and a really small car horn.  Seems pretty simple, but yeah, being mistaken for a car could be dangerous.

I found one.  Pop one of these on there with an air compressor and it definitely won't be too big or heavy, and won't make pedestrians mad or cause your way of life to be outlawed.  Definitely in my next build.
  You can just put a valve with a string and just pull on it with your front hand, no need for even a remote.

I like the car horn because people know when they hear it they need to move ass or die. Bicycle bells are also good. My scariest moments are from people crossing the road against the light without looking. One lady started crossing with her head down -- I planned a course way in front of her, but without looking up she started running! My one crash was from one of these incidents...

30mph I need something loud that people recognize, I don't have time to fuck around.

EDIT malfunction was due to intermittent mini deans -- swapped out for XT30, all good now.

Got it wired into the board now. A photo and a breakdown for others looking to do something similar.

Couldn't find a proper place for the horn itself (yet), so for now lol it's hanging off the front like a black round unicorn horn. The mounting tab on the horn is some soft metal, it's not gonna survive too long.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/wh54ypo02jgvoqv/ppm%20horn%20wiring.jpg?dl=0

I had crimp contacts that fit the horn tabs. The green thing is being used as a 12v BEC, XT60 taking power from the battery pack at 10s voltage. The green thing also has a 5v output that is unused here.

The little black connectors are mini deans.

The receiver, vesc connects to channel 2, the turnigy switch to channel 1. This switch acts as a momentary when I turn the wheel on the remote to the left.

I'm probably gonna cover the horn in heat shrink to protect from mud and maybe knock it down a few db. And I gotta find a better place to mount it up.

I'll probably heatshrink all the little electrical pieces together so they're in a neat bundle.

BTW this thing is a pain to test, annoys the whole neighborhood. :slight_smile:

mm i'm pretty sure i can mod my led circuit to use a horn/speaker.

but honestly I don't why you wouldn't put it on the remote instead of the board?
it simplifies so much!

I agree with wanting a bell or horn like the metroboards have but I also agree it's much simpler to put it on the remote.  And while we are talking remote -- remotes need to run on an 18650 cell already, not sure why none do

I think you missunderstood me. it would still be hand activated, and much more reliable if it was in the remote.

a couple of my custom remotes did, but they get bulky and unless you have high power leds in the remote, charging becomes so rare its actually less convenient because you go months without need to plug in....then forget, then dead on a ride :(

Update. The metal bracket broke off in about 4 days. I've got it gaffer taped to the board for now, but as expected the output is greatly attenuated. Will play with various mounting schemes and report back if I find something usable.

So this morning some guy walked into the crosswalk against the light without looking. I had room but thought I'd test the horn. This is with all the tape so it's pretty quiet. Beep, and the guy looks up, gets a really pissed expression on his face and starts cursing at me. Hmmm, not the reaction I was expecting...

I cut some of the tape off, the decibels are up near usable levels now. I'll see how long the gaffer's tape lasts...

I'm probably ordering this and attaching to remote.

The car horn with gaffer tape is holding up lol. Was very helpful today. This time an Asian lady suddenly starts running across the road without looking. BEEP! She took a full second to react, but fast enough to save our asses.

I've had this happen to me a few times, I don't understand this behavior. It's very scary because if they look up and see me they'll stop or slow down, so I have to find room to go in front of them or waaay behind them.

I'm gonna see if the tape holds on until the 3d printer comes in...
