Hi All,

I stumbled upon this deal on AliExpress today, do you think it is too good to be true? Does anybody have ever purchased 30Q from this store?

What is the recourse if they aren't real and you find out after you've spent all the effort to make a battery and testing it reveals it doesn't quite perform up to spec?  Can you get your money back?  What about all your time?  What about the time you're out a vehicle?  Will they give you a loaner esk8?  Is the seller in your country and legally reachable?

I don't think it's worth finding out.  But that's just my opinion.

Samsung produce "INR18650-30Q" and these say "ICR18650 - 30Q" so there are 2 extra spaces and a different chemistry - lithium cobalt oxide instead of lithium manganese nickel

2.4+taxes+possibly fake

nkon is 3.06 without vat so not much of a difference and you will get legit cells

I've bought from them. Its been a few days over a month and I still haven't received them. Everything else I ordered at the same time as the batteries have arrived...

In the states: 
Lionwholesale for 100 or less, IMR for 100 or more (by 30Q cell price, shipping is somewhat equivalent) 

NKON is considerably cheaper however shipping is a wreck ( at least 33$ to Los Angeles)
