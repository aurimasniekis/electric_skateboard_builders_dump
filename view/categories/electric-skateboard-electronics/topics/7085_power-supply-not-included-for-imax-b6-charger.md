I got [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0023Y9EQC/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687542&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B009VDPNXQ&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=TW0WN3MJMAQ4XZJYR9GC) one but it seemed like it was used so I would suggest getting a different one. Also it gets dangerously hot if you charge batteries at 5 amp. Get something that is a bit more expensive.

I would suggest just getting the iMax B6 V2, then you don't need a power supply. Just plug and play :slight_smile:
