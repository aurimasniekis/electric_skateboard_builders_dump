I’m new to the forum and don’t really know how it works??

This is what I posted?? Have you any ideas in the problem I’m having??

Regards Ben .

Hi all I have set up my motors with the latest vesc tool, it was very simple so that was nice, the only thing is that one motor seems to be a lot faster (higher rpm) than the other?? Also they don’t seem to be very well synchronised with each other?? One motor has thicker cables coming from it, which makes me think maybe they have different kv ratings?? I have attach the Foc pictures from the motors from the vesc set up?

Could any1 please help with this?

Many thanks Ben Ps, this is my first build so I’m not to good with electronics?

You'll need to tell us what motors you're using and preferably pics

If is VERY ill-advised to use different motors...they will need custom gearing and will likely wear down unevenly...and it will always turn to one side more than the other unless you can match the torque

I’m using alienpowersystems 8085 out runners 250kv, 2x vesc 6, 2x 6s 10000mah In series (12s), alien remote and reciver.

You can upload it elsewhere and link it

The wires look the same to me...how much thicker is the one?

Do you have a multimeter? if so read the resistances between the different motor wires. (so motor 1 A-B, A-C, B-C....) those should all be roughly  the same

Edit: perhaps more resistance in the bearings/direct drive can cause one motor to spin less free, causing it to stop earlier and make it appear to spin slower.

One look like a 10 aug (Faster motor on the left as you look at board from the rear)
The other looks like a 12aug?

Yes I have a multimeter, I will try that, so if the motors have different resistances then the windings could be different, making the kv ratings didferent??

When I turn the wheels with my hand they spin ok, not a lot of resistance?

yes, that could be the case, or maybe there is an internal short of some sorts. Did you get the motors from the Alienpower website, if so just ask @ALIENPOWERSYSTEM1  he is a nice guy

that doesn't say much, only that you do not have broken bearings or magnets

Yes I did, and have emailed them, Bruno from alienpowersystems said that one of the motors might be sound wrong from the factory?? He said that he would send me a new motor to try??
