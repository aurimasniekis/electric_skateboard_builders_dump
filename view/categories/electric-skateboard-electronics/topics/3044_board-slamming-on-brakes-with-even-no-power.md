I just left to go riding and had the two motors going full throttle just now without my trying to.  Repeatedly.  So I unplugged my battery and go pushing it and it keeps slamming on the brakes now!  
Next time I get everything going I'm potting it all.  This is deadly even with no power.

@Hummie  if you disconnected the batteries, the only way the brakes can engage is if the motor wires are shorting. If two or more of the contacts at the end of your motor wires touch each other, breaking occurs.

Maybe I'm crazy. It was the receiver wires going into the vesc. I'm too rough and have to get it off the bottom of the board.
