After weeks of riding trough salty weather the first VESC died :smiling_imp:.  I used it for at least a year in FOC, no problems at all. As you can see it went trough a lot.....

Wow look like a nice challenge üòú... And hope there is not so much of corrosion under this salty crust... The last one I have seen with these kind of damage was damage beyond repair (well, it as also pass a few hour submerge in salty water).

Edit: here a picture of it

Oh my heart bleeds when I see this kind of stuff :cry: :joy:

It is a tvs diode, to protect the curcuit against overvoltage.

Is this a long term solution for upgrading to direct fet üòù

Just wondering,

‚Ä¶..how?! :confused:
I've never seen an epoxy case worn in that bad- Or at all, for that matter.
