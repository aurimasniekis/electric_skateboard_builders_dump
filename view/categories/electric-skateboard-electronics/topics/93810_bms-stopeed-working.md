Hello, I have this BMS https://de.aliexpress.com/item/10-S-13-S-36-V-48-V-40A-60A-Lithium-Batterie-Schutz-Bord-Elektrische-Fahrrad/32888307335.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.31044c4dsbR1gm for 10S LiPo setup with 60A continuous. I wired it for **charging and discharging**. It worked great and I could charge the packs without a problem, also during riding I had no problems at all. When I plugged it in to charge it the third time (used it 2 charges and about 30km before) it just **didn´t charge**, the chargers light stayed green all the time and also the discharging is not working anymore, I **can´t power it on, the BMS blocks all the power from the charger to the batteries as well from the batteries to the VESC**. If I connect the charger without BMS it charges straight away, also if I wire the BMS for charging only, the VESC gets power and turns on. I measured all cells and they are between **3.63 and 3.67, one cell is 3.57**, could this be the problem? On my last ride, everything was fine, the batteries had about 20% left and I turned the board off. After about one hour I was going to charge it and nothing happened. Very strange that everything worked before, so anything must have happened between the turn-off and plugging in the charger. I use a loop key with XT90S Antispark. The BMS never got hot and I can´t see any burned marks or something like this. Any idea what could be wrong and how I can recover the BMS or is it broken? Thanks
