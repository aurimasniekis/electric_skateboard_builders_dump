Just a heads up to everyone. Maytech is just about to start selling VESCs.

Quote from an email: 
> The new style VESC for E-skateboard are released this week
> In the attachment, please refer to the pictures.

Here's the attachment:

Here is the listing on alibaba: https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-VESC-for-wireless-remote-controlled_60468516909.html?spm=a2700.7724838.0.0.ZiZuMy
The price is pretty much in line with with other vesc sellers ranging from $30-$100. Not sure about cost of shipping, but I have already messaged them about that. The shortage for vesc is no more if these ones prove to be decent.

Let's not forget the VESC is an open source design for which Benjamin Vedder should be credited. Profusely.
I am against buying VESC's from a Chinese outsider to the esk8 DIY scene because they surely won't be donating anything to the further development of the VESC. Just leeching.

@trbt555 I agree that Vedder should be profusely credited, and I of course want to support our DIY community, but this is how open source is meant to work in my view. I don't think that Vedder meant for VESC to be used exclusively by the DIY community. Every new VESC manufacturer opens the door for further innovation. We don't donate to Linus Torvald for every flavor of Linux that's released, right?

Disclaimer: I am not chinese. But this to me sounds like a racist/generalized attack on them. True, many chinese manufacturers are shit and cut corners wherever they could but this does NOT mean ALL of them will. You saying that all of them will is like saying all Asians are good at math or all white people are arrogant and ignorant, which as you know are both terribly wrong.  Anyways, my point being that you can't just judge a company/manufacturer based on its race, origin or stereotypes, you have to take many factors into account. Maytech, from what I know has been pretty solid with their products and contributions..so for now, lets just see how things go before we all make a fool out of ourselves

Though not E-Board related, I bought what would be a clone of the New 3DS XL, which runs Android, to play emulators. Looks and feels great. Took everything into account when making it. It really surprised me.
It's called the GPD XD.

```
About 80% of all electronics we use are produced in china. And we use those products so they work. There are however lots of reasons why a product could work or fail. A few common reasons why "Chinese" products fail are quality control, choosing different components than specified and worst of all fake/cloned components (BIG issue because some (often american) components are not allowed to be sold / sourced in china and therefore; fake components are a temping option). 

I designed 3 products that are produced in china ( 1k units on one of the products and 2x50 for the others ). The 1k production went perfect, I think mainly because production was strictly guided from the Netherlands ( most components where sourced here and send to China ) and cost was no issue.

For the two other products we faced the issue that the power supply on the board failed above >10Volts (but functioned <10V perfectly), it just went up in smoke or didn't work at all. I did build a few prototypes and verified that with the specified components the supply should accept a input voltage up to 30V. The issue ended up to be fake texas instruments power supply chips. With this production lower component cost meant more profit for the supplier.

The main point I learned (from fellow engineers as well) -> If the people sourcing the components make money by saving cost you most likely end up with a less to non functional product. And if company "image/reputation" has no value (the case for consumers as costumers) the result is even more likely to be BAD. :P.

I don't think Maytech is all too terrible from the interaction I've had with them thus far. I've ordered 4 motors from them, so we'll see what they're like, but so far they have been very professional and even sent me engineering drawings of the motors on request.

We'll see about the quality of their products, but from what I know a couple of people are using Maytech motors and I haven't seen any bad press. They have an engineer setting up the production of their VESCs, so I suspect the quality will be of a reasonable standard. I don't judge a premature picture of their offering, I'll judge the product that I buy when it's officially listed on their website.

I have made 3 VESC's manually, the costs for me were 100 euro each (parts cost, no labor), I used premium parts. So for anyone selling under that cost -> they will be out of business soon or they compensate somewhere I think there is no room for compensation.

@ JTAG
I do think your reasoning is sound there.
With these components it makes a huge, and I do mean huge, difference whether you buy 10 or 10 000.
Maytech will be buying (and may well be group buying) on a whole different scale, direct from manufacturers. Even Enertion who is buying on a much smaller scale can sell (not produce as he is not doing it out of the goodness of his heart) his VESCs cheaper than 100 Euros. Would be implying that he is using inferior components?

But please don't believe or convince others you can buy a decent quallity vesc below 100€.

So you believe that both DIY Electric and Enertion both sell inferior VESC's?
They both sell VESCs below 100 Euros - and that is with their profit margin included.
I am not trying to convince anyone to buy anything, just saying I believe your calculations are based on low quantities. 
In my opinion it is quite possible, looking at the components, to get decent quality at a more reasonable price if a bigger player comes into the equation.

```
The VESC is spec'd with really expensive components. I think you assume too much when considering the price drop on bulk purchasing. The capacitors and major components are still very expensive when purchased in bulk. 

They will obviously be using substandard caps as any other VESC does in this price range so you will likely see a lot of failures when used in the higher voltage systems.

Having said that, I think this is a perfect time for a large company to start producing the VESC and getting these to the masses. V5 will be out soon and anyone actively involved in the development will be moving on.
```

## \#35 Posted by: JTAG Posted at: 2016-05-24T15:02:13.841Z Reads: 468

```
They either use low cost component OR they make little to none money OR a combination of both ( likely). They either hurt themselves directly (by selling at cost) or hurt themselves in the long run (warranty claims -> bad image). 

I don't even take the VESC's into account that fail by user error. There will be even more failures, they might claim warranty as well.

Producing in large quantities is also less desirable since about every year there is a significant HW design update rendering the sourced expensive components useless.

Let this be an eye opener: you need at least a margin factor of 1.6  to stay in relaxed business / healthy (here in the NL at least, but I think in generall).

Yes, and I say that from my experience and the experience of others on this forum. I bought 2 from enertion, one came broken, other broke the second day during normal use. Many others have similar stories. I'm sure many haven't had an issue, but many on here also have complained of a similar experience. My personal opinion is they are cheap Chinese crap. This is why some on here refuse to repair them also, as you fix one thing and another problem pops up. Now that you guys talk about knock off components, I wouldn't be surprised if they did have knockoff components, because there's no reason they should break like they did for me (and others). Same settings with chaka's vescs, been running solid for months so far. That's the difference between cheap Chinese factory made and American hand made. I hope the next batch from enertion goes better, as they are US made, but like JTAG said, it's expensive to build a vesc with good quality components, so as I look at it now, you get what you pay for. If you choose the cheap route, you rolling the dice. You either get a good one or you get unlucky, and lost $90-100.

Chaka was selling his at $110, but his new price is $150. I do agree that it is possible for Maytech to sell at $100( more like $125 with shipping included). Enertion latest batch of vesc is manufactured in the US, and I believe most if all not of the components are from Mouser. His new batch uses Nichicon caps, which is the same brand as Chaka's vesc so the quality is more than likely the same.

He's saying vendors who sell them for under $100 are. chaka is sorta setting the standard for a quality vesc right now. Even with maytechs shipping of around $25, even if they use quality components, I will spend the extra $25, and get piece of mind knowing that if it breaks, it will be fixed at little to no extra cost for me.

First of all, I know your being sarcastic, but... The original comment that everything from china is crap is sort of racist. I don't think that the term "cheap Chinese crap" is racist, because it's common knowledge and well accepted that there's a lot of cheap Chinese factories cutting corners and build crappy products. There's good factories there too. I'm sure many of my computer parts are likely made there, and I've had my laptop for almost 6 years now, having used it for hours everyday, getting it way too hot overclocking everyday, and dropping it in the worst ways possible from height without much more than a scratch. The engineering is half the battle IMO. But quality stuff can come from china, so saying all Chinese stuff is crap is racist. That I have not said, because from my experience, it's not true.

@ evoheyax
This is what I was actually getting at. Just because it comes from China does not make it crap. (Possibility of course but if they do it right, and Maytech make decent motors from what I have heard, they may provide a decent VESC at a decent price. Time will tell)

I personally have two VESCs from chaka and I know they are good as I have had zero problems with them.

Another from a different source and that one works but runs a lot warmer.

I never said that you said that. I was referring to the comment that sparked this whole discussion.

Yes, when it comes to eboard stuff, there's a lot of Chinese crap, but it's an undeveloped market. This industry is so new, that few people have had the time and resources to start a decent sized company that can get a good factory to make large quantities with good quality (like how sony, or lg, or samsung does it). Yes, it's possible maytech could make some good vesc's. I would be (and am) skeptical of their quality, as most Chinese eboard stuff on the market is trash. Again, not everything. My space cell was made in china, and I have to say, despite it not being high amp enough for me, I've yet to have any issues, even with me semi abusing it by bypassing the bms, and pulling more amps then it really wants. Same can be said with enertions motors, rock solid, and to my understanding (correct me if I'm wrong), they are china made.

@WeeChumlee My whole point was that not everything from china is crap, but it's not being sold by an eboard company, I'm even more skeptical than normal. They will likely cut corners, use cheap parts, and break quickly. The VESC (idk if because of the way they are normally used, or by design flaw, or because so many cheap ones have been made) seem more fragile than other electronics. Good quality components seem to eliminate most of these problems. And we have yet to see a quality vesc come from china, nothing but garbage as far as I'm concerned.

@chipoi84 I was refering to the smd caps on the circuit board. 

@WeeChumlee When I first started manufacturing the VESC I was basically selling it at cost. I have never used sub-standard parts, in fact I have over spec'd a few of the smd capacitors in order to make the VESC more robust.

 I am glad you are enjoying a solid VESC from OllinBoardCo and that you can see the difference in quality.  Please know that we are all really small companies and yes we rely on a certain amount of customer loyalty to stay in business. We get this customer loyalty because we contribute to the sport. This takes time, effort and money. 

There will always be the consumers who try to save every penny they can in order to get what they want and that is ok. There will always be an overwhelming amount of consumers that will gladly support those who drive the sport forward.

The reality is these VESC's are likely not even made in China. The age of cheap product from china is coming to an end. Swarmy manufacturing is moving to other developing nations with cheaper labor, India being the main focus of this shift.

@evoheyax
Maybe I did not come across as I would have hoped - I was agreeing with your point.
@chaka
Yup, happy with your product and am quite aware of how business works and what it costs. 
I am in the electronic business myself - I have it easy though as I am not self employed  :slight_smile:

The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
@delta_19
I suppose it is all down to you mate. If you get one I hope it is a good product at a decent price.
If so we, the consumers, all win  with affordable VESCs.

The development of the next generation VESC V5 is already in full swing and that is great. A decent product for the masses though is what is need now. Once the masses are happy with the VESC they may want the next generation.

Anyway, my only criticism in this thread was the generalisation that everything from China is crap, that is simply not true. A lot, yes, agreed. I live in hope though. It may be great and we can be happy. I will only shoot it down if it proved  to be crap quality, not beforehand on the assumption that it will be.

I live in China since 2 years. still most things here are crap. (thts the sad reality, not racism)

Based on reviews, @chaka has the most reliable here...but he also puts has put in the most work per piece...something that would be difficult to replicate  

Only way I can see them being able to make a quality product is to over spec it...but from my understanding it is the dvr chip that seems to fail often...please correct me if I'm wrong....plus how will they be able to support the device?

I wasn't joking when I said that I was negotiating with Eileen from Maytech. Very professional. Very aggressive at trying to get a PI going, but I respect that. Wouldn't be doing her job if she wasn't landing sales. I'm kind of sketch about the Maytech VESC because when I ask specific questions I get different answers at different times. That and he pics look pretty rough. Maytech is good for motors and Steez remotes...IMO
For me, I just bought a couple of VESC from Ollinboardco because I want my money to make a statement about my dedication to quality and support his contributions to our community. Yeah, it's more expensive, but don't think about it that way. It costs what it costs and if there were no alternatives, people would gladly pay the admission. The alternatives may be cheaper, but they may also be unsafe. Substandard parts and poor assembly could legitimately cause a catastrophic failure! Runplayback's bro, Robbie, just got hurt pretty bad from an ESK8 accident, so we should all keep our heads clear and make every effort to be safe. It starts with the components.

1. for science
2. because they are cheap
3. because one is crazy
4. to prove how good @chaka etc. VESCs truly are

I guess there are a couple more reasons but after seeing how expensive they still are (keep in mind the listed prices were without shipping) I just don't see it either.
For like 30-40$ I could see this being a valid option (if one breaks you just get another) but the parts alone are probably more than that. It probably comes down to who has the better marketing now. Maytech can probably push this to a bigger audience that does not know about "our" suppliers.

Hell No.  I would buy from a reputable person or company first.  If the hassles Jason/Onloop went through are any example (and i think they are) of the chinese build quality - i'm talking about the first order where they substituted cheaper "equivalent" components - i would avoid this no matter how cheap.  Or buy the PCB's and components yourself and learn how to reflow one yourself!

Anyone know what Enertion's VESC specs are?

Anyway - http://www.circuitrework.com/guides/7-1-3.shtml

They are all pretty similar. Anyone have any experience comparing class 1 to class 3 in active practice? 

I doubt it would make much difference on the VESCs in practice.

In fact I'm pretty much willing to bet that Enertion's 'American' VESCs are class 2 or lower. As an electro mechanical engineer looking at the differences between those, class 3 is hyper unnecessary for most every field of application and would cost about 10 times more than class 1.

@Dedbny I've ordered 4. I'll post a review when I get them. I've actually got pretty high hopes. Every interaction I've had with Maytech thus far has been pretty professional and confidence inspiring and if they're willing to spend that much on customer service, their products must be pretty decent too. Their VESCs will most likely carry very similar warranties to all of their other products. And I'm pretty sure that covers failures within normal and expected use criteria.

## \#117 Posted by: makepeace Posted at: 2016-06-09T20:23:17.335Z Reads: 311

The design of the VESC really isn't rocket science. I would say that failures have mostly been caused by on the line design (no disrespect to Ben Vedder here), and not by producers. It's an amazingly powerful tool, but it's not been designed for production, as with most open source projects. He's done an amazing job at doing any suiting manufacturers' homework, but at the end of the day, it's been designed to solder in your bedroom with the ability and time to debug every joint, not on a production line of 1000s. If manufacturers want to make this work on that level, they are either going to have to front up on the production side, or reroll the board layout and some of the hardware design (ie the DRV chip is a hot component due for replacement). Making the VESC does not require magic. It's a very simple question of design for manufacture.

Oh wow. 

Great! 

Questions for you:

What's your justification for speccing class 3, no lower on a design like the VESC? 

What's the cost breakdown between class 1, 2 and 3 per board do you estimate?

Could the VESC be redesigned/spec'd so as to be susceptible to class 1 level production?

Are you rolling your own VESCs?
```

---
## \#121 Posted by: delta_19 Posted at: 2016-06-09T21:09:17.653Z Reads: 300

```
because now a days everything uses class 2 target minimum (minus cheap china shit like what maytech seems to be pushing)

in the long run class three is cheaper if you offer support. class 2 and 1 can break faster and will have more faults in testing. if you're trained to class 3 then less units will fail in test, and you will have less support work that will need to be done because you made a better product.

why the vesc should be class 3 is easy, do you want an electrical failure at high speeds? i dont.

and im not sure what you mean?
"Could the VESC be redesigned/spec'd so as to be susceptible to class 1 level production?"

no i have a TB ESC

Okay so I've ordered and paid for 4. At a really great price (Inc shipping). Not at liberty to say what I paid for them, but I guess you can find out by asking them. Best price I've seen so far.

They said the lead time at the moment is 30 days due to dev, and estimated 8-10 day shipping. Will probably be quicker if you order after mid July.

Will let you know about the quality when I get them.

I expect Maytech to be able to deliver on their estimate, as I've had nothing but excellent service in the process of this and my previous order of 4 x 6355 230 Kv high power motors for also an excellent price. 

Great experience so far and I'm sure I won't be disappointed.

As mentioned, there is nothing special about this board that is special from a manufacturing perspective, apart from its poor DFM.

This board doesn't need to be manufactured in America. And V5 that should be coming out in a couple of months will solidify this fact multiple times.

Good chinese manufacturers making their own profits will be able to do it better than US manufacturers. Mark my words. It may take a couple of months, perhaps less as they have engineers working on it, but it will happen fairly soon.

there is a massive hole in the market for VESC right now. whoever controls the VESC's controls the game right now.

I respectfully disagree, my friend. If cheap products come out at a low enough price point they will serve to destroy the very industry that we love. 
1. In order to meet the lowest price point, many compromises in the cost estimation stage will lead to poor quality. 
2. The cheaper quality reputation will take away from the business that is being done by artists like Chaka and Elkick. Such boutique level quality needs to be supported with $$$, but also word of mouth. 
3. The reputation of unreliability connected with Chinese parts will make us all look stupid. Remember Enertion?  Right now TB is going through some crap with Chinese VESC as well. 
How many times do we have to smash our heads into the wall before we get it? LOL 
A world full of poor quality, low cost parts doesn't attract me. It pisses me off.

Thanks @Ulfberht I appreciate your perspective. However, all of your arguments hinge on the assumption that Maytech VESCs will be a failure, which seems like a premature assumption to make. 

The position that Chinese products will inherently be low quality, simply because they are produced by a Chinese manufacturer, seems completely incorrect to me.

Even if this particular batch of VESCs turns out to be lousy, there is value in that to the broader market. It will secure the position of better manufacturers and regulate what is the acceptable level of quality is for this device.

Right now we've got three or four groups (maybe five?) manufacturing and selling VESCS, and they are all very small businesses with (presumably) very small R&D budgets. I stand by the position that at this point, any new manufacturer giving it a try and putting out a product is a good thing for our community.

This would be against the ideals of open source. The fact that you would even suggest such a thing is abhorrent to anyone involved in the open source movement. Hopefully we will have some sort of legal process in place to prevent people from doing such a thing in the future as the movement progresses.

Maytech is well within their rights and they are contributing immensely just by making these available. Sure, they are skimping on parts in an attempt to make them as cheaply as possible but you may have success with them if you stick to 6s or 8s as a max voltage. The cheaper smd caps should still perform within spec at these lower voltages.

Hardware you are providing a service. Besides, I donated huge sums of money from profits directly to Vedder.

You "can" charge for a ported version of the bldc-tool but nothing is stopping your first customer from redistributing it for free.

Basically, if you want royalties you need to start from the bottom and develop the code from the ground up otherwise you need to make the source code freely available.

You're totally right. It is a bit premature to assume they will be a failure. I'm gonna take a step back on that and not get too eager to judge based on all of the previous Chinese VESC fiascos. They could be alright, for all I know at this juncture. I digress...

I thought this was another circle jerk thread, but now I think it just highlights the exact friction point that exists in any DIY-space. I've got nothing to contribute about e-skate design and building until I finish my forum research and learn by building my own, so I'm trying to contribute in a different way by adding to the conversation. 

There is always  a constant push-pull against commercialisation. With ongoing bottom-up DIY dev, the best DIY ideas float to the surface, DIY gets behind idea or product so demand increases, demand outstrips supply, small scale DIY's commercialise to support the group, prices are high because scale is small, non-DIY commercialisation takes place because scale can increase which brings prices down and can allow a larger market in, competition heats up, DIY complains because it's no longer DIY, DIY goes back to finding the next big improvement and the best DIY ideas float to the surface... rinse and repeat.

I saw this years ago in the DIY fuel injection scene and its almost an exact analogue (slightly different no doubt). What made that scene work long term was the decisions the community made to take it forward. Quick history for context: Commercial Fuel injection units existed but while they were good, they were closed-source, un-affordable, and/ or not customisable outside of whatever they were built for (think Boosted or Evolve perhaps)- and afforded almost no learning/ hobby opportunities. 2 smart blokes called Bowling and Grippo (B&G) built an open source ECU which was better than all the commercial ECUs (think Vedder), but you had to build it yourself, and you had to learn it via endless forums searches, and everything supporting it had to be fabricated by hand. Eventually a couple key enthusiasts improved the learning by writing a comprehensive free online manual (a bit like onloop did in places early on, now others, but much more comprehensive and cohesive). B&G deserved some return on their amazing work and contribution, so they licensed the PCBs design (even though the design itself and all software was open)- and sold the license to people who thought they could manufacture the PCBs at a high quality (to protect the community from rubbish). Most people decided to only buy the PCBs from community sources like DIYauttune.com ( think DIYelectricskateboards.com, or Ollinboards, or Enertion)). That meant they got paid, so ongoing dev and support occurred. The price B&G charged to license was just small enough to make ongoing version improvements worth their time, and to keep their solution affordable to hobby-centric people. Clones emerged, but no community support was given, because it would kill the community long term if B&G stepped away. While the PCB was licensed, the firmware to drive it was all open source. Next came the software, all good having this great ECU but the open source software was intermittently maintained (because someone had to donate time to do it) and focused on bare basic functionality with a high learning curve (think BLDC tool, IDK, I haven't read the history behind it). Along came a community DIY Fuel Injection guy with programming skills called Phil Tobin (maybe think Jacob). He wrote a closed-source cross-platform tuning software called Tunerstudio which he could design because the firmware on the ECU was open, and due to effort, dev cycles and support, changed the face of the whole scene. Because he knew the ECU design inside out, and he knew what the community wanted inside out, his product was excellent. He sold it super-cheap compared to the big brands, and it was specific for the B&G ECU. Lots of people complained initially because it was less DIY and not open source, but after a year or two no one was using or updating the bare bones software. The DIY scene moved forward to the point where the ECU and software together was/ is the best in the business, as long as you are prepared to learn and deal with the issues that arise when you add complex EFI to your old carby car in your garage. Other people popped up selling small parts needed to support DYI EFI like solenoids, wiring, brackets, connectors and fittings (think pyschcotiller, barajabli, hummer, miami et al), which for some was better than endless trips to the wreckers, or hours spent fabricating new or repurposing old parts. Many sold their parts through the few people who already had store web apps and logistical arrangements in place. Some people couldn't solder their own ECU but want to learn EFi anyway, so some people sold pre-made kits (think LHB). In the end, the community consisted of the full spectrum of DIY enthusiasts, and catered for the full range of skills people started with. Noobs (as long as prepared to self-learn), crafty enthusiasts, time poor but wealthy and interested participants (pre-built), creative experts, racers, community businesses. This diversity was important for longevity and momentum. This is what a 'movement' is and what people like belonging to.     

My point is this is all part of a healthy DIY environment, and if the DIY EFI scene was anything to go by, it does need just enough community loyalty and support, and preferably community-led and supported  commercialisation, to make it thrive long term. Not enough commercialisation and the place stagnates with tupperware container battery cases and flaky escs. Not enough community loyalty and cohesion and the DYI-lead development cycles die eventually die out, because the smart people move on. Open source is awesome, but does also have it's own challenges if there is no positive feedback loop to incentivise keeping it alive. Open source products can be built on and commercialised in a healthy way too. Finally, capitalising on DIY business opportunities is good, but how you do it also matters to the community.

Hello everyone,

I'm new here. I will be starting my first build next month when my TB motors and VESCs come in.

I'm a computer science student, so i'd like to share my two cents about open source code. While everybody here has a valid point, the ultimate goal of open source is to spread word of mouth about your software by offering it for free, then charging Enterprises for a premium service once you become big enough. Enterprises like Maytech. Being upset about another company using your open source code is small potatoes in the software industry. Since Vedder is one of the most experienced in programming e-skate esc software, he may one day develop software that is not open source, and companies like Maytech will have to pay to use it.

And that's how you make a shit ton of money with open source.

With that being said, how about that Maytech VESC review? lol

@Dedbny No, there were no timing issues with the other supplier at all. The other supplier wasn't able to cater for the need to change my order of 3 to an order of 4. I didn't have a problem with being pushed to the back of the queue either. The other supplier childishly ended up cancelling my order and then baiting me with an offer of 4 VESCs for the original price, but they never followed through with that so I decided to go elsewhere. All I can think is that they were trying to play some psychological game to prove themselves right or something. Who knows.

I imagine when they are ready to sell en mass that the 30 day lead time will not apply. So I would say it would be very favourably comparable with the other suppliers lead times.

Yes, i think the main concern is Customer service.
At this stage, the question is not if a VESC fails, but when.(Except mybe overbuilt vescs like @chaka or @elkick ones).
In this case you need Customer service (or simply buy a new one, wich is easier with bms as they are cheaper)

I agree with @flatsp0t;

I had a chaka vesc running create for months (I bought one before he even offered the heatsink package), and just out of the blue when I was riding my board lost power and came to a halt. 

Sent it back and got it repaired, but still, it shows any vesc can go south on you.

Our customers are responsible for building [Ollin Board Company](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com) so we do our best to take care of them. Difficult to say how long we will provide a service warranty on VESC's but we plan on offering a 2 to 4 year warranty on our complete decks, maybe longer. Difficult to say this early in our development.

You need to use google chrome, also although you can ship to USA using Taobao, its EXTREAMLY difficult, there are still some pages that can't be translated, including the shipping page, so it's difficult to fill it out. Most people do not use Taobao, a few will use an agent who will purchase it for you and then send it to you internationally, and even fewer will attempt to buy directly from Taobao.

Even the cheapest build seems to be $5-600 dollars so we are talking a 4% discount on the total build cost at best.

Your point is well taken, however there is a long history of Chinese manufacturing companies using substandard parts in order to maximize profits. In many instances the designers have no clue until it is too late. They are small companies and cannot afford a QA staff overseas. Large companies have QA staff on site watching and testing incoming batches 24/7 like Intel, Apple etc. Chinese companies unfortunately have a bad wrap because the story has repeated itself far too many times. Good production is possible with proper QA. This has no bearing on Asians. Every single one I have met and dealt with are good hard working people.

Been away from the forum for a while. I've got mine and they are rocking my Maytech 6355s to 55 km/h. :grin:. 

No issues so far after about 50 hours heavy use.

Build quality is also excellent. Although I don't have any VESCs for comparison, they meet my standards from my experience of other PCB equipment.

Some photos (I took off the plastic wrapping and their branding sticker. No disrespect, Maytech :kissing_heart:):

Yeah, it is really cool of them. That's how it should be with open source stuff! Glad that they are paying homage.

As to how many VESCs, I ordered a few.

I don't know their full price drop policy, however they seem pretty generous. It's not available on their website, and neither are their prices, but their ordering instructions are that you contact them for a quote.

So, if you are interested in their product and want to know more details, I would suggest that you send them an email and ask them for a quote, as that is how they operate.

There's a big price difference ordering a few components and ordering thousands tough.
For example, the mosfets (IRFS7530) if you buy 1 its 5.27$ if you buy 1000 its 2.78$, as you can see its almost half price. Even without going that high in numbers, 100 units are 3.88$ so still quite a difference if you're producing VESCs vs making a few for your own.

If everyone is making them now, then they will become competitively priced which means the price will have to drop more to stay competitive which means cheaper parts and thinner margins and then we're right back where we were with only two premium vesc providers who want four times the price of these guys. 

I want some middle ground. The last batch of Enertion vescs were solid, i still have a half dozen of them and i'm going to be out soon. Maybe i should just have my own made and say fuck it.

@longhairedboy Thinner margins an cheaper parts does not necessarily mean higher failure rates. The  new VESC design is going to be out soon and will most likely be easier and cheaper to manufacture with high quality. What's so great about this whole open source thing is that you can pay a reasonable price for mass production at 95% reliability and a high price for 99% reliability and good supplier guarantees. That enables a very healthy market.

Just got mine. The shipping was 14$, but the combined price was still <70 usd due to the 11/11 sale. I think there will be another sale on 12/12, so look out. 

I'll post a full review after I can do some testing, but my initial impression is that this looks good! It included a few accessories (including a sensor cable connector). The quality looks good so far. Very impressed. 

If I end up liking it from my review I may also post a taobao buying guide as it's a valuable resource too.

I just got two Maytech VESCs from the group buy. Both of them broken, apparently. I get the DRV 8032 error whenever I regen brake. Incidentally, the same settings on DIY's VESCs work perfectly fine.

@faust  Would you mind describing your settings when your vescs brake? Were you using foc? Rpm limit? 12s? Current limit?
This could be very helpful to other people who have a maytech vesc. Thanks.

Let's see, I had a single motor in FOC mode. +/-50A for the motor, battery max 20A, default RPM limit, 10s and 12s. The problem reproduced in a variety of settings. 

It's strange, I note in the Maytech documentation for the vesc that the battery current needs to be *more* than the motor max. This seems strange to me, but I wonder if they made some configuration constraints so that they could build this with cheaper components.

The reason for your failure is mainly FOC (plus some other reasons that maybe @Ackmaniac can explain to you)

I used to provide a translation for the info-sheet that maytech gave to me: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/flash-sale-left-over-parts-from-groupbuy-begins-now-see-post-557/13449/349?u=fedestanco

I am sorry for your vescs .Next time beware that FOC can be trusted with very few vescs out there.

It's needs a c26 chip correct? To run in FOC, maytech dosent have them so they would need to be hand soldered.

My two Maytech VESC's should be at my doorstep in a few days and I was very keen to try them with my 12S LiPo's and my Carvon V2.5's on FOC since I'm aiming for a stealthy board.

I would also be interested if I can adapt the Maytech VESC's to "safely" allow FOC mode, does anyone have an idea how to realize this?

I'm currently selling maytech VESCs for $90 and am sending vedder $10 for each sold. They are on my site for anyone who wants a cheap entry to vesc land. They have current firmware and work. FOC works too! But they say don't do it. (I don't listen)  We have used a few with no issues. Not saying it won't happen! Also not saying I'm going to replace them. Entry level is entry level. You get what you pay for. Wan't a warranty on electronics buy from Chaka. I have and still do buy from Chaka. I also buy from DIY. 

For the record, I have burned out DRV's from both of them. Both of them took care of the problem. You have to know you are going to burn out DRV's. Guaranteed.

Oh wow, these VESCs don't support FOC? Why would I ever buy a VESC that doesn't support FOC? Why would such a product even exist? That's a pretty big limitation. 

I'll go try to get them working in BLDC mode out of curiousity, but I suppose even if these do end up working, they're not much use to me. Go stealth or go home :)

Thanks for your help in figuring this out, everyone.

I just ran some tests, and fortunately, both VESCs work fine with regen braking and everything in BLDC mode. @psychotiller, how did you set up your Maytech's to work in FOC mode? I'm thinking of tempting fate further :)

Yeah, mine seem to be fine running foc...Not sure why I'm the only one allowed to run FOC.

I do bldc motor detection, apply the sensor settings.

Then I move to the foc tab and run the first 2 tests. hit calculate, apply on both of those, then run the sensor test and apply.

I then go to apps and disable the controller, set my ppm min and max.

From there I make sure my low voltage cutoff settings are good. Choose FOC on the motor tab, configure and go ride.

Hmm... FOC mode worked just fine for everything but braking. Its seems like the only difference between our steps was the fact that you set it up in BLDC mode first. What's did you use for voltage cutoff on 10s? Something like 32/30?

That's good to hear. Maybe it's the motor. I've got a single big 6374 on there, and I'm wondering if the Maytech's can't handle it. I'll try different motors and see if it helps.  

The key thing is that the same settings work just great on DIY's VESCs...

Could be...my Tacon 245kv's wouldn't do motor detection, but my 290kv g160 would. Consistency in batches is what I'm looking for. Maybe that's all it is.

I've got nothing but good things to say about maytech I purchased it and got it a week later through TNT the vesc was easy to set up and had bullet connectors already soldered 
I downloaded the bloc tool and the CEO Eileen contacted me via WhatsApp to check weather everything was ok   
She answered every question I had and came up with solutions to my problems 
For 100€ it's top quality 
My setup is 8s 290kv single drive and before going down I hit 52kmh or about 31mph

Maytech does not upload a bootloader which means you can't update if you don't upload one yourself.

Why do you need to load a bootloader? Just open BLDC 2.18 and do motor detection. They have all the pieces in place to do FOC now too! Too many people mess up their VESCs trying to change firmware when they don't need to.

I have some single hub trucks from maytech and want to buy a maytech 90mm 100Kv hub... and im trying to decide which esc to buy... it seems the maytech vesc is the best bet... they also said they can pre-program it to work well with their hub motors... seems like the easiest route...

also... what is FOC vs BLDC??? my only understanding of VESC's is that they are programmable ESC's usually within some sort of spec limitations...

Will the single 100kV hub motor have enough power?
Did Eileen or anyone from MayTech said how the new motor would compare to the previous 60kV?

Edit: Aah okkidokki, saw already
,but still, single 100kV can be real crapshoot on torque (?)..You need breaking aswell<:P
