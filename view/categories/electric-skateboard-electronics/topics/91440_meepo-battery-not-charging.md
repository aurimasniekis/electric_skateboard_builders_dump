Not exactly sure what has happened. Only have had this battery for like 3 weeks but now it has randomly stopped charging? Usually the power bank indicates a green light when fully charged, and red when low batter. Won't turn on anymore because the battery is entirely dead, but still indicates a green light when plugged in.

Might be the charger. Have you tried a different charger?

Or the voltage is so low the charger won't recognize it.

Sometimes you can plug the charger into the battery first, then plug the charger into the wall.  Doesn't always work, but sometimes if a charger is failing it will buy you some time.

wouldn't turn on, plugged it in and it'd turn back on for a few seconds then turn back off

Open the enclosure, it’s probably a loose connection

Yeah next thing to check would be the same
Jst connector that connects the port to the battery

You answered your own question there without realising.
Get a multi meter and test the voltage on the battery but I'm pretty sure your charger is fucked.  I've had 2 of those same chargers go on me and they displayed the same issues that you have described.

I mean it indicates it when its full, eh good to know its probably the charger and not the battery

it can also be the bms, when my bms failed all my chargers were showing green when plugged in, its kinda weird

I had similar issue with my meepo, they ended up sending me a new battery and my old one started working again after some shelf time...not sure exactly what was wrong...

I would not use that battery until you understand what caused that.

[/quote]

Usually when a bms fails its pretty obvious.  But yeah worth checking.  I've had 2 go and they went pretty spectacularly.  Melted shrink etc.  Not something I would plug my charger into.  They went riding and it was an event.  Chargers failing not so much.

You want the flaming board beneath your feet while doing 40 mph!!  Yeah!!  
It'll happen. 



 Give it time

That would have been what happened if the raptor hubs weren't so slow

They are not slow they just can't do 40mph.  No hub motor can and stay reliable.  Its a flawed design for high current.  Everyone knows this but some people have too much invested in said flawed design to change.  Why do you think tb got so much shit over their new drives?  

 Not rocket science.

Did you check the battery voltage?  Do it carefully though because its all to easy to short the probes when testing from the xt60.  I have an xt60 with 150mm of silicon wire and insulated bullet connectors on it so I can use the crocodile clip wiring from my multi meter.  Its safer than trying to stick the probes into the battery connector directly.  Sometimes you can get an arc across the probes and your meter is toast.  Scares the shit out of you too.
