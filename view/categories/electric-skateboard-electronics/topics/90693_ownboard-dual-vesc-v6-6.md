Figured would start a topic on this to get the discussion going.

For those not closely following this topic
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/elofty-direct-drive/77910

@Tetsu checked out upcoming products from Ownboard at the Hong Kong Show

Amoung their products was  VESC V6.6 based controller with an inbuilt receiver

Remote on the left is the well known HobbyWing controller that Ownboard and many others are currently using. On the right appears to be the remote for the VESC variant.

I am not extremely well versed in VESC's and variants but this seems like it could be rather promising and appears they have tried to build in some fail safes and protection. Might not have enough juice for a super high powered build but wondering if we might see this turning up on a heap of mid range boards soon.

We get it, you don't like anything being integrated together and would prefer every component being singular and increase the chance of compatible issues.

There are pro's and con's of integration, if your personal preference is that they are not, that is fine, that's your preference. Personally if it can be done reliably I want everything as integrated as possible. I'd much rather buy the ESC that comes with remote, receiver, power button, ect. Heck give it a couple more years and they may even integrate a BMS.

It just means it's not repairable when it breaks.  Not "if" it breaks.  Even the highest-quality builds break and need repair.  Not enough folks build for that.

Be honest tho, would you prefer to build with 5 x $50 parts vs 1 x $150 part if they can both do the same thing?

Like sure, one of your $50 parts breaks, your only out $50 to replace it vs the $150 part breaks your down $150 but what if the singular part is less likely to break? on the same circuit board is much more reliable then connecting several boards by JST connectors.

(Prices are just an example and are not accurate)

I don't think it's specifically a receiver(although could act as one when Ben makes that public). It looks like a nrf51 module. So that you can wirelessly program it from your phone. It's a welcomed addition, in my books.

[/quote]

I was just going off their spec sheet, 4.2 : Unique Features - received build-in PCB

My guess was that instead of adding a JST header for a receiver they just plopped one on the main board and had it connected on a PCB level. Hopefully it would allow pairing with other remotes so you have options but I use a thumb wheel anyway so as long as it was decent quality I'd still be okay with it.

I would much rather have my own separate parts. I could choose my own remote and change it when i want. The cost of the nano trigger remote (my favorite) is negligible. And as @b264 said, things break. Integration does not mean cost saving or time saving. It is more sleek and simple, but the peace of mind knowing i can cheaply replace a remote is much better

Even if you buy separate receiver, power button etc., which means you can not freely select different brand remote and ESC, because even not any brand VESC can be compatible with other brand remote and receiver. Build-in receiver and power button means you can easily install and use the VESC and conveniently maintain VESC in good condition.

Do you have factual produce experience?

@Eovan It does mean low quality, mainly because it's not very serviceable.  All esk8 break, and when they do, if you have stuff like that, you have to buy new stuff instead of repairing what you have.

It's the *"Save $5 now! (Pay $200 later)"* philosophy  

Why don't **you** delete *your* irresponsible words.  Do you sell cheap china hub motor boards?

Yeah, that's what I thought.

&ZeroWidthSpace;

If people want toys that work for a couple weeks, then maybe they want stuff like that.  But if people want tools that continue to work month after month and they can rely on them to get to work and back home, then they should not buy such cheap garbage.

@b264, they are selling a product that's easier to use and less prone to user error. I think that's a good thing. There are plenty of other vescs which have them separate, so people are free to choose what they feel like. 

However, what would make it better is if they have extra ports where people can connect their receiver of choice, if need be. @Eovan can we attach our own ppm/uart receiver's?

More options on the market is always good.  Built-in receivers brings up nightmares of repairing Evolve and Meepo.

We usually have similar views on things but not-serviceable  and low-quality are two independent things.

Sometimes makers of high quality stuff make it highly unserviceable just so that they can keep people from repairing it themselves. I don't like that either, but can't call it low-quality just because of that.

"Serviceable when it breaks" is one of many key indicators of quality.

All esk8 will break.  Do you want a paperweight or something you can get right back on the road?

[/quote]

I think you may be confusing quality with ease of user serviceability. Something does not need to be user serviceable to be of high quality and just because something is user serviceable does not make it high quality. I would rather a part that is unlikely to fail and a pain to repair if it does vs something that is easy to repair but needs to be repaired all the time.

Heck look at the current trend and uptake of gear drives to replace belt drives, if something breaks your replacing at minimum the full gearset vs just slapping a new belt on. But they are less likely to fail.

By all means hate on them all you like but might be a good idea to not discriminate against part of the community just because you don't like them or have had bad experiences with them. I dare say that some users may be reluctant to participate from fear of backlash because they ride a board that others look down on.

I bought an Ownboard W1S as my first Esk8 and it's currently my only Esk8 while I start building a custom board. Sure it's inferior to many boards, but I pulled it out of the box, checked the screws were tight, charged it up and rode it. I have put Señor Pepe front wheels on it and re-bushed it with some nipples and ride it every chance I get. So far it has been solid with no issues in sight, I dare say there are many DIY boards with much less Km's on them that cost more to build that are dead on someone's workbench.

Esk8 at the moment is similar to a bunch of cowboys in the wild west but that comes with the territory of it being such a new industry. The established and quality manufacturers just aren't there yet, some are getting closer tho. 

Maybe instead of pushing against change work towards guiding it. Built in proprietary receiver that only works with their own transmitter is bad, I think we can all agree on that. Setting a standard for receivers that is adopted by all manufacturers which enables the end user to choose whatever transmitter / controller they want and pairing it with the built in receiver is good.

Integration is easier and cheaper to produce.  Thats the bottom line and theres absolutely no benefit to it for the end user just the manufacturer.   They don't want you running out and picking up a small component from a rival to get their board going again.  They want you to buy a new whole unit from them in the event of a failure. 
Really not worth the debate because its plain and simple strategic business modelling.

Easier and cheaper to produce, totally agree.

Absolutely no benefit to it for the end user just the manufacturer tho ? I'd disagree on that and don't believe that you truly believe that either. Integration (a more complete product) has many benefits to the end user and I would say some of the mindset demonstrated in this thread is simply resistance to change.

Take a skate truck for example, you don't buy a hanger, base plate, king pin, pivot cup & bushings separately, you buy them as a complete. If they were sold individually the makers need to make profit on each so the end result is a higher final price. You also end up with compatibility issues. Sure you can change some parts but most people prefer to buy a complete solution if it's available and if the axle in your Caliber hangers gets messed up the whole hanger goes in the bin and you get another one.

How about the Unity? seems to be very well received from the community despite that you shell out your money and wait a couple months before getting anything and it's still based on V4 hardware. What makes it appealing? it's a product that suits most people's needs, is an integrated solution with power switch, push to start, dual esc & onboard bluetooth in a compact package that doesn't let out the magic smoke at the first sign of trouble.

Now potentially this could have most of the features of the Unity, be based on V6.6 hardware not V4 and instead of trying to make sure you have the correct cable and finding somewhere to mount your receiver could just bind your favorite controller (pending compatibility). Surely most have already adopted one of the RC standard's so should just be a case of binding the remote to the receiver ?

Heck being Ownboard they may even be able to keep them in stock and have delivery within a couple weeks of taking your money. They may end up being trash, but they may not be.

Possibly the worst example you could have used.
If I break a 50 degree base plate, I have 4 others I can quickly swap out to get me back rolling.
If I break a hanger then I have again at least 3 I can adapt to fit.  I'm rolling again.
Bushings wear out well then I just change the bushings.    You get the picture.

Glad you brought up the unity because again it highlights my point too.
I use focboxes predominately because they have shown the best resilience to abuse of any vesc derivative I have used so far.  The unity, while being a good product(so far) is a combined dual focbox.  Thats really all it is with some additional features.  Great!  Will it be the industry standard its un conjoined brother is?  Yet to be really tested but the forecast looks good.
Does it cost as much to produce as 2 focboxes?  
No.  Of course it doesn't, it uses one standard layout pcb and one casing.  Component cost is negligible.  Manufacturing of the unit is much easier.  
I would hazard a guess and say that the unity costs significantly less to produce than 2 focboxes but we're charged nearly the same the price for it.  
Then it goes wrong as they always do.   I have to buy a new one.  
Focbox goes wrong I'm buying half the value of the unity.
I'm not a fan of the unity either as you may have surmised by now.  I would rather have had an upgraded drv version of the focbox.  Maybe with some integrated switching and antispark but still single drive.  
To summarise;
Do we want Lap tops or tower pc's?

Disclaimer. Receivers are the least problematic piece of any rc device in my opinion and experience but I would still like to be able to change it should I need to.

Different people different taste.

What is the point here? Getting crazy reading through it 😂 there are pluses and minuses in everything. I just don’t see a reason for diy people to be limited so much in your choice of remote. What if you more a trigger style remote guy or want don’t want telemetry on your remote? What if you have a cf enclosure and placing the receiver in an other position would solve connection issues? What if the build in receiver has signal problems when driving with others in a group? You can’t do anything in this case.

Also no uart port is pretty 🙄 so no external display etc.

and the rest of the topic has been me seemingly unsuccessfully trying to get across as you put it. Different people, different tastes. 

The suggestion from people that as it doesn't appeal to them it must be rubbish and trash and we should burn it in hell becomes tiring real quick. I try to work on the mentality of if you don't have anything constructive to say then say nothing at all. Not everyone shares this mentality.

So lets get this back to a constructive discussion about the Ownboard Dual VESC V6.6, so far apart from the spec sheet we have confirmed can not attach PPM/UART receiver. Looking at the circuit board it looks like it is only motors, sensors, power switch, battery & USB connections.

I once heard this story from an old guy.

His father was a textile dealer and when he was young he sent him to buy rolls of cloth from the importer with the following directions:

Buy 20 rolls of cloth that you like, 10 rolls that are indifferent to you and 5 rolls that are the most hideous you have ever seen.

When questioning his father why he should buy rolls of cloth that are ugly, his father responded that there is a buyer for everything.

Would be interesting if the power switch is reliable. If to look back Flipskys e- 
switch have been a massive flaw. 

I also don’t like that the phase wires so tiny and that you need a specific plug to connect them which included the sensor wires as well. So either you cut everything or you get this plug and solder all your motor wires to the the other plug.

I can’t find it on the pcb but the description says uart port as well.

It also says 300a peak current. Which seems for me unrealistic looking at that small and tiny motor plugs. 

I think it can be a good platform for the prebuilt market, but it’s nothing I would use for any diy projects.

If it works like ownboard's current ecs, and it's priced like ownboard esc and not like unity, I'm all for it. We can benefit from a spectrum of price and features. The ownboard esc is pretty awesome.

- potted and waterproof
- small
- cannot kill it
- if you still kill it, cheap as dirt
- no configuration to mess up
- great connectors for motor phase+sensors
- remote has great range and robust signal
- remote does not freak out when signal lost
- electronic switch works great
- remote is great form factor, and great throttle control range
- haptic in remote for things like pack overcharged (great for regen braking safety)

If they have a dual 6.6 at say $120 (less than a single focbox) with above features (well for vesc we need some configurability) it'll be awesome.

Sometimes I want change abs max to 150 and run 13s. Sometimes I want plug and play and not spend so much time and money. I'd love a $150ish dual esc with integrated everything that's tiny and bulletproof with a great remote, that can run 60 battery amps. 80 would be better, but if I could get the rest and sacrifice 20 amps, deal.

You can see this already happened with quadcopters. There used to be an ESC per motor, and a flight controller to control them. Now, it's all-in-one boards with flight controllers and 4 esc built in.

To be honest I'd love to see a 4wd eskate controller, and modular ESCs.

Maybe but lets not make assumptions and write off a product before facts are known. Most are trying to grab market share at the moment and making the most appealing product is how that is done.

Look at their W2 belt drive kit for example, the prototype had the pulley integrated into wheel. People said no, we want to be able to change wheels. The production board has a separate pulley so can change the wheels and they are about to release a Kegel core pulley so customers have more choice of wheels

Hi, are you 雷智? or many people use same account?  I’m TETSU I met 雷智 at HK. 

I have an advice for you. Don’t be offensive when you comment, but ask the reasons why other users write something about your stuffs. 

For example, about “built in receiver function in VESC”, your behavior was so so. You said about your sales points first, then asked why. To qsk why (or explain about function ) first is more better I felt. And don’t “push” your ideas or sales points first. I also heard “to save face is very important for Chinese people”, try to bird's-eye view. 

Some or most users hate Chinese copycats that don’t have the sence of patent (unless you did so or not) . Because “Infringement of rights” sometimes hinder the development of esk8 market. If you cannot understand this, you need to learn about why the patent system was invented. I know many Chinese  companies, so I guess it’s a little hard to understand for Chinese. ( But some people also know the Steve Job’s behavior about GUI at Xerox )

And be careful about what you comment. Your attitude will affect the brand images of EOVAN, Elofty and Ownboard. 

For reference :
Check Exway’s US customer support’s  behaviors (what he commented) on reddit. You’ll find good sample. They made fatal mistakes about firmware recently,  but will recover speedy maybe .  And you will also find Exway’s royal customers

I felt your communication style is like standard Chinese customer support, so you don’t need to change against Chinese customers (depends on your company’s strategy). But your style isn’t suitable for developed countries’ customers (especially for high amateurs or professionals in this forum) I guess. 

Check “COMMENTS” tab first

Receiver does not equal remote
[/quote]

it does mean that 99% of the time

even if the receiver supports different types of remotes its not gonna support every type of remote

@b264 

Damn dude, that's like borderline racist lmao... I have an ownboard that I modded out with new trucks, bushings, wheels, bearings, deck to the point where I was only using their battery, esc, and motors. Then I got a vesc and a motor to run a single belt drive. I only use their battery now. They don't advertise modularity but I did it anyway. If they have a vesc, then I could've spent the money that I spent on my vesc on a second motor. Not everybody thinks the way you do, just cause you can't change the receiver doesn't make it trash. 

Just because some things are integrated and you don't like that doesn't mean that nobody else will like it. I for one am really excited to see how ownboard can do with this new vesc and direct drive in the mid range pre built board market.

Cool off with the negativity.

um yes it does, its like saying swapping out the v1 meepo remote for the new hobbywing remote wont help

(btw the v1 remote is complete trash)

plus ownboard is not even alowed to advertise their esc as "vesc" as its trademarked, cough cough,:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

@AlanZhou well in that case, any vesc sold by TB (or literally anyone other than vedder) can't be advertised as a "vesc", but I don't see anyone complaining about that. With regards to that remote argument, the v1 remote is trash, but ownboard only use the hobbywing esc. there would be no reason to change the remote, it works and it works well. If these new boards with vesc and direct drive (whether it's mid range or high/mid range, it'll certainly be cheaper than any direct drive currently on the market) work well enough for the average consumer to not have to worry about having to send it in for repair, then it works well enough to not need insane configurability. anyone who wants a ton of configurability isn't buying an ownboard. people like me who enjoy tinkering but don't have time to build a board from the ground up would very much appreciate a product like this. 

again, not everyone wants the same thing from a product. just cause it's shitty for your purposes doesn't make it objectively shitty.

they arent advertised as vesc, please read, there's a reason they say, "based on vesc"

I mean if they say "based on vesc" then I bet ownboard will too. The elofty is one board, it's always nice to introduce more competition.

yes but your claim was it would be cheaper then any DD on the market

i am still looking forward of the dual 6.6 from own board though.

no idea about the tramp drama, soz. low cost = cut corners yeah but apparently they cut the right corners since I've yet to have any problem with my ownboard. and the elofty DD is not a complete board, overall it'd end up being either similarly priced or cheaper than the cost of building a complete board with elofty DD, don't you think? I'm excited to see how they do

are you using ownboard hubs? if you havent broke those then it means you dont ride hard.

have you tried the dual 6.6 yet and have you tested their dd?

just because a company has one good product dont mean the rest of their products are good

I am using their hubs, they're pretty great. I made mods to be able to use a single belt drive too when I want to. no I haven't tried the 6.6 or the DD. Why, have you?
