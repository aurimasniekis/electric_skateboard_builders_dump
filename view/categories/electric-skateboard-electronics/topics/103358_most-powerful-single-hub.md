Hi, I've been working on my boardup folding build. I want to change the setup to use a singe hub. Reason being I only have room for 1 vesc as space is insanely tight. Also the wheel diameter can't being anymore that 83mm. Sorry I'm having to be so specific because of space. Any suggestions or advice would be really appreciated. I'm running a 10s battery capable of about 60 amps continuous. Thanks jamie

The best 83mm hub motor is without question an @Hummie hub...ask him if there is a version with a single wheel drive
