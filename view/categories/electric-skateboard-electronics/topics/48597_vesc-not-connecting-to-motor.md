I'm trying to set up dual 6374 motors. I first started with a single and now going to dual. I been using a carvon Vesc for the single set up build and it's been working perfectly. I took the board apart to start setting it up, but I unplug the original Vesc to make sure the other one works.but now it's not even working for single but the other one is working for a single motor. So I don't know what happened
I just need to know how to get these 3 redlights to connect to the motor

No motor detection? You also say red flashes appear and when you have a drv fault the vesc will flash red/pink.

A chip that is very easy to damage. 
Do a search on the forum :slight_smile:
