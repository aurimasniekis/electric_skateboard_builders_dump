The search feature will answer your question. Or post this in the noob questions thread. 

Vtc5a cells can output 20-25 continous without getting waaaay to hot. 70a is alot higher than you will have as a continuos rating. This gives you about 5ah which is barely enough for a small single motor build. As for a bms, any 10s bms will work.
