I am going to go with 10s 4p. What types of configurations would be best for going twenty five Mph with around a 20 mile range?

The p stands for panda. 10s 6 pandas is better for 25 mph because pandas don't like to run faster than 5mph

That's how.

But for configuration you want, there's that 18650 cells 10 series, minimum about 4 in parallel, since those cells are around 3Ah capacity. For LiPo, you can find 5Ah cells, so 10 series and 2-3 in parallel.

Rest depends of all other things than batteries. Most notably on your weight.

P stands for parallel. 10s5p means 10 sets of cells, and each set has 5 cells in parallel. 50 in total. This is assuming you're going to be using 18650 size batteries. If you're going to use lipo cells like from hobbyking, then you don't need as many P, because each cell is larger.

Personally, I think 10s4p would get you 20 miles, with not much left over. 375-400 watt hours, depending on the cells.

If you're going to do a full DIY build, you should definitely read up on battery technolgy and configurations. You will be your own warranty (for the most part) so you should know how it works. Google is your best friend, also, the search function on this forum works pretty well too. Most of the basic questions you have are already answered.

Yea, actually watt hours are a good range indicator. I have (nominal) 360Wh, with range around 25-30km, and i weight 70kg.

Ampere-hours(Ah) times total voltage(10S is 36-37V) is Watt hours(Wh)

This is the 10S4P Samsung 30Q mod pack i build for Evolve IT will do what you want. You'll get about 20 miles out of it at anywhere from 22-25mph ish. 36v at 12ah means 436 watt hours. 

The only difference in wiring for this pack and a pack using a BMS from battery supports or elsewhere is the use of the balance negative lead.

No, there are many ways to build a battery pack of a given S-P number. That's just one of the simpler, easier to draw and build ones. 

Be very careful and do your research before you try to solder bare 18650 cells, if you're not careful/skillful, you can do damage to the cells that could result in thermal runaway, either while you're working on them or later while you're using the board. Look up tutorials, learn the principals, practice on junk/dead cells. Time yourself, try to get the time spent making a good solder joint as low as possible. 

This is serious, potentially deadly shit that we work with here. It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye, a hand, or a home, to a battery fire or explosion. Don't play with it unless you are willing to take full responsibility.

Yes this could be extremely dangerous like creating a bomb. You have to be very delicate and solder for as little time as possible to avoid thermal damage. Yes I can make sure to blow the fumes away. Yes I can do this on concrete. Yes I can and will have an electrical engineer to watch me do my work. Definitely where some gloves and safety glasses.

Hey bro don´t get offended by us, we´re always trying to help new peops.
But understand that every week new guys join in here and ask the same questions.

If you don´t know things like "what´s a Samsung 30Q?" it´s really hard to give you answers for further things..

Simple google things you don´t know, like the Samsung battery, and find additional answers here on the forum; just use the search bar and you´ll pretty much find anything you wanna know.
If you´re searching for longer than half an hour and really can´t find something, tell us and ask ;)

Sorry i left the stupid little humps out when the paths cross but don't connect. Also i did this in like 10 minutes to help somebody. And i hate rainbow fucking colors on my charts because i do actually like to look at them on occasion and that's not the place for me to show my affection for the LGBTQ community. 

Here's how it works:

1) find the main pack positive and count down at every positive side between there and the negative terminal. Those locations are where your balance leads go. 10 is at the positive, 1 is at the first positive past the main negative terminal. Correlate that to those numbers on your bms. Follow that up with a volt meter. PLug the negative probe of the volt meter into the negative side of the pack using either a gator clip or if you have a lead soldered you can just shove it into the end of the wire. Take the positive side and move down the balance connector you just spent all that time figuring out and you should see progressively lower voltages on each connector pin moving from positive to negative. 

2) something clever and terrible about your mom.

3) google samsung 30Q. I stated it was a samsung 30Q pack. Maybe, perhaps, on some distant logical planet, that means i used samsung 30Q cells. 

4) as a mod it has been my responsibility to not tear into people mercilessly on this forum. That is not my personal responsibility, nor is it aligned with my business plan really. I do it because i love the community.

I have chosen instead to promote hot glue and the use of the color red. 

Soldering doesn't need any promotion. In the DIY esk8 building community, soldering is as basic as tying your shoes. Learn how to solder on youtube, then come here when you need to put all the pieces together in the right order. However, We do answer questions all the time about what iron is the best, what solder do people like, flux in a bottle or flux in the wire or both, but how to actually solder is something personal and takes a lot of practice. I would be happy to offer all the tips i can if you want to start a thread about tips and tricks for soldering. Not actual solder tips, but instruction. You can buy your own iron tips.

if you use the Samsung 30Q cells you can go 4P and get the desired range. If you use a lower capacity cell, you may want to go 5P.

i have only said 4P. I even posted a 4P diagram and referenced the 4P packs i used in Evolve boards. I mentioned 5P just now because you did and had a question about which you should use. To answer your questions again, if you use the Sansung 30Q cells you only need 4P. So, to sum up, 

1) buy these cells: https://liionwholesale.com/collections/batteries/products/samsung-inr18650-30q-battery-15a-3000mah-flat-top-wholesale-discount-genuine-and-tested?variant=2915614724

2) wire them like i did in that diagram you had difficulty reading, or better yet, find a diagram for a 10S4P that you can easily read and follow that

3) have 20 miles of range.

longhairedboy  says 10s 5p @MysticalDork has said 10s 4p. We all say 10s p. Samsung Q cells or should I try using **18650** battery by panasonic?  .
[/quote]

Ignoring for a moment that you literally just said "18650 battery" from Panasonic, Tesla cells aren't ideal for our application because they're only good for about 10 amps. Samsung INR18650-30Q (that's the full name) cells are rated for 15 amps, and INR18650-25R cells are good for 20 amps.

Cells and Batteries are two completely different things.  A cell is a basic element of electric circuits and a battery is a circuit usually comprised of cells and possibly additional parts.

The thing you are talking about is a cell.

that sword board was an apollo. It came out great and i'm happy with the end result and i believe the customer is as well but it took me foreeeeevvvvvveeeeerrrrrr to build, and not just because of involving a third party and doing an interesting shape. We were both so interested in the thing that we were changing direction a lot out of excitement so there were like 50 hours into it by the time it was done. Usually my builds are about 20. You can imagine by the end of it all i hated the thing. I loved it, it was beautiful, but it made me suffer. Naturally it triggered a lot of the same feelings i had during my divorces. 

And now she's out there, and the gentleman is about to get his channel going. I'm both elated and terrified.

They might not have the same model number, but they're both 18650 which means that the process to spot weld is the same.

What are the B numbers? I can't read those numbers over the grey stuff. This doesn't say 18650 anywhere on it. Can i use this with LG cells? What about lipos? where do i plug in the charger? Does any current flow through that grey nickel stuff it doesn't say that it does. What does + and - mean?

This diagram is aweful. @whitepony can't draw and doesn't know anything about building anything obviously. I mean its not like he's an invaluable member of the community who has contributed a plethora of absolutely golden information over the years and has inspired me on a few occasions to do better.
