Hey guys,

I am looking to print my first 3D wheel pulley as i am currently interning at a company that allows me to use the printers. Question is: Whats the best kind of material I could be using that doesn't melt or break?

You could use ABS, ABS+, Nylon, PETG...but I have been using ABS for a long time with no issues.  Just dont use PLA.

Any of those would work? What about something fancy like

I have never seen that before, so I cannot say with any certainty.  I would assume the the structure would still share the same weaknesses that PLA has inherently, that its flexible and has a low melting temp.  Those are the reasons we don't use PLA for pulleys as the stress they under exploits those weaknesses and causes failure.

Ok thank you @mmaner.

I guess I will go with something like this

That should work right?

Also is the CAD file that i shared a good one, or you recommend a different one?

All of the @JuniorPotato93 models are great.  I have a modular version if you want be able to replace the pulley without removing the inserts.

I've tried some of those pla+metal. They are harder to print than abs and behave just like pla. They are only good for the looks. Of what I have tried I'd recommend petg

Do you recommend 1.75mm or 3mm diameter for the filament?

I’ve always used 1.75 for mine

That would depend on your printer, I believe the printer you linked above uses 1.75mm.

You can't choose between 1.75 or 3. You have to go with what your extruder takes

Yeah just saw:

_0,4mm nozzle (easily changeable) for 1,75 mm filament_

What makes this pulley "modular"?

You can change the gear out with having to remove the insert or retainer, which usually brakes them.  But much more important is that you can print different colors for each piece :).

Apart from the wheel and motor pulley, can i also print the motor mount?

I wouldn't suggest it.

Ok but the pulleys are reliable?

I don’t recommend you print the motor pulley either.  Definitely not the mount though

haha alright so basically the only thing that people are having success with is the wheel pulley?

You can print other stuff as well...volt meter covers, motor covers, all kinds of panel mounts, VESC cases, etc.  Just not many things that take a lot of stress, 3d printing is just not that good yet for low cost printing.

I ve seen pla printed mount, skateboard wheel, truck, and the deck. they worked for a while then break down. maybe u can print ABS and vapor champ. this sould hold fairly well for normal use. 

For better result, nylon would be great, it needs to be high temp print with heating bed. I think u can also cook it in oven for better bonding layer.

another thing is, those plastic will flex under stress, which is why motor mount made from brittle cf or 6000 or 7000 alu

U can also try ABS glass fiber reinforced like 40percent would be good enough, but not sure if there is such thing in filament

Yea pretty much.  Motor pulleys are a no go because motor heat can cause them to warp.  Get a steel motor pulley, it’s worth it
