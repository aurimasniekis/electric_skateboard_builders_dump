There's nothing on the forums, at least nothing that's states why you should or shouldn't increase or decrease and how much. But a lot of people are reporting amazing results, smoother rides and more torque after tweaking it.

Anyone care to explain?

Would like to know this as well. I know on some foc setups, doubling or halving it reduces cogging, but why?

was just looking all over vedder's forum and cant find much.  I believe it has to do with positioning and can both make things smoother and also more efficient.  Vedder says in a couple threads to try adjusting it so I think it's pretty safe to mess with.  I think it maybe determines at what angle commutation occurs.  
In the newer vesc I think it can more so self-determine things and less adjustment with it is necessary.

wondering what other things can be messed with and how they will effect efficiency and low speed control<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/7/a7e0cf1e0a53a006316e1ac332e227aa1802f944.JPG" width="690" height="230">
