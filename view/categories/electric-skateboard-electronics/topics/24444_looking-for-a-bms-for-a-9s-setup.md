Hello,
my setup: 
3 x ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 3S1P 30C (in series)
Turnigy SK3 6364 245kv
Vesc 4.12
And I want a BMS for my system, but find it really difficult to find one for a 9s setup.
Anyone knows a nice one for the setup?
Also I'll probably get this PSU: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Intelligent-Smart-37-8V-2A-Charger-for-9S-32-4V-33-3V-Li-ion-Li-Po-Battery-EU-/221896623314?hash=item33aa11c4d2:g:KtUAAOSwHjNWBgfK

Just get a 10s BMS and hook up 9 cells.

Have you tried this before? Just wondering if it can cause any other issue?

Is this a "thing"? I mean I have some 7S / 8S packs but I would want to avoid buying 4 BMS' and just buy two 8S if I could connect 7S packs to 8S BMS without issues. It won't screw with any BMS parameters? Thanks!

I haven't done it, but a lot of BMS's are BMS's that are built for higher cell counts for which they just remove some components for lower cell counts. The BMS measure's module voltage, so it should treat lower counts the same as long as you plug it in and solder correctly.

So there should be no problem in using a BMS for discharging as well?
Looking into going from 10s to 8s since I don't want to replace all cells. I have two fresh ones installed but they drain much faster than the ones that are 'worked in'.

Sorry for reopening topic but I got this BMS and trying to make a board for dad. Question is I'm using BMS for charging only, the BMS doesn't have a C- so where would I connect this wire for this at ? Please any answer will help, I just want my dad to be riding and enjoying the esk8
