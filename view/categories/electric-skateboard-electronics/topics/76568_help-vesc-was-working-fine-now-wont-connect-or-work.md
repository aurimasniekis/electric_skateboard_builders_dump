So I recently made my new board and everything was working fine, I set my vesc settings in vesc tool, set one and slave and the other as master and connected them and set the appropriate settings: motor max: 60 amps min -40 Bat max: 30 min: -20, the battery cutoff, set the max erpm to 60000 and -60000, took it for a ride and everything was working perfectly, got home unplugged the loop key and came back to it 5 mins later plugged loop key back in and remote wouldn't connected so I opened the board and plugged in the vesc and now it isn't connecting to the computer, either of them! I tried using different cables unplugging and plugging back in but I wont connect to the pc, please help.

My boards specs:
dual flipsky vesc 4.12
dual sk3 6364 190kvs
5ah Turnigy 25c lipo

Well that means the VESC still turns on. Do you have a 4.20 dual or 2 singles?

if you switch it off, disconnect canbus and just power one vesc up with the receiver, does it then work?
```

the power cables are wired together so I cant only power one but I disconnected them from canbus and tried one but it still wont connect, and I cant check terminal for faults because they wont connect.

Could be that either you USB cable is broken. Or the USB port is broken. Try wiggle the USB port to see if you get connection at some angle.

@Winfly @mynamesmatt now when I try to connect it, it says nor firmware read version even though it had firmware when I edited settings before. How can firmware just disappear?

It's a long-shot, but try this:
Assuming you are using a Windows machine, disconnect the USB to your VESC, open the Device Manager and expand the Ports sub-menu. Note what current COM port is listed (if any). Now connect your VESC and observe if a new COM port is added in the Device Manager. If a new port is added, right-click on that port and select "Uninstall device" and also select "Delete the driver software". Go to the top menu of the Device Manager and click Action, "Scan for hardware changes". Your VESC's COM port should be re-detected and added to the Ports sub-menu. Right click on the newly added COM port (it may have a yellow exclamation next to it), then select Update Driver, "Search automatically for updated driver software". Once the driver has been updated for your VESC's COM port and status looks normal, go into the VESC tool, select the COM port that matches what you saw in Device Manager, then connect. Post the latest output that you get from VESC terminal.
```

Also try turning your pc off, connecting the usb and starting it up while connected. I had a 6.6 that would only read doing that.
