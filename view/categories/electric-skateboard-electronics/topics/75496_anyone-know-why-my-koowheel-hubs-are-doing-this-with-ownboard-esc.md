1st vid(motor sound)

2nd vid(motor sound)

3rd vid(esc sound)
https://youtu.be/Zk1fpOar39Y

he sensors seem to work great now that I've soldered them correctly (I'll use electrical tape don't worry)

But even sensorless the hubs keep making that sound.... Shakes the whole table and makes me think that maaaaybe I should get new hubs....

Any help is appreciated üôÇ

E: excuse my mess, Im back for break and don't really have a room üòÇ

What dafuc is that loud noise? Is it delayed like that where you pull throttle and then it makes that sound?

The white wire coming from the hub motors, what is that? It‚Äôs not solder. I wonder why? Did the koowheel ESC use 9 pin connector?

Here's another video, I'll add it to the main body though.

I'm not sure actually, but the white is temperature (according to the carvon TD thread, as koowheel provides their motor)

To me it seems like the motors momentarily get stalled. Are both doing this? I cant tell from the vid

When my motors are plugged in with everything on, the esc actually makes a noise ...

When I'm done speaking in the video, turn the volume up. It sounds like high pitch tv static

If its a single (dual) ESC driving them, then I guess it can *somehow* make sense that both get stalled at once... but what activates the stalling? did you touch the brake? or was this just on constant power spinining the motors?

It's when I reach a certain point in the throttle/power curve

No break or anything like that.

Maybe it's just because it's unloaded???? I haven't ridden them yet but if they act like this I'm kinda scared to :thinking:

the plot thickens.

dude i have no clue wtf is going on here. And the motors still continue spining after the stall.. Im affraid that your ESC might be somehow busted.

Perhaps some magic pixie masters can chime in

If that's the case ownboard sold me a faulty esc üòÇüòÇ I've babied this thing for that exact reason. Bummer.

When I get back to school I can check if they work on focboxes

@skateborad

Have you ever experienced this with your esc? I know it's "different" ;) but.... X)

They spin fine at first, so motors cant be at fault.

Maybe some wrong settings with the sensors, where they crap out at some speed? but again, spins fine until that point, doesnt make sense

Then my last guess is that the erpm exceeds the limits of the esc... :D again, how can someone sell such incompatible gear then.. Im leaning towards a faulty esc. Contact the seller, see if they can do something maybe

Sounds like a gun shot 

Next thing you could try are different hubs but you soldered the sensor wires...

Are those koowheel hubs?

Yep! Traded a 4.12 vesc for them üòÇüòÇ


Also part of the sound youre hearing is it hitting my table. It literally bucks.
I also have no other hubs or escs to test this on üßêüò£

Sorry about your ESC

I have a slightly used less than 25 miles koolwheel esc that comes w/remote that I took off carvon Exo. It comes with 9 pin connector so it may not work with your current hubs with bullet connectors. I have enclosure for the esc and 10s3p battery w/battery. Let me know if you are interested.

Thanks, but unfortunately I'm gonna pass, as my battery was from @hyperIon1 and doesn't come with their(koowheel) bms(they have the same catch as evolve, right? Bms helps control everything else)

All good. Just throwing that out there.

I‚Äôm not totally sure koolwheel makes BMS. They for sure make your electrical speed control for dual motors. I believe you can use any battery to power koolwheel ESC.

I tried using sime 97mm koowheel hubs with an ownboard esc and had the same issue. I think they just are not  compatable?   I ended up switching from a 9 pin to bullet connectors and using a diyeboard dual esc and it works fine...

Koolwheel does not work with skull board hub motors but works with carvon TD drives. It seems companies that make ESC only work with companies hubs or modified company hubs

(Maybe you know :) )
Do koowheel escs need bms?

I read that each ESC is programmed to specific motor (motor detection) this means that any other motor will simply not work. So you could get either koowheel ESC or vesc

If it‚Äôs a esc you can‚Äôt set limits on, that would be the reason. Most are bldc controllers and are set to OEM equipment. Specific for that controller. 
It would create a problem from both ends. Battery to high in volts/amps and motor not rated for bldc controller

I had the same problem maybe 6 months ago  Koolwheel hub motor and wowgo esc.  Nothing could be done.  I ended up abandoning the set up.  I contacted wowgo and they dont even know why it does not work.

Speed controllers need to understand specifics of the motors. No two brands of motors are the same. Winding resistance, flux link, and a few other numbers change from motor to motor. These numbers are important for the esc to function properly.

The ESC always makes this buzzing sound. I think the ESC is fine. The Ownboard hubs and the Koowheel hubs have different KV's your hubs spin way faster on half throttle then mine which are the proprietary ones, I am guessing you are hitting the erpm limits of the ESC.

Get you a dual or two single vesc of some sorts and you should be fine. I had them hooked up to a focbox for testing. Tested both sides individually and had no problems. Your esc is limiting the hubs.

I tagged you in hopes that you've seen this issue with your esc + hubs before, and if you know any way to remedy it. I understand it's an ownbaord esc, but I hope it's similar enough for you to help(please :D) :slight_smile:

Each ESC is programmed to specific hub motor (motor detection). Do you use Koowheel hub motors? That might be the reason. How about using Wowgo ESC+Remote+motors to have a try? üòÇ
