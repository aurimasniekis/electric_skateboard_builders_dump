_Overworking or overcharging a lithium-ion battery can cause deformation in its spiral-shaped electrode._

> From the fiery Note 7 debacles to exploding hoverboards, lithium-ion batteries aren't doing so hot lately. A new study helps to explain how these popular power sources can turn into safety hazards.

> In the paper, published in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society, scientists at the Canadian Light Source (CLS) synchrotron looked inside an overworked battery. In this case, they drained a battery until its voltage was below a critical level.

> _Overcharging or overworking deforms the insides of a battery. (A) shows the inside of a battery before it was misused. (B) shows how misuse causes the original design defects to become even more warped. (C) highlights the areas where warping got worse._

> When we overcharge or overheat lithium ion batteries, the materials inside start to break down and produce bubbles of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Pressure builds up, and the hot battery swells from a rectangle into a pillow shape. Sometimes the phone involved will operate afterwards. Other times it will die. And occasionally—kapow!

> To see what's happening inside the battery when it swells, the CLS team used an x-ray technique called computed tomography.

> Inside the battery is an electrode that spirals out from a central point like a jellyroll. The x-ray scan revealed that the bubbles produced during overheating warped and dented this electrode.

> Intriguingly, the study authors found that the worst deformation from the gas buildup occurred in areas that had slight defects before the battery was ever over-drained. The authors note that doing more studies like this, on a larger variety of batteries, would improve understanding of how these batteries respond to gas evolution, which could lead to better designs.

Unrelated to skateboards, but I read that that some users of the new Macbook Pros are reporting "bubbling" batteries.  Which sounds like exactly what this article is describing

Nice post!

Its all about the thermo chemical limits of these material! they are designed to be highly reactive to achieve high energy density and power output. Pushing past these limits causes breakdown which can range from reduced performance to the more interesting thermal runaway (:boom:) that boosted is dealing with now.
