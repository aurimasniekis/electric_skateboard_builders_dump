Im trying to figure out how to keep my lipo batterys inside my enclosure and just have a deans plug and balance plug (both female) for an easy plug and charge solutiom. Only one problem.... i cant figure out how to keep the anti spark switch plugged in while i have another outlet that charges the lipo.... any ideas?

I already built my own little charging box to make dealing with lipos way easier, i recommend building a box for your lipo charger just to make things nice and tidy lol but you dont really need it. It just makes transporting your charger way easier.  Oh and i have a cover with the cutouts of just the screen and buttons i just dont have a picture of it. And i got this enclosure on ebay if anyone wants to know!
