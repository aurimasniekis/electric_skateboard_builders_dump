I got some of the 10 gauge silicon on hobbyking, which solder should I get for this, for joining XT60 connectors, and XT90 connectors?

Normal lead solder will do

Personal preference is to avoid lead-free. I just can't stand to work with it. Besides that, I usually go with 60/40

That stuff will definitely work, although unless you're planning on doing a ton of soldering, you probably don't need as much as @smurf got.

Also the flux in solder has a 4 year shelf life so only get as much as you need and if you find a really great deal it's probably expired or about to.
