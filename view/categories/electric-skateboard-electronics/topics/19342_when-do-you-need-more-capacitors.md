What do capacitors do and how do you know if you need more of them?
I found this site got me thinking about it

Your ESC should have capacitors on it, the VESC has 2-3 depending on where you get it.  Capacitors act like high discharge batteries, meaning the discharge as quickly as they are charged.  Like the post said it can be used to handle ripples in the voltage input.  I don't think you need to worry about how many capacitors you have on an ESK8.

For normal operation the capacitance installed on the VESC and on other ESCs is enough.

Those extra cap pcbs make sense if you are pulling very high power at medium duty cycles of if your battery cables are longer than 50cm.

Benjamin Vedder gives very detailed information on this topic in the second half of this video:
