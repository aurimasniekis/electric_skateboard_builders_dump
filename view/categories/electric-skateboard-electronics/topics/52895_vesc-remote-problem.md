Hello,

@Ferret99

You need to adjust your pulse width again. 
It's due to value differences

If you need help I will adjust it using Team viewer (if you want to)

Have you tried changing the channel on the receiver and do the adjustments again
(If possible, let me check it using team viewer)

Continuing the discussion from [Vesc remote problem](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-remote-problem/52895/5):

I have the same remote and can't get them to bind. How did you do it?

You plugged in the right channel on the receiver?
The plug is in the right polarity on the vesc and on the receiver?

```
how many channels do you have on the receiver? Did you try binding with each one of them to see if any works?
