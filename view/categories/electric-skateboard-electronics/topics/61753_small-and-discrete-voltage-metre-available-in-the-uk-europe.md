As the title says!

Looking for a voltage display that is smaller than this one https://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-Battery-Capacity-Monitor-Voltmeter/dp/B07BT2TBTS.

Struggling to find vendors!

Check the thread https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trusted-sellers-and-builders-these-people-will-not-rip-you-off-discussion-thread/48511?u=rey8801. You will find a lot of vendors. I also sell almost the same you show there and I like it because you can program it (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/esk8-flea-market-eu-ww-small-cheap-parts-hm-10-bluetooth-android-oreo-compatible-volt-meter-3dprinting/57463?u=rey8801). I personally do not like too small volt meter becasue then they usually show only the battery percentage which I find it not precise. I prefer to see the Volt too.

Appreciate it! 

The problem i have with that specific voltage metre is that it is too big to fit on the side of my enclosure.

And what about place it below the enclosure? Try to see if this one would fit https://electricboardsolutions.com/products/battery-level-indicator
Frederic the vendor in case of questions @e.board_solutions :wink:

Although it is just a volt meter, doesn't show in percentage

Better Volt than percentage to me. But he said UK/EU that's why the European shops
And it's only 30V. I have found similar on ebay.uk up to 60V. I need to check

this one's up to 30v so wouldn't work for anything above a 6s

i've used this one, it's nice and small, readings are adjustable but need to supply an additional 5-12v, a bit of a hassle:

using this one now, only needs + and - which is nice but a bit bulkier:

I'm being lazy and cheap by just using an Ownboard ESC. 

Got a VESC on order for an Ebike project though!
