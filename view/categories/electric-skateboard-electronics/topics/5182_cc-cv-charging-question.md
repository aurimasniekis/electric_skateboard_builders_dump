I want to build a custom 10S5P battery pack for my build. I want to use the following parts:

**50 LG HG2 Cells**

**BMS:**

**AAANNNDDDD either one of these power supplies:**

I am trying to achieve **Constant Current Constant Voltage** charging to safely charge each cell to max capacity whilst charging the pack quickly as possible.

Is the BMS responsible for providing the trickle charge of 50-100mA to charge each cell to its full capacity once the cell voltage reaches 4.2V (i.e. by only drawing 50-100mA from the power supply) 
OR 
Should the power supply itself be responsible for the trickle current/Constant Voltage charging?


**BMS Specs say this:**
Technical Parameters:
Balanced current: 60mA (VCELL = 4.20V when)
Balanced for: 4.20 Â± 0.05 V
```

That top power supply outputs 48v. That is too much for 10S. @whitepony may be able to answer your other questions.

Yep but it can adjusted within the voltage ranges of 41-56V it says on the spec sheet so I thought it would be ok.

the power supply is doing the cc/cv switching, a bms just checks if each parallel pack is within 2.5-4.2V (or whatever the bms specs are). im charging since 1.5years with a "link 2" kind of charger, set to 41.4V cv saturation with 4A cc current!

Ahhh right I see. So I should then go in for the 2A charger you think?

I am also building a battery pack 10s3p with HG2 batteries. What charger did you buy? And what BMS did you buy?
