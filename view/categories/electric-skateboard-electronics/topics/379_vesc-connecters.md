Does anyone know what cable connectors are used on the VESC and could I get a wiring diagram to connect batteries, switch, VESC, receiver and motor for an electric skateboard please.

The motor connectors are 5.5 mm bullet connectors, and the battery connector is an xt60 connector.

@kruizy I posted a diagram: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/please-look-at-my-diagram/445. 
Disclaimer: I haven't built mine yet but this is what I came up with after lots of reading in this forum.
