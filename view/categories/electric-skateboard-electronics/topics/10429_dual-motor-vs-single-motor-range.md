How much less range will I get with a dual setup in compair to a single setup at same speed? I know the motors only have a certain efficiency. Do I need to multiply those losses x2? Has anyone experience with that?

```
You will have around 30% loss. 
Base on real wold use

One motor versus two.
One motor will have to work twice as hard as two motors to obtain the same speed.
So, you can have one motor pulling 30 amps
Or, you can have  two motors pulling 15 amps each
Range is determined by how much current your pulling from the battery.
on flat ground, your range will be much better than if your climbing hills.
And much better if your cruising than if your racing around or doing a lot of stop and go.
One motor or two, in theory your range should be the same.
performance however, acceleration and braking is much better with two motors.
And much less strain on the motor and Esc or Vesc when there are two to share the load.
One motor is ok if your on a tight budget.
But if you got the money to burn, dual motor is the way to go.

Most of the power loss comes from double the belts I reckon.  But i think once you have two motors you'll want to go faster. You'll get more comfortable because you have double the acceleration power and more importantly double the brakes. So it's hard not to accelerate quicker and stay at higher speed longer knowing you can stop quickly and doing so you will lose range from my personal experience.

I agree with this. I'm pretty sure my battery life would be worse with a single motor given how much it'll struggle on SF hills

i had single on my first eboard. 
Doulble is much better and I still get good range.

I love a dual set up 
for aesthetic looks cooler 
for performance better torque with less stress. 
And for the braking power,this is my main reason. City streets riding needs good brakes.

I'd say dual is a requirement living anywhere with bigger hills. Going down a big hill on a single motor will eventually be disastrous when the belt breaks.

if the single motor is big enough could be more efficient and get more range.   I barely noticed the handling difference between one and two and only notice one motor isn't going because of less power.   I'd rather ride one motor that has twice the power.  Only needing one esc and less complications is appealing as well as the efficiency. Handling is so similar 
I guess more is safer though.

Opposite for me. My wheels lift sometimes and i lose traction, so i need a motor on each side.

Doesn't the vesc traction control stop that?  Does for me. Actually that is a nice feature of two and the traction control is a nice feature. U reminded me @evoheyax ur board had spinning wheels when they left the ground last night when I tried it.

traction control isn't the issue I'm talking about though. if you lose traction with 1 motor, you won't be accelerating.

Yea. I never rode a single long enough to experience losing power as it left the ground.  I'd like to try it with the traction control and a single.

I have a single motor and the wheel spends a lot when turning probly because my trucks are so tight 
If you get 2 motors you can dobble your motor gear size and go way faster but you probably need batterys with more c rating

traction control wouldn't do anything on a single, it's a multi VESC feature.

@Quinlanbrown Speed is not as important as responsiveness and torque. You can have low reduction, but you'll need going dangerously fast and will be a ton of stress on all your components.

DOn't listen to KALY, total non sense, you will get better range with 2 motors If you will be using the same output. You want people to tell you facts, not what they think might be true...  1 motor will have to work way more than twice as hard... Loses because of heat, loses because of the motor pushing your board to the side instead of going straight. Not mentioning that when a belt brakes with one motor, you are freewheeling and pray you stop before you hit a decline and won't be able to stop at all.

Wow. A two year bump? Smh.

Might as well throw out my two cents while I'm here though.

I have been using my single motor board (12S 12000mah, 97mm wheels, TB(I forget the size)230 motor)
For quite a while.
Generally I was able to get up to 29mph on one motor, with a range of about 20~miles. Acceleration felt a bit weak and I would and needed to give just the slightest kick from a standstill. (Sensorless)
Breaking from 20mph to 3-5mph took about 6 seconds (which is quite a bit for road use) and at the end of the breaking period the break would feel pretty weak. So much so that I would usually footbreak.

Recently I added another 230kv motor and VESC, and WOW. It makes a HUGE diffrence.

My top speed shot from 29mph, to somewhere probably in the 38-40s (I have yet to dare to try it thx to weak stock brushings I need to change out :I)
My range went down about 3-4 miles.
I no longer need to kick on acceleration (Sensorless)
My acceleration makes my smile every time. I can beat any car from a dead stop at a stop light, and make it across the road before they catch up. (It also sounds strong, and no longer like a whiny motor is going to kill itself lol)
Controlled breaking from 25mph takes about 4 seconds, and feels strong, firm, and stable. 


My motors are noticeably less hot (if even warm) after a run vs when I was running a single motor. This probably goes for the dual VESCs too.
I pull less amps per motor when accelerating. And can put down more breaking power whenever needed.
The chance of my belts snapping and/or teeth slipping are REALLY REALLY low because they share the strain of all forces asked of them.
Did I mention better breaking?

My confidence in boarding on roads aside cars has shot WAY up, and I am actually able to feel safer during the rides, which makes the whole experience much more enjoyable.

After tasting what dual motors feels like, I will never, EVER, EVERRR go back to single motor :wink:

Of course with confidence comes higher and more dangerous speeds.
I do wear full head protection, along with motorcycle armor for my chest, back, and arms, as well as knee/shin pads. I also always wear jeans, and usually some sort of longsleeve (I prefer hoodies) 
I have taken a spill at 35~mph, and only came out with 3 little skinned spots on one inner elbow(I have no idea how they got there. My longsleeve jacket was completely intact), and sore outer thigh and ego. No blood at all.

What? Lol. Am I missing something? Everything Kaly said was spot on, at least according to my tested FACTS :p 

1 motor MAY have to a little more then twice as hard, but you also won't be going as fast as you would be with two motors anyway. Your range WILL be better with one motor vs 2 (Unless most of your travel time is on hilly terrain. In which case the single motor may no longer have an advantage due to working even harder) 

But it's certainly not because
[quote="Pantata, post:17, topic:10429"]
loses because of the motor pushing your board to the side instead of going straight.
[/quote]
I don't know how people can continue to believe this fallacy :laughing: Not here to argue, but @Pantata Sir, your fact there is wrong. EXTREMELY negligible at best.

Yes, the idea of the motor turning one wheel more then the unpowered wheel, and causing the board to turn towards the un-powered side is a safe assumption. But keep in mind:
1. Boards have FOUR wheels. Not two. All wheels point straight ahead. Both the powered wheel, and the unpowered wheel. There is no turning.

2. Boards operate under the pressure of being stood upon. This increases the traction of ALL four wheels on the ground. Meaning unless you accelerate FAST (which is hard to do on one motor anyway) and spin the motor wheel in a burn out, generally ALL four wheels will rotate at the same speed as you ride.
Do the front wheels of a rear-wheel-drive car spin faster then the powered back wheels? No. Normally they do not.

3. The road, pavement, sidewalk, grass, gravel, dirt, riding surface is not perfectly level or flat anyway and would cause your board to drift.

Wouldn't this get you MORE range with a single motor? Considering you are still moving, and don't need to use the motor/belt :stuck_out_tongue: ESPECIALLY when you get to that decline! 


All-in-all
Better range on 2 motors vs 1? No, unless you have a bunch of steep hills everywhere.
But while it may be less range, it certainly is NOT half the range. :+1:

Man I kinda don't wanna waste my time here, I don't mean "waste" but you are talking total non sense, If you wanna bet we can. Everything I said is correct. With one motor, your back wheels are not riding in sync with your front wheels, your back truck keeps bending to the side giving you 4 tracks instead of 2, 2 motors sharing the load of one will be more efficient and you will get more range with two motors.  YOu keep giving really bad arguments, it looks more like you don't like me being correct...  What does broken belt have to do with range? Boards have 4 wheels and see what your board does when you try to accelerate with one motor... Lol, man I don't even know why I am atlking to you... I gave you clear facts, this is how it is is you don't believe me go study electricity/physics, ask an expert maybe... Before you go on a rant telling us stories you came up with in your head... No offense but you haven't made a single meaningful argument and it is obvious you have no knowledge in this... Stating that two motors will eat more battery cause you will be using more power... No DA Colombo, that's the point... That work needs to be shared... If you just add another motor using way more power from the batter, then of course it will last less... Seriously... Are you serious?

"All-in-all

There are big losses in heat and big losses in transfer of energy to the board when you are using one motor on one wheel on one side... This is me done, educate yourself from what I said and next time don't tell us what you think, tell us what you know and can back up... Cause people like you are the reason why so  many make so many stupid mistakes... 99 percent of you are saying stuff you have no clue about, but people read it and believe it... I can see someone byuing a 1wd because of you telling him this BS... Shame on you, too cocky to shut up and listen... No, you got to be the smart one telling total BS...

The broken belt has nothing to do with actual increase in range. I was making a joke :smile:

Ok, so your last replies were a bit confusing to me, but I take it you are standing with your view that
"Two motors will give you better RANGE then one motor"
Correct?

My view is 
"One motor will give you better range then two motors"
Correct?


This is not a waste of time by any means! I hope this is constructive disagreement.

You are right. I do not know EXACT numbers, as I have not gone and fully run my battery out completely with either a single or dual motor set up. I just note the millage (with a speedometer app I have on my phone) and the percentage of battery used. And with those simple calculations I would say I lost about 30% of my range with dual motors.


I offer a proposition. In interest of finding out the answer, by fact, a real world experiment. 

I live in a valley in California. There is quite a bit of long flat non-highway roads around.

I will fully charge my battery, and ride it at a constant speed of 25mph with dual motors until it shuts off. I will measure that distance both with Google Maps, as well as my phone speedometer.

I will recharge that same batter, disconnect one motor, and ride the SAME road starting at the SAME place, and will ride at 25mph with the single motor until the battery shuts off. I will measure that distance both with Google Maps, as well as my phone speedometer.

All of this on video.

And I will come back with the honest results :slight_smile:

Sound good mate?

I found thereâ€™s not much diffrance in range.
1 motor I lost KWh in heat motor got noticeably warmer and the fact the back trucks are tork steering so you constantly steer a little to correct this resulting in a little more drag on the back wheels. 

2 motors l lost KWh on belt resistance but mainly in accelerating harder (this is not a fair comparison as my dule set up could pull more amps)

On flats generally cruising around 1 motor gets better range

Tearing off and going up hills 2 motors got better range. The more you build confidence the harder you acelarate witch then reduces your range.

I stayed with 2 motors because of brakes! 1 motor I was always feathering brakes worried about skidding braking down hills.

I also have my back trucks stiffer so on verry tight turns I would louse traction if the powered wheel was on the out side 

If your looking for more range then play with the VESC settings cap the motor power restricted the acceleration curve and delays and you get better range (Iâ€™m sure some one hear with more exsperiance can sergers other settings and gear ratios to also improve range) or use more cells in the battery more s or more p 

Iv got a feeling people who say 1 motor has Mutch better range because there comparing a single 6570 motor with 80a vs dule 6555 combined a 130a (approx figers all motors are difrent)

cost is the only real reason to go single norhing wrong with that. just comes down to whatâ€™s more important to you in your build. The hole point of DIY is to build and customise what best suits what you want and not compromise on what a prebuilt board gives you. 

Rember all advise is opinions you eather take it or dismiss it. Not every ones right all the time you just have to pick the bits you agree with and there is always a exception to the rules 1 component might work better with a difrent one on certain settings one Persian set up might work better on a single motor than most dule set ups and vise verser.
