Hey I am Planning out my build and I was wondering if I could use these 12 volt batteries and put 3 of them in series. If you have any other cheap battery ideas I am open to suggestion. My budget for the batteries is around $80 - $100

other cheap battery ideas
[/quote]

there isn´t something like this. batteries are not cheap. if they are than it´s very likely that it´s fake cells or cells which not work for us. don´t cheap out on the battery. best thing which can happen, you pay twice, worst thing you what can happen, you burn something down.

These batteries are good, https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-LG-36V-4-4AH-BATTERY-PACK-18650-EBIKE-VAPE-POWERWALL-BATTERIES-20-CELLS-BMS/183770560027?hash=item2ac994361b:g:nKUAAOSwuspY9YNZ:sc:FedExHomeDelivery!10801!US!-1

Many people have used them and they work really well, I personally have 4 of these suckers. They used to be around 35$ but people kept buying them so now they're wayy more expensive

So this battery doesn't have a bms attached and the battery already has the wires attached so could I just plug the wires strait into the bms or is there a certain way I have to solder it

Um why would you get one without a bms when you can just get one WITH a bms?
And to plug in the bms you need to make sure the connectors are the same type and also solder the the battery negative to the B- on the BMS

As others have said, those are very likely fake cells. The cheaper they are, the worse they will perform 99% of the time. Some people use genuine dirt cheap ebay cells, but they are the lower grade cells making it into those packs. Real "A" grade cells are worth the extra cost. Dont buy a cheap pack or you will regret it. Wether it is the lifespan, discharge ability, or something else. The cheap cells are not worth buying

If you really want good performance on a budget, get lipos. They typically have 1/3 the lifespan of an 18650 but have great discharge abilities

40a max current is gonna be pretty awful for hard acceleration with a single motor. You want 60 or so for a single motor build

This is the golden advice you've been looking for.  If you can't afford a decent battery, then you can certainly afford a very, very nice *unpowered* longboard which will perform very well.  Under gravity or kick-pushing power.

Do y'all [see this](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/fresh-video-from-crunchie-bathurst/90686?u=b264)?

I don't understand the hate around these batteries. Many people have used these and they work great for people on a budget, heck all they're basically the same as the ones chinese boards have in them. If you don't like the range then just get 2 of these packs and connect them in parallel. 

There are BUDGET boards that work and work well and then there are NON BUDGET boards that perform like a beast. This thread is about BUDGET boards and parts that work well within a budget. If something works well and its cheap but not as good as their expensive brothers that work better, they still fuckin work and kick ass ON A BUDGET

And @mtuan293 Yes these are LG MF1 cells

Lol you gotta get used to the mentality of most people on this forum. If you ain’t spending thousands for a build then prepare for the hate.   
/s

Don’t get me wrong, you get what you paid for. But not many people willing to spend thousands when they first got into esk8 building. Me personally just need a board to ride around campus, so I don’t see the need for super high performance build with lots of expensive part.

Lol I don't think the /s is necessary, this is true, I've been on the forums for almost 2 years now, and before it was all nice and well and people actually wanted to make things work and budget was still a thing and everyone wanted to make something that worked without breaking the bank. Nowadays people get mad if you cheap out on some parts or get a good deal on stuff, everything has to be perfect. Many people on this forum don't understand that some people don't want to drop 1.5k+ on their first board.

They also don't understand that sometimes cheap =/= bad there are parts out there that are good AND cheap

I think Flipsky is the perfect example for this. Their dual 4.20 is probably the cheapest you can get for a dual build. However human makes mistakes, and their design has a flaw causing cutouts, thus getting hate on that. Luckily we have some talented people who spent time to find the flaw and fixed it. 

[quote="Gamer43, post:57, topic:87824, full:true"]
I guess we can say that after the resistor change, the FSESC 4.20 is probably one of the best VESC4 hardware variants available, especially at its price point, heatsink, and form factor.

12S FOC 60A, full throttle no problems. Hard to beat.

The budget is not necessary a problem...

I read that the budget for batteries is 100 dollars.  we used to buy lipos for that price.  I would not trust such cheap packs in my house myself. 

I believe some people just want to warn him to spend more.  if he starts to like esk8’ing (which I do expect).  I am almost certain that in 2 months he will complain about the capacity or sag of his battery. 

Also I see that @speedystage772 has is account only for one day. I can only suggest to check out some extra wiki’s and build topic before asking questions.  Then he don’t need to ask easy questions about “so could I plug those wires directly into that BMS”

I know the step inside this hobby can be difficult if you don’t have much experience with electronics and soldering etc. It is a steep learning curve. The most of the work is actually reading and retraining your self.  once you are well done with this, building the board is easy. 

And btw: cheap boards are no problem on this forum. Many users are running a board off 500-600 euro. I know cheap is for some other guys 200 euro. But for that price it is very difficult to build a board. 

If you do research I am for 100% sure you can nowadays build a good first board for around 400 euro’s. If I see the amount off parts you can now buy and the cheap price off some part. I know 2 years back almost everything was much more expensive

Yeah I get we used to buy lipos for that price, but time has proven that these batteries work, did you see the thread that has 200+ replies and a lot of happy forum members saying that these batteries are good. I'm just trying to say that these things work, they're cheap, and it has proven itself to be reliable.

And if he really does complain about the sag and capacity of his battery in 2 months that's his issue, he can resolve it if he spends more money but for the price I think this is the best solution. I still complain everyday about not getting  enough torque from my board and I run a dual 6374 on 75 bat/ 120 motor per motor. 

I know me and you wouldn't buy these packs personally since we have better solutions and a bigger budget but to a beginner this is good enough. There's nothing out there that can beat these things in consideration to wh, amps, weight, simplicity, to dollar ratio. 

And yes I completely agree that @speedystage772 needs to read a whole lot more on this forum before assembling his first board

Isnt it because the "high" discharge rating so people tend to use it with high discharge? I think lithium batteries are similar in some way. The higher in current you charge/discharge, the faster **dendrites** will grow. So my guess is if you use Lipo with a bit more gentle current, then it *could possibly* last longer.

hey guys just letting you know that the board is basically done with the charge port connector on the way. Due to slow shipping the board has taken months. However, I was able to build the board for 270 AUD which is 186 US dollars which considering it has an 8.8 ah battery and dual drive is a great price. Thanks for all your help in the process

Just going to bump this thread with this
https://ride1up.com/product/samsung-eskate-battery-3p10s-25r-7-5ah/
Really nice battery for a budget build, only a 35A Cont. BMS but that is enough for 1 motor with the higher burst amps it can do.
