Hi everyone 
I‚Äôm building flat pack double liner and i‚Äôm wondering about the nickel strips 
I use 0.20mm 8 it is going to be 12s7p of vt6 
I will set up battery max for each vesc at 50A total 100A 
The nickel strips I use they can do for the best 6.4A this means I have to do 15 liner sounds crazy 
Can you help me thank you

```
firstly connect the cells in paralel with one layer
than connect each of the cells in paralel to another paralel group with one layer
then when you are making the outside connections double or triple the nickel
and yes a better sketch would be helpfull

he said 100amps, those series connections need to be serious...

My battery max for each vesc will be at 50A 
But I don‚Äôt think I will it 100A 
Bc most when a electric skateboard it some big A is when we start and after we are around 5A

Hmm I'm doing something similar, mine is gona be 12s8p but I'm buying enough cells to make a 10p pack because if it fits I'm gona make a 10p for my 4wd build.

dunno this over my paygrade, i know that you never going to draw 100amps anywhere near continous but who knows what you drive how you drive. Most people at least double their series connections on the pack.

I'd add more layers to the series or solder copper braids between the poles.

If i double where you see the blue on the picture is ok 
It will be like 4 nickel strips 2 on each side

the series connection yes.
@barajabali can you look at that, i dont want to tell him something wrong

The spot where the series are made could overheat and glow. That's where It needs to be beefed Up. A single strip at wide open throttle could cause you trouble. I don't have photo edit on this phone but i guess you capture the idea. Add more layers there at every series.

i grabbed a pc around, i hope i explain myself better now
these are the weak spots:
![weak1|375x500](upload://vfGiuhduPYWZ41c4NaSjJefuypa.jpg)


![weak2|375x500](upload://2gx1i1HcuJRahIhjW0wPM0nZx48.jpg)

that pattern is ok for common performance but risky for 100 amps draw. those places Will heat very much and could glow and be destroyed at full throttle.

![sol2|375x500](upload://61XaG795gqcaVdWNF2m9nMRw5oe.jpg)

i'd beef them up like this. More nickel layers or copper braids soldered between contacts

What rojitor said is correct ;) Use at the black lines more layers

i don‚Äôt envy you welding all that nickel. that shit takes forever. i switched to 25mm wide strips for my double layer packs and cut the weld time to a third.

I don't know but given that its 25mm x 0.2mm vs the twin rows of 10mm x 0.2mm i was using, and takes fewer welds.. and isn't relying on welds on top of welds to transfer energy between cells in either series or parrallel groups... 

my gut tells me a lot more than it was. I'm sure one of these math kids can add it up for you.
