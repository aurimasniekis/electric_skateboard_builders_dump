Hey guys,

I have a normal mlt-Bt05 module. It worked for the last half year with maniacs 2.54 and dual focbox just perfect. Now I updated to 3.38 and vesc tool. I switched from 115200 to 9600 checked the connections but somehow the module gets recognized in every app like (metr, orignal vedder vesc app, and ackmaniacs) but when I want to press something it says esc not connected. Did I miss something in the vesc tool? 
Maybe someone knows more.


Thank you very much guys!

Hi !

I know there is some trouble with some Android versions and some BT modules. It all started with Oreo iirc but you should look for this on this forum.

And for helping you faster, give us some informations like your Android Version, you phone model (just in case) and maybe a pictures of your BT module (both sides) to help identify it.
