Are there any good hub motors that can run on 12s?

Nearly all hubs “can” run on 12s but some will just be better than others, carvons or hummies are the current best. Chinese copies also work ok if your not worried about a bumpy ride

@Hummie Hubs. hit him up if you want high performance hubs if thats what you're looking for given that you're asking about 12s Carvons are also an option if you prefer the motors to be outside the hub.
