Hi eSk8 builders!

I want to choose a better remote for my build. 

1) Currently I use the cheapest and the most simple remote, that is also quite bulky and does not fit into my pocket (can be bought for 16$ on eBay): http://www.ebay.com/itm/2-4Ghz-mini-W1-remote-controller-w-receiver-for-electric-skateboard-longboard-/182455651618?hash=item2a7b344d22:g:vDoAAOSwLF1YBIwJ 
I also don't like the steering wheel it has.

Here are the other options:
2) TorqueBoards Nano remote for 60$ (one of my favorites so far): diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-2-4ghz-nano-remote-controller/
3) Enertion remote for 116$ (nice, but expensive): http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/nano-x-enertion-2-4ghz-controller/
4) Winning remote for 40$: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2-4Ghz-Plastic-Remote-Controller-W-receiver-for-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard/32787913157.html?spm=2114.13010308.0.0.OGIVWO
5) Benchwheel remote for 39$ (this is probably more compact design from the budget options than others and has 2 speed modes): https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Electric-skateboard-refitting-parts-remote-control-bench-technology/32731985084.html?spm=2114.13010308.0.0.LEZdB0
6) Kowheel remote for 9$ (not sure, if it will work with 2.4Ghz receiver): https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Updated-Koowheel-controller-for-D3M-electric-skateboard-remote-control-for-longboard-D3M-key-for-D3M-skateboard/32800995614.html?spm=2114.13010308.0.0.LEZdB0 

What do you think of these remotes? Are there any other remotes, that you prefer to those listed here?

1) is also available on Banggood, cheaper: https://goo.gl/6k9Wz9
You can possibly take the "steering" wheel off by undoing the screw in the middle, dunno.

Both 2) and 4) are Winning remote, but 2) is version 2 of it.

You won't be able to use 6) as there is no receiver for DIY board.

5) should be a very high quality and overall good and recommended remote but there are some reports that latest batches have some issues with receivers. I have one but not in use at the moment so I cannot comment on that.

There is also a Steez or Maytech remote: https://goo.gl/jjxpFd

I use Winning v1 ATM and it has been working without issues, knock on wood :)

I have 4 Benchwheel remotes and it's been great for me, though on my dual 6355 build the receiver cuts out for some reason. I don't think it's strictly the receivers fault though as it runs on my dual 5065 build just fine. I'm getting a winning v2 to replace the remote on the 6355 build. 

Whatever you do, don't buy the winning v1 remote. Notorious for being unreliable.

@Jinra, Benchwheel remote is indeed super comfortable comparing to Nano-X, Winning or Mini. I like it the best. BUT, they definitely have some issues with their receivers. One of them just died for me unexpectedly without reason. I've got replacement and was super excited for 2 days, until I got disconnected once after 18km ride. Now I lost any trust, because losing connection once per 100km is much worse than losing it more often. You cultivate a trust and start riding more careless and then suddenly shit happens :confused:

I agree. I have a lot of the BW remotes, and while they've never died on me, I have had a couple disconnections when at full brake. The nano/winning v2 has been working 100%, besides a disconnect incident due to low battery though!

The reaction time is very slow. It would suddenly lost connection, but if i hold down the button long enough, it will suddenly accelerate

What's up with everyone complaining about dropouts. My batch works fine, not sure why everyone else is having problems. The reason I sell them is _because_ they work fine. And yet everyone else here sings the opposite song. Anyone care to explain?

(You have to caibrate them everytime you turn on the board. Or maybe it's an issue with the deadband?)

I think is more depends on the location. When i was riding in the park it works perfectly fine, but i noticed that once i goes near those electrical boxes or places with a lot of buildings it iwll lost connection

Wait... I had a perfect post about this.. Let me dig it up.
Found it. Here you go:

[quote=RedEagle]
The dropouts occur with some people because either their ppm connection isnâ€™t secure enough or they were in a highly conjested area.

Some also reported that using carbon fiber enclosures will result in a dropout because carbon fiber blocks the signal.
[/quote]

This sums it up perfectly /\

um. . .  so it is a known issue then. Any other remote that don;t have this issue?

Is kinda embarrassing to lost control in front of a lot of people

Are you sure the VESC/ESC didn't suddenly lose power or restart? That would cause the same type of behavior.

Sure, cos if i just keep holding the trigger it will accelerate again. If the VESC lost power, i will need to restart it. 

Also, it always happen at the same locations

VESC reboots are automatic and you don't need to reset it manually.

The Vedder RF-remote that i have has had zero issues so far, and i have been riding nearly 500km. And it's easy to use. The Wii nunchuk feels a bit bulky when i put it in my pocket, but have been thinking of modifying it to be more slim.

Hello,
I got this VESC 6 ([http://www.trampaboards.com/vesc-6-complete--vedder-electronic-speed-controller-trampa-exclusive-p-24166.html ](http://www.trampaboards.com/vesc-6-complete--vedder-electronic-speed-controller-trampa-exclusive-p-24166.html))

and this remote control, the maytech one with the thumb push button: [http://www.trampaboards.com/remote-control--receiver-p-24243.html ](http://www.trampaboards.com/remote-control--receiver-p-24243.html)

I am disappointed by how flimsy the remote feels and I can not get a good connection between the remote receiver and the VESC. Sometimes it works, sometimes not.

I am on my second remote and I am having the same issues

It is so frustrating.

What sort of remote + receivers are people using with a vesc 6 that they are happy with.

Thank you
```

anyone find a way to make a receiver pair with the new meepo remotes that have 4 modes? (Modes are super useful)

This is what I'm talking about:  http://www.diyeboard.com/new-version-4-speed-mode-24ghz-remote-controller-rc6-for-eboard-p-666.html

would love if someone  did. flipsky came out with a similar looking one with a reciver but then took it off the market.

this one works well, @mmaner has tested it and we carry it as a budget build remote

I just bought the mini remote, maybe I'll do a custom case for it, to avoid that big shape it have

There's definitely a few DIY ones here on the forum either built up from simple breakout boards or by pulling the guts from known good transmitter/receiver pairs and then rebuilding for sleeker look and feel (in general).

Few of us chatting here about ours https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-take-on-an-eskate-remote-controller/56827/ Can also checkout @solidgeek's design search for "nrf remote" to find his thread with instructions links etc. I've personally had a lot of luck I guess with my own nrf based one and haven't had many issues, the biggest problem I've had is potentiometers "going bad" or just "being bad" so I'd lean more towards using the linear hall sensor or something else more reliable (or I guess find a known good source for potentiometers, but imagine they all have some wear issues with the wiper moving often).  Aside from my potentiometer issues though the communication part has always been pretty reliable (picking a channel that is less used in your area may affect this along with adjusting power level and bitrate).

^small unlisted vid can see how far away from the board I can get before I lose connection and this is just a regular NRF with the on board antenna if you get one with the power amplifier and external dipole antenna it works at least a city block away (tried with my RC car got as far as I could see it).

Just saw this pop up recently too, not really the design one would want for esk8 but electronics is all the same and sure people can get creative with the case design

It really depends on what you want.
If you want something tried and tested (and budget friendly) then look at the mini remote or the nano remote linked above. 

If you're willing to do some modification and have access to a 3d printer, both the mini remote and the G2B (another tried and tested remote) have modifications available to make them more esk8 friendly.

If you're looking for something a bit more technical, the feather remote by @StefanMe or the Firefly nano by @DroidSector offer VESC data on the remote itself. Because of the increased featureset and decreased scale of operations the price is significantly higher, but you get what you pay for.
