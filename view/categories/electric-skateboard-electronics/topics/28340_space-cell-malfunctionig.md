I said not being kept in storage at the necessary voltage, led issue, or possibly bms

Nothing is wrong, the lcd is reading the charger voltage. You charger is pulsing, some kind of C-C charging

Engineer's check: Keep it plugged in for a bit, if there's no magic smoke, weird smell or excessive heat it's probably fine. If the battery's voltmeter reads a higher value than before, sounds like it's charging :D

You also could send a message to Enertion directly, they probably know more about this specific issue.
