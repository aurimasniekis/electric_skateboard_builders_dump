Looks like a T-motor ESC housing.

Have them on a big multirotor and am seriously contemplating throwing a spare I have laying around on the board and forgetting the whole VESC thing together. That stuff just got out of hand... nearly everywhere they are trying to charge near EUR200,- now to get one to my doorstep. Madness.

They told me it was a prototype, not a final design.

Thats all i know.

Cool. When will you have them done and what will you be asking for them?

I talked a bit with Eileen from Maytech. She said that it is a Hw 4.X based esc, separated in 2 PCBs for better cooling and reduction of the interference between the parts. And that for now it is only a prototype. No infos on possible hardware changes vs. Hw 4.12.
