I recently starting wiring my electric skateboard and this is my third so im not new to the concept of wiring a bms, I wired 5 2s 5AH lipos in series, connected all balance wire to connector and checked with multimeter and all cells were balanced and in ordered. I wired the battery negeative to the B- and the C- to the negative charge port and the positive of the battery to the positive of the charge port. When I plugged it in to charge it went red and charged for 5 mins before going green despite not being near fully charged then a few hours later it started working again but for some weird reason if I toughed the heatsink (which I have currently taken off to inspect the bms) the charger would go green then when I take my hand off it would go red again and recently it is just staying green. Please help me find the issue as this is very frustrating, Kind regards, Adam
