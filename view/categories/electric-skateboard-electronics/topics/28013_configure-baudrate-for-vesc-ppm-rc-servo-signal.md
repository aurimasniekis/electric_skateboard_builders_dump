Hello,

I have a simple arduino controller that I am trying to set up to communicate with the VESC, but I am having difficulties to get it going.

Is the PPM baud rate 115200 by default? Can that be changed in the BLDC_Tool to 9600?

Thank you

Yes it can
Enable PPM+ UART
Click the UART Tab and adjust Brad rate then write configuration 

Telling this from memory so hope I got the steps correct.
