Hi all

I did a quick search on the forum and didn't find any mention of the [LG M36](https://ru.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/lg-inr18650m36-3600mah-10a.html) cells
As i'm building a long range board (12s9p botton and 12s14p top) i read here, that the [Samsung 35E](https://ru.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/samsung-inr18650-35e.html) are "to go with" cells
on [nkon](https://ru.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/samsung-inr18650-35e.html) i saw the LG cells which are a little bit pricier (3.10€ vs 2.65€) but also have a bit more mah (3600 vs 3500) and same amps (10A vs 10A)

Has someone used them before? Are they good/reliable?

It would be cheaper to just use the 35e and have an extra 2-3p giving you more range. When building a pack you should base it on wh/$ not how many mah each cell have compared to another

To check your cells. Since most don't have such huge packs we need cells with more power than that.

@pat.speed i can't do 2-3p more as my board will already be full with batteries
On a daily commuter board, lets say 30km, this might be right.
But I need it for way more than 30km

So I don't care if it costs a bit more
If the cell is worth it, i'm willing to pay a bit more

@Benjamin899 what's this site for?

There are various grahphs on li ion cells
Like discharge rate - voltage etc

It can help you find what cells to use

It would be cheaper

Sometimes the space it takes-up or the weight is more important than cost.  It all depends on needs

So the Samsung is a bit flatter and drops a little later

Will this make the additional 100mah useless or is the drop high enough?
Also i guess the wave-line of the lg won't make any difference when riding

It sure looks like the LG M36 are better than the Samsung 35E for esk8 ... at depths of 6P to 7P or more

Unless you plan on discharging to 3.00V or lower, then use 35E instead
