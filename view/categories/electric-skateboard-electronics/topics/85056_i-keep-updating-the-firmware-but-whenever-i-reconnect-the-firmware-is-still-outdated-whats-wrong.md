I keep updating the firmware but whenever I reconnect, the firmware is still outdated. What's wrong?

My Maytech VESC`s came without the bootloader installed which lead to the same result you have. Try to install the bootloader with the VESCtool, after that your vesc will update to the latest firmware.
