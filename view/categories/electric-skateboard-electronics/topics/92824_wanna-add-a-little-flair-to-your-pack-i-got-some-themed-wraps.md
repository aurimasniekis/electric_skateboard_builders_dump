All for 18650's

I've got:

- pickle Rick [1 left]
- bloody pickle Rick [3 left]
- pizza [4 left]
- watermelon [4 left]

I have 4 of each. These are freebies, I figured some of you may want some fun in your packs. Limiting one per person for now.

Too bad it would pretty much be wasted on my oddly shaped and completely hidden battery pack, watermelon sounds pretty wavy ðŸ˜‚
