Hi there!
I'm new and very inexperienced about building my own skate, I got a ready to ride at first and now I wanna upgrade, I found an Evolve bamboo gt deck with the gt trucks for cheap, and I wanna buy it to make my own... but I don't know pretty much anything about matching the several components.
So this is my plan but I'm eager to know more from people who knows more!
I want to use a double VESC setup with 50mm motors (or is anyone has info of using a 63mm on these trucks even better), for the battery I have to wait until I see how much place I got in the battery case... but my problem is I don't know exactly which electrical components do I still need, surely the remote and I reckon the power on/off button... do I miss anything?

It is doable, but first you should read more, we wont shout all the informations on you, just use the search button and read a little...

This is a little bit older post, but still a [good start](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/start-here-faq-for-diy-electric-skateboard-builders/215)

Sorry for being negattive...I hope you get what I mean...
