I know that VESCs can run FOC, but is the hardware inside a FocBox actually more durable?

there are Vescs that can't handle FOC for example.
If you plan on running FOC, to be safe, just get a quality VESC like ollin or Focbox.

The Focbox has surface mounted FETâ€™s and the base is used as a heat sink.
I believe they are more durable than a standard Vesc without heat sinks.

Maybe it is also important to note that the FocBox actually IS a VESC. 
So the question would have to be wether a FocBox is more durable than a traditional 4.12

I"m still using 4.10/4.12 from various places. 1/4 failed due to cold solder joint I think.

**the focbox looks a bit more user friendly than a heat shrink wrapped pcb..**
but at the price ollin vesc has pretty much the best customer service you can find.
unless you just set random ass number and fry a drv from being careless....then thats on you....

when it comes down to it, the hardware is 99.999999% the same. the software is 100% the same.

Go with ollin or focbox and you will be fine
