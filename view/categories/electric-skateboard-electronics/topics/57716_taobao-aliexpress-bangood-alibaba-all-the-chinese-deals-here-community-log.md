I have seen some post about buying stuffs from TaoBao. I was wondering wehter someone ended up with actually buying something, like motors, vesc ecc...

For instance I have just found this drop down deck that looks decent to me.

Maybe we could keep this thread for all the good quality/price deals from chinese online store, such as Taobao, Aliexpress, Bangood ecc... I would say as general rule we need to post name, URl, picture, price and review in case we had the chance to test it. Other users can leave as reply their review if they tested it or a link for another similar deal.
So for instance for the mentioned deck

- Drop Down Deck https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=540287331249&ali_refid=a3_430008_1006:1121046267:N:4%E8%BD%AE%E6%BB%91%E6%9D%BF%E8%BD%A6:e0c1d57c99b16caa60d003a33f9db136&ali_trackid=1_e0c1d57c99b16caa60d003a33f9db136&spm=a230r.1.0.0

![eBjSZFBXXagMXXa_!!901746532|500x500](upload://aQlPHKBc1At6rXVcSZomqPIIanZ.jpg)

45$

Not tested yet.

I think it could be usefull/practical to have all the deals together. We all know that the quality comes with a price, but. you know. something you want to build without break the bank for it :laughing:

Ciao ciao

I have a private agent, I once bought some remotes direct from taobao seller. But I wouldnt waste my time asking the seller.

Most of the time they are scared/cba of shipping overseas
Or can barely speak a word of english so you both use translator and process gets stressful

And just put of curiosity do you get cheap shipping costs from China or do you use fast forwarders but more expensive? I always wonder how they can sell stuffs at 0.7$ and still be free shipping on AliExpress.
```

## \#11 Posted by: moon Posted at: 2018-06-03T22:38:14.232Z Reads: 597

```
When you actually get something from aliexpress they use the cheapest and slowest shipping possible. Then bulk ship many packages by air to reduce cost. Thats why the items on aliexpress are so cheap and shipping is usually free. Shipping is usually free because the seller has included it in the cost.

Lets say you buy m4x10 bolts, they probably cost less than 0.03$. You decide to buy 10 from a seller on aliexpress which is priced at 2$. Well the cost of the item is is 30 cents and some of its shipping.

Also this http://fortune.com/2015/03/11/united-nations-subsidy-chinese-shipping/

I dont know too much about it and its kind off topic but if you order something from a factory 

You really have 2 options

Express and sea shipping. Express shipping is like DHL and fedex. These packages can come to your door in like 4 days, sometimes less

It is possible to get cheaper shipping solutions like china e-packet (whatever its called) but this is for orders less than 1kg usually. (i think never used it)

Verdict, aliexpress is fine if you want to wait. Taobao is great if you want to struggle finding parts etc. In the end you probably spend around the same sometimes taobao can be expensive if you order heavy(or long items e.g. deck). But you can use express shipping to save time

```
Perfect, thank you for the explanation! So basically if you add the shipping costs to your items you can save money on TaoBao if your order more items at the same time. Of course you also need to take into account custom duty, since you use express air curries.
```

## \#13 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2018-06-04T05:47:57.714Z Reads: 537

```
I think what he was meaning is that the cost for shipping is already included in the price and the way they can do that so cheaply is because they ship lots of packages together
```

## \#14 Posted by: rey8801 Posted at: 2018-06-04T05:50:35.342Z Reads: 534

```
Yes of course. I was taking about TaoBao. Since you usually choose a fast shipping method the price is higher, so it would be better to buy more small parts at once and ship them together.
```

---
## \#15 Posted by: moon Posted at: 2018-06-04T12:20:51.593Z Reads: 502

Yes but quite a lot of small parts is required to make worthwhile

@Hummie replied but he can not post in thread. He is the second one who has this problem, I am goona ask to @moderators whether they know if I did something wrong when I created the thread...

Hummie reply:
"hi it wont let me post in the thread for some reason! never happened before. should be getting them today. the difference is these are stated to be able to do foc but maytech and diyt they tell you you shouldn’t. if its just talk or with pieces to back it up I will find out."

So he will let us know whether they are good or not!

Decks are one thing I wouldn't trust coming from China.

Firstly, because its an easy thing to cheap out on and you can't tell right away.
Secondly there's a ton of domestic decks available super cheap.

For instance:

https://www.otherplanetskate.com/collections/decks

$25 and $30 California made decks that used to sell for quite a lot, but just they now need to unload.

Not a unique scenario.

Yeah I also had never heard of this brand, on their shop they also have samsung 30q cells but without the samsung brand on it and they say they are the exact same cells only unbranded so they can sell them cheaper.

So the deal is, small board, small battery (wh) go with 18650+ since they can discharge more amps and will sag less

if you have a big battery go with 18650s cheaper and slimmer

Just found this hub motor, looks actually very nice:
https://www.banggood.com/W4-N6364-1200W-Hub-Motor-For-DIY-Electric-Longboard-Skate-Board-p-1273820.html?rmmds=detail-bottom-alsobought__2&cur_warehouse=CN
I only can't find the kV rating of this motor which goes up to 6S, I guess around 120kV.
200$ for these dual hubmotors isn't that bad.
I would like to try them but I have recently bought a hubmotor kit, otherwise I tried these for sure :sweat_smile:

Looks like the motor from diyesk8 only they are sensored:

I had that motor. Dickyho is selling it... the phase wires are really thin... It worked pretty good and could pull me from a dead stop I'm 180lbsish eventually I had to replace the wires to 12awd because the thin one burned and got ripped. I had to ripout the hall sensor ro resolder the wires

Edit; found it on eBay from dickyho

Stumbled upon this 30 degre "percision" baseplate for our calibers (well anything with a randal geometry). It's a bit more expensive than buying a 44 degree plate from sickboards with shipping, but would like to know if anyone has any experience with it? Turned up empty handed on a search of /r/longboarding, but I feel like these are super close to the rogue percision bases. . . I'm probably going to order a single piece to see how they fit and how a 30 degree spit on the rear would feel, hope they aren't junk.

Hi everybody!

I have told earlier that I bought Littokala 26650 5Ah cells which can handle 25A continues.
They arrived a few weeks ago but I've been very busy because exams.
![IMG_20180813_212623|375x500](upload://jFGxCsbKiDQOjhcC1mn0qpM36c9.jpg)

My first plan was making 2 packs (10S2P) and make a swappable pack but the plan is changed because of the long shipping time. They were nicely packed, checked every voltage and they look great. All cells were at 3,81-3,82V.
I've now 45 of these cells. The shipping time was like 5 weeks. After 2 weeks I decided to make a pack with 30Q cells, just because I don't like to wait :smile:
I wanted to ride my esk8 and made a 10S4P with 30Q cells.

So now I have 45 cells and I'm not planning to use them anymore so I will sell 2 of these 10S2P packs or other configurations are also possible (with bms, connectors, charge plug, heatshrink,..). I will always test them and do a range test, but I'm pretty sure it will be a nice pack.
If anybody should be intrested pm me, I will also make a thread about this but that will be for after my last exam (4september).

I paid around 200€ in total for 45 cells with custom costs, I guess that's the reason the shipping took so long.

Just a quick update, the real life job has been keeping me busy and away from building, but the baseplate (and a million other things from month old orders out of china) finally made it after a month in transit. I'll throw some pictures of it up tonight, but for now ill just give you my initial thoughts.

I got the black anodized version, and the anodization is not bad, looks to be pretty even across the plate. Its built solid, cuts are smooth, however the one concern I have is that the mounting holes are elongated on both sides, so there is a potential for this to shift around under the board after mounted, not sure why they wouldn't just design it like a standard truck with oldschool and newschool mounting patterns. The kinpin is of the hollow variety, but seems to be of good quality. It includes two nuts, one standard mount and one to reverse mount your kingpin. It also came with a cup and flat washer to accomdate standard sized bushings. I was able to easily pop a cal II hanger in without much slop,  I'll attempt to fit a riptide / venom pivot cup in them soon. haven't mounted it to a deck yet, but again ill try it when i get some time. So far it seems to be worth the $1 auction with with $19 of shipping, i think figuring out if the riptide pivot cup works will be the determining factor.

Lastly, I'm 99% sure Ive found the maker of this based on the company brand image that was imprinted on the bottom of the baseplate: https://www.cootrucks.net/shop,
 from the pictures, this seems to be the M2 baseplate. 
 Based on this randomly sleuthed page, it seems that they should be able to fit riptide cups https://www.cootrucks.net/blank-5 

@Alphamail, do you know what they mean by " the new one can use riptide biggest pivot cup!" ? do you happen to know off your head which pivot they designed this after. I'll get the calipers out and measure it when i get the time as well.

hope this helps someone!

Newly (today) announced Riptide R1X is using that same remote.

Looks like the link is compatible with those "standard" China ESCs.

Yea exactly, no one has unless you got to see the thread in the 10 minutes it was up before being removed.
diyeboards posted a rage thread saying someone was "frauding" him 1000USD and went on to post personal info about the buyer, his father, either his father or the buyers fiance including addresses, emails, names and even full credit card details with exp date and cvv number.

Gave no explanation on what happened or what they had done to apparently "fraud" him.  
For all we know he sold another dodgy setup that snapped in half and refused to fix it so got charged back.

I see a bunch of US sellers still at around $50

Most sellers suspiciously are in Rowland Heights CA. One in dirty jersey though, with 99.9% feedback...

Hello here's a small update on this motor for £40

It arrived today and so far I'm pleased with the quality.
@Benjamin899 I was happily surprised that it came with silicone wire, however, @pat.speed is correct and the wires feel quite thin at 12awg. It's that acceptable? Or am I going to have to upgrade to a thicker wire?

Edit: 
I would like to add that I'm pairing it up with a 
flipsky 4.12 vesc I got for £40. (Its normally £45 but they accepted my offer)

no point in upgrading the wires unless you re-wind the motor.  Those wires are the same ones that come straight out of the motor.  Splicing 3 inches of 10awg on the ends of the motor windings isnt going to change much.  That said, at the price, run the motor for a while and see if it burns up.  Depending on your use case, I'll bet the leads will be fine

Sadly I misread the label on the wire and its turn out to be 16 AWG wire. Just something people might want to know if your planning on buying this motor.

Hi, guys hobbyking has got a good sale on again on lipos. These are a low c rating but your build might not need too much power. A 3s for £9.
Also get 10% off with hobbyking10. This code can be used multiple times which is nice. :slight_smile: I now have a 12s 2p for about £63 that should be able to put out 40amps running the batteries at 4c recommended for long life.

Keep in mind, it's a 10A esc. That means at 10s, 37V, the board will have about 370W of power. Compared to a Boosted (2000W) or what is typical around here (4000W), it's very underpowered. A big motor won't help if you can feed it with electrical watts

Anyone know of a CAN cable on Ali, Banggood or some other site with cheap/free shipping?

Familiar with crimping so could possibly diy it, is it just standard connectors and cables or something special (im not familiar with the communication protocol used on the vescs except for the uart and ppm on master vesc)

That 6374 has a 10mm shaft

Thank you @LukePL for point out this is my deck. I do not wish to have my manufacturers revealed here though.

Imagine if someone found enertions focbox unity manufacturer and started getting focbox unities and selling them... People would be getting banned if that happened. I think the standards should apply across the board and this issue should be modified into the community rules. I don't think the community should allow the free distribution of suppliers of products others have poured their time and money creating.

Where’s mine!  I’d be surprised to see it as they told me people were trying to buy it but they were saying no.   Why?  I think because I sell it cheap and I sell a lot of them.  The shipping for a single deck would be expensive. But maybe I’m wrong and it’s up there somewhere.

You should be beefing with your supplier, not the "community". If it's secret don't work with people you can't trust.

I'm thinking, trust == relationship == making money together. So I doubt you can get enertion's fab to make unities for you, as enertion can and will switch suppliers (and sue), and the fab won't want to lose the large volume enertion brings, for a 100pc order.

I believe Enertion uses multiple suppliers if they can, for redundancy. They probably only drop supplies who screwed them in some way, bad batches or prices or selling their secrets. :) In which case I guess you have a good chance of getting the same bad batch.

just explicit tell them not to make pictures or put them online, and check your suppliers alibaba page. Mostly if you ask them to remove they will do that.
