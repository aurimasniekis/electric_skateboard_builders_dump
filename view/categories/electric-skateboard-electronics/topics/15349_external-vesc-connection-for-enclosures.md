I got tired of haviing to take my enclosure off my deck everytime I wanted to make config changes to my VESC so bought these, thought other people might like this solution as well.

Mount this to the enclosure, its USB A female on the other side.

Connect this cable (DIY VESC Cable), from the inside of the panel mount to the VESC.

Then connect this from the outside of the panel mount to your PC.

Here's a diagram of the USB panel mount.

I got the USB Feedthru Panel Mount in from Amazon today.  Drilled a hole, connected the cable from the VESC to the inside of the feedtru mount and screwed down the mount.  Connected the cable from the mount to my PC and started up the BLDC tool, found the VESC with no problems.

Very simple install, I would recommend for everyone.

I will mention, the USB Feedthru Panel Mount did NOT come with mounting screws, I just a couple I had on hand.  I also used some hot glue on the panel mount side of the cable to keep if from vibrating loose.

You can see the Feedthru Panel Mount on the side/bottom of the enclosure.

This is what the Feedthru Panel Mount looks like in the package.

What about a Bluetooth connection?
Isn't there a Bluetooth module for the vesc?

There is but you don't get the complete BLDC tool features.  I have only done this in 1 board, but I'll more than likely do it on my red ember /psychotiller build and my jet spud 33.  It's nice to have.

I am thinking of doing this as well, just to be ultra clear the board works fine even when the cable is plugged into the VESC? Also, do you have anything to protect the external port from water or dirt or anything or is it fine just like that?

Also, when I click the link for the external port, the only buying option shows it as 37 dollars which seems waaaaay to high, any solutions?

EDIT
 
found this on eBay

and this, since yours is out of stock

Would these all work?

I bought mine months ago, I guess the price changed.  The links you gave appear to be the same thing.

There's also this, it's what I'm going to use in my Red Ember board with Psychotiller AT's.  I'm going to 3d print the ports into a plate and then mount with hot glue.

Or you could get this instead of the switch plate, you just drill a hole.

I am using a male Mini USB to female Micro USB connector. Now my VESC uses the same cable as the GT2B, and I can easily access the USB port for programming.  I bought 25 micro USB covers from China for $1

Don't they have to be mini usb and not micro usb to fit the VESC?

Depends on the VESC, different sellers use different USB types.
