I did the same thing as I couldn’t find reasonably priced 12s ones, it hasn’t arrived yet but as I understand you just wire it normally leaving the last wire not connected

12s, 50.4v. The bms pretty much just doesn’t realise one cell is not connected. It’s also possible to connect 2x 6s bms into a 12s but the info got mixed up between myself, deckoz and someone else, now none of us knows
