Okay, so I am at a cross road where I have to choose between Li-po and Li-ion, I know about the differences in price and the safety of both and the differences. I need help deciding which to pick, on top of requiring this battery to be 12s, and give me a range of at least 12 miles, I want to have a BMS, but i feel like if i added that on myself i would break it, I also want it to have an on and off switch (which i know is on the bms by default, but im not quite sure how that works), I also want it to have a charger port so I can leave it charging into the wall and not have to worry about it blowing up or overheating or overcharging and messing up my other board components. If anyone could give me advice on how to do these things or what to pick, that would be very helpful. Thank you!!

What kind of budget are you looking at here?  There are some companies like DIYElectric and some users on the forum who sell complete battery packs with all the things you are looking for.  Might be a good option for you if you are worried about soldering or wiring something incorrectly.

I run 4 LiPo batteries from Hobbyking in a 12S configuration.  They are each 3S and are wired together on a SuPower BMS.  I have an XT-60 for charging wired in as well.  It was definitely a bit challenging the first time, but there are many articles on this forum about wiring up a BMS unit and I think if one were to spend some time and read a bunch of them, you may be able to make a more educated decision.

For me, the LiPos work great.  Minimal voltage sag in my dual motor setup and great discharge rates.  They are not as safe and I will have to replace them around probably 300 cycles but they didn't cost me a whole lot either.

You could definitely do that with 4 3S batteries like I did, and a SuPower BMS for like 40.  I think mine was a total of just under 200 for the batteries and bms.  I could link my build but it is very out of date, I need to update it with my latest modifications.

You can use the HobbyKing battery finder, would recommend 30C or above as well as 5000mAh or above.

Given all your requirements, a LION battery seems to be the best fit for you. If you want a charging port, BMS, and the ability to leave it plugged in without worry then LION is the way to go. 

You can always make a battery BMS controlled LIPO, but IMO if you are going to do all that work you might as well get the energy density benefits of LION.

Okay so how do I even connect a bms to a li ion pack& how do I connect a switch for the on / off & a charger port? Can someone point me in the right direction to read / see how this is done

All of that information can be found here by searching. There are many videos on youtube as well. Wiring the BMS for lipos will be the same as with LIONS

For the On/Off switch i would suggest you search this forum for "loop keys", these are the most economical and easy to setup "switches" you can find.

For $200 lipo might be your only option.

Not all bms's have a switch especially the cheaper ones
