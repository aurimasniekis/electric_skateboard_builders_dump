This is a very useful publication to all of us traveling with our batteries:

There is every single airline with current battery limitations. 
What's very interesting **AMERICAN AIRLINES** and **WOW AIRLINES** - does allow **300WH limit** so you can easily take your 10s3p Space Cell with you when traveling.

Which way ''american'' is that? I think it means inter-state flights? Does someone coming from eu will be able to take his 300wh battery with him?

These are all intercontinental flights. You can take your 300wh battery from europe to us.
