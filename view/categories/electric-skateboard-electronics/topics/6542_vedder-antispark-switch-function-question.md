I built one of Vedder's Antispark a while back. Is this suppose to let current flow if the switch is in the off position?

No, if it does then the mosfets are blown. Here's how to fix: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-fix-anti-spark-softswitch/6522/3

The thing is the mosfets are new. I am aware of a mosfet being possibly shorted.

my mosfets were new aswell. Either the part was faulty or it died from the sudden load as I hypothesize in my post.
