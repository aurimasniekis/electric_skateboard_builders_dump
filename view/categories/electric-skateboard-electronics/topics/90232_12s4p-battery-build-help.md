Hey everyone! I finally got my enclosure for my 12S4P in a Loaded Vanguard deck. Pretty stoked to drop 48 Samsung 30Q cells into my board.

![IMG_4223|666x500](upload://rRQFXF1crSFL0jp2H7cOCH1labx.jpeg) 

I started to glue together a 10S2P pack and was about to weld using my new Sunkko 220v spot welder when I saw a few posts...

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/rate-my-battery-build-12s4p-30q/66076

... they seem to have the batteries in a different layout configuration. So now I'm wondering, am I doing this right? This is ultimately going to power a Foxbox Unity. Let me know if I forgot something.

This layout is correct. you should be matching 4 negative terminals together at a time, not staggered like above... Pls see 2 second example below.

Hey @tkc did you check out this thread? Lots of tips in there. 

Also make sure to insulate between the P-groups.

Like @lrdesigns says. Insulate between the p groups. Looking very carefully at the built packs above there does seem to be fish paper in-between the groups.

Yes there is, you have fish paper between pgroups, fish paper between balancing wires and battery and fish paper between the left and right hemisfere of the battery.

So it's pretty safe

Yes, that is really dangerous. A fire will occur definitely sometime in the future if it ever hit the roads.

Hope OP hear us

Can we get back to the original post? I want to setup a 12S4P in an eboosted Vanguard enclosure so it has to be 2 sets of 24 cells, 2 cells high. If someone has a diagram which would be correct and not a fire hazard, that would be great! As much as I like all the scary photos and insults about causing a fire, I'd like to have some help to make sure I set this up right.

Its close... This is where i fucked up in my intital builds... Make 2 6s2p that look EXACTLY the same.. Then when u lay it downyhe both lay the same direction...and this is how you wil have the main positive/negative on the outside... I tried writing it out like u... But this tid bit of info im giving you (which might seem like common battery building sense...but is not) will ensure yur success

if you couldn't understand my wording i meant, its not the diagrams that causes the fire, its people not add fish paper along with using the diagram to build the pack.

Looks like your diagram a few posts above is missing series connections (only connects parallel cell groups). You would also need to flip the pos/neg sides on the top row. 

Here‚Äôs a diagram from another post showing an example of a 10s3p.

![image|690x404](upload://iYxQmQyl8EO0085rqBVdqeB6Kfm.jpeg) 

Some people will make a different type of series connection setup like 

![image|690x404](upload://dwW5PdFVye7I5GKIpFRZ534pXzS.jpeg) 

It‚Äôs a rough pic but hopefully you see what I mean. In this scenario you would only cross across the to the other row once. I don‚Äôt use this type because it seems like it would be far easier to short, but some other people seem to like it so if your safe about it and use proper protection you should be ok.

When I build a battery myself I‚Äôll see exactly how many cells I can fit into my enclosure and then choose my battery size. This way you don‚Äôt have to align the cells  in a plain side by side in two double stacked rows like you have above. You can get creative with the way you orient the cells and fit more. 
(But for all I know you did that )

I bought the enclosure from @Eboosted which is a 12S4P enclosure for a Loaded Vanguard (in my original post).

Does this look correct? Orange is series, blue is parallels.

Right that‚Äôs the same as the first one I posted before I drew all over it.

![image|690x404](upload://iYxQmQyl8EO0085rqBVdqeB6Kfm.jpeg) I

It‚Äôs a bit hard to see but the numbers in the middle represent series crossings.

@tkc you can do it the way you showed but I feel like the other way we mention above is a better option. I don‚Äôt like the bending of nickel so I use a brass or copper bus bar and cross over with wire.

I think I see what you're saying. But I wouldn't need to bend anything since I'm going 2 cells high, right? I guess it's slightly confusing because I'm looking at your 10s3p and translating that into 12s4p. Considerable difference for a rookie like me.

We all have to start somewhere.

![image|375x500](upload://qTu7EjF5KK3scThaM0gnKP7zrBK.jpeg) 

I of course ended up smoothing down the solder in the pic above on those bus bars so they don‚Äôt scratch through anything.

The double stack is the same exact concept because your just treating them like fat parallel groups. You‚Äôll connect them through nickel strip something like 

![image|375x500](upload://VxlxNNbHVyWLRHEGYHvk6SGuS6.jpeg) 

You‚Äôll also want to trim the sharp angles off the sides of the nickel edges like I forgot to do in the image above.

Closer... I might have left one tid bit... 2 identical packs glued.. But the nickle will will start different on each pack... Look at the flow from start to.finish.. This helps keeps terminals to the outside...

If you do this the positive and negative leads of the battery will be too close of each other and it won't give you a good seal between the left and right hemisfere.

Do it in a way the positive and negative leads are in the opposite side of the cell
