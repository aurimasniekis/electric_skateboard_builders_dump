Hi there, I have just received an information from Landwheel that if I would buy 5 kits of L3-X or L3-AX the price will be significant less. About 349 each or 400 for the AX version. I am waiting for a reply from landwheel to confirm this information. If this will be correct is there anyone interested in joining me on this deal? Oh and by the way, I am from Portugal, so it means that would be a lot easier to ship the rest of the kits inside Europe only. Thanks
