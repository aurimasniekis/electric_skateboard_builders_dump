Perfect? Probably not. Decent, yes :)

According to reviews the mount is borderline too weak for electric guitars, which usually weigh about 1/2 of what an esk8 weighs. 

I had a stand with kind of similar design that got bent pretty easily if the bass was pushed down on it too much..

That's weird. I know a guy who hangs his Boosted board on a mount exactly like that. Of course using proper longer wall screws and wall inserts, supplied ones are trash. Maybe it just differs from batch to batch, like anything from China.

I hang my board on the hellmet.de mount and even though it has a longer neck, it doesn't show any signs of bending. Board is 6.5kg.

I have 5 different guitars, the heaviest is a 5 string bass with solid mahogany core. When I tried the circle mount it ripped a nice hole in my wall and left an ugly scratch on the finish (nothing I couldn't buff out but still annoying). I now use rectangle mounts with metal studs to make sure that my mounts aren't going anywhere, even if there's and earthquake (oh the life of Cali).
