I totally messed up my motor sensor wires and I want to fix that.
Does the sensor cable I'm going to switch to have to be JST-ZH model?
The only one I can put my hands on at the moment is a JST-SH.

I wonder if it will still work with SH? Or does it have to be JST-ZH?

This is for a Matyech 6355 sensored motor which has 6 pins connector.

Do you mean the sensor wire from the motor itself or the extension wire to (V)ESC (6pin)?

The Maytech motors usually have JST-ZH with 1.5mm pitch, the Vessc JST-PH with 2mm pitch.
(JST-SH is 1mm pitch). Are you from EU? I would have some spares.

The wires from the motor are wracked. The extension wire is all good.

I'm based in Israel. If shipping won't be too high I would love that. :man_with_gua_pi_mao:

Alright, you could just use the JST-PH wire without extension, how long it should be?
I can send you both (JST-ZH and PH 20cm each) as letter by mail for 2â‚¬ :grin:

Can someone please confirm if Maytech motor sensor cable (the one that goes out from the motor) is **JST ZH 6-Pin 1.5mm**?

Would fit but only 100mm length.

But why you want to fiddle around with this tiny connectors and extensions? If you use vesc  I would solder a JST-PH (2mm pitch) cable to the hall sensor wires of the motor without extension.

Do you know where I can buy or how to fix the extension wires that goes in the VESC ? I burned the wires that goes into the vesc and need to get new connectors to these wires ? Any ideas ?
