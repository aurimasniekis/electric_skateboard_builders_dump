Still sort of new to esk8 and hoping for advise on my battery. I was using lipos until they caught on fire... so I upgraded to a 6s4p lion pack with balance leads. I am planning on charging by connecting the balance lead to my balance charger. Is this ok to do? I thought I had read somewhere not to charge in series. Since the pack is wired in series will this be a problem? I don't want another battery fire so any advise would be greatly appreciated!

It's fine as long as you balance-charge them. The individual cells only drift in voltage when you charge them without a balance charger/BMS for multiple cycles.

What will the balance charger show? since its 4 in parallel should each cell on the charger read show  14.1v or the regular 3.7v?

The 4 cells in parallel act like one "big" cell, so no matter how many are in parallel they always will be between ~3 - 4.2V. Your battery pack has 6 of these 4 cells bundles in series therefore the total voltage will be between 18 - 25.2V.

thats right series adds voltage and parallel adds capacitance. Thanks!
What about the anti spark? I had read that I don't need those that it would just spark. But after my lipos getting fire I'm not so sure. I took them off the charger and hooked the two 3s packs together in series and they sparked and immediately puffed them caught fire. I would prefer not to have the anti spark if it is not necessary but safety first.

I would advise an anti spark switch or a loop key

That's sounds more like the LiPos shorted. The spark isn't primarily dangerous for the battery, however it damages the connectors and high inrush currents may also have an effect on the ESC.
