It is worthwhile to update the firmware from 3.40 to the latest version because some important bugs has been fixed  or  it is not mandatory and the esc already has a reliable behavior ?

some would say yes, some would say not yet....

it´s like with your newest phone SW/FW... some want to have always the newest version, other people like to wait till all the issues are fixed before they update to a new version.

It´s your own decision.
