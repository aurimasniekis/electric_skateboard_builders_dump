Hi Guys,

My board just suddenly stopped working. 

I have absolutely no idea what happened, but after taking the mesh off around the phase cables of the motor it seems the plugs were coming out of the sockets and they may have touched when riding.

So I plug the VESC (2.18 BTW) to BLDC and in realtime data I get the DRV802 error.

Have I fried the chip?

How hard is it to remplace? I am an avid solderer, but it always scares me when I do something I have never done before...

I have searched online, and cant seem to find anywhere to buy these chips..

Am I better off just getting a new VESC?

I am in Spain BTW.

any input is dearly appreciated.

Sounds like the dreaded drv failure.  I believe @Martinsp does vesc repairs in the EU

Youll need a Hot air solder station, find the component on mouser. Good luck!

Yes indeed, I have seen a couple of videos and it seems to exceed my abilities with desoldering and resoldering chips on PCBs

Just dont keep the air flowing on one spot, move it with your hand over the entire chip and pcb and be patient until it loosens. Use plenty of flux when resoldering the new one, line it up properly and apply hot air on the groundpad before putting down the chip, keep heating it up until u happy with aligning it.

Stereoscope for inspection when done
