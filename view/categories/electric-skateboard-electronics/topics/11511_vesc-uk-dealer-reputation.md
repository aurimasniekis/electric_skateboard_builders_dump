Anyone bought from here?: https://www.scramboards.com/vesc-vedder.html

Also, can anyone make out where the connection is for the motors bullet connectors?

Thanks, 
Cal

I might be wrong but it looks much like aliexpress version. Which might or might not be bad.

I contacted them when i saw them on ebay.  They were quick to respond and answer my question if they contribute to Vedder - which they said they do as a % per.

didn't buy from them, but encouraged they are at least contributing back to Ben.

Did you try in the end to buy from them? I'm looking for a VESC and this one it's the most promising in terms of money-benefits.

It's good to read it. I think that I'll give them a chance after all. Thank you for sharing your experience!
