I'm sure people have run into this weirdness before, I'd just like to know how you deal with it. 

I'm running dual focboxes with split ppm. Both are powered by a 12s4p pack. And they drive 6355's, 

The 6355's are about 100 miles apart. I used one as a single setup for a few weeks before going dual. 

I've tried tuning the motor max to compensate, but is this the advised method? 

I've also tried tuning this with the belts on, and belts off, which one is going to be more accurate? 

How have you guys dealt with this?

first step is to find the kv of each motor. Run the motor on the bench and type 'kv' in the terminal section to find the kv of the motor. Then compare with the other motor.

I do max, but do it a couple times to get a good average.

Pretty much the same kv, which means something else is wrong on your setup. One motor is taking more amps to turn than the other, it could be belt tightness, bad tolerances, bad pulley/mount config, or a number of other things.

Ah okay, thanks for helping me verify the kv. 

If it is something with a mechanical part, does the motors being not in sync have any detrimental effect?

one will work harder than the other which may cause it to heat up more. Either way you're wasting energy that could be put towards propelling you instead.

Probably no danger, but inefficient.

If you switch the ppm connectors between the 2 focbox same thing happens to each motor or does it flip?

Try flashing both to default and start fresh?

I actually already tried that. I had it on 2.18FW and then flashed to ack's 2.53FW and they both showed the same result

Are the motor detection results the same or close between the 2? Ppm signal looks the same in both?

I see, the motors actually showed the same async even with everything off including the motor pulleys.

I'm watching the belt RPM speed as I throttle to different percentages.

I have one motor max at 65 with max watt at 900 and another at 50 with max watt at 850 (both have non-limiting battery maxes), and they spin around the same when setup like that.

belt RPM speed? How are you measuring that? Also I thought you said it was different when you took off the belts too.

with the belts on - I was eyeballing the rate at which the belts would spin using the text printed on the belt. Its very apparent in lower throttle ranges. ~10-20% throttle

with the belts off - I was watching the can, also eyeballing the rate at which the text would spin.

Did you make sure the PPM values are exactly the same? (Check dead zone as well)

He mentioned this happened without belts as well.

@cwazy1 Try swapping PPM on each VESC like @scepterr said and seeing the results.

I've tested without belts and just watching the can rotation speed. Same difference in rpm.

What if you switch motors between vescs? If the behavior is the same it's the motor(maybe bullets), if not it's the focbox

I tried this, same result.. The slow motor is still the slow motor.

Do you have an extra vesc? Try swapping out the slow side.

I would think this is likely due to one motor having sligtly more friction while turning and therefore requiring more current to spin at low speeds. Can you feel any difference when spinning them by hand? Id suggest riding it to see if there is a big temp difference or if it seems to torque steer from uneven power delivery. If niether of those happen i
I dont think you have a real problem.

I think that could be checked by setting each motor to run at like 2k rpm or whatever is considered slow and see what current it draws with no load, could be done at several rpm levels to see where they split

There isn't any noticeable difference in spinning the cans, I'll try to see if I notice any torque steer, but I haven't noticed anything stand out ish in the last week or so of riding it.

You could try switching the slow side vesc to the other side and see if you get the same result? Just trying to see if it's a problem with that vesc/settings

haha, I went out for a 8 mile ride just now, felt fine, nothing abnormal and board pulled dead straight. Its just aesthetically strange to have a motor take much longer to stop when giving throttle while upright.

I personally have never had both motors spin equally.  Understand that every electronic piece of an eskate build  expects to run under a load, so bench results are not very usable.
