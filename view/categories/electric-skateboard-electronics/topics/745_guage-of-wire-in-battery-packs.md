So I have some crazy plans. I'm waiting for an x-carve cnc milling machine to arrive and I plan to cnc mill my own hollow decks with it.

I am attempting to make a decently thin board with this and as a result, I have decided my best bet to utilize 100% of the inside space is to build my own pack. I'm am planning on either a 10s or 12s configuration, but to keep board thin, I will solder two cells on top of each other and wire the rest together.

My question is does anyone have any advice as to the gauge of wire I should use between cells? 

I was thinking 8 gauge, but maybe I'm not visualizing the flow of electricity correctly, so I just wanted to double check.

I think 8awg will be plenty big enough
even 10 would be fine

@evoheyax we had this [thread about wire gauge][1] a while back that might have some helpful info. GL!

You can go with a higher gauge than 10 awg if they are short lengths but I use 10 awg throughout my builds.

I just need to figure out how I'm going to store it and where to run it, lol.
