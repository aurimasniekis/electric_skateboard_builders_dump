Hey y'all,

I'm planning on building a better boosted this summer, had my fun with the DIYeBoards 10s5p kit last summer and although I've made some upgrades to it I _**hunger for more**_.

I'm going to base my build off of [Deckoz's](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/loaded-vanguard-42-weekend-build/41284/4) build from 2 summers ago as well as Skatemetric's Foosted board.

As my build currently stands its going to use:

Loaded Vanguard Flex 1
Flipsky Dual FSESC4.20 100A
DIY 10s4p battery basically the same as Deckoz's as I know that will fit in the enclosure
Same enclosures as Deckoz's
Flipsky 2.4G Nano Remote
Either the Flipsky 6354 190KV 2450W motors or the 6355 190KV motors from Torqueboards
Generic mounts and pullys (not too worried about this part but I am planning on using [these mounts])(https://www.ebay.com/itm/CNC-motor-mount-for-50-63-motors-for-DIY-eskate-electric-skateboard/302775190943?hash=item467ecec59f:m:ms88LUPN6Vhpnpo8YRvLyng&var=601716797809) 

So my question boils down to whether or not my parts are compatible and if there is anything anyone would change about Deckoz's build that might improve stability and reliability.

Also, In Deckoz's build, he doesn't include a power switch or a battery indicator. Iv'e been doing some digging and I'm seeing that some ESCs have plug and play battery/voltage indicators but how would I go about hooking that up to the Flipsky FSESC?

Additionally, where my build differs from Deckoz’s build is that I want to use Caliper II trucks like on the Foosted, but my issue is that they’re only 184mm wide and I was hoping to use trucks closer to 200mm for stability, what trucks do you all use that are closer to 200mm in size that can mount a… mount?

I’ve been looking around and it appears that almost all mounts are built for Caliper trucks as they have the cornered design that allows the clamp to grip. Are there other trucks that I’m missing out on?

Thanks for any help you can provide, really excited to finally build a full board from scratch!

It might be better if you merged this post with your other post about the trucks. they're almost duplicate threads based on the content. You can get your answers to both questions in a single thread.

Will consolidate them here, separated them cuz one was for electronics and the other was for mechanics.

Why not buy [one of these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MFBQFKG/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)?  No integration required.

Do I literally just solder that to the positive and negative end terminals of my battery?

```
You will have to connect a voltmeter directly to the battery then put a 2 pole switch inline on the negative leg.

You should put it after whatever battery disconnect you have (loop key, e-switch) or have a separate button/switch to keep it from being on all the time.

[I have only used this one so far and I like it](https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Capacity-Waterproof-Indicator-Backlight/dp/B07DYTG5V2/ref=pd_day0_hl_60_4?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07DYTG5V2&pd_rd_r=23b247fa-1fa2-11e9-8398-b3ecd3f33b25&pd_rd_w=ogAAt&pd_rd_wg=NZhBe&pf_rd_p=ad07871c-e646-4161-82c7-5ed0d4c85b07&pf_rd_r=F9K9YSEDPTD7YKSSPQ8E&psc=1&refRID=F9K9YSEDPTD7YKSSPQ8E). You can get it pretty cheap on aliexpress. A bit on the larger side but it fit very well.
