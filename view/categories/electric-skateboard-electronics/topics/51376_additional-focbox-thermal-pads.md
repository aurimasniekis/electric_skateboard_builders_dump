Besides the default thermal pads that come installed on the focbox to cool the fets, has anyone experimented with adding more thermal pads to the DRV chip? Is there any point?

I get the feeling that since they burn out, reducing heat further might help. Please correct me if I am wrong... Maybe it's because of other stuff like shorts and bad settings that heatsinks won't help with... But in general, who here has tried adding additional thermal protection to their DRV or other chips on their VESCs?
