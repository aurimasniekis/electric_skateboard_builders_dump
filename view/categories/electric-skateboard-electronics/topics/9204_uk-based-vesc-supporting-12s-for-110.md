Hi guys, as we know supply is painfully low for anything in the UK.

Came across this site selling VESC's for £110, and they seem to be pretty heavy duty ones at that.
https://www.scramboards.com/vesc-vedder.html

It states they are back ordered but are aiming for delivery in the next week.

Anyone think these will be worth a shot?  Hopefully this helps someone :)

saw those on ebay a few weeks back, they have a interesting split board design. all the fets on one side for a big heatsink.

If you try it let us know how it works. but since it takes a week might be cheaper to just order from ebay...

Hi,

Do you know if they offer a warranty in their VESCs? I could not see it on their website. What has their after sales been like?

Thanks

Khaleel.
