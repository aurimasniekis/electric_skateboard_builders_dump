Hi All,

I know this has probably been asked a load of times. I have had a search but getting confused by all the different threads about bluetooth adapters.

I'd like a bluetooth module for my FocBox so I can monitor my battery level and speed etc. Could someone recommend an adapter that works with iOS and can someone recommend the best app to download from the AppStore for this purpose?

Also does anyone know where I can buy the bluetooth adapter (Ideally in UK or Europe)?
