If I were to take 4 9v batteries and wire them in series to make 36v would it be safe to connect it to my skateboard to test it? (I don't plan on riding it with this setup)

It should be, as far as the skateboard hardware is concerned, but you will quickly drain the batteries and they might get hot and melt/explode.  But it shouldn't hurt the skateboard electronics.  If you don't ever ride on it, it should be fine.  I'm not sure what current rating 9V batteries have, but I imagine it's low.

about 500mA -tha'ts half an amp. many motors/escs will draw that much just being turned on

They will probably last long enough to program the ESC.  That's a guess.  Not reponsible for fires.

Also wouldn't throttle the motors up LoL
