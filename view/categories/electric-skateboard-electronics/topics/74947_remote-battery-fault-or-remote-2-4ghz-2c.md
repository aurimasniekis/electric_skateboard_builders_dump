My remote won't charge, the lights won't come on unless I switch the remote on when plugged in. I think it's the battery. I opened it up and it looks swollen . Can you buy them or is it better to just get a new remote ? 
It's the two speed wowgo style remote.

Did you check the solder joints for the battery to the circuit board? I had the same issue.

your battery looks puffy. Batteries shouldn't look puffy. Puffy battery = no bueno

You can buy them here: https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/502535-3-7V-300mAh-lithium-polymer-battery-for-MP3-player/818305_32215795542.html

Not sure about the exact size of your's so double check to make sure. These battery are very common and easy to find. No need to buy a new remote.

What can cause a remote battery to puff up ?  Over charging ? Cold weather ?
