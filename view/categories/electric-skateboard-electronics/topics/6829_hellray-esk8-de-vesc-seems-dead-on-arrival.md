It is as the title says.

I have followed every instruction to the letter but these things have never shown any sign of life at all. I read that there's supposed to be some LED light showing it is getting power, I have never seen as much as a flash. Connecting it to 13 different USB ports, and 4 power supplies hasn't made a difference. I am at a loss for what to do. They took so long to get here, so much money and now this.

They are all controllable lab power supply's, it was more to test is something was wrong with one of them.

EDIT: After that didn't work we tries 2 different LiPo packs, didn't change a thing.

So you said you only get as much as a flash? Can you elaborate on that? If for example you give it a voltage out of the range set in your settings, it will flash red. If everything's good, you'll get a steady blue and green light.

Pictures are also useful, as close up and detailed as possible. Sometimes, it's easy to see a problem on the pcbs and/or components. One of the vesc wizards on here might spot something.

Have you tried connecting to a computer via the usb port?

Hey thx for trying to help.
I actually said I have NOT seen anything at all from the LED's So I guess I can't answer that. Furthermore, as My computer isn't finding it, nor is my brothers, or either of our laptops, there is no range in the settings. I will update with pictures as soon as I get home again.
