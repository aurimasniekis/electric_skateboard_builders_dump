Hi guys.
I'm almost finished my build, but I still need to order some insignificant parts. One of them is waterproof charging port (M+F). So maybe you can share which port you are using now?

How about you go and search for it?
It is a standard 5.5mm jack.

Pretty sure xt60 is waterproof, if you did it on the charger as well, you could do that as well.

I'm looking for a waterproof jack like this as well. I've currently got one of these but the issue is that the rubber cap sometimes falls out while I'm riding which makes me think I could potentially short the charging circuit if the rubber cap fell out and I rode through a puddle... Has anyone seen similar sockets but with screw on covers?

I've found these but they're not quite what I'm after, the screw on component of this one is only designed to make the socket waterproof when it's actually plugged in...

I used these [connectors](http://www.ebay.com/itm/141984030849)  
A bit bulky, but waterproof? ✔

Are you using it for 10 or 12s? How many amps are you pushing, and does it get noticeably warm?
