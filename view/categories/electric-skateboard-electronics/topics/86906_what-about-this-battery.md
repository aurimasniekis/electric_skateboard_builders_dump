This vendor I believe was blacklisted from the forum for publishing a customers credit card details online.
Theres quite a few opinions of the parts on the forum too.

Looks big, but trash cells will make it sag a lot.

If you want a pack that is going to satisfy you in the long run, that's not it.

40a Max bc utilizing the full 50 makes it sag like a...

A Samsung 30Q 10S5P pack will give you nearly double the range. A 10S5P pack build by @thisguyhere puts you in the 500$ ballpark I believe. Considering the piece of mind that is put in the packs and the gain in range it's not a bad value I guess. Stay away from dieyboards if something goes wrong with the purchase you will end up having lots of trouble, experienced it first hand.

This is an amazing value, the initial purchase cost is higher than the diyeboard pack but the value is twice as good!

I would say these 10s5p are not the worst you could buy (at least value wise) and depending on what your using it for, if your using dual Fox and 64xx's it will suck but for 50xx's and cheap ESC it does the job while you save/learn to build your own.

I've used a couple of these for over a year without issue - noticing one degrading now but its the charged multiple times daily.

Lots of people shit on Diyeboard, they are not as bad as some people seem to think. And as for the scamming part - they only use Paypal so it takes skill for you to loose cash with Paypal ;)

Thank's for your advices guys, 

yeah obviously thisguythere batteries looks pretty interesting but then I'll also need to buy an enclosure that'll fit it.
Right now I'm on a single drive Vesc from Flipsky with Lipos pack (2x 4S) and I'm thinking about going onto a dual ride, the first step is to extend my weak range.

Ownboard are going to release soon their dual belt drive esk8 so maybe they'll also sell separately battery and enclosure as they did it for the oldest boards, and I hope that they will do it :grin:

I'm in France so shipping a battery pack from US would definitively not be cheap, still interesting though because you are the only one !
