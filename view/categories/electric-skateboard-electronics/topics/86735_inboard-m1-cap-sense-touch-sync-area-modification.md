So I recently bought an inboard m1 without battery, charger, or remote. After purchasing everything, the skateboard wouldnt turn, i decided to go ahead and open it up to take a peak at the electronics. The moment i unplugged the "cap sense/touch sync area" the boards lights flickered indicating that the board is recieving power. I went ahead and tried to replace the wire that connected the cap sense to the esc to see if that would fix it and it did not. I was wondering if anybody knew how to make a modification that would replace the cap sense device. It uses five wires to connect to the esc with jst 5 pin connectors.
