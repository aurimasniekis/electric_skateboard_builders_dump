Finding the foot pad controls too coarse and abrupt for safe riding, particularly the braking.  Would a hand control conversion make sense or should I just sell it?

Depends on the boards specs and what could you get for it

How long have you been skating on it for? Is it still hard to get used to? Always wanted to try one of these.

If you can get a nice price for it, I would sell it. If you can't get a good price and you like the rest of the board, a conversion may be possible.

Get a VESC and remote. Before you do the conversion take a look at the zboard electronics to see if there will be any issues. e.g. The old esc is integrated with the BMS. Is there enough room in the enclosure for a VESC and new wiring. etc.

the whole point of z board is the food pads.

if you don't like it. sell it and get a regular board.

Have you contacted Ben about it?  Lots of riders complained about the accel/braking and sent it back for a firmware upgrade.  Maybe a good option to try
