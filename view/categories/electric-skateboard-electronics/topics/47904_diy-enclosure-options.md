I have no idea how to make an enclosure. I have access to a 3d printer, but I'm not really sure if I would trust a plastic one, and I saw these pencil cases in staples and they looked kind of like an enclosure.

What should I do? If you had a similar problem and solved it maybe post your solution here. Thanks!

A common easy and cheap solution are the plant trays you can get from like home depot or Amazon.

Many people make their own enclosure out of vacuum formed plastic (pretty easy and straightforward, but takes some work) or composites like fiberglass or carbon fiber (A much more difficult job, not for beginners.)

I want to see someone make a cardboard enclosure and then laminate it somehow to seal/harden it. Maybe I'll do that for fun

These? they seem like takeout food dishes, are they strong enough? 

also, then I'm assuming screws would crack the edges too.

You joke now, but I've seen duct taped cardboard enclosures.

Someone on here made one for temporary enclosure. He was trying to sell the board. It had 130kv Torqueboards hubs, that's all I remember...think it was 10s

Those are fairly thin, but you can get thicker ones. I'd recommend going to a physical store, that way you can be sure of what you're buying. If possible, pick ABS over polystyrene, it's much stronger.

But i guess what I'm saying is carboard is such a viable crafting/building/constructing/modeling material that can be manipulated in countless ways while maintaining Its structural effectiveness. It's literally one of the greatest inventions of the last 200 or so years

and as far as 3d printing goes? I only have the filaments that came with the printer but it seems decently strong.

how did you attach them? screws/bolts from the bottom of the board with a washer on them?

Most printers come with ABS and PLA. PLA is fairly strong but brittle. ABS tends to develop cracks unless it's printed in an enclosure with heating. It can be done, but there are other options.

Screws with a washer. A rubber washer between the metal one and the plastic can help prevent cracking.

so if I check and its abs then that's an option too? or are they both used, just with some downsides for each?

I personally wouldn't use a ed printed enclosure unless I was SURE it was free of cracks and delamination. Large prints from ABS tend to warp or crack unless your printer has a heated build chamber.

Quick tip for flimsy enclosures: Fasten all your stuff to the board first. The enclosure should only be supporting its own weight, not the weight of your batteries etc.

If you make a really tough enclosure out of plastic or CF, this doesn't apply as much, but for starters, the enclosure should just be there to keep the rocks out, not keep the batteries in.

Don't underestimate the cardboard enclosure. It's actually really nice for complex concave decks since it'll conform to the shape.

Only for the short run. I used a cardboard enclosure for a penny board build and it fell apart after 2 cycles. :neutral_face:

If you have a 3D printer then you have the capability to make exactly what you need for the components you've bought. Not to mention it's super cheap.

PLA is cheapest and easiest but it degrades, so you'll have to do some work afterwards. Fortunately some paint (if you want to paint it) and then an application of Epoxy will seal it nicely, there's lots of articles online discussing this.

If you can print in PETG then definitely use that instead, ABS is also good but harder to print.

Wrapped it in 2 layers of duct tape, eventually got soggy and started touching the ground. :stuck_out_tongue: I would only use cardboard to quick test runs.

That's hilarious. I also used the STÃ–DJA from Ikea, which works really well! The larger compartment is for the battery, and the smaller for the electronics. It's just the right thickness of the plastic - strong but not brittle for drilling holes into (for power button, connections, LCD display, etc).

Wait, nevermind. It's a drawer insert called Billingen http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30270401/ that I used.

is a box on the bottom supposed to give protectiion from more than ricocheting rocks or maybe water?  because if it is i dont trust any of the ones i've seen.  one strong hit to a curb or a speed bump and the box will flex and crush whats inside unless it's a pretty stiff box.  Id rather go minimalist with the thinnest material and not hit curbs and speed bumps.  for years I rode with just my lipos glued to the bottom of my deck.  that failed eventually and then put a layer of carbon on the packs, which was really easy to do, and that worked well.  the only downside was couldnt feel the lipos for temp

I considered that for sure. On the one hand my clearance is rather large due to the 8" pneumatic offroad wheels. On the other hand, my battery has a few layers of different material (plastic shrink wrap, foam, and more) to both protect from puncture/crushing and as padding (vibration, energy absorption, etc). I recommend doing the same, even though that will add thickness. You could also do all of the above inside of a basic plastic enclosure then add a thin sheet metal to the bottom to provide even more protection from crushing/puncture, but also adding weight (though worth it). Definitely don't just glue it to the underside. For now I have about 4 small and tight bungee cords supporting the weight, with the hooks going through holes on the deck along the side. But that's temporary for easy maintenance. I plan on using bolts and nuts (or the wavy pin thing) to more securely attach the enclosure.
