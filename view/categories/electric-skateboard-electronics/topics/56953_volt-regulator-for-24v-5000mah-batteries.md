For my electric longboard I am using 2 3s 5000mAh batteries in series. This was an okay solution because it was affordable. But my biggest problem is that my voltage keeps dropping while riding. Then I heard you could install a voltage regulator to keep the voltage constant. I was wondering if anybody has any recommendations or requirements I need to be looking out for.

Yes the voltage drops. Thats normal. a voltage regulator that withstands 40-60 amps? You'd get better experience and less losses adding another two 3s in parallell. Alot better voltage curve as well.

Sounds great, but how do I connect another two 3s batteries into the circuit? Do you have some kind of special connection parts for that?

```
A voltage regulator will just burn off the excess power as heat and won't solve many problems without creating more.  So if you feed it 32V and it outputs 24V, and you're drawing 40A through it, then 320 Watts is being wasted -- burnt off as heat from the regulator -- which then has to be cooled with a HUGE heatsink

Oh so it doesn't help with undervoltage but only with overvoltage. Sounds quite useless then.

There are also buck converters and boost converters which don't have that problem but have other problems.  None of those will handle 50A.  They will all waste power as heat.

yeah, you'll get less voltage sag and larger capacity, if your cells are bit old i dont recommend mixing tho. They might discharge in an uneven rate. Sure theres many threads you can find to learn more about batteries

There are also sepic regulators that do boost or Buck depending on in vs out voltage. And there are for sure ones that could be used for these high currents.. They probably cost more than a whole board though.

@b264 @linsus Oh and I was wondering how I could charge these two extra batteries, because it technically is still a 6s battery, only with more capacity. Right now I have a 6s 12A BMS to charge my two 3s batteries.

if you use a BMS then the BMS will treat the parallell cells as one cell when charging. It will take longer to charge then your previous setup but it'll work. 
Just make sure you buy the same battery when expanding your pack and it should be fine. 

I sudgest doing a few trial runs where you can dissconnect the cells individually to see voltagelevels after a discharge cycle. Then connect the batteries as they're s'posed to be during charging and see if they charge evenly. If they differ alot in internal resistance you might have some missmatch.

Make a complete wiring schematic and come back to us :) safest way. 
Essentially, the wires to the BMS should be the same amount. Only more cables on the battery side to connect the parallell poles. (unless you plan to go higher in voltage)

@linsus @b264 This is the wiring scheme for as much as I know now. I didn't know what to do with the balance wires of the batteries, so that's why I left the BMS and the balance wires out.

The wiring is the same, either you charge them as two separate packs, 6S1P + 6S1P (separate balance wires). Or you parallell wire pretty much everything so they "share" balance leads. Guessing you want the later since you dont want to open it up everytime you charge.

Yes, just make sure they share the series terminal on the "3S" line in prev. picture.
Dont know what BMS you have but the chargetime will be minimum doubled with twice the capacity. 

Google around abit on how to build your own lithium packs and you can get a better understanding of how and why things are connected.Youtube is a great source as well as this forum where sevral buildthreads exist.

Can also recommend battery university

It will probably work with the wiring from your first picture. But you'll have one extra lead to your BMS since they dont share the 3S terminal. Since they'll physically be two separate packs. 
Parallell configuration also helps the cells to balance themselves, meaning they try to maintain the same voltage level when connected in parallell. The stronger one will push voltage into the weaker one simply put.

I think it would work anyway because they would end up being connected by the balance wires.  But it's better to have a higher-current connection there

Since its segments of 3S I guess it's not that important since the other cells inbetween will still be isolated. Might as well keep them separate as in your picture. The voltage test becomes even more cruicial now tho since they dont balance of eachother. Try to do half a discharge run and see what voltages you have on each.

You need to join all the balance wires from parallel cells together or havee two seperate bms/chargers.  Remember to only add these connections after a full balance charge, if the packs have significantly different voltage when you parallel them it can be very dangerous.

Only dangerous if you try to charge them before they all balance with each other.  Best safe practice is to plug all the batteries together including balance leads and then wait a couple of hours to let them all balance out prior to charging.

If one cell is at 4.2V and the other 3.2V you will probably exceed the max charging amps of the 3.2v cell and most likely start a fire.

You should never run your battery down to 3.2v lipo or li-ion.  The max percentage that you should run a battery down is about 80% of the capacity.  I found that stopping at 3.50-3.60v per cell is a rough guesstimate on the amount of battery used.  It also helps with battery longevity by not draining your batteries that low.

Not sure where that information is coming from? Pretty much any device you use lets the battery run down lower than 3.6v. 3.7v is the nominal cell voltage 3.6 is far from dead.

I have charged a couple thousand batteries over the past few years flying, racing drones.  I use and charge batteries on parallel charging boards on a daily basis.  I always put my batteries on a parallel charging board and let them sit there for a while prior to beginning the charge in order to give all he batteries the chance to balance out.  By doing so I have never had a lipo fire because I utilize go battery management.  The point i was trying to make is by hooking up the batteries together as well as the balance leads that takes the place of the parallel charging board.   I know 3.7volts is nominal I have found over the past years and charging and flying 20-30 packs a day (when I am home).  Running your batteries in particular lipo down past 3.5v on a regular basis will shorten the life span of your battery.  I'll digress because I don't want to ruffle any feathers.  I'm just here trying to give some insight.

My point is just for an inexperienced user, if you had a fully charged lipo and a fully discharged lipo according to regular values (commonly listed at 2.8-3v industry standard) and connected the two, bad things might happen. It sounds like thats not something you are ever doing. 

A few tenths of a volt is totally fine. Think about with your current limiting charger, it doesn't hit the pack with 4.2v right away most often. If it did battery damage might ensue, and no one wants damaged batteries.

Without specifying whether you're referring to li-ion or lipo, this could be slightly misleading.  These look like lipo numbers.

I made the assumption that he was using a lipo due to the 2 3s 5000mah batteries in series reference but you're both right.  It was an assumption I should have not made.  On the the other hand I monitor my battery mah charged and I have found that my example of 3.5-3.6v worked best and would account for using approximately 80% of the battery capacity thus causing my batteries to get get hundreds of charges out of them before the batteries having issues and having to remove them from service.  Like I said I wasn't trying to ruffle any feathers and I hope I didn't.

@b264 Could you make a electric scheme? Because right now it isn't very clear to me. The way I drew the balance wires was for my original 6s BMS with two LiPo's. My biggest question is mostly. Do I need to connect any balance wires of the other two batteries to the BMS? It would be very helpful if you could draw an electric scheme.

I can draw something for you after work if you like. The batteries need to share balance leads to the BMS. So there should be a connection point for the two leads from your 2packs of 0-3S(2 balance groups -> into one -> to BMS). And same for 3S-6S balance wires.

Those are cold solder joints.  Make sure the wire and the connector are both hot enough to melt the solder and you're not dripping it on like lava.

The connection that I can see on the black one looks good.

Don't strip the wire more than you need to.

Depends on your specific BMS though, and your setup.
