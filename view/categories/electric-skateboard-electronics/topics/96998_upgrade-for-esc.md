Hi, I have got boardup folding build that I've been working on. It was running the 7s2p diyeboard dual hub kit 83mm. I've just made a better battery pack with sanyo 20700 3500mah 30a cells. It's running great now but I would like a better esc/vesc. Space is really tight in the enclosure. It only just fits the diyeboard esc. What's my best option for an upgrade? Thanks in advance. Jamie

A flipsky dual 4.20 plus should fit.

Thanks, that's what I'd been looking at but wasn't sure if it was any good. I've never tried a vesc. What else do I need to buy? Just remote and transmitter? Also what's the best remote to go for?
