hi all,

got my trampa completed and its more then i could ever imagine. got it up to 30 without full throttle. way too scared to push its limits.

couple of questions. 

i have my sensor wires and motor/vesc wires all soldered up and heatshrinked. i couldn't fit enough wire loom on either the vesc side or the motor side before soldering. it's only about 3-4 inches on each side and the loom isn't malleable enough to fit 6-8 inches on one side while closing connections. any advice? such a simple problem but i can't think of a solution.

i've thought about just electrical taping motor wires together but i don't want to overheat motor/vesc/wire connections


also, can i get some input on best vesc settings for.....

12s7p
dual vesc 6
170kv aps motors

appreciate the community! picture attached.

I usually just keep scrunching it up until I can fit the whole length on one side, then put a clip or clamp of some sort on it to keep it from springing back while I plug stuff in.
