Hi,
Just a post to share pics of the inside of a Maxfind C. 

10s1p battery pack with built in charging bms, connected to all in one esc + remote receiver.

Admittedly the esc on this died in 2 days BUT they are sending a replacement.

It was cheap enough that I intend to replace with vesc and custom 10s pack over time. 

I only want a small/light/neat/cheap board where most esk8s cost Â£1000 and weigh a ton.
