Hey everyone,
this is a excerpt of my wiring. I left everything i dont need for this question.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c3cdd2261717b7be6dcadd611aecd20d1a217559.jpg" width="271" height="500">

When i charge my board i deplug the xt90 plug from the parallel adapter from the vesc [1].
Then i deplug the parallel adapter (blue filled plugs) [2]
After that i plug my dual charger in the two separate charging wires [3]

I am doing part [2] because i think it is not a good idea to have a connection (parallel adapter) between the two batteries. Am i right? Does it matter or do i am able to leave the parallel adapter plugged?
Maybe you have a better idea?

My goal is to create an easy solution for charging my board without the need to disconnect anything at all: just plug two charging cables into it and get ready for charging.

Thanks in advance
