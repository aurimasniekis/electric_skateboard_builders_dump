Probably a simple and dumb question, but I don't know how to do it. Anyway: How do I remove this clamp so I can take the cover off my motor to see whats causing smoke? I have not been able to get torque boards to help me.

You're not going to get it off without purchasing or borrowing a circlip tool.  See if an auto parts store can rent you one would be what I'd try first.  Then I'd buy one if that didn't work

If you are in a hurry a flat screw driver and a lot of patience can get it done

You can do it with needle nose pliers, but it's a bit difficult..

I have the same Motor (Torque Motor) and same need to remove the circlip. I went to Amazon to buy a plier but there are like 10 different sizes... Can one of you point me to one that will do ? Also I would like to buy a couple of other Circlips just in case. Thanks
