Hey guys,

IÂ´m new to this forum and I would like to build my own e-longboard. IÂ´m sure u read this every day , so I donÂ´t want to annoy you.

I read everywhere that the VEsc is the best ESC , but there are so many VESC out there. 
So I need your help , what is a good Vesc for a budget . I found the Maytec Vesc and also the Flipsky Vesc. Can you recommend those VEscÂ´s? 

And IÂ´m also looking for a good and cheap remote.

As usual my standard phrase: that all depends on what you want.

If you going for a beginner board or Chinese hub motors and donâ€™t mind running bldc instead of foc the 4.12 are a good budget choice. 
If you look for something more advanced than better go with a vesc 6 or focbox/ focbox unity.

I wanna go for a belt build, so I have the motor . But don't know what engine it is exactly ðŸ˜…. Does the brand matter for the esc ? Or are both okay?

I would rather go with Flipsky. They might be a bit better from what I can read here, but thatâ€™s just my guess.

I would actually go with the maytech as they seem to be a little better quality control and there motors have been generally regarded as a quality part

1 motor or 2?
what motors (size and kv)
regular board or offroad
what battery voltage 
and finally, how much torque/speed do you want
