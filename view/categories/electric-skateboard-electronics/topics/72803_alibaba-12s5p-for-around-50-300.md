So i found this battery pack on alibaba. It's a 12s5p 15000 mah pack that claims to have a 100A continious BMS. It says it uses samsung 30q cells. The funny thing? It costs between 42-58 $ 

https://m.alibaba.com/amp/product/60740842689.html?spm=a2706.amp_showroom

From pictures it looks like the 12s5p mtb pack from eskating.eu. (https://eskating.eu/product/square-12s5p-eskating-electric-mountainboard-battery-samsung-30q/) this pack is 600‚Ç¨

It seems to good to be true, of course minimal amount for a order is 10 pieces but still. 10 of these would be cheaper than one battery from eskating. What are your thoughts of this, could it be legit?

I believe eskating get theirs from Matrix.

There's an ongoing thread here:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/10s3p-samsung-30q-inr-18650-3000mah-3-6v-9-0ah/71522/17?u=brenternet

AFAIK these are ok batteries.

the eskating.eu logog on the alibaba site :sweat_smile:
it says Lifepo4 in the description...:thinking:
and different size too

Size: 200x145x75mm (7,9‚Ä≥x5,7‚Ä≥x2,95‚Ä≥)

80.0mm(T)x140.0mm(W)x160.0mm (L)

When something is too good to be true, it usually is. Buying these from a comercial bulk supplier would run you north of 200 euro. 50 euro? Sorry but I call bullshit.

Buy it for sience :slight_smile:

Meh, most things come from China at some point and there's been no reported issues with an eskating battery, bms, switch or anything of the like that I can recall.

So I'd guess these are ok. But I'd buy directly from the Matrix store.

60$ for a 12s5p pack?
you seriously think that is possible?
even a good BMS is already more....

Nope. That's why I said buy it from Matrix:

If it was possible to order a single one for 58$ i would easily do it just to find out if it works. However buying 10 of them for 580$ + shipping and import taxes seems risky üòÖ

a 12s5p for 50bucks would mean each 30q cell would be <$1.00. Yea theres no way....

these are 30Q packs?

The specs are not consistent within the page. one thing says 36v and the other says 44v. However, i'm interested in that stacking pattern, and the dimensions are right... maybe i should look into these more. Battery building is a total time suck, but was necessary.

All the flat packs from that series are listed on the same page. So if you scroll through the pictures you'll see different images matching different voltages.

30q's according to them but I only have academic knowledge of it, not bought one myself

$50 shipped for 60 cells (12s5p), that's 83 cents a cell, does that even make sense?

no it doesn't.

it's bullshit, move on.

Searched on this forum but didnt find much.
Has anyone tried the matrix batteries?  (not the ones in the OP)
Are they the same as the ones on eskating.eu?

Thanks :slight_smile:

It seems you have to buy 10 as a minimum for $290. You might get one sample for like $350. Far cry from the $50 of the thread title but that would be 99% pure snake oil. Also shipping is going to be expensive. So one piece total will be like $450

There‚Äôre some makers at alibaba that sells esk8 pack with BMS. And some of them can send batteries by ship. It takes much more longer time but the cost becomes less expensive. So I recommend to ask other shipping method and other makers. (Or search forwarder that can use ship)

This company can send by ship maybe. 
Shenzhen Sunbang Technology Co., Ltd.

(I didn‚Äôt try so there‚Äôs no insurance. And some members didn‚Äôt recommend to use chinese BMS)

edited: Oh, are you living in HK? Maybe shipping cost is a little.

So the way this works is, there is a minimum purchase of 10 pieces. Now for those 10 pieces, the price for each one is $290. If you buy 100 pieces, the price for each one is $200.

Here's the link of Shenzhen Sunbang Technology Co., Ltd.
Ask them for sample order (you'll be able to buy from one piece) or set group buy please if you feel good.
https://sunbangpower.en.alibaba.com/?spm=a2700.8443308.0.0.5b8f3e5ffkj7PG

For example:
10S4P (30Q)
Max current: 80A
36v 12.5Ah
with BMS, charging connector. 
without switch and indicator of voltage.
295usd (without shipping )

###
I'm planning to buy from them but not yet. So don't know quality etc.

they cant be the same since we build those packs in picture, in Italy (verona), you can all come visit us checking our workspace and how we build batteries.
Pure nichel, proper insulations, reinforcements for series connections, bestech bmss, detacheable switch, charge port and lcd.

Samsung 30Q from Nkon, as the 10mm 0.15 pure nichel.
