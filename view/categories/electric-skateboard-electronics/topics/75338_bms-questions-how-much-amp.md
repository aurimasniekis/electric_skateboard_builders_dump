```
so you have lipos?
You can charge them with a balance charger, so no bms needed.
you can charge them with a charge only bms.
I use a 100A fuse as back up instead of a ´bms for discharge.
if you don´t need the e-swicth on the bms than that´s an option too.
just depends on what you want and need.

yeah  Iam charging them with a balance charger atm, but its anoying to open everything and connect everything and so on. Ive got an extra module for on/off switch so I think a charge only bms would be perfect. So I dont have to look for 100A bms right? Maybe sth like that?

theoretically yes.
but still didn´t get if you use lipos or lifepo4 cells.
you wrote lipos but the linked bms is for lifepo4 cells.

I´ll go in future with a charge only bluetoothe bms.
It´s not much more expensive, but I can check each cells voltage via app and set the charge and blance volatage 0,1V under 100% full.
with it I don´t overcharge the packs when i start driving with charged packs.
