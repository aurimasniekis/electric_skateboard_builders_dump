Hi,

so i just downloaded the latest version of the VESC tool 1.09 but now i get the error "No Firmware read Response", before i got "Buffer Erase Timeout" but now i can't even connect it.

I restarted,Used a different usb port and cable, checked the COM on the Devicemanager etc.
I used version 1.08 Yesterday and it worked perfectly and haven't touched it since, only now with the Update
Not sure whats wrong.
