I'm currently using this meter on my board, what's the setting I should program the meter for a 36v Lithium ion 18650 battery pack? I was using Lipo 6s batteries before but I dont find a setting in meter for Lithium ion batteries. All help greatly appreciated, thank you.

That's a 12v tester, not what you need for esk8 since our voltages typically range from 22-44
