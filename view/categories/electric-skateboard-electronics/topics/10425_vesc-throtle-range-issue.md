So I am new to vesc's but have been riding esk8 for 2 years. I set up the vesc and even got others to help with that (thanks to all that helped), but the remote only uses 10-20% of the range. Im using a enertion 4.12 vesc, ts2g remote, zippy 3700mah 6s 35c, sk3 5055 260kv.

```
are you testing this on the bench? Current control is different than most commercial esk8 controls. It works more like a gas pedal and once the current overcomes load, it'll throttle to full speed.
