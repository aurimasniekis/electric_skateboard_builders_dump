I have a throttle controller for a scooter which is a 5v pot has a key switch and a voltmeter but following the wiring diagram the volt meter uses the ground supplied through the pot ground... the live side of the voltmeter will be 9s 37.8V so potential difference between vesc ground and adc ground has me worried... will it go bang? Or does adc share a common ground with the dc ground bus voltage? Thanks praise the hive mind.
