Does this look right?  I want to have all 5 of 2s lipos in series to get myself 10s. 

Thank you.

Thats right, just make sure your lipos have same capacity and donâ€™t forget about protection and balancing the pack

By the way my board also uses lipos in series but in different configuration![image|400x500](upload://oirbASBN3DnXUnWspb9NU0LKvK.jpeg)
