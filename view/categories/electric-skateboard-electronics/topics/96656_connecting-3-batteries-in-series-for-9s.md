Does this setup work to make a 9S battery?

Using these 2 of these harnesses:

Why do you need the top left xt60?

I was trying to make the series using the harnesses I linked (i.e. without soldering). If someone could still figure it out that would be cool, but I've decided I'll just use 10s

You could run it like you have drawn without issue as long as the wire for the adapter is a decent size.

This will work ive done it, but there will be a huge cable mess.

If you dont feel confortable soldering have you considered looking into a prebuilt Liion?

I ended up going with 2 batteries in series using a single harness for 10S but thanks for letting me know!
