Rookie mistake honestly. I was trying to solder a wire to pins 29 and 30 in an attempt to get UART working again.
Then I accidentally bridged the pins together with solder and now it is just what it is.
Just posting this here in case anyone is interested in helping me fix this.

You'll probably have to lay solder wick across it and lightly heat it, but odds are very slim you'll be able to fix it.

Probably better to send it to the Wizard @JohnnyMeduse before it's any worse, and before it's powered on

If he does the solder wick correctly I donâ€™t see why it wouldnâ€™t work? Am I wrong?

If he doesn't overheat the MCU and doesn't leave any solder balls, and is successful at getting it all off, and doesn't accidentally mess up any other place, and no solder went anywhere he can't see, then maybe

Solder wick sucks.  And I mean it sucks in more ways than one

Solderwick with some flux will solve this without overheating anything.

Depends if he has a small tip on his iron.

You need alot of flux to not bridge pins that small.

Usually if you cover the whole chip in flux and drag the iron accross the pins they will solder correctly but it does take a bit of practice. You may want to send it to the wizard to be 100%
