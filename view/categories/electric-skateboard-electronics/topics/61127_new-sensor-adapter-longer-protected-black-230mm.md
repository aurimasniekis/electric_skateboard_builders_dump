Hi guys, 
  I’ve been working with some manufacturers on some more rugged adapters and can-bus connectors. We think it’s time for longer and more protective sensor adapters as well as more affordable and available? 
We are most definitely open to feed back. 
The can-bus can come in multiple lengths
At the same price. We know space is a issue when building your board. Less wire = more space.
