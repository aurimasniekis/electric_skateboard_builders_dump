I had this problem as well when trying to configure my settings. I solved it by connecting it to my brothers computer. By some reason my own computer could not find the programming card, but my brothers could. 

So if the card doesnt work, try another computer  :slight_smile: 
I think youÂ´ll have to download the ESC software as well.
