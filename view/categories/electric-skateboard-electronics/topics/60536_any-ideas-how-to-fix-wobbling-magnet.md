As in the topic, one of the magnets is wobbling (no idea why).
Do you have any ideas how to fix it? (super-glue? :stuck_out_tongue:)![36469843_1650533611660682_187779517824106496_n|373x500](upload://6OFZhrbmVdR3MxXjEFu5kEwoUE8.jpg) 

Thanks :smiley:

Never super glue always epoxy.

Btw they sell a special epoxy for this purpose.

I suppose it has to be regular-strong epoxy, not the "metal" one, right?

Maybe a high temp epoxy would be enough, what is so special about magnet epoxy besides heat?

Iâ€™ve heard locktite 6xx has been used for this purpose before

Is JB Weld appropriate? 

I mean, thats pretty high temp stuff.

Think you cannot use anything with any added metal in the formula, it makes electrons jump the wrong way


Or something
