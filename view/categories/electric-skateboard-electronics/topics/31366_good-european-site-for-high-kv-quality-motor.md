honestly mate you dont need high kv. I have the 149 kv motor and my board is plenty fast and quite powerful as a single drive. Dont get too caught up in the numbers. Lower kv usually means higher torque and less heat which means more efficiency

190 Kv is good for a 12S, 170 Kv is also fine, just adjust your gearing accordingly. use a calculator like this one: http://calc.esk8.it/

Then you can plot in your battery cells, your motor Kv and you can check whether you can find pulleys that will adjust to your optimal topspeed :)
