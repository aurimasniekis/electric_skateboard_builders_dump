![20190305_185439|374x500](upload://1ICfnCsOOB5r1i2QXeGJeIAK1wk.jpeg) Today i installed  the new vesc tool.I ran the setup wizard and one of the VESC has a much higher resistance then the other and the current is way lower.When i try to ride it the vesc with higher current runs excellent but the one with higher resistance makes noise and doesn't want to spin.Can someone help me!!
