Hi,

I’ve got 2 Turnigy D5035, and in both when I connect the sensors, the VESC doesn’t boot (is unresponsive). 

What can it be?

Thanks guys

I think that your sensor wires have to be in the same order as the phase wires, and also make sure the Vesc plug has the same pinout as the sensor cable

Interesting, the motor phase wires are all the same color, how I can know which one is which? I've to just guess trying? 

Thanks so much, mate!

Just try switching around the phase leads. What esc do you have?
