Ok this maybe a repeat but....

I picked up a 5065 270kv Sensored motor....I'm gonna get a 120a sensored esc....

Now do I just need to plug in the sensor cable into the esc and plug the matching color  phase wires with alike colors on the esc? 

Can I fuck this up? Lol 

Your Two cents would be awesome

No, there is no guarantee the colors are matching together. If you're going to use VESC it doesn't matter, else you maybe have to do these steps:

Not using a VESC

Then you maybe have to follow the ''else step''. I would use a 3-5A fuse or a current limiting power supply while doing this.
