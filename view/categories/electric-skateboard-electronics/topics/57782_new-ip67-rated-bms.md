Hello friends,

As most of you may have read my posts, you might know I am a fan of:

- Micro BMS (small footprint)
- Charge Only
- properly insulated to not short on anything(foam padded or wrapped etc)

So what is changing? I recently for the first time got stuck in a down pour. My Enclosure was sealed properly and no issues there, but alas it opened my eyes to diving further into, more protection for complete prevention

One if the biggest killers for people isn't water, but road dust. I have ordered one of each 10s/12s/13s version of these BMS to test. Would love to hear others input if they have used these? If not I am super excited to try these.

Looking forward to this, as well as possibly experiementing with potting Bluetooth modules and receivers in silicone.

Your thoughts below :)

Not for esk8 specifically, but I find some conformal coating on PCBs is all I need for very good water, dust, scratching resistance on bare parts. The current on these units seems small, has anyone tried coating a normal BMS?

Charge only

Anyways yes conformal coating does work. But it is an extra step and requires multiple coatings to truely be water proof. For 28 bucks and already potted they seem like a steal...?

That's what I am going to try to find out. 

I ordered one extra 10s specifically to throw old laptop cells together in a 10s1p configuration. As I plan on fish bowling the BMS like the pictures. It will either be a spectacular win. Or a nice firework show in an ammo container.

I've used this...currently opening a dispute case for return. Doesn't charge your battery pack fully. It cuts current once a cell/cell group reaches 4.2V. I'd recommend staying away.

The specs are the same as most BMS. I'm betting his battery has a dropped cell, or a damaged parallel pack with different IR. And the voltage of one of the series is out of balancing range.

Make sure you toss some salt and sand in the water because all the water that gets in mine is salty and gritty from the snow treatments on the roads.

This is funny.  I got a bundle of batteries and some other random stuff from @bimmer.

It had 2 10s BMSs.  I hadn't looked into them much, but wouldn't you know it:

Not completely. Once a cell group reaches 4.2v it stops charging the pack, leaving other groups unbalanced

Thats how every cheaper BMS works, main pack voltage reaches 4.2 * cell count it cuts off the curent :) They don't have any smart cell checking like @JTAG bms has :)

EDIT: it can also be your power supply aka charger...
EDIT2: Those BMS has standalone cell balancers which don't know nothing apart if cell voltage is over its threshold (4.2V) it turns on mosfets to dumb the energy (balance)
```

## \#22 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-06-11T22:07:59.110Z Reads: 243

```
Not necessarily. Regular BMS work off of resistance. Of the cell beside it. If the difference threshold is to great(which translates to voltage difference) the cell will not be balanced.

So packs with 10 series cells and 9 of them get to 4.20 and the last one is greater than .1v difference(ie is resting at 4.09) likely will not be balanced. This is a safety feature as most healthy packs that have not been over discharged, should naturally hold a very close balance. 

If your pack isn't holding a close balance with less then 0.1v variation. Then something is wrong with your pack. 

Balance circuits are pretty simple, and designed not to balance an unhealthy pack. Just the nature of rudimentary bms

Yeah those numbers never made sense to me either. Just buy thecharger you need for a full 8s which is 4.2x8. 
When I check their specs it says 54.6 for my 13s for full charge. My guess the number is for lipo cells another type other than lithium ion cells. 
Don’t worry, I’m going to use mine as 12s even which is possible.
The way these work is whichever many are in series will be the charge voltage you need. 

Nominal charge for lipo is 3.7. That times 8 gives you your 29 and a bit. So these numbers they mention are the nominal charge voltages for lipo.

and can't i use a 24 volt charger? those are a lot more easy to find

If you are using lithium ion cells with a nominal charge of 3.6 volts than no you will need a charger that charges to 33.6 volts or they will never fully charge. 

Forget what the bms says. Your cells tell you charge me full to 4.2 volts each.

About to ask the same thing.  Why have all three?  If one is in my collection, which one should I go with? 

I normally use some natural cure silicone for a similar purpose, but these lighter brush ons seem much better

They all have different purposes.

The acrylic is thin and watery and gets in tight places very well, and makes a mess easily.

The silicone is higher temperature and thicker but thermally insulates more

The polyurethane is the thickest and makes a good substitute for wire insulation or something you will grab with your hands, like a loop key, or to put on top of a piece that rubs against another piece to physically space them apart.

A heatsink needs only a single coat of acrylic or it won't be able to dissipate heat well.

Three 10AWG wires soldered together in a Y needs about 5 - 10 coats of polyurethane conformal coating, which is almost like you never cut the insulation off the wires in the first place.

I like coating circuit boards with acrylic in the hard to reach places, then finishing them with silicone.

They all glow under UV, so you can use a blacklight to check that you didn't miss any places.

[quote="Sender, post:40, topic:57782"]

[/quote]

If you only get one, get acrylic.  If you get two, get acrylic and silicone.  If you get all three, the polyurethane one is rather useful....
... and if you get zero, steal some clear nail polish from your sister/wife/girlfriend/mom/grandma and use that... maybe mix a tiny bit of acetone in it to thin it down first...

[quote="Sender, post:40, topic:57782"]

They are a lot better.  Also remember to use multiple coats - don't be afraid to use more than 2 coats.

I got one of these little red fuckers, 13s. It's nice and tiny, but the connector is JST-PH. Lol now I'm in a hole deciding on whether to buy 14 pin PH housings and sockets, putting XH on the pack and making an adapter, reusing the housing on the wire that came with the bms with my own wiring and crimped terminals (the included is of course too short), or splicing a bunch of stuff.

I hated working with JST-PH for the vesc, so tiny and fiddly and the wires in the gauges that fit the crimp terminals break so easily.

And I have a bunch of charging/measuring stuff that's all XH.

The BMS doesn't usually let you know when a charge is complete, that's typically the role of an LED on the charger itself.
