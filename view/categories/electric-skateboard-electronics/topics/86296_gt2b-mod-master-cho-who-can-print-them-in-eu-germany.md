Hello, I´m trying to get the Master Cho mod somewhere, but can´t find it anymore. The 3D printing services charge quiete a lot of money. I guess PLA is not the right material, but it´s the only affordable one for around 20€. Is anyone kind in EU or propably Germany (to keep the shipping cost down) with a 3D printer to print the enclosure with the right materials for me. Of cause I will pay for it. I have the .stl files. Would be very appretiated.

Thats what I found about the printing settings. I have no glue, but a specialist will know what it means :slight_smile: 

Print Settings

**Printer Brand:**
Ultimaker

**Printer:**
Ultimaker 2

**Rafts:**
No

**Supports:**
Yes

**Infill:**
100%

**Filament:** 
CarbonX Carbon fiber filaments

**Notes:**
I use CarbonX filaments, it prints well without warping.

Printed with carbon fiber (15%) reinforced ABS 3D printing filament, which is 3 mm. (3/32 inch) thick and is very sturdy and rigid.

PLA works fine for a remote, it's just very likly that you will shatter it in a thousand pieces when you smash it on the ground on a fall (because it's so brittle). But PLA objects actually have a nice "solid" feeling that I like because it beeing stiff and brittle instead of tough and flexible.

The fibers in the ABS trade off a bit of the flexible properties of ABS for rigidity, texture, look and buzz words apperently (fiber infused plastics are often a bit weaker in pressure and tention tests). Because non continious fibers don't relly give strength, but more rigid parts (also a higher crack resistance) impling a more robust object for most people. 

It's a bit like comparing carbon and glass fibers, most people think carbon has more strength in any regard, but in reallity a good quality glass fiber is on paar or even stronger. The parts made from glass will be more flexible than carbon parts because the material glass has a higher elongation but it is actually stonger or tougher (will break at a higher load) than carbon (carbon takes lead in stiffness and maybe has a higher strength to weight ratio) . 

Back on topic for a remote possible 3Dprint materials: PLA, ABS, PETG, ASA, PC, PP, Nylon, PS(HIPS), (TPE/TPU) and POM (Acetal) so basicly anything, the load and temperatures in a remote should be low enough in normal use for basicly any 3d Print material.

So why not using the cheapest option? Because of their properties in case of an impact, will you just smash it and get a new one, should it survive small crashes or should the cas ing itself be basicly indestructable but the electronics may not survive it.

**PLA definitely is in the "get a new one if you crash" category but** is also very cost effective to print espacially if you can print them by yourself.
**PETG is similar but will survive drops and very light crashes** most likely.
**ABS, HIPS, ASA are another category they are less prone to break on smaller impacts**, HIPS is the least "toughest" of these three but is also very stiff. ABS and ASA are basicly the same, they are good all kind of situation materials. Good impact resistance, good strength, good filament prices but not as easy to print compared to PLA (HIPS and ASA are also not very common materials) 

**PC, POM and Nylon are pretty much kings when it comes to impact resistance and toughness**, but they have their downsides PC is hard to print, not many hobbists can/do print it, you can't get many colors on the market and they are not as easy to paint. You also have to be carefull with some organic solvents acetone for example can make it crack and brittle (light isopropanol/water solutions are fine). POM is even worse to FDM print, basicly not possible with hobby grade stuff, I have a roll to tinker with but don't got useable prints yet.  Nylon is expensive, needs to be stored in a dry area, can be dyed in many colors but also decolors pretty fast by greases (hands and oils) and UV light. It can also change it's properties by moisture content and gets a bit softer when wet (drying/storing in a dry area can fix that.

**TPE/TPU and PP are very special (PP is over all even more situational, cuz it's weaker but very chemical resistant) they are likely to soft and flexible for a remote by themself**, but may actually the solution to handheld devices and casings when someone designs/modifies multi material designed cases for them, together with a stiff strong shell to support the electronics as a envelope they might be the best way to go. The flexibles are pretty much indestructable, have a very high abrasion resistance and overall have a nice grippy feel.

**Conclusion:**
You can use basicly any 3D print material for a remote it will work, but to get a robust remote in the long run I would pick at least PETG. ABS is maybe even prefered, fiber filled or not. If you take a fiber filled material it will feel stiffer but they are also more expensive.
The best material for a remote shell in my opinion is PC or a PC/ABS blend (these are also available you get very strong and impact resistant material that is stronger than ABS and easier to print than PC alone). ABS is also fine and more available (cheaper).

I will offer a 3D print service in the future for the forum (Germany priced basicly to cover the costs and nothing else), I have and used a printer for quiete a while now.  It is currentlz not available because my controller is modified to work with a DIYed CNC portal router in my basement. I got my new controller for the printer in the mail today, but I'm not confident to get it running before the end of the month (I'm on vacation the next two weeks)
