Unfortunately I can't comment yet :frowning: I had some trouble with another component of the build so it's not ready to go yet. I'm going to try a run on Saturday with single drive and see how it goes.

170kv 16/40 pulleys 97mm flywheels. Weighted showed 24-26mph I think. I can look later after work or you can plug those specs into the esk8 calc. I weight 210 lbs and probably carry an extra 15lb for safety gear, phone and some tools... I use 12wh per km to be conservative.

12S 4P Samsung INR18650-25Rs baby. 80amps continuous. 10Ah, 430 watt hours. 25 mile range, 35mph+ top end. 

and the price is sooooo right on those cells for the quality and performance they provide. ITs kind of a no brainer.

Just ordered an 8s14p pack Tesla (panasonic) cells.  I couldn't find anything else that had the energy/power density

at 14p you could use any cell you want with a decent discharge! cant wait to see that

Well I need 220+ amps and many cells don't really do so well under load (actual wh at a given amp draw) plus I like how robust the tesla cells are to deep discharge etc.  Might look into those IMR that lhb mentioned above.  Got a 14s14p in CAD that I need to pick cells for

Not exactly I just need a lot of watts and am really inefficient with it.  I'll post a build when the parts come in
