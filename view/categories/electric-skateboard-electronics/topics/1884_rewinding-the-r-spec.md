So, time to start rewinding the motor that shorted out.

Removing the stator was pretty straightforward, putting it in the freezer for an hour with a wet piece of paper inside the bearing tube and then hammering it out.
But this thing did *not* want to part with it's old widning, took quite a bit of effort to remove it all.

After a lot of pulling and tearing I managed to get it all off.

Around 100 grams of copper in it. 20 strands of 29AWG per phase.

Now to figure out what wire to use.
Thinking of using 3 or 4 strands of thicker wire.

If you change wire - you will change motor KV.
Go with same wire as it was in motor.

Doing multistrand is a pain. You have to pair all the long wires before winding.  I bet you could find an equivalent cross-sectional area that would still be windable with one wire.   I've got 22 gauge and it's still very pliable.  

I gave up winding my motors because it was very hard to access with the stator permenantly stuck on and found I kept making shorts with the necessary roughness of getting it on.  I did learn some things though..  and I found an LC meter for measuring the inductance was really helpful in seeing if there were shorts and also how good a winding I was doing.  (A multimeter's resistance measurements were not accurate enough for such small resistance and a short wouldn't show!) I found if I rushed and ended up with a messy tooth it had much less inductance than consistent loops.  You want to end up with them all consistent as well of course. 
30 bucks with shipping on eBay! 

I spent at least 10 hours unwinding and winding all included...take your time or else it's a shorting nightmare. 

As I wrote the LRK wind makes it much easier.

Don't try to just put everything deep inside or it will eventually collapse and you won't get much in.  Try to wind the tooth itself from front to back and back to front.  Everytime I ended up with space available but I couldn't get the wire through the shrinking slot between the teeth.

Use a small wooden dowel to push stuff down.  Even a destroyed pencil worked for me. 

I really wanted to succeed at this myself.  I have a lot more respect for the winders of these motors.  It takes time


***when u say "20 strands" do you mean 20 small wires, as that would be the nomenclature, or do you mean 20 turns around each tooth?  U need to redo the turns around the tooth the same to redo the same kv.  Someone above said otherwise.  So 20 turns with 8 thin strands or 20 turns with one thick one is the same kv

14 turns per tooth with 20 stands in parallel, so winding it LRK instead of DLRK as it was from factory I'll have to do 28 turns per tooth.

Might do single strand, gonna do some testwinds with similarly thick wire before I commit to anything.

Been reading up on how to do it for the last week.

@Iceni @Hummie I've long wondered whether it is worth it to rewind a failed motor. It sounds like a time consuming and difficult process. Does the cost of the copper wired plus all the time end up being worth a repaired motor at the size\cost that we all use? Does it turn out better than it comes from the factory, more performance-tuned?

Normally it's not that hard. I just screwed it up repeatedly and it's hard to access my stator with the non-removable aluminum wall beside it.  

Taking off the windings takes longer than putting them on for me. And then u can screw up the winding pattern..did that too. ***take note of the starts and ends and clockwise vs counter***. And then after finding repeated shorts I gave up. 

With the LRK wind terminated delta it's likely much easier to rewind than any other wind and this pic is the best explanation I've found.  The LRK is a great torque wind to, the longer the stator the better. Some of the diagrams are missing info.  Once you visualize it in your head it's a simple wind really. Each strand does a clockwise and a counter clockwise opposite itself.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/19bbfd9b35a24043c14d14e49683fded641d423c.png" width="281" height="499">

If u do a rewind ur likely to have a much better motor.  It's all about getting neat windings for inductance and better copper fill.  The thicker the wire generally the better too although that's a bit controversial and sometimes it's easier to fit thinner wires. 

Would've been cool if lceni had been able to test it before and after the rewind

I really like the idea of doing it...just haven't succeeded yet!  Respect to whoever is doing them for me

I'm gonna run some tests side-by-side with the other motor i have, so ill have something to gauge the performance when finished.

@treenutter It is a pretty time consuming task to do it, but the copper is about 1/10th the price of a new motor, so it's not that expensive on the material end.
I do it in my spare time in front of the TV so, no lost time there really ;)

So after a bit of testing with different wires i first settled on two strands of 0.95mm thick wires, was a pain in the ass to get it to lay neatly, but i managed to get it fairly nice.

Only problem was i managed to kinda ruin it when putting it all back together, scraped off the insulation at the base of it, oops >>

Then i thought, screw multistrand and ordered some 1.45mm thick wire and did single strand wind, that was a heck of a lot easier.
And looks about a gajillion times better.

Though with that winding it ended up with 11 turns per tooth instead of the stock 14, so it's a little faster.
According to a turncalculator i found it should theoretically end up at 250-ish Kv.
Gotta make some comparisons to the other motor i have that's still got it's original winding.

The interesting thing is there's 20 grams more copper in it now than it's stock counterpart.

Beautiful winding.  Nice job. Probably will perform much better.  Too late now I guess but it looks like u could've squeezed in another wind or two. Maybe glue it down.

Could propably have one more turn every other tooth, but couldn't be bothered, wouldn't have made a huge difference in kv.

What kind of glue would you recommend?
Would regular CA glue work?

Ca glue will eat the enamel off the windings!  I've seen it. 
I use stycast by loctite but it's a pain.  I'm looking for a good drip "conformal" coating.  I'm not sure what's acceptable though and if an epoxy is high enough heat and a similar thermal expansion as the windings I think it's ok but don't know and they probably use special stuff for a reason.  If u search conformal coating ull find something. 
The magnets in the motor are probably standard and not high heat and only good to 80c anyway so u don't need the resin to get too hot.

Hmm, interesting, i though ca was inert once it cured, good thing i didn't put it on then.
Will see if i can find some epoxy that's rated higher than the general type i see everywhere, the enamel on the wires i used is rated for 200'c so might wanna match that just keep it overengineered, just in case.
Though if the motor ever reach 200'c I'd guess something is very very wrong :stuck_out_tongue:


I'll open it up tomorrow and check the stator, already put all the tools away for the night.

In a way it's better to have a low temp wire if u have regular low temp magnets otherwise u can cook the magnets and really ruin the motor as Rewinding will be pointless.

I was just looking up ca glue and magnet wire. Some people use it. Some people say it will eat it.  It ate mine.  Think it depends on which enamel the wires use

This gives me hope for my R-SPEC 245 i have from a while ago, as well as another R-SPEC 190 i have with bad windings. 

So when you're done winding and have the winding leads left hanging out there, how do you re-attach the main leads that will plug into the ESC?  just solder them together and heat shrink over it?
```

## \#22 Posted by: Iceni Posted at: 2016-04-13T19:26:58.949Z Reads: 214

Pretty much.
I even put some small heatshrink over the strands from where they exit the coils all the way to where i soldered them to the main leads.
Just to eliminate the problem that the lead to the rewind in the first place.

I'd give you a picture of how it looks, but unfortunatly i used a crappy screw to lock the stator to the bearing tube which broke when i screwed it in, so it's currently permanently locked in place until i can drill it out. :P

The winding scheme hummie linked is LRK, where you only wind every other tooth and the others are left empty.
I used a dLRK wind where all 12 teeth are wound.

This is the schematic i used:

The winding "magnet wire" is insulated though so u should burn the ends or even scrape them or use some kind of liquid remover to clean it off and then solder.  It probably largely comes off soldering but it's the typical practice.

Didn't want to create new thread so problem is loose winding. 

Just got my new r-specs and both of them have few loose coil. Should I put some epox on the outer side of stator where loose windings are or maybe return these? I'm from Finland so returnig is little expensive.

That shouldn't really be a problem, but if you want to be on the safe side, get some heat resistant epoxy and put a little over the loose strand.
Couldn't hurt.

But something I'd recommend is to put some heatshrink over the phasewires where they coil around inside the can to avoid the same problem me and a few others have had with the insulation rubbing off and shorting out the motor.
Might be quite tricky to do though without pulling out the stator a bit, and that's a whole project in itself.

Yea I think I have to do that. I've got some 100 celsius resistant 2 comp epox. 

It's wieird that one motor is perfect but the other... couple of loose winding, motor wires stick out differrnt ways, one wire will be shorting soon due to scrubing and keyway is bad (had to file).

Hellooo guys. Just found this old thread, was basically just about to make a new one. Got an Rspec 6355, riding with it since last year but now it's borked because of pebbles getting in the motor and crushing the windings... !!

I thought about this before but i have not really seen any threads about rocks or pebbles in the motor so i assumed it wasn't really any issue. Or maybe it's usually not but i was being sort of extreme riding around here as soon as the ice on the roads cleared after the swedish winter... We use alot of sand and gravel to keep people from slipping in the winter so.... now i know that up to about an inch of gravel, you can still ride, two inches you can still plunge through if you brace for impact! xD

It's actually really funny and exhilarating ride, skidding along. 

But now i probably need to rewind my motor, i have sent a guarantee ticket but i'm not really expecting them to cover this... i mean it's really not their fault, if it where my company i might cover it if it was super rare, one in a thousand, just to get good reviews. But i'm not counting on it.

So what wire is recommended? I'm looking to reduce the kV a bit, aiming for 170-180 as the single drive is a little too much for my vesc in this hilly area, overheats just before the top of some hills!

Based of this thread, is the 190 kv Rspec originally 14 turns? would i need 15 or 16 to be close to 170 kv? Guessing 1.2 wire might be good?

I have not had any temp issues in the rspec before the shorts so i'm guessing i can get away with some rookie mistakes in the winding.. such as less copper in it. But also i have now printed a protective cover so, it will probably run hotter with that mounted!

If u do even a half decent winding with a single copper wire you'll likely have less resistance to inductance than before and a cooler motor.  figuring what size wire will fit with those turns there's a calculator u can use if u add a couple stator dimensions.

Hmmm alright thanks Hummie. That is encouraging, it is quite daunting to rip up the motor like this. I'll place an order for some 1.2-1.3 diameter wire nad hope that will be a good fit for 15/16 turns. Will be interesting to run some 50 amps through that, i won't believe it'll work until i see it but the motor did take that on before without problems so, i'll be putting back a similar amount of copper sooo... But in any other application you'd never use that thin wire, more lika 8mm2! haha.

According to the calc i will get 177 kV for 15 turns or 166 for 16. Both should probably be ok. Or maybe even lower and i'll add some more cells in series, we'll se how the winding goes. 

About the winding, would the dLRK Iceni linked be the stock one? The LRK looks way simple but i mean, if i get it correctly then i will have to put 30 windings on every other tooth!? 

That would though be 2x times the dLRK wind so that sort of makes sense. Will it still have the same number of steps only using half the teeth/magnets? It just feels wrong but, yeah hummie i just read through the hubmotor thread (that devin... heh! :D) , you seem to know your stuff.

I forget the gauge now.  But doing every other tooth in my mind is much easier and likely would get more copper on because since we're not amazing pros getting jammed up is inevitable.

If you terminate it wye it'll drop the kv almost half. Maybe that's how @Iceni got to so low 250kv with such fat wire 1.45.  

I probably said it in here somewherebut maybe not, If u can get the stock motor onto a vesc to get the resistance and inductance numbers from the tests and compare that would be really nice to see.  
This 15$ inductance meter is pretty awesome to use winding.

@petter
With 1.45mm wire I think i managed to get 12.5 turns on, which turned out to approx 240kv in delta.
If I would change to wye it drops to 140-ish.
All theoretical though, used a turn calculator to get the values.
But the speed tests seems to indicate it's fairly accurate.

Edit: 1.45mm is with the enamel, the copper is 1.4mm.

So to get around 170 you could go two ways, use even fatter wire and less turns in wye or a little thinner for more turns in delta.

I found that dlrk was easier to manage, with lrk you need to double the turns on the teeth you use which can get messy.
And the inner ocd in me couldn't stand leaving teeth open :p

Haha yeah I feel with your OCD there! In fact, i might have to do this with my eyes closed so i don't fret too much about it!

I don't quite like the wye, i tried re-terminating two previous motors and while they still worked they didnt quite feel as solid after. But i might be imagining that, breaking them open and messing about not quite knowing what i was doing, hehe. But i think i'll go for the delta wind in LRK. 

One thought i got is, LRK should build more height than dLRK! Winding the same tooth twice as much should be OK in the slot, but we'll see about the top/bottom.

@Hummie, Is that the inductance meter you're using? I've seen that before and thought it seemed nice, does caps also right? Then i might get one, now that i've actually got a use case for it :D

The only Rspec i have right now is pretty much dickered, but i do have a vesc and i can get the values from there. I'll also post the new post-wind values. Hopefully the values in the vesc now are from a better point in the motors life, should be at least a month old and, i have not paid super attention to them but i've redone the test in BLDC tool a few times, trying to optimize and i don't remember them differing much.

Edit: Haha! I was just looking for a good magnet wire and then got a pic that was actually accurate and where you could see the scale! 1.2 mm wire is fucking fat man! even though in small for the current.. @Iceni, did you have any problems with the enamel breaking off bending such thick wire?

Here I am giving basic advice and you're steps beyond me.  
I don't think the extra wire on the top and bottom with lrk would hit anything and you've got a lot of room in a typical outrunner

Haha! I just ordered from electrokit aswell! But the 1.2 mm wire. Also i got two of them since they were 100 grams each and you stated 100 grams copper + 20 more after winding. And I'll probably mess up/redo some part so some extra will be nice. I'm in sweden(örnsköldsvik), guessing you are to? 

@Hummie, haha well not really!  I really appreciate both of your inputs, i do a lot of electronics and tinkering but motor/transformer winding still feels like some sort of black magic. The Rspec actually has more room than the other NTM motors i looked at. 

I ordered a LC meter on ebay so i'll measure with that when i get it. Or actually i got two, one generic one for transistors and stuff but the inductor range on that one was something like 1mH - 20 H, ridiculously high so i got a 'high precision' LC one also that supposedly does 1nH - 20 H. Almost the same as yours i think but the buttons and input are in another order(the oddities of cut-throat manufacturing in china)

Will be posting the values from vesc and some pictures during the week while waiting for my orders!

Haha! Yeah right, looking forward to that! Actually i painted on some laquer on the windings aswell(and cleaning up loose strands) in a desparate attempt to get another few weeks of use from it, so it would last until a replacement arrived. 

Didn't work, needless to say.

But with it just being thin copper strands, elbowgrease should do the trick. 

But now i'm actually having real problems with removing the stator. Tried both heating and freezing it, but no luck hammering it loose. Do you or anyone else have some extra tips/tricks? 

Trying to be gentle with it but i'll probably break something if it doesnt budge soon! Hah!

After having it in the freezer for maybe an hour I used a bit for a socket wrench with the same size as the bearing tube and just took a hammer and whacked it hard until I loosened.

Like this one, don't remember the exact size i used though:

Will take some force to break the bond, but once it has moved a little it gets easier.

Guess I just need a bigger hammer then. I was using a bolt with a washer in the right size, but using a socket might be somewhat better as well.

We will see over the weekend, it'll be a make-or-break!

You'll want to use a glove to get a better grip on the stator as well so it won't slip in the hand so much.

Oh my fucking lord! I finally got it loose. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/0/50f173f8884e1847c270038f8e5398e26bbb73ef.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I mean, im no pro but damn! That took some serious grunt.
I even went out and bought a bigger hammer:

Still hade to use alot of force to get it to start moving.

Didnt use a socket but a socket spanner that almost was a tight fit.

Clearly it was glued. I did heat it to maybe 200 or 150c, but maybe that wasnt enough? Hard to estimate the actual temp aswell, maybe putting it in the oven for an hour at 300c is better.

But! FUCK YES.
Now i understand what you were saying about the wires though... Both ends of the winds start from the inside, covered by the other winds!? How död they make this? 
Worst case i'll use the hack saw on one side of the stator. 

The story shall continue!

U may want to hack at it but if ur not careful u could unpeal some of the coating on one of the laminations likely on a corner and later could have an easy scrap on the rewinding and a short.  Recoating the stator is a pain and ud lose room that could be copper

Yeah, i thougth about that and i didnt really need to use a saw. Sidecutters and pliers and some blisters did the trick instead. Spent about 6½ h removing all the winds.
Amazed at how much they stuck together, if i cut a wind at both sides i would get basically a small block of Cooper. The winds were very tangled in each other, even the last one, all clear around and i still couldnt unwind it.

Got some dents in the stator coating from bendng/pulling with the pliers, a bit careless but probably OK. The centers for the winds all have intact coatings on all corners.

Well i tried to do the LRK wind but then saw that it will not fit. There is only round 4-5 mm from the top of the stator to the arms of the magnet bell, my windings ended up something like 6 mm. There is more room under the stator at around 12 mm. Might be possible but hell no for me, the first 15 laps were the easiest anyway!

The first 20something laps i got pretty nice but then i just could not keep it very neat any more. Will try the dlrk instead.

Bummer. Maybe u could just flatten the top to 4-5mm somehow and it'd work.

Was worth a try though!
oh yea, make sure you have enough slack on the wires crossing the center gap when going from one side to the other, if they cross too close to the hole they'll get jammed between the stator and the end piece when you press them together again.

Yeah maybe, or if someone with some winding skills did it they could minimize the height and spread it out some more.. But tio much of a gamble for me.

Yeah i had some slack there though it's not really showing.
