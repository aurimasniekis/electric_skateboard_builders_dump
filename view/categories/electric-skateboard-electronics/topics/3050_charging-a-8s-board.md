Hello guys, I recently finished my board and I realized the hassle of taking out the batteries each time. I was wondering if I could use the charger I already have http://www.amazon.com/SkyRC-100-240V-Balance-Charger-Input/dp/B01B6990GI and buy these connectors http://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Female-Connector-Adapter-Laptop/dp/B00EZDO400 and the male end and solder it up so that I could plug my board in instead of opening it up all the time.

You cannot just buy the connectors and expect to work like plug and play. You will need to have at least 9 pins XLR cable connectors. So you can balance each cell properly.

Could I solder in the plugs like this? All the components would be in he box. I already have the balance cable and I would still plug it into the charger.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a21f6f8b7dd2f54607c1a20e840fab31d283ee2f.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Yes thats possible, but you still need to plug in your balance connector to the balance charger.

Absolutely. Although most people here would use a twin charger connectors, but tapping like that would also work just fine.

Thanks for the help! I will definitely be doing this and then maybe I can upgrade to a better compartment ðŸ˜Š

I have seen people use a VGA port for all in one charging so just one connector can balance and charge your battery instead of the traditional way of having a balance lead and a connector.
