So although the store page for [this ESC] (http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__17234__Hobby_King_80A_Sensored_Sensorless_Car_ESC_1_8_1_5_.html) says a max of 4s, according to [this teardown](http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/?p=1586) it looks like it can handle 6s. I might have to pick it up and do some stress testing on it :slight_smile:

That was a good write up. I say, "do it". See what happens. For science. I still have one of the 150A HK ESC in a board. Still going strong!

i wouldn't bother on 6s.....there must be some reason it's not rated at high

I have used a lot of those in the 150A version. They are pretty good.
But i would be cautious about using 80A version. I just dont think  it will handle the current.

Could anyone please tell me if I can use this instead of a VESC?
