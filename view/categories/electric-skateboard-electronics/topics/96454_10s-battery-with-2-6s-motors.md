Hello guys,
I'm kind off new to electric skateboards.
My question was can I use 2 Turnigy 5000mah 5s 20c in series for 2 6s motors 195kv from hobbyking?

I will use the 10s ESC from Mboards.

You can, it might break though. Question is why would you?

Because that's what I had laying around. I read another topic with someone who said it would be fine but I wanted to be sure so it wouldn't break my motors.
