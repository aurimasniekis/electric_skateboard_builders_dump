I was wondering if anyone knew how the Enertion IOS App is coming along. Is it still in the works or is it canceled? Jason said they were in the process of making one for IOS, but I haven't heard about the project in a while. If anyone who works for or with Enertion knows, like @onloop (do you work with them?), that would be great!

On IOS the app would have to be sideloaded. Iâ€™ll get it into the appstore hopefully before units ship, if not it will be available as a .apk download, a .exe download and a mac and ubuntu version as well if I can get that sorted in time.
