The other night i downloaded the Geek app to my iPhone because it claimed it could save me tons of money on geeky things and from what i can see the markdown is pretty real, even compared to Amazon. 

Just now i was able to order Red LED volt meters just like the blue ones that came with Enertion's original 10Ah kit for $1 each. I got 5 so i'd have some extras. They also have them in blue if you like slightly slower colors. Amazon had the same ones listed at round $2.50. The shipping was only a buck in Geek. 

Then I found electronic key switched for $3 each. They're designed to fit in an 11mm hole, as the thread diameter is listed at 10.9mm. 

I don't normally endorse apps, but these sales on detail parts are good. They also have a lot of tools, heat shrink tubing, and other things that might come in handy for eboard building.

I would download that app, but I am a part of the #BlackBerryMasterRace, so I don't think it would work...

Jokes aside, that app sounds pretty sweet, and I do actually own a blackberry...

i'm not sure if there are any shipping restrictions. I'm assuming they ship worldwide. 

Also i believe the app is most likely cross platform, meaning there's probably and android/BB version. If not their mobile site probably works fine on a Blackberry.

the key switches were total shit. However, it was just those particular ones that were shit. I've seen much better ones and i'm still not against the idea of a key switch on an esk8, as long as the key can still be removed when powered on, or at least has a small enough nub not to matter if its still in the lock. 

the red LED displays never showed up, i ended up getting them from ebay and i've been using those ever since.
