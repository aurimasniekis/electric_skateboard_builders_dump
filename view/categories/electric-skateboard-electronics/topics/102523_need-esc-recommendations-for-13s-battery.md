I have a 13S6P battery that ive been using with dual 6374 170KV motors. I have gone through two FlipSky 4.20 dual VESC's set to a limit of 60000 ERPM. I dont know what part of the board is toast, but im looking for recommendations on a solid ESC that would be able to handle this setup and more.

People are having success with unity but it is pushing the line... Vesc maker x is up and coming i believe that can handle higher voltages iirc

People I know running 13s are using focboxes. Not a unity.  A focbox.
