I’ve been trying to understand what the bars with the little plus sign mean on my Graupner Ultramat 18 charger. This is the screen where I check the individual charges of each cell. An example is given below:

The manual doesn’t explain it at all. Can anyone help me out here?

have a look on youtube.
i looked through some videos and that + seems to be normal.
maybe it´s just the sighn that its ready for charging or not fully charged.
did you check if the + goes away when the lipo is charged up to 4.2V?

Did a little search and found nothing. Show us voltage of other cells so we have more info to guess what it is? Also what's the charger doing when you took the picture?


3.6v is about 50% so maybe that's what it is?

It happens differently at different times. I've uploaded some more examples.

Seems like the ones at desired voltage 4.16v doesn't have the plus. So plus is balancing?

I think it must have something to do with the balancing. I took the batteries to storage charge last night and when it was complete all cells bar 2 had the little pluses at the end of the bars. 

I'm going to check with Graupner and will post the response.
