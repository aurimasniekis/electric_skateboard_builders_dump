Hi everyone,

I'm doing my first [build](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/expert-review-needed/27795/8) and I'm at the point of ordering my motors, vesc's and batteries. But before I'll do my orders I want to be sure I get a combination that gives a reliable and useable board.

I made the following calculation:

And I want to order these parts:

* [2x TTurnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-213kv Brushless Outrunner Motor (€60,26 per motor)](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-213kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?___store=en_us)

* [2x FOCBOX Motor Controller ( €150.77 per vesc)](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/vesc-x-programmable-brushless-motor-controller/)

* [2x ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 5S1P 20C (2 packs wired to 10S, €38.15 per pack)](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-5s1p-20c.html?___store=en_us)

* [HobbyKing® ™HK-GT2B 3CH 2.4GHz Transmitter and Receiver w/Rechargable Li-ion Battery (€20.45)](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tmhk-gt2b-3ch-2-4ghz-transmitter-and-receiver-w-rechargable-li-ion-battery-1.html?___store=en_us)

I'm looking for a top speed of about 30 - 35 km/h (my weight is about 70 kg). I'm not planning to use this board on offroad terrain, mainly regular roads or light gravel roads. Should i get by with this setup?

In your calculation you use a 213kv motor. But in your shopping list you have these: [quote="D3rax, post:1, topic:29120"] SK3 - 6374-149kv [/quote]
You might need to do your math again?
Are you planning to use a Trampa eMTB, I ask just because you also have a 200mm or 8 inch wheel?

Darn it, I did not updated my list.... 
I initially had a 149kv, but I recalculated with a 213kv to get close to 8.600 RPM. So the calculation shows my planned setup.

The Trampa does not fit my wheel hubs. I designed a 3d printed drive hub:
