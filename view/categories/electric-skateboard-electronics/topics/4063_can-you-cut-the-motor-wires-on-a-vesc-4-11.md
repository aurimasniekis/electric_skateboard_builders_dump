My electric skateboard is almost finished. However, I am having trouble fitting all my electronics into the enertion deck. Is there any way that I can cut the vesc wires to shorten them?

Yea, you can cut the wires and solder on new connectors. or just cut the middle out of the wire and resolder the two pieces together.
