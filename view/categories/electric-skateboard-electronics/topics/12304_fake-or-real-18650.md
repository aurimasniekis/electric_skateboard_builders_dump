with clones you never know. Basically everything about these cells can be fake. Buy genuine brand name cells!

I agree w @Maxid - real cells are a better bet. Saving $60 to end up with a while pack that has problems is not a good deal. They call them "clones" so there's no guarantee of performance. 

One of the main benefits of DIY battery packs is that you can assure that you get authentic brand-name cells.
