Both motors have the same symptoms.
There is no change when the temperature rises.
I am using VESC6.
The sk8 sk3 maytech motor is good.

Flipsky reply.

After doubled check with the workshop, I was told that the temparature sensor wire of the motor is just for showing and it's not with an actual function.
