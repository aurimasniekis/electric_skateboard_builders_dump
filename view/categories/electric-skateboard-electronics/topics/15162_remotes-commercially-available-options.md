So I've bought a few remotes over the last few months.  Not all of the available options, but quit a few.  I figured I'd give my impressions for any new people.  Just to be clear, these are are ONLY the remotes I have used and liks to where I got them.  There are multiple sources for many of these, I linked where I got them.  I also want to mention that I am partial to thumb trigger remotes, they feel more natural to me and they tend to be smaller than the other options.

[**Miami Electric Boards Remote**](http://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/handheld-electric-remote) (Benchwheel)

This is my favorite remote by far.  It has a really good battery, the thumb trigger is very responsive and has a lot of travel.  It has a great battery, I charge it once a week.  I don't know how tough it is, I've never dropped it or spilled with it.  I think there is some sort of ramp limiting built into the receiver, but if there's not I don't know how to explain the beauty that is the throttle control in this remote.

This remote has a Cruise and a Full mode.  I typically use Cruise mode as it lengthens the ramp up.

The white labels you see on the sides are mine, they do not come on the remote.

[**Benchwheel Remote & Receiver**](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Electric-skateboard-refitting-parts-remote-control-bench-technology/32731985084.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.S5hVGU)

This is the same remote as above, just a few bucks cheaper and takes a month or longer to get.  It performs the same as above.  The only visual difference is this one has a set of printed labels by lights.  The receivers are almost identical, the MEB RX is about 1/8 in longer.  

I would suggest that if you are going to by a Benchwheel remote, by the MEB remote and support one of the few vendors in this community.  If you purchase this one make sure you select the item with the receiver, you can buy only the remote or the remote & receiver.

[**Enertion Nano-X**](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/nano-x-enertion-2-4ghz-controller/)
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/b/4b2bd59e99228341efd0a39b50701f832586b6f8.jpg" width="423" height="500">
I really like this remote, it performs very well.  The trigger is very responsive and has very little dead range in it.  It has a really good battery, I think a charge once a week is likely all it needs.  It feels tough, I've dropped it a couple of times and it hasn't hurt it yet..

It has a beginner mode (the switch just below the thumb trigger, up position), I normally use it, then just switch it off when I want to go fast or stop quickly.  It has a CH2 switch (bottom front), but I havent tried it yet.  I will eventually when I settle on the front lights I want.  It also has a "Throttle Mirror Mode" which is used to reverse the Throttle/Brake on the thumb trigger.  Its very feature rich, the most feature rich of all the remotes I have used.

The first time I connected Enertion Nano-X and had binding issues.  I moved the RX away from the VESC and issues are gone.  I don't know if that's because of proximity to the VESC or if the connector cable needs to be straight (looped wire, induction effect?).  I've turned it ON/OFF over a dozen times, no issues at all.

A lot of people have had issues with cut outs, I haven't, but I am still not a fan of this remote.  It's so small that the trigger has too little travel.  It has a great battery and feels really good in my hand, but the travel makes its unattractive to me.

[**GT2B**](https://www.amazon.com/2-4GHz-3-Channel-Transmitter-Discontinued-manufacturer/dp/B00FS2U9BA) with [**Master Cho enclosure**](https://electric-skateboard.market/product/gt2b-electric-skateboard-controller-housingcase-enclosure/)
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/7/97f2cf8c7d6673d93f075da4a06d1b6972a870c4.jpg" width="371" height="500">
I really like this remote, it performs well and it cheap at less than $30.  The enclosure adds $25, but its well worth it and there are multiple enclosure designs available.  The trigger is very responsive and has very little dead range in it.  It is a great remote for people that don't mind the size.  It has a really good battery, I charge it maybe once a week.  It's tough too, although that it mostly the Master Cho enclosure being tough as nails.



---

In closing, I think the [Enertion Nano-X](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/nano-x-enertion-2-4ghz-controller/) and the [MEB Remote](http://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/handheld-electric-remote) are tied for the '**Best Remote**'.  I really like the feel of the MEB/Benchwheel remote the best, but its not much better.  The features of the Enertion Nano-X are pretty sweet.  Both have triggers that are smooth as butter and both are pretty inexpensive.

To the best of my knowledge, there's no cruise control on the Benchwheel. The red button is the power button. I've had a few different remotes as well and so far the Benchwheel tops my list.

Have you tested the mini remote? That one seems to be one of the best remotes out there.

I've never tried that one and didn't really consider it cause it seemed so big, but after seeing a picture somewhere (could find it after searching) it's actually not much bigger than something like a Badwolf. I've also heard good things about its reliability.

I am partial to the thumb trigger remotes. It's easier for me to control at high speeds. I like GT2B a lot, but the Benchwheel beets it hands down.  

I'm looking forward to trying g the Enertion Nano-X.

Cool topic. I actually think this should be ''pinned'' somewhere, for beginners to read :slight_smile:
Would be great to find out more about beginner and ''expert / pro'' mode of the benchweel remote..

@mmaner Like - how much slower/peaceful is the beginner mode compared to the pro mode?

I assume beginner mode is more limited.. while pro is just the way it is (not restriction)

Regarding th Benchwheel remote...Technically it lowers the ramp to 70%, but I don't really see a difference in top speed.  So in short I don't really know.  I'll measure the total throughout with the BLDC tool torrow and post the results.

If anyone wants info on other remotes send it to me and I'll post it at the top.  I might even get one to try for myself.

I personally got that mini remote which @tueboard seems to be using now and @Eboosted mentioned.   

 Reliable. Batteries (2xAA) last a long time. Trigger works good although I extended its play a bit by allowing it to move farther than the stock trigger end walls allowed.
Turn on switch could have been bigger.Hard to turn on or off with a glove on a hand lol. 

Besides that I plan to perhaps mod it - make diy beginner mode by adding resistors (saw this recently on another thread)

No you can't. Sometimes I change the throttle trim when I'm cruising near shops and it is kind of cruise control. But you can't get more than 5kmh with it

The mini remote is perfect for cruise control. That's what i am using. Just handle the throttle with the middle finger and the steering wheel with the finger between the middle finger and the thumb (no idea how you call in english, let's say cruise finger :joy:) Or you can also use the thumb to activate cruise.

@Ackmaniac The word you're looking for is the index finger 😀

Please explain a bit more about cruise control. It's kind of hard to see what you are doing in the video.

The mini remote has a throttle and a steering wheel. When i don't touch the throttle and turn the steering wheel then cruise control gets activated. When i release the steering wheel or touch the throttle or brake it will be deactivated.

At the moment i spent some time optimizing the cruise control so that it can be used for carving. In the actual firmware it is already quite nice but in the next release it will be even better. But to make the same optimization for the Nunchuk is not that easy. The cruise control PID controller will also be adjustable via the app later on. Because each time the motor amps get changed the PID controller needs fine adjustments. But with the app it will be easy to find a good setup quickly.

I also want to implement the feature to change from BLDC to FOC via app. But for that a restart will be necessary. That means you press the butten in the app and it will take around 3 seconds to update and restart the Master and all slave VESCs.
So you can decide by yourself if you want to run in silent or sound mode.

Will 'ŗesurrect' this topic.. Are there any remotes where there is an actual 'wheel'' inside of remote, not just a little 'stick' pointing outwards?

Im talking about thumb operated remotes here, and I cannot find one, where there was this wheel thing instead of little stick..

I would like to go with the wheel because in my mind it might allow better precision and 'stick' control somehow still seems like it could be too responsive.

I know I seen a 3d design somewhere, so I dont expect commercial remote to be made that way.. but still thought it might be worth asking

Pretty sure Boosted's uses a full wheel. You could do it with a magnetic Hall sensor I think. The stick and material underneath is just easier though.
