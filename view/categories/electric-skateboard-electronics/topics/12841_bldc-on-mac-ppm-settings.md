Ok what am I missing here.

I can't find how to get the display to show the percentage. I want to change my pulsewidth min and max so my trigger isn't so sensitive but I would like to see if idle will be at 50%.

You're not connected to the VESC... see the bottom right corner "Not Connected"

well I know that. I was just quickly taking a screenshot of the interface. I can't see it even when I am connected.

Also what is the best OS for using BLDC? I feel like the OSX version is a little buggy.
