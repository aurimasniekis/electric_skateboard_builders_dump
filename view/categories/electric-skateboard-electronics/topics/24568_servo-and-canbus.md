The Canbus cable connects the 2 vescs and it has 2 wires. The servo cable connects the receiver to the vesc and has 3 wires.

Your drawings are fine. The vesc with the receiver plugged in is the master and the other is the slave. Use different ID numbers.

You will find the information in the link I posted for you. Master has usually ID 0 and the slave has ID 1.
