Hmm never thought about using a scooter or bike switch. They usually use much higher amps so the switch should be robust. Lmk how that works out and do you have a link?

Where did you buy it from?

The switches from @goldenHusky are really good, all of them working on mine and friend boards.

I'd install two switches in parallel to support that amount of current.

Iâ€™ve been thinking about that, do you think I could hook the buttons together in parallel so thereâ€™s only one button for the two switches?

Yes, just split the NO, NC and C pins on both switches.

In case the Luna switch is not working how expected.

The Luna switch is exactly the same switch as torqueboards anti spark switch, just with another label on it and 20$ cheaper

I had quite an issue with Luna switches - short circuit burned the FETs and kept the circuit closed.
This in combination with the lack of fuse is potentially disastrous.
The marking on the FETs is intentionally removed to prevent repairs  ... d1ck move, Luna :angry:

Cheers folks!

I've seen those lunacycle switches for a while.  No complaints really from ebike forum.
