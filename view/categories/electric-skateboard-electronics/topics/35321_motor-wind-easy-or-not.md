Hey guys,

I know there is a thing called "motor winding" (i think ) 
Anyway, my question is:
-Is it easy or hard to do this
-Is it possible to bring a 270KV motor to 200kv?

Thanks for your reply :)

it is hard to wind motors.

also can you please google before creating a topic here?

I think you've already accomplished the winding up?

Because you looked up winding a motor that means to wind up, you should look up unwinding a motor

Rewinding a motor isn't that hard to do, but it's hard to do it well and do it right the first time. To lower the kv of a motor, you need to increase the number of windings per stator. This means you have to use thinner wire, because more windings take up more room. Once you've figured out how many windings you need, you need to figure out how fat the wire you need can be, and still fit enough windings. Once you do that, then you need to actually wind it, and not mess up halfway through, because then you'll have to start over. Shorts, scraped insulation, misjudged wire sizes, all can cause you to redo your windings.

There are lots of videos of people rewinding motors, go look them up and make sure you can do it, before you take apart your motor.

I would not recommend rewinding a motor that works, unless your ok with the possibility that it might never run again...

I have realized after rewinding many motors, you should dip the windings in motor winding epoxy. This stuff is not cheap, and hard for the average joe to get.

Most of the motors I've rewound without dipping, burnt out quickly. This is because the wires vibrations, scratching the protective insulation off, and the motor shorts...

Also, it's hard to unwind due to the fact they were almost certainly dipped when they were wound in the factory. Damaging the stator means you mess up the magnetic field in the motor, possibly causing inefficiencies which could lead to overheating.

Read through this thread, it might have some helpful info.

If you rewound the 270kV it would be 158kV so you'd likely need a bigger motor pulley as well. I have a feeling that if you stuffed a larger wheel pulley into that kit the belt would scrape on the edge of the pulley cover. My initial plan was to up the motor pulley to a 18T and rewind but I've been having trouble finding a 18T in the right size.

Oh ok, that sounds good for me I will definitely look into that. did you make the pulley system yourself, buy them separately or buy a kit? also what wheel size do you have them on?

I ran them on 83mm wheels.  You wont be able to run a 48tooth pulley on like 70mm wheels though

The only problem is the 3D printer I will be using is quite bad :/ I will probaly try to find a kit on ebay or something.

What was the pitch and width of the pulleys?

Mono drive with 6s lipos. I have since upgraded to steel pulleys and a liion 6s pack with a 245kv motor and the difference is huge

w/6s lipo

Another option, if u have access to the magnet wire and they come out of the motor and haven't been soldered to  leads, u can go strand by strand finding the starts and ends and then put all the ends together changing from the common delta termination to wye and drop the kv like 45%

or with the multistrand that everyone uses you could find each start and end, and put them all in a series.  I don't know how many strands they use for one turn but I'm guessing six small strands.  and guessing what you have is delta terminated as almost all are, and 7 turns of wire around each tooth.  six small wires bundled together twisted round teeth 7 times each tooth.  and if you connected all the small wires together and you now had a wire 6x as long you'd have 42 turns.  no idea but guessing 5kv or something like that.  and a big motor pulley.  or you could adjust how many you put in series or parallel and also adjusting the kv.  not that I've done it recommend it but pretty cool and who knows maybe easier than it sounds.  with just an led and battery would work and you could do any of these.  and a program to do the switching at the right time...why don't they have that

Haha thats a funny idea, wouldn't do that 5kv motor^^ probably could handle very few amps before melting.

How did you get your pulleys to work? I'm doing a build where I need a 1:4 gear ratio and I bought 12:48 pulleys. However according to the sdpsi pulley calculator 12:48 doesn't have enough teeth meshing on the motor pulley. My belt skips teeth when I quickly accelerate or brake. I'm using 9 mm HTD 5 belt w 62 teeth. Any advice is appreciated üôèüèæüôèüèæ
