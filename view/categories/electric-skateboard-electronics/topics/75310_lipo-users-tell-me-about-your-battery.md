Hey guys
Atm I'm running a standard LiPo system at 10s 8000mah with bms and whatnot. 

I however want to upgrade my system (candid) 

Now the aim if this thread is to see if anyone else has upgraded to their LiPo's either Turnigy graphenes or nano techs and if they notice a severe difference. OR if anyone has gone from graphenes to nano tech or vice versa and can tell me if there's a crazy difference between them.

Thank yaz!

The nano techs severely sag under high amp and become puffy very quickly. C rating is most certainly fake by a large margin.

If you have a single drive they will probably do fine.

I am a long time nano tech user. I totally disagree. I have a very high opinion of them. Didn't measure data myself but i have read many users at rc community reporting real c claims. Actually those are the only lipos that are not over exaggerated at the store.
I have an old pack still alive and It has 0 bulge.
I guess you have a different experience. I respect your opinion.

Different experience is most likely based on the amp draw of your application and the mah of the lipo you used. In my experience, the 2000-3000mah range ''90c'' nano tech could not handle the abuse of 30A constant draws nearly as well as the regular 30C lipos sold by HK (Rhino, Zippy). All nano techs died premature and were significantly hotter after use. Charge cycles were almost cut in half compared to the others. 

Mind you, I never discharge below 3.7V.

[/quote]

4x heavy duty 5000mah, 12S total. So far, they are better than Zippy 8000 mah packs and are most certainly far superior to nano tech. My Trampa easily pulls 50A per motor when charging up hill full power.

I owned:
Turnigy Graphene (excellent performance, good amount of charge cycles, good during winter)
Turnigy Nano Tech 90c (No good for what I own, amp draw too high)
Zippy Flightmax 8000 30C (OK, if you stick to 3.7V lowest discharge)
Turnigy Heavy Duty 5000 mah 60C (better than Flightmax, less sag and can go to 3.6V without heating up)

The Nano techs were also useless in drone applications. It is the lipo I started out with, but they kept dying.

damn ok. i was thinking of going for a 10s2p in the 4500mah nano techs so I'm not sure now. maybe with them in parallel they won't be under as much stress....? do it for science?

Keep in mind they are good for 25C constant or so.
Base your calculations around that and if it matches your system, they will probably be fine.

Not yet, but i haven't ran them down and they are brand new. I know from pasat experience with lipos they'll sag a bit worse at lower charge levels, and general sag will get worse as the battery ages, especially if you thrash it

2x 4S1P 6,000mAh 65~130c Graphene user here. Mine is mounted in parallel to make 8S1P. I run two Max6 ESCs with two 6374 192kV SK3s off them. Zero sag until they’re well below 3.5V, I’ve run them right down early after my first build.

They don’t get even luke warm to the touch when fanging it, which is how I ride all the time. I’m almost 100kg loaded up with my backpack, and I have hills. My motors get warm, even my e-toxx gear drives, but never my Graphenes.

Looks like your in the running for a BMS, HobbyKing has an 8s bms for the price of a coke and sausage roll atm, as a charge only bms I think it would work well and is actually a bestech branded bms

i´m getting a cheap chinese bluetooth bms soon.
will do a bms adapter for the packs, so that I can use my brick charger with different lipo packs. In the same time I can set my blance voltage etc. and monitor everything via app.
think it´s a good an cheap opportunity to a big balance charger.
(not as good as an I charger, but also way much cheaper)

Yep, only one is needed an will balance all cells to 4.2v. I have one for my 10s and 12s packs (just diff brand). You will also need a psu for your batteries, the correct voltage is required so 4.2 x 8. That should be the max voltage of the charger although if you have a 8s balance charger that can be used too just without using the balance function and connecting straight to the main leads.

Tested alot of lipos since 2015, mainly turnigy and gens ace, the blue series and the tattu series.
Bloating is not mutch of a concern, mainly it increases the internal resistance a bit. Performence wise the lipos outperform 18650 cells by mutch. If you have good cells you wont notice a difference in speed while riding and will mostly have an eaven ride untill the board suddently gets depleted.
If you want density and range go for 18650, if you want mad power, go for lipo defenetly.
PS: lipo is litterally liion in a polimer pack.
Read up on NCR, INR, MNR liions

I use turnigy and zippy. set of 4 x 5s 5000 and set of 4 x 6s 4500 on eMTB
They been really good to me, no issues what so ever.  
I had pushed them to over 70 amps on the whole system and they haven't done much save get slightly warm.
No sag that I can feel even as boston winter hit.
Turnigy seems a little higher quality.

Consider the main use of lipos like quadcopters puts significantly bigger amp load on them then Eboards, I think you'd be fine as long as you stay off the bottom of the barrel.

I use 4x Graphene packs  ( 6,000mAh 65) 2 x in parallel, 2x in series. [malJohann](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/malJohann) has summed up these pretty well,  Their expensive  so always be on the look out for hobbyking deals but probably the best batteries iv ever used and well worth the money, i doubt ill ever use anything but graphene packs ever again.

Hey man, I was just looking for some help on a battery I want to build. I want a 12S4P Li-Po pack. Here is my math. 4 x 3S1P Li-Po's will give me 12S1P @ 44.4V. I will than add 3(?) more of the same Li-Po's in parallel to increase my total capacity. Is that math correct?
Here are the batteries I want to use:

incorrectomundo.
4 of these make 12s1p correct. 
however you need 4 12s1p packs in parallel to make 12s4p. So you're looking at 16 3s1p lipos. also don't buy cheap shit please. look into HobbyKing

I have both the nano tech 25-50 and graphenes 60c on 10s setup and interchange them back to back on dual 6374 and can tell you the nano techs give me longer range and perform just as well as the graphenes with zero puffing. I commute 35km with these too so they are well tested. I think everyone just jumps on the bandwagon when they hear things and spread the same message without having experienced it for themselves. I’m not saying that people haven’t had bad nano techs but just adding my experience with them on eskate instead of drones and rc which tend to give them a bad rap due to their higher draw rates.

HRB sent the batteries to my country via UPS. 

About the Turnigy, I do not know, I bought them new from a private seller within my country, in a hurry to use my board while I was waiting for the HRB ones (2 weeks, bad choice), and they puffed (not destroy, but lost my trust), they do push, but the difference is big against the other brand. 

I heard great things about graphene batteries, also from SMC Racing, did not try them because with the price of 2 HRB I could pay 1 graphene, and SMC do not send batteries to my country (they where my 1st choice), and I need 4 of them cause im running twins.
