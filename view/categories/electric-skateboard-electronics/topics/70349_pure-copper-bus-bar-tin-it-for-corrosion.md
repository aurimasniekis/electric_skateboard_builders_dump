Hi there,
I have bough a set of second hand very pure electrolytic copper sheets (0.5mm thickness) that I inted to use as busbar for a battery pack (with cell fuse). Is it recommended to tin it to avoid corrosion ? 
I have some experience with cold chemical tinning for PCBs (a liquid in which you put your pcbs). Is that recommended for copper busbars ? Is there a better technique ?

Once it oxidizes I don’t believe it will corrode any further so it acts as a sort of protective barrier. I’ve never coated any of my copper bus bars.

Yes it's similar to aluminum a layer of oxidation forms on the material effectively sealing it so it won't continue to corrode.
