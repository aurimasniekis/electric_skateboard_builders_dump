All of these motors have a similar (if not the same) design to Chaka's motors and Evolve's GT motors.

I would use a FVT 120a ESC. That one you can also order from Banggood. 
You should also be aware that these motors do not fit most of the common used motor mounts. You will have to make your own.

Anyone have any update about these motors.  I just ordere a 6368 280kv from them.  I really don't know how this motor will work with my 2 to 6s goolrc 120A esc.   I am only running a 6s battery.   Maybe I should have order a 5065 200kv instead.

@Wilsonliang777 please post a review, once you get it/them!

@paragon I actually wanted to create a similar topic and ask if anyone has tried them yet? But gladly, the search baloon opened and showed you have already created a topic for this!

-----
Anyways, price looks really good, considering they are also sensored.. just hard to tell what the customs fee might be.. if it does show up..

Too bad the 63'' ones does not come with lower kv.. Though, these 5065 looks like could be a really good solution for low cost dual drive :)

--

So yes - if anyoe has them, could you give a review?
Interested in - are they reliable, are the bearings / shaft in similar quality like sk3?

@Wilsonliang777 

Ok, report back then when you receive.. though you should consider that this ''brake function'' might mean it is on / off brake.. and you would then need to seek other options how to make the brake softer.. If this esc does have progressive brake then congrats.. but will only see once you get it :)

They sent me a more expansive one.  The  BRH 6368 instead of the BRD6368.  the BRH 6368 has a longer shift and sensored.    The longer shift does. Not fit my built.  They have not respond to my email yet.   Maybe they are on Chinese new year break.   Their website said they will respond to problems within 24 hours.  It's been almost 32 to 48 hours now.

The shaft is just too long.  I wish I could use the motor but I have to make other adjustments like getting longer belt and chain And drilling more holes on the motor mount.   Frustrating when you have All the parts ready then You received the wrong order.  It will take another 2 to 4 weeks of waiting to fix his problem.

The BRH6368 is the same specs.

I want to use this motor on a mountain board.  The shaft is too long therefor it is touching the wheel.  If I keep this motor I have to extend the motor mount outward and get a longer belt because the motor pulley and the wheel pulley  further apart.   Yes.  I can also just cut the shaft.  The shaft looks pretty hard.   How easy is it to cut it her a hand saw?  I never cut one before.    

After 48 hours Banggood finally responded to my complaint.   They requested pictures and I sent them pictures.   The problem with oversea sellers are it take 4 to 5 days for one exchange of emails.

I have cut stepper motor shafts before with a angle grinder but you have to do it in small bursts and let it cool down so not to damage anything. Alternatively you could use a new hacksaw blade but I would put a small piece of plastic tube over the shaft or wrap tape around it so you don't damage it if you slip, then clean up the edges with a file.

Good luck.

I received the esc and it work.   The brake is in soft setting ion default.    The bad part is programing it.  Counting beep is comfusing and you Are never sure if your setting is saved or not.    I only installed it and powered it on.   I have not tested on the road yet.  Hope I can do that tonight.   But it looks promising for $25.

Update. 

No. the esc would not work for electric skateboard because if lacks the neutral function.  It will run the motor but if you let go of the trigger it will apply the brake.  And the brake is pretty hard even on soft mode.    I almost fell off my board going around 15mph because of the brake applying when I was trying to just cruise on neutral.

Banggood issued me a refund so their cs is really good.  I got to keep the 6386 motor.  I have not done anyone with he motor yet.   I did ordered a 5065 200kv motor from them because I felt guilty for getting a refund.  I did not request a refund they just issued me a refund.    I might have some free time this weekend so i will post an update.

U probably have to find that type of connector.. then just remove the wire you dont need.. I believe one extra wire could be for temp sensor..

Shouldnt this be in the manual / datasheet for the motor? i think they mentioned what kind of sensor plug they got..

On a side not.. u should look up is it worthy to install sensors for car esc at all.. Im not entirely sure but it was possible that for car escs it sensored mode it did not work as smooth as it should.. 

Though, check on your own.. as im not 100% sure this was the case..

I like the idea that heatsink is exposed and that it has 3 caps..

Non the less, here is the ''customization options'' for FVT 120 (which in my opinion, is a bit ''richer'' compared to the ones shown for racerstar)

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/7/d7110165223bbfe90f871c6956e2b74b6d83ae8b.gif" width="599" height="416">


Here it is for RacerStar:

I do like that brake can be adjusted in about 10steps (fvt) instead of 4.. also it is possible to ''calibrate'' throttle range, if you dont want max power available. 4 acceleration settings for fvt, instead of 3.

----
Plus, the usb link programmer for FVT costs 8usd, 15usd for ''portable lcd box'', for this one it costs something like 22 usd.. so the price difference is not as big, if you count in the cost of programmers.

So, 
FVT: around 59 - 65 usd (usb or lcd box)
Racerstar: 45usd (esc + programmer box)
--

Dont know about the sound of Racerstar Esc, but I personally think that FVT is quite silent and does not give off braking sound.. (other than the fan noise, which is constantly spinning)

Not saying racerstar is bad. It is just not tested, costs a bit less, also has a bit less functions / parameters.

Im most sceptical abou the noise, as I think these escs who have it are a bit annoying (though some say it is good for letting others know you are there lol)

I got the 5065 200kv motor and was able to install it.  It's working and I have no issue with this motor.   I am running it with 6s,  car esc, single drive system and With 1:3 gear system.   

The gear attached to the motor is a 15t M5 pulley.  The gear is very hard get off.  I had to buy a pulley remover to remove this pulley.

The racerstar motor looks exactly like the OM5065 motor. Even the sensor cable design is the same.  Good deal $43 for a OM5065 motor.

The pulleys ARE a pain the butt to remote. I had to remove them from my Evolve motors(same motor). After trying to use many tools, I found using an open end wrench(14mm in my case) worked awesome for removing it. You can stack two wrenches together once its off just a little bit(or any spacer really).  I heated it up with a hair dryer before trying to take it off too(heat gun is at work :p ).

Hey guys I just received the sensored 140KV 5065. But not from banggood as they where sold out. I got it from [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Arrival-Racerstar-5065-BR5065-140KV-6-12S-Brushless-Motor-With-Gear-For-RC-Motorcycle-Multicopter/32775150885.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.d2Dq0D)

The quality looks really nice but they are 70mm long and now I need wider trucks. I need 10 extra mm so I need a hanger that is at least 215mm wide with total axle around 300mm, anyone got any recommendations?

Anyone know the correct way to wire the sensor to the VESC?

I have not tried to remove the pulley yet but it is press fit and a tiny grub screw for extra security. Im going to try blow torch and spanner pry.

it is HTD5 - I use it on my pneumatics build. Annoying is just the different hole spacing so that it does not fit to regular SK3 motor mounts. In my case I simply just use 2 instead of 4 screws to hold it.

Hi,
This thread a full of interesting information.
I'd like to put a motor on my scooter, and don't really know which one I'll go for.
Let me just explain the plan.
I'll be using a 4:1 reduction with 5M belt (12-48 teeth), and have a 200mm wheel and 6s lipo.
My question is, which motor should I use ? Is a 5065 140kv strong enough ? Or should I go for larger motor like 6368 ? The max speed is not really an issue, doesn't matter if I can't go above 20km/h.
Thanks you any input.

Hi guys , i just wanna thank you all, the info in this thread help me make my board, all the parts came from aliexpress and banggood, except for the board, its from ebay 


The motor pulley is from banggood, wheel pulley from aliexpress, although the screw hole are mis-align, so i had it redone for new screw hole.

Does anyone know whenever these motors have the same speed / torque / power as mentioned in specs?

Im speacialyy interested in 200kv and 280kv (5065 and 5060) motors. So far i only found one person giving a subjective remark that the 280kv one has great torque for his eboard. 

Though this does not say much whenever kv rating is true or also 'drifts' up or down, meaning 200kv motor could be either 190kv or 220kv. 

If someone had tachometer and one of these motors would be great to find out their real speed :)

EDIT jlabs is right, divide by number of pole pairs (usually 7)

actually, the procedure is, go to terminal screen, type kv but don't hit enter. full throttle, then hit enter. No math required.

I think I tested my 200kv banggood 5065, was around 180-190kv in vesc terminal. I got to about 28mph on a 10s 36t/16t. My first belt single, so I don't have much to compare, but it felt good.

Thanks for feedback! So it seems like 200kv is lower in kv than written in specs. I wonder what is the situation with 280kv motor and also whenever load / belt attached makes the kv number lower, in theory i think it should.

Esk8 calc after all always reduces motor rpm, indicating it will be lower at load but still not sure can belt make this number that much lower compared to the test with no belt.

 So i suspect for real no load motor kv test belt should not be attached to motor pulley.

190kv

Just tested the Racerstar 6368 BRD6368 280KV on BLDC. I ran the motor on full power on 8s and hit KV on terminal, came back at: Calculated KV: 1818.25 rpm/volt. does this mean the motor is 182 KV?

Well it does not sound right to me but im also not sure what i can recommend. I think.it should have given u precise number or at least 5000 rpm or so, so that you can get kv rating by dividing max rpm by voltage at that moment.

1800 rpm sounds somewhat too low as max rpm and too much for rpm per volt

I was wrong. Whatever you get in terminal with the kv command, divide by 7 (number of pole pairs, almost all the usual motors have 7).

In your case the result is 259.76. Might want to do it a few times. Maybe with belt removed.

I remeasured the 5065 (with belt/wheel), it rings up 1268 rpm/volt, 181kv.

I also have the 5045 (unloaded), 1368 rpm/volt, 195kv.

@deucesdown Thanks for clarification about pole pairs.. forgot about such thing and im still not an vesc user.

The data you posted about 5045 unloaded motor sounds reliable. Would be nice to find out whenever wheel / belt attached to motor can bring down the kv number by about 14kv ? 

Or the 5065 ones (or the one u have) just run slower / with less kv? 

---

@rolexbene if kv number with wheel attaches is close to 260kv that's pretty good, I was a bit scared it might be close to 300kv when unloaded and might lack some strenght / torque I need. 

So yeh, non the less, nice to hear it stays around 260kv, which might prove to be just the sweet spot for the setup / build I need.

---
And big shout / thanks for posting the data @rolexbene ! I've been really curious about these motors since they seem a really good choice (price / power / construction wise) but there are not that many reviews / feedback about these motors. 

I have seen a couple of evolve board riders have installed them but they usually dont share much info about their performance and other stats, just report the increased speed they get when installing 200kv ones.

@darkkevind im not sure as of yet what bearing type these motors have but but guys on ES forum kept saying good things about skirt bearings, which the bigger size motors tend to use.

If.u look closer, u can see the bearing close to axle and it looks like it has many pieces.. like some shittier skateboard wheel bearings tend to look, so.im not 100% sure do they qualify in the same league, someone with more experience in motors should step in.

Maybe @Hummie or @JLabs can tell the truth.

Otherwise they still seem like good motors to me and people who have bought.them seem to be still using them and not complain about faults or damage.

All extra i know is they resemble ollin motors, evolve even seem to be almost.using same exact motors (just lower kv) and screw spacing might be different from turnigy sk3 motor spacing pattern, so mounts might need to be custom made (or new holes)

Are these considered an outrunner motor? I weight aroun175 lbs and will be doing a single drive board. Would the 190kv work nice for going 20 mph and about 12+15 miles range. I do like the price of the brh series being sensored and they seem to be like the bees knees for the price

Thanks! Can you tell me which setting have you used for that motor? I mean:
Throttle Setting: Hard start/Soft start
Timing: 1º/7º/15º/30º 
PWM: 8Khz/16khz

This beeping programming is really annoying. 
I think that problem is in ESC cause if I grab wheel by hand motor won't start and stutter so it can't handle even resistance of my hand. Which timing have you set?
My gear is 12/40 and 7 inch wheel so quite powerfull.

I'm out of my garage till Friday and I will send you photo of my construction. I must disappoint you cause I don't have breaking system. I heard that motor give enough breaking power. I would like to say that my board is not designed for riding off road. 7 inch wheels are for uneven pavements in my city. 
I'm not sure about gear in my case is 3.3 :1. Without wheel and gear motor also stuttered when I squeeze outer case of  motor in hand but i must do it very strong :) 

When I will be in garage I will check different options of timing in ESC and also I will measure current from batt to ESC when motor stutter.

I have dual 5045 on my deck. Pretty good for me, running 14:40 on 97mm wheels. Running 25A battery max (per motor) and 100A motor max on 10S and they send me flying uphill. Wouldn't recommend for extremely hilly areas, they do get hot after climbing a steep ~200ft hill. I'm sure they wouldn't get quite as hot if I used a 90mm wheel instead.

Top speed on a flat is around 28mph.

As to how they fit on calibers, I can't tell you. But, I was able to design my own motor mount on 180mm Paris trucks that would fit both motors with 12mm belts.

I've also run dual 5065s, and those really get you going without heating up at all.

Cheers!

You do realize that the internal wires will still be the same thickness and would also "burn up"? There is no point in changing the wires (maybe if they are ridiculously long and you are worried about losses but you can't run higher currents just because you replaced the wires going to the motor)

No, I thought they usually got small since lots of motors use 12awg phase leads I though that once inside the motor the actual windings would need to be small to fit in the stator teeth when being wound. 

Thanks for letting me know this

Like @pat.speed I thought changing only the wires going out of the motor would be fine.
Looking at a SK3 disassembled https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g9rcv6K5qA the coils are using thin copper but the wires going out are bigger. So basically, cutting out the wires going out of the motor up to the coils wires, and solder bigger wires should do it I think ?
It's super annoying to do though, might be better spending $20 on a motor with proper wiring.

We are still looking for the golden goose. 6374, 150kv to 200kv, **SENSORED,** and preferably with silicone wires and at Chinese direct prices.   Oh and sealed can style so no rocks get in there and its stronger, the ones with all the holes break more easily. 

First factory to make this combo will get a lot of orders.

Awesome find! $40 usd and you can even customize the KV. The standard KV is 180kv which is pretty decent for 12s. I wonder if we could ask for silicone wires also.

In the sentence before this one he said himself that the coils are this thin - what should the benefit be of bigger phase wires? Please explain to me what you guys think will happen! More current? The bottleneck will still be the windings.

No I realise that the the phase wire size will not allow for more current, although it will help to keep the wires cooler. If the windings are the same sized as the phase leads that would mean this motor would be able to handle maybe 10amps max before the windings or phase leads melt. I presumed that the windings would be larger than these tiny leads so by adding larger phase leads, yes you would be able to use more current. Like I said before I did not know that the windings are the same size as the phase leads. Even though there must be some benefit because look at every major motor manufacturer they all use larger wires around 12awg but small windings, why is this? I don't know but there must be a reason, maybe you can tell us?

Very excited to see the Brotherhobby brand though. Highest quality multirotor motors I have ever flown. They tend to listen to customers. Ask for 190KV and explain why and you may receive.

Edit:sent brother hobby a PM through rcgroups. They are very active there. 

Key features typically associated with their motors.
Proper silicone flexible phase wires. Arc magnets/reduced air gap for increased efficiency and torque. Last but not least, tidy windings & high quality bearings.

If the measurements are correct, it's not a 6374.
See that post, there are measurements for a real 6374, the can by itself + the read cover is 80mm http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diyeboard-com-china-factory-direct-retail-electric-skateboard-diy-kits-and-parts/32666/1156
