Is there a cheaper option besides the one Enertion offers to charge the Space Cell Pro 4?

Is this the exact same charger that Enertion sells as their "fast charger" upgrade??

Interesting! I'm actually very pleased with Enertion's stock charger, works well and my Raptor seems to charge fairly quickly. Haven't timed it from flat but I know I got from 80% to 100 in under an hour Yesterday. Think I'll just order another SpaceCell to leave charging when I'm out n this way can swap them out instantly as n when needed.
