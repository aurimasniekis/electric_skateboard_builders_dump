To be honest I'd recommend that you move up a motor size to 63mm motor for your first build ...

I know how the board I'm making will be used...no hills ...on flat ground....and it won't be pushed to high speed ...so I know The 50mm will be fine

```
Then should be fine... 

It's a sensored motor so I figured I'd just use a sensored esc
