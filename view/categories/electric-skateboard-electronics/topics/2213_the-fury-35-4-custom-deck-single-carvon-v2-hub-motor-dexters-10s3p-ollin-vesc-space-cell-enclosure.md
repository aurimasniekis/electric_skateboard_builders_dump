Hello guys, my name is Agust√≠n. I'm 22 years old and I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I was looking to build my very first electric longboard but I have some questions. I'm not very good with this sort of creative stuff, and in my country its very hard to find the required equipment to build one. I was thinking to buy the 3 items from Carvon Skates, anyone has some experience with them? What else do I need apart from the batteries? Which batteries would be nice for this setup? I'll be staying in the US for 15 days in May, so I need to buy everything then. I already have a board to build it, I wish to spend 600U$S or less including the listed items down below or similar items that you can recommend.

That's a good set up 
For that ESC you will need a ubec in order to power the receiver. 
Since you are going to be in the USA for a limited time order in advance to avoid any delay.

P.S 
Torqueboard remote is the same but he charges less for it

Edit: I can't go over 650U$S (I dont need a board). And I need to be able to carry the components in the plane with me, I understand that the batteries can't be over 99WH.

Whats an UBEC? Which batteries should I get?

Thank you Kaly

the batteries will be very difficult to get by security
about the 600.00 you need to be flexible, do you have a charger ? or a power supply ? this are other spences 

the ubec you can get here 
http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__72702__Turnigy_Multistar_Twin_Output_5_10_Amp_6_50V_SBEC_for_Lipoly_AR_Warehouse_.html

there you can check the batteries too
http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__16225__ZIPPY_Flightmax_8000mAh_3S1P_30C_Lipo_Pack.html
you can get 4 of this for a 12s setup.

You could go with a conventional belt driven setups to get the cost lower. 

torqueboard's and Enertion sell kits with motors, trucks, wheels, and mounting hardware for very reasonable prices.

Like @cmatson said if you want to save money, use a single drive satellite motor system. I got a bunch of basically brand new stuff for that.  if you want.

Two of those in series will give you about 97 watt hours. Yes i just went through hobby king's listings and did a bunch of math, but it was kind of interesting to see what i could grab for a target watt hour range.

and they're only $30 each.

---
## \#16 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2016-04-08T18:03:59.494Z Reads: 169

```
yeah these would be fine in series. And as far as charging goes, you can either go with a single 6S charger and charge them separately one at a time, or go with a dual 6S charger and charge them separately at the same time.

Another option would be to tear both packs down and make a proper 8S pack out of the pouches and use an 8S charger. Not sure if its worth the effort, but the extra work would allow you to use a single charge port and just plug the charger into the board instead of having to unplug packs. But since you're on a budget you might be doing the sandwich box thing which would make taking the packs out a lot easier.  

So you have a few options.
```

## \#17 Posted by: Kaly Posted at: 2016-04-08T19:16:11.835Z Reads: 161

Depending on your weight you can go with 3 packs for a 12S and you'll have better range and will stress less your components.

True, since taking it on a plane is no longer an option, having to stay under 99WH isn't necessary. May as well crank it up a bit for only a few more bucks if the ESC can handle it.

Hi guys @longhairedboy @Kaly @barajabali @cmatson

I finally decided to buy the Carvon Single HUB motor kit. But now I was cheking about the batteries again.

How much range would I get with 2 x http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__21404__ZIPPY_Compact_3300mAh_4S_35C_Lipo_Pack.html ?

Hobbyking ships to Argentina, so I'm really happy!

## \#20 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2016-04-11T16:06:42.781Z Reads: 155

at 97 watt hours depending on your weight you're looking at 4 to 6 miles max.

Even if I play with the VESC to reduce top speed to 15mph and reduce other things (I have NO idea about programming a vesc). Will I get more?
```

---
## \#23 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2016-04-11T16:52:46.150Z Reads: 137

```
You'll get 4 to 6 miles out of it at a casual cruising speed no greater than 15mph. Go faster you'll get less, go slower you'll get more. But you won't see more than 6 miles out of 97 watt hours i promise. 

Its all about the watt hours. For me personally, every dollar i spend after drive train and ESC goes into watt hours. The more i can cram under my deck the better, and if i can do so at a higher voltage i will when i can.

```

---
## \#25 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2016-04-11T17:01:15.256Z Reads: 139

```
Then you'll have a 12S system and you'll be able to drain the whole thing even quicker! but if you stay around the 15mph mark you'll see an increase in range by about 2 miles or so. You're still at only 146 ish watt hours though.  9 miles max if riding like grandma, but probably around 6 or 7 miles total at fun speed.
```

What a ridiculous limitation. Maybe you could just order them separately over a two or three day period. 

OR... 

http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__9513__Turnigy_4000mAh_6S_30C_Lipo_Pack.html

two of those would get you roughly 177 watt hours in series at 12S. and its still at $100. 

Are you starting to see the formula for picking packs within a given price range now?

Update: I'm getting this VESC product/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/
And this remote product/torqueboards-2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller/

This is what I designed so far, I know is not much. I need some help regarding wiring, connectors required (XT-60 M/F, XT-90 M/F) and the most important thing, how will I charge it all? I want to charge the three batteries at the same time, if possible and what do I need?

There are at least two options for charging them all at the same time. 

1) Wiring the packs in series and correctly combining the balance leads into a 12S balance lead (i've never done that before, but theoretically it should work) and using a 12S balance charger or 

2) use a parallel charging board to charge all three packs at once after you disconnect them from the each other as well as the ESC since you can't charge packs wired in series in parallel, or so i've seen and have been told. Bad things happen. 

3)If you have room in your box,  take option 1 and instead of buying a balance charger you could buy a 12S BMS and dedicated 12S charger to make charging super simple, and it wold probably cost a little less than a separate balance charger.

If you are going with the Lipo do not use a bms with them better get a Lipo saver and that will be better. 

To charge the loops I recommend the icharger 3010b.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B005X047C4/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1460480818&sr=8-1&pi=SX200_QL40&keywords=icharger+3010b&dpPl=1&dpID=414lzAgNlrL&ref=plSrch

This is an excellent option and will be useful for the future when you decide to upgrade. 

You will need a power source, this power supply ( 2z0-Rc) is one of the best option because is modular and you can scale up or down depending on your needs. http://www.2zo-rc.com

If your concern is budged you can go with a space cell or any other battery that is ready made the only negative side of this route is that you do not have option to scale if is needed in the future.

Hey Guys,

It includes all values you need to think of to calculate the real-world speed and range of your board. 
For example air or frictional resistance. And the important things are written in english too.

Battery arrived! I'm waiting for the Space Cell Enclosure and some XT-60's (since my plan was buying the Space Cell Pro3 with XT-60's and bought my VESC with XT-60's as well). Just replacing the XT-90 battery side and I'm ready to go!

Holy shit I'm fucked, Dexter's 10S3P was supposed to fit into Space Cell Enclosure, but there's some problem with that left edge, next to the cables going out, it's wider than the rest of the battery.

Any advises? I think i'll just have to rip the pack away. Anyways, I have to make some cutouts for the power button, charging port and lcd probably.

I'm working on a 545mm x 150mm x 30mm enclosure which will fit a pack + ESCs.

@torqueboards 

Is there any way to mount the On/Off Switch and the Charging Port Directly to the Enclosure without opening all the pack?

Are my VESC settings right? Would you guys change anything? 

**Current Setup**: Single CarvON v2 HUB, Torqueboards 10s3p Pack, Ollin VESC and Mini Remote Controler.

Advanced > Max current ramp step is set to 40

I would set it back to 0.04 before it rises again, there's a bug on BLDC tool that when you write/read configs it goes x10, make sure you put it back to 0.04 before you do more write/reads and before you ride :slight_smile:
