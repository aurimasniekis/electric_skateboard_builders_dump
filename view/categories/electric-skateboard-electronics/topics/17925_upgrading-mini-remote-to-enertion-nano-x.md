I been running my board for eight months now with a finger trigger remote, the first one was the Evolve remote and the second one the mini remote, I can't stop praising the mini remote, it has been amazing in terms of butterness, adjustment, immediate pairing, extremely long battery life, it just had a few  disadvantages as a toyish on/off switch and bad battery springs, things that are very easy to fix BTW. 

So today I change my mini remote for there and the Enertion Nano X, it immediately paired, I adjusted the PPM limits and went for a test ride, the board was too powerful on low rpms, maybe I'm not used to a thumb trigger but riding on this remote was very awkward, I almost fall a couple of times, I definitely lost low speed control. 

There's a switch to change modes, I don't know how it works, I don't know if I need to adjust something else but so far I'm not liking it more than my Mini Remote

As far as I'm concerned the mini RC remote is the best skate remote ever!
Similar experience, I tried the nano remote but quickly went back to the Mini.

If it just had an pushbutton on/off switch a screen with odometer and speed, a smaller enclosure a safety tope holder and a trigger guard it'll be perfect

LoL, if it had all that, you wouldn't be able to get them for $30
A screen with battery gauge would be nice, but then you would need a bms with communication circuit.

I'd gladly pay us$ 100 for a remote like this

BTW where do you get it from for us$ 30?

They're out of stock at the moment but getting more by the end of the month. They deliver quickly as well.

I really really do like the Nano-X, in particular because you **can switch on-the-go between the two modes**. Usually, I ride the board using the low-power mode, however, when extra power is needed (e.g. steep hill) I switch to the boost mode. Overall I am quite happy and had no drop outs whats-o-ever.

Glad to hear!
Some prefer trigger and some prefer thumb control.
There needs to be good remotes available to suit everyone's personal preference.

Absolutely, I would love to have one of these modded GT2B remotes. Just sold my GT2E which was great but a bit too large for my taste.

Im still yet to find a remote that beats the nyko kama in terms of rideability.  Perpetual steez ftw.

That's a Nano remote. Lots of people have already tried those, myself included.
And Frankly, I wasn't impressed with anything about it except its size.
As for reliability, long battery life, smooth operation and ergonomic comfort, I'll stick with the larger Mini RC remote

The mini remotes were available on banggood. I could have picked one up for $23 Canadian and free shipping (30-45 days). It would seem the cat is out of the bag though. Stock problems. Remember not to share until you buy your own first :) Probably coming to a reseller near you. Thankfully I don't need one.

It seems it is possible to make 2 or more ride modes for other remotes, too!

It seems there just needs to be a resistor in line with the potentiometer! You make this by wiring a switch and making a parallel connections to the pot.. For the ''parallel'' connection, you add resistors, which increase the resistance value..thus decreasing the ''sensitivity'' and max output of the remote.

How can you switch modes on the Nano X? Can you switch between two presetted modes or does it just restrict the trigger travel?

I agree with Namasaki. The Mini RC is a very reliable remote that gives you a nice accel range on the trigger. It fits really well in my hand, and I've never been bothered by the size. I have no reason to switch to a Nano, nor do I want thumb control.

The switch from my Mini Remote just broke, has anyone got any way around this problem?

I'd like to upgrade the switch with a push button switch, what would be the smallest one compatible with the motherboard?

As far I understood it just restricts the pulse width, hence trigger level??? Not 100% sure about that.

I've been using Mini RC remotes for over a year and have never experience the battery springs getting loose.
Guess if your having that issue, you just grab the end of the spring with needle nose pliers and pull on it to lengthen the spring a little.
BTW, if you put AA Lithium batteries in they should last at least 6 months if you ride every day.
Mine lasted almost a year and then I changed them before they ran out.

My "spring" ie metal tab, compressed when I dropped the remote from chest high. It  snapped in half when I went to fix it.  
Can't remember what I soldered on there for temp fix - just looking for another solution.

Actually, I can send you the whole half shell with battery compartment. You just pay for shipping.

The switch mounts to the circuit board. I have a spare switch I can send you if you want to replace the broken one

Thanks for the offer my friend. Shipping to Peru is going to take a while. 

I'm thinking about upgrading the power switch with a tougher one that I could source locally, maybe a push button switch.

It's probably doable with a remote switch with wires to the pcb

I had the Nano/Winning remote. Loved the size and thumb control but I had disconnect issues like many others. Usually when I ride it denser populated streets. I'm currently using the Mini. I really like it especially after hacking off the steering control wheel control, the great battery life is awesome. I have a Nano-X that still hasn't been used because frankly I grew tired of unscrewing the case. I'll get to it eventually.

I think the problem with the Nano is it's receiver. 
For one thing it hasn't got an external antenna if my memory is correct

@Namasaki I like to throw my body and arms around when I skate.  I find that a lot of the controllers with triggers and thumb controls have me gently trying to hold the throttle in one position for extended periods of time. it makes it hard for me to aggressively throw myself into a hard carve or something.. i feel like I'm concentrating too much on throttle and I lose the free-form that is skating. 
also a lot of my friends are noobie skaters and its much easier for them to accelerate slowly and smoothly with the kama.
thats what I mean by "rideability"

I have tried so many different controllers and always go back to the Kama. its the best as far as I'm concerned.

I made an adjustment to the throttle curve on my nano x and it'd runing much better instead of 25-50-75% I switched to 10-25-50, you guys should try that setup

I agree with @Namasaki in the end it's a preference.  Kinda like the whole Android vs Apple battle.  I've had both the Miami Electric (Benchwheel) Remote and the Nano-X from Enertion.  The throttle curve on both are a bit sensative IMO.  But it's something I've gotten used to.  I've used @KlethBane's Mini Remote which he's had used on all three of his builds.  I respect his opinion so I gave it a go and really didn't enjoy the experience.  I think for now, I'll stick with the thumb throttle.  Maybe give it some more time to get used to.  Good luck :wink:

You should give my firmware mod a try because you can fine tune the throttle curve of the remote to your needs.
