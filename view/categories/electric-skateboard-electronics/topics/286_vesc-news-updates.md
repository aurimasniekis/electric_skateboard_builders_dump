The Current Enertion VESC order has been halted. We are discarding the v4.8 PCB and now producing v4.10 

No extra charge to the customers.

All pre-orders will be getting the latest v4.10.

Unfortunately this will delay shipping until mid October.

Do you mind posting the change log from one version to the other?

Sorry Don't have it. Check vedder.se or maybe github.

I think most of the latest changes had something to do with current sensing accuracy.

Just for information purposes, from git

HW4.8: better shunt routing, extra pin on comm connector, footprint fixed, zone fixes, many other improvements

HW 4.9: shorter shunt traces, HW SPI

HW4.10: Connected HW SPI NSS pin and moved temperature pin for that
