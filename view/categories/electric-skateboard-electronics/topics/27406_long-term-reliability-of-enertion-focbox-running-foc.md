I'm about to start a build using 2 FOCBOXs (bought when they were still VESC-X) and I intend to run FOC. I'll be using a 10s3p pack and dual 190kv 6355 motors and limit current at 40A (20A each). I've searched the forum and there's not much info on people running FOC with Enertion's FOCBOX. I'm hoping experiences will have been positive. I mean, FOC is in the name of the product!

So can you chime in with your experience running FOC on Enertion, both good and bad?

No bad only goodd the vesc x has been perfect in foc in 10s

ill let you know my focbox's should come sometime next week to replace my old enertion vesc's, i have a raptor dual which is identical to your build, i want to try FOC mode too.

I'll follow for sure.

Thing **you all need to note is KV of motor?**  Lower KV like hubs definitely is an advantage.

I just setup my first FOC setup on 149kv 8s (might eventually go 10 or 12s).

Love the silence!

I've heard from a couple people that it's "FOC-proof" and has a transistor that shuts off before anything can burn the DRV, but I'm not sure about that claim.

I had an issue yesterday, one Focbox could not make motor detection and threw an ABS overcurrent fault. So instead of burning the DRV or shunts some audible "clack" noise maybe some kind of thermoswitch activated and prevented the Focbox from frying. 

This happened while runing as well. At the end the issue was a faulty Focbox, but just to confirm there was indeed some kind of protection that saved the DRV

nice to know, though still sucks that it can potentially shut off mid ride, but I guess it's good for people to see if they can even run FOC on their setup.

Well, this protection is nice but yesterday I had a fucking scary nightmare, when I went to test the board, I gave it full throttle and the protection activated, this caused one motor to kept spinning for 3 seconds, it pushed me sideways, even though I left the throttle go, almost loose control buy fortunately was able to save it.

Nothing is more scary than being riding a board at full speed and not only loose your brakes but lock one motor at full throttle for the longest 3 seconds of your life

Wow that's crazy and seems like a huge design flaw. VESC should never lock at full duty cycle... I've seen some crappy remotes do that, but haven't heard of the VESC doing that. What remote were you using?

I was using a mini remote, but that was not the issue I can definitely confirm the bad FOCBOX  locked on full throttle, I also replicated that on the bench. 

After replacing the Focbox with a spare one the lock didn't happen anymore

It seems that @Eboosted had a faulty FOCBOX; so hopefully it was a manufacturing glitch and not a design flaw inherent in the product. Is that your impression @Eboosted ?

I suspect that FOC reliability is heavily tied to eRPM, which would be why people running FOC on hubs don't have any issues. At 10s w/190kv motors you're running at about 45-50k eRPM after inefficiencies. 

I wonder if I'll counter problems when approaching 60k on my 230kv 10s board. I hit about 55-57k erpm on this setup.

Look at the problem, I think it might just be a bad connection over the PPM connector, It migt be that the pin are a little bit shorter, or it could be some oxydation, creating a bad connection inside the connector.

The only time I got these kind of behaviour was cause by a cheap cervo cable, the connector was to tall to reach the pins for a good connection.

What is erpm vs. Rpm ? I run a 270kv motor on 6s. How many erpm's is that ? I have the default max erpm value 100.000 in bldc, should i change that ?

You can estimate your ERPM w/ a calculator like esk8.it

Also see:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/search?q=ERPM

TONS of info on this - good to know before you fry a VESC.

And if you don't have a VESC/FOCBOX/ etc. - the 60k erpm limit should not apply.

That is a little risky, but it can be done. You will be very close to 60k ermp after inefficiences, and maybe over too..

I thought the focbox had a mechanical measure to protect the drv chip from frying?

@Enrico this has been discussed a few times bro, try doing a search & a bit more research, thing is most of the time the motor you buy is not the kv you think, it will be under... so the reality of practice is that even going over erpm by a small amount will not cause any problem. So again I suggest you do a bit more research before you give up to make a informed decision.

Been on the same VESC-Xs since before all the focbox nonsense. We haul ass all over. 12S, 190KV. 

Also We've been running 13S on them on 190kv motors on MBS 100mm wheels for about a month and a half using an old Tronik sled. That clunky shit is killing it at over 40mph. Not dead yet. 

They seem legit.  just sayin'

I think my FOXBOX croaked the other day while running 190kv at 12s in FOC. I had done well over 200 miles on it so I thought it was solid. I went on a medium hilly 7 mile ride with no problems but got all sorts of [**weird data**](https://metr.at/r/kAR74) from it with crazy high current readings. 

When I went to use it in the morning [**this is all it did**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XoI1hMME-ucAQzeabuEeZIuDd00gxP17/view?usp=sharing). When I pull the throttle the motor clicks and the VESC resets because of an over current fault (using metr). Its not showing up in BLDC_Tool but I can access and change settings with perimetr.

You could raise the battery max current up to 50A, 37.5A if you want to be inside manufacturer specs, but the 30Qs have proven to be a very good 20A cell.

Ive run 70, 80, 110, 130, 149, and 170kv motors/hubs/direct drives at 12S and FOC on the FOC box(some were VESC-X) without any issues I believe were related to the voltage or FOC mode over the last year. 

Ive had 1 FOC failure at 12S on a TB VESC but to be fair I had very high motor Amp settings on that VESC (120A).

same thing, just different name due to Trampa registered the word VESC.

My understanding is that early Vesc-x were not as well manufactured as newer ones. factories have changed in order to get better QC.

I was runing focbox on foc 10s on my ebike. I did 250 km or so with it in the past month. The other day I got going (192 kv motor spinning 500-1000 rpm)  turn on the vesc  twist the throttle all it did was jerk and started to resist movement. On further inspection it appears I blew one of the direct fets. Probably my fault for freewheeling.
