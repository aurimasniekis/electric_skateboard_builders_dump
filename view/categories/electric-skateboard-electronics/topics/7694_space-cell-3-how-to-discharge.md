Having an issue with my board where I don't get any brakes when it's charged above 90%. Problem is that I accidentally left it charging too long and it's now at 100% at which point not only do my brakes stop working, my motor does too. Remote connects okay, but I won't get any response from my VESC until I'm able to discharge my battery a few percentage points. 

Anyone have any ideas on an alternate method to discharging your Space Cell Battery?

I just put it at the recommended settings.

Have it set at: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/81a9c94c241ef4080a4c0840a63385767ec6fc8f.png" width="455" height="126">

Thanks for the tip! I upped the batt max by 0.2v just to get my motor running and I'm all good!
