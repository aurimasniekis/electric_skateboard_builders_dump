Yes. You can learn all of this by reading all of the pinned subjects at the top of this forum. The search function is also very useful. Help us help you.

Sorry guy, but voltage and everything is far too broad.  As psychotiller suggested - start reading.  I'd also suggest some intro videos on Youtube to understand the fundamentals.

This is far too broad to spoon feed you.  I get you are 15 and am not knocking - you just don't know enough to ask intelligent questions we could help you with.

read read and read some more.

I just turned 16 last month and finished my first eboard almost half a year ago (started in July 2016). I spent hours uppon hours reading about motors, batteries and al the complicated things around it. To be honest i still understand almost nothing, just the basics altho i learned alot about electricity at school last year (i still dont understand it). I'm just waiting to have this click in my head when everythings just fallds together. I had this when i was learning how to build an ebaord. I didnt know what parts i needed and where to get them so i just hung out at this forum spending hours just reading. Now i know everything about the different parts and stuff. be patient and watch youtube videos, read this forum... And over time everything will get more clear. Just start learning!

Are you looking to learn electronics in general or are you asking about skateboards parts specifically?

I'd suggest searching elsewhere for that information, like khan academy for instance. They usually explain in a really good way and start from the basics.  But there are of course other great sources as well.

I started working on a wiki for ESK8 related stuff. Most of it is unfinished but the definitions section has an explanation for each of the variables you'll see discussed on this forum.

Check it out at http://esk8.wiki/index.php/Definitions

The easiest way to explain it is like a bucket of water with a hole in it.
The hight of the bucket is Potential (Volts)
The flow of water out the hole is current (Amps) 
The size of the hole is resistance (ohms)

And you could say the size of the bucket is battery mAh. But thats another story...

The same time ur taking to ask the question could be spent using ur google search button, this is the basics in a physics class.

*cringe* I understand that we are people of all ages here. But somehow, people talking like makes me just walk out of the room.

ANYWAY, here's your answer to Joule and Colomb  http://bfy.tw/DFIE

Doesn't they teach these in your school? I was 13 (10 years ago) when we did study these basic things in physics.

Seriously though. No matter what your teacher does or does not do, rule one in this world, but also on this forum is ; at least try to be nice and respectful if you want pple to help and answer your questions. Sorry for slipping a bit off topic here, but no matter your age or whatnot, that tone doesn't belong here or anywhere else for that matter. 10 char. lol

Yep you have to be active by yorself if your teacher isn't. Try to look at youtube videos and read a lot.

s)

And you could say the s

But doesn't how much amps get pushed thru depend on how strong the voltage is?

@Proxy 
the Amps is dependant on both the voltage and the load.
a higher voltage will result in more Amps at the same load.
