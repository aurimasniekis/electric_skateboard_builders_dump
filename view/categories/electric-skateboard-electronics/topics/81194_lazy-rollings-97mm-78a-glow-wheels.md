Looks Pretty Cool. Defiantly something I would put on my Orca for night time riding if the formula feels good.

Looks like the wider version of the hub spokes. 
Most my press fit pullys don't fit those without a bit of work.....
i really want these. I mainly ride at night.

Evolve pulleys fit on theese wheels with no mods according to their Instagram. They look sweet with that reflection , great for night riding. 👍
They will retail for 136€ according to a Facebook post on the public Swedish esk8 community fb page.

Looks like regular ABEC Pulleys will work: 

> GLOW by LAZYROLLING 
> Longboard wheels
> Size: 97mm
> Width: 50mm
> Durometer: 78A
> Bearing Seat: Centerset
> Rebound: 90%
> 
> Super Grippy wheels, yet soft enough not to chip!
> 
> Features gently bevelled reflective sidewalls, perfect for all belt electric skateboards. The GLOW is visible up to 125 meters / 410 ft in the dark!
> **The hub is compatible with evolve and abec original wheel pulleys.**
**Note: is not compatible with clone core wheel pulleys.**

I'm just worried about it being a bad formula.
