Hi
This is my first build that I'm doing as a college project and I'm using a dual 190Kv 6355 motor set up using two Vesc 4.12s that I brought the PCBs and then fitted the components myself. I'm planning to use it with a 10s4p battery pack (https://eskating.eu/product/10s4p-eskating-electric-skateboard-battery-samsung-30q/) 
But I can't figure out a wiring diagram/circuit diagram for the complete system. The battery that I plan to get includes a BMS, Enclosure, Battery percentage display, charging port, Charger and XT90 connector already connected. I've got a DIYelectronics Nano remote and receiver as well.

I've tried searching for the last week and I can't find much that explains it well and what connectors are used for a dual Vesc set up.

Any help would be appriciated, Thanks
