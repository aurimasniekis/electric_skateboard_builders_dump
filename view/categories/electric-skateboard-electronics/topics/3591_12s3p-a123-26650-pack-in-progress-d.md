The pack only needs to be charged to 43.2v (3.6 x 12) not 43.8 (That is for 3.65 lifepo4 cells) Not sure if this is correct. Please advise me why if it isn't correct.

The over discharge protection of this bms is too low for the A123 cells (2.1 ¬± 0.05 V) you will need to monitor this with the VESC low cut off voltage at start 2.6V and finish at 2.5V.

@lox897 you are correct on this

@L3thaltank can you please measure the dimension of the pcb itself and the aluminium heat sink.

I have found that the Maximum allowable charge voltage is: 4.2V MAX

so i should be fine charging to 3.65V per cell vs 3.6V.

This will greatly diminish the life of the pack. 
Tesla goes from 3.6V to 2.5V and it increases the life of the pack. 

This is the manufacturer pdf. http://a123batteries.com/v/vspfiles/images/pdf/26650.pdf

Why do you think it will greatly diminish the life of the pack? Charging to 3.65V per cell? or discharging to 2.0V?

Can you show me some examples explaining their voltage cutoffs for these cells? 

Why would they state a recommended cutoff of 2.0V? 

What cutoff do you use with your dual 6s alarms?

[/quote]

laboratory settings are not the same as real world use.  A great number of people are using this cells for other applications and all the charge/discharge logging point to the sweet spot of 3.6V - 2.5V range to increase the life of the pack. The over charge will not be as detrimental compare to the over discharge but will affect too. 

About the examples, all power tools using this batteries cut the discharge at/or around 2.5V.

[/quote]

That's the laboratory setting cut off for marketing porpoises. It can be use but not recommend. If you look closely to the 2 top graphics on the pdf you'll notice on the left side voltage axis. that the initial voltage drops in a exponential way (really really fast) wich means that there's not that much usable capacity in that voltage range. 

The bulk of the usable capacity is in the nominal voltage range. Going now to the right side of the first graph after the 2.5V on the 140W - 180W usage range the discharge curve drops exponentially again wich translate once more in little usable capacity after this voltage range. 

The alarm in my pack, I just use as a volt meter just to check the voltage, this alarms just go as low as 2.7V so I don't use the alarm :-( , I have confirm that from 2.8 - 2.5 the pack still have 30% of the capacity. 

This is the main issue with the lifepo4 cells that there's no way to know the depth of discharge, because of the flat discharge curve and the exponential way in wich the capacity finishes. 

But if you are going to use a VESC to manage the cut off voltage just use 31.2 V for the start voltage cut off and 30V for the end voltage cut off. That way your bms will handle the charging and VESC the discharging.

Thanks for your input! :smiley:
I'm using dual TorqueBoards 12S 120A Car ESC  so i might be able to set a correct voltage cutoff, but might not. I need to check the settings.

I eventually plan on investing in 2 VESC sometime down the road as I just spent a bunch of money on this pack and a Hi5ber Raptor that I ordered :grinning: http://www.hi5ber.com/#!raptor/ca1y

I decided the sleds I purchased would be too much of a pain to make them work,especially since I would have to remove the tabs to solder them and then snap them back into place in the plastic holder. Also reading about nickel strip sizing given amperage I decided It would be more reliable to directly solder the cells. 

I used 10AWG silicone wire, some turnigy and some superworm.

Yea... it wasn't cheap 36 cells at $9.30 each plus $20 for shipping. I originally was going 2p with 24 cells but bumped up to 3p so I ended up paying $40 shipping for 2 orders and $335 for cells. 

Yes boosted version one uses 12 of these cells. I'm not sure what version 2 uses... people have said lipo but I'm not sure. 

I mainly went with these cells for their cycle life. After calculating costs of building it myself, it made a lot more sense than investing in a space cell.

Holy crap that is a lot.... but these are definitely the best cells to use for an electric skateboard. 

I'm almost sure v2 is using an 18650 10S2P pack of some 2500mAh batteries. That would fit their 199Wh rating. Also Boosted despises Lipos since they were a failure on their first few concepts.

Nice. Personally, I was thinking of a a123 12s1p or 12s2p Samsung 25R pack. Can't decide. Both fit on my board, just one has longer life span and one has a greater capacity. I'm just using this board for fun and small trips so it doesn't really matter to me.

I have use this product and That shrink wrap will need a lot of heat and the rubber will keep that heat and transfer it to the battery pack. 
For you not to heat the battery too much, it will be good to place the pack on a damp wet towel, use you heat gun on the shrink wrap and  turn the heated side of the pack on to the towel. That way the heat will be absorb by the water in the towel and not you new battery pack.

What's the difference between using 10awg wire and nickel strips? Almost all of the diy battery packs are build with nickel strips. 
Also, is there a difference if you connect each individual cells of one parallel pack with each cell of the next pack or like you did, just connect the last cell with the first cell of the pack?

what was the overall length once wrapped?  Simple math says it's no less than 468mm/18.6in, but with the cell spacers maybe a bit more?

The ampere rating between nickel strips (approx. 15A, depending on the nickel strip size) and awg10 wire (more than 55A continuous for silicon wires) is quite different, at least for the serial connections you might need something more than nickel strips.

If you're talking about 18650 Li-Ion cells, then 10*3*3,6V*2,5Ah = 270Wh (compared to 3*12*3,3V*2,5Ah = 297Wh for 12S3P A123, so the range difference shouldn't be too big; a 10% difference). However keep in mind that A123's will last a longer (in terms of cycles) and can output more amps (and will probably have less voltage sag in this configuration) but it is a lot bulkier.

Any news on this pack? I'm going to build one too, as soon as I get the cells and am wondering about what BMS to use. Does anybody have a recommendation for a a123 12s3p pack with the correct charging protection voltage and amperage? For discharging, I am planning to use the VESC, in order not to worry about expensive BMS or a power bottleneck. Although, I guess a 120A would do for a two motor setup which are rated to 50A max peak each. I hope the VESCs have a good reputation concerning undercharging protection.

The alarm in my pack, I just use as a volt meter just to check the voltage, this alarms just go as low as 2.7V so I don't use the alarm :frowning: , I have confirm that from 2.8 - 2.5 the pack still have 30% of the capacity.

This is most excellent, I haven't ran my pack down to vesc cutoff yet. I have it set to 2.8 and 2.7. So there is even more in it. I'm using a self built 8s3p A123 pack. So far according to the metr app the last run I did was 14+kms and I'm still sitting at 3.2v per cell.i honestly thought something was wrong. When I have time I'm going to try and drain the pack. 

So 8s3p A123 is 198 wh as far as I know. I have the same BMS shown above, but its the 80 amp version. It say it balances for 3.5v per cell which is 28v. How much capacity am I losing by not getting to 3.6v? My gut tells me that i'm at or very near 95%.

These cells don't act like other cells like said above. Am I just running efficiently or am I missing something? I was calculating 198wh divided by 10 to get 19kms distance. It seems I could exceed that fairly well. The regen on this ride gave me 2km more worth of distance.
Something happened with the map part, but the distance and everything else seem right. Its a dual 230kv 16/40 97mm setup.

I can confirm running my pack right to 2.75 cutoff start and 2.6 cutoff end. I had to walk up a few hills but did small stretches on the flat. Ended pushing the rest of the way 1/2 km. I travelled 21.5km. Very happy about that.

Hey everyone, just wondering if I could use this BMS with the 26650 cells, thanks!

Yeah it works great. Everything is configurable. I use it for charge only. The only thing is the bluetooth module unfortunately has a bit of drain, would be smart to put a switch on its power line.

These units can be reconfigured for up to 16s by bridging or unbridging some solder pads and changing some settings.

Oh you should get the one for lifepo4. The units are the same but the settings will be good to go out of the box.

Awesome thanks for the help! Would I be able to charge with a 42v 2a power like in my 18650 pack?

Yeah it's excellent for charging slightly less than full as you can configure when and how it balances, and watch what it's doing.
