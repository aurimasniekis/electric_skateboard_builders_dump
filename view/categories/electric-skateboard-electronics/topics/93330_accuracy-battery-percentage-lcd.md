My battery indicator is showing 90% but my metr app shows 37%. I tried to see if i can calibrate/adjust settings with the buttons on the lcd but i can only switch it to voltage instead of a percentage using the left button on the lcd pcb. Cant find any manual on how to adjust it either. Does anyone know how to make the lcd battery % reading accurate? ![Screenshot_20190509-221058_metr|236x500](upload://yKuqF8mfKaHzcPR9evl3d355RLu.jpeg) ![20190509_221124|375x500](upload://zGirjamIAP4BtendXBfeH1okzRX.jpeg)

There's a button on the back of the meter, hold it down while powering on the board and then set it for the series count you have.

what @mmaner said. Although my Meter is still wrong because it uses the li-ion value instead of lipo. 

It shows about 50-55% but my charger at home states 26-28%~
