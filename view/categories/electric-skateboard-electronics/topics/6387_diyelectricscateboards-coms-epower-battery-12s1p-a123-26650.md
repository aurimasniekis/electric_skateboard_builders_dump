But the site says **12S1P** Does that mean they are just selling 12 26650 batteries at $299.00???

These are also the older generation of A123 cells with only 2300mAh capacity. This is definitely a built battery pack considering 12 cells costs around $150.

Just talked to them.

They are in a pack with a BMS but w/o an on/off switch (however future versions will have one.)
the dimensions are 30mmx150mmx308mm (1.2in x 6in x 12.2in)
