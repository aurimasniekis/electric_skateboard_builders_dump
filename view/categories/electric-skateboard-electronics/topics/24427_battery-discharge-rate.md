I am building my first board soon and just want to make sure I'm understanding battery stats correctly. I've got an opportunity to get a good deal on a 48v Li-ion battery which has a capacity of 30ah, and a discharge rate of 1c, which means I can discharge the battery safely at 30amps? Will this work for the build? Should I just stick to Lipo?

So that's a 13s10p~ battery? That sounds ridiculously big and heavy. Voltage may be too high for most ESCs as well. I'd personally opt for something smaller.. 30 amps for 10p~ isn't very efficient.
