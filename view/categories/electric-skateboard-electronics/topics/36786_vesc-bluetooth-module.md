Can i use any bluetooth module that is compatible with vesc and use the telemetry app (metr) or i must buy theirs,30 euro plus shipping is a lot for me,especially for bluetooth modules that cost 3$

You need the metr.at module to use the app (same for perimetr).
Every HM10 BT modules will work with other app (Ackmaniac or Emmaanuel).

Is there a 'hack' to use metr with cheap modules?

@rpasichnyk is doing an amazing job with his apps. I guess hundred of hours of coding.
So, no, no hack, just buy it ;)

You can also use your cheap HM 10 module with this app, App is paid but only 99cent - I think.

Allows you to use telemetry and change vesc settings. Works now with new 3.0 firmware and Ackmaniac 3.1 !!!

Metr.at only works with the metr modules as the modules Bluetooth Mac addresses are programmed into the software.

You can't.
It's not mac address but UUID.
UUIDs are defined by manufacturer and it's a read-only parameter.

If i could i wouldnt rip off a small developer from here,im not going to use the metr app but ackmaniac since the developer of metr protects the app in some way and its paid
