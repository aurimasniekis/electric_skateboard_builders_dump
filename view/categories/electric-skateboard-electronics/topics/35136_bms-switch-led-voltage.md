I encountered something today, that I had not with dozens of BMS prior to this, though most without LED.  The LED output which is supposed to be 12V was actually supplying battery voltage to the LED. I managed to spot the switch start melting a plastic bag it was laying on and turned it off.

Those with BMS with eswitch and LED have you checked the voltage being supplied to the LED?

It's from here, though I didn't get it there, this is supposedly the same model, though it looks slightly different

Hmm I did just notice the diagram there says "voltage level" , the diagram I got with it said "switch led"

I see it has connection for a switch and a battery meter.
did you connect an led where the battery meter goes?
