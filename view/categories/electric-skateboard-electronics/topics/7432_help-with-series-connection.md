I am planning on picking up 2x Zippy 4s 8000 mah batteries and configuring them in series. The issue I'm having is that i cannot find a series adapter/connector that is compatible. The batteries discharge plugs are 5.5mm bullet connectors. 
Does anyone know of a 5.5mm series adapter?

Do you have a soldering iron? If so, it's pretty easy to make your own.

It's that simple with 5.5 bullet connectors. 
You don't need an adapter for series. 
Only for parallel.

Really? What allows 5.5 mm to do this but not others?

It's not about allowing or disallowing. 
It's just the way there sold. 
You can get 4mm banana bullets in singles. 
The 4mm battery bullet battery connectors come with orange plastic covers. 
The 5mm come with blue covers. 
The 5.5 and up only come single with no covers.
