so by the time, I'll be assembling my skateboard I'll have about 20 Samsung 30q's
my question is what's the best way to wire them so I can get the best performance out of my Turnigy SK8 6374-192KV?

Together usually works best.

You should get 10 more cells and do 10s3p. Anything less is lackluster.

20s1p is usually the best way to go

```
As pointed out by @RedBaron
You really need more cells because a 10s2p isn't gonna do it.  
That's only 30a and 6ah.  
In my opinion, you should go at least 10s4p for 60a and 12ah
That would give you less voltage sag and a lot more range.
So 20 more cells.
