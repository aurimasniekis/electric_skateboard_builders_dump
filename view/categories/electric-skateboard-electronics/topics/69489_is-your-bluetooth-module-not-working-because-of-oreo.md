I was able to flash all of my HM-10 and its variants that no longer work on Android Oreo.

If you're not into doing it yourself, send them to me and I'll happily reflash them for you.  You pay for shipping back and forth.

Let me know.

yep, that's the video i used.  it tells you what to do, but not so much how to do it.

i'll post a video on it, found a technique that works pretty well.
