So I wasn't able to find any information here about this, but maybe I need to work on my google-fu. It seems like the charger is shorting out? When I plug the charger into the wall it lights up green like normal, but when I plug it into the board, the light turns off and the red light does not light. 

Now I admit I've given the battery pack a nice beating over the past year of riding it, but the internals all seem to be in order (unless one of my quick soldering jobs on those little leads is wrong somehow). Is it possible the charger is bad? 

Anyway, the battery pack is on 0% and it seems it will stay that way until further notice.

Check individual cell voltage and your balance leads
