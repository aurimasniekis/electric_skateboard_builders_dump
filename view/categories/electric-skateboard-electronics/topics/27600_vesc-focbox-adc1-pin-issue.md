Hey mates,
I am experiencing the same issue with vesc 4.12 and focbox which results in ADC1 pin always outputting ~3.2v meaning it gives full throttle both with and without connected hall sensored hardware throttle.
First it worked normally, but after hard braking (maybe no more than -15a) with belt slipping the controller started producing the described issue permanently. 
I don't know how to debug this, the pins looked fine on the pcb.
Any ideas?
