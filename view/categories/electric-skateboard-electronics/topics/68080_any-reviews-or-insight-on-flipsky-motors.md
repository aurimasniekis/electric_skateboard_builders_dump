I’m putting together my first build and was wondering if anyone here has tried the FLIPSKY motors. I’m looking to use 6355 190kV motors and FLIPSKY has them for $60. Are these motors going to last me awhile? If not what alternative motor brands would you recommend?

A lot of member recently bought it. They look identical to the one TB and other sell it. I believe they are good motors. You can do a search maybe they already posted something.

It's getting awfully annoying, but there are actually just a few motors out on the market that have all been rebranded. Look for identical motor sizes elsewhere and you will find the exact same motor with associated reviews.

They look like Maytechs.... If so, $75 for 6364 and $89 for 6374 is a great deal.

People charge up to $140 for 6374s and $130 for 6364s.  
I am not gonna lie, I have a cart full of $600 worth of Flipsky stuff, juat waiting on a few more VESC reviews of their 4.20 hardware...

I can vouch for Keda 195kv and 190kv motors. Just be aware that the 195kv are actually 6356 but hobbyking has mislabeled them as 5663.

Bang for ya buck wise they are insane, about $50 Aud a motor and they have plenty of torque

Aren't those the motors that had issues. A couple of forum members were selling them but no longer do. I think one issue was the shaft moving because m3 setscrew that you tighten with 1.5mm hex tool.

seems like a press fit since there are no obvious ports at the back for access to set screws.

Edit: Seems like there is a set screw. Zoom in on one of the pictures and you can kinda of see it in the port

Erm not sure if you and @Pedrodemio are talking to me or not but the Keda motors have two set screws holding the shaft and I assume they are held with red Loc-Tite as I was unable to loosen them with just a hex tool

I can say about the TB, rode my 6355 for about 2000 km so far, only think I hate is that they have a lot of openings, rocks enter all the time, also the bolts used are not good quality, more than once I broke off the head of the screws that hold the can to the shaft, same thing on both my TB 5055, other than that they are solid

but $90 for a motor is a bit expensive

If you look carefully, you can see that the motors I received are slightly different than the ones in the images on flipsky's website.
The rear doesn't have any venting holes, so perhaps more waterproof and less prone to rocks getting in.
You'll also see that the back part of the motor is flatter and less pronounced than the images online.
I don't think this a bad thing, just something I noticed when I received the motors.

My Flipsky motors, is having a very high freq. sound (listen to the start of the clip)..... And no, it`s not coming from the belt drive itself.... I have both 6374 150kv and 190kv flipsky motors, and it`s the same problem with all of them. Before i was using sk3 from hobbyking, they where running in silence.
I`m debating with flipsky at the moment, but i dont put my horses on that.

That's loose magnet sound... If you take bell of and try to put flat screwdriver under magnet or use pliers to pull it out (its stuck because its magnet) its loose and and higher speeds it starts to move and because of heat its magnetic force weakens and also starts rubbing to stator that's at least with 4 different motors I found out...

I think you are right. I'm talking with flipsky at the moment, both my 150 and 190kv have this damn Sound. I dont think they will do anything about it. So maybe i try taking out all the magnets, and glue them back in with loctite 648. Sometimes i also get "over current" fault in the vesc, that makes the motors brake out of nowhere.... I think this could be because of the magnets as well ???

@torqueboards has some good motors, been using them for years. @JLabs sealed can 6374s are bad ass too. 

The thing to realize is that most motors are not great when looking for perfection. The mostly all have something that isn't great about them.

I have tried 6380 haven't tried sealed ones but I guess the biggest issue in the first place is heat my motors stay at 50-60 degrees so it's not overheating but that much is enough to get most glue epoxy brittle or loose.

I have a video but the sound captured by phone but its nothing compared to the real one. But you can hear how motors making high pitch vibrating noise when accelerating its when magnets vibrate or jump off the bell to stator...

It now even overtakes the noise of inner gear drive...

I've not been very impressed with APS motors. I don't have a massive level of usage either, just the 2 types that I used weren't great. 

I would suggest you buy some Maytech motors and disassemble before you send them and apply Hugh temp ling cure epoxy to the magnets, let cure for 72 hours and then install. 

Seems like heat is most of your problem, mine rarely get over 34 degrees Celsius. 50-60 is really high.

Well, I bought two of their motors not that long ago.

One was DOA, making grinding noise and getting stuck.
They offered me 40% off to buy a new one.

After a few more emails exchanged, they promised they will send a new one.

The other one had a protective foil ( the transparent stuff you remove when unboxing it ) stuck in between two metal parts of the motor ( don't know exact terms for these, the outrunner with magnets and the part with vents ), I'm trying to figure out how to separate these and remove the foil.

They seriously need to improve their QA.

Nobody should consider buying them at this point.
The solder blobs can cause an internal short circuit, which will cause the motor to brake suddenly and has a high change of burning out your VESC/the enamel coating of the windings is compromised. The loose magnets would be a minor concern in comparison. 

These motors are dangerous/not suitable for ESK8.

@BarbaraZ. Please, consider discontinuing to sell these motors until your QA issues have been solved. You are putting people's lives at risk.

Well, at this point people should take into consideration the return and warranty policy of these resellers. I'm not saying APS delivers good motors at this point in time, but from stories listed here they at least refund 100% or send new motors. If that is incorrect, let us know. 

Loosing 40% of your cash because a reseller sends out faulty hardware is just ridiculous.

I will be getting 80100 maybe as they are much bigger they will not overheat with same currents as 6384/6374

I'm stuck with either going up to 6384/80 or going leopard 8072 due to the Jens drive, but I have had luck with the SK3 so far. Maybe my lower KV preference saved my ass until now. I think you prefer higher KV at 12s? High KV tends to generate more heat AFAIK.

How difficult would it be to tap new mounting holes into these big motors anyway?

Yeah....

To get a full refund , i had to send the faulty motors back. So flipsky could get a refund from their supplier. But it's pretty darn expensive to send a 2,5kg package from EU to China..... So they offered me a 60% discount online for two new motors, and told me, that i would receive new motors without faults (without solder balls and wrong glue for the magnets) but i dont trust these motors anymore.... So they agreed to refund med the 60% discount insted. 
I have sk8 6374 on the way now 😍 my sk3 have worked perfectly for over a year now. But i would love to have hall sensors

Getting a full refund for a faulty product should not even be a conversation you have. You bought something, its faulty, its their responsibility to supply what you paid for.

You need to be firmer. The idea that someone would keep 40% of my money after both wasting my time and sending me a hazardous product is beyond insane.

Yeah.... I know, they even startede with only 40% discount.  But normally you also return the faulty product, to get you money back. But due to the crazy high shipping cost back to China.... This would have been a even worse deal for me. This is what you get, when you buy from China i guess.

So I have a Flipsky 6374 but the temperature sensor isn't working. Can someone confirm that the sealed 6374 does have a temperature sensor. I really want to have my motor temps monitored and its driving me crazy that I can't get it to work. My resistance between ground and white on the sensor wires is in the mega ohms. Assuming they are using a 10K NTC, shouldn't the resistance be around 10 Kohms? If it's not too much trouble, can someone also confirm that for me?

As for solder balls, mine was clean. Here's some pics. Overall happy with the quality although haven't taken it for a spin yet.

I've been talking to flipsky tonight and they believed that the motors should contain 10k NCT thermistors. By the looks at it, they probably don't.

I have a solution that should would fairly well. Soldered a 10k resistor between the GND and temp on the PCB (see picture) and got 10k resistance on the wires.

Edit: Solution doesn't work. See next post. 

![20180922_042758|375x500](upload://4AeLmrkPsaHomHu2mnxFtWIJN2C.jpeg)

Replace the resistor with a small glass 10k NTC thermistor, tuck it between the winding and encase it in superglue. Should be a pretty easy fix.

Although.... For some reason VESC tool is reading -10c when the resistance is about 10kohms between ground and temp. Any ideas?

I can't really afford to buy a nice motor so I hope this one survives!

Well I have figured it out. Unfortunately doesn't look good. I measured the resistance between the red (5v) and white (temp) and was surprised to see 10kohms that varied with temperature. This 10kohms should be between black (GND) and white. So I did some investigating. 

I found a picture of the hall sensor PCB used on this motor online to see what the traces are doing. The picture I found didn't have a white wire soldered on or the 10k NTC soldered on. The flipsky PCB has both these soldered on. If you follow the traces, the thermistor is connected to the white wire and the red wire, but not the black. The above method of putting a thermistor between white and black unfortunately doesn't work because of the short circuit it makes between black and red (well between two thermistors). Here's a picture to reference:

A little too late for me now. But do you know if there is a way for the VESC to recognize the resistance with 5v as reference?

@JonathanLau1983
Already on it. The wires are epoxied pretty good, so cutting isn't really an option (didn't want to snip a winding by accident). I've been picking with an exacto blade under the microscope to disconnect the wire and will solder my own 10k NTC to ground shortly.

I've cut the wire in this picture already. Only the bottom half of the wire rubber is left and tinned the side I am going to solder my thermistor to.

Yup! As @Kug3lis said, it's enabled by default. Will begin to throttle power around 80c and shut the VESC down if it reaches 100c (or whatever you set these values as). Really nice feature if you're pushing the motor to its limits.

Another thing I want to do is add a thermistor on an 18650 cell in the battery to monitor those temperatures. The only things that will get hot in the board is the FETs, motor, and battery. If these three things can limit power to ensure they are within safe temps, it should be almost impossible to burn something up (well your chances are less likely). It would be nice to have the piece of mind that I can go up a really long steep hill and worst case scenary my board shuts itself off. 

Unfortunately it doesn't look like the software currently supports a third thermistor that will adjust the boards power. Plus I'd need to build a voltage divider.

Actually the app does show motor temps. If your temperatures are reasonable, it will display them. If they -100c or so, it assumes you don't have a sensor installed and doesn't display them. If you have large negative values, then sensor isn't connected properly. Do you have a Flipsky 6374?

If it's the same motor, you'll have to modify it to see temperatures (see my posts above). It does have a thermistor, but it's connected to 5v when it needs to be referenced to ground. Basically you need to cut the white white, and solder a 10k NTC thermistor between this white wire and the ground on the PCB. Some similar motors (same can appearance) don't even bother putting a temp wire on since they know it won't do anything.

Just got two of the 6354 in the mail, these ones have magnet retainers, so lets hope that they function a bit better. Temp sensor seems unchanged, everything is glued in, so I'm not gonna mess with that.!

No solder balls in the windings as far as I can see, so that is a good sign. I'm gonna see how they run when I have some time this weekend.

We have done some check ups on motors, and found out that its not epoxy breaking from temperature as it was holding up to 300ºC without braking but the motor can heats up and expands which causes epoxy break and loosen magnets, so the problem lies with motor cans and glue used as epoxy is not elastic and when motor can expands from heat it brakes epoxy bonds with magnets. So I guess more rugged motor cans work better as they do not expand too much.

It just explains that they were in a rush producing motors and removed it from the solder bath with enough speed to fling the liquid solder across areas where it should not be. In other words, not taking the time for the solder to become solid. Fixing this slows down production,  but other than that has no impact on the manufacturing cost. All multirotor motors have multistrand soft silicone wires and none of them suffer from solder balls,  nor would that ever be accepted. 

Using proper glue for the magnets however would increase the cost. That stuff is expensive. 
No word on improvement there.

If the motors don’t have shorting within the windings, that would show on a cheap inductance meter, (with the bell off), then solder balls not even a problem. I think it gets spit out if that solder pot with the introduction of the enamel on the magnet wire in there n not so much rushing that would make it shoot out of that solder pot.  
Be nice to know what crap glue they’re using 

Not that it’s their solution but if u have one of these u could add glue between magnets. Maybe crazy glue n baking powder

If the temp is high enough to burn away enamel it could pose an issue if they test motors for shorts at random to control batches. Also creates rough spots that could cause issues down the road due to minor movements of windings.

I also took my bad bell and spent some time repairing it  to a point where I'd be happy to ride it again. Designed and 3D printed a retainer ring out of ABS (there is a possibility of it melting but should work for normal use). Steaightend all the magnets and used a bunch of super glue to hold everything in place. Turned out well and will be a good backup.

I have not seen specific epoxy recommendations, but found this epoxy on Farnell, it appears to have all the desirable properties for glueing in loose magnets or battle hardening

"Some well-know eskateboard company and customers in the forum have been purchasing for two years and the quality is reliable."

from Flipsky post on motors - is this true? not quite what I get from this thread ... anyone think the "quality is reliable" yet?

I think they have finally switched to bells that include the retainer ring. For $89 (and usually they have 15% off sales quite often), plus free shipping, I think it's worth a try if you're on a budget. Maybe when you purchase the motors, specify in the order notes to ensure your motor comes with a retainer ring. 

I'm from Canada so to buy a motor from DIY Electric Skateboard is $120USD, plus $40USD shipping, plus the chance of duties, makes a 6374 well over $200 Canadian Pesos. Alternatively from Flipsky, I can get the motor for just over $100CAD since shipping is free and duties are rare (Chinese companies rarely declare accurately).

What we need is a sticky somewhere where motors are compared for durability and price, Ive spent a good few hours searching and this thread is the only recent one being updated. For people like me who are pulling their hair out with broken and loose magnets would be a good thing to quick reference! 

Ps what do you guys think durability-wise are the top motors? From what I can see Maytechs are pretty highly rated probably followed by Torque Boards?  

I’m steering towards maytech now @mmaner but they don’t really have a 190kv option in 6355 😔

That's just what I do, test gear.  The unsealed Maytechs are my favorite motors.  They are really smooth on rotation because of perfectly aligned magnets and and better than average shaft bearings.  They typically last longer because of this too.  In all honesty, I used to make fun of @sender for spending so much on motors and then I rode his "City Slicker" and saw the error of my ways.

That being said, they aren't better than BKB motors, just different.  @JLabs (BKB) motors are sealed so the 'feel' a bit different, but being sealed there is lot less debris that gets in the motor fouling your bearings.  The get hotter faster, but you would have to be bombing up a lot of hills and doing some heavy acceleration before you would see any effect.

Maytech posted a video of a new waterproof and dustproof motor on their youtube page. Basically using a sealed bearing as a seal, the same idea has been used to make gear drives waterproof. @Guz, maybe you want to consider that too.

@Guz one of our most recent batch we've had some that failed. We have a current production batch in which we've added an additional retainer clip and we've epoxied the entire motor can. So the new motors will be great. :smile: 

We'll also have some spare motor cans. You can replace your motor can for your other motors if you want. It will fit.

I don’t know what the actual motor size (stator) was in the old but the new is pretty small. I forget dimensions now and got rid of it.   Also has very little glue holding the windings. It does coast easily and while cogging isn’t necessarily an indication of power it seems to go hand in hand typically with out runners.  The phase wires seem stout and soft and look like they won’t short to the case. The machining tolerances weren’t good and close to a loose slide fit. . ![image|375x500](upload://xwgaVmnpS1lErBO3LCckPs271nu.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://1jxmlvQ4uat0OgrTmiT2flBOhDh.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://w2kcEkdifsU7X1HdFAg9tz4WXSZ.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://vEZMnMQKwkXNYCGVJw0Qt6OATj3.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://9p6KhrqCpPNEjH9PucdWdeHV5O7.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://gaHJpdaWLPKlSnFEoG9n0jziLxI.jpeg)

I bought two "BLDC Belt Motor 6354 190KV 2450W " for $60 each in Oct. 2018.  Just starting to ride them.  One started behaving erratically and I found that one of the hall effect sensor wires was broken inside the motor.  I theorize that the covering got nicked during assembly and the wire fatigued and failed while riding.

It's usually shifted magnets that causes that sound. It begins to vibrate at the resonance frequency of the motor since its now slightly out of balance.

When my flipsky magnets shifted, it made the exact same sound. Basically only at a certain RPM. I inserted a magnet ring (see above posts) and that fixed the problem.

As far as I am aware the 6355's are pretty decent, no worse than what other vendors are selling (likely identical) It's the 6374's that are terrible.

There's plenty of builds here on the forums using the 55's without many reports of failure.

Anecdotal evidence here, but I've had dual 6354's for about half a year now, with hundreds (at least 500) miles of tough riding (riding off curbs with rear mounted motors, rough terrain, etc) and they are still going strong. Slight play in the axle between the stator and can that allows for slight (less than 1mm) of movement along the axle, causes no issues other than a slight rattling sound when going over bumps.
