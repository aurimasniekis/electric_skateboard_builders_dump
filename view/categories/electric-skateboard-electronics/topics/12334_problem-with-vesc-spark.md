Soooooo
I connected my vesc to my lipo...
Without antispark...
There was a spark...
Now it is dead

Are there any parts of the vesc which typiccaly break if there was a spark? Anything that could ne broken that i can replace?

Sparks are not a problem to the vesc unless you wired it wrong polarity.

I mean, a spark at the plug when it gets connected, If you saw a spark inside the VESC its no good news. I read some units had problems with the pin connectors punching through the main wires insulation. Does anything look cooked on the board? Maybe some pics will help

Are you still using the same battery setup?http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/did-i-do-sth-wrong/8812

Since it produced already a spark in your old configuration it might be still causing problems.

You could use a 12V power supply.

I'd recommend d re-soldering your red cable to your vesc's main board, that join is really bad!

Man, this looks really bad.... you should try to stick with black for negative and red for positive... I can't even tell IF you have something reversed on that harness because of the color mess.

Who produced this VESC? No offense, but those joints are all really bad looking IMO... High heat, thick lead solder, and less than 2 seconds to touch and you should have beautiful joint. This looks like the soldering I did when I didn't know how to solder correctly.

That's the first time I see such a solder joint on one of our VESCs. 

Strange thing, but please PM me and we get that joint right and check, if it was causing that spark, which I doubt, since the battery looks a little bit strange too.

I think I am not going to resolder the joints myself but maybe ask somebody with more expreience to do it for me since I dont want to mess it up.

If you have a multimeter you can also check the can traceiver

So after some more checking i reslized that the pcb connection between the positive and the capacitors is broken so i am going to solder some bridges in place later

dude you just caused a german blackout! Now @elkick started an investigation who of his fellow german workers solders like that. Now everybody has to fill out a form where you have to put down exactly your workflow and after that a 23 hour speak about how someone dares to solder like that.

DonÂ´t mess with us Germans about our quality!
