>**_Questions I have that made me write this thread : ------------------------------------------------------------_**

1. I've seen batteries with upwards of 40 amps continuous discharge rate, is the battery I have listed good enough? It is of higher capacity and it seems to fit the build but who knows..

2. Are the LiPo batteries from HobbyKing **[LIKE THIS](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-3s1p-40c.html)** better than the option i've given? My option has an integrated charging solution and is a monoblock so thats a plus. 


3. Is this ESC good enough for the build? It somehow says 430w max which is next to nothing and the motors i've chosen are a total of 1200W. This is a lot of missed potential in my eyes. Is [**THIS**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dual-motors-longboard-skateboard-controller-with-remote-ESC-Substitute/302812941839?hash=item46810ece0f:m:mEjYlp9id5UtRAwhPmlchiw) a better ESC? Its an older, more unstable version, but it supports up to 2600W. The bummer is that the one listed in the parts list above is supposedly smoother and more reliable + has a better controller. Which one is better? I haven't seen anyone really talk about these newer ESC's (from the parts list above).

4. I read about the types of decks and i don't really know the terminology yet, but for a beginner, what deck should I seek? I read that flex is good, but having in mind the damaged roads, im guessing less flex would be better. Also, is a long board better for a person like me or something in the middle like a kicktail better for me? Any cheap shops in **Europe**? In the USA, blank boards cost 25-30$, here the cheapest ones go for 75$

>**_Conclusion : --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_**

> **_This is a post i was recommended but the battery solution is less... convenient. The trucks i cant use, the belt motors are good but less reliable (maybe???). The caliber trucks + motor mounts are the biggest issuue for me here. Also, the battery comes to about 22v._**

Building a board on a budget is really hard.
Especially if you want something that's going to last. I'm not saying it's impossible or trying to discourage you just letting you know.
One thing I will say is if you've got really rough roads Hub Motors are not the best option

WIth a budget that low just go for a meepo board

It’s not worth it trying to make that

Going over uneven roads on hubs is not nice

Battery amps is seriously low for that kind of board

Yep, get a meepo. They are actually decent on a budget.

Your parts list will work, sort of. But it'll be terrible every ride. At least with Meepo you get some community and company backing.

Yes go for a meepo or similar Chinese brand 

Reliable and if it gets messed up then you can get it sorted out

Save for a larger budget before starting to build a good nice board

The sad reality is that because prebuilt boards from Chinese companies source the components directly from China and make the boards in bulk, unless you buy everything on discount it is impossible to beat their value per buck.  If you have rough roads I would suggest using large wheels, either pneumatics or TB 110mm wheels, but that's 1/3rd your budget already.

Just because the average wage in your country is so low doesn't mean you can't be an exception and find oversees work / join an IT or other large, foreign business company. Smart people should always be earning above average :)

I do Computer Science. Of course everyone's skill differs, but I did a summer internship last year (after 1st year of uni) which then turned into a part time job for a few months and I learned far more than I have at uni so far. (So it's worth it both for experience and the extra cash that can be put into this hobby)

I highly recommend getting an internship while you're still at uni / living off your parents, because after uni you probably won't be willing to accept low paying internships, but without experience that's mostly all you're going to get I'm afraid.

If you like esk8 just wait till your budget is slightly higher and then build a decent build for $600 or so

It’s not worth going cheap. You just end up buying twice

The problem is that i don't even want to spend more than 400$. I am jobless rn and it isn't realistic here to buy an eskate for more than that. For me, spending 500$ on a prebuilt one is like spending 5k$ for an American (overestimated comparison, but not far from the truth). You can probably see why spending the equivalent of 5k$ is not great for a "cheap chinese board". It is what it is. I wondered if i could make something with a smaller lipo battery and a single belt motor but i guess not. Oh well, i haven't even ridden one so who knows, i might not have even liked it :/

Don't mind b264.  He knows his stuff but he builds for a different purpose than i expect you do. 
His esk8 are not toys but tools are must be reliable in all conditions 365.

I imagine your looking for a recreational esk8. Half toy half tool.

I don't see any esk8 at $300 lasting long sadly. I've seen people build minimum budget boards brake day one.  Then you end up spending money on same parts twice or sometimes more.

There is no need for free stuff. You will use them one day. We just live in different worlds and.. I guess eskate will be out of reach for people like me. I liked the idea of a board that gets me to places but i haven't ridden one. I wanted to make one and if i did not like it, i could've just sold it second hand as it is not really "a thing" here and are not readily available.

For the budget you have described and if you want a diy then maybe think about a kit.  Cheap and everything will work together seamlessly.  Most of the components you have listed are similar in comparison but this will take the headache out of the build process.

Or just lookout for used stuff..

As other have said, get a meepo. Those hubs and esc are extremely unreliable. The battery is almost guaranteed to be fake or made with atrocious cells. 


If you can save up another $150 you could build something decent.

At this budget, I would recommend a very nice unpowered, non-electric longboard.

Get one that's compatible with electric drive (and has enclosures available) and get some big wheels with kegel cores. (85mm to 90mm)

That way you could upgrade in the future if you wanted to.  But until then, you'll have a nice analog board.

I might as well go for the long stretch and get the 380 wowgo board. And then put in an extra 30$ for a 50% bigger battery. Oh well. Then if i do that 420$ stretch, i get some money to build one myself. Im guessing the wowgo s2 6.2 ah is pretty good though. I may not get a better performer than that that is lasting.

Thanks! Real appreciated. I will calcuate the cost and compare to the wowgo board and think if i should purchase a board or not.

Edit : Did some quick maths and it came to about 400$ (with shipping). Might as well buy a WowGo board. According to **[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDs_S3zRgSg)** video, it would seem that its a solid choice.

Edit 2 : @b264 I am.. A tech type of guy and not a skateboard kind of guy. From an eskate I am attracted to the "e" part and not the "skate" part. Hope that makes sense.

Edit 3 (Post limit) : @atenner its not only that. Its good enclosures (important positive) for the parts, warranty, deck. Where i live there are literally no deck options cheaper than 70e, even second hand.

Edit 4 (Post limit) : **[THIS](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/electric-booster-skateboard-carbon-fiber-3200w_60750898546.html?spm=a2700.7724838.2017115.187.135b3a61hLJszb)**  board costs about 400 with shipping. It has an android app which is cool, has somewhat of a better (looking at least) controller, 1000W double motors but there is literally not a single video of a similar board to this.

If you're just interested in building a board and having fun and are ok with the result not even actually working, (honestly this is kind of how I am somethimes) then I think you are on the right path. I kind of like to just experiment and try things and fiddle as I go. Honestly though if this is your main interest I'd recommend a smaller scale project like an rc-car or something since you have restricted disposable income. 

If you want an esk8 that works the best it possibly could for around $300 listen to the folks here and buy a pre-built. You make a lot of mistakes when building and theres a lot of small incidental expenses you don't think about as you integrate the big expensive components together. Couple screws here, roll of tape there, oh need to pick up some shrink wrap, just need to glue this down, oh that glue didn't work well I'll try this glue instead. It quickly pushes you over budget.

Yo if you want a board on a hell of a budget, check out [this instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Electric-Skateboard/). I found a used scooter on Craigslist for $50. I cut a deck out of plywood. Got some $10 grip tape. The front trucks were $30 and the wheels are $15 a piece. Only thing left is a battery. Plenty of room left in your budget for a decent battery if scooter one is bad. 

This was where I started: zero skating experience, decent tech/mech experience.

Why?  I know you don't like hubs and so does everyone who has ever had a conversation with you lol but thats not to say they don't serve a purpose in esk8.  Take the little meepo ones for example.
They have a surprising amount of torque when you can set the motor amps a bit higher.  Nothing is as light and easy to manage.  They make great little shopping trolleys.  Then theres hummies.  You know they are good.  So to blanket say that hubs are no good for diy is shortsighted at the very least especially as you to the best of my knowledge have ever owned a set.  Op's budget would only allow for very cheap belt drives and then well you know what they are like.

I would ask you what your goal is here?

Do you have a commute you need this for? Do you just want to build something for fun and learning?

As said before, $2500 is really the minimum to build a quality lasting eboard. The stuff we build around here are 5-10 times as powerful as a wowgo or any of these prebuilts and will take you 2-5 times as far on a single charge.

@rusins Your right about the internship. I fucked this up and when I got my CS degree, from a top 100 university in the US at that, and here in the heart of silicon valley, I can't get an internship or entry level job to save my life. I looked for over a year and ended up just working in another industry, which is frustrating cause I love computer science and I have a lot of talent and personal projects to show my passion/knowledge. Sadly, it's all about who you know, not what you know.

Because you can't change anything, without changing everything.  You don't even have 4 wheels or two trucks you can salvage.  You literally might as well just take the deck and battery and start over.

As said before, $2500 is really the minimum to build a quality lasting eboard.

You are looking at this from a very narrow perspective.  I'm saying you don't have to change the motors.  They perform admirably for most people especially when vesc controlled.  So for very little money in relation to normal re-purposing they are a cheap option.  2 vesc a switch, meter and a loopkey and you have a board that will out perform the pre-built it was based on in every way and to someone new to this those improvements would seem like night and day.  I've done it.  I know.
To turn it into something you would ride would be an expensive exercise but not everyone is you my tunnel visioned friend

I'd say roughly $1000 if I was a betting man and assuming not paying full retail price on all items (waiting for sales or buying new off someone else)

Well it depends on the power output you want and how you will use it and how many steeps hills you have and your weather ect.

When you look at a worst case scenario, yes, $2500 is around where you can over build a board to last.

If you are 120 lb and ride like a snail and are happy with that and don't ride in the rain and obly ride flat ground, then yes, $1000 is enough.

That's also assuming you know what you are doing and make zero mistakes, which is almost impossible for a new builder. You need at least an extra 20% for mistakes, and then also tools like soldering irons, hot glue guns, ect. Individually, these are mostly cheap, but it can add up to a $200-$300 in tools you need to build a proper eskate.

That's sad to hear, are you back to CS now at least?

I find it quite ironic that most companies don't even take 1st, 2nd, or even 3rd year students as interns because they want to train you to hire you as soon as you're done with your studies, yet won't take graduates as interns for god  knows what reason.

So what you're saying is that its completely subjective.  The figure of 2500 bucks is what you would need to build a board best suited to **your** needs?  Are you and @b264 related?   Seperated at birth maybe?  His love child?

No, I'm in the window covering industry, which I am ridiculously over qualified for. It's really really frustrating and I've given up on it for the time being. Either I'll go back and get a masters when I pay back my 120k debt, and retry my chance to get an internship (With more experience about the process this time), or just move on.

Companies really don't want to risk anything anymore, and the market is so over saturated. I applied to over 2000 entry level internships and jobs, without a single onsite interview. Hired a pricey career coach, which helped me get past the phone interviews, but a lot of times, they give difficult coding quizzes before even giving you a phone interview. I applied to start ups and medium/big companies. nothing really seemed to work. And the most annoying part is unlike at least half of techies, I have social and communication skills.

And with so many Indian and Chinese tech workers coming to the bay area from their respective countries, it's even more competitive (not to say I'm against them having the chance to succeed here, because I am happy that they do),

It's just a rough market and it;s not the "get your cs degree and you'll find a job" anymore. Many of my friends are still looking for work and the few that have found anything are doing scut like jobs.

Wow that's tough. You seem to be doing everything right, only advice I could give is moving to a different area, but that won't help with the 120k debt. (Although the UK might be a good match for high paying jobs + large demand for coders)

lol, we disagree pretty frequently. And he's not afraid to show it.

Do you buy a car that can only go on flat roads at a slow rate of acceleration? No hills or you'll stall.

If your constantly pushing your motors and batteries and belts to their limits, things will break and probably quickly. The ideal board is overbuilt for any situation, at least 2-3 times what you really need. You might get caught out in a quick rain shower... Should your board imploded in this case? A small hill, should you push your entire system to 75% of it's limit every time you go up a small hill? Have you never given your board to someone else to ride? Maybe they are bigger, and now will stress things more... This is beyond the potholes, crashing into curbs, ect. that you try to overbuild your board for. Obviously, you can't make something that won't break when a car runs over it, so it's not 100% bullet proof. But you can deal with a lot of fringe cases that cause failures.

Can you make a board work for most situations for $1000 that will last a year or so? Yes, but it won't be ready for any of the fringe cases I've mentioned so far.

You can make a nice lasting board for a little above $1000, but not how you think --

@evoheyax

 I could easily build a dual 6374 with focboxes or unity, 12s 5p battery with a quality deck and surf rodz trucks for under $2000 if I was based in the USA.

Wouldn't you consider that a quality build?

>Repost 

Edit 2 : b264 I am… A tech type of guy and not a skateboard kind of guy. From an eskate I am attracted to the “e” part and not the “skate” part. Hope that makes sense.

Edit 3 (Post limit) : atenner its not only that. Its good enclosures (important positive) for the parts, warranty, deck. Where i live there are literally no deck options cheaper than 70e, even second hand.

Edit 4 (Post limit) :  **[THIS](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/electric-booster-skateboard-carbon-fiber-3200w_60750898546.html?spm=a2700.7724838.2017115.187.135b3a61hLJszb)**  board costs about 400 with shipping. It has an android app which is cool, has somewhat of a better (looking at least) controller, 1000W double motors but there is literally not a single video of a similar board to this.
>  

I can basically get a wowboard from alibaba for about 350 with shipping, for the model that is 420 at wowgo. Except, i dont know if wowboard have changed anything though, probably not.  Exway X1 costs about 500$ from alibaba. There are also some other boards from alibaba that are kind of similar to the wowgo boards - like this : 

![image|500x500](upload://bx64DiQY0i7CfnBfzPwT5vUm1Vd.jpeg)  

I just don't know about shopping on alibaba. I've shopped many times on aliexpress but alibaba looks pretty shady to me.

* >I ordered the WowGo board with 6.4Ah battery. Thanks to everyone! I guess.. i can always resell it second hand if i feel like i don't need it/like it. I didnt really take it into consideration, but the 4Ah battery has 40a max discharge whilst the 6.4Ah battery one has a 20A max discharge. I dunno if i fkkd up.

Go to a company called yeeplay

Chinese company but actually not bad. I bought from them and the board was basically a nice meepo board with a much wider deck and basically the same everything else for just a bit cheaper
