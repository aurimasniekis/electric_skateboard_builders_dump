Hello world, hello guys!

I've been reading and watching a lot of videos and topics regarding e-longboards recently so i decided to give it a try as well :)

I'm looking for a help in order to verify if parts that i have chosen will be compatible with each other as well as for an advice from you guys and your opinion on that particular setup.

So.. without a further redo here's my setup which I plan to build:

Deck - omBBoards Infinity deck (https://www.longboardy.pl/sklep/decki/bombboards-infinity)
Wheels - Kegel 80mm 80a Orange (https://www.longboardshop.pl/pl/p/Orangatang-Kegel-80mm-80a-Orange/1801)
Bearings - ABEC9 (https://www.skatepro.com.pl/27-14044.htm)
Trucks - Turnigy Skateboard Conversion Kit Spare Parts - Truck Set (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/skateboard-fixing-part-set.html?___store=en_us)
Pulley etc - Turnigy Skateboard Conversion Kit Spare Parts - Pulley Set with Belt (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/gear-set-with-belt.html)
Motor - Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-245KV Brushless Outrunner Motor (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-245kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?___store=en_us)
Motor Mount - Turnigy Skateboard Conversion Kit Spare Parts - Motor Mount (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/motor-mount-5.html)

Batteries – 2x ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 5S1P 20C (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-5s1p-20c.html)

ESC - Hobbyking® X-Car 120A Brushless Car ESC (sensored/sensorless) (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-x-car-120a-brushless-car-esc-sensored-sensorless.html) – as for now i’m unable to find any VESC at the good prize available with shipping to my country (Polnad) so I’ve decided to go with the ESC 120A (I’ve heard that ESCs tend to overheat so with the 120A I hope to avoid that problem – please correct me if I’m wrong)

Rc  - APS 2,4 GHz (https://shop.elektro-skateboard.de/eigenbau-tuning/alien-power-system/kits/295/aps-2-4-ghz-fernbedienung-mit-empfaenger?c=50) (If there is any alternative controller which you would recomment please pro vide me with the link – I’m looking for something small and not bulky at the best prize

Charger - IMAX B6 DC Charger 5A 50Whttps://hobbyking.com/en_us/imax-b6-dc-charger-5a-50w-copy.html

Misc connectors - (https://hobbyking.com/de_de/xt90-s-anti-spark-connector-2pairs-bag.html)

As for now I’m looking for a battery indicator as well, however I have some troubles with choosing a compatible one..

The main goal with this setup is to get the top speed of 35 km/h (22 mph, all the calculators show that it will go faster), and good range (however, as for now I’m confused about the range and need help with that). 

If there are any alternative parts at better prize you would recommend I would be happy to hear about them :slight_smile: 

btw. am I missing anything?

Thanks in advance! :)

For the specs for that wax, it says 2-3s lipo. Since you are going to have 10s, I would recommend a vesc. What's your budget for one

Also, 245 kv might be a little high for 10s. I would recommend this motor instead.

Thanks for your answer! :slight_smile:

Okay, so based on your advice I've changed the motor to 192KV.

Thanks for pointing out the 2-3s ESC capabilities - didn't catch that while searching for the ESC :slight_smile:

I'm aware that VESC are far more better, however they costs a lot.. can you recommend me a specific model? thanks in advance.

Btw my budget is 500$ (hope to include shipping in it :P)

I decided to go with a different motor due to it's support for 12s, also I've changed the batteries and decided to go with the VESC as you have advised me to, however I wonder if that prize is a good deal.

There are two things which confuse me, the first one is the battery indicator for 12s (cant find it anywhere..) and second is if this remote controler will be compatible with VESC.

Thanks in advance :slight_smile:

I assume you have the screws for the wheel and wheel pulley...
Does your area have thrift stores? If so just go look and see if they have a long board. Facebook/craig's list would be a good option to find used longboard. 
Battery indicator - https://www.amazon.com/DROK-Lead-acid-Capacity-Indicator-Electric/dp/B01I30RAC4/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1504407235&sr=8-7&keywords=battery+indicator
I'm not too sure if this would work so you can check with the pros lurking around here.
About the remote controller and the vesc. I'm not too familiar with the vesc and I think you can find a cheaper remote controller. The vesc, I can't seem to find the connector for servo connector.

In regard to VESC i've decided to go with this one (diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/#whatvescconnectors) servo connector it's available as an add-on (+1,99$). As for screws i was planning to buy them once i get my parts so I could mesaure them and get the exact size. In my area we do not have any thrift stores unfortunately and craig's  list didn't provide me with any good deals as for deck etc :confused: Anyway thanks for the battery indicator! :slight_smile:

these controllers are cheap and reliable FWIR http://www.ebay.com/itm/2-4GHz-Transmitter-Remote-Controller-4-Channel-Receiver-for-Skateboard-OS917-/311905943819?epid=2167664924&hash=item489f0b010b:g:XBsAAOSw-GFZlQpN 
there are a bunch of resellers for it; it's cheaper than the Winning remote.

You also might still have eRPM issues with 192kv and 12s, although I'm not sure. You'd have 0 problems at 10s. I'd consider spending a little bit more on the deck; it can make a esk8 okay or great!

And don't forget the imax b6 PSU! As well as the various connectors / cables you'll need to make...

It says on the product page, you need a 11-18V @ 5A+. I believe the DC plug size is 5.5 x 2.5 mm (the most common size).

Most LED power supplies will work.

Just for clarification, that's for the charger right

it's for the imax b6, yes. not sure what the clone chargers accept for a max current from the PSU, but the efficiency from PSU -> batteries has been around 50% for me with the b6 clones. (12V 5A supply -> 2.5A charge).
