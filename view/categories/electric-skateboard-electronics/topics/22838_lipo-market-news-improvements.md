I just had some time searching in the wide, wild Lipo section of Hobbyking for something new.
And I found these:

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-nano-tech-a-spec-6600mah-2s-65-130c-lipo-boat-pack.html

Currently out of stock, but I think this would be one of the cheapest and best ways to build a pack!

6600mah 2S 65~130C for 21€?? What??

What are you guys currently buying, Lipo-wise?
Have you found something similar?

It is not much cheaper (imo)....

VTC6 ~ 5€ - 3120mah
2S2P = 2S 6240mah
2S * 2P = 4 cells
4 cells * 5€ = 20€

So the difference is not that big...

PS: i have bought Zippy Flightmax 6S 8Ah ~ 60€ (when it was discounted)

You´re right, but I´m only talking about Lipos here.
And I have my next Trampa 8S setup in mind, so I need cells with at least 300A discharge rate (two 150A 8S ESCs).
So these high discharge cells are really unique for that pricetag :slight_smile:

Graphene

I would highly recommend going through the bargain bin at hobbyking ;)

But yes, you are right. I should have read it more carefully -.-"
