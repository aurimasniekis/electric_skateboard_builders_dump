Hi All,

My cells have arrived and I'm looking at whether I can use nickel strip for my series connections, or copper braid.

I'm building a 10S6P battery, my units of 6 cells are going to be 2 x nickel strip, the strip is 10mm x 0.15mm, I'm planning on using 2 layers for the parallel blocks.

For connection the blocks together in series, I'm not anticipating any flex in the enclosure or deck so I think my battery can be rigid. The idea behind the copper braid in series was to allow for slight movement (if any).

Wondering what the eSkate community think?

Here is my personal recommendation, copper strip will have more conductivity for the same surface area of a nickel strip. I used 10mm x .2mm copperstip double layered with braid on top of batteries that I believe will be under heavy load. Use a larger gauge of braid for the series commections, 3/8" and with double layer nickel you should be fine

Have only built one pack, but I chose to put double layers of 10mm*0.15 nickel strips on all connections. Series were reinforced with 12mm (flat width) tubular copper braid on top of the nickel strips. Made pack for a no flex build.

Edit: Series, not parallels were reinforced..

Ive red somewhere that it may be hard to weld it together because of coppers small resistance from the electrodes

and possibly because battery is made from nickel and your welding copper on it, never tried it buy should work will try it on my next battery build

Cheers guys for the reply. I think I'll proceed with the nickel strips x 2 layers to join in parallel, and then the series connections/joining of each bank of 6 cells with the copper braid.

Not sure if the 6mmx1.5mm copper braid that I have will be enough, noticed a few people have mentioned 10mm wide braid.

Will have solder dots on the nickel strips prior to spot welding them onto the cells, using these solder dots to solder on the copper braid. Thanks all for your help

I wouldn't trust the copper braid to handle flexiness though. In a really rigid pack as reinforcement, no problem, but I'd be worried that flex will eventuality tear that braid with serious risk of batt shorting out.

Not sure 6mm wide braid alone is enough to handle the current load in series connections either. If no nickle I'd use 2x6 and make sure it's well insulated.

This is what I used

As I mentioned though, my experience is limited.

Some people here use nickel strip only, some use both nickel strip and copper. Here my unscientific opinion: I just used two strips of 0.15mm nickel strip stacked(due to space requirements I couldn't add the copper). 

I have a few hundred miles on my 10s5p pack now and it shows ZERO signs of distress at any of the series connections. I used clear shrink wrap so I could test. I did a few bench tests at full load and even rode it hard until It was dead then popped the hood immediately after: nothing was even WARM let alone hot. I think the nickel strip alone is fine. 

I bet that on packs discharging less than 80 amps that even 1 layer wouldn't be a problem(maybe not the most efficient but..). That being said, I think you will be just fine with your combo of nickel strip and braided copper
