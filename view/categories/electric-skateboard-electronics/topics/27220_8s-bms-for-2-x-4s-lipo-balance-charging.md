Hey guys ,   I d like to just plug a single port into my board to charge it.   I chose 2 x 4s batteries in series.
but regular balance charger go up to 6s,  so either I use 2 of them but I need to connect them manually every time , or I could 1 8s BMS  and leave balance port on all the time,  only plugging the power port when needed  ? 

here is an example of what I could do   ?

thanks for your feedbacks guys

It would be a 33.6V Charger. That is not exactly how BMS's work however, you are looking for something more like this.

Or you could use a balance charger and do something like my diagram https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/195O4DXcDSLLYW2YiV5m6OA1Z2fsCO6ywJ2y-_ya_OXo/edit
