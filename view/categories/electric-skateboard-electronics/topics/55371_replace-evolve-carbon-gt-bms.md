Hey!
I'm just trying to look for some info and can't find it through any research.

My Evolve Carbon GT BMS has probably died. (according to Evolve support)
Instead of sending it to evolve and paying for a replacement, is it possible to replace the BMS and if needed ESC, Remote, etc. To get the board working again.

I'd like to keep as many of the original parts as possible just to keep costs down. 
I can't seem to find if this is possible?

Thanks for any help :)

Easiest way is to get a new BesTech BMS, Vescs, and mini or nano remote. Could run you anywhere from $300 to $800 depending on which vescs you go with. While you're at it, you may want to replace the battery in it as well, those tend to go to crap after a year or so.

No.  Unless you also want to replace the ESC, the receiver, and the remote.
