Hi all! I got 2 motor like this https://hobbyking.com/en_us/kd-53-20-brushless-outrunner-195kv.html

Kv:  **195 rpm/v**
Max Current:  **80A**
Max Power:  **1500W**
Cell Count:  **5 ~ 6S LiPoly**

I would like to power it with a 10s battery made of 20 18650 hg2 batteries 3000mAh 20A/30A 3.7v 
Do you think  is it good?

Waiting for some hints

Thanks!

@Davefraud did it work? Because I'm planning to do the same thing but only with turnigy batteries.

Hi! I'm still working on. I do the job in my spare time and I'm now waiting for battery charger port. Then I'll complete the battery pack
