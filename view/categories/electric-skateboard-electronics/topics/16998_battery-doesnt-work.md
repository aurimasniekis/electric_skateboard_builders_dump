I have been at this bms 18650 project for my electric longboard for a couple months and i cant seem to get it to work. 
Setup: 40 18650s 4p 10s   all parallel packs charged to 4v
bms: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Battery-Protection-BMS-PCB-Board-for-10-Packs-36V-Li-ion-Cell-max-45A-w-Balance-/262590563841?hash=item3d239e0601:g:Hm4AAOSwstxVYdt6
motor: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-149kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

I wired my bms according to the picture given in the ebay link and i checked all the balance leads and connections and they all seem good to go. My charger is my ebike charger that i use for another battery that is also 10s 36-42v. When i discharge my battery through the P- of the bms and the positive lead of the battery it works but when i charge it after discharging it with my motor it will charge for a few seconds before the charger goes green again. The battery reads 40v and the charger hasnt yet charged the battery up to 42v. Please help.
