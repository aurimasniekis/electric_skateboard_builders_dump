What LiPO Battery would you recommend for the audrino spot welder? I checked the website and it only shows a battery recommendation for a car battery.. thanks!

I have used 2x zippy flightmax 3s 5000mah 45c in parallel with great success. Also use 2x dynamite reaction 3s 5000c 50c as well. I have lots of toys that use Lipos so I had them already. These provided endless power for my “boss level” spot welder. I had parallel connectors so I didn’t bother trying one battery.

Yes. 120 C burst on 5000 mah will give you the amps needed for the task.

Been using a SMC-Racing True Spec Premium 3S 7200mAh 90C/149AMP LiPo.

Bit expensive but I like it.
