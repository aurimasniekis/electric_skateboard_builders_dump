I bought the trucks, remote and esc from a V1 Boosted board. I have read that the ESC is incompatible with other batteries and BMS, is this true and if so is it possible to make aftermarket batteries work with the boosted ESC?

Iâ€™ve found a second hand V1 bms. 
Does anyone know if this is a possible solution, or are the bms and esc locked together?
