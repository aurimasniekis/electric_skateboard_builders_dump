I don't think there are any chargers for 10s. Not under that price that's for sure.  I don't understand what you mean by not in series though

Ok.  So effectively you are looking for an external balancer charger for 10s. Is i said i don't think you will find.  Under that price the best you will find is an imax clone for 6s. Maybe you can find a bms+ brick charger under that price if you look in china

Most people either separate a 10s into 2x 5s and use the mentioned 6s hobby charger or include a bms in the board and use a 42V power brick.  If any case you have all the information in the forum on how to use both systems

A 10s battery is 10 cells in series. 
The s stands for series.
