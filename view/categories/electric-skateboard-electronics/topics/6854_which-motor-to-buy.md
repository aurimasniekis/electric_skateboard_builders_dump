They are both great. What voltage are you intending to use? Then we can help choose a motor.

Are you using VESC? Will you be climbing hills? If you don't mind me asking your weight, that would help us to find a good motor for your needs. I'd say around 200kv- 215kv for 8s.

Lower kv = more torque, less speed
Higher kv = more speed, less torque

Use this electric skateboard speed calculator: http://toddy616.blogspot.com.au/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html?m=1

I would recommend a 213kv but you may want more torque. Also, make sure that your setup is under the erpm limit (i don't know what the calculation is) some other guys can help you here
