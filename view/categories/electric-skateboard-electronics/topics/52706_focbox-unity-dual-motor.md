interesting. One....MINI?!?!? usb.  I wonder why they didn't design the phase wires in the center instead of the outside. Having screwed up a few FocBoxes, I'm not sure how comfortable I'm with putting all two eggs in one basket if you know what I mean.

That case is using a microUSB. I wonder what the final design would be. The power leads coming out from the side doesn't seem like a good idea

Well mini was the standard before micro came around and I still have plenty of micro cables left kicking around. And I'm not gonna lie I'm not easy on my cables/port that being said my first phone was a T-Mobile G1, which still works to this day, lasted me about 4 years before I wanted an upgrade.

Got an LG Optimus 4x micro USB was terrible on that lasted less than a year. Got a HTC M7 had it for almost 2 years before the micro USB wore out. Bought an M8 which actually ended up having battery issues before the port wore out (I swear it was close tho). And since then I've had USB C on my G5 with a removable battery.

Like is getting more than 2 years from a phone really that God Damn much to ask these days?

While I believe that in theory something was lost somewhere along the line be it in cable manufacturing or port manufacturing not being up to spec Idk. My experience on dozens of various devices have been terrible with micro USB of it where just the odd device I'd believe it but in my experience it's on mass.

I can see a few positives...no more CAN issues, built in voltmeter connection will save some wireing.  The problem I have with it is the possibility of loss of the whole electronic drive system.  That could be the killer depending on the price.  For fairly tame boards (10s on 97's with 15/36, limited to 40 battery amps) it would likely be a perfect solution.  I wouldnt wanna be the 1st to try it with 12 and AT's though :slight_smile:

Exactly - that means you have to buy 2 more instead of 1 more.  This is brilliant.  Just waiting for some proprietary firmware, removing standard connectors in favor of proprietary ones, and some fruit on the back and raise the price a few times for good measure.

The FOCBOX Unity is using a different MCU utilizing 100 pins. I had to count the 25 pins on one side to get that number from the photo. At most I think there have to be at least 30 extra pins over the 64 pin STM32F405RTG to connect and enable to the second DRV8301 on the same side. The MOSFETs look like the ones you can find in RC ESCs.

This is an early render, the whole bottom of the pcb will be coupled to the heatsink. No smt components on the bottom.

I actually find the conversation mini vs micro vs C quite interesting, nothing is set in stone

redundancy is usually good, but does not make sense on mass production. USB Type-C is future proof, can be abused more than micro-USB , is reversible and thinner than mini-USB. So....

Lol will not have 2 usb ports.

As for the power input on the side, routing wise it‚Äôs what makes sense, the board 115mm wide, so 5mm thinner than 2 focbox‚Äôs. So you can easily run the cable w connector on the side, it cleans up the real estate at back of the unit

I've already lost access to motor controller because MicroUSB is garbage.  

Either Mini or C are both fine.  C is future-proof and lots of folks have phones that use USB-C anyway so cables are everywhere.

I have one concern about these that will keep me from investing in them. If one side dies, I am forced to throw away a perfectly good ESC on the other side and replace it...that's not a good idea...I would much rather have a modular product where I can replace one side or the other easily without buying an entire new dual ESC. They are not robust enough and die all the time still, the forums and FB posts are filled with DVR errors and magic smoke..After having two die on me, without user error at all..I will not trust a dual ESC...not until the ESC's are robust enough to last basic usage in the hands of a hobbyist...

No, not really, it's just two VESC's sharing the same board, it duplicates many components, in essence doubling the chances of it frying itself too..If you look at it and understand how these things were made you will see it's simply a combination of two ESC's...they have these for the drone market as well, they call them 4 in 1 ESC's but they are 4 on a board, to safe space, cost 4 times as much and when you lose 1 ESC, you loose 3 good ones too...it's a poor idea until ESC's stop becoming the weak link in our power systems..

It only has one microcontroller, so I would describe it as a single ESC that control two motors.

The bigger problem is the continued presence of the DRV chips.  Except this one has two of them...
It's time to move past those and use a different design.

The above statement and it's source should be enough to prove your previous message as inaccurate.  Apperantly it wasn't enough for you.

So it has one central CPU, ok, that's one component, how about the others and how many are there? Aren't the fets the things always die anyway? \

So my question is simple...when one motor stops spinning, and the other keeps working, what are you going to do with the entire ESC?

Funny thing most of the issue isn't event caused by the DRV but The DIRECTFET, and that is really important to understand, because what makes the directfet special it's also what makes it fails since there are not many assembly companies that can cope with the absolutely precise temperature curve require to solder them, since if it is too cold it will make cold soldering and if your too high the casing tend to come apart from the inside, and this happens in a really narrow temps delta. But you have to take in account, that unlike more regular mosfet package, this one is sinking heat trough it's hole body, which make it harder to regulate the temperature where the soldering is located, specially in a industrial conveyer oven. 

So basically DirectFet are a pain in the A... for manufacturer.  

Before every panic, it doesn't mean that every problem out there is caused by these, and it is Important to remember everyone that Focbox is tested prior to being ship, to catch those issue and help the manufacturer refine their process.  And I have repair enough to know that sadly there is a lot of user error out there (I don't want to be rude to anyone, we all make mistake). 

And BTW a good amount of the problem that occurs from the user is from setting dual ESC in can, without having the 2 ESC booting at the same time.

agreed, the reason this works in mini quads is that quad esc's have become incredibly reliable in the last few years. its very rare to break an esc now, especially if its tucked away in the stack.

Im all for reducing the number of electronics but the reliability needs to be further along than it is at the moment. I love the idea that in the future we may get a good dual esc with nrf, anti spark switch and maybe even bms in a single board. it would may diy super simple and reliable and that makes it accessible to more people. but we are not there yet :frowning:

We had not a single unit with direct fet issues last year... This only seams to be a problem if the manufacturer can't guarantee a steady quality output, which will also result in other issues, not related to direct fets. If a manufacturer can make top spec PCBs, he can probably also solder direct FETs without any issues. 

They are super nice but expensive. That is a reason to decide against them.

I'm totally with you, not every PCB assembly line seams to have the skills to consistently nail them onto the PCB. I doubt that a proper outfit will waste time to hand rework devices in relevant numbers.
They work or end in the bin.
Since six FETs per device are involved the chane to have failing devices gets higher if your supplier doesn't consistently solder them. If the machines are not adjusted correctly the entire batch will probably be affected. 

6 per unit, batches of x makes a couple of K FETs soon... If there was an issue, you would know that pretty fast. We can say the chance to have a bad solder on fets is far below one permil.

Imagine what would happen if 12 FETs are involved... It gets expensive for someone if something goes funny during production.

Your DRVs aren't going to be failing because they are slightly higher ambient temperature due to buck regulator losses, that's a silly notion. They will fail when the gate drivers are stressed outside of maximum limits. An extra 10 degrees Celsius isn't going to be what makes a difference in your DRV surviving when transient voltage spikes etc burn out the gate drives. The ambient thermals wont even affect thermal dynamics during these fast time constant events.

This entire focus on focbox firmware open-sourcing is little more than a smear campaign, the firmware is unchanged from existing open-source repositories.
[/quote]

Maybe not quite "smear" level, but there's certainly some miscommunication happening somewhere. I don't know why, but I've always been of the opinion that the FoxBox runs a modified version of the VESC source code. There's also been [some instances](https://vesc-project.com/node/415) of people asking Enertion for the code and being told by support they are "not authorised" to provide it. This no doubt causes some confusion.

Happy to take your word it is just a stock VESC firmware. Honestly I'd just stick a link to the official GitHub repo on the FocBox product page and be done with it.

[quote="Deodand, post:224, topic:5207"]
The unity firmware which I am developing will contain many new and interesting tidbits which, as the license requires, will be open sourced. To do anything else would violate the spirit of open source license. It is my sincere hope that my work will be used to improve other vesc-inspired designs.
[/quote]

I'm guessing (hoping) you forked from a recent version of the firmware. Any chance this will get merged back into Vedder's repo? Can appreciate there's a significant amount of effort and probably negotiation required to do this, but IMO forking should be a last resort. Although one MCU for 2 motors is probably going to break any hardware abstractions built into the existing firmware... so it may be justified.

Yeah these are good points. I think things do get confused in the chain of communication. 

It is forked from an extremely recent version. I started with the intent of re-merging but it quickly became apparent that the interface/structure was different enough that leaving existing code functional would require a ton of extra development effort on my end and might produce some clunky artifacts/unexpected behaviours. Its possible that someone with more experience than I have at code versioning could figure out how to properly support a single and dual motor driver from a single code base elegantly, but I couldn't think of a clean way. This is something that should be discussed and reviewed once the code is published and others can help us figure out if theres a sensible path to merging. We can start a new thread to discuss the way forward once everything is ready.

Appreciate you coming here and giving us an update! I think people were mad a Enertion only because they didn't release modified gerber files for Focbox but then again it was not really released by anyone who modified the original design, like ollin or other manufacturers and further validated considering vedder did the same thing with hw6.4 by only releasing schematics. It also seemed fair to people who wanted to design something like Focbox as they could still start fairly close with reference hw4.2 design. 
This time its going to be interesting though, as there is no reference dual design.. As you said you would release the code would that also include schematics? I doubt anyone would actually use the schematic to design anything but people get very cranky when they see licence violation on open source projects.

Enertion releasing their version of the firmware doesn't help because you should always flash the newest version anyway.

What they should definitely do is to stop being *******s and link to vedders repo and send their customers a copy of the GPL on general principle. @b264 is right. Laws are laws and just because they think nobody is going to make the effort to sue them, what they are doing is a long way from cool.

Edit: OK just saw they have a lame link to vedder.se on their focbox page but that doesn't help anyone tbh. Also r2 also runs on the soft and hardware

To answer your earlier question before all this chaos which could probably find a better home in a different thread, in regards to open sourcing hardware designs, we want to find a balance between providing a useful reference for software developers to make accessing the hardware as straightforward as possible an allow basic repairs/modifications to be performed. Anyone with a bit of expertise in circuit design could probably figure out from this and the code base how to develop a similar dual motor driver. And if they put in that kind of work they will probably be making something new and interesting for the community to use. 

As you've seen with many other VESC-like designs providing the actual hardware design files tends to encourage ripoffs that undermine the perceived integrity of the platform (see: poorly designed vesc 4.12 ripoffs) . I think that's why we have seen that even Vedder with vesc 6 didn't provide the actual source files for the hardware, just one schematic somewhere off in a forum. This is the trade-off we are grappling and are still deciding on the best path forward. 

Disclaimer: I'm just a person collaborating with Enertion to offer a cool new product. I want to see lots of people use it and develop on it further but I can't speak for them completely. I can guarantee the firmware will be shared in an open source repository.

Also another question if FocBox uses unmodified version of vedder firmware why its frozen to 2.18 version? Why don't they ship it with the latest one available? 2.18 was released in 2016 then it wouldn't need to provide BLDC tool and etc ;)

Also regarding unmodified firmware after work I will dump firmware from one of unmodified focboxes and disassembly it to compare with 2.18 version if I find single function not matching then it means the code was forked :) Which according GPLv3 is binding legally :)

The FOCBOXes in Raptor 2 have a firmware that replies 2.80 to the GET_VERSION command. This is modified firmware. Original firmware had version 2.18. Even if they didn't change anything else apart from the version number, this still requires to publish a complete source code of the firmware and BLDC Tool, because that one is obviously modified too in order to accept unrecognized 2.80 version.

Heh, well there you go. tsk, tsk, Enertion. Part of me wonders if they even have a copy of that source code or if they've just been uploading the same binary for the last 2 years.

It'd be cool if Vedder included some sort of smoking gun / easter egg buried deep inside the code that played "old McDonald had a farm" during motor detection with a special set of config params. Just in case someone decided to build a VESC and not actually tell anyone it was a VESC.

I would say the hardware is somewhere between the two but more in line with the current focbox (beefed up/refined 4.12) as it is a low side dual shunt layout, not three phase shunts like the vesc 6. We save some budget on the BOM by not having 2 MCUs, but if you use phase shunts you cant use the integrated low-side shunt amplifiers in the drv8301/3, that budget you save would then imediatley be spent on 6 shunt amplifiers. It is my opinion that the cost/performance tradeoff for this design choice isn't worth it. I think one of the factors that made the VESC 6 so expensive is extreme 0.1% improvement to performance regardless of cost of the componentry. We instead designed with a focus on performance per dollar, and I think we have been succesful in that regard. The ride still feels super smooth and silent, and we are pushing about %30 more continuous amps during thermal throttling compared to the current focbox. Theres also some unique benefits to driving both motors from a single MCU, the motors are synchronized in such a way that they can kind of "share" the bulk capacitance, since they are driven off the same mcu clock it is possible to offset their peak current draw during pwm cycles. 

The biggest changes with this design are that you're going to save some cash, while getting a motor driver with an easy and much faster installation/calibration, higher performance, integrated switch that wont fail on you, and a really clean and unified phone/computer app that is going to make monitoring/tweaking the ride simple and elegant (if I do my job right :slight_smile: still working to get this just right)

That's really good to hear.  If one of the DRV8302 chips falls over, will the system know to shut down a motor and keep functional brakes on the other motor?  Assuming the MCU isn't powered by the DRV chip -- which is a whole 'nother thing...

It uses the DRV8301 and DRV8303. both have SPI communication (same as vesc6). The buck converter inside the DRV8301 is literally a different circuit inside the integrated  circuit. DRV8303 is the same has the 01 except with no buck converter.

Yes if one motor is faulting for some reason, the mcu will continue to drive the non-faulting one.

There‚Äôs also some added mcu protection on the Unity.

In the case that your motors has faulty hall sensors and the phases get shorted out on the hall pins, it won‚Äôt blow the mcu. I actually seen a few recent cases of this happening

![image|690x183](upload://sHp1DctNGNJkFacDdOpD6etG1aa.png)![image|690x483](upload://ntB3mjo2yLxhsik3B5mbsJ47FyS.png)

So in the graph, the red is a fault occuring, sticking 42V on the hall sensor pin. But on the mcu side, it will never see more than a 4.2V voltage and sinking less than 5mA.

When the fault is removed, second half of the graph. The functionality is back to normal

The normal gpio pins have those diodes internal, so only a current limiting resistor is needed. However the ADC pins do not have this protection internally

Frank, you seem confused on how open source projects work... you can't both open source all the code and also expect to maintain ownership of all the code you open sourced. If people want to help you with that open source version of the project that is awesome. But by open sourcing you are also making the code usable for other seperate projects. It isn't a crime to take open source code and make something new and different, so long as license is followed and I assure you it will be. You also seem to be under the impression that someone owes  you something ethically when this happens. All they owe you is gratitude and maintaining the open source nature of the code. Our app code will be open sourced and acredit the vesc-tool but it will be significantly different. 

It had to be forked from the vesc tool, its functionality is different since it has to interface with a dual motor driver. I don't like the aesthetic of that app. I don't like the non-standard bluetooth module it needs. I don't like the 300 unused setting 95% of users dont ever need to touch. It is one of the reasons the phone app is so difficult to use. We will also offer a modified dual motor driver of the full tool only for computer for those who do need that depth. 

Our app will support the hm-10 module that most people already have. I will leave support for the nrf modules vedder has written code for as well. It also supports the on board usb C. I have been working hard to get the UI and scaling all working well so the experience will be unified

They've already failed dude. As @b264 stated. Enertion (the company you say you're working with) is shipping illegal software already. They refuse to release it's source. http://www.enertionboards.com/new-focbox-speed-controller/focbox-bldc-tool-win/ . They could just throw a .tar ball out in a few minutes and it would be legal. But nope. They've consistently refused. Which is weird considering the license. And they only mention it using "stock" firmware. ;)

It's so fun to watch its like TV show, all the development they did... Yeah right :D took existing stuff modified and they already did magnificent thing then whole development and evolution was carried by vedder himself and now they took it copy pasted already existing blocks (they needed to duplicate almost all methods and just rename methods, pins, and registers to incorporate two control loops) everything else is original same stuff it was such hardship so dramatic :D In the end 0 mentions of Benjamin work on controller or VESC in general :smiley:

Who said I havent tried or havent worked on it ;) I am just later switched writing my own code base as I don't want to be tied down to GPL :slight_smile:

I am negative cause they don't respect creators, they take someone else hard worked project and make they own and advertise like they created it and etc, they didn't needed to create bldc/foc control loops and etc because those things there already done by Benjamin. So far in any of their video or review there was 0 mention of main creator so yeah that's why I am negative. Also they don't respect Licenses several years later still no released source code and etc.

On that topic I compared firmware as I was replacing my burned Focbox with fresh one, there is like 20-30% of different functions compared to 2.18 released firmware object so I don't know how its the same ;)

Tbh I don't like screenshots of private conversations of and or other channel being posted. The topic is about FOCBOX Unity. Personally I think it's great. Although Enertion doesn't mentioned anything about Vedder, most of us know. Nevertheless it doesn't really need to be mentioned as Vedder himself make it open for the community. I personally think companies are free to do this, just like all of us and all communities in the open source community are doing.

Although Enertion has been breaking the law by stealing "something" ie the software, I still do believe that is not a strong case to sue them. In a sense, Vedder him self make VESC open source, by all means he is not "in the path" of making an invention, patent it and sell it for good. If a company decide to make something out of it by twisting the software they copied and the hardware layout (not even the components), in such a away it could also be called a new product. I am not a "law" type of guy, but if Enertion breaking the law and so does the rest of the community that have been making money from VESC except Trampa (as they are working with Vedder).

Yet the purpose of this forum is to make eboard improvements, suing - patents - and all the other crap prevents freedom of development. So if you want to gather a community and do the suing part, I am not against it but not here please.

I don't think any of you understand what is happening here.  enertion is free to use the software if they make their modified source code available to the public.   ***Literally all they have to do is send it to you if you ask, or post it publicly.  This costs them no money and takes almost no time.***

It's just they refuse to do that and thus they are not legally allowed to use Vedder's motor control software or the ChibiOS or QT libraries, which Vedder did not make.

They could fix it in one minute for free but they decide not to.  We need to respect their decision to operate illegally.

Nobody here is saying they can't use the software.  Well, nobody except enertion themselves, anyway.

the thread is for the unity... 

If its based on vesc firmware, by gpl it should have the code modifications released so that someone can add a target file with the proper pinouts and libraries used, so say ackmaniac or the likes could add the target. I mean its going to be distributed via the hardware, so technically all modifications by law should be released.

I wouldn't run a unity until firmware could be compiled independently for it and the code reviewed. It's new, and poses a risk to my safety if I were to run it. So whether it gets released under GPL or not, will depends on if I ever try this. 

Just my view...

the hardware gerbers etc.  I care much less about, provided the MCU pinouts are provided to make a proper target file for compilation.

Or imagine hidden Easter egg if you do full acceleration / let go / full acceleration / let go / full acceleration and it stops and starts playing melody with motors then you were going ~30mph 

@Nemesis GPL requires a whole project be open source :) and shipped together with distributed compiled executable in this case Firmware and Application

I agree that Enertion "have a probable chance" of illegally stealing and or missused the license. Yet again, if I make a company "ABCDEF" that produces modified VESC that I won't mention it's even using VESC, reverse engineer few things like removing the DRV chip, you won't even notice I illegally do the practice. There is also a chance that FOCBOX unity is half VESC and half something new.

Yet tbh even if Enertion is wrong, the one needs suing is Vedder and Trampa (not the community). It's a good reminder, yet we gain nothing from #whoeverwinsthefight.

I've already said my piece about hardware and software

But software under gpl v3 must continue under gpl v3. You cannot change the license of derivatives. That's JUST how it is. And doing otherwise is breaking the law. 

However the only one that can instantiate a claim against any offending party is the stakeholder/s

Hardware goes under the radar all the time. But not releasing modified code that is gpl'd is stealing. 

.

As far as not even noticing. Yea it's not that hard to notice, especially when you release a product in a small community like ours. Just pull the hex off the chip and look at the binary. Code matching is quite simple.

I wish people didn't sit here and argue about software licenses when, 1 don't have a clue, 2 aren't even in the software engineering industry, 3 have no professional background to stand behind such opinions.

I'm done and out because it's already stated to be released

This is not true.  The license is put there for a reason, so the entire community can benefit from more innovation.  The reason enertion can innovate based on Vedder's work is because of this.  If they followed the law, other people could also innovate from enertion's work and the whole community wins.  So, you're not correct.  We do win.  We do have something to gain.  We want more products, from more companies, with more features, for cheaper, so we can build better stuff.  It's the whole premise behind free software licenses.  Vedder said anyone using his stuff is legally required to give it away, just like he did.  enertion not doing that is actively hurting you and this community and nobody can see that.

@longhairedboy, thx for stating a prime example of how to offer the product in a very fair way. Highly appreciated! Anyone wanting to buy a FocBox: LHB should be your source. Fair, good service and experienced in building awesome boards.

That's because ya'll be hungry. I sell out and re-up twice a month on average. Just place your order now and you'll have it within about 10 days. They're on the way to me  now. There was a week long mosfet shortage mega crisis apparently or i would have had them already. lol

Enertion: changing the world one gargantuan mosfet order at a time. 

They're probably also the reason i can't get my damned IRFS7530s for my fucking eswitches..... I hope the 7734 doesn't explode or anything... and i think they may also be behind a cap shortage. Jason's a fucking steamroller. man. When i couldn't find my socks this morning, i just assumed he must have ordered 35 billion pairs from china and now everyone's out.

I heard they sprinkle directfets over thier cereal in the morning, and before they go out to party, they crush them and blow them up their noses. I've seen satellite photography with my own eyes of them rolling them into burger patties at backyard barbeques. I've even heard a rumor that they have an entire swimming pool of them and they just dive in like scrooge mcduck.

Performance wise it should just be identical. If your motors can do over 60 amps continuous you could see more startup torque due to higher continuous current rating. 

Top speed will be unaffected. Cheers!

@Deodand @bevilacqua @JohnnyMeduse 

I am looking to build an enclosure for a future board and i would like to plan to use the unity. I had 2 questions that i haven't been able to find the answers to so far.

 - Do you have final or rough dimensions for the Unity that you can share with us? 
 - Does it currently have mounting holes on the bottom similar to the the focbox?
 - Will it come with the same strange 3.5mm bullet connectors as the focbox?, if so will it still void the warranty to swap them to a more standard size?

Also, on previous projects i have had to re-cad the original focbox myself from measurements taken by hand. This is time consuming and will never be 100% correct. I wondered if you would you ever release a cad "block model" for the Unity so those looking to make compatible enclosures or mounts can base their designs off of official measurements?

I have been thinking about the logistics of using the unity in a build and have come up with a few more questions.

Im assuming the intention with the integrated e-switch is that this vesc would be used with a charge only BMS. In this case the BMS is not able to disconnect power to the unity if the battery is low or in over current situations. 

 - Will the Unity include its own under voltage protection where at some programmable level it will shut the mcu down until the battery is charged again? 
 - Will there be any over current protection in case of fault or will the user need to install external fuses?

 - Does power switch just send a signal telling the mcu to wake/sleep or does it actually cut power to the processor? 
 - If power to the processor is always present then what "standby" power consumption can we expect from the unity? 
 - if power to the processor is always present then are we able to access this via one of the headers to power other electronics whilst the board is "off"?

I know that this is a lot of questions and i appreciate that you may not be able to provide answers for all of them at this time however any information you can provide would be very useful.

Just don't want to answer questions on the physical layout before parts are finalized :slight_smile: Also, I'm fairly certain we aren't legally obligated to do anything until it is an actual product being sold. 

Meant to say earlier, the unity's MCU won't have control over the power switch, so the desired power on/off features won't be possible. We thought about implementing these but decided to prioritize release instead. All the features are mostly nice-to-haves not need-to-haves except for Under-Voltage lockout for battery protection in a bypassed BMS. 

Will be something we look at doing in the future since the circuitry is relatively simple, but it would require another round or two of prototyping and testing before production and we want to release the Unity ASAP.

Edit: You'll want an external fuse.

Warranty I guess., Krus eventually going to be overwhelmed and as bad as Enertions warranty is at times , at least it‚Äôs there , and if your FOCBOX breaks you have a variety of vendor options to get it from if Enertion decides not to replace or offer another one for a low price. 

And judging by the specs , you have to see if the ESC Cost/Breakage is worth it. Cause the ESC. , as all eventually do, will somehow break, and you have to see if your builds price boundary support the Cost/Breakage of whatever you‚Äôre using

Forgive my lack of knowledge on the topic, but he mentions better efficiency and better range on any current setups. Would it offer a significant change over dual Focbox setups ?  @JohnnyMeduse, specifically for the DSS60, overlooking the switch issue, would allowing the motors to pull 80 A make it leave off the start even faster ? and the more efficient Mosfets increase range by let's say anything greater than 2% ?

you could place a jumper connector on the switch input of the Unity, that will allow the BMS to keep full control of the discharge and on-off portion.

Sorry, I am not exactly sure what a jumper connector is. Tried googling it. English is not my first language. 

Does it results in shorting the Unity switch? If the Unity switch is momentary a long press might have a different function than a short press. It is up to the software. So shorting the switch wires on the Unity could have unwanted consequences. But I am not sure if it is a momentary switch at all?

Unity switch is not momentary. It is spdt, all you have to do is short the switch in the on postion if it isn't needed.

The board probably shouldn't do more than 80 amps battery current max. This means you can do 80 amps per motor up to 50% of max speed then you will drop linearly from 80 to 40 amps per motor as you approach the max speed of your board. If you need more than this you probably want to solder an XT90 with some huge wires on instead. For most lithium ion pack this wont be the limiting factor though. 

In regards to 80 amps per motor, testing has shown it can do 80 amps for each motor for around 1-2 minutes before any kind of throttling kicks in. It then falls off quite slowly and stabilizes around 70 amps for longer than we ran the test. These are lab tests of course, soon a slew of beta testers will have the boards and they can monitor thermals and let you guys know what a beast it is! 

Most of the "continuous" current ratings you see are rated around this time scale of 1-2 minutes. Past that pretty much any case at the same scale (small enough to fit an eskate) is going to need some exterior means of removing heat. Connect it to a giant metal plate, air cooling, etc. You crazy high power people know the drill üòÅ

Honestly past a couple minutes I doubt the max continuous current ratings matter for eskate riders. Its a nice metric for comparison I suppose. Other applications true max continuous current can be hugely important, but not eskate in my opinion. 

Up a long hill with both motor doing 80 amps at 15mph/25kmh,  you're looking at 1/2 mile or 1km  long hill that is extremely steep. Thats probably the upper limit for most use cases unless you are commuting one way up a mountain or something.

I don't think you'll see the same delays as with full raptor 2 since there are less parts coming together. We expect to have units shipping within a few months. 

Here's a quick drawing of the bottom plate of the unity with mounting holes:

Case still has some small design changes in the mix but overall size and mounting hole positions are finalized.

Honestly, we could make that change if it is something a large portion of users needed. The connector is so bulky though and only 6p packs and lipo users need it. People using these components should probably be fairly experienced at DIY and have an easy time replacing the power input cord. 

That is just my thoughts anyway!

that why you should test it first, ask a professional someone that provides you with a warranty, or buy an extended warranty... And BTW 90% of the time DRV POP after an initial run because of a bad setting or customer error which aren't covered by the usual warranty. 

But if you still don't feel safe, that is up to you to build your board around the parts you buy. Anyway, XT60 and 3.5mm bullet will provide more than enough power for 90% of the build out there. And on the last 10% it usually overpowered build or Ebike, that are built by people who usually knows what they are doing. 

I just want to add this... It is because the esc you buy have 10AWG wire and XT90 connector, that mean they can handle more current than and XT30 and 14AWG cable... sometime it is all about perception, especially when they hide there week spot.

You can inject current into the d-axis to counteract the magnetic fields of the permanent magnets... Currently all control is just focused on minimizing d-axis current and maximizing q-axis current for maximum efficiency. But you could probably squeeze out a bit more max speed by injecting d-axis current at the cost of efficiency. This is my understanding anyway but have only skimmed a few papers on the process so by no means an expert.

EDIT: to the curious just [read the intro to this little document](https://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/17643253/PED4_1038C.pdf) it gives a nice summary.

Hi @Blasto ... that's not our experience. Our testing shows this does matter. I understand it fluctuates outbound (and inbound) if V is related to your RPM. In our case, it's not. Our system runs constant V.

So, for example, if you sustain V at say 48-52 (our system) and then run 30a inbound continuously (say 1440w) per motor, how long will it last? 

Are you saying it can run 48v and 80a inbound 'all day', that's nearly 4000w constant; more than we've seen testing anything else. 

Maybe that's the total of both, so similar to 2 x VESC 6 with heatsink at say 2000w constant each.

Thanks.

We don't have a good setup for loading the system with 4 kW output. 

Yesterday I did a ride up a long hill and output total of 2 kW (~ 45-60 amps per motor at around 15-30 volts applied) for around a minute and a half and saw a temperature rise of about 15 Celsius. Video coming soon :wink:. Mainly this was limited by the battery current limits and voltage sag of the 10s4p  pack. 

My guess is that your suggested use case 30 amps per motor at 48V could be sustained beyond 30 minutes and probably indefinitely if you give the motor driver an interface to sink heat into the air (mount it to a metal plate or something). You're going to run into problems with the power input if you try to output 8 kW, probably would want to up wire gauge and change connector so you could take in 160 amps at 50V... ultimatley only testing can show whats possible in these kind of upper limit scenarios which are outside the range of anything an eskate would use.

Did some reading on MTPA control, just to make sure we aren't losing efficiency because of wrong algorithm choice. My reading suggests that the motors we are using in Eskate are nonsalient, which is to say the inductance of the motor doesn't change whether you are along the d or q axis of the motor. [This is where I'm gleaning the information from](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/201123/explanation-of-lq-ld-and-how-it-relates-to-motor-inductance), someone tell me if this seems incorrect. These are equations for MTPA: 

![image|346x145](upload://gUyd71VNs7i7MHJy0NphTkCXGt8.png)

If our motors are nonsalient than Ld = Lq and simplifying the second equation for i_d yields 0. Setting i_d to 0 is what we are already doing.... so problem that wasn't a problem solved?
```

Setting isd=0 means that you operate at constant flux controll till you hit i_max. This method is more dynamic and is usually used in industrial aplications. In Electric mobility vehicles you would rather eliminate copper losses by sacrificing some responsiveness (moving i_sd is slow...). That‚Äôs why MTPA is used. 

Regarding field weakening. The problem is that at higher speeds we would loose braking torque. On electric cars it is ok because of the mech. brakes, but on our application not... 

MTPA was on Benjamin‚Äôs ToDo list. I guess it is way more complicated to code than it seems...

Based on what I have read it seems that MTPA for the nonsalient motors we are using is equivalent to setting Isd=0, Can you point me towards something to read on the topic that would suggest otherwise? Thanks!

[Here is another source where they use a nonsalient motor and set isd=0 for MTPA](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5873156). See their description of region I (fig. 1) for MTPA where the condition is given as isd =0 for a nonsalient motor:
