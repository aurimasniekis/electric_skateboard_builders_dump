What is this thing on the back of the PCB of the Mini remote?

And how do I find another one?

It seems to be missing from another remote ... I guess that's why it's not working 

A factory fuck up

That creates the signal that the receiver receives right? Basically like a radio transmission?

I don't know if theyvwould have them. I'd check there website and then call with the part number. (If they have it)

@JohnnyMeduse I clicked the link kinda hoping for some Indiana Jone's type of shit but was genuinely bummed out to find out they wasted such a cool name on that.

Sorry to disappoint, but here some genuine flux capacitor...

Just look at mine and realize that if you have this part on the other side, it is the same but with a different pakage

It generates a frequency. It doesn't do any transmission or anything like that. You put a voltage through it and i will generate a predefined frequency that you can use to "sample" time.

@JohnnyMeduse how are you finding mg's no clean flux? I've been hating it since the day i started using it. Works like a charm, but its MESSY!

Well, I've been using It for the last 10year without any problem... you just need to clean it with alcool and heat.

See, that's the worst part... its "no clean" flux rofl! That's what i do, grab some lint free cloth saturate it with isopropyl 99% and use the soldering iron to push it around.

That's what they mean by "no clean". They just have bad grammer.

YES IT'S NO CLEAN.... but you need the process behind.... like a oven... temperature curve... and industrial processus.... It's not really meant for using with only a soldering Iron or heat station....

also it is no clean because the flux dielectric is so high that you technically don't need to remove it.

If you want easy to clean flux... take water soluble flux.
