The ESC takes the DC Voltage of your Battery und transforms it into AC-like 3-Phase Voltage that drives your 3-phase motors.
If you want more info on this topic you should search google for it, plenty of information available and no point in writing it here again when other people explained it perfectly fine and in more detail elsewhere.
