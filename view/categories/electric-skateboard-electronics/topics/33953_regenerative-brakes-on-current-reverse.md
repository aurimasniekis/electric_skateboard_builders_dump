Hi!

Does anyone know if the breaks will be regenerative when you set control mode to "Current" in the BLDC-tool? I mean will the battery be charged when not reversing?

Thanks!

Yes, it should. I've never tested it, but that's how it should work.

the motors will always brake before reversing, so yes regen will work.
