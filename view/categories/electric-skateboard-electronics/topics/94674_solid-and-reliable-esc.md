Can anyone give me an example of a good ESC, maybe not the best of the best but something decent and reliable. I don't know how much a solid ESC would cost or if its something you really want to spend more money on but if anyone has any suggestions that would be helpful.

Buy the hobbyking YEP 20a contoller. It should do the job. Ive used to to power a full size electric car and it did fine.

holy crap.... to be clear that was a joke. do not buy this product.

you really need to read the getting started post before asking questions this simple. this is not a hobby where people will do it all for you. buy a prebuilt board if you dont want to bother researching

Try looking for "VESC". It's an open-source ESC. As it's open-source, different manufacturers took the recipe and made their own ESC from it.

I would recommend the Focbox (as I said, based on VESC) but they are not produced anymore sadly. Not sure about a good replacement for it actually. Maybe a Flipsky one? Do some research, you should be able to find out by yourself :)

What eac or vesc would depend on your need and budget you want to spend.

Get a FocBox. There are used and refurbished ones floating around. Ask @JLabs, @JohnnyMeduse and search for 'focbox'.

FOCBOX, FOCBOZ(Jason) Unity if using dual drive, TB VESC 4.12, VESC 4.20 if you want to read the thread on how to fix it.
