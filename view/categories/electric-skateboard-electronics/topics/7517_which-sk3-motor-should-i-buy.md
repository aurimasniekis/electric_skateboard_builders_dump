Just a quick question for my 12S A123 cell build. Nominal voltage is 38.4v. I am planning on running a single motor setup. I am currently using TB's 12S ESC waiting for a VESC. Motor pulley 15T and Wheel Pulley 36T.

Which SK3 would you guys recommend?

There are a few 63mm models that I was looking at. 

190kv - http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=18181

192kv - http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18129__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6374_192kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor.html

My bad didn't see that. 

192kv is gonna be perfect for you. It's tried and tested by Enertion.

I was just worried about how the current rating is 80A on the 192kv motor and also has max voltage at 44v.

The other motor seemed to bit my battery's specs better.

What about the 80A current rating worries you?

12s + 15t +36t + 44v = 192kv

(actually it equals 107, but I vote 192kv, also) :grin:

That is way too low of a KV. I am running around 10S in terms of Li-Ion cells. 12S LiFePO4 = 10S Li-Ion
