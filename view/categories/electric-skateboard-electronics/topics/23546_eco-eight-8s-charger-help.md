Ok so I bought this charger in December thinking I could charge my 8s but I had no idea how to power it and now that my imaxb6 V2 broke I wanted to see if I could get it working any ideas other then a car battery.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/f/1f954c17cf73dec3c699f4c7173d58448f9eef42.JPG" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/a/faecfa098532ccd928ab3c0d550a4007338dbcac.JPG" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/1/11180e72adf8cc538fc45623338a38371af1ee3b.JPG" width="281" height="500">

```
The easiest way is to get a DC powersupply from an RC hobby store.
Get one with roughly 300w output, 500w if you want some extra headroom.
But any powersupply with 12-18v output should work.

Ok so how would I plug it in because there is only the red and black wires that come out

```
you would need to cut the end off the plug on a power supply and connect the positive to the red and negative to the black wires.
