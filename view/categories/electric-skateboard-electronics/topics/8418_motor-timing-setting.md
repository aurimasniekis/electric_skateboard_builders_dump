I changed from normal to very high and it increased my speed by 4km/h.

short story:
high timing is best for running your motor at its peak RPM most often
low timing is for running low RPM most often.

you need to make a judgment on how you use your motor and set it accordingly.

It says it's a relationship between motor sensors and motor phases ?,...does this apply to our Sensorless Motors ??

So have any of you guys measured heat (temperature) after a ride?
Would that be an accurate indicator for this application? 
Do you apply the 160 degree rule here?

My motor never gets hot on very high timing. Warm to the touch.
