Hi

I have bought a 10S 80Amp BMS

I have no idea where to solder the balance wires, or where to learn 

I am creating a diagram of all components so I can double check with the forum before I mess anything up, but I have just started so bear with me :)

This is my first build and sorry for stupid questions. There are other threads with similar questions but I want to be cautious

Diagram

I found this, but the image doesn't clearly show where the wires go, or they do go where it says?

I mean on the battery

The connect to the nickel strips welded to the cells.  Soldered onto the nickel in-between cells

But which cells? Theres 10 wires

```
B- is the negative end of the battery
B1 should be about 3.7V higher than B-
B2 should be about 3.7V higher than B1
B3 should be about 3.7V higher than B2
B4 should be about 3.7V higher than B3
B5 should be about 3.7V higher than B4
B6 should be about 3.7V higher than B5
B7 should be about 3.7V higher than B6
B8 should be about 3.7V higher than B7
B9 should be about 3.7V higher than B8
B10 should be about 3.7V higher than B9
B+ should be about 0.0V higher than B10
```

So for the sake of the diagram, do you know if the one I showed is right

Yep it's correct

No, the first image is not correct.  The red things that say 12AWG should be gone
```

This is correct

I've seen people connect 12awg wires![Screenshot_2018-02-16-23-47-25|690x388](upload://3aOkOvCku6fEQnlGJKGZQ5kZUCd.png)
I thought I'd do the same?

## \#13 Posted by: moon Posted at: 2018-02-16T23:50:22.952Z Reads: 127

```
So B2,B4,B6 go in between the cells and on the nickel?
```

```
What do you mean by in between and on the nickel
If you mean does the wire get squeezed in between, yes if you don't add a tab of nickel that'll fold over the top to connect the balance, that would be preferred

Yes to that too, those are 2 diff P groups
```

---
## \#17 Posted by: moon Posted at: 2018-02-16T23:54:40.764Z Reads: 123

```
And it's a good idea to bridge the 2 parrell groups with 12 AWG
```

The first image above is not correct, I fixed it here:

If up to 50-60A that's fine, if more, then 10AWG

@moon look at the diagram @b264 posted, make sure it's like that, your original diagram was incorrect
```

## \#20 Posted by: darkkevind Posted at: 2018-02-17T00:09:40.062Z Reads: 115

```
You would be bridging the SERIES joins with what should be 10awg wire... not 12awg.

Those wires are also nothing to do with the balance leads.. they're the main series connections of the battery pack joining the paralleled cells together in series.
```

I know that they were unrelated to balance leads, but I just drew that on the diagram.

That looks good, I would only suggest to move the display after the BMS, so it can turn off too, unless it has its own switch

Where can I find the nickel that you used at this timeframe of the video?

AliExpress. Although I can't seem to find the link at the moment :/

## \#27 Posted by: Slak Posted at: 2018-03-01T12:48:52.423Z Reads: 79

But on your updated diagram, there is still nickel strips AND AWG wire on the spots numbered 3, 5, 7 and 9. Is that correct ? Because it seems different from what @b264 showed us on his diagram.

@Slak, Correct; that's to make it more flexible so it doesn't break under vibration.

what nickel strips are you using between the cells (middle of the pack) @darkkevind ? I’ve seen some builds with ladder style nickel strips which are not made for high current draw!?

Or let’s phrase it differently, what would you use for higher current draws 60-80 Amps?
```

He is using ladder style, but he is probably using the good kind
```

## \#33 Posted by: darkkevind Posted at: 2018-03-02T01:35:14.459Z Reads: 66

Yes @moon definitely the good kind.

Each ladder run needs only carry the current of one cell to the other, so they are well within their capabilities @Schulerbible ....
