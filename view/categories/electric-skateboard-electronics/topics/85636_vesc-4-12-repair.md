Hello everyone.

So im attempting to fix a vesc, i had sent my 6.6 to martin for repair and he done a great job and its back in the scooter pushing14s.

I had a couple of fs4.12 laying around but as they were only Â£45 it would made more sense to buy new 1's, so i decided to try and learn something by trying to fix myself.  With some advise from martin i picked the easiest 1 to do, change the fets.

Whilst i was waiting for the fets to arrive i decided to take some fets off of another to see if it would work. To my suprise it did work, kind of lol. When i would do a motor detection to spin motor, it would make a spark noise then nothing the it spun normally. That confirmed it was the fets to me, as it would do motor detection before.

Fets came yesterday and i swapped them out. Now when it tries to spin the motor on foc it makes a noise but nothing happens. I tried bldc and the motor spins real slowly and making a funny noise. When i throttle the motor turns very slowly. 

Its running a 4130 motor and 6s ion battery. Regen and braking are off as it for a free wheeling scooter.

Try spinning the motor for hand when you do the ditection. Could be your motor is sensorless

When i do continuity check on the front fets, they show a resistance of 624 from pin 1 to 6 but on the back the resistance is 0. Im sure it is resistance it measures
