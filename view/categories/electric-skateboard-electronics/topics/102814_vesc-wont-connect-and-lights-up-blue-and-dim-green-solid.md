Does this mean it's dead?

Here's a picture. No visible damage to the vesc so I'm wondering what the issue is.

What do you mean it wont connect? Did you connect a receiver and test? Have you tried connecting it to a PC?

Sorry for not getting back sooner, but I tried with multiple cables and then changed my device and it connected. It still has both dim green and blue light on. Is that a bad sign?
