Looks interesting.
How much would the price be for the kit (esc + transmission)?
Have you considered switching to 5M belts instead of 3M?

I have heard several people complain about orders to being fullfilled recently by ownboard...is this true?

Shockingly similar to the diyeboard belt drive system that has been proven to be rubbish.  3m is not an option in a modern belt drive.

How strong are your trucks? What diameter of the hanger where you mount the motor mount? Because cheap cast trucks snap and could kill you, even Caliber 2 trucks snap @b264 can confirm
Also 3m is not good at all, you need 5m belts

To convince people here you would have to outline the differences in detail before anyone will take you seriously with that set up.  Actually make a system that has the details that are common place in a real belt drive like 5m belts.   Don't mean to be rude but the community has been burnt by cheap belt drives before and won't take you seriously unless you address the problems or prove that yours is not produced in the same place.

Wait you cant change wheels? Whats the point? Why cant you take the pulley off the wheels.  That is a vitale reason new folks would use belt drive over hubs.

Give the option to change to real ABECs or other such options

looks more like boosted if you ask me (v1) same 3 bolts holding the motor mount in and 3m belts... and the same tension system (springs) and both made for caliber trucks except the ownboard trucks might be clones

almost exactly the same as boosted but different motors

I think you might be right there my friend.  Very similar.  Might have to eat my words.  I think boosted are doing a change up soon so may have released the designs or its just been copied ruthlessly.  I was just about to buy an ownboard kit for the wife too.

shockingly the diyeboard kit uses 5m belts, also boosted has moved away from the design because it loosened up once in a while

Perhaps they were able to get a hold of Boosted V1 drive system from an old manufacturer and convince them to restart production. It looks exactly the same, down to the curvatures of the design, the thickness of the mounts, and the spring tensioning system.

that was what i also also thinking but arent these drives patented by boosted? also it seems ownboard is not using genuine caliber 2's like boosted used to

but werent boosted v1 made in the usa?

Well, we know the Chinese don't have the best track record of adhering to patent law.
And I would guess they are not Genuine Calibers, since they would advertise it heavily if it was.

And not sure about where Boosted V1 was made, but even if they were assembled in the US, it wouldn't surprise me if the parts were manufactured in China.

Paired with the right battery and a VESC, looks like this drive train has potential.
Of course, we'll have to see if these trucks are prone to snapping.

I think it's good that consumers are getting choice over all the hub drive boards that have come to market. If you listen to Daniel's feedback and others here they will tell you what they want its just a matter if you can deliver. I don't know nuthin' about belt drives so if people are saying "use 5M belts over 3M belts" I would take a close look at what they are saying.

Hmmm guys we might be able to use Jlabs pulleys with these from what Iâ€™m seeing. 

If so the only true thing holding back this drive is the motor pulley and whether or not it is 3mm or 3mmish

Prone to slippage when paired with some power.  Still think its good if it is indeed sourced from the boosted.

Adjusting the belt tension was slightly difficult to adjust but once installed never had to readjust. ![image|384x500](upload://svpPghPprfyc00pz6HJDeBVO5Bs.jpeg) The 3m belt has no slippage for me probably because Iâ€™m 130lbs but they are also 15mm belts. Way better than the diyeboard kit or the flipsky kit. With the same Vesc settings I felt that their 5045 motor felt more powerful than the 5065 motor that came from the flipsky belt kit. Flipsky uses 12mm 5m belts while ownboard uses 15mm 3m belts.
The quality is good. Their pulleys are well made too albeit in the 3m variant. Also no belt slippage here. With the flipsky/diyeboard the belt slippage was quite apparent even for my light weight self.

15mm wide is great news. Probably makes a bigger difference then 3m vs 5m

These look like they could be decent for small budget builds. The removable and interchangeable pulleys were a definite move in the right direction. 

Any idea on Price/ETA? Link to purchase? Does this utilize automatic belt tensioning system like boosted(springs?)? Is it a kit with motors included or just rolling drivetrain?

I am running a FLIPSKY Dual 4.2 plus and wheels around 81/82mm (they were originally 83 but they werenâ€™t centered correctly and so we grounded them down.... I topped out a little south of 42 km/h. And that was full throttle.


Torque and brakes were amazing for me. If I didnt read about it I wouldâ€™ve never known that 5m was supposedly better than 3m. For me the 3m in 15mm was fantastic. Nonetheless Iâ€™d want 5m cus the internet said so haha
