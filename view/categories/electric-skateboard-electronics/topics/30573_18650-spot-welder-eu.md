I'm thinking of getting into building my battery-pack myself...
Therefor i'd like to know if someone in the EU knows where i could buy a decent 18650 spot-welder.
May be used, as long as it works ! :slight_smile:

Kind regards

Thing is, I already bought a pack in a group-buy some time ago. The welds aren't much to speak of so I'd have to reweld it anyways. But, what i'm meaning to say.... I already have my cells..

then better get one of the arduino kits and repair your kit. ItÂ´s the best and cheapest option as far as i know

I bought the Sunko 709A (the one with a welding pen) on ebay from Germany. Works like a champ but you have to have a 16A fuse at home or it won't work with the pen. The normal probes on the box works with 10A fuse. (I have tested this myself)
I think I paid 2000sek which is like 210â‚¬ but I am planning on builsing multiple packs.
