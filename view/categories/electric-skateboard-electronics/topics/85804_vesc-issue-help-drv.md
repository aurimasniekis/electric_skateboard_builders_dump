 "TB vescs from you. I am having trouble with both of them. Neither one of them are working. The one with the replaced resistor has some faults and the other one just doesn't connect to the computer. I've tried different cables different computers ect. However the one with the replaced resistor connects fine when I run motor detection it fails and gives faults. The one that doesn't connect just turns on solid blue. The other one has a blue light then a green light comes on."

I have been so unlucky this month

Broken wrist + broken battery + no functional boards + 2 bad vesc
