Hi everyone!
I am quite new to this page, but after looking through this awesome forum, I think I will like it a lot. I am currently in high school and I am going to make an electric Longboard as my graduation work. I have bought all my necessary bits and pieces (batteries, ESC, motor, transmitter etc.). The board that I am going to use, is selfmade and the motor mount and the drilling of the pulleys as well. 
But there is a concern: I would like to use another switch, than the one that is pre installed on the ESC, is it possible to remove it and solder a new one?

Thank you very much for your help and appreciate all of your upcoming help towards other user such as me :)

P.S. This is the ESC, that I am using: http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__33984__TrackStar_150A_GenII_1_8th_Scale_Sensored_Brushless_Car_ESC_PC_Programmable_.html
And this is the switch, which I would like to use instead:
