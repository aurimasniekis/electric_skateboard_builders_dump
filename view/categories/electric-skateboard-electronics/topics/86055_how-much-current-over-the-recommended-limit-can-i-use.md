I have  [this motor](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-190kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) and the 'Max Loading' is rated at 65A which is what I'm running at the moment. I'm using it on a bike with a VESC 4.12. Would it harm the motor to run at say 80A or is 65 the absolute limit. I will have to add additional cooling to the VESC as it gets quite hot when going up hills but that's not too hard. Any thoughts?

Running higher amps through your motors won't get your a higher top speed only torque. I would say that 80 will be fine and the motor is rated for 65A continuous. I could be wrong though.... I was would say worst case the motor will overheat the magnets and you will lose power.

I agree with Friskies.  The amperage will give you more torque (uphill power).  

I would worry more about my batteries, and VESC before the motor.  

Example: VESC 4.12 is rated at 50a continuous and 240a for "short" burst.

A [Lipo 5A 20C](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-3s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html) is  rated for 5x20 = 100a continuous ( I would not do this Hot Hot Hot!).

An 18650 Cell rated at 3a is usually thought of as 2c - 8c depending on battery...  (You would have to look at the specs).  So, Lets say you are using cheap aliExpress knockoffs at 2c or 3a x 2 = 6a ...  If you are running your 18650 cell pack at lets say a 4p.  Then that is 4x6 = 24amps.  I could have explained that better...

I am open to correction...  I am not an 18650 guy...

Ok thanks for the feedback. My li-pos are rated for 120A max so should be ok there. They also have quite a bit of ventilation. I'll try running at 80A and see if it makes a considerable difference and nothing get too hot! As Friskies mentioned and I forgot to, I'm trying to increase torque and therefore acceleration not speed.

Lipo ratings are exaggerated, I donâ€™t think you could pull more than about 60-70a with them over heating
