Hi esb, ive turned here after running myself and my pockets dry trying to upgrade my board and only to have less than 6 miles per charge on my space cell pro 4.... thats less than a third of the mileage stated in the blurb of the product, and (around 20) seems to be what everyone else is getting too. I got 8 miles on a full charge with dual belt drive motors ( I chalked that up to me and it being inefficient) and now ive switched to dual hub motors and now im down to less than 6. For 500 ish dollars i expect a product more than capable of delivering 12 miles of range... Is anyone well versed enough to help me?

Specs: dual 130kv Torqueboard hub motors
space cell pro 4
2x Torqueboard VESC


im just lost as to what i can possibly do :C

i contacted enertion about this and they basically told me to sod off. its been like this since day one and now its becoming more of an issue due to me needing the extra mileage for my commute. They did put me in a chat with a guy i can send it off to, but told me that i need to cover all the shipping and repair costs and everything. I can understand that i guess.... I just dont know what could have gone wrong. I baby the crap out of the board lol

You can send it off to them if you want I also do repairs on spacecells, I'm in cali so shipping will be cheaper. I might be aboe to trouble shoot it from my house though

ok so i just replugged it in to use the bldc tool again, and when i went to turn it on, it started normally and then kept turning on and off again and again. Im seriously about to just order another battery and shove it in the shell of this one...  Heres the bldc tab @Jinra<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/c/3c3ca6b3ad9b1d1b1c52a2602618f199d2b165f7.PNG" width="690" height="407">

What's your weight and riding environment? Honestly, it sounds like maybe some tabs broke off some of the cells
in the parallel groups.

Dont think its the battery. I have 2 and they are in the 8-12 mile range. 20 miles are for perfect road conditions with a lightweight little guy (125-135lb) cruising at 10-12mph i think. Its just reality and not "real range"

i really dont think that that should be the case though. it advertised 40km of range... 40/5 = 8 8 *3 = 24

I expect more range and anything less in just plain deceit. Its a shame i cant do anything about this.

also @Jinra and @willpark16 when i choose to select the voltage of the cells it shows 42.0.... wouldnt that mean that all are connected and functioning?

You only get 8-12miles from a 4p? You may want to check your settings and battery connections that is very low even with hub motors, my single get roughly 30 and my friends dual hummies with a pro 3 get 10-15

your battery contains strips of nickel that are spot welded to the battery cells, there should be 80 points total where they are spot-welded. check each one and make sure they're securely attached to the cells

i try to balance them once every 3 or so charges

they wont balance right if one or more groups are not 4p because of detached welds. Do you have a multimeter? Check the voltage of each parallel group and see if they're all the same.

well you want each lipo to not go past 3.0, and 3.3 is apparently a sweet spot for battery life and battery health.

honestly mine just died and im still scratching my head as to what happened

## \#63 Posted by: Ackmaniac Posted at: 2017-10-30T13:06:43.350Z Reads: 48

```
If you still have your space cell then set your battery cutoff start to 30V and cutoff end to 28V. Gives you then about 20% more range and you are still safe. And BTW 130kv for hub motors is a horrible gearing when it comes to efficiency. For example for 90mm wheels 85kv is nice for hubs.

But don't do that for LiPo. There you should use 35V and 33V as lowest.

Maybe it's not your case here ..but I've started having shitty range that dropped from 20+miles to about 7-8 miles when one of my motor magnets displaced a little bit and started slight clicking sound. First clicking was subtle ..then it was louder and louder. At the end after I took the motor apart and fixed glued the magnet back in, the range went back to normal.
