Ok this may be a little over on left field.  

I have an Eglide that runs on (3) 12v 12ah SLA batteries, similar to a scooter, or power chair etc.  So it should be at 36v 12ah with the 3 sealed batts in series.  

I have a bunch of extra panasonic 18650's.

|**Brand:**|Panasonic|
| --- | --- |
|**Model:**|NCR18650|
|**Capacity:**|2900mAh Rated|
|**Voltage:**|3.60V Nominal|
|**Charging:**|4.20V Maximum|

1925mA Standard
â€” mA Maximum|
| **Discharging:** |2.50V Cutoff
580mA Standard
5400mA Maximum|
| **Description:** |Gray Cell Wrapper
White Insulator Ring
18650 Form Factor|

Can I make a 36v 10s5p battery with these and replace the lead and not blow it up...  If each cell say delivers 5amps, this would get me to 25 amp discharge for the pack correct?  If I was at 3s I'd be at 15 amp discharge, closer to what is stock with the lead.  Am I safe to go over that?

Sorry this is a weird one.  I don't want to damage the stock speed controller.  I don't mind the SLA, it treks along on the golf course I live on, and I find it very fun...

Yes 10s5p will deliver 25 amps. If you use 3s it's still 25 amps but you are delivering 12.6v
