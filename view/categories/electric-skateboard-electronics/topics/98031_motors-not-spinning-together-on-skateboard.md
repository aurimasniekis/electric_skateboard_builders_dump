I just put together my first electric skateboard. It’s a dual 6374 motor with a Flipsky Dual FSESC6.6 Based upon VESC6 with Aluminum Heatsink, and a 12s4p battery. 

Under the smallest amount of acceleration, one motor is the only one to move. The motors only move together under a quick acceleration while the wheels aren’t on the ground. After test rides the wheel attached the motor that spins up first has noticeably more wear than the other. Both belts and wheels are tensioned the same l as best I can by feel. How do I get the motors to spinning together all the time? Is this a problem or is this normal? 
Thanks!

This always happens and it's completely normal, under regular riding conditions, I mean under load, both motors will spin with the same torque.

The wear difference you see has nothing to do with this fact but with your body weight distribution while riding

Oh okay thanks. First experience with the skateboard and I didn’t want to break something because of a bad setting.
