Hi there,
I am new to the reflow oven buisness. I would like to try using a stencil for a VESC.
Do you have experience with OSHstencils ?
What kind of files should I send them ?

In case somebody here is selling a VESC stencil, I may be interested.

Cheers,
Akira

@chaka makes his VESCs. @RunPlayBack also is making a few.

IMO. I would wait for the new version 6 VESC to be released. It shouldn't be too long before the official release. The boards and BOM should be up on Github. :wink:
