Seeing as both have just been released and are in the same price bracket which is better. 
Both have their benefits but which would you buy and why? 
[poll type=regular public=true]
* Raptor 2 hubs
* Torque boards direct drive

I like direct drive better because of heat dissipation and the ability to easily change the wheels out.

Was considering both, went with the TB DD. Brands don't come in to it for me this time, the ability to swap wheels out and have more urethane and future pneumatic options are just a no brainer.

The fact that Dexter is likely to ship on time does appeal though ;)

Neither 😃, My advice ? Wait. 

In regards to the raptor 2, wait to see if the sleeves no longer cracks and if this new version has all the kinks out  

In regards to the DD, wait to see if it works and doesn’t have issues 

If your someone who likes/willing to tinker out any issues that may arrive then sure go for it. If not I advise waiting.

Can confirm the new outwheels don’t crack anymore, have about 200km on them and they still holding up compared to the last 3 sets I had all cracked within 30km 

The motors on the other hand I had the first batch of the silver motors with the less beefy back truck and they overheat like nothing else. The last 2 sets of black motors didn’t overheat but the first set locked up on me at 30mph and the second set just kept having a clicking sound. Sent back my motors and Hopefully the new version is better.

Id go with the Tb ones but wide hangers look like shit on anything other than snub nose/tail style decks

Really like how the r2 drive looks, with the wider rear wheels  and narrower trucks

Yep. Same here. TB all the way. R2 hubs locked up on me at 30mph and the other broken ones would click, overheat like crazy, ect... I also don't like being told that two years isn't too long of a wait for something that only works 40 miles and breaks down after shooting 20k to the company in a month. ;)

P.S- I have the latest "silver" version that over heats bad and does this weird stall on full throttle before it engages that will throw a pro off.

I got a chance to test ride the 75kv version with new 110mm big wheels. We had it set up BLDC unsensored, and even then they were smooth as hell. Amazing torque at 12S 60/-60A motor and 30/-12A battery... braking was great, smooth, no stuttering... even start from a very slow roll was smooth for BLDC unsensored. 

The drivers go together so easily... install the axles with a dab of loctite, slide on the motors, slide on the wheels and torque down the axle nuts and done. Everything is very solid together, heavy duty, good machining, grade 8 kingpins, no slop in the pivot cup, the cans are thick *AF*- I don't see these falling apart, they felt very stable and they fly on 12S. 

When I get the cash for them, I will be going TB DD all the way. I'm glad they are selling the raptor hubs, considering them, but after riding the DDs I'm in love. I cant wait to try sensored for one, let alone sensored FOC.

15mm clearance and my mounts are still fucked to hell and back when I shred hard... god knows how Long motors will last when I hear crunching sounds every time I go over a ledge...

So right now it’s a dilemma...

Both companies have seen my wallet this weekend. Got good expectations for this TB-DD + UNITY setup. Prefer the look and feel of thick PU 107 Superflys, and because of where/how I ride I have no issue or concern about the clearance. Would think differently maybe if I commuted through the city, but my patch is miles of flat coastal asphalt cycle tracks.

The factory that made the old Raptor motors is the factory that are making the new TB DD. Major quality  control issues meant many motors with faults, just ask @SeanHacker he will gladly detail it for you. That's why we have a new motor factory and the quality is far superior.

We made videos showing both these factories and processes, if anyone wants to get further insights check our YouTube.

Otherwise the "carvon" design looks pretty good! It does seem our old factory is sharing some of the design ideas we gave them, I assume its the exact same stator and exact magnets we used in the previous motor design. So the torque output should be great as its basically a direct copy.

The solid through axle design as used by hummie and carvon is likely a superior design for this type of dd configuration. Torque "master copycat" boards, I'm surprised you didn't take that into consideration. I can only assume you want the aluminum hanger for improved heat transfer.

You definitely need to use these motors with a robust motor driver otherwise you just can't maximize performance without reliability issues.

The heat sink hanger is also a patent infringement which could be problematic for TB.

The direct drive/ hub motors wars are about to begin folks 

@hummie @carvon @torqueboards  @onloop 

Race on! 2019 is definitely the year of the 1:1 ratio drive trains. I'm looking forward to the competition! In the end the consumers win here.

I have been waiting for these wars a long time. Last contender I expect to trade blows would be swissboards but i have not heard from them since a long time ago. Metasurf DD's are a wild card and who knows what to expect.

I am disappointed in the high prices tho, it should be a bit higher/in par with hub wheel prices since they are almost the same concept.

I might have to call bullshit on this:
this is what [patent guys say on the internet:](http://www.bpmlegal.com/howtopat8.html)


 _The "All Elements Rule"  a very simple rule, which says that in order to infringe, a product must contain every single element in at least one claim of the patent. Look at each element in the claim, as properly construed in step one, and see if the product has it. **If you can find even one element of the claim which is missing from the product, it does not infringe**._


This is what your patent says: 
![are%20you%20sure|690x285](upload://mZ5wcrInuxPOgJb1j1SJGP87x0q.png) 

The _in wheel electric motor_ is missing, thus the patent is not infringed.
(I am no expert BTW, just searched on google)

Look, at the end, even with patents, they WILL get copied.

The thing tho, is that you shouldnt care about them, you just keep releasing a **better product**, and get better marketing. If you cant do that then, change your business plan.

@onloop you _own_ this forum. ever thought of making money off it? there are options like crypto mining when they are on, ads, which you already are doing with enertion and its products.

(plz dont make this website unbearable, otherwise people will just create another forum and you completely lose)

Yep. I can confirm. 90% of the motors I've received from your company have sucked. Anyone can go to my YouTube for details. Every time I post them here, they mysteriously disappear. Not worth the time anymore. Been rocking some old TB motors for a couple years though. So I guess they might have a bit more control over QC and quality of product. Who knows. I might just be unlucky like they rest of the people I know with an R2. Who's to say right? Not me of course.

[/quote]

Cool and all. But both companies you've mentioned have had some issues producing under the timelines that you both have regurgitated over and over. And with what seems like an inferior product than what was marketed. Considering 2 years were wasted on what you stated were design, QC flaws, and manufacturing problems I really don't see your point. 

Another thing to mention is that TB doesn't publicly tell paying customers (and prospective customers) to quit bitching when they post issues or concerns. I can explain this in detail also if anyone needs. Between PM's hangout messages, and email its plain as day. In my opinion, the only thing that your company has going for it is your team. They are pretty cool and respectful. CEO's such as yourself shouldn't be posting publicly. You'll learn some day. Especially when there's real money at play. ;)

A lot of people here are coming in hot headed or really biased. It doesn’t seem fair to not give items a chance and call them out just for using the same **factory!** I also want to remind everyone we are a community and we should not put down company’s products because they’re competition.

I think we should wait till customers get their hands on the products and we let the facts fight it out, but for the time being, here is mine:

Enertion has been more open with their motors and what they can achieve. They have been more transparent on their motors than TB has. There is a lack of info on TB’s DD, making Enertion’s hubs, **right now** , the obvious choice. I also believe we are looking only at the motor’s specs, but there are many other factors in play. Some being: customer service/after purchase help and the company’s integrity.

Customer service is obvious so I won’t extrapolate, but what I mean by a company’s integrity is if something goes wrong or the product is faulty, owning up to that mistake.

Outrunners are much easier to make reliable when compared to DD / HUB - all the engineering & refinement was done by the RC guys years before Esk8 started using them.

I think TB will need to start doing some china trips, at least once, i've been there 4 times a year since launching the Raptor 2.

He's got money to blow and wants to see if this new drive will help him get on the road without having to continually send his board in to get fixed or buy a new one. So they offered to let me in on the deal.

There are no allegations of copyright infringement.

i have an international patent pending application and TB knows that he is at risk of being sued when it is approved, yet he is happy to keep infringing & now it is on public record.

The interesting point here is that If you can prove a company willfully infringed on your patent, you can get triple damages.

Jason I love you but copyright infringement, really? So many better battles to choose, none the less that the heat dissipation is only a backup for another piece of heat dissipation built into the drive, I.E. actual air, something the raptor drive lacks and so it uses the truck for basically all its heat dissipation. 

Sounds a bit like frustration on your part as almost 80% voted direct drive, gotta make sure you get in on that sweet cash a small company like Torqueboards is generating because... that helps the community grow... how..?

I get it, you had to put a lot of thought into how to cool a hub drive because for some reason you chose that configuration that's known for overheating. Okay so if you've learned anything all these years as a community leader you'd realize that contributing to the community like Benjamin Vedder did with his original open source designs is more helpful to a community than someone who patents all the ideas for themselves. 

Follow up, are your trucks precision trucks with heat dissipation built in like Dexter's, or on 220mm axles? The answer is they're not.

If you're a community leader you need to lead, not stifle innovation, pull up your jealousy pants and be a friend to the community, not a foe. We should all be congratulating eachother for our growth and innovation as a community and group of incredibly smart and awesome people.

We have an International patent pending, it relates directly to heat dissipation from skateboard trucks with motors mounted on them, TB is infringing on it knowingly & it's now on public record. 

TB obviously thinks its a good idea, or thinks it is necessary to help cool his motors, no? - If "no" why do it at all?

The ball is in his court, he can continue to use the design just has to communicate with me so we can work out a fair deal. If he doesn't want to work this out he is at risk of being sued & nobody wants that to happen.

What makes you think DD motors have fewer problems? any evidence to back this up? 

Motors heat up from the core, the rotor is separated from the core by air. The key is to keep the core cool, keeping the rotor cool doesnt really achieve much.

I gotta jump in here. Having a patent on something that is just common sense and using that to threaten your competition is just plain dumb as fuck. Motors get hot. You are trying to patent cutting some fins in the next closest place to the motor?

I love you Jason, I watch all your videos, ride your gear.. but come on. I don't mean any offense but think about it. Before you have a patent we have people in the forums cutting their own. 

Its like when cars were first invented.. how will we see at night? Lights on the front of the car! You know like the lights we have in our house. Instead... How will we keep hot things cool? How about fins.. fins like we have on everything that sinks heat you mean?

Enertion as a company needs mechanisms to protect IP as it is important for the future value of the company & also is beneficial when trying to secure government grants etc (which we have done successfully). We want Enertion to be around for as long as possible to service our customers so we need to utilise everything at our disposal to survive & flourish. We have trademarks for our Name Enertion & Our Product Brand FOCBOX is also trademarked, We have design copyrights & Invention patents (as do all of our competitors) Unfortunately if people choose to infringe we do need to respond, in this case, we are not looking to be malicious and hope to work something out without too much drama. If some new entity arrived on the market/forum & started using the marks, "enertion" or "focbox" we would also need to respond._

Yeah, carvon really screwed up somewhere, innovating & delivering new ideas is super hard, expensive and slow!

Because of their troubles they have opened the door for torqueboards to slide right in.

Ultimately the market decides who wins & who loses, carvon (@hummie) need to get cracking fast if they want to be in this race.

Heatsink  ->  Heatsink + Truck

You added a heatsink to a truck. They didn't copy your exact design, which I'm sure the chinese will do shortly, so sell as many as you can before everyone is doing it. If this is an attempt at stealing your design, they suck at it.

There is no such thing.  I'd never consider hubs, but DD with real longboard wheels is definitely a part of my arsenal.

***real longboard wheels*** with deep polyurethane and a small core is the key takeaway here

You're lumping those together like it's tractor-trailers (lorries) and station-wagons, because both are used for carrying things...

Patent law is much more about protecting developers, and much less about encouraging competition.

This may not be my goal, or the goal of many on the forum, but I recognize that @onloop and @torqueboards do their development as businesses to generate profit.  

I’d like them to play nice, but enforcing patents can be a touchy subject for all involved.  If Jason is awarded his patent, and it applies to the Torqueboards design, I hope that he an Dexter can hash out a reasonable licensing deal... Like real business do all the time.

That's exactly what my patent application is, its pretty simple to research actually, when did you first see motors mounted onto skateboard truck hangers directly with no gearing? It only happened in the last few years, people didn't realise there would be excess heat to dissipate because there literally were no test cases. We discovered this very early and filed our patent application before another instance of this specific application occured.

With dd the motor and trucks are one in the same. Therefor they would both act as heatsincs by nature of design. 
You have a better shot with patenting your hollow copper heat dissipation design than the fins.

## \#177 Posted by: Sender Posted at: 2018-11-26T05:06:23.872Z Reads: 274

It does seem inherent in any DD or Hub motor design.

Not trying to argue, but wouldn't all hub or DD designs pull heat away from the motor into the hanger to a lesser or greater extent?

I thought for a patent it has to be something that noone else has done before?  It seems like it would be a very difficult thing to argue in a court.   There is at least room for reasonable doubt.


I would hate to see either Torque Boards or Enertion have to invest into lawyers and legal fees instead of investing in new and better products for the industry.  Just seems like such a waste of resources for something that is a pretty grey area.

Or that is what it seems like to me.

@onloop thank you for your passion in this industry. Can’t wait to ride with you. I get your goal. I feel your pain. But I think it just sucks that we need to have a system like this where we can’t see what others have done right and try those ideas with out being taxed. Maybe someone else figures out a better method of cooling that involve fins on the truck, but they can’t afford to get taxed on it. It just seems like it stifles innovation and I just want things to innovate and change as quickly as possible. This is why everything abou the hummie hubs were publically shared from day one.

And tbh, I don’t understand why this was hashed out publically. I don’t think this is a good image of the eskate industry. Maybe a private chat could be used instead.

My two cents.... ? Nah, what's the point. I just hope the UNITY and TB-DD work well together, as I have set of both in the post (that's not strictly true - mean't pre-order!).

At least it should be impossible for the UNITY to be coded so that it doesn't work with the TB-DD, as I get the impression from reading all of the above that if it could be, it would be.

My guess is that this will all blow over, but it's fun to watch for a bit.

You got the wrong impression, I actually want his product to be successful. 

The more DD kits he sells the more focbox unity we will sell, eventually he will make adapter kits so his 5.5mm bullets can connect to unity. (Because I guarantee his customers will pester him for it)

Also, our wheels fit onto his motors... so you will likely see Focbox unity and R-Spec ghost wheels on his stuff.

Not desperate, disappointed mostly and maybe a little bitter.

Dexter is now collecting cash for a motor with same internal electro-mech design as the Raptor 2.0 motor;
1. Same stator, diameter and length, different KV
2. Same magnets (although slightly weaker n42sh)
3. Same rotor thickness
4. Same pcb for hall sensors
5. Same factory that I sacked
6. All whilst blantly infringing on my legitimate IP

he did ad a really fucking massive bearing, that's his own twist.

At least I can go to sleep at night knowing that we where the ones who put hundreds of hours and $$ into prototyping and R&D trying to make a really powerful motor. 

We where the ones that flew multiple times to visit that motor factory to help improve the processes whilst leaving our young family's at home. 

We took all the risk.

Now everyone gets to enjoy it ;)

Good luck to him.

Honestly I'm not an expert, however I have paid experts and they believe we have something unique to patent so we made the comitment to pursue it. 

It's a long expensive road to have a patent application approved but we are already so far along and jumped through many hoops, we can just see the finish line ahead.

Sadly, Trying to protect it is probably not going to make me any new friends though.

That's just the application of the IP, in order to protect the IP you need to be able to prove your IP did not disseminate pre-existing applications... or something I'm not a lawyer. 

Look how well a very profitable company like Dyson has protected their legitimate IP(not). Yet they still do well cause their product is differentiated from the many many Chinesium clones, in fact Dyson are oft-named in the Chinese trade war. £801mn 2017, their profits are boosted by Asian sales ironically..big market which has a love for **premium** brands.

Passion does not always translate well to business. You're clearly passionate and being from Aus you're also blunt as fuck. The mixture is highly abrasive to most other cultures.

People will copy you, that's how this stuff works. If your product is superior and you are one step ahead in development you will shine. Getting upset in front of your customers will likely result in fewer sales.

You've got £540 from me out of black Friday and Dexter got £510. It's that way because the unity is superior to other offerings. Loyalty plays an extremely minor role in modern online business, especially for newcomers to the market like me.

Just make shit hot products and let them talk for you. Patent trolling hurts everyone

This. Any company I've worked for in the last few years just wants to lodge IP so they can take large cases for damages against other large companies or get some licensing $$$ from them if they play ball. I've had zero interest in helping them with that.

I do agree it's a bit rich of Dexter to very proactively peddle his wares on this forum which you pay for, but then I believe it was spawned off from endless sphere back in 15/16 when a builders forum was warranted ther really isn't another forum doing this.

I respect your impartiality & hands off approach in general despite an obvious vested interest, well played Enertion, keep that up.

I'm not actually sure that is true... 

One thing I said to myself when I got involved in this as a business, was;

Something along the lines of;

>Dont give a fuck about anyone else's shit opinions, be true to myself and follow my heart and gut and do what the fuck I like. 

If this makes people feel uneasy its not really my problem. I really only have one job here, that is make the best possible electric skateboard gear I can. If people want to buy it that's their decision too.

The good news is our business is still here and growing where others before us have failed we have managed to stay afloat.

So in sumarry; its very unlikely I'm going to change my personality anytime soon. But it's very likely that I'd buy you all a beer and have a laugh, even if some of youse are a dickheads on the forum.

My patent lawyer basically said the same thing, basically it's a tool to help control the market in your own favour when other business try to rip you. 

So, I'm glad I have the process is underway because now someone is trying to rip me and now we can have a proper discussion about how to cooperate respectfully.

I have no issues with you speaking your mind at all but it looks hypocritical when patent claims start getting used as ammunition. Hub motors and skateboard trucks aren't your original design either. We're all rehashing here.

You got an issue with Dexter using your r&d to make a product? No problem, air that shit. But vailed threats are unnecessary and ultimately make you look like a tanned, semi-muscular bag of dicks.

Get angry and bitter, it'll lead to improvements in your range and if people are truly copying your innovation it'll lead to improvements there too. For a change the shit can roll uphill.

Is that his fault or maybe yours when you decided to go with your design to this factory in China? You made a conscious decision considering it is the best from the business point of view. Now it kind of backfired and you probably knew that it could happen. 
This whole thing hanger as a heatsink is a bit of stretch. Hanger works that anyway and adding a fins is not that big of a invention and I'm sure that if not you some one would do the same thing. Your heatpipe design is much more now of cool innovative idea. Please don't be like @trampa! I will not forget when Frank was doing the same thing to @stewii about housing design and at the same time selling perfect Abec11 clone wheels.
I believe that you'll stay true to yourself and keep innovating and not watse time for meaningless bullshit like patent wars ;)

There's a lot to say but there's not much point. This is most likely the reason why it's out in the public and not private. It wouldn't go anywhere it would ultimately be pointless.

You keep thinking you own everything but everything is readily available in the marketplace.

There is only so much you can work with.

There are only so many stator sizes, magnets, PCB sensors, bearings to work with when you're working between a certain minimum diameter and maximum diameter.

When you actually design your own internals then you can blame the copycat theory. So keep trying to be the first in everything.. so you can keep saying everyone tries to copy you.

I'm the last of your worries. I'm small fry. :fries:

I'm really looking forward to destroying your new drive system. I hope it tests out well because we've smashed a lot of shit this past year and we're kind of tired of the garbage production quality on parts. Somethign like this could get us off belts if it proves as reliable or more reliable and less damage prone than our current setups. 

Hopefully the ground clearance on 100mm wheels won't be the magnet shattering kind, never mind the street reflectors. The 110s look nice though. What formula are those wheels?Are they a standard Lebeda formula or something with characteristics you requested?

This is why we can't have nice things... lol jk. Bring it.. hammers not allowed.

I agree. We should be paying more for higher quality that would last. At the end of the day, what's $100-200 more if going cheap ends up breaking. Formula for the wheels haven't ultimately be decided for yet but should be soon.

Honestly, if people aren't willing to pay the added price for an upgraded direct drive setup.. then that simply just means that it shouldn't exist and I'm perfectly fine with that. That's why it's funny @onloop is getting his panties in a bunch.

We added it up. You're drive system MSRP will be a little over $300 more than my current cost on my drive system, with motors, pulleys, belts, ceramic bearings, mounts included. But i won't be spending time getting things aligned, and more builds could happen in less time. So if they prove durable enough, it may make good business sense to work something out with you. The risk is higher, as one can't simply replace a single damaged component, but if the part is tough enough the risk will be mitigated anyway, along with the other risks involved with a belt drive system such as debris damage to pulley teeth or road debris slicing belts at speed. And people will still get full thane and be able to use at least a small selection of wheels including Boas and Abecs. 

People want larger thane. Personally, i prefer being able to toss my Kegels or Popocas or 90mm abecs on when i like, which was nice about belts and even Carvon's 61mm cans, but the people have spoken and they want larger thane and/or pneumatics, which requires larger cans that can sluff off more heat.

Oh we all already know that. Any one who can do 50 mph uphill will win. And we already know who can do that.

I think it’s funny that he’s using the same sensor board even haha. Dexter, I feel like you, but maybe design your own sensor board? Took me like, 4 hours with zero pcb design experience, to figure it out, design a pcb, and order it.

I think part of the problem is both of you guys are marketing and buisness guys, with a dab of enigineering on top. I don’t buy that you cant do another original motor design. The square locking of the motor of the truck looks familiar (we all know who did that first).

Tell me this, hummie hubs and the raptor 2 hubs were developed at the same time and how many parts do they share? Not a single part. So to say there’s only so many parts is bs.

But don’t worry. I said it before and I’ll say it again. The only real solution is water cooled trucks. It’s a bit of a nightmare. But I think you could cut heat in half easily if done right. Not good for the masses but it’ll win long uphill races that’s for sure.

Well, i feel like i'm cheating on my Candy Crusher with another hot woman of a completely different type, and i'm totally getting away with it. I've been doing beer runs and neighborhood exploring and i rode it into downtown to work today. I like it a lot, i'm probably going to buy one with my tax returns. This one belongs to tishaun fahie, so i have to return it one day. Probably covered in stickers and blood. IT was a pretty serious challenge for me to even get on the damned thing, took like three weeks just to stay up on it, but now i can zip around pretty good. 

But back to the topic, I've already had people contact me about quad rspec builds. This is going to be a crazy build year with so many solid drive trains coming out. We've mostly been an Enertion shop until last year, and now we're only using thier FocBoxes and of course Unity when its shipping without delays. But now we might have some TorqueBoards in the house again. Its been a minute.

Not just blanket loyalty.
[/quote]

I have interesting relationships with a number of vendors. The trick is to stay honest and tell people when they're serving shit on a stick. You really can't be seen as a schill or noone will respect you. One of the reasons I only use Focboxes is because they've proven themselves. Notice i'm using Focboxes on belts, however. When Enertion left belts behind I stole their motors from Maytech and put sensors in them. When they left mounts behind i tried TB mounts for a good damned while but they just weren't right at the time (i hear they're much better now) so i had to get with @okp and get some better ones made. Also, i was rooting for wider trucks but then they came out too damned wide and with an incompatible hanger profile. Nobody had the wheel pulleys i wanted so i paid a guy on this forum to make all of mine. Nobody was making the batteries i needed so i make my own packs. Vesc6 is too big, DieBieMS is too big, fucking motors are starting to get too big... and now i'm going to have to order 100 motor pulleys just to get the 12mm 16T nubless motor pulley i've been wanting this whole time because for fucks sake nobody needs a motor shaft that goddamned long. Jesus. 

All ranting aside.... at some point i guess i'm just going to have to kick start the capital to have an entire system designed from scratch because basically nobody is doing what i want anymore. And if they were, they've fallen down a hole somewhere.

Welp how the hell did this thread happen? BTW just stirring the pot a bit... 

I have a Frankenstein motor in shambles with copper heatpipe + aluminum flange as thermal patch toward heatsink in my workshop since October 2017 at least... Must have already posted it on the French e-sk8 community. Never finished it in a "tested state" though. 

@evoheyax got me the idea in head back then when referring to "Why hub motors overheat and how to solve it". 

Sooo At least in EU an already published idea without having patent application first cannot be patented anymore.

Have fun, I'm eager to see what you big guys come up with. :beers:

Is anyone putting miles on these things already in a way that tests them over time? The only way a competition like this works is if we have unbiased bashing and testing till winners are revealed and design characteristics found to be better over others...All this stuff now is talk, nothing but talk from all sides...to the consumers and people with their money on the line, it's unfair...all this back and forth stuff is meaningless when the urethane hits the pavement for a few thousand miles...we have a very immature marketplace here and no place for answers...so there's no way businesses can blame the consumers for not ponying up for expensive products or creating a market for them when EVERYTHING is unproven (mixed with lots of words) at best...I say...may the best design win...has nothing to do with the words of anyone involved...let the designs speak and the miles in the real world be the test...not the colorful words of any player...good luck everyone!

From what I understand the locking happens because the extreme heat(+vibration) removes the insulation and the windings short creating a sudden braking force. 

I have destroyed motors in my RC cars in similar fashion.

@onloop Just release your own direct drive! The only reason I wouldn’t buy R2 hubs is no support for pneumatic wheels. If you guys made a direct drive with support for pneumatics I bet more people would buy from you than torque boards.

The way I see it the R2 is the obvious choice for urathane, but everyone who has tried pneumatics typically thinks they are better, or at least better for rough conditions and high speeds. Torqueboards may have used some design ideas, but without him we would have zero pneumatic support for direct drive other than a modified Carvon which has production issues. If Dexter can make this product work for pneumatic guys, I am 100% on board.

Torqueboards should focus on marketing a direct drive with pneumatics and Enertion should focus on urathane hubs since they are really different product categories. Everyone wins!

I’d like to add that I am working on my own part time building business in Minneapolis since I am not aware of any other commercial builders near the city. Only releasing a few boards at a time (6-12) but I’d love to use the direct drive if it proves reliable. Already preordered one.

@torqueboards
If you make a good deal and a reasonable price for people who want to buy the motors and other components wholesale it could be a real game chager for builders. Since you not have a mass produced board like the R2, your niche can be quality components for builders and then the builders can market the pre-made boards themselves. I would love to be able to advertise that I use specially designed torqueboards wheels and direct drive motors.

More then anything.. we need to know and make sure these parts are reliable.

@Friskies 110mm hasn't had any issues but definitely want more testing done as well as with larger wheels. We would really need to test it so it's a plan but until we get more results from it. It's still up in the air.

Adding another 15% diameter to the wheel is a lot of extra stress on the motors. Is that extra bit really worth it?  I used to think 97mm wheels were smooth until ii moved to hummie hubs with the 83mm centrax. Keep in mind that urethane has less rolling resistance and effectively no maintenance.

you can see on the sides, the most heated parts are the side of the cans, and i suppose the stator and the axle that would hold it.

Maybe expand the side of the cans to go around the can and touch, _then_ add the fins in there for better heat dissipation, since DD's have limited space to do so

Main problem for simple direct drive conversion without new truck is the width. That trucks is probably more than 35cm in width. Definetelly possible. I ma making 2 DIY DD and one it's a conversion, the other from scratch. The one from scratch is easier than the conversion because you design the parts to fit each other and not make adapters .

Indeed. I've tried to build one before and the axle is definitely a thing to consider. Modifying an existing motor requires a lot more modification, which at the end you might as well just rebuild the truck/axle/motor just for stable performance. In this case it actually cost a lot less than retrofitting a hub to a hanger.

The issue is that high quality parts are not cheap. For example, to even get any break on magnets, you need to order over 10000 magnets at once. At around $2 per magnet, you need serious bucks to drop on them, and even then, the discount is not that great. Same with other parts. You really need like 100k usd to drop if you want to get to a price point where they can get a little bit cheaper.

To some degree, the reason you pay less is your getting less. n48sh magnets are not cheap. But lower it to an n42sh and the prices are much better. The result is a weaker magnet, which ultimantly will mean a weaker motor that's more prone to overheating. To some degree, these are the kinds of changes they make. They might use regular motor wire instead of high heat motor wire also, which would save a few bucks per motor, but the enamel will break down quicker, which will result in a short, especially if you get them hot frequently (lets face it, all hub/dd motors get a bit hot).

The saying is very much true still.. You get what you pay for. It still costs hummie around $200 per motor in raw parts, no assembly factored in. But you'll get the second best magnets on the market, 100% steel construction, NSK high heat bearings, high heat motor wire, magnets glued with specific magnet epoxy, motor winding's dipped in specific motor winding epoxy engineered and produced in the USA, and more.

These pieces are not cheap, and add cost to the motor. But they ensure magnets won't break, the winding's won't vibrate and short, and the epoxy doesn't trap the heat in in the windings  And even if the motor did for some reason get hot, everything can do 300 F before you could see any permanent damage.

You will never find a 2x motors like this for less than $500 (except hummie), because the profit margin would just be too low for any business. But again, you get what you pay for... Just remember, buy cheap, buy twice. Good parts last a life time. Cheap parts are just dangerous IMO.

I'm trying to cut out labor because it's can be done cheaply if you can make the effort to be there in china (look at the raptor 2 for example). But parts wise, high quality parts cost a lot, even in large bulk. Look at how much the bearings hummies using now cost. They cost as much as some hub motors cost... Great bearings though.

I don't have a bit of a doubt that @hummie paid $200 per motor in parts, but how is it that the price at which the vendors buy 6374 is around ~40-60 dollars(alibaba prices)?

Here's a break down:

Cheap motor: n42sh - $4 per motor
Expensive motor: n48sh - $16 per motor

Cheap motor: regular epoxy for winding - $1
Expensive motor: Scientifically formulated in labs for electric vehicle motor winding's - $20

Cheap motor: regular epoxy - $1
Expensive motor: specific high heat magnet epoxy: $10

Cheap motor: Aluminum machined parts - $10
Expensive motor: Steel machined parts - $20

I could go on and on... Having all the tools to machine these parts in house with super cheap labor also helps. But these are the ways you can make a motor that still works, for some period of time. But they are not built to last.

Resistance of the copper is the biggest heat factor in a motor.

A common case is where a motor is too small, the motor say needs 20a to give you what you need. Now you heat up the motor, and the magnets as they get hot, lose magnetism. So as they get super hot, they get weaker. This leads to you needing 25a to get the same acceleration as before. But more amps, means more heat. And that heat is proportional to the resistance of your motors winding. Then, the stator get saturated from the heat and power, and it struggles the iron struggles in the stator struggles to continue fliping the poles. This leads to more inefficiencies, which mean more amps, say now 30a to do the same. But what drives these problems? Heat!

The real solution, is a bigger stator, more copper, and stronger magnets, good bearings, and proper epoxies. There's many other tricks that hummie is researching right now and working on trying. I think another motor type might be the solution, but I need to research more.

There's also the idea of using the truck as a heat sink. I know Jason would like to think he came up with that idea. John and I talked about that years ago with the hummie v1's. And the agreement was that the truck, by accident, not design, acted as a heat sink very well.

That’s exactly what I mean. There’s a lot to learn from their designs. But idk, it might not be practical in a smaller form factor, who knows. I just think everyone is stuck on the same design of permant magnet motors, with one of two stator teeeth count. I think we’ll see new types in the future that could give us better efficiency and torque, like the reluctance motor.

If u could drive a reverse reluctance motor and able to spin it really fast, with a gear which this thread is definable not about, it could work well I think.  Or maybe a really large one would go direct drive but magnets help w low speed torque and maybe you’d need a giant gear with even a giant one of these motors to get similar high torque efficiency. .  Larger..not larger form factor. 

Tesla’s has mags in the stator so maybe some iron loss drag in that but a true reverse reluctance w no mags would have a completely free coast which is highly desired for us.

For a high torque motor in a ...small..size. The bldc with the great magnets is pretty awesome.  I hate that expression form factor.
Wonder if the Vesc could drive it.

Take a look at @JayKay e trucks, they use a magnet less design, don’t remember if is reluctance, I think not since it’s really hard to get it right and also the control is different, if you connect a reluctance motor to the VESC it would not work or at least not properly

The life of gears depends on the type of gear and how it is protected. They can last a long time or very short periods of time. Friction and debris are your enemy. So lube and sealing it off are the first steps to a longer gear life, as well as the gears angles.

The jaykay thing must be tiny power with its tiny airgap diameter and also no magnets. 

  Magnets are good. Embrace the magnet.  @torqueboards has with maybe the thickest steel behind thrm and bet helps.  The downside to magnets is the eddy current and hysteresis they produce creating inefficiency and even drag  when powered or even unpowered while they spin around.  If the magnets were much smaller and all arranged in a hallbach can keep the mag field completely out of the steel rotor n make better motor that way as less losses and heat produced in rotor and magnets and easier coasting.   I haven’t seen ever a top potential magnet bldc outrunner.  Rectangular wire with a stator designed for specific wire and turn count for full copper fill with maybe a cobalt stator and even .15mm laminations at least and the hallbach.  There’s still room to improve theses motors while staying within their volume.  You could even get lighter w the hallbach n removing all steel behind the magnets, if you wanted to make the effort.    But I think the easiest things to improve their already made motor would be to press another layer of steel cylinder behind the magnets, or gluing some thin shim magnets between the rotor magnets making somewhat of a hallbach.  If u could acetone or bake and remove the magnets and build it from a start even better. And get stronger magnets with high heat ability.

what i meant is that we should cool through the sides. As pointed out somewhere in this thread, making holes in the can _might_ make the heat diffuse, but you have water/debris coming in, which make is not worth it.

To fix that you would need a design like @LEVer 's where they cool through the sides. [see](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carvon-v4-torquedrive-closed/65730/135) for yourself

I'd like to see it too! Another way is using a full closed motor, ferrofluid inside and patch fans around the can. Ferrofluid will create a thermal patch to draw heat out from stator toward rotor ; fans will cool down the can and protect the magnets. Double win.

Also will make the motor much much heavier. 

There is also active cooling like liquid cooling, I'm a mechanic and a nerd so I have experience with cars and liquid cooling my over clocked PC. Problem is building a system compact and robust enough for a longboard. 

Because of the nature and space of longboards I don't think liquid cooling is viable.

Best thing imo is to use larger motors my 4wd 6374 barely get warm even after 5 miles of riding on grass and gravel. but I can get my 2wd set ups pretty hot on on the road.

I hope @onloop  have bigger fish to catch. I'll make whatever I want for myself anyways :) 

My point tho is that we as a community could have improved it a lot and everyone would be a winner. With patents and ip just like the phone business it's ruining the community working together. 

I don't think the patent will go trough as it's not  new invention to add cooling fins to something to add surface area to air cool things. This is done in differentials, autoboxes, CPU coolers and whatnot. It's like putting a wheel on something that didn't have it before and patent that it's rolling. 

Just look at the vesc6  and how @trampa is trying to kill all development there with his lawsuits. This is not good at all for our diy community.

I don't think aftermarket modifications would ever get on their radar. You need to buy Enertions product first to use your truck.

Hmmmm... However, older R2 truck and hub owners might have less incentive to upgrade to the new truck and hub kit because a cheaper alternative that takes away heating problems would be available.

I'm sure there would be others that wanted the motors to run cooler or maybe just another design/angle on the truck. If the community could develop something we would eventually get better products but limiting it with legal stuff like this stops developers from bothering with it.

If I where to make these it wouldn't be to make big money off it because I doubt that's possible with such a small market. I think it's fun to play with ideas and diy stuff.. I've bought some tooling to do this hanger and for just that I could have bought a complete new motor kit from enertion so it's a bad idea to make them but it's cool to have made it myself! Would love to make more revisions and cool stuff to sell to enthusiast but who wants to bother with possible lawsuits when there's no money to be made in the first place?

I'll be searching for solutions for the thermal throttling. Because I can't ride my Raptor 2 in grouprides because of the heavy throttling: https://www.electric-skateboard.club/t/enertion-raptor-riders-club/256/2476

Such a shame I have the 10mm axle =(

I was already in love with your trucks when I had the older motors with less throttling issues.

I've got the tools now to run them in M10 but would like to hear from @onloop regarding the legal stuff before I make anything. Would be fun to help out and see if the community can beat the original design but all this patent/ip stuff might ruin that.. 

Now that you have temp sensors in the actual motors it would be much easier to quantify the improvements and test iterations. I have sensors here for my motors but I didn't wire them up yet so I only measure them with a FLiR thermal camera when I tested them.

Yep. That's true. Or used to be at least. You might've missed the not supporting DIY portion of his business model though.  His biggest money makers have been other people's work/designs. Just take the FOCBox (VESC-X) for example. It's what he does and shouldn't hinder others innovation because he wants all the $$$.

You just need to make it clear that they are for a different, niche market, unrelated to esk8. Just put a Teflon coating on them, take some pictures of them grilling some mini hot dogs /cocktail weenies after a hard ride, and market them a portable alternative to the George Foreman grill.

O yea I mean you should patent it.  Or I guess he patents it and then what, he bills you for some amount when you sell it? I can’t imagine he could stop you from making and selling them.  I understood u have to get a patent everywhere it would be sold or something.  Anoying as fuck. And I’ve heard such things can cost thousands and that’s before you start suing.

let’s say for sake of keeping it theoretical @Mobutusan got the grill truck patented but you didn’t care and wanted to sell them anyway, what could happen?  What options? Maybe you could give him a dollar a truck. I doubt he could get you to stop selling them worldwide.   Getting the grill truck patented seems reasonable as its actually  a new or inovative thing but the heatsink truck..every electric motor is trying to get a heatsink on it.  I figured I’d just add a lot of aluminum mass but after seeing yours I like the look and would do it.   
It seems impossible to find a good electrical resistor with good thermal conductivity.  Next want to put the lead wires in the hanger w such a thing

Visually Looks like the copper fill on this motor is slightly better than the silver ones? I do like that they made the bearings smaller because these large ones were so close to the ground they attract dirt and water like crazy

I think so. It’s quite messy tho and loose at the top. That could be because if you look closely a screw has hit the end of the windings damaging the windings. 

Imo the bearings are great. I like them big since it will split the force over a larger area and last longer. I’ve replaced mine with ZZ seals so they seal better than the stock with low friction seal.

Usually people find a rubber seal, like 2rs, is more protecting than the double sided shield ZZ.

Some of the bigger bearings are weaker (seemingly carvon).  If it’s not at least 7mm wide I bet it’s weaker than a skate 608.

Maybe the motor suffer from the vibrations of those many loose thin wires eventually rubbing off their insulation and shorting.

Doesn’t mean we can’t poke each other from time to time and remind everyone that we are also competitors.

Edit: Its not ideal that the customers have to see this bickering, but it’s also ridiculous to suggest we should hide everything from the end users. We are making history here let’s make everything open and transparent so when we are all on our death beds we can look back and remember the struggles that lead to a new industry.
