Is a loop key or anti spark necessary with a Focbox unity?  Do you trust the stock power button that comes with it?

You will not need an sort of loop key or additional Anti spark with the Unity. 

I trust the stock power button, there is an anti spark switch built into the PCB.

Does this antispark handle pre-charging the gate?

I need to redo the video since the audio crapped out in the end.

For this inrush test, added 13.2mF on top of the 3.2mF that the Unity has already, at 58V (14S).

 14S is for test purposes only! For maximum inrush and stress on the switch. You can see the Unity is throwing a fault, that is an Overvoltage Fault because of the battery i am using.

Been using it on an 12s8p battery straight to the unity. No issues at all.
