i have a boosted v2 laying arround.
after good 250km the battery stopped charging.
the charger is good, but it´s just not gonna charge.
i conntacted the support and they said they don´t take over guarentee as i live in russia. I can get the battery to germany for example and from there they would swap the batteries to a new one.
my problem just to get the damn battery out of the country...
it´s expensive and i need a lot of documents.
so, I think it´s anyhów just the bms that give up, but
what if I would make my own battery with a enclosure from @Eboosted for example.
and just swap the broken battery to my DIY battery.
would it work?
the controller in the back part of the deck, so theoretically it should work.

I bet their BMS does some sort of special handshake with the motorcontroller requiring you to use that same BMS they use.

I don't know this, but would not be surprised.

Yeah, @Sender is right I’m pretty sure. The esc won’t work unless it gets good reading from the bms or some crap like that. I would search around for used packs or parts on the forum, you might be able to get a spare battery from someone here

honestly i don´t plan to drive it a lot as i´m switched to my trampas now. so I´m not sure what to make.
It just a kind a sad as i could use it only for 3 month and i still would have guarentee on it.
I could try to bring the battery to my parents next time i fly home, but i´m not sure if it really works well on the airport.
especially as i usually only have 40min to get my connection flight in germany.

Maybe ask boosted if they would be willing to let you open up the pack and check it out over FaceTime/Skype. Then if it is the bms they can just send it to you and you install it

the support totally suck...
they answer to each e-mail after 5-7days only.
took me 3 weeks just to get the answer that they don´t ship to russia...
what i can understand, but why official reseller than can ship to russia...
that´s i don´t understand. the reseller not responsible for the warrenty and boosted don´t shipp in my country :joy::+1:
even if i would open it up with there permission they wouldn´t sent me a replacement, as they don´t shipp to russia at all...

Have you thought of using a forwarder service? For example let them ship to somewhere in the USA or eu and then the forwarder ships it to you. They’re generally pretty cheap.

I just need to get it in the Eu and back. From there boosted will pay shipping and replacement.
I asked here one carrier and it’s about 50€ one way and only if I can provide special documents.
Will ask some other carriers here. Maybe there is a cheaper easy way

I shipped 60 VTC6 cells from Krasnodar to Belgium with EMS if that helps. 0 issues. No questions asked.

Yeah, fedex is pretty lax with batteries too. Ru.nkon shipped 50 cells to me in Asia via fedex

Got my cells also from nkon that’s why I thought it’s not a big deal as long as it’s only shipped by ground service. We will see what prices ems will offer

[This is where I placed the request for the courier to come.](https://www.pochta.ru/courier?utm_source=pochta_ru&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=carousel&utm_content=courier) They call you same day to ask for more details and then, when he is at your house, he gives you the final price. I would say it will be around €30.

I think I paid something like €25

Why don’t you just swap out esc with Vesc it FOCbox?
```

---
## \#16 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-10-02T15:16:14.403Z Reads: 78

```
Because all my vescs and focboxes already reserved for other boards.
And I still have warranty on the board. 
And I don’t want to spend more money than needed for the repair of the boosted board 😅
Maybe I even gonna sell it after it is working again.

I'd sell it what's the point of warranty if you can't really use it since they don't ship to you.

But who want a not working board?

The thing which makes me angry is, that I didn’t bought it just from somewhere.
It was an official reseller. And this reseller officially ship to Russia. So with it i should also get my warranty in russia. But no.

You could just buy a new battery. There are used batteries on sale for $100 in the US. This method will help you keep your nerves!

Yeah I'd replace the battery even if you have to buy it and sell as a working board.

Yes and than try to get it delivered. 
I tried it once when the extended pack came out.
Thought I can buy and let it ship by shipito 😅
Didn’t know about all this battery rules at this time...
Ended up selling it by eBay and ship it locally in the USA as I couldn’t get it out of the us

@barajabali has had some experience taking apart boosted batteries for a diy and another project he was working on. He might be able to help.

Really? I used Shipito to send the Boosted to Krasnodar (Russia). Again no issues.

I'm going to Russia in about 2 weeks so if you can get the battery delievered to Switzerland in that timeframe, I'm happy to take it with me and send it to you locally.

If you ship the hole board no issues.
If it’s spare battery than they don’t sent it.
I tried but they refused to send it with any of there carriers. You can read about it in there faqs about dangerous goods. Doesn’t matter how much wh the battery, if it’s not mounted in a device they don’t ship it. Only by ground service within the us.
Thx for the offer, but I first need to send boosted the defective battery and only after they will sent me a replacement.
Will try to get it with ems to my parents in Germany and than hopefully take back the new one in November when I visit them.

The pack can be opened and bypassed successfully but if it doesn’t charge then it’s useless. You can’t access the bms/charge port/ switch side. All you can do is bypass for discharge

@andy87 I could make you a 10s4p battery and ship it Russia along with the enclosurw you will have 3 times more range than Boosted.

Thx for the offer. Looks like I found a solution to get the broken pack to boosted with a other carrier. So i‘ll first try to take advantage of my warranty.
But you can check your enclosure thread, I would need an enclosure from you, just not sure if we can get it fit 😉

Strap it to a piece of flat wood, add the enclosure and send it. 😁👍

Noob here.  Does anyone know if I can swap batteries on two v1s that i have on my own?  I am happy to resolder wires, but that is the limit of my abilities.  Will any programming be required? will the bms detect no battery during the swap and cause an issue?
