I'm about to begin my first build, and I couldn't be more excited! I was planning to go with the [10S 60A BMS from SuPowerBattery](http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-37v-42v-10s-60a-10x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-267.html), but just noticed they will be closed for business from January 30th - March 1st (just my luck!).

Does anyone have any other recommendations for a 10S BMS rated at at least 40A? I'm based in the US, but am happy to order internationally.

I see the [10S BMS from BesTech](http://batterybms.com/communicationbms/BMS-D298V1.html) is also recommended, but I was having a difficult time ordering from their website, and have also read about the minimum order quantity of 2.

Thank you for any help in advance! What an awesome community.
