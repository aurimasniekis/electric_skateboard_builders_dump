This happened with me when I was building my battery pack but different. I was at the part where I was getting ready to put the connectors on. I was stripping the negative wire and the positive touched my wire stripper causing a spark that made me jump. Note: always tape the end of your phase wires. I right away thought I ruined the whole thing but I went and used the volt meter and luckily everything was ok. Ayyy it was my first time building a pack, now I have some experience and what to do and what not to do. 
Can't you just make another set ?
