Ive got a set, mine measured out to 15.  Not sure why MBS put 15.5 unless it's with the wheels or something.

I'll have to look. I just remember the axle length because it confused me a little bit.

I would stick with wheels from MBS. The linked trucks have a 9.5mm axle. MBS sells bearings that fit their trucks and wheels. 

Not sure about a motor mount for that truck. I'm sure it's possible. 
Diyeboard sells an 11 inch all terrain truck with motor mounts:

You have the risers?

@marcmt88 makes motor mounts for the MBS ATS 12 truck, I sent him mine so he could measure them and I bought a set.

Ok thank you
But I don‚Äôt really want to use the riser bc the board is to high and I think it will be less stable 
What do you think
```

Not really less stable, just feels different. You can actually get deeper carves if you use risers and less chance of wheel bite, which is a real thing when using big wheels.
