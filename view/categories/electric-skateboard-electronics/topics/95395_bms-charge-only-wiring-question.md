![image|666x500](upload://cU6GfmfaB9dw863nhQiqPZ3rtXf.jpeg) I‚Äôve got an unbranded BMS from Alibaba and wondering whether I should connect the charger negative to the C- or the P- ? 
Any help appreciated. Pic for reference

Most the time the -P is for discharging the pack and the -C is for charging the pack. Both of those will be your negative terminals.

tldr: charger neg to "C-" charger pos to battery pos.
