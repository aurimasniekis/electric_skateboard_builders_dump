Hi! My esk8 setup will be 8s 8000mah, vesc, 245kv sk3. So i need to make harness for my batteries to get those two 4s to 8s. Batteries have 9 AWG wires, but can i make harness from 13 AWG wire?

I would go with 10 AWG or 12 AWG at least. It can handle around 50A. Since you are at 8S, you will be running at a higher current that 10S or 12S builds. 

13/14 AWG can only handle around 35A.
