i am going to use a battery with the 
Capacity: 22.2V, 10000mah 25c
or 
Capacity: 40V, 10000mah 25c
i would prefer to use 20v as its smaller and cheaper
but would this be enough to power a electric skate board motor?

I use 6S which is 22.2v and it is good for a first build. As long as you get a motor with a kv of 245 (or around that) you will get decent speed (with the correct gearing). A higher voltage will be more efficient and will get better speed and range.

If you times the voltage by the ah not mah (1000mah = 1ah) you get wh. The more ah and voltage you have, the more wh. 1km = roughly 10wh

Amps are the capacitance of your battery. The amount of energy stored in a pack or cell. Volts are sort of the speed of the energy which effects the RPM of your motor and overall wattage.
