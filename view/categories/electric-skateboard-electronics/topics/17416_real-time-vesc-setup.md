My first eboard build. Can someone please help me with the numbers I should input on my vesc? My build consist of:
Turnigy6374 sk3 149kv (what max power on Vesc?)
vesc, 2X- Zippy Flightmax 5000mah 3S batteries (6S total) (what amps settings, motor &batts?) (What power cutoff) (regen braking) and any other settings that would work good, BTW, the rider on this eboard weighs 190lbs.
 Much appreciated, thank you.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/c/ace893d709397cd3cc92aac638d911ed973cb8a3.jpeg" width="669" height="499">
