Hey
IÂ´m looking for someone with a spotwelder in Germany or Europe who would weld some pouch cells for me or borrow/sell me his machine. The cheapest machines from china are still more expensive then buying a complete battery. 
Got a huge amount of Lipo Pouch Cells that have been used for max. 20 Power Cycles

Spot Weld the tabs and metal pieces together - like 18650 cells

I don't think that will work. The tabs are flexible and to spot weld you need rigid metal surfaces.

I have a spot welder and could make you a pack. I can also solder on a BMS, switch, battery display, charging port, 12v or 5v output etc.
I will also receive some ABS enclosures in a couple of weeks
