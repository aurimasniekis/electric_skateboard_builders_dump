hey guys, im looking to get a 10s3p battery pack for my first build. living in new zealand means that my options are quite limited. looking online ive found two sellers that ship to nz - eskating.eu (shipping is 80 euros :tired_face:), and diyelectricskateboards. DIY's ones are 12s3p though which i think is a bit overkill for my 6374 190kv/vesc setup... but id probably end up going for it as it is cheaper than the 10s3p pack when you include shipping.

do any of you know of any better options? let me know!
