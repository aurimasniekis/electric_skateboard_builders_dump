Was browsing through the forum and came across some asking for pulleys.

Noticed a link in there for 
http://unikboards.com/
Their motor section, I noticed that the motor is the same as the Rspec.

Our motors are 6355 190kv / Maytech. I ride these **really** hard in dual/single 12S/10S and they perform flawlessly. 

Enjoy the shop and happy riding.

Do you have a warehouse in USA or you ship everything from EU?

We ship / same day / from EU. This is like a one man army and everything is managed/built... from a 3x4 square room with a friend of mine; wish we had a proper garage; but that's the fun side of it!

happy riding and thanks for the support!

I think R-Specs are made by maytech as well, so they should be pretty similar
