Just curious if two similar motor would work with each other and if two vescs from two different sources would work and would they have to have the same firmware and hardware?
I have been reading around, having trouble finding answer, any input would be greatly appreciated.

I'm using Two Vescs made by two different vendors in my build and haven't had any issues.  As long as the firmware matches up it shouldn't be a problem.  Ideally you want the same software / hardware version on each VESC in a dual set up.  Just makes life a lot easier.  I think someone on the forum is using dual mismatched motors.  You should see something come up regarding that on Search.  Hope this helps.  Good Luck.

You can always use different motors when you setup up each ESC individual.
