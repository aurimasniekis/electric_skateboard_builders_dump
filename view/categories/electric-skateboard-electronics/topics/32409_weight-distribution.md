Hey everyone,
Going to build my first electric skateboard and one thing that has occurred to me right before I'm actually doing this is whether I should build my board and concentrate all the parts at the back of it, that will help me keep all the wires at the back of the board rather than get them across it to the front. The problem of that will cause the board to be much heavier at the back side and maybe uncomfortable to carry. Is that a real concern?

Thanks
