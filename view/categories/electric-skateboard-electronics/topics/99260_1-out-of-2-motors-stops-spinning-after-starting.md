Hello. I'm new to this. And after the assembly and configuration can not determine the cause of the problem. After the start, one of the motors stops spinning. I changed the motors in places on VESC. And the problem is in the same motor. I disassembled it. But  any visible defects i didn see. I do not know what to look for and how to treat it - please help with advice.
Thanks.
