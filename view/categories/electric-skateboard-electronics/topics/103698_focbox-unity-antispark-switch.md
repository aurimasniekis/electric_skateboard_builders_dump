Hallo!
I am building an 4wd direct drive esk8 !  
2 untiys. But i would like 1 switch to  turn both on or off..
Since i already have a few roll to start antispark switches from Martin sp.. 
Can i put "external ' antispark switch to it and put it on and off with th√°t switch? Without using either of the switches build in the untiys..?
Any other advices reagarding to wiring and or programmering the untiys. 

Thnx!
