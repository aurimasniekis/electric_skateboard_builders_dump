Hi

I'm using Lipo batteries in enclosures that I use for a multitude of things. A wide range of powertools and drone, etc. 
But they are a bit of a hassle to remove from their waterproof case on the board every time I need to charge them. So I don't really use my board that much and would therefor like a BMS for the board.

I usually use the batteries with voltage detectors down to 3.2V and would like a BMS with the same overdischarge voltage. But I can only find BMS'es that go from a range of 2.7V to 3.0V.

Do you guys and gals know of a BMS that does 3.2V or can I use the usual voltage detectors in conjunction with a BMS of a lower overdischarge point and just get an audible notification from the voltage detector

Any other good ideas for a way to stop at 3.2V per cell?  I'm all ears
