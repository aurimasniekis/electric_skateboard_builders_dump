Since i didn't get any reply to my original question on [http://vesc-project.com/comment/782#comment-782](http://vesc-project.com) i'll try here..

I'm using a vesc HW 4.12 with the latest bldc tool to communicate with the arduino using UART(with [RollingGeckos Library](https://github.com/RollingGecko/VescUartControl). Reading values works fine, and also VescUartSetCurrent works.
I'm sure it would be better to use VescUartSetNunchukValues, but i didn't manage it to get it working..

Is there Something i need to activate within the Software, to use the "Nunchuk-control"?

no u jst have to use the "UART" app. The arduino will do the rest.
