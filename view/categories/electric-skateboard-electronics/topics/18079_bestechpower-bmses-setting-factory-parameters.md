People! I need help with setting the parameters of my BMSes for my build.
I am building **6S LiFePo4** board, but want to convert it soon to **9S**, so I am buying both 6S and 9S BMSes.
I am also buying ones that are cheap and small - only for charging, and big ones - which are both for discharge and charge.

@Namasaki already started helping me, but now I am being asked to set the parameters soon, and I need help because I have no idea  what I am doing...
He said it is better to change the discharge voltage detection to 2.5 and same for discharge voltage release, cuz 2.0 is too low.

What happens if I get something wrong??? Will it be a wast of money?
The most important thing for me is the charging.. Do I need to give them the parameters for this too?

Any one here has experience with it and can continue helping me?

Thank you all!

##My Batteries Specs:
Capacity: 4200mAh
Voltage: 3S1P / 9.9v
Discharge: 30C Constant / 40C Burst
Max Charge Rate: 2C

Small BMSes
Due to their sizes, I also bought two others, much smaller BMSes:
9S:

Did u sort this out?

I think @PXSS likes to give advice on low voltage cut-off settings ;)
