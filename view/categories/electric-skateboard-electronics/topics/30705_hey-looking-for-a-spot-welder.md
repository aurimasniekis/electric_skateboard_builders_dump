Hey im looking to get a spot welder. any idea what would be a good one to have 

I dont really know what power should it have or so? And im not looking for a budget one made from a microwave.

Im in europe and looking for something that will last long long time and i might need to solder more than 40 cells so it would be good to not overheat or something

Thank you.

This looks very promising. It would be something I would buy if I was going to build my own pack.
