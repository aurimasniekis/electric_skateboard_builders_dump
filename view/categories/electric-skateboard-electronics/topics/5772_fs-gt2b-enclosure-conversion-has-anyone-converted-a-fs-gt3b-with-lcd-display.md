Conversion for the FS-GT3B would be nice. Any technicians out there could design something to 🚆 transfer matrix. So it wouldn't be so bulky.

The problem is getting info to the LCD. It's basically useless, except for some basic info, so converting it would not be practical.

I think he already owns such a TX and dont want to buy another TX. In that way it would not be useless. 
@XvDarkVAngelvX You should provide measurements of the pcb that a volunteer can design it.

Designing something would take quite some time, so anyone who would do it would be a very kind person. But it's worth a shot. Maybe @FLATLINEcustoms could help
