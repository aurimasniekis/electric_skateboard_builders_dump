Trying to find a suitable one for this [motor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/6374-170KV-Brushless-Motor-With-Hall-Sensor-3000W-Electric-Off-Road-Skateboard-Engine-M10-Motor-Shaft/32920671561.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.23.58f72635p4KYlZ&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_1_10065_10130_10068_10547_319_317_10548_10696_10192_10190_10084_10083_10618_10307_10820_10821_10301_10303_328_10059_10884_10887_100031_321_322_10103,searchweb201603_55,ppcSwitch_0&algo_expid=d31d2649-a0c2-4b6d-870b-7f92d6fc3f2f-3&algo_pvid=d31d2649-a0c2-4b6d-870b-7f92d)

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX60FC5ylTY) is the only video I've seen of this motor btw. Also the wattage is 2880w.

[Here's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v5_FfunHG4f4GlwZ4X1qWys1q7_Pg1y4bRuozzjzCDw/edit#gid=0) the rest of my parts list for those curious. I'll be posting it separately when it's finalised.

Ditch the motor. Get one from reputable vendor.
Focbox is what you want.

check out @dickyho motor mounts on ebay, people on here have been using it and have positive experience about it. Ditch the aliexpress ones. 

I assume this is your first build, I recommend either the flipsky single 6.6 or the torqueboard's. Both are good choices. If you have more budget, go for a Focbox (it is more expensive but even more reliable compared to the flipsky 6.6).

The enertion vesc is like twice the price of everything else is there really no alternative? Also what about this from[Flipsky](https://www.gearbest.com/motor/pp_009112760610.html?wid=1433363&currency=GBP&vip=16738431&gclid=CjwKCAiA_ZTfBRBjEiwAN6YG4SgAh1rxjNM97J-7B9MuZ4KFAXZHkCuRIO22o8jzYngvvPbYCZ8EuhoC_uYQAvD_BwE), (not this exact one I think it might be fake). I'm actually 90% convinced that all these motors are the same with different logos stuck on them. Would a 100A vesc suffice for this given that it says the max current is 80A? I've heard "50% more than the motor" as well as "10% more than the motor" rules being used for VESCs, 25% seems ok to me.

Enertion vesc will keep you safe and sound, it's a really good and a solid option, plus it has a really good usage history.

The alternative is going cheap, use the board for 2 month, everything breaks and then upgrade all the parts.
There is no cheap and good in this esk8 world. 
You can die on esk8. Will you really rely on shady electronics and motors that can lock up, throw you into the bumper of a ongoing car?
Also expect to spend around 100 on safety equipment. A decent helmet is 70€.

Btw when people have been saying focbox do they mean[this one](https://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/FOCBOX-programmable-brushless-motor-controller/)? I think I've been looking at the unity not realising it was a dual vesc. £100 actually seems like a good price.

But do you think it will be enough for the flipsky motor I linked? Motor max draw is 85A 3250W.

This. These are the tits if you don't mind a push to launch. Pair them with flipsky 4.12s for a "possibly eat pavement" build or focboxes for  "Might not eat pavement build"

Those aren't sensored though? Does it make much of a difference? I hear people add their own hall sensors somehow. I'm sure I'm capable of doing so but why go for the turnigy over the flipsky one for 15% more price?

SK3 is the most used motor out there, and probably the motor with the least amount of problems

Flipsky has a bunch of problems, and they are in China, if something goes wrong you are mostly screwed

Ok I'll go with the sk3 then I think and the enertion vesc. It's not too much more than the flipsky motor and vesc.

Need to check out the sk3 first though.

97mm wheels 3:1 gear ratio (as of now).

Which do you think would be better?

Just depends on your budget

Whatever you plan to spend... Double it. That will just be board number 1 of 10 if you are lucky. 

Just an FYI though. When it comes to motors and vescs you get what you pay for and safety factors into that as well.

Yeah was planning on making a 10s4p battery out of 18650s but it seems like some of these motors are asking for 12s. The motorsport department at my uni has all the equipment for making batteries as well and they've said they'll help me out. I'm not sure about the BMS I've chosen though, I'm gonna have to find a new one anyway if I'm going to go 12s. Will probably just go with the most common one for charge only since there's not a huge difference in price.

I'm planning on spending about $700 at the moment which seems fairly reasonable. I don't know much about the enertion vesc since I've actually been looking into the wrong one but I'm gonna find out more.

You have a choice of about 5 longboard trucks you know that right?

If you don't then you need to just look at someones build and do some more reading

Is this so that I have something to mount the motor to? I plan on welding  on the "clamp". Also I should be able  to machine a clamp there are plenty workshops near me.

Yeah but you cant make a clamp on most longboard trucks

And most longboard trucks arent long enough for the motors


Do some reading pls

totaly steal but somehow I don't regret getting the 192kv's not on sale.

How is it that that's 2250 watts and the 192kv is 4000w?

It's not like you somehow get more output from the same input power on the 149kv right?
