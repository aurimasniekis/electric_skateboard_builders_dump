For split ppm, do you have to use a ysplit ppm or can you use 2 separate ppm and connect it to the receiver? 
Like this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpovd2XRKqc?

Currently using this remote with 2 VESC 4.12 from diyelectric

Also, in the forums i keep seeing that people need to cut the 5v line. Which line is that? Sorry, kinda new to dual motor setup

On some remotes, that remote being one of them, you can use 2 receivers.  So you have 3 options:

1) Split PPM
2) CANBUS master/slave
3) Dual PPM (some remotes)

I prefer #3 on receivers that support it, like the Mini Remote you linked.  You'd need [an extra receiver](collections/remote-controller/products/2-4ghz-mini-receiver).

Also, keep in mind that you can have traction control with a can bus master / slave setup.

Yes.  However dual PPM can give you redundancy so if one drive train malfunctions for any reason you have another one still running -- aka: you still might have brakes.
#1 could have that depending on the specific failure, and #2 will almost never have that.  #3 will almost always have that.

yeah, i'm just having trouble setting up canbus. I'm not sure if I fried my canbus or maybe the settings are wrong, but only the master motor spins while the slave doesn't

So it wouldn't be possible to just use 2 PPM and connect it to the mini's receiver like the video right?

For dual PPM, would the settings be the same as split ppm?

For any of the PPM options you can configure each ESC independently so they could be the same, or different.  Your choice.  I've never used CANBUS so I don't know about that one.

So for split ppm would this work?

I don't think so; one of the connectors is male instead of 3 female ones.

I would highly recommend just soldering them though and then coating all connections with some sort of conformal coating for waterproofing

The connector in the receiver itself I wouldn't solder

I think the cutting the 5v cable was discussed above anyway so there

I asked the same question some time ago. More replies than you can shake a stick at.

If you can't solder, you should learn how.  Learn on things that aren't your electric skateboard.

[quote="dareno, post:22, topic:79732"]
Vesc has a female ppm plug
[/quote]

Some VESC have a male.  Some VESC have no connector at all and only pads on the PCB.  That's an unsafe generalisation.

Well don't I feel like the fucking asshole?  You are quite correct my friend the tb one does in fact have a male I believe.  Should have established that first.  I stand corrected.  I will delete my heinous comments forthwith.

@Superflim Most of us went to the new builders forum.  There is more information in the thread for this

https://forum./t/how-to-bind-the-mini-remote/95

You can ask any questions over there
