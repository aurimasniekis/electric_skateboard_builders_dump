Like the title says :D One motor is broken ... I need help figuring out how to fix it. If you guys think that these things are fixable? How? Else, does anyone know where to get a replacement? I think it’s a 83mm 500w Dual hub so a total of 1000w. But only one of them is broken.

Cheers!

Describe what you mean by broken?

Either way, it's likely trashed. All of the cheap china hubs are designed to be replaced, not fixed.

So I noticed that the esc cut off the power sometimes when accelerating- maybe because the broken one started to have problems already? Then after another 100km the board suddenly stopped and only one motor worked. After turning it off it wouldn’t turn on anymore. Had to open the damn thing up and disconnect the leads to the broken motor. Works fine with one but only uses 500w cause the stupid esc isn’t programmable. Maybe I notice some type of rattling in the broken one

You can maybe open it and look for a disconnected wire before you can trash it. It could be instructing anyway :)

Although unlikely, it may be the ESC that's broken.
Have you tried connecting the other motor to the other wires? Just to make sure it's the motor that's broken.

Had a similar thing happened to me where one motor wouldn't spin , but in my case my ESC got damaged. I ended up buying the latest meepo esc and replacing it. But if you are sure its just the motor and you want to fix it yourself you should be able to buy this https://meepoboard.com/collections/parts-accessories/products/90mm-quiet-most-powerful-hub-motor and this https://meepoboard.com/collections/parts-accessories/products/mr30-to-bullet-connector-adaptor

Hey man thanks for your answer! you have a S2 as well? 

So you’re saying that all the meepo stuff is compatible with the S2 hardware?

Actually looking at it: I think the s2 has 83mm 500w hubs and this one is 90mm 250w

If you take a look at this ESC http://www.diyeboard.com/v11-dual-hub-motors-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-p-608.html 
or the wowgoboard one v1

That is the exact same ESC that the S2 has minus the bluetooth interface. I thought about getting one of those and de-soldering the Bluetooth interface and attaching it to the new esc but after looking at the new esc i opted for the one with a smoother acceleration curve and better braking, the auto start is neat too.  The only downside is I can no longer use the old remote and I haven't figured out how to wire the LEDS, TBH i never really liked them and havent tried hooking them up but there might be a way to do it.

For your issue you could get
http://www.diyeboard.com/replaceable-pu-hub-motor-8352mm-450w-for-diy-eboard-p-626.html
and just replace both motors. You will probably need the adaptors  https://meepoboard.com/collections/parts-accessories/products/mr30-to-bullet-connector-adaptor1  or you could always use the ones from your current motors if you can solder them.
