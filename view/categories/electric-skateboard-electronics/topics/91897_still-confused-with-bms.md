Hi this is my second post about bms and i am still as confused as i was...I am planing to build my board in the future but i am stuck with choosing my bms.I will be running my board on 2 6s lipo 20000mah 12c 24cmax batteries in series.2 6384 170 kv 80a motors and for the vesc the focbox unity.What i don't understand is how many amps my bms must be...I am happy to read all your answers:)

I'm assuming you're using Li-Po's but could you post a link to the specific batteries you'll be getting?

If you discharging through the bms its best to have something that can handle the current youll be sending through it so something like 80 amps or higher should be fine

Well, ur battery's max amp discharging is Ah x c (20 x 12) = 240
But this is max discharge, usually it's better to use half what you have to make it last longer.
So basically u have 120 "safe" amps.
What I would do is buy 200 amp bms, because you have 2 x 80 amp motors, which is total is 160amp.
```

```
Also I think it would be safe to use 160 amp from battery, because you only will be using it in very peak situations, which will happen very rarely.
But see what other people say, bc I'm not a big geek in it.üëç

the problem is that 200amp bms is gonna be big, if it's not a mountain board

You can‚Äôt run 100-200 amps through 12awg wire constantly. Your likely barely ever to pull 80A on an eSk8. Constant will be much less, less than 20a. 

You can bypass with the D140 I linked, or get the 80A with eSwitch

but the idea of 2 80amp motors was strange in the beginning)

They dont draw 80A constantly, thats just their peak power. 

Same with the batteries... if you discharged them at their max rate you would barely be able to ride. You can limit the battery amps in the VESC tool, just do that and get an 80A BMS or D140 and dont worry about the discharging.

Ok lets say i go with the 80a bms with the switch how do i conect it if there is no dischsrge?

his bat max is 240 amp, pretty sure he can use 160amp sometimes with no harm for bat

I know that the battery can give out 200 amps but relisticly it will be like 20 amps constant, even though the bms is an 80 amp bms it also has a higher burst rating so it will be fine
```

So we end up with the 80a bms?also can a get any bms with 80a or just charge 80a?

What VESC lets you pull 160A?

@Kostkolama you just wire it like in the wiring diagram (80A D223 version)

If you want to bypass the discharge and not have a switch you buy the D140 version. You wire it like in the photo, but add another wire from B- to your XT60 connector (like the B+ wire).

Why not just bypass discharge and run a charge only bms?

Edit: now i see jlabs suggests it lol

Please pay attention to get a BMS for lipo not lithium ion. cutoffs are different.

Are you ready for huge power? lol. Guys on endless sphere seem to like these. The plus size cousin of the smart bms that's starting to get popular here. Different software, so it's completely different sutff.

Correct. But if youre using vesc cutoffs, it doesnt matter what you use. Vesc can cut it before the bms.

Im saying not saying i know as most of the pros on here, but ive put in my work to know the stuff i know. Starting out, i was the same way you feel. Once i had all the components in hand and could physically see where these connected, it became easy and the "fear" went away. Now, do i still get erky when doing the simplest things (plugging up my battery which is about 9 connections)? Fuck yes lol. But paying attention to what youre doing and taking your time is key

The thing with the power system on diy high power electric skateboards is, you've got to understand everything. It's a huge mountain to climb, but you've got to climb if you want to play. At least so you can not cause fire, and repair things when (not if) they break.

Take it step by step and be prepared to have a box full of fried components as you learn. :slight_smile:
