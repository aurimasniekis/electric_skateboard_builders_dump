Hi! Can you guys help me out? So now I use FOC and love it, but when my battery close to 30/25 % it start some voltage sag, and when it happens, it brakes. For maybe half second, but brakes. I don't like it, it is dangerous. Before in BLDC mode when voltage sags, it was just system turning out for second, just free rollin, no braking. So what I can do in vesc tool for getting those brakes off?

Failsafe is fine, when I turn off remote when throttle pressed- it keeps turning about 2-3 seconds and then just free rollin, no brakes!

Maybe your voltage cut out is too high
