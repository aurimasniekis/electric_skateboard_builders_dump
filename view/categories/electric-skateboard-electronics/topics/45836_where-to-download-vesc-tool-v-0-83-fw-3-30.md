I ruined the bootloader on my new maytech vesc as i did not know the newer version came with one so stupidly i uploaded the bootloader which corrupted the bootloader and now i cannot update above fw 3.30. the only option i have is to use the vesc tool that supports fw 3.30 but i cannot find the download link anywhere. im running on windows by the way

Not the latest firmware, but new enough to restore the bootloader and update using the VESC tool.

You only need the chibiOS file, but you'll need a stlink programmer if you messed up the bootloader.
