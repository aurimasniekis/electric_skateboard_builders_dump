I duplicated the loop key series connector design posted by @DeathCookies (pictured below). When this was originally posted there was a bit of back and forth as to if this series connector / loop key design was correct given that the loop key *wasn't ONLY on the black wire or ONLY on the red wire*. Can someone confirm that what is pictured here will work fine?

I had previously used a compact XT90 series connector that I wired with a power button: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/3/7316c8f8fb9e08741281b1c4a6960026caac912b.JPG" width="375" height="500">

If you are gonna connect the batteries to the left and right XT90s, then it should be ok :) Typically the loop switch is positioned on the plus wire and not between the battery packs, but it should work bot ways :) there was a topic about it few Ice Ages ago :D

Yes, 6s battery on the upper left and one on the upper right. Thanks for the input. I was confident this would work but didn't want it to explode in my face!

With that design, the batteries and loop key can be plugged in interchangeably to any of the the three XT90 ports

Just be sure that your balance wires on the batteries are wired in the same orientation as to how they are plugged into the series adapter. I highly recommend labeling both the batteries and adapter with "A" and "B" so you don't mix them up
