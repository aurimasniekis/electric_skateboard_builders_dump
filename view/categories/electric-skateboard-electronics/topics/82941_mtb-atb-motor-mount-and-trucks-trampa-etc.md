Hey Guys,


i'm slowly but surely turning crazy.

Its still my first try on a DIY board but i can't for the love of God find any suitable Motor Mounts that aren't as expensive as all parts that i bought so far.

If i go for Trampa i sit at 700â‚¬+ Only for Trucks, Motor Mounts and Wheels. That would kill my budget.

Thats basically all i need.
Trucks
Motor Mounts (Wheel Pulleys,Belts etc.)
Wheels
I'm thinking about buying a used Mountainboard deck and adding the Motor Mount..

As far as Motor mounts, i'd like something like this ![c6aa8883a4fc101246d3a28f7ac8686d_720x|690x460](upload://hRswcCGyCLGTBXLxBdOWARwBQkY.jpeg) 

Do you have any recommendations? Would be great if the Shop is inside the EU.
