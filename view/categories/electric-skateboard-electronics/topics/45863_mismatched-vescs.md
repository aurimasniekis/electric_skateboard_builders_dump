I have two hobby king VESC's (hardware version 4.10) but I've blown one, surprisingly through no fault of the VESC. Unfortunately they are currently out of stock, does it matter if I use another VESC, either mismatched brand or hardware version, they're both being controlled by a servo splitter cable so not using the CAN bus.

if you split the servo, it doesnÂ´t matter, you could also use one vesc and a car ESC.
Not sure if you can connect two different versions via CAN..

Between 4.10 and 4.12 you can.
