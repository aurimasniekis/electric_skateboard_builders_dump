Looking at this BMS from bestech - I hear they have a 2 pc minimum and I only need one.  Seeing if anyone wants to split the cost.  The 2 below have differnt model numbers but I think they are the same.  If anyone is interested I will email to get pricing.

@Stef I saw on another post you might be looking for one of these as well<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/d/eded8937838dbafaaab5c75621f27b9f33c65b21.jpg" width="353" height="500">

i'd be interested depending on the cost.  Looking for one Bestech 10s and one 12s for two different setups.

Not sure what the cost difference is between the 10s and 12s but can you use a 12s for a 10s set up.

Here is what Lucy sent over and said it will be about 14 days and 36.00 for shipping (up to 4 pc) only a dollar difference between 10s and 12s.

@sl33py and @Quent17 we have to at least order 2 of each so I am going to wait till tomorrow to make the order and see if anyone else is interested.  If needed I will order a 12S and use it for my 10s so we can have two 10s and two 12s.  I will let you know my paypal tomorrow and the cost right now is 39+9+4 (the 9 and 4 is for shipping) 52.00 for the 10s and 53.00 for the 12S.

Hey guys- I will tally up the BMS orders and email Lucy tomorrow which is their Monday to get a total with shipping. 

I am new at building batteries and this started as a "I want to share the cost" thing but got bigger. I do not know anything about the values that need to be adjusted. Is anyone using this for lipos or any other chemistry besides lion, if so you will need to tell me the cut off limits.

@mmaner 10s - P value?
@sl33py 10s and 12s - P value?

@thisguyhere 12s3p

All please confirm that you are still in.  @PXSS - thank you for helping us out, as soon as we get the values I will get the money from you guy and place the order. Cant wait to start welding some nickel.

After looking at some BMS specs sheets from other places ES, ebay and here the only difference I have seen is the Over Discharge Detection and Over Discharge Release Voltage.  I saw 2.8V, 2.9V and 3.0V for those values - majority was 2.9v and Bestech spec sheets show 3.0V.  @PXSS, please feel free to chime in.  If I dont hear from anyone I will go with 2.9V for this value.

Ill list every ones costs in the morning and hopefully make the order in the evening if everyone sends money.

THis is the spec sheet for the last one I purchased from them and its almost identical to one I got from another builder.  I use them on both Li-Ion and Lipo, relying on the VESC cutoffs.

I also changed the Over Discharge Detection Voltage and Over Discharge release voltage to 2.8V also Over Current Detection to 240A+-40A.  I found these settings in several places on this forum. Let me konw if anyone has other suggestions.

@korryh 

**These are the best settings for Liion if you want to be conservative** 
Over charge detection voltage: 4.20V+/0.025V
Over charge release voltage: 4.10V+/0.05V
Over discharge detection voltage; 2.80V+/0.05V
Over discharge release voltage: 2.90V+/0.1V

**I would personally go for these since I have an adjustable charger** 
Over charge detection voltage: 4.25V+/0.025V
Over charge release voltage: 4.05V+/.005V
Over discharge detection voltage: 2.50V+/0.0625V
Over discharge release voltage: 3.00V+/0.1V

I recommend lowering the over current settings. VESC can only handle 160A. I would set the limit at 150+/- 20A

---
E: I've been emailing with Lucy back and forth through the night. They offer 4 variations of the same board, the settings are not truly adjustable. 

Here's the list:

S8261-G3J
Over charge detection voltage; 4.28V+/0.025V
Over charge release voltage :4.08V+/0.05V
Over discharge detection voltage: 3.00V+/0.05V
Over discharge release voltage: 3.00V+/0.1V
 
 
S8261-G3M
Over charge detection voltage: 4.28V+/0.025V
Over charge release voltage: 4.08V+/0.05V
Over discharge detection voltage: 2.80V+/0.05V
Over discharge release voltage: 2.80V+/0.1V
 
S8261-G3P
Over charge detection voltage: 4.20V+/0.025V
Over charge release voltage: 4.10V+/0.05V
Over discharge detection voltage; 2.80V+/0.05V
Over discharge release voltage: 2.90V+/0.1V
 
101CD
Over charge detection voltage: 4.25V+/0.025V
Over charge release voltage: 4.05V+/.005V
Over discharge detection voltage: 2.50V+/0.0625V
Over discharge release voltage: 3.00V+/0.1V

```

---
## \#62 Posted by: PXSS Posted at: 2017-05-16T16:21:16.195Z Reads: 159

```
@korryh Yes please. 

Here are some differences between the 2 settings. 

---
101CD (the one I want)

-The BMS will not stop a charger unless the cells reach 4.25V. Not an issue if you have a good charger that doesn't overcharge cells and has auto shut off. 

-The BMS will cut off at 2.5V which is 100% depleted for Li-Ions. 

---
S8261-G3P (The one most people here use)

-The BMS will stop a 42V charger if it tries to over charge your cells. Most cheap chargers and knock off rc chargers can charge up to 4.25V which would be bad for your cells. Not necessary if you have a good charger that does 4.20V. 

- The BMS will cut off at 2.8V which is roughly 90% capacity used

---
I still recommend that all of the boards have a 150A current limit as that is much higher than what Li-ion cells can deliver in a 4P configuration.
```

@jaysoncena, @PXSS, @mmaner, @sl33py, @Crushkrew, @thisguyhere

Almost there - They put the wrong quantities down for the 10s BMS so I asked for another quote with shipping and paypal fees and updated quantities.  Also I changed the specs to be conservative for everyone but PXSS since we probably dont have an adjustable charger (yet).

We are getting  
S8261-G3P
Over charge detection voltage: 4.20V+/0.025V
Over charge release voltage: 4.10V+/0.05V
Over discharge detection voltage; 2.80V+/0.05V
Over discharge release voltage: 2.90V+/0.1V


PXSS is getting
101CD
Over charge detection voltage: 4.25V+/0.025V
Over charge release voltage: 4.05V+/.005V
Over discharge detection voltage: 2.50V+/0.0625V
Over discharge release voltage: 3.00V+/0.1V

Also I changed the Over Current Detection to 150A+/-20A instead of 200+/-40A (this is what you are calling 150A current limit - right?)

@korryh @mmaner
From my conversation last night with Lucy, they could do 150A over current detection.

Donna:
For the over current detection current, it is in range, how about 200+/-20A

Me:
Can this be lower? 150+/-20A

Lucy:
it is ok


---
Does anyone else understand what the over current detection voltage is? This was Lucy's explanation: 
"This is the voltage related with current beyond your cells' can handle, then our BMS will cut off the output be detection voltage"
```

I dropped all of the BMSs in 2 day priority boxes yesterday morning. It looks like 3 of them show in transit and 3 show pre post.  Just spoke with the nice lady at the counter and she said that they might not scan att the packages that come in at this location but they will be scanned at the Oakland hub then it will show the tracking.  If tracking doesn't show up by tomorrow I'll call Oakland and see wtf is going on.

It simply completes a circuit, there is no positive or negative on teh BMS switch.  Use a 2 pole switch and connect either leg to either pole and you are good to go.
