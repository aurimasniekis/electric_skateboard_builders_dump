Then buy this amazing Molicel P26a they have a flash sale for 1.99 each. 

https://www.imrbatteries.com/oem-p26a-18650-2600mah-25a-battery/?mc_cid=bc1976dcbf&mc_eid=e052873e92

You could compare it's characteristics vs the Sony Vtc6 with a slightly less capacity 2600mAh

A 10s4p could cost your only USD 80 and will give you 100A of continuos discharge without getting too hot

That's crazy

Asinine statement. Taiwanese co. with locations in Taiwan & Canada, they supply Milwaukee tools amongst others such as the US military 

Just because it doesn‚Äôt say Sony/Sanyo/Panasonic it doesn‚Äôt mean the brand can be discounted out of hand

Have you read the testing reviews?

Also interested in knowing where you are getting your ideas that Boas chunk

Molicel is an old brand, that may have been sold around a few times, like A123. Used to be in high end cordless power tools.

These cells, a few minutes of research yielded:
- liionwarehouse is the exclusive US dealer, so these are grey market cells, may not be "A" grade, may vary in quality, etc.
- liionwarehouse has them for $6/cell (no bueno)
- ru.nkon.nl has them for 4.95euro (3.95euro at 600+ qty)
- outperforms the Sony VTC5A, the discharge king at 18650 size
- vtc5a at ru.nkon.nl has been on some crazy sale at 2.55euro qty 10+ qty
- cycle life at 10a discharge is 500 to 80% (very very good. for comparison vtc5a is rated for 300)

I was gonna jump in on the VTC5A at nkon for some large quantity, but these $2 cells are a way way better deal.

That‚Äôs not really chunking, more like a a gouge, take a chisel to any UT wheel, or a nail or a piece of glass and that could happen

A chunk is where a gouge/cut tears a bigger piece away

Stack those H2‚Äôs, they are a short danger

So if you're stockpiling batteries at a crazy price, what's a reasonable quantity? sets of 40 for 10s4p? sets of 50 for 10s5p or 12s4p? sets of 60? If you get it wrong you end up with like 30 unused cells lol, and have to fill the gap with a different batch of cells, which might have different performance (no bueno for safety).

These cells are great for smaller packs like 3p, which makes the math even weirder.

Currently looking for batteries for my new build. Was linked to this thread by @mishrasubhransu, but then it turned out that the company only ships inside the US and I'm in the UK :frowning:

Then I saw your post and went to nkon to find that deal... but that's only on the ru site. Which also doesn't ship to the UK. If I go to the EU.nkon... they have no deal on. 

Reeeeeeeeeeally annoying! 

Seems to be down to VTC5a @ 3.95euro, or the Samsung 30q @ 3.75euro.

P26As have 25% more continuos current discharge than 30Qs (more torque and power)
P26As have 13% less capacity than 30Qs (35km vs 40km of range on an average 10s4p battery)
P26As are 56% cheaper than 30Qs (Crazy deal)

This might be my favorite battery if it passes all the tests I'm doing

I'd be bummed if I were getting cells at such low voltages, unmatched. Sure they were cheap as hell....

End of discharge voltage 2.5v
Shipping voltage 3.45v

Sheesh I guess I'll fight them on any cell significantly below 3v.

Interesting in the spec sheet, looks like these cells have more self discharge than the usual li-ion cell. They recommend storing at 30%, and not more than 1 year without recharging.

So I charged the 1.3 Volt one to full and now doing a discharge test from 4.2 to 3.0 volts. I am also doing the same for another cell that was healthy to begin with. Draining them both at 2.5A. They both sagged to 4.0V at the start indicating that the internal resistance of the deep discharged cell is same as the healthy cell. Will update this, probably after an hour or so.

They both are equally healthy :smiley:
This pic is from the discharge test of the 1.3volts one.

I just had a look in the discharge graph of the vtc5a and there it would be equally to a 7A load.

I might be wrong, but well was interested what you guys think about that.

Oh and here the discharge curve of the molicel

Yeah, I felt it was odd too. 0.2/2.5 =80mohms. Far more than the advertised 20mohms. But I don't know if that's how I should calculate IR or not.

At 15A they have almost the same curve as 30Q and the same capacity

Even compared with the vtc6, they are just way better when you want to pull lots of current.

Yeah I'm sorry, I had not red all the messages!
Very strange that he 'revived' a 1,3V cell.

That cell must be dead and damaged so hard due the low voltage.
I should never use a cell with a voltage below 2.6V.

Normaly at 2.5A these cells should drop 0.1V.

I think both batteries have been discharged too far and you won't even notice it. The voltage doesn't tell you the 'health' of a cell.

They might 'perform' well if you discharge them at only 2.5A but if you discharge them at a higher rate, I'm sure they will fail..

I'm still quite concerned about the number of **cycles** these will go through and only time or considerable testing will show that...for which a flash sale doesn't usually allow enough time.
IF they are reclaimed/repurposed cells, there is also the possibility they were exposed to out-of-spec environmental storage conditions if for example they sat on some exterior pallet. Being exposed to below-freezing (< 0C) temperatures could also explain damaged and low-output cells.

Some cells were as low as 1v some of them were even 4.1v, this cell is amazing but a used cell was not advertised. 

Hopefully I don't have any issues trying to exchange them for other cells.

I don't know which is more disturbing. 1v could be from long term storage and self-discharge (according to their spec sheet), but 4.1v can only be from someone other than the factory charging the cell.

I'm surprised IMR is not blasting out emails to buyers saying sorry, we'll fix it somehow, etc... For sure their handling of this situation will affect who I buy from and who I recommend.

Do you discharge your cells below 2.6V?
I mean If I need to make a pack and I order cells and 1 cell is only 2.5V and the other cells are let's say 3.4V

If you measure a cell and it's 2.6V rest voltage that means the cell has been discharged below 2.5V due the sag.

I should not use that cell and just won't trust that cell. This cell will never perform like the other cells, it has lost capacity and power due the low voltage.

If you still trust it no problem, just sharing my experience.

You're going to do that?
Or have you had a pack which you always discharged to 2.5V/cell?

At such a low voltage the curve of a cell drops so fast that you won't get much more range out of it by dropping the voltage to such a critical voltage.

I don't care if you do that, I'm just saying that's not healthy at all.

Why do you think bms's have a low voltage protection of around 2.8V?

It's a second protection when your vesc/esc doesn't cutt of for some reasons (unbalanced pack).
Mostly the vesc cutoff voltage is set higher than 2.8V so a bms should actually not cutoff the voltage if your vesc/esc works properly.

[/quote]

It‚Äôs a bit late @AlanZhou  but don‚Äôt do that. Lowest cut off end should be 2.8V. Check the discharge curve of your cells. The curve goes rapidly down after 2.8V which means there is like no capacity left. If you have a slightly drift in your cells you can easily over discharge some of your cells under load and your pack is gone with it. You should know that things before building such a big pack. You also should be prepared to handle a battery fire. I hope this will never happen but you should think about things like this as well. If you live in a house with other families you have a responsibility to others, not only to you. Don‚Äôt be an egoist please! That‚Äôs a lot of energy stored in one place. You should know how to handle it if it gets out of control. This is not connected to the discharge thing, but it‚Äôs a general concern I have seeing people here in last time building bigger and bigger packs. A small fire extinguisher will not be enough to get that managed and most probably don‚Äôt even have one.

My cells came in. First small box was okay-for-the-money at 3.3-3.6v. Second medium sized box not so good. 18 cells 2v or below, some under 1v. The rest are 3.3-3.6v. It's weird, nothing between like 2v and 3.3v. 

So that's 18 duds out of 67 cells tested. Bought 267 cells...

The cells are very clean looking, with the little mark on the negative that Alan mentioned. They don't look like pulls or salvage -- these types of cells are alway welded into packs.

I guess I'll send an email before bothering to test the rest. This is worth a CC chargeback. Hope they take them back. Tempting to sort through them and keep the good ones, but a true discharge test on all these cells will take like months, and it's really not good to use them in high power packs without sorting through them.

This is what I'd expect buying a box of random cells on ebay. Hey if they disclosed the condition in the product listing, it might even be close to a fair price.

Your cutoff should start at 3.2V and end at  3Volts. Your cells will thank you. But then again, you'll probably just do what you wish and that fine. Life will teach you.

* Environmentally friendly, industry first, regenerative discharge capability of up to 1344W. Unlike traditional methods of discharge, which deplete the output battery's energy in the form of heat across a transistor, regenerative discharge takes most of that energy and puts it back into the input battery. In other words, when you discharge your LiPo for storage, you will be re-charging your Lead Acid input battery. The total amount of power that you can achieve is limited only by the amount of current that your input battery can accept, or 1344W, whichever is lower.

If I had these cells, I would fully charge them, measure IR, and do a full discharge capacity test. I'd match each P groups total capacity as close as possible and discard any outlying IR cells, just as if I were recycling used batteries. In the end i'd still build a pack with them but keep a close eye on pack temps. Any cells discharged past 2.5 from the get go I wouldn't touch. This is the process I use when building with salvaged cells.

1: discard any below 2.5, or revive and recycle for low discharge uses

2: full charge (full discharge and second full charge to somewhat revive certain cells, or just do this for all of them, just be consistent)

3: measure IR - discard high IR

4: capacity test - discard alarmingly low capacity

5: let sit for 2 weeks - discard self discharging cells

6: match P group capacity with remaining cells and build pack.

A couple litokala li-500 chargers are great for testing.

15 of 80 below 2.5 most of those way below. The rest 3.3 to 3.6. 
Just got them today and haven‚Äôt contacted imr yet. Not sure it‚Äôll be worth it.

Im going ahead and building a 12s3p to test them.

Too much to ship it back and not worth getting the money back so why not.

None of them have lost voltage and have stayed charged. Im still deciding on what to discharge them to, what do you guys think.

With some doubt to quality and no bms for discharge for cell under voltage protection, keep it very conservative and measure p-group voltage often at first.

Discharge them to 3.3v, meassure voltage discharged, charge them back again meassure cells 100% charged to 4.2v
