Edit:
premise, i am going to build a 10s system since i have a 200kv sensored motor from @eskate.de coming my way.
I currently bought all of the things i need to build an eskate exept for the battery and charger for the battery.
I am going with lipos since they are cheap and i don't have a big budget, just over 100 euros all shipped to italy, any recommendations?
i was thinking either 2 of these in series https://hobbyking.com/it_it/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-5s1p-20c.html for 80 euros
Or, i could buy 7 of these, open them up and rewire everything into two 5s2p packs on my own https://hobbyking.com/it_it/zippy-compact-2200mah-3s-25c-lipo-pack.html 70 euros 

the second option gives me 4400mah 50C 
the first gives 5000 mah 20C

which one do you recommend?

or if you have a different option, gib it to me ;)
Other EDIT: note that since the 3s packs would be 7 i would start the process by tearing one apart and if that doesn't work i will be running anyway a 9s2p pack with the 6 remaining still intact packs...

```
if you are fine with a 9s setup, then maybe take 3 of these?

```
It would be Like 90 dollars plus the shipping from the States warehouse that costs more than the One from Europe... Thats why my choice isn't that big, Remember i have to fit the charger too in the price...
