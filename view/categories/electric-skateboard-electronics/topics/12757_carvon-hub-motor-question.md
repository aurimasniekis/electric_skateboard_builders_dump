So I currently have a single belt drive on 6s li-ion. But was looking into maybe a carvon v2.5 but would a single on 6s work on esc as well. Mainly flat ground as well. I know I would be better on 10s but would have to spend a lot more on more cells.

Hubs work more efficient at 12s. Higher voltage gives less current, less current = less heat.

You could get another 6s battery and hook it up in series to gain 12s. Also a vesc would work well.

What capacity and c-Rating is your battery.
You may get away with it, but you will pull huge Amps.
Another thing is , that your speed will be really low.

running higher voltage doesn't make a motor run cooler.  Esc yes.

I would fear 6s to to low to run the 85kv ....

But would still work

Yea that's what I'm thinking running 245kv with belt just now and it's completely fine but would like a bit more stealth.

I have the v2.5's 
Jerry from Carvon recommends 10s-12s for his hub motors.

It was a higher kv motor that's why
