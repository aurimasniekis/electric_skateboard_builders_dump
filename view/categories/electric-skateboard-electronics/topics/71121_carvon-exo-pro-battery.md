I have a CARVON EXO Pro. The battery says it lasts for 20miles but it doesnâ€™t. It only lasts 20 miles on the slow mode not the top speed mode. The battery is  a * Samsung 30Q 10s3p with 40A BMS/PCM is there anyway to upgrade this battery?

Yes. You could build a new one or someone else could. What is your ideal range?

If I could get 20miles at the top speed that would be great

That sounds right for a 10s3. When something says,  Up To 20 Miles of Range (weight, riding style and environment dependent). It never means top speed mode.
It means riding on eco with ideal weight on flat roads.

A 10s4 would probably be more appropriate if you wanna hammer on it full speed for 20 miles. Getting above 4p also helps with battery sag

10s4p would suite your needs, 3p only gave me 12-15 miles range on my belt drive but then again I don't know what a slow mode is haha

Depends on the power output you need. For example, I'm just under 200 lb and I will only get about 6 miles from a 12s4p. But I'm a unique case haha.

If your a good rider and jam at high speed, I would recommend a 10s6p. Also remember, ideally you want to avoid the lower and upper 20% if you want them to last. So you'll lose some range from that also.

[/quote]

Also,  just to be clear. Short of someone disassembling your battery and trying to make a new one, you won't be upgrading that battery. You'll be looking to get a completely new one.
Were are you located?  There's lots of great battery builders on here. But i would personally recommend @psychotiller.

6 miles from a 12s4p

Whaaat... 6 miles. That's it ? Is that full speed ,100% battery until dead? Building my board with a 12s5. I better get more then 2 miles per p group.....

Well I run 6000 watts peak in 4 motors, on 5%-10% grade hills, at about 200 lb myself, at speeds around 30 mph. Stop from 30 in under 20 feet, and back to 30 mph again in under 3 seconds. So yes, I can empty a battery very fast. Again, I said I'm a special case, haha.

Just out of curiosity, how much range are you getting in the top speed mode?

Right now I am getting about 10mils at top speed, which is about 27mph I weigh about 160

I always approximate each P group as 5 miles. Advertising canâ€™t ever be trusted as itâ€™s based on a tiny and almost weightless person riding on flat smooth roads at a slow speed.

LIPOS!!!! I'm using six 2s1 6200mah 50c. Fully charged to 50v 3 days ago and I have put well over 15miles @ over 20mph+. And after just checking about an hour ago, I still have 44v left. If this range test I have set for tonight succeeds, I'll have put well over 20+miles on one charge.

Those sanyo batterys are slightly better at range than the Samsung batterys.

From 20 miles at low speed to 10 miles at top speed.
That indicates significant voltage sag.
I wonder if that is normal for a 10s3p 30Q pack or if something is wrong with your pack like some broken weld joints.

Haven't done a range test on mine but I'm definitely making a bigger pack for mine as well.

It also depends on how hes riding.  Hill, lots of stop and go at full acceleration.
From what I've read under 4p is pretty much gonna have sag.

I hope I have enough juice to keep up in Vegas. It's my only working "portable" board. And it's heavy even without the battery. I have it as a carry on and it's a workout.

this is probably a dumb question but if I tried to build my own battery in a 10s4p could I use a better battery then * Samsung 30Q 10s3p with 40A BMS/PCM. Could I use the Sanyo 20700? And if any one can point me in the direction of any info on building batteries Iâ€™d greatly appreciate it

@Lm1616 
The sanyos are a bit more $ per cell but have better range and will take more chargers over it's life (think they have slightly less speed tho)
The 30q is the best bang for the buck.
That's why its become the standard.

Building a battery is a lot of work.
Its not impossible.  Something i really want to do myself at some point.
But whem it comes to buying the tools and parts needed to build one battery.  You don't really save any money over buying one from a builder. ( and that's assuming you get it right the first time and don't have to redo anything)
You only really start to save if you're making a few.
Compression packs are an easier option  for building a battery at home.  But i don't think that would fit in you board.

I would suggest hitting up @psychotiller 
 https://psychotiller.com/product/18650-30q-battery-pack-with-charge-only-bms-usa-only
Hes a great builder.  He built mine.
You can probably pay for half of your new battery by selling the old one. 
He knows his way around the Carvon boards and definitely knows his stuff

I for one would buy a smaller 10s battery for my light weight board. 
Psychotiller has had a really busy month (probably because he does quality work so everyone is always knocking at his door)
So he might take a day or so to get back at ya.

There's a few battery builders in NY AFAIK. And Atm, building/buying a bigger 30Q pack is the way to go. You could probably fit a 10s5p on that deck.
I'll be making a 10s4p NESE pack after Vegas for my exo. For future traveling purposes.

EXO is excellent in freeroll.
You can extend the distance by turning off the throttle.
If you dislike such a way of running, I recommend a battery of 10s4p or more.
