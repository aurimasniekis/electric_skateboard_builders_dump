Hello guys.
having issues getting telemetry monitoring my setup.
flipsky dual 4.2 vescs 
bluetooth moudle i have been trying are  - old metr.at BT moudle, HM-10 moudle , bluetooth 4.0 with HM-10 built on it.

my mobile phone is : one plus 5 , android version 8.1.0
app tried: metr.at , ESC monitor , vedders app

none of them above gave me the option to make it work.
my phone can't even find nor connect to the modules.
with old phone i have lying around (LG G5) not sure what is the android version.
i manage to connect to the ESC monitor , but not to metr or vedders app.
obviously i want the newer phone to work with ESC monitor app or metr.at , i prefer not to buy the expansive metr module , also do not want to downgrade the phone android version.

any ideas on how to make it work?

thanks in advanced

```
Looks like your rx and rc is mixed up.
Swap it and it will probably work.
I guess you already set the vesc to ppm+uart mode and changed the baudrate to 9600.
