Hey, guys, I can't post  on the market so I am posting here. Anyway, I am  looking to buy someone's VESC. I am in Chicago. If you are in the united states and willing to sell a VESC please let me know I will take it off your hands. Thanks looking forward to replies!!!

@NNGG That might come across as a harsh comment. What he means @Mikee is that there is very limited availability of the VESC. You will have to pay a lot to get it off someone. You are better off just buying from Enertion, Ollin or Torqueboards. Good luck.
