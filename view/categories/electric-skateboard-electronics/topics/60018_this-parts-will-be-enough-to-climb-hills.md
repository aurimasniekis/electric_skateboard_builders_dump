Evolve only has 3000w combined on there gt boards. It really comes down to if the motors are actually the specs they say they are which I highly doubt.

Yes but evolve also uses a reduction ratio giving it more torque hub motors usually lack torque cause there is no reduction is one to one ratio.

I had blanked on this potion of the equation. You could probably climb the hill if you had a 4wd config though right?

You need either custom wires with super fat gauges, AWD instead of 2WD, super tall diam motors (e-bike size) or a reduction drive on your motors.

Else 30 degrees for skateboards sized standard hubs like Maytech is a no go!
