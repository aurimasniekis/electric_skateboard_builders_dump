Are you talking about the transformer or the spot welder?

The spot welder cost 228 USD :((

I am looking for can spot welding 0.2 nickel strip,but it's too expensive....

Nice, I think I might build one, I already have made a car battery one but i dont like it much...

Have you got a parts list? I think I can order the main electronics from taobao to speed up shipping

The housing looks really nice, did you make it yourself?

Originally I had to spend $600 to buy a spot welder.
This really saves a lot of money.

@MorrisHsu I know this is old but can you show the welding arms? How did you attach them together?

I dont know about others but I feel like there's much more freedom and control when you have both electrodes in your hands

So no pen or arm
```

---
## \#34 Posted by: Indiangummy Posted at: 2019-01-25T00:52:08.730Z Reads: 64

```
Yeah but you need to have both pens set to a certain fixed distance from each other right? Or you just free hand both the arms and use the foot switch to weld?
```

---
## \#35 Posted by: moon Posted at: 2019-01-25T00:52:42.786Z Reads: 59

Distance is not fixed, just close together

And yes

This welder looks amazing.

How did you made the secondary part of the transformer? From what I see there is only one coil.
