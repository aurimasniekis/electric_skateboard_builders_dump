I got this LED switch, but I can't find a schematic of which of the 4 prongs power the LED and which are used the actual switch. the middle two has a + and - sign, but I would assume that's for the ground and +5V am I right?

I've tried it already, but these switches all have different number of prongs most of them either being 3 or 5.

and when I try to turn on the switch while have the eswitch wires touching the NO and C on the LED switch the BMS doesn't react or do anything. is this normal? or I think I got the NO and C wrong

Do you have a multimeter ? If so you can check for continuity when you push the switch in
