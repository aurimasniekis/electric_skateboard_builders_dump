I haven't seen any posts with a good discussion about peoples favorite LiPo batteries (plenty on Li-ion though). I'm curious what battery setup people are running. Make sure to include some info about your setup and how the battery has held up. 

I have been running four [Zippy Flightmax 5000mAh 3S1P 20C](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-3s1p-20c.html) on my first 12s build because I saw them on some other successful builds and didn't break the bank. I am running a single [Turnigy SK3 6364-190KV](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-190kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?___store=en_us). I have been impressed with their output overall, but occasionally wish I had less of a voltage drop on longer hills. I haven't been using them for long enough to say much about how they last.

Floureon hasn't let me down so far. And I have kept them outside on my balcony since September I believe and havent used since.

my favorit is turnygy nano. long lasting, fast consistant charge voltage. cheap. they dont come with big mah and form factor is bit longer than usual.
i cant get them in toronto anymore due to flight regulation.

Currently I'm using 4x 3S 5Ah 25c Zippy Compacts in my board in a 12S1P and they've been working pretty well, two of them are puffing a little bit, but overall there not bad. I also have two ZIPPY Flightmax 3000mAh 4S 20C LiPo's for my EDF jet and there holding up very well even though I'm drawing over 60A at max throttle. For my racing drones I have a Gaoneng GNB 1.3Ah 4S 120C Lipo as well as a Infinity 1.3Ah 4S 70C graphene and they both perform very well, the GNB a little better. I also have a few Floureon 4S 1.3Ah packs and they work but the voltage drop is insane and I pretty much don't use them anymore.
