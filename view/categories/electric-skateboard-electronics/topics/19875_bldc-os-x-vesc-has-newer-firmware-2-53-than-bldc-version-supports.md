Did you change the firmware? Should be 2.18 by default

I just bought the raptor off someone. (I sold my last setup too early, and my Carvon's and raptor 2 are taking too long, so needed a board pronto) lol 
But this is how it came so trying to get it sorted

Did you install the BLDC_Tool from here http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/extended-bldc-tool-with-watt-control-mode-ppm-cruise-control-individual-throttle-curve-and-android-app/12286. Because that's what firmware your vesc's are using. You can use the regular BLDC_tool but you would also need the corresponding firmware for it.

got it. @SeanHacker sent me the link... appreciate all the quick replies.. this forum is amazeballs. a couple other questions though.
1) how are the R-Spec Duals in FOC mode? if it works well, does somebody have saved parameters/values i can piggyback off of?
2)  i just bought the 12mm pulley kit. First of all, does it fit correctly or do i need to dremel the truck a tad, and is there really more torque? Basically asking, are these components worth upgrading to on a dual setup?

IMO, let the dual motors roar in BLDC
