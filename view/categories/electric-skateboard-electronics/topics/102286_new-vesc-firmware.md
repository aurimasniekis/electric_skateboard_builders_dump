Hey everyone. This is my first post. I like lurking but I wasn’t about to leave this up to chance. I’ve watched the vesc setup how to for firmware v3.58 which is what my vesc said but now it’s v3.61. Cool nbd. First it says limited communication will be had blah blah fine let’s just see what happens. I click setup motors foc. First question. Motor size. Cool I’ll guess. Nope. If you choose a motor too big you can fry your expensive motor. I tried googling but came up more confused then before. Long story short which one should I pick? I have a 6374 190kv torque boards motor. Thank you so much in advanced for any input!

Usually, it's medium sized motor.
