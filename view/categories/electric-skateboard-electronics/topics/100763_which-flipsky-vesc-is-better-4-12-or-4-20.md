Hi,
I want to get rid of the terrible electronic provided by Leiftech on my [E-Freebord](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/pimp-my-leif-my-e-freebord/100707).

Problem is I'm a total newb in electronic.

I want to get 2X single VESC +remote + battery and charger.
But it is hard to chose, especialy if I want something available right now (this is the case).

I was thinking about 2X mini Vesc from Flipsky but I don't know which VESC to chose between  2 single [4.12](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/torque-esc-vesc-%C2%AE-bldc-electronic-speed-controller) or 2 single [4.20](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/mini-fsesc4-20-50a-base-on-vesc-widely-used-in-eskateboard-escooter-ebike).

The 4.12 is rated for: Current: 50A continuous / 240A peak
while the 4.20 is rated for 50A continuous,instantaneous current 150A.

They made a page listing [differences](https://flipsky.net/blogs/vesc-tool/whats-the-main-difference-between-mini-fsesc4-20-and-fsesc4-12-is-mini-fsesc4-20-reliable), but as I said: I don't know much about this.
So what would chose and which one do you think is the most reliable?

Any help/advices welcome. 
(but please do not tell me to buy a product available in 6 month, I need someting now as I have already waited too long for this.
Thank you.

74 views and no opinions?
Well, I've ordered the 4.20 as it is FOC compatible.
I hope I made the good choice.

Hey sorry for the lack of responses ðŸ˜…. I'm not sure about the 4.12 and 4.20 bit I am currently awaiting delivery of the 6.6 myself. Good luck with your purchase. I think I'll make a post reviewing the 6.6 after a month or so as there isn't much info online about flipsky products. .

Your best choice should be 4.2 dual plus. It's the most stable version. Between 4.12 single and 4.2 single, 4.12 is more reliable.

Too late.
As I said I already ordered 2X 4.20. 
I need 2 singles as it is more convenient to install on a Freebord than a dual VESC.
Install will be underside, one vesc near each motor (front and rear).

Why the single 4.12 should more stable than the 4.20?
