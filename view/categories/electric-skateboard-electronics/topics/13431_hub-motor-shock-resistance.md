From the pictures I've seen of hub motors, the polyurethane wheel ar  very thin. Can the built-in motors resist shock due to curbs or potholes?

Bumps must really hurt the motors depending on the wheels, I totally agree....

Check out the upcoming Carvon V3. 
Looks like all the load and shock is carried by the wheel bearings and truck shafts just like belt drive.

Hubs are pretty new and there are not many long term reliability test yet.

I think the Carvon is superior in design in terms of ride comfort.
