Hello,

First post here. :slightly_smiling_face:

I'm about to get a Meepo V2 Plus second hand and it's battery is showing some fatigue symptoms.
I found a guy building batteries and he offered to build a samsung 25R 10s2p at a reasonnable price.
Would it be compatible with Meepo V2P's ESC?

Cheers,
David
