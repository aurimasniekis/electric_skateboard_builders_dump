Can someone show a pic or in-depth explain how to connect VESC to Receiver ?
I know it needs male to male servo connector but still I'm confuse with which channel should i plug in and which channel i should plug in for the blind plug and stuff like that

You can probably skip the bind, I have found most come pre-binded  Pix below are switching a GT2B to a 2.4ghz mini-remote
