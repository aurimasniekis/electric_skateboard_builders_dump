Have you checked all cells on the balance plug with your multimeter and made sure they are not far apart from each other? If they have to much difference to each other, the BMS is not able to catch and balance them.
Check all connections again, is everything soldered the way it should be?
On most BMS you have to connect B- before you plug in the balance plug, otherwise you may fry something - could this have happened to you?
