Hey Guys
Because of all the "horror" stories I've read here I wanted to ask what settings I best use for my Board. 
Here my setup as a crude drawing:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/e/fe17a60c8c5e37272c8c21e4ac447a2417b30222.png" width="574" height="293">

Battery B1 & B2 are Zippy Flightmax 5s 8000mah in Series = 1 10s Battery with 8000mah: https://hobbyking.com/de_de/zippy-flightmax-8000mah-5s1p-30c.html
Motor 1 is a 6374 190kv from Polar boards: https://eu.electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/
Motor 2 is a 6374 200kv from esk8.de: http://www.hellray.de/shop/#!/eSk8-de-Motor-esk8-6374-200kV-3-3KW-mit-Sensoren/p/66640988/category=15255001

Each motor is connected to a VESC. 
The VESCs are connected in parallel.

I would now like to know which VESC needs which settings like motor max, max regen etc. Most important would be the settings that could destroy the VESCs or other electronics. I will be riding in BLDC mode for now as I've heard that FOC mode isn't fully safe yet...

Can anyone let me know what I should set where and more importantly, why? I'd like to understand why the values are being set instead of just setting them and having no Idea why. 
Thank you!

Hey @capfirepants I would strongly recommend reading all the VESC FAQ and watching videos on youtube of setup. There is so much information out there and I reckon 30 minutes of reading and watching a few videos would really help you. Good luck

Hey, Thanks for your reply.
I've read quite a lot about the VESC already but my first VESC broke after riding just a little. 
Can you recomend links for me to read about the diffrent values? Thanks a lot.
