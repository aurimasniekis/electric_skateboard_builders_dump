my vesc came with firmware 2.18 bad detection. I tried to reflash the firmware says 2.15 then we installed 2.16 still says bad detection. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/3e7fed3557e93aa37815c31ea9fdf12f0ef8ac47.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fb238c4f4c82443db6d5145c5006db75f1e89ebc.jpg" width="281" height="500">

```
Make sure you insolate them individually... If they where touching while doing the motor detection your drv may be dead

```
make sure the main lead from caps isnt being punctured by a pin on the board
try altering the position of the motor wires a bit as it might be a loose connection from the main lead to the different magnet wires. 
try a different motor maybe it's got an internal short.
