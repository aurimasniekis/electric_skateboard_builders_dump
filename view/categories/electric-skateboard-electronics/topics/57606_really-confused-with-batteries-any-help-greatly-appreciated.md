Hey guys,
I'm going to start my own build over the summer after exams are over and I'm hitting a rather big roadblock right at the beginning of this project - I have no idea what batteries to use.

I'm looking to build a board that can go up relatively steep hills (so have decent torque) but also has a long range (speed isn't really a factor here but I'll favour a battery that adds speed along with everything else :slight_smile:).

I'm completely lost as to what 10s2p etc means so any help clarifying this would be great!

Thanks
Blucas

I searched for a post like that but couldn't find it. Apologies, it's quite early over here atm :sweat_smile: I'll give it a read now and see what I can make from it.

Cheers
