Hello, I have one more question about the VESC.
In the tutorial they say I need fresh Ubuntu.
Is it not possible to do it with an Windows PC?
(Maybe VMWare/Virtual Box and Ubuntu)

If not I will setup an old laptop with Ubuntu.
...
But I already have a computer with these one:

Is it possible with that one? (Win or Ubuntu?)
And how to connect?

And (sry for so many questions), can I really only do copy paste in the terminal?

Thanks Guys!

PS: I am afraid of that Linux things (cd mkdir...), for me it's a travel back in time... Why do someone use it... I mean that not bad ...respect for those who can :wink:... I tried to work with an raspberry but it was horrible, even to set up an wlan with dhcp ips and so on.
