I have a tb 6374 and an ollinvesc, soldered the sensor wires to an connector so I can plug in the vesc and when I do motor detection it sometimes detect the hall sensors and sometimes doesn't, resoldered the wires a couple times and still the same thing, I can run sensored and hybrid and control it but a little scared to actually take it out for a ride at those settings.
A little confused

You might have used to much heat and burned up the sensor.  Or you might need to resolder and make sure you get a lot of contact on the 2 pieces of wire.

It was a brand new motor that was never used, I broke the wire today when using it bc it was loose and duct taped it inside my enclosure without plugging it in and i turned my supercarves a little too much and broke the wires, I wasnt using it atm nor was it plugged in
