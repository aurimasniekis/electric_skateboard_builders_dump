This is what i have
 ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 3S1P 40C x2
HobbyKing® ™ X-Car Beast Series ESC
Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192kv 

went out on my first run today all was great and then after 2.5 miles or so board went dead,
2 batterys are wired in series i would have thought i was going to get 10 to 12 miles
what im asking is should i be getting more miles<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/0/a0003bf63558f14c230cfc13742df073b0da9f32.png" width="281" height="500">

Series give some u 6s 5000mah 
Parrallel gives u 3s 10000mah
For our esk8 applications u should go 6s

so unless i get a better esc to go 12s i will have to carry extra batttery packs to get more miles

Whats your voltage cutoff? Have you checked the voltage of the individual cells?

Also the charger thinks i only have a 5s set up when it should be 6s<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/c/fcb07040fe24cd9e5b00c683814030f7dc6cc119.jpg" width="281" height="500">

You could get 2 6s/5000 and connect them in parallel for 10 mile range
Or if your trying to keep a thin profile, you could try the Flight Max 3s/8000 in series. 
You should get more than 2.5miles with what you have but no more than 5 miles max. 
Also anytime you buy Lipo batteries, you need to check them before using them. Particularly the internal resistance if you have a meter to check it. 
I have gotten a couple packs from HK with damaged cells straight  out of the box.

Battery 1 3s 5000 **cell 1=0** cell 2= 4.2 cell 3 =4.2
Battery 2 3s 5000 cell 1=4.08 cell 2=3.86 Cell3=3.38
[/quote]

Battery 1 is toast. Cell 1 is completely dead. That is not safe to use anymore

Battery 2 is very unbalanced and will soon follow the same fate as Battery 1 if you keep doing what you're doing

Are you balance charging?
You definitely need to use the balance charge mode. 
I think your battery number 1 was defective from the start.

Batterys only had 1 charge on a turnigy p606 charger all cells where the same after charge.

@Namasaki @hornet90 Namasaki and @jmasta hit it on the head, you need to balance your second battery asap but the first one is toast. Just for measure, you can get at least 7 miles out of a 6s setup with the specs you listed but you need to balance your batteries after every trip you make. With LiPos you neeeeeeed to make sure they are balanced in every cell or they are an explosive risk.

From what you posted I think that battery one may just have been faulty if you never have balanced it before. Always take the time to charge and balance your batts at the same time even if it takes longer.

Is that a parallel charging board?
You need a 2x 3s to 6s adapter not a parallel board.

```
this is what i have is it wrong
Turnigy P606 LiPoly/LiFe AC/DC Charger 

The unit is designed to charge from 1S to 6S batteries. It can handle different combinations at the same time, 6x1S or 3x2S or 2x3S or 1x2S plus 1 x 4S or 1x1S plus 1x5S or 1x6S. There is no need to stop the charger when connecting or disconnecting batteries as the battery will start charging (after 20secs) when plugged in.

This charger is only for use with LiPoly or LiFe batteries.

So if you are looking for a new charger then this is the one for you.

Features:
• AC or DC power input
• There is the ability to plug in or disconnect batteries when charging
• Batteries charged via balance lead
• Batteries will charge as soon as they are plugged in
• The display can show the capacity of every battery and every cell
• The adaptor supports the connection at the same time for 6*1S or 3*2S or 2*3S or 1*6S battery
• Only charge LiPoly or LiFe batteries

@hornet90 can you post a pic of your whole charging setup? If you have the main charging leads wired in series, but the balance leads connected in parallel, I think you may have fried one of the balance leads on that first pack. One time I accidentally forgot to disconnect my balance leads from the balancing board on two fully charged 3s packs before connecting the main leads in series, got a nice big spark, and it basically vaporized the black balance lead on one battery. Looks like that might be basically what happened to you. I had to carefully open the pack to remove the fried balance wire, but after I replaced it and soldered a new wire in, it's been fine ever since. It's not terribly hard to fix, but if you're new to this and Lipos especially, I would highly recommend seeking help from someone who's experienced with this type of repair and soldering work.

I ordered new batterys Turnigy Graphene 5000mAh 3S 65C LiPo Pack  x2 they came in 
charged and thanks for all the sound advice ill get around to looking at that battery might be a burned out wire just up to my eyes in work right now,first build just done and some testing done as well<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/8/d8966c7abb5a886515fdba7cf90d58941eabfed1.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/1/b13b974348e0da027d40538e01bd8dd884c1fae1.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Either go with lithium ion batterys or if you cant spend that much go with 2X  6S 5000mah packs in parallel and then get a vesc...you wont regret it at all. With the 6s 10,000mah setup youll get around 12miles

is that right

I'm assuming you mean 3.4v/cell not for the whole thing (otherwise those nice expensive graphene are toast).

graphenes supposedly do not sag much and the voltage drops off a cliff when they're empty.

lipos are different from lithium ion, they have almost no energy left below 3.7v, and if you discharge below that, you may hurt them. Luckily graphenes also seem to be tough.

imo 3.4v/cell too low.
