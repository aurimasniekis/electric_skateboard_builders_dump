So outta no where I got a drv8302 error. Ive been running FOC for 2-3 months no issues until I got no throttle response and checked for errors. Would a reflash maybe fix the issue? Either way every link Ive tried for the 4.12 software for my vesc has led me to a 404...

your physical DRV chip is fried. No firmware reflash will fix a hardware issue.

This is the main reason that I have never tried FOC and never will.
