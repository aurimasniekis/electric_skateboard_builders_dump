```
The board I had started out with flipsky trucks and motor mount and the couldn’t hold the motor in place for shit...now I switched to a caliber truck and motor mount but kept the flipsky gears on the wheel/motor and the wheel gear is just grinding the truck and if I put all 6 screws threw the wheel to tighten the gear to the wheel it contorts something and the wheel cannot spin at all. In test riding, I got it spinning kinda freely but definitely still grinding, after a bit, the entire belt was stripped down to no nubs for the gears to catch on. So now I have a board with no way of working. Do I need to get a new gear set or is there something else that needs to be done. I don’t want to keep throwing more and more money at this.

Do you have at least one speed ring between the hanger and pulley bearing?

Post pictures, more info is better.

Are you tightening the screws in a star pattern to avoid any weird angled loads? Do you have a spacer between your bearings? Do you have speed rings? Can you use a file or grinder/dremel to remove the high spots that your pulley is hitting? Can you tell what the pulley is hitting specifically?

This is what I have, well what it was before it ruined the belt. I only have bearings in the wheels and yes I have speed rings on either side of the wheel. I have a spacer between the bearings in the drive wheel. I’m not sure what to do.

When I put the new trucks on and mounted up the new motor mount, when I rode it, it was making a grinding sound and the whole motor/gear mechanism was making god awful noises. The motor mount is so secure it ain’t ever gonna move so that’s not the issue, I don’t understand why the gear is grinding on the truck/mount plus the belt literally being ripped apart.

do you have spare belt? if so put that on and put your board on a bench and bench test it. don't go fast. just observe where the noise is coming from and film it if possible. it is hard for us to know because we don't have it in front of us and we are just as confused as you are

Sounds like maybe the pulley isn't perfectly centered on the wheel and as it orbits, it hits the hanger? 

I'd try just taking a file to the high spots on the hanger and see if that improves things.

That, or maybe putting the hanger in a lathe and turning it down to accept a third bearing to support the pulley. 

Depending on the design of the wheel core and how well the pulley is located by its screws, the belt tension may be pulling the pulley off center which is causing the friction.
```

this is what i would do. Make the hanger smoother/rounder where is has been grinding.

It sounds like you need a spacer between the pulley and the truck. You may actually have a truck with to short of a axel.

Quite possibly. There are a **LOT** of different pulley designs, some with extra bearings, some not, some that press in, some with screws, etc, that work with certain wheel designs but not others. Make sure if you go this route that you pick one that matches your wheel type.

Ahh ok. So the pulley inner diameter needs to be bigger. I actually had this problem about a month ago. I took a dremel and grinded the inner part if the pulley until it wasn't rubbing over the hanger. You could also grind down the hangers outer diameter instead. I chose not to go that route since I didn't want my hanger to look like shit.

Yup, either route gets him there, but I would sacrifice the pulley over the hanger. I just question how much slop he's getting from the current bolt setup.

The only reason there’s only 3 bolts and not six is because when all six were in the wheel straight up would not spin at all while on the axel

You can tell by the pic of the inside pulley that it is rubbing on the hanger. You need to make it larger.

So just to make it clear @chatherton99,
 
Torqueboard for most parts,

Metro pulleys on a budget

Buildkitboards pulleys are more expensive but better quality aluminium so will last mush longer so that would be my choice.

Probably but only because the wheel pulley was doing funny things.
the resistance where the grinding was too much for the belt so it started slipping, but it had nothing to do with belt tension.
