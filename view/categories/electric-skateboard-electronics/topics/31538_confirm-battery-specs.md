Without causing an internet sparring match what if any way to confirm custom battery is as promised. To be specific I need to validate specifications, quality and condition

I would say drive it. Maybe with some kind of app that logs and shows data.  
That's how I found out my hobbyking lipos are not up to specs concerning discharge rating

Discharge through a charger that keeps track of the Ah drawn, then you can calculate how healthy it is by knowing the cells specification.

Basically I purchased a custom battery from someone on this forum. The seller has been nothing short of deceptive since receiving payment. The battery is now sitting in UPS lock down until Monday thanks to miserly shipping option he chose. Anyway long story short I don't trust him or the product and I am curious how to make sure I recieved what I paid for

I'm open guys it's battery I made for him and he can feel free to post our conversation here, he was given undivided 24hr attention and his battery was shipped within the original 2 week period I originally told him. Everything from then on out was just him being indecisive anyways his product was tested before shipping and works great I have the videos to prove it, whatever he does from then on out is on him. I have zero complaints from my other customers but Nothing seems to be enough for him so he can take his buisness elsewhere

Let's do this will. I'll post our entire transaction start to finish. Indecisive!? ðŸ˜‚ That's laughable. You basically tried to fast talk me and rip me off.

Yea Iâ€™m on your side here.  @Jayallday he cannot control what UPS does with your package, he did exactly what he told you he would.  He shipped your battery within two weeks and your rewound carbon v2 is in your hands.

You don't know the situation at all. As far as UPS is concerned, dude lied about the shipping date but Idgaf about that. This is an issue with his integrity.

I really tried man like you would be surprised how many hours I spent going over and double checking things to keep people happy, I love my customers and try to do them all a favor in one way or another, I can't get carvon hubs anymore really and I was hooking him up but he didn't care. So I'm done he can do what he wants with PayPal but yea this just isn't how I like things to go
