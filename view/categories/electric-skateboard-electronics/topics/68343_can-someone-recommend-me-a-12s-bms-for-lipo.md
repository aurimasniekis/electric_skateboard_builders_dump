Just a quick question.  I'm doing a new build with a  12S 2P Lipo pack.  But I have no idea where to get a bms in the EU, or which type I need to get - especially since its 4, 6s lipos to make the pack.

What can you amazing people recommend!?

OO these look interesting. Hows your personal experience with it? Hows its reliability? and since I know barely anything about bms's, Can I charge all 4 lipo packs with the 12s80A bms?

The bms'es are from besttech, very popular for esk8 :) But I don't think it's a good idea to use the lipo's in parallel, because the parallel cells will only be connected with the balance cables?

I can be wrong though ;)

Thanks for the heads up.  Im still scratching my head trying to figure out the best way to get my 4 6s lipos (12s2p) hooked up to a bms.  as silly me on my first build did a 2x6s setup and ended up over discharging and killing the lipos
