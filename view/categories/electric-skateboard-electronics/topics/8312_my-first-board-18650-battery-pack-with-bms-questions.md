Hello Esk8-Guys,
I am new here and i want to Build my first E-Longboard.
I chosen those parts for it:

Board:
Apollo Longboard Matei Special Edition Komplettboard mit High Speed ABEC Kugellagern inkl. Skate T-Tool, Drop Through Freeride Skaten Cruiser Boards https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0154S3DN8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_MIWVxbW1107CC

Motor: Some Sk3 with 100-250kv

Mount: Selfmade CNC

Now I am looking for an ESC with brake.
(Maybe someone know one who is not so expensive)

But I opened this post mostly to ask for my main question...
I normally wanted to use a zippy 6s.
But now I read the better way would be a Selfmade 18650 pack.
But I never done that before.
So can someone share his configuration with me?
Or can help me...

I want to have 6s about 5000-10000 mah and a bms.
(I only found bms up to 60a but I think I need one with ~100Amps?... Discharge)

Main question is how to wire them when I want to get this specifications. (Like 6s/2p)

I would be very happy if you could share links :slight_smile:

 
Best Regards
```

60 A Discharge should be more then you need

My Friend and me use this [ESC](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__77144__HobbyKing_174_8482_X_Car_Beast_Series_ESC_1_8_Scale_120A.html			). And for the Price it is perfect.

for the configuration of the 18650 Pack just search this Form you should find a lot of info

Thanks for sharing your esc, that one sounds good.
I heard that some esc would brake instantly and too much. How is it with this one?

(I forgot in the first post, I don't want a Vesc because I am from Germany and can not understand all of the things you must configure to get it working, and the price)

I am also from Germany :D

The problem with the hard breaks is mostly with boat and plane ESC because those crafts do not need breaks^^

Since this is a Car ESC you will be fine with the Break They are a bit noise but its not to bad.
