18$
15$

I have another faster charger that does 50+ but this is my get-back-from-far kit. 

My 5ah 12s pack let's say does 10 miles.  This charger will get me..3 miles an hour. 

48.7 volts on the multimeter and the amps fluctuates consistently up and down and won't be stable on the multimeter 

This thing wired with a wattmeter and u can charge 12s and know what's going on. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/aa279b66ccbc213cab79a4183cc0013da3ded927.jpg" width="666" height="500">

This watt meter is on my other charger
