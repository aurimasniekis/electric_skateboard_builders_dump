Yea, the parts will work together, but you wont be able to use the motor's max potential. What kind of speed and range are you looking for?

If my calculation were right, i would have a range of 10-12 Km  and a topspeed of 30 Km/h

I think you will find the top speed a little lower, but it all depends on gearing. The range seems realistic, you may even Get up 17 km on flat
