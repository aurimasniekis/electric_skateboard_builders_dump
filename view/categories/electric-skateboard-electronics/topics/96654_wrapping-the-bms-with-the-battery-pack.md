Is it a good idea to put the BMS within the battery pack and wrap with PVC shrink wrap? I’m using a Bestech D345 that has a couple of heat sinks over the MOSFETs and didn’t know if I could get away with wrapping the whole thing (using for discharge). What’s best practice? I’ve built a 10s3p 30Q pack and want to save space in the enclosure by incorporating the BMS within the battery pack.

All my batterys have the bms in the wrap with the cells. And they were made by psychotiller and hyperion

I personally stopped wrapping the bms with the cells in case i need to check balances or anything else should a future issue arise. It sucks if you do and then you have to cut the wrap to get access to it...and then re wrap again after... I just mount it externally in the case if theres space...or if not externally in the spot on the battery where it would have been wrapped

Yes but you must insulate it. The metal parts will make a short if they touch the welds. Kapton and eva foam are convenient.
