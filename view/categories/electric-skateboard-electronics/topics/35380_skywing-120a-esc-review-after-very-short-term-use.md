I'd really like to see a showdown between this and the $43 speed controller on the other thread. Be interesting to see which is best for a budget board. I've never bought off ali-express before, I assume its the same as buying off eBay?

Similar. Delivery will kill you though, free most of the time but normally 20-40 day. But in my experience it normally comes in around 2-3 weeks.

I've ordered one of these for science...

The thing with the other one is the possibility of more than 6s. That's why I'm thinking about them also

Does this one only run 6s? I didn't see any mention of max voltage on the product page but maybe I missed it.

yes, 2-6s lipo. This would be an alternative to the x-car beast apparently

No its mentioned, and yeah its Rated for 6s though i ran it on 7s but didn't gi further because i didn't wanted to blow it up

Xcar beast is sensored , but in some ways the is better and works pretty well.the breaks are amazing
Doesn't gets hot or something has hetshrink too , rode today and worked really great

An update:

Riding this from morning , drove like 4-5 hours and it works great esc is perfect breaks are awesome.

If anyone is thinking for low budget, just go for it
Its is perfect. It has ramping start and breaks are good.

If anyone doesn't want to spend much on remote
I have made my own custom wii nunchuck remote
That works 100% accurate no drops .

Can contact me

What do you expect in that price? Believe me its soo smooth and is completely usable.its half the price of ftv and is more reliable what else do you need?

Yeah no that's fair enough, it's just, I wanted it for my son & daughter's board and it's easier if you don't have to kick off first with them... We'll see how they get on.

I don't kick off it just starts properly, and as soon as remote is connected breaks are on until a push from throttle soo even if i wanted to kick it wont allow
```

So your saying that unless you have the throttle pulled in it will brake?

Ahh ok I guess that's kinda a benefit then if you start on a hill your board won't roll away lol. You could just pull the trigger in a little then get on and push start tho

Thanks for this quick review I was also considering a cheaper alternative esc and running 6S has the potential to be cheaper and lighter too. I am not asking for insane speeds...

By the way does mean you can never kick off? I like to manually kick off the board before I apply some juice... This won't allow me to do it?

But it has ramping start soo its actually good, it starts very smoothly even without sensors, but i haven't tried with any other remote ,i have programmed  my wii nunchuck in such way that if i dont press z button it register as break , iguess if that is out of the case then may be it will allow to Kickoff(just assuming)

```
using:
Skywing 120A
sk3 6374 149kv
6s multistar lipo
Mini remote
15 teeth motor and 36 teeth wheel pulley
kegels

I can not recommend it.
It goes way too fast way too rapidly to be used safely.
Same for the breaks.

If anyone is interested I sell mine for 20â‚¬ + shipping.

I made that go away buy programming my remote to work perfectly for it! I changed the values soo that i should not start fast rather ramp start soo

Programmable Remote as mine should do the trick

It is programmable. You get a programming manual like every airplane escs do ...mine died after two weeks due to heavy breaking
