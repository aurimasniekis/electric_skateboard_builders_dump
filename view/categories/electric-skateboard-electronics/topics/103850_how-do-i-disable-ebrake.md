Hi i have put a vesc 4.12 in my sons electric mx bike which has a 350watt brushed motor.  Every thing is working fine apart from i think the ebrake is coming on when slowing down.  Ive setup up regen braking to where i want it just the sudden slow down at low speeds makes him fall.
Any help would be great 
Cheers
  
Dc mode 
Adc with a hall twist throttle 
Duty cycle

Strength is controlled by motor and bat min.

If low settings still cause issues, you may want to take a look at the drive train resistance. Belt drive for example can cause enough friction to throw someone forward a bit on esk8 if you let go of the throttle without braking (coasting is not possible).
