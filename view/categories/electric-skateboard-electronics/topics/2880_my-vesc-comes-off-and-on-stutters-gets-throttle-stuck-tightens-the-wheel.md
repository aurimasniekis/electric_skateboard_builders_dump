I run two and one will sometimes not sent any current to it's motor or light up white when I throttle or brake.  It comes in and out.

  Sometimes also it will stick on the throttle with a very low current.  It is just enough to keep me going slowly but it won't stop with the other motor and if I flip the board over it goes full speed and I have to unplug the board.  
Other times it stutters a bit
Once it became harder to turn by hand but was smooth 

I'll unplug and plug back and it will solve it for a bit. 

It seems like it kind of goes away for awhile and I can ride without any problems for maybe 30 min.  And then sometimes it comes back quickly.
