I've got 2 5s batteries that want to connect in series, and from there i want a bullet connector to XT90 with and anti spark. Are they things i can buy or are those parks i need to build myself. Thanks

I also need a charger for the two batteries, preferably so that i can charge them both at once, Thanks all.

You can buy them from eBay, Amazon or hobbyking and probably others too. You will most likely have to solder some things though. A good charger is a IMAX B6 and just you will only be able to charge one battery at a time. For 10s I would recommend a bms
