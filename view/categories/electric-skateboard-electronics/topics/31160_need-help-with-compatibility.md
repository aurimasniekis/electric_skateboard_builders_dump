We can't possibly answer that since we don't know anything about your build.

You said nothing about your battery, then you can't get help with a specific charger.

One of your links is to your private cart on ebay, it shows nothing for us , only you can see it.

Too little info still for helping you with anything. I would recommend reading the "new users guides". 
For chargers, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H12_yTx0uYg

Two 2s batteries would be 4s. You need at least 6s for an esk8
