So I'm ordering some stuff from tb, and i can get 2 of their vescs for the price of 1 focbox with instant replace warranty.

I will most likely run sensored 12s and maybe try foc.

Is the tb vesc good enough or should i go for the focbox?

Not good enough, and DEFINITELY not good enough for 12s FOC. 

I went the route you're thinking of taking and dealt with shipping shit back and fourth and eventually just selling both TB VESCs and got two FOCBOXs.

Spend a bit more now and less headache later.

What problems did you encounter? I'm running 2 2nd hand vescs right now i think from maytech, and never had many hiccups

I have two TB Vescs and I wish I bought focboxes.  I blew one of them recently, no idea how.  Both were running 12s BLDC.  I miss being able to try foc and I worry that one is gonna blow again and cost the money it would have cost to get focboxes in the first place.

i have them on sale right now for $145.

I've been using them for 12S builds since it was the VESC-X and its pretty damn good at it. Don't bother with the 4.12 form factors unless you're buying from Ollin or AXLE.

damn it Damon! no more $135 bargain price?!? I'll definitely get some from you once the V4 motors come in, not going to make the mistake like last time and get them 7 months before motors only to find one was faulty but out of warranty.

yeah the $135 sale was just to dump them and pay the bills. $145 is probably where they'll stay from now on.
