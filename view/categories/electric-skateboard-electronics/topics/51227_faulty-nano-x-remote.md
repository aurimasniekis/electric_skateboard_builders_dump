So I went to get groceries. Switched off remote let the board on. 
Finished and turned on remote. Now the nano x remote wonâ€™t bind. I opened her up and the receiver is blinking rapidly. It should be a slow blinking light.

I tried to instructions how the re bind the remote, no luck there, and also no one that mentions a rapid blinking light like mine.
Contacted Enertion support and they are reviewing it and will get back to me.

Anyone else an idea how to fix this?

Just to eliminate any simple solutions. 

Charge the remote

Make sure your plug is in correctly

Update.
I did that. Same result. Contacted enertion and they were nice enough to replace it. Rapid blinking receiver light indicates faulty receiver by the way.
