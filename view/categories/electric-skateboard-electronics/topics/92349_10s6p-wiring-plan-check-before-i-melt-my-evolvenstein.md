I'm completely rebuilding my old evolve carbon gen 2 AT into an "Evolvenstein." New build will have dual 200 kv motors and a unity ESC...but along the way, I'm building a 10s6p battery for the first time.  I am wondering if I plan to wire the connections correctly. A friend had a look and told me I didn't have the cells wired correctly, that the positive terminal for the battery was in the wrong corner. However, if I put the 6p cells in series as I indicate on the drawing, why can't I put the positive terminal where indicated? Posting my wiring diagram and his suggestion below:

Everything looks fine to me. Doesn't matter which way you do it. If you do like you originally planed, just make sure to use fish paper in the middle of the cells as insulation.

I did it his way though. Used nickel strip for the connections in the middle and folded the battery. My battery got folded a bit weird so that one side is higher from the ground than the other.

Please just make sure to do a lot of research about battery building! Remember to use fish paper on the positive sides and between the P-groups :slight_smile:

ALSO:

REMEMBER CARBON FIBER IS CONDUCTIVE!!!!  Don't put the cells in the deck without insulating them. I remember someone else did it a long time ago and the battery made some smoke.

I like your layout more than his. It's what I prefer to use unless I need to stack cells.

Thanks, Legend! I am doing a lot of research.  This forum is great for that. Thanks for the tip about carbon fiber conductivity!!

Oh and kudos on using proper illustrations for crossing over cables in the diagram.
