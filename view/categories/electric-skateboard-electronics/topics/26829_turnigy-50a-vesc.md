I am not sure if this product is new to the market or has been there for a while.. 
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/catalog/product/view/id/63721/s/vesc

Turnigy started making the VESC (which is open sourced so that makes sense). Interesting.. they are using v4.10 Hardware. They are also selling conversion kits for skateboards, with single sensored motor and recommended 10S configuration.

According to Vedder:

> 4.10 - 4.12 are very similar and use the same firmware. The difference from 4.10 to 4.11 is that I made a trace thicker, and the difference from 4.11 - 4.12 is that I added a capacitor to GVDD on the DRV8302, after what I discovered here: [http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=68](http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=68)

It's funny to finally see an RC company start producing electric skateboard parts.

It's sad because I fear people will buy these, they will fall apart quickly (is that motor mount made of plastic? really?), and associate the quality with all parts on the diy market. These VESCs likely are using fake parts, which means they will break at some point under normal operation. However, when they fail, they will associate this to all VESCs (as I did back in the day with my first 2 enertion VESCs that broke almost immediately under normal operation), but the reality is, good manufaucers (like Chaka) make stable and reliable VESC 4.12s. We need more vendors with quality parts, not more vendors with cheap, low quality parts.

Also wondering wheres trampa to enforce their trademark?

I dont think they plan to do anything for v4.xx hardware. I don't entirely agree that it's bad for the market. I believe more competition is always good, even if the products are shitty. Shitty products won't stay on the market long, and will force their hand to improve the product or bleed money. 

Competition breeds innovation.

I don't see the fact that a major player in the hobbyists space entering a new domain - that being a bad thing. I recall when hobbyking started selling naze32 and particularly entered the drone racing scene which is still very strong running today. As all of my pals looked at it as 'now our special hobby would be spoiled by hundreds of new people'all getting parts from hobbyking.. end of the day the competition dropped the prices down and new models came out too because of competition. We still consider hk to be backwards and slowly catching up with the latest in the market, but that flow of new ppl proved to be a good thing after all.

To some degree, I think this is true. But the problem is that the market is still so new, that the logic enertion used to operate off when they sold the v4.xx, will apply to maytech and now turnigy, which is they get so many new customers, so who cares that a sizable portion of people had an issue with their VESC? tThey will always find new, unsuspecting customers who fall into the trap, likely because they are on a budget). It will be a few years before they monetarily have a reason to improve their VESCs, because their will be better and cheaper VESCs by then IMO.

I think we are finally going to see the actual benefit of the TM after this hobbyking move;
if there wasn't a TM  the huge public of uninformed hobbyking hobbyists would immediately associate the name vesc with poor quality and the word would have spread; 
instead the name vesc will be taken down soon; plus they will have to say "based on vesc..." and this is just free advertisement for the vesc project on the biggest hobby store...

I think comparing drones to electric skateboards is a bit misleading, no offense.

Drones run on a fraction of the electric and stresses that electric skateboards do. It's one thing to sell drone and boat and rc car stuff, but electric skateboard parts need to be very strong, both physically and electrically. My friends racing drone runs at 3s with 1.5 amp ESCs, were talking about 50 amp VESCs at 12s or 10s.

This will be bad for small players, as stated before, and most importantly, I think it will be bad for consumers because the china market already produces a lot of really shitty and cheap parts as it is. This leads people to fall into the false economy, which Jason, I, and many others have fallen into. (not to knock everything that comes from china, cause a lot of good stuff still comes from there. But if your aware of the kockoff kockoff boards (yes, thats a double knockoff), you know what I'm talking about)

I can see (and always have) seen this aspect, and I do agree with that statement. My personal belief though is theirs 2 problems. Fake components being used (enertions problem, according to Jason, with the v4.xx) and the original BOM being used. I think the improvements chaka made have been well tested by now and prove that the mods he's made drastically improved reliability. Vedder refused to implement them, assuming they are using the original BOM, they will have the same problems many other manufacturers have had in the past.

The TM in this case will help to separate, which is great, but I still think there were more drawbacks for the masses than benefits from the TM by trampa of the VESC.

I dunno it looks like a $9 mount to me but let us know how it holds up.  Really the mount was the most fragile/chintzy looking part of the kit to me but if 1 $9 mount lasts more than half the time an $18 mount I guess it's sort of worth it (if your time is worth 0 and you don't permanently attach the mount to the truck)

Turningy "the big player" is no threat for DIY sellers....why ? Because they don't give a shit about making quality products. I can bet I can kill this VESC within two minutes on my bench. Cheap components ..cheap parts ..no love put into the product ..just low attractive price for entry level guys who will fall under @onloop 's theory of "FALSE ECONOMY" ..they will buy this VESC .they will run it for a few weeks until it dies ..then they will go and buy vesc from Chaka or Axle or Focbox vesc.

Not sure why Turnigy would risk using fake components? I have two Turnigy RC helicopter ESCs which have been flawless since 2008.

It's totally weird that they are using VESC HW 4.10 instead of 4.12. That's more concerning to me.

I've been running two Turnigy ESCs in my RC helicopters since 2008 which have been flawless. 

I'm against Turnigy producing and selling VESCs as **I'd rather support small, e-skate focused companies**, but saying Turnigy VESCs are poor quality isn't honest or true until we have data to backup these claims up.

It's not difficult to kill _any_ VESC as they're a beta product.

I agree with your points. HK is a hit and miss, most of their products are addressing some markets needs at low costs. In certain cases you would prefer to buy from different vendors out there; if it because of proven reliability, supporting smaller players,  or whatever reason. 

HK quality is fine. And even though their customer care is a pain in the behind, it is still very possible to return products, claim warranty and ask refunds where applicable. As opposed to little players, it is much less painful for them to fix your issue, sometimes at a loss, that's mainly because they sell in masses.  They usually do not cut corners but still would provide you the minimum package for the cheap price they charge. For example in the eSkate conversion kit, they offer velcro straps instead of a proper battery box (WTH?!).  All of that to lower their costs. Still, I am sure they use okay components.

evoheyax not having a go just fyi we (the drone racing community) are all on at least 4 cell these days, if not 5 or 6 now and we can wipe out a 1500mah in a minute,plus reach over a 100mph in a couple of seconds...
I can definitely see the comparisons between these and drones, its what has brought me to giving this a crack, i did laugh when i saw an f4 on the esc's though, we only use them for flight control at the mo, it's nuts having that on an esc :slight_smile: 
I've been struggling to find 2 vesc's for my rig and have some ties with the hobbyking crew so i've been considering trying these. what would you or anyone else recommend as an alternative, that's not too expensive

Just throwing (another) 2 cents here: recently had a big order with hobbyking and there were faulty items. To their credit, they resolved my issue in less than an hour (!!!!) and sent me replacement items, no additional costs and no further questions asked. So I can attest to their honesty and efficiency. 

That is the advantage of dealing with large suppliers. as I said earlier, they deal with masses and small replacements like this are not worth their time or damaging their reputation.

Good news about emax, dys can bugger off though. Had too many of their Escs set alight on me I've vowed never again.
When big business got into the drone community the big positive was the price drop, but also the service, product innovation, delivery times... everything was improved. It costs about a third of what it did, kit performs better and lasts longer.
I know the developers will be worried about getting cloned etc but the big names in the early drone biz have managed to stay afloat and even thrive in spite of this, they've just got to up their game to meet the demand
At the mo nearly 300 dollars for 2 Escs that are hard to find and constantly on back order is crazy.
I got my board today, yet it could still be a month before I can kit it out wtf!

I got in touch with Toby Osmond and Ian MacGregor from HobbyKing. They were very responsive and nice.
The VESC-Product is offline now. There is no intention to clash with the TM.
Ian apologized for using the TM. They were not aware of the fact, nor do they want to harm an OS-Project.
We agreed to have a conference on Monday to find a suitable solution for HK.

So if you want to order a HobbyKing HW4.xx esc, you might need some patience, 
until the issue is solved and the product is online again, using a suitable new branding. 

I thought it is better to post this, before any speculations arise why the product is offline.

Enjoy your weekend, Frank

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/motor-mount-5.html they are on back order not sure how this is Frank's problem?  If you don't protect your copyrights or other trademarks then the courts see that as allowing it.... also why should hobby king benefit from the brand they didn't create and aren't contributing to?  If they pay Vedder or others who are working on the VESC and are given some limited rights to use the trademark in their advertising it's different from just grabbing a trademarked name and slapping it on your product.  If those who do R&D and put in the time and money don't get any pay-out then it isn't worth the risk to do the R&D so no (or inferior) product.

@jotatsu yup as far as I know it's just a matter of using the trademarked name.

Legally, yeah. But I would not buy from them if they're not giving back to Vedder, and I would highly discourage others as well (as I do with maytech). Generally they don't give back because they're trying to undercut it so much that they don't have any room in the price to give back. Frankly, most of those end up having issues because they have to cut corners somewhere (looking at you maytech). Buy from someone reputibale and you'll have a much lower chance of smoking something or even eating pavement/dirt due to a fault.

Well the thing with "corporate donations" so to speak for Open projects (at least coming from the world of software) is that when you donate to the company to donate to a third party you lose control of the donation and the company can do whatever they want with the extra money. It's not a donation really, they are just bumping the price and saying that they are gonna donate maybe to the third party, not binding, maybe the OSS license have a loophole,  IANAL etc. 

For me (not saying is the best thing in the world) is:

- You put your project OSS and OSH instead of going commercial or dual license or w/e, then incoming money is a plus, not mandatory (donations, etc). There are some models that work in the way of doing money here, but you have to be upfront about them (maybe charge for software and not for hardware? or the other way?, maybe use a license that if the implementation is for profit you charge?)

- You are a company using a OSS or OSH, these guys lower your R&D budget so you donate part of that money to the creator or use those resources to improve the original project and contribute to the OSS/OSH. You credit the creator and encourage others to donate.

- You are an individual using the OSS or OSH, if you can’t contribute with the original project because reasons (knowledge, time, etc), you donate a little money to the creator. If you can you contribute to the project (even testing, suggesting and reporting problems is valuable)


I come from the world of OSS, and I’ve done the three. And also I’ve seen people that under a good Samaritan banner end up damaging or taking an OSS back to proprietary.

As for Chinese companies, they live under a hypercompetitive cut price environment, which is a really funny in contrast with west companies that  say that can charge 5x or 10x because "we are so quality", that in part they are, but also they hide that those prices are because logistics inefficiencies (because unless you are completely vertical,  some stuff is going to come from somewhere, most of the time China), high salaries, taxes and because they want more profit per unit  as they don’t move volume.

Well put. I personally only recommend a few (who aren't large corporations, IMHO): ollinboard/chaka, diy, axle, and sometimes enertion, as I think they are giving back properly (enertion has done a lot for exposure and does host this forum, though he has said that he doesn't donate monetarily directly to Benjamin)

If you do a simple search like "Diy vesc" or "torqueboards vesc", you will find 100+ threads about it...

I promise - I really did.  But I didn't realize that diyelectricskateboad.com was the same as Torqueboard.  I also managed to somehow confuse myself with the search feature.  Sorry - truly.

As it turns out a friend donated two ESC's to me today.  They're Spin Pro Opto 300's.  Not sure if they'll be suitable for my 6S electric mountain board.  I'll do a search now :)

he donated you a good amount of money - they´re expensive!
Sounds really nice with all these features like different throttle curves incl. brakes and suitable up to 14s, 220A cont.
Should work well!

Yeah - they've got a ton of them from a personal flying vehicle they designed.  The prototype version of the vehicle is retired, so these ESC's are collecting dust.  Unfortunately I don't yet know enough about programming it for my particular purpose.  It seems I may need to buy a "spin box" to do the programming, and even then I'm a bit nervous that I'll mess up some setting and let the smoke out.  Do you have experience with this ESC?

Looks like they’ve updated to the 4.12 hardware design now.
