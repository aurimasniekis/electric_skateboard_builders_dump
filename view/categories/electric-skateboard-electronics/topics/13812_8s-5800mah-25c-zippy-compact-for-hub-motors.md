Hobbyking has a cyber monday sale where a 8s 25c Zippy compact is on sale.

Will this battery be suitable for 2x60kv hub motors with two VESC?

25 * 5.8 = 145A
Should be enough for dual hubs.

Keep in mind though they're not really 25c like they print on the label, they're more around 15-ish in the real world.
But still should be enough for most needs.
