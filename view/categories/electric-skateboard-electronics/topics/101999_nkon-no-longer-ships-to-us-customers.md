Just letting everyone know, because this has caused me some time and confusion.
Ru.nkon.nl and eu.nkon.nl no longer ship to US based customers. I kept getting an error on their shipping page when trying to buy some vtc4 cells so I emailed them. They responded with;

"Hi,

I am sorry we closed fedex route. It is to slow, to risky, to cumbersome.

Regards,
Arjan"

I then asked if there was any way to purchase cells from them and they never responded.....

Bummer, they had some really good prices.
Hopefully this saves someone some time.

When did you place your order? It seems this is a very recent decision.

Last weekend If I had known I would have bought a few hundred. We really dont have many option in oz. Alibarba my old go to option is more hit and miss (mostly miss) I have two packs of hg2 that degraded capacity after a few cycles likely fakes or B cells. I have 200 26650 but I am finding they are too thick for for down decks.

@Movation If you have an ABN, you can create a wholesale account with wholesale.techaroundyou.com 

Prices there are on par with the cheapest I can find anywhere else with the bonus that they are local.

But until NKON figures out a different shipping method, I dont think there is anyone else that sells that cheap without ordering enormous quantities.

First pack I ever built was from their ebay store hg2s capacity tested 2630 to 2880Mah likely original but old or B cells pack 10S3P packed a punch as far as current. Better than the littokala that test almost 3k Mah but heat up like little heaters if you pull more than 10 amps. I do have an abn. The cells I use for my business are mainly 38120's a 200Amp 8-10k Mah capable cell way too big for esk8. They maybe ok for samsungs would love to find a cheap reliable source of 21700's.
