Hand drawn or photoshopped, visio or cad. Who's got beautiful diagrams? 

NO BANTER! JUST PICS! (short explanation of what it is is fine). This was a great idea from another thread, so here it is.

hey just a word of advice I was doing something similar and almost burned my house down. heres what you do:
1. Wire the batteries in series FIRST
2. take your 2x 3s to 6s adapter and cut the black wire closest to the middle
3. Now you should be able to run this safely

if you plug in the lipo alarm/voltage reader and it shows 3s, switch the two connectors around.

If you do this in any other order expect to get a shit ton of sparks

This is my thread, so ignore anyone else imposing rules. 

I said no banter. Banter gives no fucks what format it arrives in. No banter on cassette tape. No banter on Laser Disc. No banter on Hi-8 or parchment or stone tablet or magneto-optical or holographic cube or quantum entangled crystalline devices or in images or motion pictures or oral tradition or smoke signals or RFC1531 or morse code or secretly passed hand written notes or apple talk or tcp/udp or netbios or windtalker or in breath on windows or secret handshakes or knowing glances or two people butt fucking. They look like they may be bantering while butt fucking. It's hard to tell because they're both looking at the camera and presenting with a lack of discernible emotion. The butt fucking is fine as long as they're quiet about it and aren't bantering within their frivolously sexual comms protocols. 

So if you like you can butt fuck here but shut up about it. And no using butt fucking as a way of encoding banter, i will know immediately. I can detect everything from encapsulated messages to cheek slap pattern encoding.
