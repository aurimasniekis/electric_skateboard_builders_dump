Haven’t tried it.  Wonder if it would reduce low speed control.

Only one way to find out mr Humbert. When you're done grinding the shit out of some esc's build one of these for science!

I don't think you get easier coasting with reduced cogging torque. The magnetic field is conservative, so at speed you shouldn't be losing any energy from this, an opposing torque as you roll will always be balanced by a assisted torque as the roll continues. The only real losses would be eddy currents in the metals of the motor, not sure if this would reduce those.
