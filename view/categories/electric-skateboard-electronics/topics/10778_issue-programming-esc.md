Hey guys, so I'm using the Torqueboards ESC programming card but when I plug it into the ESC is gets stuck on this screen.

Anyone know what's going on?

The UBEC is built into the ESC right? Wow, silly me. Just realised that you need to use the other shorter wire. The longer one is for the receiver and the shorter is for programming.

There's only one wire coming out, the other one is just a switch for the UBEC. :slight_frown:

I was getting mixed up with 12S ESC. Might be best to contact @torqueboards now.
