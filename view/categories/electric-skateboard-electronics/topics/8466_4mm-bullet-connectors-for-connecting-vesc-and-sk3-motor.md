I was wondering if these ( https://www.amazon.com/Castle-Creations-CCBUL4X3-Bullet-Connector/dp/B001ASCHU2/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1472352842&sr=8-5&keywords=4mm+bullet+connector)  female 4mm bullet connectors could be soldered onto the VESC and then accept the male 4mm connectors of the Turnigy SK3 motor. These look like a different design, so I'm not really sure! Thanks in advance for your help!

You want something like this: https://www.amazon.com/Gold-Plated-4mm-Bullet-Connectors/dp/B005D5MWQC
I would just buy the pack and then you have extras if you do something wrong or need them in the future.
