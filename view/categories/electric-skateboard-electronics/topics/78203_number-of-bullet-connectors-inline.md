Should I be concerned with the number of bullet connectors inline with the main power to the motors?

I'm trying to make my battery enclosure more modular and one way of doing this would be to use more bullet connectors/XT-90 connectors but I'm mindful of potential voltage drop in each connection.

I have an inline (obvs) anit-spark, splitting the batt power to each VESC, connection out of the enclosure, and then the bullets on the motor.

Do I need to worry/be careful? I could always solder extensions to some of the wires, such as the one that comes out of the motors(s).

You should be fine, just be sure to make proper solders and use flux
