Over the last few days, I've been learning as much as I can about making battery packs and as far as I can figure, this is what I want to do...

I want to make a 13s pack with [THIS](https://amzn.to/2YF8Q8M) BMS and 13 Sanyo NCR2070C cells.

Does that check out?

And if so, what voltage would I need to supply to charge it?

Thanks

I love this function!

In all seriousness I would alway be tempted to go with a bestech BMS because it's what I know.
You can get them singularly from litech power.

I think you misunderstood my question.  I'm not looking for a charger, I'm asking what voltage I would need to apply to charge the pack.

To be clear, I think it's 54.6v, but I wanted to get verification on that.

```
4.2V*13S=

54.6v

So you are correct. Boosted XR batteries are 13S and their chargers are labeled 54.4V just as an example.
