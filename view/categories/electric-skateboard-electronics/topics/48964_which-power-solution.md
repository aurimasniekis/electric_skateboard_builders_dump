Hey all, planning my power soultion for the first build,  need some feed back or solution. 

Should I try and find a suitable lihv battery and use an imax charger, which i have to charge to 4.2v leaving headroom for brake regen or should I spend 260 on a good charger that can control end voltage to 4.0v on a regular lipo for headroom?

Lihv batteries are bigger and cost more and harder to get but makes use of my current charger making the total soution around 100 bucks less at first.

Lipo batteries are more plentiful and offer more size and configuration combinations but i need to outlay a fair chunck for the expensive charger that can control terminal voltage.

Im leaning towards regular lipos and new charger.
