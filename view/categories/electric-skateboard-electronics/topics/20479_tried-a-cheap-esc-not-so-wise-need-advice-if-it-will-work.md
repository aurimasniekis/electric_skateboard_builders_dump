Hi

Does this ESC work for an electric longboard?
http://www.ebay.com/itm/100A-Brushless-Water-Cooling-Electric-Speed-Controller-ESC-w-5V-5A-SBEC-f-RC-Hot-/331832057284?hash=item4d42bb5dc4:g:wHoAAOSwymxVI4rC

its a 100A Brushless ESC with 5V/5A SBEC
BEC model: Switch

Settings
User programming options:
Cell Type: NiMH/NiCD/Lipoly/Li-ion
Cell Count: 2S-7S/6-20NIMH
Throttle Setting: Auto/Soft/Hard
Brake: No Brake/Soft/Medium/Hard
Direction: Clockwise/Counter Clockwise
Cut off: Soft/Hard
Timing: 1o/7o/15o/30o
PWM: 8Khz/16khz

My first problem is I can´t program it using my thumb wheel remote (winning - without the winning text :P).
I belive the ESC needs a regular classic remote with two knobs to program it.
The engine will run but it seems somewhat random/inresponsive to the controller.
Also it starts at about 80% full power when the control is in neutral .. unsure if any setting will fix that.

What to do, buy a classic remote to program ESC?
Or buy another ESC, which one? Setup is 6S li-ion and a Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5055-280kv motor.

Buy car esc. These boat esc's brakes are so bad that basicly there isn't any.

that's nice , which motors are you using ? single or dual ? and i'm searching for dual motor esc's , they're quite expensive in most of the big e commerce . Can you recommend websites with good quality products with reasonable pricing ?

Yeah the 150A version is very good.
Also the 120A version will be good.
