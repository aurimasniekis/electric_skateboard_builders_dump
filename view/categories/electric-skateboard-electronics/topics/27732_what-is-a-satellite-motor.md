I'm sorry for such a noob question but I saw the post from @onloop about hubs vs belt vs satellite motors but I had no idea what a satellite motor is. Could someone please explain?

satellite refers to having reduction in the form of belts and pulleys in this case.

Oh so it's just like a belt and pulley setup?

Actually, Satellite simply means the motor is offset on a seperate axis from the axis of the wheel, doesnt necessarily mean there is gears or reduction, just means away from the drive wheel axis.

For example, you can still have a 1:1 gearing ratio with a satellite motor configuration.
