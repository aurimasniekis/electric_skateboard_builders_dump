That's it right there.People keep trying the same thing hoping for a different result. That's the definition of crazy by the way. I burnt mine out in the first 4 miles. Sent in for warranty exchange but got smart and ordered a 12s esc for a back up to keep me running. That way I won't be down when I wait for repairs lol. Now thats a Vesc thing you wouldn't understand unless you had one. Hence the shirt. It runs smooth when it runs and people like the features.
