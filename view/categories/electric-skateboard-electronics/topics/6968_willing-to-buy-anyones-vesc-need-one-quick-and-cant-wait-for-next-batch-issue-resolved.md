My VESC recently died and I really need a new one before school starts up again soon so I can't really wait for the next batch. It sucks too, since I just got the Space Cell Pro4 and can't ride now....

If anyone has one they'd be willing to sell to me, I would greatly appreciate it and will pay for shipping costs. (Preferably in the USA)

I know I'm asking a lot, but please excuse my insolence.

TorqueBoards should have thier batch in very soon now too. 
I also ordered my second VESC (for this kind of situation) last week and and the order has been filled and be to me soon (from enertion).
So you may want to try either from fottaz, TorqueBoards or Enertion mate, I'm quite sure you'd get them within a week or 3 :)

I'd love to buy one from you @chaka, but $165 is a lot for me at the moment as I'm in a bind with money.

We would like to sell them cheaper if we could but that is the honest price with quality components. Too bad you aren't local you could come by and resurrect a VESC from the boneyard.

Yeah, I understand the cost in putting these together. I hear yours are some of the best. Just wish I didn't screw myself over with my summer spending........

I emailed Dexter at DIY and he said they'd be ready in about 1-2 weeks, so I ordered from him.

Why are the power leads a thinner gauge than the motor wires, it should be the other way around :anguished:

Not sure why @fottaz is promoting EU origin parts for a (possible) USA client. It'll be more expensive because he'll have to import it to the USA. Hence your EU shop's advantage is for us in EU to get rid of the import duties.

Hi @Skitzor, of course my website is better for Eu citizens like you but also if someone will need some parts, I would ship them to him. Of course will not be the cheapest way...I've created the shop for european first, but for the rest of the world also.
