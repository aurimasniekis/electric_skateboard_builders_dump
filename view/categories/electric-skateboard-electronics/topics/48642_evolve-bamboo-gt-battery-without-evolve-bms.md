Was super lucky to get a "Free" Gt battery for my project, but one problem I'm running into would be the BMS, does anyone know a BMS I can use with it or a way to charge it without having major problems?

The genuine Evolve BMS is yeah, but im using focboxes instead of their esc so i should, in theory, be able to use any bms since i don't need to use those extra wires into the esc

I've been looking for a BMS as well, the only one that I've bought so far is [this](https://www.banggood.com/37V-42V-10S-45A-Li-ion-Battery-Protection-Board-BMS-PCB-System-p-1177351.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN). Have you had any luck finding one? 

Another one I have found that has an e-switch & a uart setup [is here](https://www.lithiumbatterypcb.com/product/14s-bluetooth-lithium-e-bike-battery-pcb-board-with-30a-constant-charge-and-discharge-current-2/) but I am not sure if it is necessary to buy.

Nice, would you mind sending me a link? I'd like to have a backup in case the one I ordered doesn't work out.

I dont really have a link sadly, just got it used of a guy here in Denmark but any BMS rated for like 40 or so amps for the correct voltage and cell count should work :-)


But its from ebay, its white and rated for 40amps 10s.

Anyone have any luck with the ? The two above linked by @Kit have the wrong discharge voltage protection.
