Hi there
i'm following this forum from a lot of time and i think that is an amazing forum....! Finally i have decided to change my movements in city.
i'm thinking about a one motor configuration with 83mm wheel, at the moment... and i'd like 20km autonomy...
ah, sorry for my bad english.....
i have read the motor/battery guides.... but i have some questions :confused: sorry!

**MOTOR:**
About the motor, i have see at hobbyking this model:
[turnigy aerodrive sk3 6374](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/catalogsearch/result/?q=6374) 
but i cannot take a decision about the power... there is 3 model, 
149kv @2250w 
168kv @2400w 
192kv @2750w
how do i understand how much power do i need?
i'm 178cm x 80kg
if you want reccomend something better... I do not want to go too fast

**BATTERY:**
About the battery, i'd like to have an autonomy like 15-20km... ( if it's more I do not complain :) )
in the "specs" section of motors indicate that is good choice 10s or 12s... 
so, this is a good choice?
[ZIPPY Compact 5000mAh 5S 25C Lipo Pack](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-compact-5000mah-5s-25c-lipo-pack.html)
there is a better solution? more thinner, etc.. Ho 

**PULLEY:**
About the pulley configuration, reading the various posts I realized that the best configuration is this:
1X 15T 12MM motor pulley
1X 36T 12MM wheel pulley
1X 12MM belt
i want to craft this (except belt obviously) and the motor mount with 3D printer... I'm thinking of using the PLA... and for the motor mount was thinking to print [the enertion mount](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3fcba37897e6e2c656b688ac/w/b9eec7243db97928e9485100/e/34d76e4279b659bd593e70a4)

thank you!

Hey you can use this calculator to fiddle around with the kv and teeth to get your desired topspeed. http://toddy616.blogspot.nl/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html?m=1  Put the efficiency on like 70%. For the rest its mostly preference although some people on the forum know a lot more.

Oh and try to find a build you like that someone else already did might be helpfull for your first diy. I did that myself aswell!

Motor:
In this case, it is not about the Power but about the kv. 
192 kv @ 10S will fit your needs.

SK3s are good motors, so you can go with them.

Battery:

The ZIPPYS are good.
to get the wanted range at 10s you will at least need 10s2p with these.
If you calculate range, you can use the estimate of 10wh/mile.

Pulley:
Check ratios at http://calc.esk8.it/ .
Printed Pulleys work, but i am not sure about PLA.
The mount will for sure not work printed with PLA.
It may with ABS, but not sure there
