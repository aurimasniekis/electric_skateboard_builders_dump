Hello esk8 community.
I want to get some answers as to what to expect in terms of range on different setups of boards. A fellow member has created a forms for everyone to enter their data. You will need you wheel diameter, gearing ratio and voltage. [Link to form](https://goo.gl/forms/GMx0XRDZD5z0YALa2)
Thanks,
Thomas

This has got me wondering... is the @Ackmaniac app already accounting for doubling the wh/mi on dual vesc configs? Am I really getting down to 7 wh/mi when going for range with low power on two vescs? I do have two vescs set up in the app, wondering if it's really 14 or 7 wh/mi.

Because on my 350 watt hour battery, 25 miles seems like a much better estimate for range than 50 miles. Then again, I can get around 10-12 miles on the settings that give me 27.5 wh/mi which is right on the mark for 350 watt hours, and I haven't really range tested my low wattage mode.

```
If setting the app to 2 vescs it doubles Wh/km (mi) to match total. I get around 4,5 Wh/km if set to 1 vesc and 8,5 if set to 2.

I would like to analyze wh/mi data better. I created a google entry form for everyone to enter their data to that we can share, use, and do statistical analysis on as a community. 

[**_Link to the data entry form_**](https://goo.gl/forms/GMx0XRDZD5z0YALa2)

[Link to data results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b8d7Qnic8egB43oqNJ-pJfjuzXCroYC_VEUJvnDegNc/edit?usp=sharing) where I will be performing analysis

You should know basic stuff like wheel diameter, how to figure out your gear ratio... etc. I have tooltip descriptions to help out if you are new and get stuck. Thanks yall!

@Trdolan03 Do you want to maybe update your original post with this link so we can gather more useful data? Thanks!

Note: I've compiled everyone's data up until this point, but if you care to, please go back and add in the missing info if you have it... I will clean up the old data as the new data comes in.

I like what you're doing.  I don't think hilly areas are included in the calculations but I know that's a big factor.  Also average riding speed.  Do you think there is a way to include that information?  Like mostly flat or mostly hills.  Then maybe a few ranges of average riding speed like 10-15, 15-20 ect.

Okay, now you can enter watt hour/mile or kilometer. Number in the same place, just have to select kilometer or miles and the sheet will calculate for you. It should all be working now to add in wh/mi or wh/km.

Tonight I am going to be doing some graphs to hopefully show some better trends, such as data outside 2 standard deviations from a series being filtered out. This will be on a separate sheet, so none of the other charts or data will be affected. 

Since we don't have too much data right now, a single person with huge wheels vs a bunch of others with 90-100mm wheels draws the moving average or trendline way out... i'd like to be able to look at a graph that filters out *some* of the oddball results for me. Even though (trying not to be bias with any of this data) I may seem to agree with the way a trendline is going, I know it doesn't 100% make sense.

I really am the odd one out lol. The lightest person with the biggest wheels. I thought there were more mountainboard users. You might as well remove my lonely pneumatic result, keep it for solid wheels. 

My max current seems to have been edited too and is now incorrect, max current is actually set to 60a on each vesc.

Fixed! Thanks for that correction. Secondly, let's keep the value... You should be able to enter anywhere up to 999mm into the form, to account for pneumatic wheels. I can filter when making charts if necessary. :-P

Oh shit, now I understand! I've been looking to that table like crazy. Trying to figure out why I'm using so little.

The wheel diameter is in mm and the weight is in Kg, so I had no reason to think that the distance would be in mile instead of km. 

Could @skatardude10 change my (tehatheist) value from 7.5 to 12 please? That makes it correct for miles instead of km.

Nice graph. Although my wh/km shows as wh/mi :smile: 
But yea, yesterday i reseted a trip in ackmaniac's app and after 20km trip with about 30km/h on an no wind, flat land, i got 14wh/km.
Woah, 22wh/mi. Compared to all others, that's bad. Must be because of the only weak point in my build, the no name chinese hub motors.

@Quezacotl, On the form responses sheet, you have 14wh/km. Check the calculations sheet (far right tab), and scroll all the way to the right. It translates your 14wh/km to 22.5wh/mi, and shows up as that on the graph. It looks good to me, but if this isn't correct, let me know. 22.5 ain't bad. 

For some reason your motor type isn't querying into the calculations sheet though, which factors into the motor type averages. I'll look into that. _**Edit:**_ I figured out, apparently the query function doesn't handle mixed data types well, so i've changed the form to entering 0 for hub motors and 1 for anything else. Now the data for hub motors should average out into the motor type averages graph just fine. I've changed your entry to 0 for hub motors. 

I'm also going to be going back into my vesc logs and averaging out my own results... I am going based off memory atm and I wan't it to be as accurate as possible. **_Edit:_** Done!

Reviving this post after more than a year with an analysis of the data that are present to this date in the excel file. I cleaned the data a bit, removing the points that were far off. Now a clear trend is visible. You can use the equation to calculate an estimated km/cell by putting your weight (in kg) in place of the “x”. However here I am assuming that Samsung 30q cells are used. If other cells are used, just divide by 3000 mAh and multiply by the mAh of your cells.
