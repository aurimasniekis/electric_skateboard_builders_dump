Did you Mesure them... or your’re just trying to find a 3mm difference over a picture. And BTW the profile of these wheel is completely different one is flat and the other one is rounded, so it could be 110mm on the middle of the wheel. I don’t say you’re wrong... but we should mesure them with the proper tool before any conclusion

Edit: Who knows maybe the Evolve wheel is bigger than expected.

get a caliper and measure the center of the rough stuff wheel? Maybe that's where the 110mm is

My buddy has the rough stuff wheels they looks so nice in red but they honestly ride like crap in comparison to the Abec 11. If they made 107 clones I'd pick that over the rough stuff wheels they are and feel way too hard.

![20180110_161452|690x388](upload://ggyOL4vFIGIQnnNFhrvsyLbKn2g.jpg)

As seen on the pics they are 110mm wide at the center.

ahhhaaa! mystery solved.

This reminds me of those thin laptops that always advertised the thinness in measurements and ignore the thick part of the taper.

I have them in red and they look amazing, however I know they are going to vibrate like mad and ride like shit.  I wonder if you shaved the centre would ot be better?
