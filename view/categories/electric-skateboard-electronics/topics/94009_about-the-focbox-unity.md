I waited 2 months for mine. They are made in preorder batches. If you want a new one sooner, you would most likely be paying more than retail price to buy an extra one somebody bought.

The flipsky dual vesc 6 is very good, i prefer it to be honest. Ive been using it in 12s foc for a long time and its been flawless

the newest versions made back in oct 2018 are fantastic. mine has been very reliable, i  have used the singles and the dual. if you are building a regular street board a unity is fine if you can manage the cutouts (12s foc). if you plan on using massive motors on a full size off road board, the dual 6.6 is my go to choice for sure. the price is unbeatable and any issue i have ever had has been resolved by flipsky.
