Hi guys

So for my build im waiting on the enertion single big boy kit and VESC to arrive

meantime im shopping for betteries, charger and remote

i couldent fine the GT2B remote on hobbyking anymore but i've found this one

http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__92511__Rocksta_4WS_Transmitter_w_Two_In_One_Waterproof_Receiver_and_ESC_UK_Warehouse_.html

1. you guys reckon it'll do the job as safe as the gt2b? plus, will the receiver plug safely to the vesc or i need a voltage transformer from 32/42v to 5v ?

2. i'm considering two battery options : 2 s6 lipo 5000mah or 2 5s 5000mah. both in series. i wanted to consult on weather should add to the series (that goes to vesc by enertion) a fuse (40-60A) or the vesc would be safe either way

I don't know about this one, but I think hobbyking's gt2b are clones of those flysky gt2b: http://www.aliexpress.com/af/gt2b.html?ltype=wholesale&d=y&origin=n&isViewCP=y&spm=2114.30010308.0.55.cQNebg&site=glo&groupsort=1&SortType=total_tranpro_desc&g=y&SearchText=gt2b&isAffiliate=y&initiative_id=AS_20160608043349&shipCountry=il&filterCat=200002649

Does this ''winning'' remote support any kind of cruise control?

I don't think so. The one I bought from tourqueboard looks the same and they said no cruise
