the thumb throttle is very wiggly and crooked and its partly coming out a little. Is there a fix for this?

I'm having the same with one of my nano-x's. I'll probably open it up and see why there is so much play. It sometimes moves so far out of "socket' that it doesn't work properly. Kinda scary when going 35mph. I'll update here in 10 minutes or so to see what I find.

exactly what happened to me. I was going pretty fast and all of the sudden the remote just braked and I almost fell off, but luckily it didn't brake so hard.
please let me know what you find and if there is a way to fix it.

I actually bought it brand new from @scepterr, so he probable has the order number. I do have the box though. I can take a video though

I put a small drop of superglue in the hole of the trigger where the pot goes

the problem is sometimes it even get jammed to the side and its hard to push forward or backwards and it could also get stuck in one position.

I just opened one of my couple nano-x's that have the same kind of slop you're talking about @dg798. Nothing looked screwed up. I just had to tighten down the 3 screws for this one to feel a shitload better. No more slop. I would try that out and see if it works for you.

Going 35mph is more than kinda scary.

There are 3 screws on the outside of the remote. I know it seems too easy, but I was getting so much left and right play with the trigger that it would go too far forward and backward and get stuck. None of the casing looked loose at all. The two I've circled are the ones that will tighten the area around the pot and could benefit from being tightened.

Also. Just thought of this. Might try it out this weekend when I get some more sun. Could probably put some hot glue or super glue in the two spots I've marked here (and the opposite side of the case if needed) to ensure the throttle range is stopped where it's supposed to stop. 

Also. Don't do any of this if your remote is covered by warranty. They will replace it. I have a bunch of these and this one is out of warranty. ;)

I remove the thumb trigger off the pot, put a small drop of glue in the hole and put it back on

You can also use silicone, I've done this mod for @i2oadsweepei2, maybe he could give us some feedback ?

My nano x works great. The throttle has been fine for me before and after the mod. I have another nano x on the way so I'd love to do any suggested mod myself. High 5 dudes!

Put glue in this hole but dont push it in too far, just enough to the little knob on the end can glide over the arch, giving you the circular motion.

I also took this time to cut off the mirroring button. I dont need it personally.

I also glued the throttle module to these three ridges, there was a little bit of play. Make sure its not on the center or you will lock your throttle up.

Here you can see how it looks after

I also glued the USB port for added support, and I glued all solder connections that I saw.

Additionally, you can coat this remotes electronics with conformal coating or corrosion x to water proof. I dont ride my r2 in the rain or snow so I am not going to do that. 
End result: no slop, super sturdy and I dont have to worry about my throttle reversing when i'm holding on to my controller and the ridiculous speed of the r2.

HAPPY MODDING!

So here is what my remote does.  I verified it is charging with the light off. But it still doesn't come on so well.  Purchased new right before Christmas 2017.

I suppose, it's puffy when I squeeze it. I've only had it on the charger once for like ten minutes.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/7/279d4c720fc863dceeca5603a2fdd6e729b39cf1.jpg" width="375" height="500">

It's definitely puffy, check that neg lead to the PCB, might be hanging on by a hair, had that on one remote and lead to puffy lipo

Both wires are super thin from the factory. Appears to be connected fine.

So I checked with my multimeter. Charged battery to 4.19-4.20v then unplugged it sits at 4.09. I figured it would sit a little higher than 4.09

It might just disconnect if you pull a bit on it
