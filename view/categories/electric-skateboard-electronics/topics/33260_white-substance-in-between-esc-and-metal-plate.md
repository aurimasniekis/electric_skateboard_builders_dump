Hey guys, I took apart my board to fix it because the ESC burnt out. When I separated the ESC and the metal plate, there was some white paste in between, still wet. 

I'm guessing its thermal paste but I just wanted to get confirmation. [Here are some pics of it.](https://imgur.com/a/JN9CS)


I have some spare thermal paste from my building my PC. [Would something like this be okay to replace it?](https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16835856010)

Shit I put way too much paste and its gushing out the sides. And I can't wipe it off since I already closed it and all the screws are stripped lol. Would it harm the electronics? The paste is supposed to be non-conductive.

It should be fine. Thermal paste is made to not cause trouble. I would still watch it for awhile and look for anything ad normal. But I would say you are all good.
