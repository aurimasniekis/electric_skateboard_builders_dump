Hey, I am going to get the Carvon VESC because of the the confidence of it being programmed for you when you purchase a carvon hub motor. I'm planning to get @rpasichnyk awesome VESC monitoring system, but on his website it asks what model the VESC is, to see whether it is 6 or 7 pin. So, because it isn't specified, what is the VESC model from carvon?

Carvon uses HW version 4.12, So you are looking for a 7-Pin Connector.
