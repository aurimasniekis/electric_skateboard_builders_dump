i'm seeing a lot of people say different things..

basically for short term ( 1 day of riding 40~ miles ) i wanna use my board without the current erpm cut outs.

could i temporarily raise erpm from 60k to 80k? I'm running 12s on 200kv motors so it passes 60k atm

thx,

**Could I raise focbox erpm to 80k**
Yes

**safely?**
No

That's the sort answer.  The long answer is...  Its unlikely that 80k would cause you an issue but its metric shit ton more likely than the 60k ERPM barrier.  Remember, even though the FocBox hardware is beefy as hell and takes a lot of punishment, its still a VESC 4 platform.

Did you go for the 12s setup with the 200kv motors?
im at the exact point where i want to upgrade from 10s to 12s without changing the motors.
So i want to ask if youre uing 12s now and if its holding up?
Would be great to hear your opinion.

I use 200kv motors on 12s with focboxes and it has been fine for me.

Been tested to 100k erpm without blowing up but that's a single test.
