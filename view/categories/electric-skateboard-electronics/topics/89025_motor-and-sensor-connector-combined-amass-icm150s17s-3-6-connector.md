they look a bit dinky for bigger boards but it might do for small hubs

They do, the problem is I have no idea of the dimensions and nowhere to buy

The AS150 in the name may refer that the bullets are the same size of a common 150 bullet, way overkill

Nice find! I would be down for a group buy. I have searched a lot for something like this.

Found some more pics [here](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=http://www.china-amass.com/mobile.php%3Fr%3Dproduct%252Findex&prev=search)

I send them a message asking about specifications and MOQ for a bunch of similar connectors. Let's see if they get back.

@Pedrodemio, I edited the title of the post, hope you don't mind and feel free to please change it back if it's not suitable.

Thanks, that's way better

This one you've found fits best, I didn't realize it also had the 6 low current pins

EDIT: is it the same just the male version? I'm confused

EDIT2: apparently there is a version that is derived of the XT30 and another from the XT60

EDIT3: Wrong, they are all based on XT30, that may be a problem with the currents we use
