Hey guys,

I am looking into making a new board for my brother. Haven't decided on decks and wheels etc yet but starting with the electronics:

Thinking to make a 6s2p or would 3p be better? He wanted it to be as light as possible... Are those cells good?

https://eu.nkon.nl/samsung-18650-inr18650-25r.html

Would a 60a bms like this one be sufficient?

http://www.batterysupports.com/22v-24v-6s-60a-6x-36v-lithium-ion-lipo-battery-bms-pcm-pcb-p-478.html

Thinking to go with a 245kv motor like this one

What are your thoughts on this setup?

I have this motor with a 6s2p battery and am very happy. Depending on your gearing of choice, you can either get better startup torque or higher topspeed. I get up to 35kmh with 15t / 36t and 76mm wheels.

Would you say that the batteries I chose are good for 6s2p? They can discharge at 20A so that'd give me 40A but the motor is 70A ... ?

Hey @Namasaki why do you think a 6s2p Li-ion isn't good for esk8ing?

I would suggest maybe a 3p just for some head room. Is it flat where you live? if so 2p should be ok. If you go with the 2p I would suggest a 40/45amp bms that way it will cut the load if you draw too much current and it won't ruin the cells.

He lives in Hamburg so pretty much flat all along. But i don't want it to have a big voltage sag etc .. so might go with 3p i guess. What BMS do you suggest for 6s3p?

What do you mean "cut the load"? If i draw more than the bms can handle- won't it just fry my bms?

Most will cut the load I think or maybe they do just fry I'm not sure. I got the impression that they would stop the current from flowing and blowing up other things. With the 3p it will be rated at 60amps from your batts so the first bms you were going to get will be good

Are you planning on using a VESC? If so go with a lower kV motor and a 10S2P. It's only 2 cells more than a 6S3P and you'd have significantly more power. Plus your VESC would stay cooler.

Also you probably won't need a motor that big for the kind of power you're looking for. A 6354 would be fine if you wanted to save some weight.

Also most people reccomend Samsung 30Qs over 25Rs since they preform better despite their rating.

Would it voltage sag more or less than a 6s3p?

Low voltage like 6s is gonna mean higher current pulled from the battery. 
And to only have a 2p is going to compound the problem.

Fair enough ... What would you say is a good setup for a lightweight, low speed but occasional burst? He just needs to get from A to B on mostly flat ground and i don't want it to sag or anything like that. quality is a must

so now i am completely wondering what is the best?

10s2p
8s2p
6s3p

?? :D

I think for it to stay light i'd have to stay under ~20 cells? This is my first diy pack so i am not sure

Ok now i am thinking 6s3p like @GrecoMan suggested, as its gonna give me less sag and my bro doesn't need crazy much power anyways. 

Would this 220kv motor from alien systems work well with 6s3p? I'd prefer to buy the motor from a skate shop rather than hobbyking's sk3s ... Also this one is 5055 so i can save some weight and $

It is amazing and I run it on 6s2p, ships from hobbypartz I think

245kv at 6s is great, itâ€™s a perfect balance of torque and speed

I recommend the sk3â€™s over the 5055 from APS

Those are the ones.

1000W / 37V (10S) = 27A
27A / 2 (2P) = 13.5A per cell

1000W / 22.2V (6S) = 45A
45A / 3 (3P) = 15A per cell

With a 10S2P you'd be drawing less amps per cell for the same amount of power as a 6S3P and have less voltage sag. There would also be less stress on your VESC due to lower amperage.

I have a 10s4p build with those cells: https://eu.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/lg-18650he2-imr-battery.html
But i have now ordered a spotwelder to make a new 10s4p pack with the same cells. I don't know in what time you want to build you're board. But when making my own pack go good. I want to make also packs for the esk8 community. 

PS: I am from Belgium

In your calculations, do the 1000W mean we are assuming this single drive build brings out a 1000W?

I just chose 1000W as an arbitrary value. The ratio stands for any amount of power though.

Since 2 30Qs in parallel could put out 40A, I'd set your VESC to output 30A just to leave some headroom to keep the cells healthy. That should give you a little more than 1000W which a 6355 would be able to handle fine. Look for a motor around 190kV.

ok so i think i am gonna go for a 10s2p as this gives me more power and less voltage sag than any of the other options, while having about the same amount of cells. furthermore i have been reading that voltage sag can influence range so significantly that 10s2p should still outperform a 6s3p in terms of range, even though it would have more mAh. 

That said, i have questions about building a 10s2p:

I understand how to wire up balance leads in a 1p battery like here

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/1/317517c3d5852785d44d06136b1126fa04535bf5.jpg" width="666" height="500">

but how do i go about that in a 2p? Do i join the balance leads on the packs in parallel as well before they go into the bms etc ?

You simply add the cells to those single rows however if you don't u derstamd how to add parallel cells I wouldn't advise to go out and build a battery, have someone do it for you or read some more

## \#43 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2017-09-30T04:48:15.431Z Reads: 60

You connect the 20 batteries into parallel and then you will have 10x 2p packs once that is done you connect the 2p packs into series to give 10s2p. The balance leads go onto all of the series connections I believe

haha thanks for the input guys :) i understand how to wire cells in series or parallel, no problem. what i dont understand is 

1. in a 1p obviously each cell can be measured individually through the balance leads. but in a 2, 3 ... 550p :D how does that work? i join two cells in parallel an just have them use the balance leads together?

2. if i wanna make a really flat pack, so lets say 10 x 2 next to each other (not stacked on top), how do i go about seperating them, so they dont short on the poles when the two rows are lying â€žnext to each otherâ€œ? just a bunch of isolating tape? 

hope you understand what i am asking here hahah :) cheers guys

1. Yes the two cells just use the one balance lead

2. You can use whatever you like eg. cardboard, tape, rubber or foam. Anything that is nonconductive

Maybe some battery builders can let you know what they use

Hey so i was thinking ... a 7S3P would still be better than a 10S2P?

1000W / 25.9V (7S) = 38.61A
38.61A / 3 (3P) = 12.87A per cell

Is this thinking correct? The 10S BMS on alien systems is sold out for a while, thats why i am looking into other options. Are there reasons why a 10s2p would still be preferred over a 7s3p? The cell count only differs by 1 cell ...
