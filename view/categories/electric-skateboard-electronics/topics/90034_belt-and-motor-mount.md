Hi I was just wondering if this motor, belt, pulley kit, is a good option for a dual motor board. 
Or should I get something else, any other options?

Hit up @Boardnamics for affordable caliber ll mounts.
Those mounts suck.  Don't buy them.

Good idea. My favorite good and very cheap drive kit is @Boardnamics mounts and this complete pulley set
