Hi All, long time since I've been here, but I stumbled upon this on ebay. What are your thoughts and has anybody bought one?

Do not buy these. The connection is super unreliable and has caused quite a few disconnections and even injuries.

Search it up on the forum. We usually call it the nano remote

I've bought that exact controller and though I haven't had any bigger incidents with it, I just don't feel safe riding with it from everything I've read about it.
There has been one or two what I think has been disconnects with it but as I said, they haven't resulted in any injuries.
All in all, I would say that this remote isn't worth the price, neither in money or in possible health issues.
I've ordered a GT2B which I've 3D-print a nicer enclosure for instead.

Thats right. You gotta use the force. Only reliable way to get from point A to point B. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‚

I would just buy the new remote from Enertion, it cost 37.62 pounds (+ shipping) and think it should be pretty good.

i don't recommend it, sometimes it feels like you lose the control of the board :(

There is also the benchwheel remote which is on offer on Aliexpress at the moment. Strangely I ordered and didn't pay immediately and it went down to Â£32 inc delivery overnight  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Electric-skateboard-refitting-parts-remote-control-bench-technology/32731985084.html?spm=2114.01010208.3.10.IAeWrr&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_3_10065_10068_10084_10083_10080_10082_10081_10060_10061_10062_10056_10055_10054_10059_10099_10078_10079_426_10073_10103_10102_10096_10052_10050_10051-10052,searchweb201603_6&btsid=9e89f31e-449a-47b3-b207-3f93314239a4

Lol, yeah I know but I have done some configuring to it to my liking! So now I have a big range with it with no problem! I recreated the pcb inside it, with lipo charger, etc. But its arduino compatible so I can make it do anything! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/1/c1f261d9c349b8f738bbfc19cf5f1add14d8cd29.png" width="500" height="154">

And I think I will make a casing(maybe remold the controller). So I can sell these reliable controller to you guys for just 20-30 dollar. As long as I change the case so I don't get in any troubles :3

But if you use circuit maker to combine one of these:

And do the calculations (I came up with these myself (they are good I know))

Sugar + Jetpack = Fly

Ok, thanks for the info guys. I fired up my Ali Express App and bought a single channel trigger style controller Â£32 (with good reveiws) and slow delivery. I already got the Wiimote working with a Wiiceiver, but I'm still not happy with short stubby thumb control. Skateboard is off road the time being as the weather is too wet here in the Uk. BTW although Ali Express shows free delivery, they have different prices for the same piece of kit with different delivery options.

Here is the one I got, it gets a 5 start rating. It looks the same as the one that some others are buying on this forum:-
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2-4Ghz-mini-remote-controller-with-receiver-for-electric-skateboard-longboard-free-shipping-by-post/32573238408.html
Also with faster shipping here:-
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2-4Ghz-mini-remote-controller-with-receiver-for-electric-skateboard-longboard/32607181070.html
I went for the cheaper slower post option as this tends to slip through the import duty net easier than DHL from the little experience I have had but you never know.
