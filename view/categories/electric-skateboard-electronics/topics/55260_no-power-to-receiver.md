When I plug in my nano x receiver to my vesc it doesnâ€™t get a red light at all. Any ideas?

Take a voltmeter and check the voltage between the middle(red) and the black wires that goes to the receiver.

Then you should at least see a flashing light.
Probably something with the receiver.
Been having issues with the nano-x receiver as well.

Did you try plugging it the opposite way? did you try plugging it to the 2nd channel?

Then i'd say it's the a faulty receiver.
Do you have a different remote receiver laying around?

Issue is with the receiver I guess, 
Can you please email at support@enertionboards.com with all the images and your order ID (if you have one?)

Well that does it.
@CarlCollins should take care of that if it's still under warranty.
