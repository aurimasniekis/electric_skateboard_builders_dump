Im really tired of having a short 8 mile range. I would love to see more like 12 miles. I am also very interested in having a more economical charging system than carrying around a IMAX B6. I would love to find a good price on a used battery if that's an advisable option. I'm also open to buying a welded battery pack  and doing the wire soldering myself.

You could just buy a bunch of 18650 cells and make your own pack. Or commission @barajabali to make you a pack if he still does that kind of thing.

I would love to make my own pack but unfortunately I do not have anywhere to use a spot welder.

I made a 10s4p pack with a soldering iron. See here:

Well then, that is very interesting!! Do you know the cost for the materials as well as BMS and charger?

I am completely uneducated on how a 10s4p would even start to be assembled. I'm up for the challenge though!

Well, Ill just go for it then. Im going to rename this thread as to a noob building a pack and document the entire build for others that may be in the same boat that I am.

Goal: Build a 10s4p Battery Pack

Problem: I have absolutely no clue what I am doing and welcome any words of advice (or warning)! I am competent with handling electricity and basic knowledge of wiring. I can solder as well so that shouldn't be an issue. I mainly need help with sourcing and knowledge of what to buy and from who. I am not being lazy and depending on you for every answer as I will be doing extensive research and reading on assembly!

This is how I put mine together. 

Not saying it's the best, it's just how I did it. And I didn't use a BMS, put a balancing port and charging port on the enclosure.

Is this a legit site?? If so that would mean $3.80 per cell

Yeah it is, I was able to get 52 for the 3.80; they shipped from Texas and came in about a week. They do require them to be signed for when delivered which can be a hassle.

Im in an apartment complex so the office will receive them for me!

So apparently I have found the cells at a good price. Now to find the other materials and to purchase it all.

For science and comfort I will be building a Lipo pack instead. I will be building a setup like what @Namasaki has done.

I just got back from a test ride with my rebuilt battery. 9 miles with hills and still at 3.75V resting.
its a 10s lipo 5.2ah 10c/20c split in 2 x 5s flat packs. only like 8mm thick. but I stack 2 high. 

multistar pack works decent for this since they are just wrapped and taped together. but its kind of a pain to split the tabs. 

you could save some time with [these](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-1s-20c-lipoly-single-cell.html), sadly the 40c version is out of stock...

I ordered (x5)Flightmax 2s1p, 5ah, 30C batteries along with a BMS and charger today. Will be assembling the pack as soon as it all arrives.
