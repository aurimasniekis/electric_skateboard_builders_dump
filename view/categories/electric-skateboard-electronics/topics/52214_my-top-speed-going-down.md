nothing you can do. As battery goes down, so does voltage. Lower voltage = lower speed
But for sag, upgrade to 30Q

Speed is based off rpm per volt.  Less battery volts less rpm

Iâ€™m like 60A max -60 
Battery max 60a 
And min 15
For each motor 

My speed slow down slowly like 100% battery top speed 39mph 
50% battery 36mph I think 
And 20% 31mph

KV of motors, I just think Its a mountain board and those suckers like juice lots so that's why people go with lipos instead and yes they may get more range but the volage sag is not there I think not a mountain board exspert here

Try changing motor settings to 80/-80. That ought to do it. If motor and battery settings are equal, you'll feel the speed die with the battery, I believe. 
@Deckoz ..?

I was in foc sensorless mode I've tried sensord really smooth and quiet, but I run foc sensorless mode I can launch but foc is like smooth throttle curve so not really crazy but bldc will launch u like a fricken rocket from what I tried I hit 30 way to fast in bldc trying to test how fast does it launch.

Why did you mount such a big battery if you are only going to use it at 60A, that's 30A for each ESC assuming you have Samsung 30Qs or 25Rs. 

I run a 12s4p and push it everyday at 80A, it's also a Trampa board, I have a sweet spot weight wise, plenty of range, I mean I need to ride the board a lot to deplete the battery completely.

Haha Regulars changing their profile pics is mighty annoying. You get so used to just identifying people by their pic...

The 30Qs can do 20A completely safely, so really you should be at 140 total battery max across all VESCs. Motor min/max should be the absolute ratings from the manufacturer.

That sounds exactly right as I'm designing my board to have top speed of 62kmh/39mph fully charged and at 45kmh/28mph at cut off voltage with 12S battery.
