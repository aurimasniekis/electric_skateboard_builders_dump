![image|214x499](upload://ycW9qQLRp87hW1NeoM8JHD4tDvu.jpeg) is this wiring set up correct? Also I want to replace the stupid black connection. Will bullet connectors be ok? And I’m new to electronic building do all my wire sizes need to be the same? I have a couple different size wires and want everything to be ok when I go to connect it all. Thanks and appreciate any help.

I cant really see all the wiring, or which part you are worried about. Posting diagram would be helpfull for you and us so we can understand whats going on more clearly. Which black connection? Wire sizes dont need to be the same, depending on their location. In the parts you pull more current you want bigger wires. (The biggest ones are from batteries). I dont see the reason to get more wire sizes, its generally cheaper to buy few meters of red and black, and just use that. Depending on electronics, and current you will be supplying, you can calculate wire AWG. 10AWG is around 50amps, continuously which should be more than enough.

Just to be clear, if you plug that together right now it's going to short and burn.

Hard to tell what is going on from the photo... are you running positive and negative through your loop key?

As @brenternet if you plug it in right now there´s gonna be a big firework/fire.

Don’t do like that !!!!!!!
Please post a picture how that part you posted is integrated in your hole build.
If red is plus and black minus of your battery you just short your battery and burn down everything!
A loop key should bridge the positive or the negative wire from your battery to the esc.
Don’t use bullet connectors. Get a xt90 plug, male site and solder the wires on there.

I wasn’t thinking by running both through the loop key was late for work when taking the picture haha. Can anyone help me in the right direction from this picture and please tell me if it’s wrong?I’m so close to getting it going again and I don’t want to fry my new focbox. Thanks again ![image|375x500](upload://vuLgJ6YdZJPiuXFeHL5U9p7IYfz.jpeg)

I bookmarked this some time ago. Not my work.
Should look like this. 
Hope this helps

Thank you! This is much appreciated and can’t tell you how glad I am that you saved this. I think I will do the same by saving this and give it a try.

is the xt60 connectors doubled where the wires split to the battery and vesc?
```

Two for vesc
One for battery

Probably a dumb question but The other connector doesn’t go to anything right?

It goes to the second esc. If we're thinking of the same connector

Yeah, the second connector doesn’t go to anything. You don’t need to make the second connector, as that is for dual Vesc. Since you only have one Vesc, you only need one connector

Thanks guys that’s what I ment I hope to have it completed later tonight. What’s the correct way to turn the board on once it’s all completed? Plug the switch in first? Or turn on then plug your then plug in the xt 90 connector?

![image|374x500](upload://A69frWXHWdTjPM9ToziJHWO0dxj.jpeg) is this the correct wiring before I plug it all in?

Yes but make sure to insulate those exposed soldering points. 

You can use liquid electrical tape

Thanks it was my first time and new to soldering I will definitely do that or make another cleaner looking version. Just wanted to be absolutely sure it was done correctly minus me forgetting heat shrink. Thanks for the input and help.

Before I plug it all in do I plug the battery connections in first then the anti spark key? And is this wired correctly minus the exposed motor connections?

Im on my phone so it's hard to tell. But it looks like positive and negative are opposite between esc and battery.

Esc has red on left black on right. 
Battery and loop are red on right, black on left.

Second pair of eyes not on a phone? 
@mmaner @b264 @Sender @Battosaii ?

sorry for the bad picture but the red is on the left and the black is on the right of esc? Just had wires twisted: and in what order should I connect the rest of the wiring ?

As long as the loop key isn't plugged in it doesn't matter

The photo is blurry and one of the XT90 connectors is installed backwards, but I don't see anything wrong.

Of course I don't remember which side the + and - connect on that ESC and not sure about the power switch wires....not sure about a lot of it.

But I don't SEE any definite fire hazard.

*Always plug in the loop key last.  ***Never*** ride the board unless it's **all the way** plugged-in.

Looks right to me, do you have a multimeter?

To be sure unplug the ESC, then connect the loop key set up to the batter insert the Antispark and test voltage coming out where ESC should be pluged in, just make sure the polarity is correct

Yes I do have a multi meter I will check it thanks. Do I need a toggle switch or will the loop key act as it?

Loopkey is basically your on off switch

Any reason why my remote isn’t pairing with it when it has in the past? Only thing I can think of is the new rocker switch. The old switch I had to push to pair.
