Is there any version of a direct drive for 90mm wheels available? 

On the most dds is tue gap between motor and ground on 90mm wheels just to small. Is there any version available with smaller motor? 
I know, they would not be crazy powerful, but I really miss the round on my hub motors... :frowning:
