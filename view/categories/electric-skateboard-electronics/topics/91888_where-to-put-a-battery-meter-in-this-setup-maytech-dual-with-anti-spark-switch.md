My first board if you look through my history was a 10s5p diyeboard dual hub. Fortunately I didn't have any problems with it and it lasted a whole season of heavy riding. 

Haven't been using it much lately, but I think it's time to bring it back. This time I'm swapping the esc for a Maytech dual that has a built in antispark switch which means I don't have the usual way of wiring the battery meter with the in-line anti spark. 

Any ideas on where to wire a battery meter in so that it only comes on with the switch?

are these solder tabs switched? meaning if you connect everything with the esc off, and put a multimeter up to it, is there 0v or does it measure the same as the battery voltage no matter if the esc is on or off?

unfortunately not switched, getting 40v across either on or off
