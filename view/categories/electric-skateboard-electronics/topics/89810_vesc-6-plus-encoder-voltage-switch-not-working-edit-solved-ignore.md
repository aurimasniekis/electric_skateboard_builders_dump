I ordered a brand new VESC 6 Plus the other day, and it is driving my motor fine, but the encoder V+ is 3.3V in both switch positions. I'm also not measuring continuity between V+ and VCC, which should be the case according to the schematic.

I've contacted Trampa but so far no response.

Any ideas?

EDIT: I am currently talking with Frank about it, I spoke too soon :)

Hello chocol4te,

Wanted to know if you made any progress integrating your ABI encoder.  I too am trying to do it tho my VESC 6 + but hasn't had any luck completing the calibration process.

Thanks
