Hay I have some mepo hubs that were donated to me and the vesc doesn't detect the sensors anyone know how to get it to work? Is it wired wrong for the Chinese hubs? Also foc does not work on these hubs, has anyone got that to work? Been at it a while so any opinion would help. I'm using a vesc x

Hummm, I‚Äôve done it once without any issue. Are they using the same connector as the Focbox? 

Maybe if you can post some picture, it will easier to figure it out.

If it can help I did it buy the sensor detection wasn't always work so I ended it up use them sersorless. Anyhow here you find the motor wires order. Yuu need to combine it with the one on the VESC. Only 5v and ground matter, temperature wire is not present live it empty. The rest are the sensor wires.
