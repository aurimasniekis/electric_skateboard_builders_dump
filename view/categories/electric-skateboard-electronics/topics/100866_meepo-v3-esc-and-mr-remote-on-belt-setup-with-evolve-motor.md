After fiddling around with the Meepo V3 ESC and the Evolve motor plugs and sensor cable, I finally got it to work correctly. The 3 hall Sensor cable needs to be move around on both side of the motor for it to read correctly. Positive and Ground stays the same. It's only been a day so far that I put it to the test. Put about 5 miles on it so far and no problem yet. I will keep you guys posted on it.
