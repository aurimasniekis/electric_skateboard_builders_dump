Found these on one of my aliexpress rampages. Couldn't find them on Amass's website, but they do look like genuine Amass.

Very very nice! shorter than XT60, and only slightly wider. Depending on your build, could be much better a fit than MT60. Tension is nice and tight.

I am using MT60 on my trampa without any issues even with my -/+ 90A bat :)

Also they are pretty old on Amass website http://www.china-amass.com/ChanPinZhanShi_3.html

I know that plenty of people are using the MT60's I'm curious about the MR60's.  Thanks for the quick response.

If you want to know they are real. The pins should not melt out of place when soldering the wires/means they are made from nylon instead of some cheap plastic.

Got the MR60's in. The plastic is solid and the connectors seem high quality, as good as any other genuine amass. I'll be putting them in a build this week and I'll report if I have any issue with them.

So this link appears to be exceptionally cheap, at $1.12 per set (20 sets). My original purchase was around $2.40/set.

I like those for phase wires, it also keeps them in the same orientation so if you disconnect the motors from the ESC you don't have to go through a motor detections again.

I use MT60, they are good !

What are the connectors used for the motor sensors on this pic ? 

And what is the riser pad ? Custom or commercial one ?
