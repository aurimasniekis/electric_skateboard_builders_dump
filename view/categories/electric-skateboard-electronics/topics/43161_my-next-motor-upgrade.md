I actually used to sell these motors at my former job. You could reach out to a few places but we sold Baldor, Leeson, Weg, Toshiba, and many other weird ones

You'd need an inverter on the bottom of your board, and that would take up way to much room.

I think you will need an adapter plate but it should work no problem

I don't think a 4.10 can handle this one. You're going to need a 4.12 at least, possibly with slight modifications. 

i recommend the 60S1P 30Q pack, i can build you one. Go with a single drive and a 6 inch belt, and you'll need the cocaine.

No way a 30q pack will be able to deliver enough amps!!! You definitely need a decent lipo setup for that. Maybe zippy flymax, some 6s in series?
