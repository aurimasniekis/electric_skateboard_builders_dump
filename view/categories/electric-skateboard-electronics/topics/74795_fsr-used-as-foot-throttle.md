Hi, my name is Avos and I have built several eboards. I know some electronics but am having troubles learning the basics as in reading the diagrams. I initially had a zboard, then z2, then got sick of waiting for parts to fix them, and built my own. I am currently using a remote transmitter for throttle but would like to use a Force sensor resistor as a foot throttle. So that is my question is how does one use a 2-wire FSR as a throttle like a potentiometer?  I’ve done a bit of research and from what I understand is there needs to be a voltage out using 3v3 or adc using a resistor and maybe a op-amp? Could some1 please explain this to me in an easy to read process?                     1k              FSR
+3.3V* -------/\/\/\/------+------/\/\/\/\-------- GND
                                              I       As this work?                ADC Input
Would as simple as this work without damaging VESC?

I think there is [more information on the analog controls](http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?t=650) over on the other forum

It’s my gamertag bro chill. I made it when I was prolly in 8th grade and Halo just came out. You were killed by D1rtyNeed1es and/or my copilot DesperateJunky.

Too many good friends gone for me to appreciate the humour there my friend.  Each to their own though.
