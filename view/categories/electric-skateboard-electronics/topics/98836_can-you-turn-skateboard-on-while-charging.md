This might be a stupid question, and I don't see why you wouldn't be able to. But I have a fsesc 6.6, and a charge only bms. I have the Bluetooth on the fsesc so I can check voltage. So can I turn it on while it's charging to check? I mean I don't see why you shouldn't be able to but I want to double-check before I do
