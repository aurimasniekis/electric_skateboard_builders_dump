I have 4 of these of which I only will need 1. I canâ€™t seem to figure out if there is a specific sequence to wire it in as in all the positive leads and then the negative or the other way around.

Probably better off buying from amazon at that point due to shipping. Good luck in the World Cup

You are better off buying from amazon directly. https://www.amazon.com/DC42-45V-Battery-Protection-Li-ion-Balance/dp/B074WZL5NF/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1531250294&sr=8-1&keywords=42v+bms

I have this bms and it works well, although slightly higher balance current would be nice. 

The b- goes to your battery negative, c- is charger negative and p- is if you run through the bms but I think you said you aren't so just leave that one. The balance leads should be numbered 1-11 so they just need to be connected sequentially starting from the 1st balance lead or the one on the negative of the battery. 

Also make sure to connect B- before the balance leads or it can fry the bms

@pat.speed There are only 10 pins on the balance connector which are marked b1+-B10+. If you look at the pictures there is a small thing marked gnd on the left that doesn't have a pin. Do I need to run a negative wire to that>

Ahh ok my mistake this must have been the bms that had only 10, sorry I thought it was my other one. You don't need to run the pin to ground as it is already connected through the b- connection, just number them normally skipping the 1st pin
