You need JST PH 7 pins. Well you will use 4 pins in total so they will also work but why bother about it when you can get it for cheap anyway. I will post one link. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10-Sets-JST-2-0mm-PH-7-Pin-Female-Housing-Connector-with-Wire-and-Male-Connector/32823550472.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dPX360m
For the module depends which phone you have and which module you buy. Which phone do you have?

for iphone you don't need. For Android Oreo there is the risk. Is not that diffiucult. I found that this clone in 80% of the case works with Android too https://www.aliexpress.com/item/AT-09-BLE-Bluetooth-4-0-Uart-Transceiver-Module-CC2541-Central-Switching-compatible-HM-10/32460561807.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dZKdfqb. But better to flash it because can be that with futher updates it won't be compatible anymore. That what I do for the modules I see

If you read above I just answered. I have like 20 of them. The most recent ones work with Android Oreo. Although I can not be sure it will work in the future. In case you can flash it later

Just want to say that after flashing mine with the original HM-10 firmware, it works a lot more reliable with my iPhone on iOS 11. It used to fail to write configs using Xmatic app and took several tries to make it work.
