I'm towards the final stages of my very first build. So, to me.. My phase wires look ok. I gave them a loop to give slack for movement. I have limited experience and just working from logic. So, any feedback for this set up will be much appreciated. 

Thanks!

Those motors look hella close to each other. And you can do a little shorter phase wires too. But that looks good.

make sure you got a good/same belt tension (i.e motors will align themselves). You should also cut the motors cables to avoid this visual "loop".

Is that a torque 218 truck?

Something like this can be made to get rid of the wire loop and can be made to any length needed

but the length of phase wires is important? I thought only from battery to esc

Nope these are the V2 180 mm. I thought about getting the 218 after I went with the 6355 motors. I sent a pic to the guys at torque board and they said it should be fine.

Looks fine.

But the alignment of the mount on the right is not square, as I can see the motor can ends aren't lined up.

Also someone mentioned the motors are close...mine have 3mm between them lol his spacing is fine

I like the setup. I spent days going through that thread checking out how everyone does their wiring and I seemed to of missed that. I have a hard plastic riser and a soft plastic riser on it was from amazon. But how high should I go? I'm already at plus 8mm. I guessing another 3mm to cover the wire diameter.

Cool, are those special 90 degree plugs, or you just soldered them in an angle? 

Thanks!

These work well to hold cables to the board, looks good too:

I cut part of the wall out so you can solder a wire in at 90Â° without bending

I was going to use a mending plate and washers to make something like that. Second idea was to use a spark plug wire holder. But that is much better.!

Thanks!

This is how we have been routing them.  Our thinking is to choose the path with the least movement for strain relief. One of the leading causes of failure is too much movement of the phase wires where they enter the motor.

Hey chaka can you tell me about the vesc you sell, and do you have a website or anything?  I'm going to do a build with the Carvon V4's 4WD, and am thinking of using those 2s graphene blocks for a 12s setup.  I think I am almost ready and know everything I need for the build, but I am new to this and welcome any suggestions.

I've been to that site many times, lol, that's you?  So would I want to go with the vesc V4. 12 or the ollin v1. 1? I'm not sure what the difference is between them..?

For every motor, there needs to be a vesc.

4wd=4 vescs

I think he sells an adapter for 4wd.  I look forward to your build thread!

at this point I'm pretty much his marketing team with how often I promote his stuff lol

Lol you should make him pay you!  So would I be able to have them connected with each other so I could have a sort of traction control, AWD sort of smart drive system?

yea, if you know what canbus is, it is 4 of those soldered together so all the vescs "talk" to eachother

Lol, I originally was just going to buy an Evo 4WD, but figured for that price I could make a custom board with the V4's and make it just as good if not better, for much less, and I'm doing some rough adding up here and everything so far (not including a board, I haven't chosen one yet) and I'm at about $2700 haha.  The board I'm considering is like $900, so this could easily turn into a 4k build...  This is gonna be sweet!

Tacon is still going strong!  It'll be retired soon though since I am almost done making my 10s6p pack.  It has served me well!

Psycho actually gave me a mount and an enclosure lol.

unfortuanetly both the mount and the enclosure from @psychotiller will also be retired soon

Would this be a better - safer - reliable setup with riser pad wire organizer? It seems that's the only way I can position the motor. The blue tape is where I would put a tie down to the deck. Theres enough play for max left and max right movement. 


Thanks for all the help!

That doesn't look like there will be enough slack. Electrical tape also works as a temporary solution. I'm sure those tie downs will be back in stock.

Maybe you can swap the wires from one side to the other like me? So left motor goes to right esc

I like the thinking behind Chakas & scepys method, how ever you do it the closer you get to the hangar pivot and to a minor extent the kingpin, the less movement and subsequent strain it will have on the wires as they provide the axes for movement.
