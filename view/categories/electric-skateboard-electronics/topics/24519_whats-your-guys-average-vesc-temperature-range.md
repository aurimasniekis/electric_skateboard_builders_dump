I just added 6 new heat sinks and am curious about how much cooling they will actually do, I put them on the DRV's to hopefully keep them cooled down as it gets pretty hot here in the summer and my vesc is in an enclosure. What would be considered around the max temperature a DRV can get?

Max temp for electronic components is 90 degrees Celsius for safe running.
