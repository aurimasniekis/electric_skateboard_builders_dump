You could use normal pulley with a square hole and use bigger/wider key to secure it from moving? Hope you get what I mean :)

No, I remember having to buy an assorted pack of grub screws just for the one I needed. I'll look at the size when I get home, it's pretty small.

We just haven’t gotten to them yet. I think the steel are 20 and the aluminum reds are 10 a set. I’ll double check and get back to you. But that sounds close.

I have a set of turques as well. Really trying to get a good variety with so many different motors and shaft sizes it’s hard to just have one. I haven’t tried to put the tboard on the race star but it could work. You belt size will change. ![image|375x500](upload://bfAsWxAMTGhdZ9k9lMEocZn2Gca.jpeg)

The ones from torqueboards are not specifically made for my motor and shipping is crazy high

Give me a day to get them up on the site. I have the reds aluminum and I also have steel the same. The aluminum are 10 a set and steel are 20. I will shot you an message when they are up. I’ll also run a test shipping to Canada to see if it will cut some slack on shipping.
