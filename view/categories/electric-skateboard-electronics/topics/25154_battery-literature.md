Hi,
I am pretty new to this esk8 community. I like many other people had trouble grasping the idea of Batteries: LiPo and Li-Ion. 

After reading around a few places, and watching a few videos, I am better aware of how batteries work and what numbers mean. 
I just wanted to post a few links here that helped me understand battery terminology and concepts. Of course, I am not the best knowledgeable person in this topic, but it has educated me enough to understand the conversations people have here on the forum.

_Introduction to LiPo batteries_:
* http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/the_li_polymer_battery_substance_or_hype

_How Low can a Battery be Discharged?_
* http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/premature_voltage_cut_off

_PreCharging before assembling pack_
* http://liionbms.com/php/cell_prebalancing.php

_Charging Tutorial (EEVBlogs)_
I recommend this video because Dave explains the difference between Watt-Hour and Amp-hour
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6mKd5_-abk

_Complete Guide:_
* http://arxangelrc.blogspot.com/2013/11/chargind-discharging-and-maintaining-lipo-batteries-properly.html
* https://rogershobbycenter.com/lipoguide/

And as always if there are more links anyone else has, please let me know.

Topics to become familiar with:
-Capacity
-Voltage
-Current
-Series and Parallel
-Charging
-Discharging/Characteristic Curve
-Maintenance/Care
