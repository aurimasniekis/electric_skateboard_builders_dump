I have been following this build guide as it is my first build and I wanted a place to start. [Link to Build](https://www.instructables.com/id/My-Homemade-Electric-Skateboard/) 
I have got to the electronics diagram and wired it all up. When I did this, the esc started to smoke and broke, I think it was to do with the anti spark plug not being connected correctly, but I am unsure. He didn't release a full video or photo of his wiring diagram so am unable to see if I did anything wrong. Was wondering if any experts or any one with any knowledge could help me. Thanks :grinning:
