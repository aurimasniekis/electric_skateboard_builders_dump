Hi,

I'm about to start wiring everything together and wanted some opinions on the schematic I have.

Here is a list of the parts I have:
Series connector: [https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt60-harness-for-2-packs-in-series-1pc.html](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt60-harness-for-2-packs-in-series-1pc.html)

Parallel Connector: 2 x [https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt60-harness-for-2-packs-in-parallel-1pc-1.html](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt60-harness-for-2-packs-in-parallel-1pc-1.html)

Batteries: 4 x [https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-5000mah-5s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-5000mah-5s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html)

XT90-s

One thing I'm concerned about is that the wires making up the parallel connector are 16 AWG.

Here's the schematic I have, any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Looks okay.

16AWG parallel wires might be OK, depending on the amperage you're going to be drawing. Parallel connections will split/share total amps. I would replace them still.

Better be safe than sorry, especially if you don't want to see your board on fire.
I would use 12AWG everywhere possible.

Only 10AWG and xt90s in my board :grin:
Better safe than sorry

Learn to solder and make your own connections! Soldering is an important skill to learn, ditch premade connectors and get some wire, connectors, an iron and some heat shrink!
