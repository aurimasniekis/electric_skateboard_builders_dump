thanks ! I didn't designed this but it was made by a french member of my forum on my DIY custom carbon radio which I'm riding for several years now. I'm actually modeling an improvement that fits my freestyle requirements and that I can put in the pocket which still using GT2B components.

I printed the first version but the scale was wrong ... so it was useless.
a bit disappointed but that's DIY.
I might try again with the new version but I was waiting for someone to confirm that the scale was now correct.

Looking at the comments in thingyverse, I see that the size has been correct in june.
I have not tried to print it since then (I use 3Dhubs, I have no printer on my own ... and to throw 15euros away again makes me a bit reluctant ... ;-))

I have updated it, but didn't test it for the time being. 

If you have to use a printing service to print it, or except a perfect mod, don't print it. 
If you want to test it, and help me to improve it, print it and tell me what is going wrong.

I'm almost done with my new remote so unless you are in a big hurry that may worth waiting. It's light, ergonomics; fits in the pocket and space have been optimized.

not yet - I plan to finish it properly before any release. I have a 3D printer and ... some iterations behind and more to come if you see what I mean :) 

I may be also looking for support/donations as this was a bit consuming in PLA material !

Im a noob at this modding stuff, but I'm assuming you just unscrew your gt2b, get all the parts and place it in the new 3d printed case with no soldering required. I'm hoping its super easy to do..

I'm planning on doing this by printing it out on 3d hub, and I got some good prices in my area. I could print out 1 okp case for 7$ or get 2 complete okp cases for 10$. They only offer ABS plastic printing so not sure if that will be a problem. The next cheapest seller in my area that does PLA plastic is 15$ for 1 okp case.

[quote="TheRedPlum, post:48, topic:15524"]
with no soldering required
[/quote]

I just finished my GT2B mod, the @MasterCho mod which was super easy btw. However, there was some soldering required, this is because at least for the mod I was using, a battery modification was required. You can find a tutorial on that here https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=71922. It is basically making 2 pools of solder on the positive and negative terminals of the battery then reusing some wires from the Channel 3 PCB to the main PCB to connect the battery directly to the main circuit board. I hope I could offer some clarification.

EDIT- I am not sure about this case but by the looks of it, a USB charging port relocation will probably be necessary, this requires soldering as well.

I may just delete it if okp release his mod, to avoid any confusion.

I need to tweak it a bit more to get the binding button aligned on the top enclosure; I assume one iteration print will make it OK for a first release (will to it today). There's be still some improvements to come as I ride with it.

I plan to release it by end of this week at the latest if there's any interest.
*
This was the previous iteration, but I will remove the "OKP" branding (which was for fun) on it as I am not a celebrity ...!

Hey, it's freezing cold in Paris with a nice foggy rain. Here's the result of my OKPv2 custom 3D printable enclosure. 

I'm going now to give a a nice black matte spray can paint to finish it, get the electronics inside and then... give you a view on the scale of things... compared to other remote controllers ! That's gonna be my 2017 ride !

I have a shitload of PLA and a GT2B begging to be violated so if you need a guinea pig, just throw the files my way and I'll start printing.

Are you printing them with the hollow side down? 

I printed a Mad Munkey with hollow side up and it went just fine.

If you're ready to release the file's please let me know cause it looks allot slicker than the other ones. And would love to print it, but first I need to get my hands on some PETG, think a semi translucent one will look sick.

ps. If had some money left I would order one of your decks, they look great.

Same here, no problems with donating. Especially to keep cool mods like these going.

Think the PLA won't really block the radio signals, but just like @rwxr I think I've seen the wire come out a little on all mods. Better save than sorry I guess, and doesn't look bad.

Anyone got experience with PETG and a reliable source to buy it in Europe?

In doubt, get the jet spud 29; it's really awesome and it's cheaper. My deck based on the Jet (which in fact has been really tuned to my needs) is not that expensive, it's just handmade in France by a one man company that love skateboarding and art. Really love what he does an integrate some fibre glass in it. Unfortunately, the limited amount of deck I have produced are for customers; and I'm not riding one because I reinvest all the money in R&D.

This weekend was quite intense, I was on the ride, getting footage, finishing one other project, fixed a buddy battery where one of his cells failed in a 10S3P spot welded build, editing/posting videos.. so didn't have time to work on the GT2B enclosure. I will be posting it this week to the community so stay tuned!

[/quote]

If there's one thing you can count on people to do is use free files for free.  And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. I do it too as I'm sure you have as well.  

I'm not sure what you're hoping to expect but just so you have an idea of work to financial pay off, I have a donation link set up on all the thingiverse files.  Every series has sized from around 8-10 pullies each in 9, 12, and 15 belt width for every wheel. All in all there's about 120 pulley files. They've been up since August of last year and in since then I've received a grand total of 5 donations. And on average they are 5 bucks or less with the exception of one outlier. 

I think what's more important is that if you're presented with an opportunity to give back either financially or via your services which can aid one or more people and you have the means,  either financially or the capacity to design and development and create something that others can benefit from,  to then you should.  And you know what,  if you can't? That's fine.  Honestly knowing you're helping out is a better feeling than an extra 5 bucks in your pocket anyways.

Thanks for reminding me, I did print your pulley (12mm and will soon print the 15mm) and have not donated and said thank you.

Did donate to @unik and will buy some of his riser pads soon I think. Not 100% sure I want to Dremel my board to pieces hehe

Back on topic

Haven't had time print it yet. I got my PETG without a spool, so first printing a small spool lol.
Hope to do some test prints tomorrow to find some good settings. Did see allot of posts about PETG having trouble with bridging gaps. So guess I'll need some extra support when printing it outside up. Which I think will give me the cleanest result. And then if there is enough PETG left I'll print the Sparkle.

Am seeing quite some posts about people using eSun filament and liking it. Anyone got experience with that? I thought it was cheap Chinese filament that clogs the extruder.

petg is annoying to print with until you get your settings just right, then it prints absolutely everything without fuss and has good structural properties

i'm a little leery of printed pulleys and motor mounts though, people really should be using carbon fiber impregnated nylon for that

Yeah looks like it is. I found a company in the Netherlands that should be pretty good as well. They don't use water to cool their filament, which should help cause filament doesn't like water that much.

I printed a wheel pulley and think that should be able to survive for a while. Not going for mounts and motor pulley, they take to much of a beating.

To print carbon fiber I'll need a other nozzle, it destroys the copper ones. But nylon is a good option, think that will be super durable but also expensive.

yup, CF nylon by matterhackers is $65 for HALF a kilogram but it's freakishily tough. Super wear resistant, just as strong as regular nylon (which is strong) but is MUCH less flexible. 

i think it would be comparable strength to cut aluminum in our use case for motor mounts and pulleys

I used 0.20mm, which is the 'normal' in the Prusa version of Slic3r. Did check the generate supports on and changed the fill to be honeycomb, kinda liked that better. Set the infill to 50% as @unik mentioned on thingiverse, might be able to change that. But I think if it's too low the controller will feel too light. 

Hope this helps.

Hey I'm from the netherlands aswell :)). The remote itself GT2B is like 30 eur. Then you need to find someone to print the mod or use a 3d print service. I'd say if you haven't already gotten the GT2B this remote might be a cheaper solution plus you dont have to mod this one since it's already quite small: http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/2-4GHz-Radio-Remote-Controller-Receiver-Binding-Plug-For-Electric-Skateboard-/182401241102

Done mine. Great design :-)  - I'll pop a few quid on your Paypal account ! Will be from Roger Do******

My GT2B didn't come with a battery so I cut open a 800Mah 2s pack I had and used one of the cells. It's as tight a fit as possible!

The trigger mechanism is a perfect fit into the hole in the back case. A good splurge of hot glue and it's going nowhere. The other, visivle hot glue is just belt and braces to make sure the PCB doesn't move.

Yeah you hove to remove the pcb and solder the wires to the round thingy. However since im not a soldersoldier I asked my cousin to try and upscale only the part where the pcb on teh trigger is and make the whole thing 4 mm thicker so the battery that comes with the remote fits aswell without modifications. Will post the file if okp is okey with it and everything I changed (like a noob friendly no soldering version) and if it works. Will know in like a week when I have time to work on it.

@thylen11 Maybe they changed sth. on the dimensions of that PCB. I can't think of a way it would fit there without cutting or soldering it. I tried bending it in different angles but It won't :/ I'll have a picture of it up later.

Yes, but to be honest it's really straightforward and really basic. It's just a matter of time spent on this. You basically have to do like 8 soldering at the maximum but this take time if you want to do it correctly. But no particular rocket science skills are required here. 

On my side the most challenging part is to remove the support material from the 3D print. It's a bit challenging with the ZYYX+ actually; working with their support to find out the good settings.

For the trigger - you take note of which wire goes to which pin on the pot, then unsolder the PCB on the pot, snip the wires, and solder directly onto the pot.

If you can't solder you really shouldn't be doing this. You'll need to solder new battery wires, USB wires etc. 

I HIGHLY recommend you get a solder sucker. A few quid and super useful for this kind of thing. Makes taking bits apart easy. And neat.

Yes, It appears that the potentiometers are not a stock size. I figured out a very crude workaround [HERE](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/gt2b-spare-potentiometer/8739), if you're interested. I used 5k varistors (pots with just the wiper leg and one side leg connected) on either side to recreate the "offset" that the original potentiometer has.

At the moment I don't have the guts of the transmitter to transplant in the sparkle. For those I have to wait 5-10 days. But from a 3dprinting point of view I think the shell shoul'd be a little more consistent: I printed with a 0.4 nozzle, 2 shells and 50% infill, but in some places the printer didn't infill and all was left after the layer was 2 shells on the outside, 2 on the inside and no infill inbetween. Nevertheless it seems to be quite robust. Can't wait to get it done! Besides all that I think I am the first Italian sparkler 😂

Does it need to be _that_ exact? Obviously you only get so much throw on each side, but I want as much brake throw as possible (so I don't end up throwing myself off my board by accident). Rotating the gimbal counter-clockwise as far as it goes gives a good range, but I still need to figure out how to fit the PCB next to it.

This is an easy fix. Instead of soldering the wires to those pads, you can find another pad that they connect to, and solder to that. Using a multimeter on continuity mode can help find it, if you have one.

Also, UNIK,

Is there any reason that the bare antenna is routed outside of the case? I seems like a good way to snap it off… I put heat shrink around the copper cylinder on mine, but left enough to cover the active 1" of the antenna. This way I can stuff the whole thing under the PCB next to the battery, and have it protected.

I squished the shrink tube while was still hot to make it fit better. Also, It _is_ possible that routing the antenna so close to the other circuitry would have an interference effect, but since the antenna is transmitting and not receiving, I don't even know if that's possible.

Some of the older GT2B revisions worked fine, but for some reason the new ones (like mine) need a valid input on the steering channel to output any signal. So, I wired two resistors to simulate a potentiometer (it would appear "centered" to the GT2B since they are the same value). Yours might work without, test it and see. :)

Are they spring-loaded or on sloped races? I can imagine it would be hard to control if they're free-spinning, but maybe not.

Cool, thanks for the tip. Now I know where to look first if it doesn't work (:

Only need to do some cutting and soldering of the trigger. Then I need to get my hand on some epoxy and sugru.

Almost done, can't cut the trigger right now cause it'll piss off all the neighbours hehe. And waiting for the epoxy, hope it'll be here tomorrow. Small tip: pitch black sugru doesn't go well with a white sparkle...

Hey folks, there has been a massive download of the SPARKLE STL files on thingiverse which I'm really proud of. I would like also to thanks you all for your kind words, support and huge reconnaissance for the ones who have started to donate.

Don't hesitate to share your photos with the SPARKLE, either it's while riding and or printing.

If you see any updates that I can perform, also don't hesitate.

I'm looking in parallel on a way to produce SPARKLE remotes in ABS UV with a beautiful oil painting. I should have a prototype next week and of course, will share it with you for comments.

Happy riding !

The resistor can be any type (Preferably as small as you're comfortable working with). Just make sure they generally around the same value (E.g 10K Ω and 8K Ω should work fine) and wire them like so:

Hey folks, I'm receiving really great feedback on the remote either on forums or in real life. That's why I decided to investigate a bit further for those who don't want to print it or have trouble in reaching an appropriate "professional" quality level. This is now in milled in ABS block; professional quality; oil finish black painting (colors are possible). That's a prototype and I used all the donation (plus added (a lot) of extra money) as you can imagine this costs $$$ for 1 piece :) 

The fit is perfect as you can imagine.

My wife is gonna killed me hehe! 

EDITED remark : I'm not here to make money with this remote. The files are available if you want to print them for yourself and personal use.

I ended up damaging the usb board while soldering so I purchased a universal usb board. Could someone please help me out with identifying what the three pin-outs on the the main circuit board are? The new micro usb board has VCC, D-, D+, ID, and GND. I know I will need power and ground from the main board, but what will the third wire go to?

"ID" most likely isn't used. Also, you should try first with only the + and - rails connected. There's a good chance the charging circuitry doesn't use the others, and this way you'd save some mess inside the case.

I can ship it anywhere - whoever wants it just have to pay the shipping cost. I'm not making any money on it.

First one gets it ! Good weekend !

mmm. disconnect your motor wires and check on BLDC how you remote controller behaves by looking at the display in PPM. 

Check also that you have not switched into reverse mode (on the PCB - you have two switches, one for throttle, other for steering)

At the moment I only have a video when using the keyboard. But I'm using a GT2B as controller, so was just asking to double check if this is normal or that I missed something.

I was using a 3S lipo as well, not sure that might be something. Think I'll try my 10S setup coming weekend. And I'll try and stand on the deck to see if it makes a difference.

If it spins up to full throttle after about a 1/4 of the throttle then you are good to go. That is how it is supposed to work and will work on a  much smoother throttle curve when you are on the board.

It's way more sparkly than in the picture, can't seem to really catch it in a photograph.

Yeah, it's pretty cool stuff. It's Fillamentum PLA Vertigo Grey and I'm lucky enough to have a dealer around the corner that does sell online as well. http://www.plasticz.nl/en/fillamentum-pla-vertigo-grey-175-285-mm-750-grams.html

I'm able to print it at default settings from Slic3r Prusa edition.

Hallo


I have just build this pretty cool remote. I have one quistion touch. 

Anybody knows if the potentiometer for the throttle and for the stearing/Wheels are the same ? When i epoxy glued the potentiometer to the 3d printet enclosure, i must have used to much glue, because the throttle is not moving very nice anymore 😑

You can use the steering pot, but they are not identical. You'll get funny values like 500-800µs with 580 center. It's not unusable, but you need Ackmaniac's custom firmware that can handle independent endpoints _and_ midpoints. This isn't supported in the legacy BLCD tool.

You can also just pick up any old set of pots- as long as they spin freely enough.
(I used the greasy ones, and the resistance isn't too much of a problem.)

Thanks. I noticed that with the sparkle enclosure i have not the full physical throttle Range, as the trigger / potmeter allows. Any problems in that when setting end and midpoints Up in standard bldc tool ?

You might find that when your endpoints are correct, the digital midpoint does not match the physical midpoint of the SPARKLE. In this case, you need [This](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/extended-bldc-tool-with-watt-control-mode-ppm-cruise-control-individual-throttle-curve-and-android-app/12286) firmware.

If your lucky, you won't need to do anything. (but It's not likely)

Just finished assembling my Sparkle. Really a great mod/enclosure!

I somehow screwed up the wiring from the potentiometer though, so now pulling is brake and vice versa. 

To switch back to how it was meant to be...should I switch the outer connections from the pot. or how can I fix this? Thanks. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/d/3d4e4eb6774dcc7d1b2dd0d2aebc7a1629776c0a.jpeg" width="281" height="500">

@Sebike
 Did you resolder the wires or did you keep them as they came? if you resoldered, swapping the two outside wires should do

Soldered on an extension to the wires. I'll try swapping the outer ones then. :thumbsup:

Reminder for all the builders riders out there :

I updated to a v2.0 for better attachment of the screws with plastic inserts.

best mod for me in 2018 :joy: thx @okp
your milled version never made it to reach the necessary amount of interest I guess?
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/sparkle-v1-0-gt2b-enclosure-mod-by-okp/15524/288?u=andy87

one question I have, I just now have found this thread and where reading through.
I have seen that in previous versions there was a hole for the pairing button.
Is there a reason why you removed that? 

If you have it on hand, could you also link the inserts you use for the V2?
i ordered some, but the walls are too thick and because of that they don´t fit into the printed holes.

ah and....

Merry Christmas!!!

Thanks!

The pairing hole is still here but way smaller. To me, pairing has to be done once, probably twice if you want to pair with another receiver. Just unscrewing 3 bolts makes more sense to me than having a pairing hole. When I designed this remote, I wanted everything to be minimalist fitting to my riding style.

I could do that on demand. I printed one for this rider and he did the mod.

anyone could help me in sourcing the cable with the connector that goes from the PCB to the trigger? this would save some time

I’m not sure if this screw comes from the original gt2b (i strongly believe so)
But anyway it’s way too short and doesn’t fit all the way through the holes In the 3D printed enclosure. Should I get longer screws from hardware store or am I doing something wrong here?
