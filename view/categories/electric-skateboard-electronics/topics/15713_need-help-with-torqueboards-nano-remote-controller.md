Hi there,

I have recieved all my parts for building an electric skateboard and put everything together. But when i tried to make ik work the controller doesn't work. I have tried almost everything. I watched the videos from torqueboardds how to setup the vesc and controller. I don't know what i am doing wrong. Could someone please help me?
