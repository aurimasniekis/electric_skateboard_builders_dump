Couldnâ€™t find any topics on specific instructions on this so iâ€™ll start a new one.

For the time being, I will be using this cheap bms from the eBay packs that I used to make my battery.

Just solder your neg coming from the battery to B- , the neg of your charger input to C- and leave P- alone.

Then just run your heavy guage wires directly from the positive and negative of your battery pack to your XT60/XT90 discharge plug which goes to your anti spark switch or directly to your VESC. ;)

Edit: Oh and the pos from your charge cables directly to the main pos output of your battery.

Check the diagrams post as there are several diagrams there that show how to do this as well.

got it figured out. Thanks! I meant: when the bms was used for discharge and charge the charging port was spliced from the main discharge leads meaning I could use the discharge xt60 for charge if I wanted

Yes.  I have 3x 3s  and a 1s 7000mah lipo that I connect together to make a 10s lipo 7000mah.  Right now I take all the lipo out and balance charge them individually.
I want to buy a cheap bms and bypass the discharge.    I am on the fence about this.
