Looks like I need to step up to the plate and get my design out. If only I can solve why the MCU does not power up with my design.

Lol, that is one pretty big problem as it won’t run at all without the mcu haha. Although I guess the fix shouldn’t be too hard once you find it

I wanted to get the unity but I'm not sure if I'm prepared to wait til after February. I was willing to use single focboxes if i could get them by the end of the year. I've been eyeing the flipsky esc's lately. Can anyone vouch for their reliability?
