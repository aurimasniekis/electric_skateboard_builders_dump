Been thinking about grabbing one myself.

Is the kweld better than malectrics? does it warrant the extra 70-80 euros?

Both makes good welds. Are you building only one or two packs. Go with malectrics and save some â‚¬

The Arduino from malectrics didn't worked for me. I've bought and use a lot the sunkko and it's great... 
You are way quicker and the welds are better with it IMO

Ive seen a few guys set up the cable/tips to a stationary mount so you're not holding them by hand.
Im gonna bookmark that. 
Time to talk the wife into letting me build a battery myself.

@Skunk I have a boss level spot welder that's just sitting here. I got it for free cause a FET was fried, so I had it repaired by Aulakiria. But I'm not gonna end up using it for a while, I can lend it to you. If you want.

Yes. I have one as well. I use a 3s battery and love it.
Compact and store it away it doesn't take up precious bench space when not in use.
