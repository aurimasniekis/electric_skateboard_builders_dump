Hi! I got two turnigy motors: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/dt6376-14p-sensored-motor-125kv.html, dual Vesc setup, and the M1 battery: https://www.inboardtechnology.com/products/powershift-battery

What should be the right amps settings?

Max motor amps: 45
Max battery amps: 10
Max battery discharge: 10

I've:

Wheels: 90mm
Gears: 36T/16T
Battery: 43.2 nominal, 49.2 peak
Capacity: 97Wh 2.25Ah

Is that right?

Thanks!!!

Did you already have that battery on hand? Or did you just buy it?

I’ve it here, and I want to make sure I don’t ruin its lifespan
