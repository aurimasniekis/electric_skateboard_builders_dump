Hi, can someone help me with the wiring of this bms? I pulled it out of an old replaced raptor 2 etray that had the anti spark burn out and would like to salvage this part. ![image|375x500](upload://5I4j7g70Cu9IhoTlJdjZ5tCcqM3.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://p93htyTJhRPqQ7fuSO3nj3LYelD.jpeg)where does the 3 wires go, and can I use this for an 8s system by just leaving the last 2 pins unplugged? Thanks
