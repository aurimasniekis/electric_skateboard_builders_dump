I've been looking around on the form for an answer (I thought this would be a common question) but I can't seem to find any specific answer. so would a 6600mAh 6S 10C lipo be enough

Battery:https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-high-capacity-6s-6600mah-multi-rotor-lipo-pack.html?wrh_pdp=1
Motor: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-5055-280kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html (Might change to a lower KV)

I will only be buying 1 battery

It will have a maximum output of 66 amps. The motor can maximum pull 60 amps, so you're good. But most people will recommend getting a battery (or 2) with a higher output, as the voltage sag will be alot!

Theoreticaly yes, but I would recommend you to get higher discharge battery to be safe and to prolong your battery life :) 6.6Ah* 10C = 66A of discharge, motor needs just 60A...15C or 20C will be better :) 

Also I have read somewhere on this forum that these multi-rotor lipos doesnt last long when you use them on an esk8 due to the high capacity-low discahrge combination...But I am not sure about that...
