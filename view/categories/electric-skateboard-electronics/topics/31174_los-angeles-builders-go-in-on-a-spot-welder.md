@yummyblobs
@Titoxd10001
@saul

would anyone in the LA area be interested in going in on a spot welder?  the sunkko 788h can be had for like $150 now.

i would just get it outright but it would be sitting around unused about 99% of the time.

we could work out details on who, when, how.

I think that's essentially the same mine, but $20 more

Im no expert on using it but I use the 8 pulse setting and set current to the max of 8 as well.

What voltage do you use? I'm about to start using mine, but I've never spot welded before

I don't think the voltage on my unit is adjustable. It only has variable current, # of pulses and welding pressure.

I got a tip for anyone using these spot welders. If using on 120volts, go easy on how fast you tack those welds to the cells. These have been known to have either a blown circuit board trace. or blow triac.

Glad to see forum members willing to share their spot welders. Will definitely take someone up on that offer when the time comes

I used one these 60a welders to weld .12mm strips. 
I set it on max current and 8 pulses
I tried to use the extension electrodes but the length of the cables reduced the output too much so I ended up having to ditch them and just use the arm mounted electrodes.
Tip: inspect and clean electrode tips often.
I used a very fine file to clean mine.

That's been my experience as well. I aim a fan into  the vents to clear heat when I'm welding and that helps. Overall, though, I've had to go slowly with my 788. You can't weld a whole 10s4p all in one sitting. I'd say I do about 30 welds and then let it cool down for 5-10 minutes.

You mean blow something in the welder itself?

Yes, the parts that control the flow of current in the welder. The issue seems to be more prevalent in the 120V models and not the 240V models

I think what tree nutter said is correct. Like 5 to 10 minutes to cool down.

Hi @willpark16 I had a 709a time ago. I hope I can help you.

0.10 adjust 1-2 and 3-4 for pen
0.12 adjust 2-3 and 4-5 for pen
0.15 adjust 3-4 and 3-4+4p for pen
0.20 adjust 3-4+4p and 7-8+4p6p for pen
0.25 adjust 5-6+4p can't use the pen
0.30 adjust 7-8+4p can't use the pen

Those are the settings for that machine. 
Regards

were these settings for 110v or 220v?  I only ask because i had to double your settings on my 709A on 110v.

sunkko basically.  not the most robust machine but for smaller scales it works.

most are using the 788 or 709

My experience with arduino spot welders has been flawless so far.

Also I had a sunkko 709a some time ago and I was very happy with it but I need smaller solutions so I prefer arduino.
