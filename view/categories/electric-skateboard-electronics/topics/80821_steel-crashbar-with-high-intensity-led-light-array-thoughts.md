Planning to midnight backroad cruises during the summer, working on a steel crash bar with raised 4x 1klm LED lights in a 120 degree arc wired into the battery.  How useful have you found lights and what mods have you done with them?  Most lights for skateboards seem low to the ground so is this something you would be interested in buying (just gauging interest if its worth putting on the market)?

* Yes, this sounds interesting
* No, it's a waste of resources
