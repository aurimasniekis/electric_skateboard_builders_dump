Hey guys, how hard would it be to contract a 3rd party company to build VESC's? the information is publicly available im sure some factory owning fat cat wouldnt mind building them on an assembly line. 

This is a concept what do you guys think? i mean how hard could it possibly be?   Again this is not for profit, im sure the prices will be around the $100 mark per esc but this way supply wont be as radical as it always has been.  Is this the next step for VESC's?

I have a couple companys i know of in china that may be able to point me in the right direction

Id be intrested in this, as it seems like they are always on backorder everywhere. With a lage enough order i think this could work too.

Exactly. I don't have figures or anything yet but I think people would have to buy a couple each.

This is still a concept.  I have yet to get any figures from company's yet im just gauging interest.  Im assuming we'd need at a good amount.  at least a hundred or more

@barajabali I like this concept! Here's a ready-to-go alternative to contracting with a new factory: Since we know @onloop is now producing VESC in larger volumnes,  why not start with a group-buy from Enertion that gets everyone the discount price? If we rallied 100 buyers, we could get a bulk discount and get them for $70 each. I seriously doubt we could pull off a one-time custom order for that price. Also, we'd be supporting @onloop who has already put the time in to prepare a good relationship with a factory in the US and to do the initial QC for us. Not to mention, we have @onloop to thank for the forum platform! 

I personally use an Enertion VESC and it has been rock-solid.

[Here's the pricing currently available on VESC through Enertion][1]:

That's a good idea. Kind of a loophole to his ordering process though... Not sure if he'll ship to each person. Maybe we can have one person receive the entire order and have them ship it individually and charge for shipping costs

Also you have to remember that this concept to not to save money but to eliminate the gaps in ordering. So buying they enertion kind of defeats that purpose because we'll have to wait still.

This platform was created by onloop but that does not mean we cannot buy others products. The vesc is not owned by enertion.

[/quote]

-that is a good question, I figured we'd have to have them shipped to one person and then that person would distribute them to buyers. @onloop could weigh in on on this

[/quote]

-yes,we'll still have to wait, but how is that different from waiting for a factory that you contract with directly? No matter where you order from there will be a gap during manufacturing; I was thinking that the delay might be shorter if we used a known entity that has made the VESC for a few runs already.

[/quote] 

Yes, of course, I did not mean to imply otherwise. I think that most DIYers order from a wide range of suppliers and small companies. That is part of what makes it a great experience! It just seemed to me, in this case, that ordering from @onloop would be the most cost-effective way to get a good quality VESC in a group-buy.

I'm all in for community projects, but honestly by the time we get enough people in on the deal, finish production, and get a VESC in everyone's hands it will be so far down the line that you might as well have just bought from Enertion, Torqueboards, Chaka, Esk8.de or many of the others...

I mean the list goes on and on, and more players in the game means lower overall price and better availability.

So we have some nay sayers and we have some believers.  All of the company's youve listed above @cmatson  have started out the same way. By contacting suppliers and getting the ball rolling.  Im not saying that youll have a VESC at your front door tomorrow but maybe in a few months if you need one, you can just order it and itll come in a few days rather than months between orders.  

@treenutter  If stocks of VESC's were kept on hand then future waiting times are eliminated.   Also this is no for profit meaning cheaper prices for all. 
 Onloop maybe the best way to go for a one time order, but what about next month? or in 6 months? were not going to be able to scrape up 100 VESC's everytime.  If he can sell them for $70 each at 100 pcs then they must be cheaper than that (marginally) to create and sell.

All good points @barajabali. I think there is some confusion caused by what we are calling your idea... when I think of a "group buy" effort, I think of a group of people pooling their collective interest in a product to negotiate a better price through a bulk order, just like we did recently with our [18650 group buy that @JLabs and @delta_19 set up.][1]  

It sounds like you are thinking of setting up a company that will manage a multi-order contract with manufacturers; but done in a not-for-profit manner. Sort of like an eskate cooperative (or a co-op as my grocery store is called).

So ya, if you want to start something new like that, I think it sounds cool! But it sounds like it is greater in scope and purpose than a "group buy," which could be awesome!

You can find the BOM in the master.zip 

Get ready for some shockingly high prices. Vedder spec's the VESC with premium components. You will need to use garbage components to get down to $60 per VESC.

Ive contacted alot of these 3rd party company from us, china, netherlands up to indonesia. The cheapest with decent build you can get is from china - indonesia.

Since I am from Indonesia by origins and my uncle own a large company manufacturing diesel generator, I could found and use their conncetions to manufacture esc.

VESC manufacturing is expensive in terms components, the lowest I could get with minimum effort and price as I remembered is around 70 - 80 usd for about 100 orders exc caps, heat shrink and cable. I could even ask firmware installation for free. When there are more price goes lower each time with modifications that can be applied ie adding plastic or metal cover around vesc. When constant manufacturing is at hand, can have special assembly lines that can produce up to 3000 vesc in a day.

What is nice is that price for fixing broken vesc is only abou 10-30usd each exc shipping. The best part about paying this is that you get brand new Vesc instead of repair the broken piece and send you back the item.

I could get more specific numbers ofc, but I stopped there as I dont have the time yet to further process this. However if some people are interested, I could get some note.

The crazy part that I could push further is that I could even do some improvement on VESC through some engineers in my uncle factory and or the vesc assembly line if things get serious.

Yes thank you for that I need some positivity here. 

I've been told that if the caps were put onto the board instead of being hand soldered on the ores then it would save a significant amount of money per esc. That would require a slight redesign.
Please get some figures from whole ever you can I'll compare with my numbers.

Great idea, A LOT OF WORK.. Not to mention money output.. I am totally in to buy 2 or 4.. But how would you sell 100? For no profit.. You would have to put all of the money upfront.. and then hope you sell them all to make no money.. An if u decide u want to make money for all of your work, you will need to pay Vedder.. (Not sure what his policy is for his designs).. Like I said I would buy some.. But selling 100 and what if you get them and there is a defect?? All of your money is gone... Good luck and let me know if this goes through.. I am interested to see what the future holds..

I say you should go for it, only then you will understand how complex, costly, annoying, painful & risky it is.. yolo

Just remember one tiny mistake and your entire order can be worthless.... its only money though! maybe $7 or $8K worth of parts & labor down the drain, so if you are willing to loose that it's a risk worth taking.

I am onto about my 5 or 6th batch now & 4th supplier & 3rd country of manufacture.... every single order/supplier has had some issue that takes hours-&-hours & many-many $$$ to resolve...

If the supplier says it will take 4 weeks to produce it actually means 8-10 weeks, assuming there are no shortages on components, which there always is. Add another 4 weeks if you want samples first. Each sample will probably cost $300 Each

Also, after delivery of your VESC product, you will now be responsible (24/7) for ensuring every single person's 'experimental' DIY electric skateboard works perfectly & if you can't fix it people will start defaming you and dishing shit on you & probably demanding a full refund.

Other VESC suppliers will instantly hate you and start claiming that you are incompetent & your vesc is rubbish. Other fanboy forums members will also jump on the shaming bandwagon and start publicly announcing to the world that your product is rubbish too, mostly cause they can't work out how to use it themselves. Even though there's nothing actually wrong with the product.

You will write many articles & make countless videos to help people but it won't matter.. you are the supplier and everything is your fault. Even if the customer clearly shorts it out themselves!

Before all this happens a large portion of your customers will also probably get pissed off waiting and put in credit card chargebacks or PayPal disputes to pull their investment just before you need to pay your supplier.

If you are really unlucky they will wait until they get the product in hand then put in a PayPal dispute, this way they get the product & get their money back too! I call it fraud but Paypal always favors the buyer.

Once you get through the 20 or 30 emails each day asking for a firm delivery date, you will have time to sit back and realise you did this all for free! in fact you may have lost some coin along the way.

**so yeah go for it!**

meanwhile @chaka & I will sit back and count our massive fortune from selling VESC.... NOT!

Obviously there has to be a change in vesc production. Unless you are all fine waiting between batches.  Production needs to go larger. 

And of course vedder gets his share for designing it (that was addressed earlier)

Trust me when I say that I hate waiting too....  None of the VESC suppliers are trying to be out of stock...

do you have any idea how hard it is to run a business when you are constantly out of stock?.... I have been trying for 12 months to keep the VESC in stock, slowly increasing order size..... even when ordering batches of 250 didn't resolve the problem. Now 1000 should, but maybe not.

I have electronics kits that I want to sell but can't because I can't even supply the individual vesc orders!

demand has outstripped supply constantly...

I am working hard to resolve it.... trust me.

Anyway... i suggest you give it a go.... yolo


Eventually i may stop selling it as a stand-alone part...


IMO the vesc needs to be a part of a well designed & complete propulsion system... it's not great as a separate product... too easy to fuck it up with wrong motors, wrong settings, wrong battery etc..

In a complete kit it will be nearly bullet proof. It's moving away from DIY a bit but reliability is king!

One way or another theres alot of things I have to agree with what @onloop said about vesc manufacturing. To begin with VESC is not a cheap products by its self (low volume), according to the supplier I contacted supplying is not a big issue. Again I never did test order, so supplier can always say shit. Then theres version issues that needs to be dealt with (what happen when vedder suddenly release version 5).

The chances of error is big, the profit margin are fairly small in conjunction to it. If you see the rc industry, they are retailing double to almost tripple price compared to wholesale cost. So I could understand the struggle @chaka and @onloop are dealing with. Getting away from producing vesc is not an option as it helps drive their business of selling esk8 parts, in which leads us to dead brick when we have to create our own quality esk8.

Every business has risk, all business man job is to deal with it. Its not easy, but not impossible. When the time is right (getting new website and start selling to cover vesc manufacture cost), I will try to get my hands dirty.

So you guys mention people who have done it and done a few runs. Of course, if you do a group buy hopefully the person who does ship out has done all this leg work and is responsible if it doesn't turn out proper.

I think people fail to mention that Onloop, Chaka and myself take this "failure" upon ourselves to clean up if need be.

One person is in-charge of all this extra effort work for the community. That's testing, working with the vendors and shipping out, answering emails, re-shipping an item if the fault is due to the post office.

Sure, the person in-charge of the group buy is on the line but nowhere near as crucial as Enertion, Chaka, myself and any other vendors.

So in actuality, what are you really saving $20-30 for what could be 30 minutes to 2 hours of someone else's time? It won't last long.

Vedder did offer it at cost in the beginning but he stopped. For the exact same reason, it's a ton of work. He has modifications which are better for his time than shipping out and answering shipping emails on the VESC.

What you guys are forgetting is a non-profit company isn't necessarily a non-profit company. Sure, at the end of the year they claim no profit but the company does grow. The employees themselves are not working for free. Everyone has bills to pay. Time is always money even in a non-profit. The CEO's do earn $200-350k/year and well over.

In the end, how many VESC's will you need within the year? Will you actually be saving?

You guys in the end aren't really saving much if you do the calculations and time added. The VESC is actually priced as a benefit to everyone. We aren't really making a killing if even. It's to better the community and promote the hobby.

My first batch of VESC's sold out before they were ordered. Which was still unexpected considering Chaka and Onloop are already selling.

Onloop is purchasing a huge batch and the next batch of my own will be even bigger than my first.

Not sure if you guys are also aware... Benjamin Vedder has been working on VESC 5.0 which will be a 2 piece board for better modular configurations, etc. This new VESC will be more expensive but it will be better in the long run.

You can try going USA manufactured as well but half of the USA manufactured companies have businesses in Taiwan, China, etc. So USA manufactured isn't always in the USA. Go figure..

Give it 1-3 months and you'll have more then enough VESC's in stock than you'll know what to do with...

Growing pains.. growing pains.

Wish you guys all the luck though if someone does decide to venture out on the project.

I just recently added 10awg wires, XT90 connectors to my entire setups + VESC... It's amazing how much a small change can add to pricing.

Well the nice part about manufacturing own vesc from my perspective is not about price, but more into availability. What I mean by availability is that I always have vesc around, be able to repair them and when problems occur I do not need to wait. Either it's waiting time for contacting seller, explaining the problem, waiting for next batch, delayed shipment and stopped by customs asking for extra VAT.

However after I did my numbers with the pros and cons, I have to agree with @treenutter it's better to arrange bulk order from the current vesc supplier for now especially if you are within the same region.
