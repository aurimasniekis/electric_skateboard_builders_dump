Hi, 

 The button on my Space cell pro 3 broke as it sticks out from the bottom of the board as was very exposed to damage. I ordered a new button on ebay, this one:

However, I've tried all wiring combinations on the back of the switch and the switch function is not working. If I wire it with one combination the BMS powers up but pressing the switch wont power it down. 
Is this the right switch to choose? if so what techniques can I try to make the switch function properly, if not, can anyone recommend a good switch?

Do you own a multimeter? Are there any markings near the terminals (NO, NC, COM, 12) ?

I replaced my encloser and switch. I mounted my new switch on the side so it wouldn't get hit. You could do the same on the space cell enclosure. I got a rectangular rocker switch.

I ordered this one http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/172273183538
I'm guessing it the number of pins that determines if it works with the space cell, hopefully this one works.
