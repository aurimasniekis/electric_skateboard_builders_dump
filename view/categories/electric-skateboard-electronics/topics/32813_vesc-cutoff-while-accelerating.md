Hi,

It's not my first vesc so I don't know what I'm doing wrong but while accelerating the vesc cutsoff.
Gear:
6s 5000mah lipo 25c, 245kv motor.
Vesc settings:
BLDC
Motor max: 85a
Motor min: -60a
Battery max: 30a
Maximum input voltage: 57v
Minimum input voltage: 8v
Cutoff voltage is very low just for the try.

I tried to change every possible settings I could think of but it acts the same, it even cutsoff while braking hard.

I looked for errors in the terminal but there are non.

Help please.

Ishay

not an expert but motor max and min looks to high for sure

That depends on his motor ratings... Unusual to get a single motor rated above 60A though...

If its sk3 245kv than 70a is max. rated for that motor.

60a mot min is ok. It can be even more like mot max.

 I have some modes were max is 70a, min is -70a

Also max 50a min -70a. But im using @Ackmaniac tool and firmware. So there is no problem to set min  even higher than max.

Actually HK SK3 6374 is rated at 80A so my mistake...

Well mine is the Bigfoot 160 and it is rated as 75a.
Any idea what I should change to make it work?
Maybe a faulty DRV or MOSFET?

@scepterr Seems hot when I touch the hit sink.
Another thing I've noticed is soon as I squeeze the throttle all the way the vesc stops and there's a weird sound from the motor.
If I don't push it all the way I can go up the hill.
Tried to recalibrate the rc, didn't work. Tried to replace the motor, didn't work.
It seems something with the remote or with the current peak. 
It does not matter what is the battery max it keeps on happening.

If you donâ€™t see the VESc throwing a fault in the logs then it could be your battery.  If your trying to pull more amps than the battery can supply (or BMS is configured to allow) than the BMS could be temporarily cutting out (by design).  What battery/bms do you have (whatâ€™s the max discharge ?)

## \#17 Posted by: jmasta Posted at: 2017-09-10T21:48:11.776Z Reads: 155

```
You can program a higher Motor Max than for what your motor is rated.  The 'true' amperage is defined by Battery Max


@Ishayc What are your battery cuttoff start/end values?

@Esk8HubsUS @jmasta I don't use bms and this battery is working fine on a different board with the same setup but the vesc. 
I put the start and end cutoff to 10v and 8v just to make sure it's not any battery sag issue.  

@i2oadsweepei2 nope, totally different. The motor is not braking and the noise is different.

## \#20 Posted by: Nix Posted at: 2017-09-10T23:33:18.298Z Reads: 146

So when you set the 40 amp battery max the vesc can only take 50a continuous, but then when you set the motor max it's based on the max amps of the motor not the max based on home many amps continuous the vesc can take? Right? (Sorry trying to learn)

## \#21 Posted by: Scoo_B_SK8 Posted at: 2017-09-11T03:36:59.186Z Reads: 139

would the "25C" rating on battery have anything to do with it when trying to grab 70A?
try and lower motor max & bat max all the way down to something like 30A and see if get same result.

@Nix You are correct.
@Scoo_B_SK8 the 25c along with the capacity gives you how many amps you can draw from it. In my case it will be 25*5 so 125a.

while technically that is 100% correct
manufacturers are a little generous with their _C_ ratings
having some headroom is always a good idea

Are you using the Android app to log data while riding?  Your cutouts during acceleration may be a DRV8302 fault.  My VESC did something similar. It works fine otherwise, but sometimes cuts out on hard accelerations. Then resets a few seconds later and continues working...

Did you see any drv faults in the terminal?

No I can't recreate it on the bench.  It seems that in many cases a DRV error is fatal.  However mine just resets and keeps going.  As some people in my thread commented, I believe the DRV chip is failing

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/frequent-drv8302-faults-help-me-troubleshoot-with-telemetry/28332

Sounds like yours is doing the same thing. I recommend buying a BT module to be sure. Who manufactured your VESC?

It seems like I'm having the exact same issue. Hard acceleration or reasonable acceleration on a slight incline and it cuts out but just resets and comes back a couple of seconds later. Sometimes on braking too.

Where would one get one of these bluetooth modules please?

I have a usb extension socket on the side of my enclosure, it is possible to plug in my phone via usb while riding to record the data?

Don't turn off your vesc after the ride, connect it to pc and search for the faults/errors in the terminal
Tab. 
I had no faults so it makes it even harder to identify the problem.

## \#30 Posted by: jujet Posted at: 2017-09-11T10:30:09.321Z Reads: 117

This happens to me as well. 

If I accelerate really fast, I get a weird noise from my motor and the control loses connections for a few seconds, just to reconnect again. 

It doesn't happen if I don't accelerate suddenly.

That's no good because it's actually re-booting, so all errors get cleared.

I think mine may have been a result of buggy firmware provided by the manufacturer.  Had the current ramp step bug, and I was unknowingly running a value maxed out at 50, instead of the default 0.04

Im using this one - and it has iPhone app but you have to pay for module - approx Â£27/$34 delivered to UK - that's him much I paid. Plug and play :) 

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/configuration-and-telemetry-for-vesc-ios-android/13483/447 

If you have android @Ackmaniac has a free app- and you can get one of clone Bluetooth modules to go with it. 


Btw - what step down converter are you using to have USB out?

Thanks for the info mate. I'm on android so where would I get a clone module for ack's software please? (I could search but I'm just being lazy! :/ )

I don't have usb power out, I just have a short extension lead from my VESC to the edge of the enclosure, so I can plug in the VESC without taking the enclosure off.

I am thinking about adding USB charging capabilities. If I did I'd use this module...

He has linked the module in his post, from AliExpress. Order it now to have it before xmass haha ;)

I wouldn't get any other module as compatibility is a big issue, a lot of guys have problems getting them to work - unless you'll find exactly same model on eBay uk .... might be hard, pictures are usually stolen from listing to listing and module itself might not look like pictured one.

Thanks for the link with step down module!

I found even cheaper one on AliExpress 

Look what I found on AliExpress
http://s.aliexpress.com/nIB3YFJR

Or this one - quicker shipping from eBay 

https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/222244391709 

I'll just have to get micro USB to female USB 2 extension or solder female USB onto it ;) Winter project :D 

Edit :slight_smile:

Found one with female USB already soldered on from Ireland ;) double the price at Â£4 but easier. Not sure how well USB 2 will hold to the enclosure...

https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/322543582068 


Wait... I don't have any space left in enclosure :disappointed:

I'm sure you could get those modules cheaper, I wasn't sure how many cells you had in series so I looked for one that would cover all scenarios. I'll be getting one for 8s which you can find a bit cheaper :thumbsup:

 Haha! No space! :( That's going to be my problem soon too!!

Not sure if it's relevant to the problem everyone here is having but I've had drop offs that happen because of power coming from the VESC for the receiver would dip when the voltage is getting relatively low on my battery (when it gets down from 42V fully charged to around 38V).  With mine I have a custom receiver and adding a capacitor to the ground/vin on the custom recevier and on its radio (since they are separate pcbs in my case) gets rid of the drop outs entirely.  I would take advice of others here to reproduce the problem then check for faults but assuming nothing comes through there would look at either adding capacitors to the power input on the receiver so it can deal with small dips in power from the VESC voltage regulator or try repositioning the receiver to see if it has any effect (further from the VESC).  Might be red herrings but some things to try if you're out of ideas.
