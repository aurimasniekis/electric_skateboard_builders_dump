Hello!
I'm wrapping up work on my first electric skateboard and have some questions around connecting a VESC and charger simultaneously.  I've built a 12S 3P battery pack /w a BMS and plan to add dual connections to the battery.  One of the sets of wires goes to the VESC (I plan to add a XT 90 power switch where I short the pins on an XT 90 connector so I can turn power on and off to the VESC) and another set that goes to a charging port.

Questions:
- Is it ok to connect a charger + VESC simultaniously?
- Is this typically what other people do?
- Any recommendations on this setup?
```
