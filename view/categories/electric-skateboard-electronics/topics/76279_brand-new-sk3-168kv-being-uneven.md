Hey guys,

I have just bought two 168kV motors for an upcoming build and had one explode its circlip on me on first spin on 6S.

![47|690x388](upload://f9UUHhOkg5BfJVVzI8sTlHJz0Xh.jpeg) ![56|690x388](upload://cObomOJLjGZncUR8So0w7ilv6k9.jpeg) 

One major thing I have noticed is that one of the brass bushings/slip rings is WAY thicker on one of the motors.

![13|690x388](upload://bDLgOVfNGjkiCM7y2HUuAOxqvGh.jpeg) 

Are they from different batches or it's just a QA fail?

The shaft gap and the gap between bell and stator are identical, I measured.

Will HK give me a replacement set, I have submitted a claim.

Mainly just want opinions if the motors could be "different versions".

Probably don’t need the c clip anyway.

HK will definitely replace that man.  They have the best customer warranty out there.  Submit the claim and they will replace it.  The only shit thing is that you usually have to send the old one back but sometimes if its a common issue they are aware of then they just send out the new.  Depends entirely on the type of fault.  Its a good system tbh as it gives them feedback on qa issues.

I would just replace the C clip. Those motors are extremely robust and well designed. C clip was prob not installed correctly or dislodged in shipping possibly.

One of the bushings is way thicker. If I inserted identical circlip it would explode another time from friction. The other motors' circlip rotates freely around the axle.

I mean, it holds the can to the stator..

It doesnt hold anything but the brass bushing in place.

Interesting. I havent ever seen that and I used to sell a whole lot of these. Could be shipping damage or QC

I tend to say QC, because I cannot imagine shipping damage thickening a brass ring. :slight_smile:

Without the circlip my 6364 would have a play on the can, meaning it could move a little back and forth shaft-wise.

It was noisy and vibrating after the circlip exploded, so I guess that could be the case..

The clip sits in a groove on the shaft n the brass washer lines it up I think. It’s a spacer. I don’t think u need either if the magnets and stator magnetically line up like they should. U might want it anyway as u bought it but I’d just get the little clip n be done n ride

I mean, the only reason for the noisy spinning I could think of is the missing circlip allowing vibrations..

Have u tried the brass spacer n clip on the other motor?  Maybe they use different size brass spacers.  I’ve had variations in size and quantity w them

I am not being a dick to them. Seems like a Quality Control fail anyways and changing a circlip is not that hard.

Not yet, getting close to midnight so I might leave the noisy tricks for tomorrow, but I will definitely try it.

[quote="Hummie, post:14, topic:76279"]

I mean, the underlying thin ring is identical, the circlip is identical. I felt that on one motor the circlip felt so stiff I couldn't move it by a finger.

Do you think it's a slight shaft bend that causes the slight vibrations or just the absence of the circlip+bushing?

Go on.. :smiley:

If you have a spare motor with the sane size shaft, just use the ring off it. For the most part, all of them, as long as its the same size shaft, should be the same size

I personally don’t use cerclips on either of my motors, mainly just to make it easier to pull back apart. They bot run perfectly normal

I don't, sadly, so I am better off just getting some from HobbyKing..

Just checked my sk3 and they have different size washers on there.  Can only be a quality thing to allow for manufacturing tolerances.  I would be replacing the circlip and running it.  Not sure I'd run without it though if theres play on the shaft.  If a bearing goes in there it can potentially cause a short and damage the controller.  Never had it happen on a sk3 but it did occur on a loose shaft sk8 and they are identical inside apart from a sensor array.  Back bearing imploded and that was that.  Hk replaced vesc and motor.  This was after 3 months too.  As I said good back up.

Try a car shop or something.  Its just an 8mm clip.  Should be able to source it locally.

Even after I stripped this all down they still replaced it.  I sent it in a box in bits and they still sent me a new one.  Awesome service.

The can gap is a little bigger without the circlip but oh well

Range loss???

Loose chains Vs tight belts.

How are belts getting better mileage?

Chains are lower friction, get better range (only slightly) and better coasting all due to lower frictional losses. Most people don't use them due to their noise and because they are messy due to having to keep them lubricated. I personally only use them and love them but I wax mine so no mess and I don't mind the extra noise. They are super reliable.

Sorry about my uninformed blurt there. Did some research and can confirm that chains have some pros and cons, as do belts, and gears, and hubs.. :smiley:

Still offtopic but when I did research I realized that slack belts with some idlers to increase the teeth in mesh count is pretty much the same as chains. I still love the chain look more and they seem to be cheaper to setup than pulleys and belts. Sadly, gotta stay with Harley Davidson. :laughing:

What type of wheel do you use? I bought a chain kit, but had hard time making it match my wheel! I'm using flywheel (ABEC style) Had to drill through the sprocket and use two bearings as spacers between the sprocket and the wheel, but the whole thing kept coming loose. Any suggestion?
