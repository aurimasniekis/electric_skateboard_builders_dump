Does anyone know of an inexpensive 22v battery management board that has enough amp capacity to run an e-board? I plan to use 18650 cells.

Hey, I have a 22v bms from a Hilti drill battery. Hilti is just about the highest quality power tool maker in the biz. The bms is fully encased in a hardened silicone, has a temp shutoff, and has a battery indicator built in, it's also pretty new. I could include the top half of the battery case as well so you could just buy a 22v Hilti charger to charge it.(see pics for how the two fit together) *Does not come with cells* <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/7/97e0261a6786e222a1e684dc900acc594233d472.jpg" width="375" height="500">
