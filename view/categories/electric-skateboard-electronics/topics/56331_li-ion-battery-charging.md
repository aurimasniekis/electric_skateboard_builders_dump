Also charging overnight is not the best thing for your batteries.
People say leaving batteries at 4.2v for long is not good.

What a disaster! I hope the assurance people pay up. Considering the damage it's good that the whole house didn't go up in flames.

@Kug3lis & @Blitz. I read somewhere that the optimal max charge for li-ion cells is 3.94v, anything above that will decrease the cell's lifespan. And keeping a charge of 4.2v for a long time is especially bad, so better to plan your charges to end right before you go for a ride. Is that what you meant?.

The idea is that if you don't fully charge you loose capacity so if you want to have like 1.5Ah cell instead of yours 2.5Ah then yeah sure do that ;) Everyone in industry charges to batteries full capacity and has no problems, just some old ladies talks that back in the days sugar was cheaper style tips ;)

my understanding was That batteries start with a lower IR and by time go up and I've associated Higher IR with aged Lipo-packs (drooped capacity worse performance etc)

https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2889967-How-long-can-I-keep-my-LiPos-charged-a-scientific-approach

> So, after 100 (or more) cycles the battery only has 70-80% usable capacity left, and can be considered defective (100% damage). Reduced "usable capacity" means that either the actual capacity, the ability to store a specific amount of charge, is reduced, or that the internal resistance has risen to a point where the voltage drop is so severe that the capacity cannot be used at the usual discharge currents which were possible when new.

@Kug3lis I really appreciate you taking your time here and helping us out I would of even Liked your comment to show support but "village old ladies" you went to far :sweat_smile:

Where is it in your posted thread it says you get higher IR then you keep battery at 4.2V? It just discusses about battery IR changing over time because of cycles not because of keeping voltage at 4.2V.

Regarding `village old ladies` its 100% truth you heard somewhere something mentioned which is completely irrelevant to some cases and you just write it down like you know your stuff about it :D

The higher the IR (internal resistance) the lower the c-Rating.
The lower the IR the faster you can discharge the battery.

If the IR is different on the hole pack the whole pack can get out of Balance.

it is fact that charging to 42 Volt is not healthy because you gain a Little bit extra capacity 20% but 40% less life span compared to 41V. (The numbers could be wrong but i think youll get me). Leaving the pack at 42v means charging --> reached 42V --> released and got to 40.9 --> charged again. (because it holds 42v just for a couple minutes)

That way the IR will raise faster. Am i wrong?

A battery that stays at higher charge state suffers faster degradation, that means that with time, even without discharging the internal resistance will go up

There is a reason most electric vehicles manufacturers make the available energy less than what the battery has or recommend the user to not use full charge daily

[/quote]
Correct. Older batteries have higher internal resistance. As you cycle batteries and use them over time the IR rises. This is important because, voltage sags proportionally with internal resistance, double the IR, double the voltage sag at a specified current. IR changes not only over the cycle lifetime of a cell but also during a single discharge cycle, I forget what the curve looks like exactly but IR is high at high voltage and at low voltage. It is way more pronounced in LiPos than Li-ions. If you look at a constant current discharge graph the voltage drops rapidly in the first bit and then steadies itself out and then drops rapidly in the last bit. This is due to IR changes. Also why your battery gets warmer towards the end of charging/discharging. 

Over time, IR rises and you hit your low voltage cutoff sooner and sooner. When this time is equivalent to 75-80% of the the time the cell has as new, then they call it dead. Manufacturers try to put this in the 200-300 cycle range. As an example, 30Q cells can discharge at 22A continuously without any cooling. But their cycle life is only 200ish cycles, by limiting the current to 15A, they were able to increase this to 300ish cycles. 

Here's the relevant pages from their spec sheet:
![image|328x500](upload://xDQFOjPA7EgkpooDv1D0Y4EWeZ9.jpeg)

I hope this helps with your understanding.

This, lower at almost full charge, little bit higher at full charge and way higher when empty

That's why you don't wan't to discharge to 0% if you wan't to have the maximum cycle life, for the same current, you have a lot more heat going into the cell at low state of charge, and more heat = faster degradation

P.S. If all your theories and scientific BS are so good why nobody uses it? Show me any of stuff implemented in like consumer level :) All those talks about charging until specific voltages and etc and still, you use same plain old BMS chargers which act like everything else so at the end of the day it doesn't matter.

If a charger keeps the battery at 4.2V, the IR will rise faster over time (and degrade faster) than if it was at storage.

To a certain point I agree with you, a battery for our boards isn't that expensive you can't afford to replace when it is not performing as good as you wan't

But if you can make something last way more by just following some simple steps, why not? less money wasted, less cells having to be recycled, less pollution from shipping, etc etc

The effect is small? Yes, for one person, if everybody do that kind of thinking in everything they do every day is lot

But for battery's and extending cycle life:

* **Charge only what you need:**

     My board can do 40km, but my round trip commute is 9km, I charge it to 39V, still have plenty of power and range, and my battery's will last way more

* **If full charge is needed, make it be ready when you are about to leave:**

     The less time the battery pass at full charge the better, less time to the electrolyte decompose and lower the battery performance and life

     The exception would be if you charge to a lower voltage, then you can put it to charge at night and not worry about

* **Wait for it to cool before charging:**
      
     Same thinking, the aging process happens way more quicker at higher temperatures, by pumping current at it while at it's peak temperature you are just making it happen faster

I understand your points, and I believe they are good but how many people afford to check what level is battery at then charging most of them just plug them in and lets it finish charging. I will try to experiment with this sutff as I am designing my whole management system from scratch because good stuff is not available for consumers. 

For e.g. how many of those BMS used her calculates coulomb in/out of battery, P groups each cell voltage (It's really hard to spot dead cell in 5P groups as other cells in group just hide that cell low voltage) there is many key points from science you can do for battery to make it last longer but how convenient are they?

P.S. Thanks for reminding to charge my board :D

Yeah, but a simple charger with adjustable end of charge and habit make it happen

On the BMS department we really need something adjustable, Battman was suposed to be that, now looking forward to @SimosMCmuffin BMS, the more options we have the better

P.S. Your welcome

@DeathCookies

Even if your charger measure 42V on the output your battery will never get to that. The vast majority of charger terminate after the current drops to a certain level, usually C/10, if you charge at 5A, it will stop charging at 0.5A, and since all battery's have and internal resistance the end of charge voltage will always be lower

Nope, BMS protects only over current over voltage (some over temperature) :) Charger disconnects then its finished charging not BMS.

Some decent ones has some more protections :) But all those BMS require CC/CV charger :) BMS does not regulate charging current :)

Lipo and Li-Ion likes to be stored for longer at low voltages ( somewhere between 3.5 and 3.95V)
They don't like to be charged fast continuously.
They like to be used from 80% to 20% (like 4.05V till 3.5V without load)
If you charge them till 4.2V they **hate** to be charged with high currents above 80%.

Long story short. Store them for longer periods below 3.95V, charge them slowly and try to use them from 80% till 20%.
When you use them wile riding don't worry about anything as long as you don't discharge them to 0%. But by setting a cutoff end of 3.0V for Li-Ion or 3.3V for Lipo that won't happen. 

(These values are for conditions under load so don't be surprised that they are lower)

Lipo are basically dead (at least mine) at ~3.2-3.3V they don't really have something to push :) I think my cut off is like 3.4V/cell right now. Fast charging depends on chemistry and model and etc... For e.g. my lipos are charged at 5C without any permanent damaged or capacity loss (doesnt even get warm), I have over few hundred cycles like that :) And always follow the capacity coloumb in/out of battery so even after over 200 cycles capacity loss is like max 10%

For information on battery matters for most battery chemistries a good starting point is often the excellent site at [Battery University](http://www.batteryuniversity.com/).
NB: What I have written below is based both on experience and on input from a wide range of sources, including battery university.

### Assume for following discussion a manufacturers spec of

* Maximum current = CCmax (usually 1C for LiIon but may be other for specific cells).
Assume CCmax is 1C for the cell in question for convenience.
Actual spec will be as per datasheet and is temperature dependant and also depends on how many charge/discharge cycles you wish to achieve before the battery turns to mush and/or is reduced to say 70% of original capacity.

* Maximum voltage of Vmax - usually 4.2V or less. Say 4.2V for now.
As for current, the maximum Voltage applied will affect cell longevity (and capacity on a given charge). Charging at a terminal voltage of much above 4.2V will shorten you cell life, may lead to metallic lithium plating out and can lead to the exciting and equipment eating "vent with flame" battery meltdown phenomenon.

* Minimum current of Icv_min when charging at Vmax. This is the **minimum** that current should be allowed to fall to when charging in **CV** mode. When in CV mode, charging is terminated when current drops to this level. Icv_min is typically set at somewhere between 25% of Icc (early charge termination) and say 10% of Icc (maybe sometimes even 5% of Icc). The lower Icv_min is set the longer current trickles into the battery at Vmax in CV mode. Setting a low value of Icv_min adds slightly to the energy that can be stored in the battery on a given cyccle AND utterly tears the battery apart inside and shortens it life.

### These two important points apply:

The **maximum** voltage **AT** the battery (1 cell) under maximum constant current CCmax is Vmax = 4.2V in this case.

**BUT** the **maximum** voltage **AT** the battery (1 cell) under ANY current is also Vmax.
If the battery will not accept Imax when Vmax is applied then CC mode is no longer appropriate. Charging should be CV (or terminated if Icharge at Vmax is <= Icv_min - see below)

An important point here is where you measure what you call "the charging voltage".
This is properly measured at the cell electrodes as close to the cell internals as possible. In practice anywhere on the (usually) weld-attached tabs should be OK as at the max allowed current the voltage drop across the tabs should be minimal. As long as the voltage at the actual cell is <= Vmax then the voltage at other points in the charger may be > Vmax if the charger design requires it.

Consider: Apply a "true" constant current source to a discharged LiIon cell.
There will be lead resistance external to the cell so the voltage elsewhere to the system may be higher than at the battery terminals. Ignore that for now - comment on this at end.
For a discharged LiIon battery the terminal voltage will be somewhere around 3V and will slowly rise as CC is applied.

After about 40 to 50 minutes of charging a LiIon cell at 1C (= CCmax in this case) from fully discharged the TERMINAL voltage will reach 4.2V. **This** is where you stop applying CC and apply a CV of Vamx (= 4.2V in this case) at whatever current it takes to keep the voltage at 4.2V (up to a maximum of CCmax.)

The following paragraph may sound a little complex but it is important. It does make sense - read and understand if you care about the answer to the question that you asked.
It is a fallacy to think that you must apply a higher voltage at the cell to get it to accept CCmax when Vcell is at Vmax.
This IS true if the battery is fully charged or is charged above the point in the cycle where Vcell first reaches Vmax when charging at CCmax.
BUT that is because you are then trying then to do something which is outside the proper charging "envelope".
IF a LiIon cell will not accept CCmax when Vmax is applied it should be charged at not above Vmax until Ibattery falls to Icv_min.
If you apply Vmax and Ibattery is below Icv_min then the battery is fully charged and you should remove Vcharge. Leaving a battery connected indefinitely to a voltage source of Vmax when Icharge is less than Icv_min will damage the battery and reduce or greatly reduce its cycle life.

Charging voltage is removed when Icharge falls below Icv_min to prevent potentially irreversible electrochemical reactions and to prevent Lithium metal "plating out".
If Vmax is set at 4.15V then charge capacity is reduced noticeably but cycle life is extended.
If Vmax is set at 4.1V charge capacity is significantly reduced and cycle life is significantly extended.
The loss of capacity per cycle that occurs when Vmax is reduced leads to an overall INCREASE in total lifetime capacity as the extension in life cycles rises faster than the per cycle capacity falls. If you care mainly about highest capacity per charge set Vmax as high as allowed and accept low cycle life.
If you can tolerate say 80% to 90% of max possible capacity per cycle, set Vmax lower and get more overall energy storage before replacement.

The graph below from Battery University article [How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries](http://www.batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries) shows what happens when Vmax is increased above 4.2V.

![image|429x289](upload://5EAf2CJc3YwyPNqHrZzYICXD2bi.jpg)

At the end are 3 tables from the same battery University page which show the effects on cycle life from varying various parameters (depth of discharge, temperature, Vmax)

## Internal voltage versus terminal voltage:

There will be internal resistance in the cell so the "real" potential in the cell proper during charging at CC will be less than at the terminals. At CV the internal voltage will approach the external voltage as Icharge "tapers off".

**IF** you want to play 'fast and loose' with all manufacturers' specs and all advice given you can assume that you can 'allow' for this resistance and guestimate a true internal voltage which is lower than the terminal voltage. May the force be with you and with your battery, and may it live long and prosper - but, it probably won't.

Three excellent tables from Battery University showing how cycle life varies with various parameters.

By manage charging I meant that you would be able to use simple power supply basically any or at least same voltage and it would manage charging current for e.g. If I connect 42V 100A PSU and I want to charge max 5A it would regulate current to 5A and then capacity reaches maximum (current draw drops like low enough it would disconnect power from charging) or even would do CV/CC like @SimosMCmuffin BMS :slight_smile:

At the moment we use CC/CV charger bricks which at then reaches maximum V and current draw drops it disconnects its output and turns LED to green.

This is not true. There is a reason why Tesla has a trip limit on their battery to avoid staying at high charge for a long time. It does increase the cells capacity and that’s why they should be charged to a storage voltage when not in use for longer periods and topped off to max (or as much as you need) before you use it.

Every normal Power brick will do cc within its specs. A 42v 2a does Not give you 10a. So it would Charge all the time with 2a even if it is Full. But then the bms steps in and regulates the current Going to the battery.
A cccv charger is even better and can also do cv. It does the hard Part for the bms. 

In my mind a cccv charger is only necessary if you attach it directly to the cells instead of the bms or the bms could draw 20a and your Power supply could deliver enough Watts.

But then it would be a beefy bms and i do not think that it could t handle the cv Part as Well.

And when does the balancing Kicks in? In your theory it would load till 100% and shuts it self of...

But actually the Power brick or the cccv charger does Not turn off! Power brick will provide its current (empty battery it will be even more than the specs because of wattage) and a cccv charger only enough current to hold the voltage. Now the bms can Balance the cells.

But u should Balance more than one hour though

Edit: the bms will protect the cell for over Charge. If one cell is Full it wont feed the whole Pack before it unloads a bit capacity of the Full cell. Even if you provide less (cccv) or much current (Power brick). But the less current the less Power get lost while charging/balancing

Green part is independent from pink part. If you manage to overcharge cells while braking cell balancing will kick in. You can also plug in only 1S 3S or what ever on that side it doesn't matter for pink side.

Pink side has some discrete componets and op amps which limits current going in and out and also voltages thats all it doenst give a shit about any single of cell its job is to limit for e.g. Whole pack voltage to 3.4*12 to 4.2*12 and max 10A discharge and charrge that's all...

Balancing kicks in the moment Cells voltage reaches the threshold doesn't matter if whole other cells are undervoltage

@Kug3lis can we have a re run on the IR at full charge discussion?

I thought that Batteries at full Charge Degrade faster thus translating into Higher IR (aka Ageing effect)
Was that so dumb? I've found the old topic That I've Read the IR thing from.
> From what I understand any amount of time at full charge increases IR and the effect is cumulative.
> So, storing at full charge for two days five times is the same as storing them at full charge for 10 days straight.

And of course not many would buy a battery with charger that has 20% less capacity because they only charge to 4.0V.

But finally we shouldn't really care. Even 300 cycles with a 30km range battery (e.g 10S4P) will give us something like 7500 km (capacity becomes lower with each cycle). And that is under worst conditions. 

Simple rule (or advice, tip, recommendation, hint) should be to not keep it fully charged when you store the board.

There is no such thing as a pure cc charger. They all have a voltage limit. As you stated, a 42V 2A charger is in fact a cc/cv charger. It will charge 2A at any voltage under 42V. It cannot charger to a voltage above 42V. As the voltage of the battery approaches 42V, the current pushed through it will decline per the following...
DV = Vc - Vb = I * Ri
Vc = Charger output voltage
Vb = no load Vbatt
I = charging current
Ri = Battery Internal resistance

---

The difference between a power supply and a charger is the defined constant current provided by a charger and an end of charge current. A power supply may be rated for 10A but does not actually regulate to 10A, it may simply have a fuse that will blow at 10A. 

For power supplies, they define a max load and it's your job to stay under it. For a charger, they define max power output, regardless of your power needs. This is obviously not true for all supplies but is generally true for cheap ones. 

Enough on that tangent...

Ish... 
Most BMSs can only turn on/off charging. So if you were charging at 2A, and the BMS saw a cell reach 4.2V. It would turn off charging for all cells altogether while it enables the discharge resistor for the specific cell. The way it works is that above a specific voltage for each cell, the balancing resistor will get enabled, this could be anywhere between 3.9V-4.1V and is unrelated to the overall charging function. The resistor can only dissipate so much power, lets say 150mA. So if your battery is charging at 2A and balancing is enabled for 1 cell, then that specific cell is charging at 1.85A while the others are charging at 2A. This goes great with CC/CV chargers as the overall current approaches zero and then the balance resistor can take all if not even discharge an over charged cell. 

Now, the second part of the BMS is turning on/off charge/discharge. In my experience, a good BMS will be able to take the input of all cells as a group as well as all cells individually and decide to turn charging on/off based on that. If a single cell reaches 4.2V, while the others are at 4V, charging should stop until some balance threshold is achieved. 

For example in my BMS, that threshold is 100mV/50mV. All cells need to be within 100mV regardless of the voltage for charging to be enabled and within 50mV of each other if a cell is above 4.1V. ***This is not normal from a cheap BMS, I spec'ed out my own and got it from Texas Instruments*** but most good BMSs will have a threshold of like 150mV. 

Other than that, the BMS will have a turn off and turn on voltage threshold for charging. Eg, if cell is above 4.2V, turn off. Turn on if cell is below 4.05V. This means that your cells will not be charging for eternity. This goes hand in hand with the low current limit on CC/CV chargers. CC/CV chargers will stop charging if they cannot charge faster than 0.xxA. Mine is 0.1A. So there is some redundancy. If my charger is faulty and never stops charging then the BMS will tell it to stop unless the battery actually needs charging. Same thing if my Bms is faulty, then the Charger should stop itself if charging too slow. You would need two failures for it to even become a problem. That is a main theme with power systems, be redundant in your protection in different places. Some may think it's stupid until their shit's on fire.

This. Thanks for the lengthy comment, very spot on.

That being said, depending on the BMS, usually cheap ones don’t balance before a cell reaches a certain voltage. The balancing act also can happen if the charger is not plugged in.

I’ve talked to BesTech and they confirmed their BMS will balance even if charger is not plugged in. However, because the balance only happens when a cell goes above a certain value, it’s not a good idea to only charge to let’s say 80% for many many cycles. While this would increase the battery life (I do top up many times and unplug at 80% because I know I don’t need more), it also means the balancing act, if required, cannot begin because the cells are below the threshold.

As far as I know, it’s best to not charge to 100% unless you need it and you are about to use it... but at the same time, if you kept your battery between 80%-20% for many cycles, it’s good to do a 100% charge every now and then so that the BMS can re-balance the pack if needed.

Do you know at what voltage they start balancing?

It is okay to not balance as long as you're not abusing the cells. In fact, it is better for the cells not to be balanced every cycle. The reasoning is that when you balance, your cells spend hours near 4.2V which can be detrimental for them while an unbalanced charge can be done within 30mins of the cells hitting 4.2V. 

Also balancing isn't needed that often. I usually go 20-30 cycles between balance charging and my cells will be within 10mV. I do check them after every cycle though. One thing balancing does is that it protects you when a cell goes bad, so if a particular cell goes bad and you don't balance for another 20-30 cycles, things could get really bad. I don't know if you saw my post about the battery that was perfectly balanced when charged but definitely had a bad cell within the group. I'll post a link below...

As far as I know, it’s best to not charge to 100% unless you need it and you are about to use it… but at the same time, if you kept your battery between 80%-20% for many cycles, it’s good to do a 100% charge every now and then so that the BMS can re-balance the pack if needed

Yep! Thats the best practice. Also don't forget to check voltages yourself after every season. Both fully charged and discharged. It can save your butt.

It is okay to not balance as long as you’re not abusing the cells. In fact, it is better for the cells not to be balanced every cycle.

I think @whitepony would Support this! He is mostly running without bms because you dont really Need one with Quality cells in a well designed board (enough p rows for the application).

When you have several boards and/or work often with cells, it seems to be a good option to use balance charger instead of BMS.

Balance chargers allow to tune the termination voltage and balance cells even at 80%. You can also decide if you want to balance cells of not, you can adjust the input current depending on your needs and time.

Finally they provide several additional features like IR measurment and multiple checks for safe charging.

Do you know at what voltage they start balancing?
[/quote]

This is what I have from Bestech themselves:

> 3)Once the voltage of a single cell reach 4.20V+/0.025V, the balancing start.
After battery pack is fully charged, PCM will detect each cell's voltage and trim higher voltage down until other cells reach the same voltage level. 

And

> Once the voltage of a single cell reach balance voltage 4.20V+/0.025V, the balancing start. It no need to leave the charger.

These are simple bms modules so one balancing module inside the bms doesn’t talk to the other, meaning there is no way to start balancing before a cell reaches 4.2v. If you charge a pack and at one point a cell (A) charges faster (or it wasn’t as discharged as the other to begin with) and reaches let’s say 3.8v while another (B) is at 3.7v, the bms wouldn’t know that A cell is higher than the B one. However, as cell A reaches 4.2v, the B one is still at 4.1v. So the charger keeps charging, but the BMS is seeing cell A at 4.2v already and starts discharging it via the resistor, essentially keeping it at 4.2v. At the same time cell B is still charging and at some point it reaches 4.2v as well. Cell A was kept in check and didn’t go beyond 4.2 while cell B was allowed to catch up. When the charging act finishes, both are at 4.2v, so balanced.

As far as I understand it’s a simple process: if any cells reach 4.2v, they are kept there as lower ones catch up. This is why a 100% charge is needed every now and then, otherwise there is nothing to balance them. It’s also why if you build a pack and mismatch voltages across the cells/P groups, the first charge will be tricky: either the bms can hold the higher ones at 4.2v while the others catch up or (if the balancing current is not high enough and the mismatch is too big), it will stop charging because the already high voltage cells cannot be kept at 4.2 due to more current going into them compared to what the resistor can eliminate.

The important thing is that since there is no communication to find out what voltage the other cells have, they can’t be balanced as their voltage goes up. You would reduce the time needed to balance if you start as soon as the battery is being charged: check all voltages across the cells and if you find a difference, slow down the higher ones from the first second the pack started charging and allow the lower ones catch up... but because there is no communication like that in a simple bms, it literally just waits until a cell is at 4.2v and keeps it there until the others are catching up.

That being said, I checked my 10s4p pack (30Q) and after 400 miles on it, it never was unbalanced. I check when discharged, to see if they drifted during discharge phase, and at the end of a 80% charge, to see if they charge at the same rate. And since they are quality cells, they seem to degrade at similar rates, essentially keeping the balance perfect.

I also check at 100% just to make sure things are ok. I do this every 30 or so cycles.

Oh man, I wish there was some kind of flexible configurable BMS being developed at the moment as an open-source project that would allow you to use any battery configuration between 4-12 cells and give more options on what kind of charger to use, while still allowing you to configure what voltage the cells are charged to and also support an e-switch as an optional module for different discharge currents and support multiple comms buses (USART & CAN) allowing you to for example link it to your CAN enabled motor controller and from there forward battery info to your smartphone for live monitoring, so you can run your battery packs the way _you_ want... Oh and also allow for auto-turn off after configurable time (if using e-switch) and allow to discharge the batteries to programmable storage voltage after certain time...

hint, hint, plug, plug...

My main issue with running without a BMS is that you get rid of some VERY VERY important safety features. What happens when a cell goes bad? Even quality cells go bad. What happens when your charger takes a dump on you? What happens when your ESC fucks up?

The BMS is meant to be your last line of protection, running without one is careless imo.

Agreed, balance chargers are better in that you get to see a lot more of what goes on, it still doesn't completely replace a BMS. Remember that a BMS is also a protection circuit. For me, the end game is have protection circuitry on board and balancing circuitry off board. I'm getting close to this with my personal setup but it's slow going...

@egzplicit, they have several variations of the same BMS. The one I got from Bestech starts at 4.15V and at some point I had one that started at 4.05V. But yeah, the fact that they don't communicate voltage spread sucks. Which is why I went custom...

They can configure the voltages when you order them. I was asked what values I need and they baked it in the bms. But yes, at the end of the day it’s a very simple and rather dumb device (that we still need!).

@SimosMCmuffin I had my eyes on these fancy bms versions for a while. I just wish they became available to buy like any other product, click click, 3 days later it’s delivered. I’m sure there would be a market for them here, but they need to be tested and ready to ship to whoever needs one.

While its not quite as good as the Flexi will be this was my compromise. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/12S-100A-smart-board-lipo-lithium-Polymer-BMS-PCM-PCB-battery-protection-board-for-18650-Li/32848466970.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dJEfxWa

It lets you monitor per cell voltages from your phone and change settings (tho i've heard mixed review of this lol) and it does give you way more customization then any other similarly priced BMS i've found so far.

The only downsides I've found so far are they are fairly chunky especially anything over 80A and the balance current is lower than i'd like (55+/-5 mA). 

There's a lot of features that aren't even talked about like traces for a switch and a status indicator LED are on the board and not mentioned anywhere (switch needs to be enabled through the software.

Honestly I'm surprised more people aren't using these, and while I haven't put mine through enough use to give you a full recommendation it was the only thing that I thought was worthwhile getting in the BMS department.

I did consider a 123SmartBms as well but they're way to fucking expensive. But they definitely have way more features but its a little more applicable to larger storage applications.

can someone confirm if the balancers on a cheap bms work independently or does the whole charge stop until all cells are under some setting?  I imagine there's a million different version but how about these specifically.  the red circle in the pic.  I bought a couple i haven't messed with but understood that they all worked independently so theres no stopped charge on the pack or the individual cell and it just bleeds the cell that's too high at some crappy rate, and that's all it does.![bms balancer|690x425](upload://ixcoQRv2OCiLNJgoGFNbCVdLp8J.png)

Yes, they are using independent balancer ic's you can get those balancers independent from bms
