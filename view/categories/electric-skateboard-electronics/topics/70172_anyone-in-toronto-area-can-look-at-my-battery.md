I had a battery built last year and it doesn't seem to be functioning correctly.

It only charges to 29.5 V and then the charger turns green (it is 8s3p made with 30Q's). I would think this is a BMS issue but I am not sure and was wondering if anyone who is knowledgeable about batteries in the Toronto, Ontario area could take a quick look at it.

Any help on here would also be much appreciated. 

Thanks very much,
Jacob
