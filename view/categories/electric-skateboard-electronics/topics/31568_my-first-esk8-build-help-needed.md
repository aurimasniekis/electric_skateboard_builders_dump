As you probably can see, I'm new to all this "electric longboards". I have recently startet at my build. So i started off by buying som electronics from hobbyking. The items I bought was one "Turnigy sk3 245kv" motor, a" hobbyking 100A SBEC" esc, some 6s batteries and a "Hk-gt2b 3 ch" transmitter and reciever. I soldered on some EC3 connectors, and connected everything. First it did'nt work, until i understood that you needed to pull the trigger before you connected the batteries, to the ESC. But now I have an issue that for stopping the motor I need to pull in the trigger. When i slip it, the motor starts running? Do anyone know what the problem may be? Help is appreciated!

Maybe need to calibrate the throttle range, have you done this?
