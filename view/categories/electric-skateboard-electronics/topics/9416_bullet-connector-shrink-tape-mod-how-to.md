Nice touch with the screwdriver handle for that perfectly round opening. This is a good mod.

Why not just heat the shrink tubing directly while the phase wires are connected to the enclosure? What benefit does the screwdriver method offer?

Because if you shrink it while they are connected, they will be stuck together and you won't be able to disconnect them without stretching and ruining the sleeve.

By using the screw bit driver, the sleeve is just large enough to slide on and off.

Then you can have the extra insulation and still have the quick disconnect option.
