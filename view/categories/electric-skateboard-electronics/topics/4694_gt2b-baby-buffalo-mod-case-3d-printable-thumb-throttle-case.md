I'm a big fan of the nunchuck form factor, but I got a little tired of the drops and full-speed throttle stick incidents (Nyko Kama to Vesc). I love the reliability of the GT2B, but the case is huge and I've never liked the trigger throttles. So, inspired by BadWolf and a couple other mod cases I've seen here, I decided to start this project.

**Goals:**
* Compact- a bit bigger than the Nyko Kama, but easily fits in the hand and doesn't look like a gun.
* Minimal modification to gt2b hardware- battery needs to be "peeled" and leads soldered on, small part of the POT mount needs to be filed (or you can remove the POT pcb and solder directly to the POT leads).
* Sturdy- case is a minimum 2mm thick, more in high-stress/likely impact points

I've got it posted on thingiverse as well: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1626414. But, you're better off going to onshape and exporting your own .stl as the file is changing daily at this time.

I've been slowly learning OnShape as I go with this project, I had zero parametric CAD modelling experience prior to starting this case project a few weeks ago (mostly I've been using sketchup). OnShape is awesome for me as it's web browser based, I can draw a little during downtimes at work, I can draw at home, I can draw on my phone or tablet- and it's FREE (as long as you fit the criteria). So, please, if you see something that could be done better/more efficiently let me know- I'd love to get some feed back from experienced modellers.

This project is still very much Beta- let me know if you run into any problems and feel free to modify the files as you need (I'd love to see what you do with this, so please post links!). 

**Assembly Tips:**
_I hope to make a little better tutorial once we iron out the kinks, but here're some tips to help you early printer/adopters._

* Case sides are designed to be printed flat side down without supports, same for the thumb throttle.
* Steering POT is a 90 degree turn, trigger throttle pot is 50 degree- as it sits, I'm using the steering POT, but i plan on adding support for the 50 degree (short throw version).
* See pic on the battery, insert as shown to the right case half (should be snug) and is held in place by the PCB.
* PCB and throttle mount with shorter screws, case halves go together with the longer screws (all screws taken from the GT2B during disassembly).
* Dab some hot glue on the antenna wire where it's soldered to the board (unless you like soldering really tiny/annoying shit back together).
* Antenna fits in the "U" slots of the right case half- this is a very recent addition and I haven't tested this print just yet.
* Thumb throttle is a tight press fit onto bare POT d-shaft, original plastic shaft must be removed.
* I originally designed the POT mount to have the PCB removed and just solder the wires directly to the POT legs, but you can leave the PCB attached and bend it backward to fit in the case (see pic) by cutting/shaving a little plastic off the steering POT mount itself.
* Use the spring from the trigger throttle on the steering POT- it's stiffer and gives better/positive feedback.

awesome, but why the cutouts for the trim and other dials? How often do you end up using them? It would also be nice to have thicker walls and a spot for a wriststrap like the wii remote.

For sure, a wrist-strap mounting point will be an easy addition.

The main reason for the cut-outs is to keep the case as slim as possible- as it sits, it's a hair over 1" thick. I've gone through a few (read twenty plus!) iterations of this case and anything approaching 1.25" thick begins to feel unwieldy. The trim knobs sit just below the surface, so they are not easily inadvertently turned. The power switch is easy to manipulate as it sits just proud of the case mount and has a bevel around its opening.

As to the need for thicker walls, I'd rather re-enforce areas we find to be weak with fillets or strategically placed bracing on an as-needed basis. Thicker walls in a 3d print is not necessarily stronger, depending on your geometry and print medium.

Thanks for the response guys. @FLATLINEcustoms I'm sure you burned through a fair bit of filament with that sexy mad munkey case, that thing looks awesome! 

Progress update:  

I've printed the right side case with the antenna holder and it fits nice and snug. I've adjusted the left side case hole to better fit the POT body- CAD file is up to date, but not the .stl on thingiverse.

**Another tip:** 

Ream the holes out with a 5/64" drill bit and the screws will fit perfect.

Thank you @Qwiksand! Yes many many reels were harmed in the making of that enclosure. Haha, I should post a pic of the prototypes before the working one existed. 

I like that you redesigned and printed a new trigger for the thumb.

I've printed a version without LED cut-outs from natural PETG, it's my favorite thus far- stuff looks like frosty diamonds. I've also created a thumbstick that works with the 50 degree sweep trigger POT (shorter POT in the images), but I haven't tested this one yet.

I've put about 40 miles on the 90 degree steering POT as thumbstick- it's awesome! Much better, precise control, even on my simple FVT 120a controller.

Here're some better pics- you should be able to make out the general assembly process from the following:

That is pretty slick!  Nicely done and executed!!!

I'd love to see it slimmer without the USB (or moved).  If without - perhaps with the QI charger like flatline demonstrated!

very cool.  I might have to try this since my GF like the thumb throttle better than trigger.  I rode last night w/ her niece (on her board) and she had a couple drops on the Kama/Wii...

I second that. The remote looks really intriguing with potential for an even sleeker look. @Qwiksand you should try to optimize it a little more and then this could be the go to enclosure next to the mad munkey.

Also as you can see in the mad munkey thread we found out that there are versions of the GT2B with different battery sizes out there. So your battery recess might not fit all of them.

@lowGuido This is good ol' 'Merican Steez, not to be confused with whatever it is that qualifies as steez across the pond ;)

@Maxid and @sl33py- I designed around the USB to eliminate the challenge of de-soldering/relocation, basically tried to remove as many barriers to entry for the less experienced DIY'ers out there (I type that like everyone has a 3d printer, but you get what I mean :stuck_out_tongue:). The only real soldering needed for this case is on the battery leads. 

The USB nub in this version actually helps you to hold the case- or maybe I've just gotten used to it and I'm making excuses now :sunglasses:

Of course, this is why I've made the source files available to anyone who cares to hack- happy modding!

Thanks for the feedback guys, I appreciate the responses

Dude, I almost called it the "Baby Buffalo" case! Either that, or it also reminds me of a fetal pig, but buffalo is definitely better. Either way, it's certainly a case of function over form!

@lowGuido Thanks for the clarification and sorry for the "false advertising". From here on out, when you see "steez", read "baby buffalo".

Damn, that looks real good! Thanks for sharing, may very well print this and see which feels more natural compared to the badwolf case mod. 
Thumb control seems to me like a better way to go since it would be easier to lock the throttle in one position for any length of time.

Trying to rework my badwolf into this and I have to put on a new USB connector because I got a little glue inside it when making the badwolf. I would assume red to VCC and black to ground but which does the white pin go to? Looking at the traces it looks like it doesn't go to anything but I want to be sure.

Well I fried my GT2B so I had to buy another one, guess it's destiny to make the baby buffalo....

Overall I really like how easy it is to put together but the standoffs to hold the potentiometer down are kind of flimsy to get those tapping screws in. Also I am having minor issues with the response of letting go of the throttle and it not snapping exactly back into place, the D slot on the throttle piece is way too big. It is a little thick but it's understandable because of the almost zero modifcation to fit in the case. 

Will be using as my main controller.

Excellent, the first I've seen out in the wild. The D-shaft tolerance must be dead on or too much slop and you won't have the precise control you need to ride. My thumbstick prints tend to either fit very tight straight off the printer or require just a bit of fine shaving with an exacto knife to fit.

I must admit, the D-shaft hole is fine tuned to my printer/slicer settings and you may need to fiddle with the cad to make it work as well for yours. Let me know if you need any help tweaking the files.

For reference, I prototyped this using the following basic settings in Slic3r:

E3DV6 hotend, 0.4mm nozzle
.32mm layer height
4 shells/perimeters
4 layers top and bottom
Anywhere from 10 to 25% infill
```

How did I fry it? Well not entirely sure but I had to rewire a new usb connector which I checked a million times if the polarity is right and it was, however it still fried, might have needed that third wire afterall? Or I wasn't supposed to cut off the left part of the pcb to make room in the mad munkey and it caused something to short. All I know is I don't want to do it again so I don't plan to make another mad munkey right now. 

@Qwiksand
Yea I consider my printer very finely tuned in terms of perimeter thickness and backlash etc... but every printer is different. I have that same nozzle and extruder though! I might just shrink the whole part by 2% or so to get a better fit because the part has some slop on the shaft and sometimes won't get into the correct range to coast when letting go of the throttle.

Can do. How loose is the fit? Do you have a way to measure (caliper and drill bits, etc)?

How about on the stepped portion of the d-shaft (the actual "D" shaped part), is the fit sloppy on the flat (try inserting the D-shaft first or backwards to check this fit)?

Great feedback, thanks for the pics.

I've added several different steering pot thumbsticks with varying inside diameters to [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1626414).

Hopefully one of those'll work, or you can stop by @lowGuido 's house and pick up some hot glue

I've build 3 or 4 badwolf modified GT2b's now.  I have 2 more on their way - one destined for the baby buffalo.  It's great to have options for those who like trigger vs thumb.  My GF is riding w/ a kama right now, and still sees occasional drops.  She prefers the thumb throttle, so thinking this will be for her.  Or if i absolutely love it, i'll make another for me.

Thanks for sharing this @Qwiksand - and look forward to trying it!

Since my trigger pot broke while making the monkey mod, I decided to make this one. Gotta say, I love it! Needs some perfecting, if I have time I'll try and do some tweaks, mainly ergonomics.

What do you think about adding a part so you can velcro on a flashlight?  I have done it on my copy.

That's actually not a bad idea for those who don't have LED headlights on their boards.  Will the weight of the flashlight be an issue with what looks to be a small piece of velcro?

Great mod! But did you successfully set up failsafe with the steering pot? Because with mine GT2B, only the throttle channel failsafe is working. When I try it with the steering pot and his channel, motors are doing this annoying "beeeep beeeep beeeep" sound  with discontinuous breaking during the signal loss.

I've not looked into the fail safe mode for the steering pot to tell the truth, mine does the exact same thing when I turn the transmitter off (beep, beep, beep...). To be fair, I have never purposefully changed the default fail safe on the throttle channel though either.

Now that you mention it, I don't think I've ever turned my transmitter off while riding the board- I'll have to try that out tomorrow and see what happens.

With all that said, I've put a couple hundred incident-free (at least from a throttle drop/hang perspective :wink: ) miles on this mod. But, you bring up a valid safety concern and everyone performing this mod should at least be made aware- thanks for posting!

Ok, if anybody is interested how to set up the failsafe. I try to connect steering pot to the trigger port but it was not working properly with mine fvt 120. Even after adjusting the internal trims and REV/NOR. What has been working for me is that I also swapped the brown and the yellow cable in the steering pot connector.:wink: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/f/6f0a426aacabf8c049304f873f6a9eca56a62d38.jpg" width="281" height="500">

Swapping those cables is the same as flipping the direction switch.

Yes, I swapped the cables in the housing. And for gt2b / ftv 120A combo, swapping the cables is not the same as flipping the direction switch. Without swapping the cables, the reverse isn't working properly ([check out the beeping sound in the video](https://youtu.be/IH1n1DIfhnk)  ).

Yeah, if its something like the HK 150A ESC you have to recalibrate the throttle range. I also noticed that when connecting the steering pot to channel 2 on the gt2b, there's a bias, so when the throttle is neutral, it actually sits at about 65% of the range instead of 50%. I will try and print a new thumb lever with different rotations to see which one gets it closer to 50%.

Shapeways or 3dhubs is your friend.  D/L the .zip of files, (.stl) and then upload them on 3dhub or shapeways.  3dhubs has local printers and is less $ (in my experience).  Shapeways does a great job and ships direct to you.  Both good options.

Another Baby Buffalo in the wild. Big thanks to Qwiksand and Chinzw for the remote! Feels great!
It's printed in white ABS and smoothed in Acetone vapour.

I added a little modification to seperate the pink and ring finger, not really needed but I thought I would. Pretty messy addition to the model so I won't post it unless someone really wants it.
I'm using the steering pot and found I was getting the throttle off set issue when plugged into the first port. So I switched to the steering port and channel 1 on the receiver.
Although it doesn't feel like it has the same response it had when using the traditional remote. Does the throttle channel have a throttle curve? Someone mentioned printing a thumb stick with built in offset, has this been posted?

Nice, stormtrooper motif! 

I believe @chinzw can hook you up with the rotated thumbstick for the throttle port. 

On the GT2B remote, the throttle POT is a 50 degree sweep and the steering POT is 90 degrees. I was looking for a longer throw to help modulate braking when using the cheapy FVT 120a ESC, so I went with the 90 degree (steering pot) hooked to channel 1 (steering channel) as this seems to be a 50/50 split of forward/reverse throw- makes sense since you would want to turn equally left and right.

It feels to me that the throttle port (channel 2) is more of a 60/40 split of forward/reverse- there's definitely less brake throw on the stock remote as compared to forward throttle anyway.

Been riding my board every chance I get at the moment. One thing I think it could do with is a beeper/buzzer. I'm tempted to get a lost buzzer to hook up to channel 3 on the receiver and wire it up on the remote.

I haven't used the mad monkey mod but the MasterCho mod which is very similar in overall shape and size(though I think mad monkey is more compact)  and I've used this baby buffalo. I personally prefer the MasterCho/Mad Munkey mod over this.  The feel in the hand is much nicer.  Both of the MasterCho and Mad Munkey mods are better fits ergonomically speaking. Although I think thumb stick is the most convenient form of control this design is just  slightly too larger the edges are just too hard even with the molded version with a fillet instead of a chamfer.

But THIS particular case is not very comfortable in your hand, and so feels less natural to hold. It's got some great potential but as it stands it could use some improvements. Unless you got some seriously large hands it might be more comfortable but the edges arent that user friendly.  If you got yourself some tiny Trump hands well you're fucked all together if you intend on using this.

@chinzw @cupo @qwiksand @JonathanLau1983 

I printed one of these and started riding with it lately.  Really nice controller.

I think I fixed the throttle stick so the steering pot on channel 2 is at 50% by default.  Did a 111 degree rotation on the shaft (believe it was at 90 degrees before, it's been a while since I modified it).  Mine shows up around 1.51 to 1.52 or so now.

Try it out and let me know if it works:

Hi, jut recently i tried a print of the babybuffalo, cause I'm also a Thumb-Person :wink::sleeping:

But for me the Baby is not a Baby anymore, so it feels more to have a grown-up Buffalo-Bull in my Hands - maybe they are too small to hold Buffaloes.

Still I wanted to have a Thumb-Remote, so i decided to Mod my Mad-Munkey to a Thumb-Index-Hybrid.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/3X/7/5/7501ea7f2945169ad5295f99cf690bab086a8b43_1_666x500.JPG
Printed in Woodfill, I love that Stuff, it actually smells like wood, feels like wood, and you can carve it like perfect Linden-wood.

So i carved out a slot for a linear pot (pulled back by a rubberband) it can be used to utilize channel1 for servo breaking, really smooth and fine thumb acceleration,........and whatever.

For me it combines the best of both "remote-worlds" Thumb and Index-Trigger. and the 50mm linear Pot just gives a really long travel for smooth-controlling, compared to the 20° availeable on the GT2B Trigger.

So in case of interest i starte a build-thread:

Is this an issue related to the GT2B itself or does it depend on the ESC you’re using?

Quick update: I printed this enclosure out and it’s a pretty good mod, I came from the bad wolf mod so I was kinda disappointed with the size, but It looks like it was pretty hard to get all that stuff to fit in there so I understand. 

However there is an issue with the failsafe for the steering channel on VESC. When I tested this on the bench, I held the throttle at a position to get the wheels moving and then shut it off. When I did this, there was a slight delay where the motors kept spinning for a few seconds, then my master motor shut off, and then my slave motor a bit later. This issue has made me roll to a stop while riding, and having to reconnect my remote. I’ve tried this with 2 different GT2Bs, and they both react the same way. Anybody have any idea what’s happening/ how to fix it?
