The switch on my space cell broke. Looks like the battery shifted around and jammed the switch against the enclosure opening on my Raptor. 
I have very little experience with electronics and looking for feedback:
1.) what's the minimum amp/volt rating needed for a replacement switch?
2.) any tips on - what to watch out for or be careful with when replacing?
3.) any alternative solutions to replacing switch. Not sure what those would be, just thought I'd throw it out there.

A few people are having this problem. I would contact @onloop and @EnertionSupport

The switch only carrys a very small load.
