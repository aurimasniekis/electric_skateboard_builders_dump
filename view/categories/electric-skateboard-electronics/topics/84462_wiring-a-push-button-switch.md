Evening

I was looking at replacing my power button on my board with a neat push button. I wasn't massively fussed about having it light up etc. I tried just wiring the positive and negative like my old switch. However that doesn't work. How can I get this working with or without the LED?

Hey,
I got the same switch for my board. If the wires that you use now don't close the circuit, you can try to use the beeping mode on a multimeter to test continuety to check wich wires close once you push the button. The wires you have connected now are for power for te switch I think.
Good luck
