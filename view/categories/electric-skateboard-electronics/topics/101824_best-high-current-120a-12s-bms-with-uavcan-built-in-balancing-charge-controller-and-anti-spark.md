I want to switch from pouch cells to 18650-type batteries, so I will need a good BMS. Does anyone have a recommendation for which is the best BMS for this job? 

I would like for the BMS to include an on-off switch with anti-spark so I don't need to unplug the battery from the motor controllers after each ride.
