Hey everyone, long time lurker here(iv'e made a couple of posts here and there but not too many).

 Anyway.... In the process of building a custom battery for my CGT but i can't find suitable nickel strip ANYWHERE IN THE USA. All my cells and other parts come in the next two days, but the nickel strip I ordered from china is MINIMUM a month out.

Have any of you guys found a reputable USA source/place to buy from? I am located in California.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks fellas.

This is the only one I know of but I think it's UK based. Not sure how quick their overseas shipping will be...

Well, I just bought some from ali-express that should be here in couple weeks. Had to buy a whole KG of it :open_mouth: . So i'll have some to sell in a couple weeks. 

Bought from this seller as it was linked a few times as reputable on endless sphere: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Thickness-0-2mm-Weight-1kg-Low-resistance-99-96-pure-nickel-for-battery-spot-welding-machine/32336236156.html?spm=a2g0s.8937420.0.0.cgDq3E

Ok. I went through the same process a while back and the answer was: you won't find any nickel strip vendor anywhere in USA. Go ahead and buy it from eBay in China, it will get to you in 1 week, the nickel is cheap so buy enough for 4 boards, you will need it in the future even though you think you won't

Guys you should consider nickel plated copper instead if you can. Good welding ability and better conductivity thus less losses in resistance. Better discharges, less heat, more range. Personally I use pure copper.

Can you spot weld pure copper?

I am planning on using 0.15mm nickel strips, with tinned copper braid soldered on top across all the serial connections

0.15mm x 7mm pure nickel strips are only good to about 5-6A before they start heating up significantly

How many nickel strips 0.25x7mm would you need for a 12s4p made of Samsung 30Q for full current flow?

I have only one on each of my 4P packs and my board runs amazing! I wonder if the strips run too hot and the maximum power is decreased by a low efficiency

you can use copper with this and the tool isn't too hard to make or you can buy it for maybe 3 or 4 times the cost of the spot welder.   copper strip kills nickel

Got my 5 meter roll from ebay. It seems to be legit nickel, hasn't rusted in the salt water solution(I put in a small piece to test). I will report back as well when my alibaba 1 kg roll comes. Heres the one i ordered off ebay: 

http://www.ebay.com/itm/5M-10mm-X0-15mm-0-394-X0-0059-Pure-Nickel-strip-Ni-tape-for-battery-welding/272115479452?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649

The amazon kalastar strips listed above are nickel plated steel for sure though. They are even rusting already in areas where i touched them with my fingers. 

I am a little worried though, because i ordered 0.20 thickness on my alibaba order. The sunkko welder is making pretty good welds with the 0.15, but i think 0.20 may be too thick. I'll report back and let you all know how that works out too.

I have the 709A, with the wedding pen .010" is the thickest I have been able to use @ 8Pulse when welding across the nickel strip, 6P when welding across the can to nickel strip.
.015 with the arms is the best I could do, however, using a small hole punch and placing a hole in the center of each pole, contacting the can and nickel strip should allow a thicker nickel strip to be used when using the pen.
The pulse needs to travel from each tip through the can, not through the nickel. This will give a better weld at the tip contacting the nickel.
The thinner the material, the greater the surface area needed, nothing can beat the current capacity of Ni Sheet....

@RootedSuperuser Sorry there is no link because I recycled from industrial machines and house parts. 

Alternative you can use is copper wires, size it accordingly to your individual cell's max wanted discharge and you obtain Tesla-style individual cell fuses.

where do you get it? Sourcing pure nickel strip is both expensive and difficult. I've basically given up and have been using 10mm 15mil nickel plated steel because that's what's available, and it can handle the abuse we put these big packs through just fine. But it takes a lot of heat to weld it. I'd rather be using a thinner metal that can carry the same or more current and doesn't require me to crank my sunkko all the way up and melt through a set of copper tips every pack and a half.

I got about 5kg worth earlier this year for my PowerWall build and ebike/esk8 builds. Since seeing the interest here I tried contacting the same supplier but haven't gotten a response :confused:
With most other suppliers that supposedly sell pure stuff the trick I found was to make your sample order pretty large..."sample" orders tend to be good stuff and you get screwed on consequent orders lol
I'm guessing that's something you've encountered before 😉

Btw, downed power lines are a great source of copper for tips

it is. I've also experienced the old "send you a sample then disappear and never return your emails" routine. Meanwhile i can get fuckloads of the stuff i have been using on ebay reliably. 

Ideally i would like a wide roll of it from which i can have stamped a particularly shaped strap to match the trapezoidal stacking pattern i use. Maybe what i should do is start back from the bottom and talk to metal stampers.

let me know how they receive your requests. IF they're willing to work with you on custom nickel stamps, then i want in. I have a design that would allow us to use the same 5P stamp on an entire pack with tabs for overlays on series connections and for mains connections. 

If i find something locally around here  I'll let you know.

I've had mixed luck there. That's what i have on my bench right now but somehow i just don't think its solid nickel. Its definitely got nickel on it and in it, and it definitely does the job, but i question the purity. 

In case anyone was wondering how to tell from a sample, sand it down and put it in salty water.

nickel plated steel
[/quote]

**Much higher resistance**, also it corrodes after some time just because finger oils and contaminants you expose it to during a build.
Can burn out and cause a break in the circuit.
Plated is really only good for making protection circuits on cells (5mm), you put a strip of Kapton tape on the bottom and top to seal it off..

How is anyone supposed to swap out 1 or 2 bad cells in the middle of the pack?
By their very own admission "A special epoxy based glue, very strong, almost impossible to break apart".
https://youtu.be/oNfTEHBz_bg?t=5m36s
Soooo, butcher the pack apart, damage 20% of the cells, rip the shrinkwrap on others and have to do MORE butchering and repairs?! 
Flat packs and hot glue is easily separated with Methyl Hydrate and a Q-Tip, EPOXY...%#@!&! ass difficult!

I really cant believe the stupidity of these so called "Professionals" that everybody accepts as the authority on building. The worst part of this is, stupid follows stupid and perpetuates the same stupid mistake. As a consequence it becomes the 'Norm' and accepted as the standard.....WTF?
Does anybody actually think for themselves anymore? As a society have we become so dumbed down that some of us should voluntarily take ourselves out of the gene pool so the species can survive?!

Am I the only one that has thought this thru?, I know there is 1 other commercially available product, from only 1 source that I have ever discovered, specifically for this type of build.
This, on the other hand is available EVERYWHERE......

You have valid points, but they make packs for production vehicles, failure means replacement not repair. "if 1 cell goes bad"  isn't a consideration for companies making packs with no intention of ever repairing.

I am loving the activity we have going on in this thread here, some of this discussion was apparently very well needed around here. Thanks for all the info @RootedSuperuser, @scepterr, @longhairedboy, @Vanarian,and @Jinra    

@RootedSuperuserI actually have the same welder(709), and have to admit, the hand probes are all but useless(very weak welds). I did see those cardboard insulators(I never thought of using the coin rolls though, nice idea), and will definitely be using them on ALL future builds. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/3X/1/0/10636dc203ce66e00ff5dd93858ef775e8e38d68_1_690x360.jpg

@RootedSuperuser Can I ask what exactly is wrong with the pack design in this photo? Is it the layout that you think is bad, or just the fact that nothing is insulated? Also, would the steel in nickel plated steel stips be carbon steel, or the stainless steel? 


I really wish I would have just purchased the adruino kit instead of the 709(https://malectrics.eu/). It seems so much for versatile, and not to mention it's less money. I just wanted something I could plug in and have it work, but that was a mistake imo. 

I agree with @longhairedboy 10000000 percent that using the machine mounted probes on the sunkko while trying to keep the cells aligned  is like an acrobatics act.  And, I also found it very difficult to source legit pure nickel strip. 

All in all, there were SO MANY things that I learned along the way building my first two packs. I am currently in the process of making a custom pack for my Carbon GT board, and lets just say iv'e learned quite a few lessons. Biggest thing I learned? INSULATE EVERYTHING TWICE. I found out the hard way that my CGT deck actually conducts electricity fairly well(enough to short out my pack twice before I figured out what I was going on). Also, Those cardboard caps(https://goo.gl/EYwbyo) that go on top of the positive terminal are absolutely necessary if you are not using plastic spacers(ask me how i know). 

tldr: use all the insulation you possibly can.

My personal tip for using the sunnko, bolt it down to the work surface, and use the pedal. This way you can put a LOT more pressure on the probe without killing yourself trying to hold it down, align and weld

To be fair, that pic is filled with mechanical bends which will obviously fracture, reducing the amount of material the power has to flow through, increasing resistance and melting the metal. This thing looks like it was hit by a car. If i saw a pack like that come across my bench its not time to repair it. It's time to bin it with the rest of the cells for hazmat disposal.

This isn't a case for using nickel, its a case for using better enclosures. 

A case for using pure nickel would be cooler operation, higher discharge rates, and longer battery life. Not mechanical strength. Packs aren't meant to be structural and if you expect them to be you have a lot of disappointment ahead. 

Also easy on the bold caps. Your response made my initial draft replies a lot more vicious than usual. It's too early to be editing myself with the expectation of a professional result.

That's exactly what i do. Except without the pedal. At first i was doing the pedal but then i somehow managed to get the pressure right while just holding it and just pushing upwards. OR maybe i just got used to the manual acrobatics. I want a wand.

Did not read every post in this thread but it sounds like you guys are still looking for quality nickel strips. You do know that Nkon also sells nickel strips don't you? Considering their reputation I am confident that they don't sell only plated steel but pure nickel.

I have the 709A, with the wedding pen .010" is the thickest I have been able to use @ 8Pulse when welding across the nickel strip, 6P when welding across the can to nickel strip.

Hey I was wondering if you could clarify your post a bit...

You wrote .010" and .015".  Did you mean .10mm and .15mm?

I ask because .015" is .38mm, which is much thicker than anything I've seen on the market.   Likewise .010" is .25mm, which is available but still very thick, and most spot-welders cannot handle it from what I've read

Speaking of nickel strips, what is the rated Amps for a 10mm wide by .15 thickness strip? I’ve seen so many different values that I don’t know what to trust.

One formula I’ve seen is Surface Area * 19 / 4. For the above strip that is 10*0.15*19/4 = 7.1A only. Yet I’ve seen sellers claiming 40A on 12mm by 0.15mm pure nickel.

Is good, snug fit.
Tape off the end you trim 1st, otherwise the roll will unravel.
You can use KAPTON or regular tape, it didn't really matter for me.
I also wrapped KAPTON tape around the outside prior to the nickel strips being installed as the pack will have some flex with just the tubes being hot glued, after you attach the ni strips, after that the pack will stiffen up really well.

The only downside to using spacers other than having to buy spacers is that you can't build as dense of a unit as you can without them. The upsides are good though. Better ventilation, additional structural strength, easier balance lead management, i'm sure i could think of more.

That's a 709a in that pic. I have one in my drawer. It won't weld anything nearly as thick as 15mil strip with the wand for me. What's the thickness you are using there? I'm about to boost the crap out of that thing so i can use the wand. Somebody gave me some settings to try but it still won't penetrate my strips for a solid weld like the 788H does. It does a great job on the tiny little balance tabs, but i don't use those.

I dont really understand why the pro battery makers (like you @longhairedboy) are still using nickel strips. I know they have proved to work but adding 3-4 layers of them takes way too much time if you do it as your daily job.

I did a quick search on the web and smart alternatives exist. For example: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/9/b9ff6a39f3948df998e1ce45a7083d9474bfdef7.jpg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/b/fb12dcd7e7740fb260cfc37969af2ad9b42d70c0.jpg" width="500" height="500">

Something like this has the following benefits:
1) cell level fuse (maybe @chaka you could be interested too
2)same power capability of 5!!! nickel strips (remember copper is about 4x conductive than nichel)
3) reduced assembly time (as you were just welding 1 strip)
4)super cheap (the listing says about 55yuan/8€ for the one you see in the pics)
5)vibration wont damage the weld (not severely) because of the elastic link

[/quote]

A few reasons, for me anyway. 

* strips allow literally any cell layout you can imagine and don't restrict you to particular stacking patterns. I'm still in the agile phase on most of my processes so this matters a great deal.  
* I'm designing a stamp shape for my 5P trapezoidal stacking pattern that will drastically reduce battery pack time already, so i'm kind of ahead of you on that one.
* custom stamps require tooling costs and bulk orders. Money. 
* I'm famous, not rich, so dev time for shit like this is longer because i always have to hustle and flip other shit just to what i really want. I can't shit money like @onloop does, just not that skilled. Yet. 
* I can't weld copper. Yet. But when i can, i will be switching from nickel to copper. More shit flipping to get my welder modded. 
* time is something i don't have a lot of so sourcing things takes longer in general. ITs hard to google when tiny blonde vikings are demanding burritos and cheese. 
* damping vibration on the whole pack and using a damping agent between cells while providing redundant parallel pathways between cells in each p group also works well.

I just got SUNKKO 709A and tried it for the first time. What's odd is I ordered .15mm strip from 2 different vendors who said it was pure nickel, but one was clearly thicker or stiffer than the other. Both of them, though, won't weld to the battery unless I am using a power of 7 and pulse of 6. My documentation says, too, 4-5 with a pulse of 2 (default), but that doesn't do anything.

Do you find their suggestions to be inaccurate as well?

Ok. I will give that a shot. I did notice I wasn't consistently getting both with the same pressure on the battery so that should help. Thank you. I just had to rip my whole pack a part because the welds were busting off when I tried to flatten the pack.

I'm guessing it doesn't help there's left over nickle from the previous pack I took a part. Is it best to somehow clean the batteries before hand or should that matter?

Yes best to have nice smooth surface, Dremel works great. Also bend the rods outwards so you can get better leverage. Do pull test till you can't remove the nickel without ripping it, if it snaps off it's not good

Thank you! Your suggestions worked perfectly. I cleaned all of the contacts then used the foot switch so I could make certain the pins had a good amount of pressure before attempting to weld. It took a couple trys but ended up at 6.5 with 12P and the welds are perfect. You rip the nickel off and the small dot of nickel stays on the cell.

Awesome. Thanks again

And, I just made it to the bottom of this informative little thread, I wish I had stumbled on it sooner.  

So... Anybody have any pure nickel .2 x 10mm they are willing to part with in the US?  I had no idea sourcing good nickel strips was going to be this big of a PITA.

you'll need about 12ft

30mm per pair, 2 strips per pair, 120 cells = 3600mm or so

to account for mess ups, 15ft should be ok.

send me $15 and your address, i'll have it in the mail tomorrow.

I used two layers of 0.15. My 10s5p pack has close to 1k miles on it so far with zero issues. I am pulling 64 amps quite often when I ride.

I think you should just double up with your 0.20 and you will be more than ok.

why do people do multiple strips instead of folding a single strip?  I see the nickel comes in precut strips and its hard but the copper is very pliable and could fold over for 30mm wide.

Instead of scuffing it up, cut about 5mm off the end of the strip, and toss it in some strong brine for a few days

The cut goes full through it so even it's thick plating it will be detected

I'm just gonna leave this here

@pshaw Evo I built the battery with one layer of 10mm width 0.15 nickel... The one layer spans 8 cells each, or two 4p and a series connection on the 13s pack.

Meaning there's a total of 7 nickel strips in the entire pack(13s) and setup for 50battery amps per esc and 100 motor amps. 

Been running for months. Just my opinion but anything more is overkill unless you are looking for pack rigidity. Which also in my opinion rigidity shouldn't come from electrical connections.

Can one layer of 0.15 transfer the amps? Yes easily. I know it looks like one layer can't do it. But if you consider the resistance over material distance. 10mm wide 0.15 nickel can support a couple hundred amps in short lengths.

I was just reading through this thread and realized I never really gave an update on the NKON nickel strip. So here it is:

The **nickel strips** I got **from NKON** were **for sure pure nickel**. I cut them and left in salt water for days, zero signs of rust. I have had some of the nickel strip on my CGT battery builds for months now. I will be ordering most of my nickel strip though NKON from now on(unless I can wait, then the alibaba link is totally fine) 

Iv'e also thoroughly tested the alibaba pure nickel from the link  i posted above, and it's for sure good stuff.

I wouldn't take this as gospel. Just because his pack hasn't failed doesn't mean that a single layer strip is sufficient. Especially since its unlikely he's drawing 100A continuously from his pack. But that single layer is heating up when drawing at high current. And that heat means that less current is actually delivered to the esc. People have actually done tests at endless-sphere on nickel strips to determine their ampacity. There's a reason why a lot of people are trying to spot weld copper - if a single 0.15mm nickle strip (at 1/4 the ampacity of copper) were sufficient, why would anyone consider copper?

Arrggghhh - It is so frustrating, I bought "pure" strips from ebay (FAKE) and AliExp (FAKE) - both just plated steel. See photo of he grind and salt water test. All advertised as pure Nickel. 

Note you can also see in the photo some strips from NKON.NL, Genuine - but too thick for my welder. Great source for batteries. Reasonable shipping costs too. 

I really want some 0.2x12mm but hard to find without buying a kg and hoping it's not fake.

Hi Pjotr47 - Thanks for the links, have you bought and tested off this supplier? Form their explanations they sound legit. Thx

PS - both sellers I bought from claimed solid and were not cheap.

@Fiori
Thanks. no NKON was 100% legit, I also got batteries from them. A+, great to deal with. As per my description "NKON.NL, Genuine - but too thick for my welder". It was the AliExp and eBay samples that were fake. I'll reword to make clearer. Thanks for the Link, did you grind/rust test?   Thx

@Silverline 
That's the table I have been working from. Looking at 0.2x8mm Nickel it states 6.4A which seems to be the same as many other tables. I note most battery builders complexity undersize their nickel as they don't fully consider current path. Here is a fantastic video that explains that.

Hate to bump up an old topic, but the chart @Silverline shared does not match up with the current ratings listed in the ebay auctions @pjotr47 shared. Does that mean the chart column for nickel is actually nickel plated steel?

Want to know if 10x0.15mm pure nickel is only good for 6A, or >30A. (:crossed_fingers: that I don't need to use copper just to get the max out of my cells lol)

That chart is real. Made by the great matador.
He knows this shit. It's calculated per meter though. Small strips welded on cells have a different behaviour. If you take a look at any commercial pack you will see they use 0.15 plated nickel and it works fine.
I use these numbers for welded strips:

0.1 width 5mm - 5A

0.1 Width 6mm - 7A

0.1  Width 8mm - 10A

0.15 Width 5mm - 10A

0.15  Width 8mm - 15A

0.2  Width 8mm - 20A

0.2  width 25mm - 60A

If you use those settings on bare strips they most likely will glow and burn. The heat of short pieces on steel will not get that hot.
I use only 0.2 with at least one strip per cell for series.
```

How do the physics change for short strips? Shouldn't the heat be the same per length?

Btw, is there a chart somewhere showing the amount of energy / 3s current needed to weld different thicknesses of nickel and copper? Would love to know how beefy of a lipo + spotwelder I need for connections worthy of 30A :slight_smile:

Back in another era Edison and Tesla had a big quarrel about ac or dc. Both lose a lot of power in the transport but ac proved to be more efficient. 
The longer the wire the more power you waste on heat. Aside from that they are in direct contact with the steel of the cells so short strips of nickel do not get as hot as long strips on thin air.
I don't know what you mean with your second question
```

I know you lose more power, but you lose the same amount of power per length of wire / nickel strip, so I would expect temperatures to be the same for a given amount of current.

Second question was me asking what parameters you use to weld different metal combinations, so that I know how many ms on a regular spot-welder / how many joules for the Kwelder I'd need to use. Just so that I don't need to waste time experimenting on my own.

I shorted a 4p pack made with 10mm x 0.15mm strips connected in an Eboosted style, yep, don’t ask.  

Interestingly, although the nickel melted and welded where it came into contact with the steel that shorted it, all the battery weld connections, the rest of the nickel, and all the nickel to nickel connections were fine.  

Not sure how many amps that was, maybe somewhere between 60A and 240A, I’m guessing.  

I’m not drawing any conclusions, just thought it was interesting.

Want to apologize – I just read in another thread about how the direct contact with the cells and the PCB cools down the nickel, allowing it to handle more current. Now that I re-read your response, that's exactly what you said :persevere:
