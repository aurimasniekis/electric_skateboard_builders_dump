Hello, 

Some time ago I purchased this BMS with no actual way to mount an E switch but there are a few solder testing points on it that I suspect may have the possibility to shut down or turn the battery back on does any body know or have any experience with it?

Here is the BMS I Bought:

I bought this bms a while ago, when I was testing few of them.
If you bought the one with temperature switch (the white probe connected by 2 wires), then adding a switch is very simple:
The bms will enter "alert mode"/ will shut off the power, when current does not flow through the temp. switch. 
So you have to place your on/off switch in the way it shorts just one of the two white wires connected to the temp. switch.

Yes I mentioned it but is there any other way because that feature seems to have broken....
