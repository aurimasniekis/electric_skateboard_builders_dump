Have anyone tried to dump the excess energy of regenerative breaking into a peltier cell? I mean, when the battery is full the bms will cut the charging and the esc will have no place to send the power, and you lose brakes in downhill..

A braking resistor is designed for this application.

mmm thanks, i didnt know about those (seems that they are not implemented much in diy builds) .  Still, peltier cells of high wattage seems cheap and will have the advantage of moving some heat out of the enclosure (with proper contact to a external heatsink shield)
