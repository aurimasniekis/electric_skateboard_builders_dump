but how important is a bms!?   With the 2 cutoffs on the vesc, and a bulk charger like for a laptop or hoverboard.... If only there's a simple way to monitor 18650 individually every once in awhile and maybe even keep to 4.15 or even 4.1...as long as the pack is big enough and u don't need every dribble in the battery

Need to find a good simple single cell monitor and discharger like a clamp on light bulb that shows voltage. Like they sell for lipo.  Bike medic or I like the 3 in 1 version.
