this no doubt has been covered before but i was wondering how the skate board specific controllers vary over the standard escs from somewhere like hobby king. 

is there a setting to control the speed of deceleration so you don't just fly off the board as it comes to a sudden regen stop if you take your finger off the trigger.

If you're wondering how the VESC behaves, as a default it just goes to neutral and coasts when you let go of the trigger assuming it's calibrated correctly.
