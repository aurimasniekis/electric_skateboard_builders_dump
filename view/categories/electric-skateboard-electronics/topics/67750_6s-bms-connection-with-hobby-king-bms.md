Hey I'm about to hook up my bms for charging purposes and want to make sure I do it right. I am using two 3s lipos in series. Also would you recommend soldering or just putting the wires into connectors and hot gluing. I also plan on using 10 gauge wire to attach directly to the p- b- and positive charging input. is this correct?
