I just received 2 4s 5000mah turnigy lipo batteries. Should I charge them first before using them, or use them first? I'd like to use one for motor detection for my sk3 motor and enertion vesc. Will this be too much current?

Thanks in advance everyone!

Use the battery meter. If they show less than 4.1 and are relatively even across the board, charge them.

New Lipos come with only a storage charge on them so you should charge them before using them or you might accidentally over discharge and ruin them.
The Vesc motor current during motor detection is controlled by the BLDC tool and is by default limited to 6 amps
