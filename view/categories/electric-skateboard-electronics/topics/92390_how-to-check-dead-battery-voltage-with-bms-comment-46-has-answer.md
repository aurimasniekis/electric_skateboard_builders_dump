Okay, so I haven‚Äôt used the battery in awhile but was planning on selling it to a friend so I went and looked at it and realized it was ‚Äúbricked‚Äù I think.... here‚Äôs a pic of it, I tried charging it but nothing happens. Anyone know what‚Äôs wrong/how to fix? ![image|375x500](upload://osLX4bDPqdxrlgvHUmBKdSWExYf.jpeg)

Get a volt meter and test to see if u have a voltage reading from the charging cable's barrel connector when plugged in to a outlet. 

Also, check to see what the voltage of the battery is. The pack might have over-drained due to lack of use.

Did you store it fully charged? That's the main reason batteries go dead after some time

Just to be clear, never stick voltmeter prongs in a charge port.  NEVER.

(I don't think that was suggested, but I want that to be clear :slight_smile: )

@Eboosted Battery was at 50% which I was told was a good storage charge.

@b264 Definitely getting a volt meter to test later this week or next

Just to make it clear, you are talking about the red circled one?

Haven‚Äôt had any issues yet doing it with the blue circled one. Just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs recommended to do though lol

I should probably add something helpful too. üòÅ

From my expirence, a dead battery after it has been sitting idle for a season can be caused by the BMS powering its circuit from the 2nd cell in series. One of the main reasons I only use balance boards or no bms at all on my builds now. But I still wouldn't go without a bms on a small pack.

Ussually, if the cell has not been drained too low it can be revived by charging the cell individually.

If you did that you would need a piano type switch to disconnect the balance wires from the BMS too.

It would be cool if we all standardized an aux port with pinouts to diagnose and charge individual p groups. Then we could use a hobby charger or other DIY methods involving a lab power supply to bring a pack into balance without removing an enclosure. This would also allow us to bottom balance a pack if we wanted.

Surely the BMS cannot drain if the switch is between the BMS and the - pole of the battery?

You can drain individual cells via the balance wires. I have had BMS's fail and drain a single p group before.

Remember to swap the batteries if it‚Äôs really old or have been siting for a long time because some people have experienced incorrect voltages caused by that.

I honestly got no idea, but pretty sure 3V is the lowest a cell should be discharged to. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs recommenced though. So 36V would be my guess.

Remember to measure all the voltages of each individual p-group. Remember when measuring B1 you need to put the negative prong on the B- part of the BMS and the positive prong on the first balance connector spot. Afterwards it‚Äôs just measuring from the balance connector. BE CAREFUL!!!

I salvaged 18650s from laptop batteries for my first few builds. If they still show a voltage they can be revived. Anything below 2.5 volts and they need to be trickle charged back to 2.5 volts and then they can be charged at 1c, ussually around 2 amps.

These packs are still in service after 3 years of use.

No, I use a fused charge port but you need to check your balance connector to be sure everything is staying balanced. In the RC world this is standard practice but most rc pilots get into the technical side pretty deep. Most eboard riders want nothing to with all that. They just want "plug and play" so a bms is still the best option for the masses.

Alright so just for checking and being serious these are what I should/how I should check the voltage

Stick voltmeter into the CHARGERS connector, the one that @legend27 circled blue.

Then, stick voltmeter into the XT90 connector in the battery or is there another way to do this part...

It's nearly impossible to do so without causing a short.  It's like the old "Operation" game except the consequence of a short is much worse than a red light and buzzer.

I'll be honest, not much can be gained by checking the total voltage. If you can get access to the balance connector then you can check each p group individually.

Alright so to check the balance boards voltage for each p group it would be a prong on the one numbered B and so on adding the voltages together correct?

I check the first cell in series by probing the battery neg and the first pin on the balance harness. Your bms may be different.
![20190502_163255|406x500](upload://251liJ8UB2fw6UegWCdAkZEfV3q.jpeg) 

The next cells can be checked by keeping the neg probe on the battery negative and adding voltages or you can probe eack p group individually like this.

In my case, I didn't even make contact with anything, the probe being close was enough for the spark to air gap and blow up.

But a 2mm gap should require about 5000v to run the gap afaik, if you live in a wet hot humid environment maybe less. Maybe the socket is faulty
