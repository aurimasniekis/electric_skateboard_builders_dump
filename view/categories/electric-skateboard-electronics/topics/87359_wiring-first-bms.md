Hey so I'm wiring up my first charge only BMS and I want to make sure I'm doing this correctly.

Does this (simplified) diagram make sense? I've done plenty of reading and tutorial watching but I figured i would start a thread just in case I end up having any issues. 

My BMS is one of the ones with 11 balance cables (first one being B-) so I don't think a cable to B- is necessary since they connect internally

That's not a guarantee, some BMS's have separate balance boards and current protection circuits. Just connect it anyways.

What's your battery and your BMS?

I can connect one anyways. But I can physically see the internal connection.

Battery is a 10s3p NESE I put together with 30q cells. BMS was bought from another member on this forum used.

What's that mark on the bms?ðŸ¤” It looks like it's on the shrinkwrap?

There's plastic over top of it, looks like something hot got on it. 

The user I purchased it from said it was fully functioning and it looks to be in good shape

That would do it. I was doubtful it was anything serious like water as it was on the top. 

Sorry I can't contribute, I know nothing of connecting bms sðŸ˜‚

So I've got everything for the charge port connected. This all seems to make sense.

The ring terminals will connect to the battery

Well she's charging and no smoke or fires or crackling or anything bad, so good news ðŸ¤˜

I almost caused a fire with my first bms attempt.    You did a good job.

very happy everything seems to be going well! Pack is at 40.7 volts right now. as long as charger stops at 42v and the BMS does its job, i just need to clean up wiring, and tape it up

So as the pack hit 42v the charger stayed red and continued to charge the pack. The BMS started to get warm. Checking some P groups started to reach 4.21 - 4.22v

I would assume this is dangerous yeah? I unplugged the charger. Maybe time for a different BMS....

On this BMS, one of the LEDs does not light up when fully charged... When I check the voltage of each P group, all are at 4.20v except for the one for that specific group which is at 4.22v

I'm assuming this is cause for concern?
