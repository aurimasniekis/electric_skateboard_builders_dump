ii) wheel pulley

questions:

1) which pulley is better (or works) with the wheels listed? 

2) would it work if i used the battery box/holder to make a 10s3p? how would i do it? solder to one another? (i already planned out how to set it so it doesn't fall so no worries there.. and im planning to replace the tiny wires with 12awg copper wires to reinforce... if thats enough)

3) how would i connect the battery indicator? to what? vesc or bms? 

4) does the bms work with this build? its 36v but IDK

5) what to do with the anti spark and power button? 

6) your best 10s3p configurations for this build?

7) what are the best back lights, front lights you would recommend? how do you connect them?
