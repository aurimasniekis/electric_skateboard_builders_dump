According to the datasheet the typical capacity for each cell is 2750mah. Since it is in a 3p or 3 parallel configurationit should be around 8250mah.

Federal aviation only allows 100WH for a lithium battery pack. Can a Yuneec ego be checked in??

I think the battery is 7S.

25.9 volts at nominal x 7.8 = 202.02 wh

It may be 8S though...
