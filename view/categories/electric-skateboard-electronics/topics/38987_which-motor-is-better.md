I want to build a budget board and don't know which motor to pick. These are the two I want to choose between:

And:

Which motor is better (so more torque/speed etc.)??
With the 5065 motor I can make a dual motor set up.

The second will give you more speed but the first will give more torque but only in a dual setup. Otherwise the second will give more torque in a single setup

Do you want to start from a stand still? if so, get a sensored motor.

So if I use this motor:

in dual setup I reach higher torque than the second motor and more speed than the first motor in dual?

Well yes, but remember you will then need two escs and two pulley sets. Unless you have big hills a single of the large motor will be plenty

Make sure you can fit those on the trucks you get. most people use 6355 when going dual. With my dual 6355 I have 10mm max between my motors. I run 15mm belts though so if you go 9mm or 12mm you might be able to squeeze it.

Yep that is also something to remember as well as that your your wheels take up about 15mm each (can't quite remember) as they extend outwards from the bearings

Y not the sensor 6068 motor?   I have both racerstar sensor 6068 and 5065 200kv.   My 5065 200kv are dual with with back and front rear set up.   <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/d/dd79953ac6a3529f92c984ecda670e6059063319.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/3/635f0321a8487097fcce056fde2d45b700ef20f7.jpg" width="374" height="500">
