I bought a 2.4ghz num chuck controller from scramboards. I did not get a manual with it. Can anybody tell me the pairing process with the receiver?

PS. Thank you to everyone for your posts. This community has helped me at every crossroads with my build.

Just be careful of those front buttons. They're a little fragile.
