Facts
1. It's for a Trampa Hs11 deck with Ultimate trucks
2. I'll use Samsung 30Q cells
3. 6374 190kv dual motors
4. 90% Street 10% offroad (not full EMTB)
5. 15/66T pulley set
6. 8" tires

Pros 10s5p
1. 100A of continuous discharge available (50A each motor)
2. More range than 12s4p (not sure about it)
3. More acceleration against 12s4p (not sure about it)

Pros 12s4p
1. The acceleration from medium to top end is impressive and extremely fun on my previous build
2. Range is also increased on the 12s4p vs 10s4p
3. 2 cells less weight
4. Top speed is impressive

If you want to actually pull high current I think higher voltage setup is the way to go. Generally speaking 10s is cheaper/easier to deal with than 12s

10S5P

More range, more current, not as far over safe vesc ratings, more BMS options, more charger options

According to mooch, they are a pretty good cell for 20A.

Yeah, that's a solid consideration, too bad there not much space underneath the board for a 12s5p.

I'll keep the 12s4p I've been riding on my previous boards

I'm sure his findings are reasonable, I'm just not the type to push my batteries past what the manufacturer has rated them. I'd prefer to keep as many cycles as I can get out of my cells and also keep the fire hazard at a minimum. 

But I can also understand those who want to live on the edge :P

He won't be pulling the max current out of them anyway, at least not continuously 20a is what I use for my 10s4p pack as well.

Yeah. I understand you bro!

However the mooch test show only 83C (very safe) after discharging at 20A continuous vs 77C of the 25R.

I had my oldest board with more than a year of continuous use and the battery is holding the charge exactly the same as day one, well maybe not the same, but nothing I can detect without instruments, so I think we should be less concerned about longevity and more about having a blast riding our boards at their fullest 20A per cell! üòé

ooo I can just fit 12s5p in this thing if I can snip that white plug off the unboxed-focobx beside the phase wires.  If I were to dremel it down slowly but not cut into the board you think that would be ok?  sounds ridiculous but wait till you see this!  using all copper sheet connections since the wires take up space.  even have to cut down my xt90 plug.  it all will just fit...but that one white plug.  I'll post up a pic soon.  fantastic.  really syched to do all copper foil welded pack and then the foil replacing the phase wires, rolled up where it needs to be.

Go with 10s since they are more optimized and safer for vesc. And you get less voltage sag. ü§ì

maybe that works.  less sag.  butt rider has good ideas.  more overall amp draw from the cells but now 5 instead of the 4 to deal with that draw
but 12s5p wins for sure!!  juuuust will fit   problem solved wheres that solution button.  damn I cant post questions and then award myself solutions

You pull more amp per cell in 12s4p. Let‚Äôs say you are using 100watts, in 10s5p you pull 2 watts per cell, in 12s4p you pull 2.083 watts per cell, the change is very little indeed.

It's the Vesc which has a max voltage of 60v, 12s(50.4 when full) is on the edge of safety. 10s (42v full) is just the optimal range for Vesc's voltage rating and speed. Any 's' by themselves is not applicable to opitmizatoin. I read this somewhere on the forum, can't remember exactly.

12s is kinda pushing the limits on a lot of the components on the vesc, most of the limits are 60v. you gotta leave a lot of head room, these components just about are as touchy as teenage girls

Fyi, the reason 12s is risky is because if the ERPM limit and the most commonly used motors, eg. 190kv will go above 60k ERPM and burn up the DVR. 

If you can manage the ERPM limit with lower kv.motors 12s is fine.

optimized means "make the best or most effective use of," sweet spot means "the point or area on a bat, club, or racket at which it makes most effective contact with the ball" so saying sweet spot on a Vesc makes less sense.

Redo your calculation; @the same power you need less amps if your voltage is higher.

Since Joule'effect (power dissipated into heat) is a function of the amps and not the voltage, higher voltage lets you squeeze more power thought the conductor with less thermal losses. So in general 12s is better.

But 50 cells (10s5p) have more energy than 48 (12s4p) and most likely the energy lost with lower voltage is well compensated by the 2 extra cells. So I'd say the 2 batteries are pretty much the same.

Dude, your terminology is incorrect therefore your premise is unclear. I'm not having a dig at you but you need to learn more and get comfortable with math in use with the VESC, series voltage and erpm, etc. before offering advice. 

Specifically offering advice to @Hummie, who has built a couple hundred boards, runs an esk8 company and manufacturers arguably the best hub motors available.

also the vesc doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake the best of most efficient use of‚Äù 10s...

your efficiency can be the same or greater with 6s, 7s, 8s, 9s, 11s, or 12s

10s is generally just a good balance of torque and speed for most people.

You have to choose the same voltage per cell if you are calculating like this. Not 3.6 volt per cell for the 10s pack and 4.0 volt for the 12s pack. So in summery you get for the 10s pack when using 4 volts a cell for both 40v √ó 2.5a =100w and therefore 0.5A per cell on a 10s5p. The 5p configuration is a due to the two added cells a bit more gentle on each cell even though it is very little. And btw you just spread wrong information too...
