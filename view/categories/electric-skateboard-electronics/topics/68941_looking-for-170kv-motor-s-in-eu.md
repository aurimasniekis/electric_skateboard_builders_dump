I have two 190kV sealed motors from eskating.eu
If you donâ€™t plan to go crazy off-road I think itâ€™s still ok. Most 190kV motors anyhow just 170-180kV.
If you need a great torque than look for unik boards. They have great sealed 130 and 150kV motors.
Or check hobbyking, but I donâ€™t know if they have the motors on stock

Yeah the ones from eskating I wanted to take, too. But the thing is I want to go crazy offroad :D.
So maybe I should look for 130 - 150 ones :) I think the ones unik boards have are perfect! :)

You can calculate your max speed here
http://calc.esk8.today/advanced/
If it is still enough with 150kv than go with the ones from unik.
I think they nearly the same like from eskating.eu besides the different kV

Somewhat off topic question here...Iâ€™m using two 190kv motors with TB Vesc. By my calculations the erpm is 67 000, but with the calculator it says 59 000...which do I trust?

I think the calculator is good but at the end it makes no difference cause of the rpm limit if iam not wrong
```

Someone made a backorder from unik? I asked them hopefully it wont take that long :33

EDIT: Several weeks :3

Loaded or unloaded?

With my last build I made calculation with this one
http://calc.esk8.it/
And it was close to be exactly what I got in the end on the street.

You can ask @okp about backorder time.
He should know.

Yes @Andy87 I used the same one, it gave me 59 000 erpm should I go with that and still limit the erpm to 60 000?
```

If you have a vesc/focbox under hw 6 than I would always set it.
Better safe than sorry and if your max is 59000 it anyhow will not affect you.
