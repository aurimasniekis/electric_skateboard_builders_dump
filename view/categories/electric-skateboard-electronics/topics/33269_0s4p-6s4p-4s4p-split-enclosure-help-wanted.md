Ok helping myself :slight_smile:
 
Beef up the series connections as outlined in this in this thread, I have a shitty BMS for it only at this time so bypass the discharge.

The diagram helps and I can split after the first 6s and just have some 12awg run to the next pod, soldered on some wire to the balance port pins as this did not come with a set of balance wires from banggood.
