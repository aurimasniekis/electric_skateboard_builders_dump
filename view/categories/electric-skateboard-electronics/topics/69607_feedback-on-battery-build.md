Hey guys, I'm looking for feedback on my first li-ion battery build.
It's a 10S3P using Sony VTC6 cells.
Using a SU Power 60A BMS.

Also I was very happy with my spot welder! I first messed around with a Sunkko but that thing sucks. Bad welds, blowing out the house breakers.
Now using a K Weld. That thing is insane! Works so well. ( https://youtu.be/Z0j17LVNm3s )

I have thought of a few points of improvement myself already.
- Cutting away the corners on the positive tab to keep the sharp corner from poking into the negative part and causing a short.
- Cleaning up the balance wires to keep them from rubbing.

Fishpaper under the balance wires.
The bms just sitting on the cells or there is some isolation inbetween?

Double-sided foam tape under the BMS. Did I do well? ;) Haha

You mean between the packs, here?

I used double-sided foam tape.
Haven't used fish paper anywhere. Wasn't aware of it's existence and use. :slight_smile:

```
Foam can get cut due to vibrations over time.
Better use a sheet of fishpaper under the foam.
