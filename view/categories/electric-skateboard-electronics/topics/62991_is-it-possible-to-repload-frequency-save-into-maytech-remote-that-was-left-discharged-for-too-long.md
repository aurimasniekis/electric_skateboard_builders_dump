Hi forum

I hve a Maytech/Steez remote that was left without use for at least a year and the battery got depleted. Maytech warned against leaving it without a charge for  longer than 3 months saying the frequency save will get deleted in the remote, and thus you wouldn't be able to connect it anymore. 

I'm not getting blinky channel light indicators following the [manual](http://www.michobby.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Maytech-Users-Manual-for-Remote_V2.1_English-Version.pdf)

Does anyone know whether I could access the remote somehow and check this?

Thanks!
