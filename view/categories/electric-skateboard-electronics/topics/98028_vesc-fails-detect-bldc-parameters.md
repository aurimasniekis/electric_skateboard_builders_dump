I had this board running for a few days then on my way home some soldering broke with cables I made to extend the distance from vesc to motor. Now I cant get it to work even when vesc is straight up connected to the motor. Checked motor phase wires and it seems fine. What can I possibly do?

Figured i'd see what foc has to say. Btw, I dont have any idea what flashing means so when trying to google help, lingo i dont know doesnt help.
