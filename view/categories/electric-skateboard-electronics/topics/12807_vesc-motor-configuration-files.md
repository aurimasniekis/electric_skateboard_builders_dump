Short Story. I bought a VESC 4.7 from a few year ago and did not do much for hitting so many road blocks to finish my eboard. I am at the stage where my VESC has updated firmware while keeping version 4.7 and the bootloader. Right now I have to deal with motor configuration. From what I remembered a past version of the BLDC Tool had the configuration files but I can no longer find the source of said files. Do I attach motor and hit the calibration button or go and find files?

Motor to be in use is the SK3-6374.

You don't need that, read the tutorials here in the forums. All you have to do motor wise is autodetection.
