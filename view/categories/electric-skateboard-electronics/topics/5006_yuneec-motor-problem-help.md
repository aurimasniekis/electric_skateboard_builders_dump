Hello all

I have a Yuneec the old model. i am going to upgrade it with a new VESC - Motor Controller 
but.. i haven't got it yet 

When i am driving my motor got so hot that it shut the board off. ,, the first time it happened there came smoke out the motor,,, so i need to know if i need to buy a new motor now as well, or there are a way to fix it?

when i have disabled every part ,, and re-plug the power to the original vesc the board turn on and everything worked again, but still the motor gets totally burning hot when driving like 2 km and shuts everything off again and same storry,,, Whats happening?.. I am going to bug test some more when it cools down . 

The vesc and battery is not hot at all.

(I think i maybe have plunged the cable from the vesc to motor wrong in, but if thats was the case it have worked like a long time)

Any help i can get will be helpful, i am new to E-skateboards
thx

If there is smoke there is a short on the winding. Get a new motor. I have a yuneec motor and wish to replace it but i think the mounting bolt pattern is not standard. Yuneec measures 24mm center to center and standard is 20mm apparently.

If it is breaking when unplugged there is definitely a short.

It means the insulatoin of two of the phases had bekcme damaged and they make contact where they should not.

I think it is not fixable(You could rewind the motor but that is not really an option).

Interesting concept, increasing the magnetic fiels by just attaching a magnet on the can. However this won't work on outrunnera as the can itself rotates and the stator is on the inside.
