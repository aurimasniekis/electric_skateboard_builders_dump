So through careful testing by touching an LED to various locations, Iâ€™ve determined this small device is not functioning. I would assume it is a bms/protection circuit for the battery. Does anyone know any solutions to fixing/replacing this? It is on an enertion steez remote.

Have you tried testing the battery terminals directly?

Yes. Battery internals into it are powered. Connections into the pcb are powered.

Found the fix: [1s protection circuit](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/OOTDTY-3-7V-4-2V-3A-Li-ion-Lithium-Battery-Charger-Protection-Board-For-18650-TP4056/32831437488.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.7RgIqg)

I may try out using a 18650 inside the remote as well if it fits.
