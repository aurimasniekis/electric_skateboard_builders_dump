So I'm thinking this might be my final layout (12s6p). And I'm going to do a 2 stack and looking for tips and trick for building the pack. It'll be for an evo so no flex deck so that should make things easier. 

I've been looking at examples lately of people who have just used solid nickel sheets. Seems like you can use less thickness and it would be an easer process. Anyone know where to source this that is pure nickel? How do i figure out where to tack with the spot welder?

Any tips tricks would be awesome for pack construction. 

Thanks!
