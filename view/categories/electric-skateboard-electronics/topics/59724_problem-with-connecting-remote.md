Anyone have expericene in pairing this remote with a 2.4 ghz receiver? Got a new VESC and really can't seem to figure it out.

You can’t just pair any old remote with any receiver, they must be the same brand and type, the same thing happened to me when my Gt2b receiver broke.

By the looks of that remote it is a wowgo/meepo style remote which means it won’t work with any other receivers as the receiver for that remote is built into the main circuit board. Sorry to say but you need another remote, I’d recommend a Gt2b with a case mod
