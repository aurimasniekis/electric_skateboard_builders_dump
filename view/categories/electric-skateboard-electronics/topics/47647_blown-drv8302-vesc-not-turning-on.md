Hi guys,
Is that a blown DRV and does it looks repairable?
VESC does not turn on anymore. I checked it with different wires. And the slave VESC still functions fine.![20180227_212422|690x388](upload://b7xDSuowD2ffExdScEc1fpz0zFx.jpg)

clean it with alcohol, there is lots of dirt around. Looks like there is solder bridging two pins on the DRV in the middle..

If you can¬¥t solder on a new one, try @Martinsp or @fottaz. They both offer Vesc repairs here in the EU.

Thanks for joining.
After a thorough cleaning i can not find any trace of damage. But the VESC still gives no sign of life. The blue light isn¬¥t turning on. I was going over a bump when the VESC died. 
How can i troubleshoot further?
Btw. i am located in Japan, so shipping to EU is a pain.
I read so much warning about the Maytech shit...
Don¬¥t have the money to get better ones at the moment and my board isn¬¥t running F***ing SH*T.

I have not read through the thread but have you checked shorted ppwer lines to ground? The drv does not turn on if any led does not.

The VESC get¬¥s hot when connected to the battery, i can not see any shorted power lines.

That's how the VESC looks after cleaning.![20180227_224656|690x388](upload://1VS1WlXMepG7zsqZM9HJT5bmAJq.jpg)![20180227_224549|690x388](upload://vGHQ7QXsg5FmopUOLwTEcJQ2e00.jpg)![20180227_224633|690x388](upload://qsp4JMfO8nv5JcXZ3e0UnBbWLhq.jpg)

Did you use alcohol? did you give a good 'wash' with it and allow to dry properly? Looks a bit grimy still around the drv8302 chip and maybe usb too

no lights come on with power? no usb discovered on pc?

Yes led is not turning on no detection from usb.
I will try with more alcohol once again. 
Could the dirt be my only problem?

One of my Torqueboards vesc has the same issues. Doesnt turn on, no LEDs, and does not connect to my computer. It also gets hot when turned on. Did you ever figure out what the problem was @goldrabe?

I am not very familiar with VESC layout. Is u401 a component or a does it refer to something plugged into a pin on the vesc?

It is the small 8-legged chip, CAN chip.

Okay, so should I simply remove it and try to power up, or does it need replacing before the VESC will operate? (I don't use CAN at all so if it's not needed to operate I won't replace it)

The VESC can work without it normally except the CAN feature

As Martin said, CAN chip. I've had vescs blow that chip/and shorting the vesc without the user using CAN. I have no clue why, someone smarter might have a idea :wink:

Yes in my case, I shorted the CAN chip with a wrong cable supplied by Maytech themselves.
Martin fixed the VESC for me, i can vouch for his service. But in the end the Maytech VESC'S were of not really good quality and I replaced them with ESCapes from @stewii which work like a charm!

Yeah my next vescs will ESCapes for sure. 

Did the CAN chip break the VESC, or was simply removing it sufficient to get the VESC running again. In other words am I going to need a VESC repair or can I just remove the CAN chip?

I was, or I am using CAN, so Martin replaced the chip for me. But if he says removal is enough to get the VESC running again then i guess it's enough. (sorry, no VESC expert here) Martin's explanation was that the broken CAN chip is shorting the VESC and that is the reason why it can not power on.

Would someone be able to tell where the CAN chip is located on the VESC?

My guess is that this did not come directly from maytech, probably a vendor with access to the back door of the factory 

Even with the drv cleaned up looks like a bad one, probably the can chip if gets hot under power per previous comments

I've ordered my VESC's directly from Maytech and they both had this sticker on it. I think it's a warranty warning like "if this seal is broken your warranty will be invalid". But when I send them messages asking for warranty repair because they supplied the wrong cable i didn't got a single answer anyway. üòÇ

I've never seen an ESC looking like that first picture brand new, it looks like it was dragged through a field backwards
