Hi everyone

It's almost 2019 and it's good time to introduce this repackage option I've been working on for a while.
It took more than I wanted, but the more frequent updates were on [IG](https://www.instagram.com/dosimplecarbon/) 
I love the mini remote, as many of you, but I'm leaning towards thumb control, so this is a version where we take the internals of the mini and put it inside a nice 3d printed enclosure which features thumb control.

I know there have been several versions of the same conversion, and this one is mine.
If nothing else, we have more options now :slight_smile:

Here are the key features:
1. LiPo battery 300/600mAh +charger/balancer board.
2. Simple regulator to convert LiPo output to 3.3v for the main PCB.
3. Using the dial pot from the mini + bearing supported.
4. Full access to mini buttons at all times. 
5. Feels good in the hand (personal opinion)
6. Only 3 3d printed parts, PLA works great for me with 60% infill

I'm almost ready to release the files, and working on the "conversion instructions" now.
Before that, I need help

I'm no authority on esk8 remote ergonomics, so I'm looking to collect feedback. 
I want to send 3-4 kits to people who have the mini and want to do the transition.
I'll include the battery, charging board, regulator and the bearing. You will have to add the mini.

*this is done strictly for improving the design, the files will be then shared freely.

So, what do you think?
Any volunteers?

Thanks,
Dani

Good morning (01.18.19)

Thank you for your support and patience. The .stl files are now available from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3363745), Thing: 3363745


I did several more iterations since the testing phase:

* Added material for stiffer bearing support, and an additional bolt in the throttle area.
* The thumb thingy is now centered, and the on/off switch is easier to access.
* Added two holes for the lanyard.

To overcome the issue from [post 37](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/fish-hook-in-reverse-thumb-option-for-the-mini-remote/79480/37?u=danile), I changed the bolts which connect the two halves together. You will now need five M2.2x10mm self-tapping bolts, [something like this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/304-A2-SS-Phillip-Pan-Head-Tail-Self-tapping-Screws-PB-M2-M2-2-M2-6-M3-M4-M5/172885844120?var=&hash=item2840cca098).

The inner pieces are still using the bolts from the mini ([don’t forget to clip the thumb assembly bolts](https://dosimplecarbon.com/how-to-convert-the-mini-remote-to-thumb-control-for-esk8/))

Now, regarding the parts needed to complete the switch (besides the mini)
All of them are cheap and some of them you probably already have (come on, this is a diy forum :slight_smile: )
That said, they are even cheaper if bought in bulk (~10+pc vs. one by one)

So here is the thing:

I’ve received several DM’s regarding the printed parts and whether I can print them for members.

Because I want this remote to be available to anyone, and I have small quantity of parts available (missing the batteries now), I will be able to sell several kits – everything you need (printed parts + the inside hardware) minus the mini. (I promise bright colors)

DM me if you're interested.

And one last thing:

I really want this to be a living project. Anything you want to add/comment/modify/request please share in this thread or DM me and I’ll do my best to apply.

Enjoy,
Dani

On the blue case?
It was an earlier version, the bolt was too close to the edge, so didn't print as it should.
It's fixed now

A radio n speaker inside too? Be cool to be able to cruise the dial while riding.  Primo speaker n bigger battery.  Or a laser pointer I bet would do a lot for safety.   Can make the laser spot dance at intersections and point out the finer asses.  Humm.  no one is yelling lasers are dangerous.

I might be interested in one. If there's a way to fit a Bluetooth module in there I can probably design a clip-on mechanism so you could attach @janpom 's DAVEga to it.
```

---
## \#18 Posted by: janpom Posted at: 2018-12-31T23:46:39.443Z Reads: 241

```
DAVEga is designed to be plugged directly into a VESC. The bluetooth module would have to have a UART interface and implement the same communication protocol as a VESC for it to work. Plus, it requires 0.5W, so it would drain the remote battery pretty quickly.

No sign up, there are enough people for the first, call it beta test, batch.

Eventually, you'll need to print it, unscrew/screw some bolts and solder some wire.
Simple, daily stuff for this forum.

Initially it had a loop for the finger:
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp-YyoshpnL/

But it wasn't printing it as I wanted, so I opened it, but the curve remained.
There is always an option to put something there as future versions.
One idea was to utilize the second channel as an on/off for skate lights (for example)

So, this is something I became aware of like 15 minutes ago, while writing the manual.

There are two versions of the mini (maybe more) with slightly different bolt sizes (see picture)
The boards inside are the same size and the same locations for the key components.

Smaller bolt size (right on the picture), with bigger resonator crystal on the bottom.
Bigger bolts (left on the the picture), with smaller resonator crystal on the top.

The case was designed for the smaller bolts.
(AFAIK this is the newer version of the mini)

Both boards will fit inside with no problem. 
Bolt size affect only the outer case assembly (4 bolts), bigger head won't fit the recesses.

This is something that can be fixed later, but for now be aware of this.

Here is the "[manual](https://dosimplecarbon.com/how-to-convert-the-mini-remote-to-thumb-control-for-esk8/)".

It is basic and will be expanded in the future, but for now it is out there so everyone could assemble their remotes.

Please feel free to ask any questions

I’m late to the party, great work!

So... you’ve printed at 4 remote shells for me in past, I’ve got your Gt2b in baggy ready to send, then I discovered epoxy resin casting. 

I took your remote Gt2b apart and reshaped it my liking to make a cast for later.  I didn’t use my mod because frankly the first go around was messy and tough to unpack. 

Can I be a tester the second build round if you make them? Just need prints and maybe bearing. I’ll prob pick up several mini’s from @psychotiller when I can get free.

😛 mines together and working lol. 

In no way does this affect functionality but ive notice the thumb wheel sits a little cocked to one side. I think it's more of an print alignment between the two pieces. 

Nontheless, it fits well in the hand. I feel like a Hawaiian surf god or some shit holding it lol. 

@danile I think if you take the top add screw I mentioned and put it more at the apex of the top, you should be fine on clearance inside.

So after a full ride with the remote...

Holding it is comfortable. Although I think it would feel more form fitting if the edges were more rounded. Just my opinion though.

The power switch is just the slightest pain to switch lol. I usually don't have nails so having to push harder to reach the switch. Maybe if he hole was a tad bit wider to be able to squeeze more of your finger tip in.

Throttle is smooth, not catchy or draggy. Again I think its just alignment between the two pieces for the wheel leaning to one side. However it does not affect functionality of the thumb wheel.

Assembly was pretty straight forward. Only issue I had was the screw hole on the hook tip stripped out very easily. Its still holding together though. I'll end up adhering the two pieces together.

As a whole I'm quite happy with it. It preformed as I expected my other Mini to perform, flawlessly.![0108192103c_Film1|375x500](upload://dDfV2ZgmpohoHTGrsE3KgAvnjri.jpeg) ![0108192102_Film1|374x499](upload://96uAZ0lrf660Praxh3GuJ9iXp1W.jpeg) ![0108192103_Film1|375x500](upload://jyMs2loRxckuoYFjV5QKNRERSIO.jpeg) ![0108192103a_Film1|375x500](upload://qLMlsALNEIjBNFfgf5Qat2H8n8B.jpeg) ![0108192103b_Film1|375x500](upload://xU75GO6XnF2Vz0CNx4IITDiO5YO.jpeg) ![0108192102a_Film1|375x500](upload://mqBrCZ6J6VOuQbLdnzI4ISzsxXj.jpeg)

@J0ker3366

Much appreciated your feedback, thank you!
Here is my take from it:
1. Check if possible to round the edges. 
2. Make recess at the on/off switch, make it more accessible.
3. Holes for lanyard (love your choice of color :slight_smile:)
4. Make the hoe diameter smaller, so it won't strip easily.
5. Add two bolts at the apex (as we talked in DM)

For the printed thumb piece. You can slide it further on the pot assembly (rather than leaving it flush with the rod), it was designed to allow this. Then it will be centered.

Did you feel it was slightly on the fat side?

Thanks again,
Dani

Finally got around to building this out. I took pictures of the entire process but need to upload them if anyone needs to see them.

As much as I want to hate this remote (judging by looks only) Its actually surprisingly comfortable.

I do agree with @J0ker3366, placement of the power switch was a bit tough to switch due to not having any nails but I managed. Just took a few swipes at it to get it in place.

I think the remote feels amazing in my hand, I have bigger hands and remotes normally feel weird and are easier to drop. This one, its secure. It fits perfectly in there. I just wish it didn't look like it does! I can get over that though because it went from a comfort level of around 3 with the mini, up to at least a 7 or an 8 with your printed one.

I haven't had any drop outs or reduced abilities from when I just used the mini. Battery seems to last a good amount of time. I logged about 2.5 hours of ride time with it so far and its still has a charge.

I think a good option for the future would be some sort of battery gauge?  Could even just be a few lights just to keep my mind right.

Besides that, I'm excited to see what comes from this project! Thanks for including me in the testing!!

Oh and @J0ker3366...as you can see I got the orange!!! Let me know if you want to trade colors!

Or when I get my printer back up and running, I can print you one in what ever color you want.


I forgot to mention this @danile, the thumb response and the way the trigger glides is really good, but as @J0ker3366, the wheel part is just a bit off to one side, looks like it was printed that way, is there a reason for that?

Eric

Thank you for the response, I'm glad you liked it. 
And yes, I was targeting big hands😀 so very glad it was a success.

I'll check the trigger allingment and see what can be improved.
Battery gauge is doable, maybe something like this

This is amazing! I've been trying to figure out what could be better than the benchwheel (which I love) , maybe this is my answer!! Never had a dropout that I was aware of, but this might be even safer... how much you need for one next round @danile ?

The first round was with batteries that I had for a while, so no idea where I've got them from.
I'm supposed to get batteries this week and then I'll be more comfortable suggest a particular link.

In general, look for LiPo sized 20X30mm, these are typically ~300mAh

Thank you for the interest,

Battery options (following the discussikn several days ago)

I've got the batteries today. These are 20 by 30mm with 4mm thickness lipo cells, with 300mah capacity.
Besides the intended 1cell at the bottom, you can add additional one in parallel, of add smaller ones at the curve😀

With three bolts the pot assembly was too stressed, so the throttle was kinda slow. Think that the bearing and the base were off axis.
I added the stiffening for both the bearing and the base. Removing the bolt helped also, as the case was not driven to this direction.

I left the material in the model and just removed the bolt. It looks good and feels great. The looks are cleaner also.

The components are soldered on one side only. I guess less probability of shortening stuff.

I'll try to make a video or more close up pictures for the reg making (given I'll get the parts in the near future)

**Short instructions on how to build the regulator:**

1. Parts needed:
AMS1117 3.3v voltage regulator
22uF and 0.1uF capacitors
3x4 proto board
I find it easy to cut from larger piece with regular scissors going through the adjacent hole line, then trim
![20190123_131113|666x500](upload://3hIip2TjZS3qEAJ3X4n6Toi0l8o.jpeg) 

2. Put 3 blobs of solder in the third line
![20190123_131236|666x500](upload://cNuEMkhJBgVOpJMUZir3FLD5Qw8.jpeg) 

3. Align the reg and solder the legs. This should be easy due to the prepared blobs
![20190123_131358|666x500](upload://fhYv4mzqDMoAxjTmcsW1IEhdGM2.jpeg) 
![20190123_131446|666x500](upload://ioL1gAmlNvik1VbhiYkNXgdfLRa.jpeg) 

4. Insert the 22uF cap through the holes. Note the ground leg. Then solder the positive leg to the middle hole.
![20190123_131712|666x500](upload://6QiFDUSkihgRF5gPOS4Kj8r6Nie.jpeg) 

5. Insert the smaller cap through holes (you should have two legs in the leftmost hole - ground)![20190123_131741|666x500](upload://bBvkKVHdGJQJrymBaN9L8AOhyY4.jpeg) 

6. Solder the legs to the board
![20190123_131846|666x500](upload://dfpT6m6vcgAac4dakNr0S0nEGSp.jpeg) 
![20190123_131835|666x500](upload://vVZPuKN85eKWFvk8O2wAm4O27nY.jpeg) 

7. Snip the legs short and solder to the regulator
![20190123_131919|666x500](upload://A5UA3QR8wMDfeAY0fw6v3zgFNYD.jpeg) 
![20190123_132016|666x500](upload://nCxJdfRidbe7161sOVYnmMUlY2M.jpeg) 
![20190123_132026|666x500](upload://xXMnu3xgOcwLYnmu7NF4v7e9cQT.jpeg) 

8. Add wires: two (black) to the ground leg and one red to each of the remaining legs
![20190123_132608|666x500](upload://2npLQLlS3wYnLLSmH2m4qGDzCAS.jpeg) 

9. Black+center red go to the mini board. Black + right go to the output from charger board

Hope it helps,
Dani

![20190124_160829|666x500](upload://5FcQUvvSD2z5w36lb6pR6QJbKfb.jpeg)

The mini board is designed to work with 3v (1.5vx2 dry cells)
Max voltage of lipo cell is 4.2v, the regulator protects the mini electronics.

I'm not familiar with your cell, could you check the voltage range: full/empty?

Okay the the lipo I have actually said 3.7v 300mah - I understand the need for the regulator now. 

I've got mine together but it will be awhile before my board is finished to test it.

One thing I can say is finding space for regulator battery and charger board to fit in the bottom of the handle is very snug. I definitely used wires that were too thick. It is together though and it closes. 👍

Nicely done!
I have an idea on how to solve the battery thing, but will take some time to actually do it

Duct tape be because the only part that hasn't come in is the screws 😂 I'm sure I could get the screws to put it together at the hardware store?

yeah, the one issue with this remote is that even when the remote is turned off, the battery continues to drain. Mine is dead after a day of just sitting. This means i will have to charge it before every single ride.

How can we fix this?

You are right. Mine drains after 3 days.
One way to fix this is by using an external switch which will come before the reg. I was too hoocked on using the built it switch that I completely forgot about this. 
The new switch is already ordered, and I will release modified enclosure very soon.

The beauty of product development 😀

An update.

Rearranged things inside to fit the on/off switch.
Now the output voltage from the 1s charger is going through the switch (pos side) and only then to the regulator. So the reg is working only when switched on - no draining.

Also, not using the original switch might be [not so bad idea.](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mini-remote-crappy-switch/21802)

**Apparently there is no space on the forum, so can't upload pics.
There's one @dosimplecarbon on IG

Hey guys

For some reason I can't edit the first post, along with the title, so the update is here:

New files were added to the same [thing:3363745](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3363745/files)
These are easily identified with "switch" in the name.

The main difference would be the added switch to the bottom of the remote. It goes before the regulator, and so overrides the draining problem. The switch is recessed, so no accidental pressing, only intentional. It is also beefier and arguably better than the original flimsy one.

The internals were moved a little bit and the "control panel" moved from one side to the other. 
I believe the cable management is more convenient in the new layout.

The basic shape and the thumb control remained as is.
![20190304_214105|666x500](upload://qII73PmjDV1PiS19QaTXHqKX5m7.jpeg) ![20190304_214111|666x500](upload://jmlbociph2xuXfQxcJSSnsKdSZm.jpeg) ![20190304_214120|666x500](upload://A22Jgyv1y0D4sNQhQve8JZt9YFU.jpeg) 

I will update the assembly manual in a couple of days.
Thank you everyone who contributed to this project.

Feel free to contact me with any question. As before, if you want printed parts with the internals, DM me and I can send you a full kit.

Enjoy,
Dani

Hey guys

I realize I'm waay past due on the update.
But I have a really good reason, my second child was born (a girl) 13 days ago, so naturally everything else shifted back.

I've published a new post with pictures about the switch, check it [here](https://dosimplecarbon.com/fixing-battery-draining-in-fish-hook-remote/)

Was commuting to work during the week with the updated version and there's no draining issues, so go ahead and give it a try.
![20190320_144841|666x500](upload://c3EQZZ97xLZhrqXmFPhf4pcX1xU.jpeg) 

If you want to have the components or the entire kit, please pm me and I'll have it shipped for you.

Also, I have several cases printed of the old version. As @b264 mentioned, it might be used with direct lipo, pm me if you want one of these.

Enjoy,
Dani

Yep, I've been running a Mini Remote on straight lipo voltage (unregulated) for over a year with no issues.  Of course, that doesn't mean you won't have issues.  But I'm relatively certain it's just fine.

Thanks for designing this thumb remote case, its been rock solid and very comfortable. After adding a switch between the charger and regulator the battery life has been great.

Wish I could have gotten mine to work. I figured out that this issue with mine was a broken cold solder joint on the potentiator. Maybe I will try to reassemble in the future. I think I would like it better than my current mini remote
