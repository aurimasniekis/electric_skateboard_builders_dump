Hi all,

Hi :slight_smile:

If these are 3s batteries you can use a 3s to 6s balance adapter and charge of that one as a 6s Battery

What you search is this:

Just parralel each balance wire with the same one on the other pack.

But, just to have it said, it is not the bes idea to charge LiPos in parralel

Personally I prefer to charge my Lipos individually, outside of the enclosure on my board.  That way you can inspect the batteries after each ride (for safety) and then charging, in my eyes, is going to be more consistent as the charger is focusing on one set of cells (1 battery).  That said, you can buy parallel charging boards from eBay.
