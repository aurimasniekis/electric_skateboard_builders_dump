Alright so I just setup my focbox unity, but my motor is making kinda weird noises. Maybe I'm paranoid, but if someone could tell me if this is normal, I'd appreciate it. Thanks!

The motor spins fine after startup, its just the initial part of the spin that has a weird ticking noise.

the little click before it spins? yeah i think so...i dont know the proper terminology but mine does the same...i assume its the activation of the magnet field that is about to start the motor spinning.
