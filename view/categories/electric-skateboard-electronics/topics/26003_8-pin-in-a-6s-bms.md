Hi Guys, I bought a Bms from Alien (Bestech but rebranded) and saw that there is 8 pins not 7 and I have a 6s battery, what do I do?

It also came with this factory problem, should I worry?

No need to create a second topic ;)

I Don't think that is a Bestech. 
A Bestech 6s bms should only have 6 pins
I searched that part number on Bestech website and there where no results.

@rpn314 @Namasaki 

 Hi guys, first I would like to say that Alien annouce a different BMS from the one that they sell and I wired it like the one in their site. Let's continue, the Bms in the question is a PCM-L16S50-985, that works for 6-16S and I wired it like the Bestech one, unless for the balance cable that I adapted the one that came with the board for 6s (Picture 1). Fine, I connected the balancing cables and then plugged my battery and a big spark happened and started smelling like the BMS was burned, It burned my XT-60 and now I'm lost, I want my money back!

The Bms have it self 5 pins, two P-, Two B- and one CH-

From the picture you posted above it wants you to put the first balance wire on B- them all of the normal balance pins, and then B+. Totals 8pins which is what you have

Se mandaram o BMS errado, manda um email e não mexe com este. Relaxe e espere. Pare de mexer até que eles falam o que deve fazer. Se mexer, pelo menos um parte da culpa é sua.

Vamos praticar o português, o que realmente aconteceu, o Bruno além de declarar o valor errado e fazer eu pagar uma multa de 1200 reais mandou o BMS errado e esqueceu de uma parte do Motor Mount. Eu fiz como vocês mandaram, mas percebi que havia oito pinos, mas no plug que veio com o BMS havia um pino não usando, ai pensei q era pra não usar e fiz o adaptador e conectei tudo certo.
 Fui fazer o teste de passagem de corrente, sem plugar o BMS ao Carregador, e Parece que um curto foi causado e um filamento se desgrudou do BMS, ou seja, o Bms veio sem configuração alguma e ainda veio com o plug errado, pois para mim o Positivo sempre é o primeiro no cabo de balanceamento. A culpa não é minha e já recorri com a Alien, mas ele entraram em recesso (Recess) e irão demorar para me responder, só quero meu dinheiro de volta para comprar o IMAX B6. Gostaria de algum site para reclamações internacionais, teria algum?

Yeah, I'd say it's fried. Having never really seen that BMS, my guess is that's a communication or ground wire between the upper and lower boards, and it's been completely fried. I suspect your batteries shorted something inside the BMS. Frankly, you're probably lucky that friend and that your batteries didn't explode!

I have the same BMS I think! I talked to Bruno and he said that since the 7s and 6s BMS that they sell are built using the same board they basically only disable the last battery cell or something (hence the missing cable). Even with this explanation I am no closer to figuring out how to not blow this up... I asked him for a diagram showing how to wire up but says that instructions were included in the box.. I did not see any instructions so I need help setting this up. Have anybody of you guys had experience with this BMS http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/batteries/6s-batteries/battery-bms-with-switch-for-6s-lipo-battery/ before? Can someone make a diagram of how I should wire it up?

PCM-L16S50-985 is what it says on the board but on the website it says HCX-D223.. The last model number mentioned I believe is for http://bestechpower.com/222v6spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html . For the model number on the actual bms I have only found it here http://www.globalsources.com/si/AS/Shenzhen-SmarTEC/6008834599030/pdtl/Li-ion-batteries-BMS/1125748517.htm Hope this helps..

Yeah I agree! If they have given me the wrong bms I will be very disappointed.. I will still test it out but I am going to need an expert opinion on the wiring diagram :P I am done with it in 45 min :) The way I see it the following should work if I just want to see if doesnt blow up my battery:
1. B- to B- on bms
2. CH- to charger plug (negative pole)
3. B+ connected to charger plug (positive pole)
4. Treat the 7 wires going into the balance connector as follows:
4a. left most wire B-
4b. first wire on the right side (next to the cut wire) gets B1
4c. then B2
4d. then B3
4e. then B4
4f.  then B5
4g. then B6

Btw where did you get that pdf that you linked from?

I have now finished my wiring diagram draft for this mysterious BMS. I would really appreciate if you guys could check it out and say if I have done something wrong. The only thing that can seem weird is that the BMS has 8 pins and the second pin on the balance cable that came with the BMS does not have a cable attached. You will see this illustrated by there being nothing connected to it :P .<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/b/abf5c0c91b70b742b0ea39613bb5b18cf32a51f7.png" width="690" height="387">

That is too bad :\ There are some markings on the pcb. The far right pin of the balance cable is marked as B- after that the next pin is marked B1 then B2 all the way up to B16.

You can see that there is a pair of 3 101Resistors, so 6 cells, but I do not know why there is a blank space between them, this Bms os from 6s to 16s, so it's not a specific Bms for 6s batteries, I is freaking generic, I do not burned my house because I used xt60 to connect the Battery to the Bms and xt60's from the Bms to the Power Switch, if I did soldered my battery would enter in short and catch on fire, I really recomend to send it back to Bruno (I didn't do it because sending things to Outside of Brazil is fucking expensive) request your money back and buy some in Bestech or buy a battery pack.

in this picture it looks like the B- on the balance block is not used. and the first pin in the connector is B1
It's hard to tell for sure without holding the module in my hand and looking at it from just the right angle.
It does look like the block is not in line with the B-

You might be right. I have sent my wiring diagram to APS and asked them to verify if my logic is correct. As I have never wired two lipos in series before I would like to get some feedback on if the balance wires are correct as well as the series connection itself. What do you think?

Okay at least that is some good news! So IsTalo and I got the exact same balance cable with the BMS where the second pin to the left has no cable attached. Given that we got the same cable with the same number of wires connected to the same pins I assume that it is suppose to be like that.. below you will find the exact email that Bruno sent me when I asked about the missing second wire and the 8pin connector.

Bruno's response:
> Hi, The PCB are normally used for different batteries configurations. from 2s to 24s so at the moment we order them, they are based on what we require. Te gap is probably due to the PCB, that is designed to get an 7s battery, so you have 7 positive balance lead and 1 negative on the last pin. because the bms is a 6s model, the manufacture have to disable one cell so they take off the last positive.

But the last pin or last cell in order is always on the opposite end of the grounding pin Not right next to it.
Even the numbers on the PCB behind the socket show that B1 is right next to B-

maybe they just disabled B1 so that B2 is effectively B1. Would that be possible? 
Bruno just responded to my email regarding who makes the BMS and if my wiring diagram is correct.

> HI, the diagram is correct. You can connect all and then check the balance lead with a tester to be sure. But there are no problem. The items are all tested before been sent to avoid issues. 

> Not sure why the client did have this issue. Probably he did some mistake on the connection. You can easly check the pin that is no working. there is no transistor on the trace.

> The BMS are made by smartech

What does he mean by "and then check the balance lead with a tester to be sure" ?
