Hey guys, 

so the title says it all pretty much... I am looking for VESCs that are broken. I want to repair them or possibly use the parts on them for some other project in the future. So if you have a VESC you are willing to sell please let me know. :) 
Ideally with all the parts on it but if you have already taken something off just tell me, I might still be interrested. :) 

Also the reason why the VESC has failed would be nice or maybe just what you think happened or what you were doing when it failed and so on... just some info on its history before i buy it is necessary :) 

Thank you in advance :)

I've a broken VESC-X and some pieces of older VESCs aswell.
Are you in Europe otherwise it would be too expensive to ship broken stuff

Yes I am from Europe but it is not all that expensive it is just slow :D I usually pay around 7 euros for shipping with tracking to America and it takes roughly 3 weeks which is not all that bad for the price. However I have no information on shipping to Europe from other parts of the World..

Well It is hard to value that because there is not as much documentation for FOCBOXes as there is to VESCs. I could try, I just have no idea how much is the VESC schematic and BOM applicable to FOCBOX...

I have two flier vesc, I'd be willing to let go of for $25 each.  One of them does not respond when applying power, the other one failed recently, but I forgot what happened to it.  Both have heat sinks on them.

Hey guys, I want more now! :3 :D I repaired the ones I bought before and they work awesomely. I would prefer if you are in Europe because I am having some tax issues right now with two VESCs that they dont want to let through... mother******s :D

Yeah sure. The shipping is more expensive than the chip tho :D Where are you from? So that I can know exactly what the price is.

Oh OK so the shipping under 150g (lowest weight category) is 4,7€ so I would give it to you for 7€ I order 100 usually from mouser so I still profit like 1€ selling it to you :smile:  Pm me if you are interested. :)
