@JImmy2

I think VESC is Hardware Version 4.12 with FW 2.18 
and maximum FW available is 3.1(Ackmaniac Version) (Correct me if I am wrong)
You can upgrade it to 3.1 using VESC tool
FW files: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t7dl90owz5ccbyl/AAANyC-yQCMeveA7errNRnYqa?dl=0

Latest is higher than that. I think it’s up to 3.6.

Grab the vesc tool and it steps you through it

I would play it safe and get them on the same version

I bet you could run different firmware if you didn't want to update. Just run split ppm and set them both up individually.  
I currently have a vesc 4.11 and a 4.12 that I am running on a dual.
4.12 is the hardware and 2.18 is the firmware. Plug them in and check. They may actually be the same. 
If they are different, and you need to run canbus, just update them. It is really easy.

My bad, thanks for the correction.

You would think working in I.T I would understand versioning!
