I'm getting ready to put together a 18650 10s3p and a 10s4p pack. This will be my first time. It made sense to me to check the capacity, balance the cells and charge them first. Im using an opus BC-C3100 charger on hg2. It takes 5-6 hours to discharge and about the same to charge. I have 70 cells so it's taking a while. Is there a better way to do this?

thanks in advance!

normally if you buy from places like nkon.nl, the batterys are all at the same voltage level, only a few mV to each other.
So there was no point for me to balance them first. I could start soldering after measuring all cells

I got them from ebay off an sellers abandon project. They're seemingly unopened packs. And all pakaging looks legit. So far, the first randomly picked 12 are good averaging about 3100mah.

I connected up TP4056 's to each of my parallel cells when I got them to balance them, before I wired up the BMS. Didn't take that long to balance, left it over-night basically...
