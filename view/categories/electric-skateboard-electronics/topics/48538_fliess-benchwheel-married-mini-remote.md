Hey guys.
After 1.5 years riding Fliess, I seem to finally find a remote which I can trust and use with convenience (subjective). It's called "?".
Yeah, there is no such one. It's either not convenient (Mini Remote) or not reliable (Winning) or almost reliable (Benchwheel) or not very convenient and too much sensitive (Nano-X). I tried all of them.
I love Mini for reliability, and I love Benchwheel for the comfort.

If it happens by chance you also have Benchwheel remote with either broken receiver or if it disconnects sometimes, you can easily marry it with Mini Remote (e.g. https://www.banggood.com/2_4GHz-Radio-Remote-Controller-Receiver-Transmitter-For-Electric-Skateboard-p-1125575.html).

Less words, more pictures:

Get pcb out of Mini, that's all you need from there

Unsolder small receiver pcb from Benchwheel to have more space for Mini's pcb inside Benchwheel remote

Mini pcb almost fits inside Benchwheel remote even without modifications

But small changes unavoidable

Now fits better

2 resistors mock potentiometer, just to avoid Benchwheel blinking all the time about error

Solder all together
https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AEIp9RoU8Y4/WqGxv0LuDeI/AAAAAAAAGII/ZdbFXs202s02yPviahjvoBbt_ZvdjmiCACLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_6723.JPG

Now both Mini and Benchwheel PCBs easily fit together inside Benchwheel remote

And what we have as a result

Okay the thing I most care about is, are you feeding the mini's pcb full lipo voltage?

Otherwise: beautiful job as usual.

The Mini Remote PCB seems to be just fine with 1S Li-Ion.  Ask me how I know...  ;-)

Did you buy that remote for 30$ 60$ or 15$ and is there a difference in the internals If you overpay?

I'm Pitty sure some people just sell them Overpriced.

@deucesdown, thanks dude. Actually from the idea to implementation took 1 after-work evening.

Regarding voltage for Mini pcb - it's connected to the pins where the actual Benchwheel receiver with antenna was. I measured 3V there, so should be just perfect, no less no more than 2xAA.

Nice job @fliess !

You seem to have tested a lot of different remotes but there is no GT2B in your list ? Why ? It is said to be very reliable (never had problem with mine, before or after modding it) and not very expensive too.

Hey @Slak, thanks :slightly_smiling_face: Sure thing, I've heard about GT2B and nice custom cases! Never tried it though, indeed, only because I don't like "index finger" design. And there are almost 0 custom cases offering conversion from index finger to thumb.

What I also like in Mini remote that you can set a small constant acceleration with white potentiometer and make your hands free. Once I did so and throttle got stuck on max acceleration in my pocket. That was really scary :astonished: Since then I don't like index finger designs even more :smile: Throttle is just too sensitive.
```

Okay, I got it.

For the thumb subject, if you don't know it (which I would highly doubt about), check this : http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/gt2b-baby-buffalo-mod-case-3d-printable-thumb-throttle-case/4694

For the stucked throttle in the pocket, I think putting a powered remote in a pocket is a really bad idea. I know people riding like this when it's cold outside and I'm pretty scared for them. But everyone does what he wants as long as nobody gets hurt , I guess ;)

Actually I know this project ;-) I will see, if I have any connection issues with my remote, then the only reasonable option remains legendary GT2B.
Well, it was cold indeed :smile: And I just wanted constant slight acceleration while learning dancing basics.

Hi, what resistance were the resistors you used to remove the error? Iâ€™m thinking about doing this mod, I want absolute reliability with a thumb remote, but the bench wheel has disconnected on me briefly within the first couple days. :frowning: I wanted it to work perfectly so badly. Only the mini remote has worked perfectly for me so far.

@jasonbhuynh, just go for it man, you will not regret. I still, after ~1500km, find this combination the best for convenience and reliability. Any single problem so far.
Unfortunately cannot help much with resistance, since I didn't write it down, neither remembered. But I knew, that if I needed to replicate it again, then I would just measure the resistance of the original potentiometer, which I also suggest you to do :slightly_smiling_face:

@deltazeta, no dude, sure not. There is only battery management part of Benchwheel, which remains functioning after the mod. The rest is reliable Mini.

just finished my attempt at this, made mine without the holes in benchwheel casing.

@fliess how do you know if the remote is running low on power?

[/quote]

as you can see from the pictures, the battery is still connected to Benchwheel PCB, so nothing is changed wrt battery management. It beeps when battery is low. Do not remember if leds signaling as well.

@fliess i just realized the benchwheel wants to turn off after a couple minutes since it thinks its not connected. How did you prevent the auto shut off?

Damn. It seems Benchwheel changed software meanwhile to do this check, because I never experienced anything like that.. BTW, did you add those 2 resistors to mock potentiometer?

But yeah, I did mock the potentiometer with the two resistors, and that worked perfectly

What type of resistors are needed for this mod?
Could you please post wiring for this as well?

Does the mod make the transmitter compatible with the 2.4ghz gt2b receiver or stay with the benchwheel? 

Thanks!!

looks like the software is the issue here, no way to trick it with hardware :frowning:

@PatRocks The mod uses the internals of a mini, not a gt2b, but it does use the mini receiver if done correctly. But I would confirm your benchwheel remote will stay turned on without a connection to the receiver.

@fliess
Thanks for sharing your mod, I took apart both remotes to check if this was something I could do. There are a few things I would like your help with.
Do I use 2 resistors as in your picture below?
![image|666x500](upload://r28be81urFi3u9eVVKt6ucGgzBn.jpeg) 

Or just 1 as in this picture? And where exactly did you solder the upper end of those 2 blue wires. 
![image|666x500](upload://x1S5nAcrXnzVpYfnnzyJoHMaLtY.jpeg)

Your PCB from the benchwheel remote does not seem to have this component will it be an issue for the mod?
 ![image|375x500](upload://t8Se5IuAoUtCO2NI3KP10z0Sufe.jpeg) 

Then, was your battery as big as mine it looks swollen.

there is another one from the opposite side of pcb :slight_smile:

there was a beeper, which I just moved to the bottom to get more space for mini remote pcb

[/quote]

this looks like a radio module, which is a bit different for your instance of remote. Whether it will be an issue depends on Benchwheel software. If you remove it then software may complain and prevent the remote from turning on or turn it off automatically after some time. I would leave it as is for now and try to connect everything together. Again, you never know what Benchwheel has changed meanwhile..

no, mine was ok. Yours looks indeed not good.

your benchwheel pcb looks similar to mine, however I decided to remove the that extra component in order to avoid signal interference. Either that or software led to my remote turning off after 5 mins, so make sure you have a remote that doesn't have that feature. Also i was able to solder the little speaker to the otherside of the benchwheel pcb and that was sufficient to make room for the mini pcb

Thanks for the info, i will try to do the mod i was never able to bind that thing anyways. Using your mod I will use the mini remote receiver, right?

I can see some marking on your battery may I know what I should look for if I plan to order a new one?
