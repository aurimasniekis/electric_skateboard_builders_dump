Not Carvons, but I have a set of Hummies left for sale, that would keep you going.

You can always built a belt drive setup including trucks for 150 bucks. If you already have wheels, make that 120$.

I have a set of dual V2s, but one of the motors is shorted out. Not sure where, and haven't cared to investigate. I bought them from someone who said they had no issues, but one is definitely shorting. Maybe due to a poor soldering job on the phase wires? 

Anyway, I'll let them go for cheap. $100 + shipping
