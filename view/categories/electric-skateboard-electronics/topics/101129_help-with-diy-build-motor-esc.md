Hi everyone 

Another Kiwi here with pretty much no esk8 stuff in our country. 

I am Just getting my first ESK8 project planned out and need some help with motor and some other components. I have built rc stuff since I was about 12, slope soarers, helicopters, drones etc. So i'm no stranger to DIY work. 

It will be a 10s 4p custom battery on 30q's with a single belt drive 6374 190kv

Deck:
Custom built and vacuum pressed 8 layer maple 100cm 

Trucks:
Caliber II 50 degree 10" (purple)

Wheels:
Flywheel 87mm (purple)

Motor:
Looking at multiple and could really use some advice on what is the best price vs performance. 
also best suited pulley system for 87mm wheels. 

ESC vs VESC:
This is one of the parts that I really want to get right and would love some help! again best price vs preformance. 
Would also love to get something that covers a few bases simultaneously, like a pack with ESC, Receiver and remote. Also a power switch and battery indicator. 

Battery:
10s5p 
30Q cells 
I can build this easy enough but need some advice or a plan for a PDB and cahrging system. 

Anyone who helps out is a legend and I'll appreciate any advice I can get at this stage.

Get a flipsky 4.12 single or 6.6 single or maker-x ESC
 https://www.ebmakers.com/collections/x-esc
Remote: nano V2, mini 2.4hgz, Hoyt puck.
Motor: sk3 6374, maytech 6374
Check @dickyho for pulleys.
Check

Make sure the pulleys you choose have enough teeth in mesh, 6 at least.

Thanks for such a quick reply man. 

That maker x is rad af, so sleek might add another veneer to my deck and recess it in with the router. 

Had my eye on the Nano V2 already and think its a good call. 

Think I'll go for the SK3 over the Maytech from what I've read they're a bit more reliable. (could be wrong)

What kind of speed, range and torque do you think I'll get with this build? 10s5p maybe a bit bigger than what I really need?

50cells is plenty. 12wh/km will give you 40km.
3x3.6x50=540wh
Maytech are made for esk8 with key, longer shaft, sensors, silicone wires. Sk3 don't have any of that.

Also consider vesc6, it's the best quality.

Hey I need some advice on which pulley system will work for me I got the 85mm Orangatang Caguamas. 

Also a motor mount for my Caliber II's would be appreciated as the ones i've seen have really bad reviews.
