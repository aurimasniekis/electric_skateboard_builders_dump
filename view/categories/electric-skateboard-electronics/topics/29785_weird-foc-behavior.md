Hey,
So I just finished my board and in BLDC Mode everything is working fine.
I have a 10S Battery, FOCBOX and a 213kv Motor, I limited the rpm to 60.000 and the common stuff should be setup correctly.
When monitoring the realtime data the motor spins up to the 60.000 rpm just fine but as soon as I switch to FOC (doing all the measurements before) I seem to hit a "barrier" at about 30.000 rpm, it wont go higher than 30.000 rpm. 
I'm scared to ride it in FOC and push the motor past the 30.000 ..

Do you guys have any idea? Have I gotten something wrong? Thanks! :slight_smile:
