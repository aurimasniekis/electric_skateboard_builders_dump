Hi Guys,

Which one of the following should I order from DigiKey for a replacement DRV for my VESC (4.12)

They are all the same, just packaged differently, go with the less expensive one, tape and reel.

thanks bud :slight_smile:
Didn't see that it was just a packaging difference :slight_smile:
I ordered one and a 3rd arm setup. Fingers crossed I can replace my DRV without breaking it more :slight_smile:
