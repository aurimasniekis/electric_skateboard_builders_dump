i was wondering if anyone can recommend 2 5s lipo btteries for under 100 dollars, and that will fit in a 2 inch clearance between my board and the road.

You can put all of your size and output requirements in and it will give you options.

Just bought two of these:

Currently working on the build right now, but the thinnest side is 38mm, or 1.5 inches. Around $40 a pop. Hope this helps!

I second those batteries, I have one of them they are great. I accidentally ran one down to like 2v per cell, and successfully revived it. Pretty good batteries for how much they cost. As far as I have looked, that battery actually has practically the highest wh/$ ratio I have found for a hobby lipo

I'd concerned about that ESC; that ESC says it can handle up to 10S but do you want to risk it? Maybe I'm a pessimist. Anyway, you'll probably be underpowering your motor (theoretical max) by over 1000W.

Consider spending some more and buying a VESC (available at DIYelectricskateboard and other places). You get what you pay for.
