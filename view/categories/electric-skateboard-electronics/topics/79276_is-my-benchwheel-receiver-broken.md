So the other day after a sudden braking scenario, and a spark from a phase wire, my Benchwheel remote no longer connects to the receiver. Both VESCs work fine, but I can't pair the remote. I've gone through the community described pairing process many time with no luck. When pairing, should there be more than a single blue solid LED on the receiver? Not sure if that shows that its broken or not. Any help or advice would be awesome

Do you have another remote to verify that the vesc is working correctly?
I'm not 100% sure but I think it would be possible that there was a voltage spike which killed the receiver. :smile:

Don't have another remote, but I've used the arrow keys in VESC tool to confirm that both of them work as intended. I've read a few different stories of people managing to fry their Benchwheel receivers, maybe its time to move onto something else

Hey @Mich21050 if I've blown the receiver, would it be visible on the board? I've had a quick visual inspection and couldn't see anything but there might be something I missed

It depends on what is blown... in some cases you can see it in some not.. but maybe its really time to move to another remote :slight_smile:

I've asked Benchwheel if they'll send another one for cheap, but I'm thinking of a GT2B with some sorta enclosure mod

Was gonna go with the GT2b cos I can get it in Aus for like $40 total, I haven't been able to find an Australian site selling the Mini remote so far

Sure thing. Just get a gt2b and mod it. There are a bunch of different mods on here just take a look... :slight_smile:
