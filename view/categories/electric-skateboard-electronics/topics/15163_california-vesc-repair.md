Hey guys just wondering if there's anyone in the Los Angeles or just California area that's willing to repair a vesc for me. I think I shorted something out on accident. I'd pay for all parts and shipping and labor.

I would totally go with you @JohnnyMeduse, just the shipping to canada is tough and I would rather get it done locally to avoid that. Ever thought of moving to California? :smile:

I totally agree with you, well maybe one day who know :relaxed:.... but, from what I've seen fro  the US repair start at 60 plus shipping.. (mine is 30 plus shipping... it is around the same cost...) ((I'm not doing it for the profit, but for every one who need help))

Yeah you're right but at $60 ill just ditch my crappy DIY VESC(sorry dexter i love your other products) and just get one of ollins. Im just trying to hold out till v6 comes out so i can take advantage of FOC.
