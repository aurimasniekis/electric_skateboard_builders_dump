Amateur question, but are all esc's compatible with lithium ion batteries? I building a 30c 18650 battery, and looking for a compatible esc. I currently own the quicrun WP-8BL150 esc, and would like to save some money after destroying my bank account on the batteries. Any ideas?

you need to find out how much current the ESC can take. The FOCBOX can handle 60amps, for example

Did some research and it says it can take 150A. Should that be plenty?

3 in parallel and 10 in series. To equal 10500mah, and  36-37v. So like this 

1 set - - - - - - - - - -
2 set - - - - - - - - - - 
3 set - - - - - - - - - -

Each cell is  3350mah 3.7v 18650 :slight_smile:

30c

What do you mean with this 30c? Name of cells? Li-ion doesn't use C ratings like lipos.

sure. So there are a few different types of 18650 cell lithium ion batteries. And the type can effect what current you have going for you. popular batteries are the 18650 25R's and 30Q's

EDIT **I don't recoginze the type of 18650 you have listed. (because of the 3350 mah)

I'm not the battery expert but I would recommend getting different batteries. Make sure they are flat top (not button) and don't skimp out on quality. If you are really trying to save money just get lipos.

Alright for sure. I actually just found this battery while going through aliexpress for the battery. This is exactly what I wanted to make. Which would make my life so much easier. What are your opinions? https://www.aliexpress.com/item/electric-scooter-36v-10ah-li-ion-battery-pack-36v-10ah-scooter-lithium-ion-battery-for/32743371336.html

Voth of those battery options are bad. Those can't deliver enough current for your needs. If you do 10s3p use Samsung 30Q or lipos.

It says it delivers 10 amps continuous and 15a max though. Is that not enough for a 190kv motor ?

80A constant is fine. 10s4p 25R or 30Q
```
