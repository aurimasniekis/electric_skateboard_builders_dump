I admire what you've done so far, this is a big contribution to the community.
But how does this fit into the open-source philosophy surrounding the vesc ?
Will you keep source code private or will you publish on Github ?

Every thing has been implemented in to vedders original bldc tool souce code, the bldc tool had know undergone a restructure so to implement widget and qml side by side.

This means that when implementing things like BLE, online firmware update and when I finish video logger implementation it all has also been added to the original widget UI, this means that my work is not just been helping my self but Benjamin as he is busy and doesn't have time to implement these great features.

This will be merged to vedders original bldc-tool  git project once it is stable. But I'm doing this beta program to get help and support and with an extra $1000 under my belt I can sign up for the apple developer account to distrabute beta apps, also I can pay a freelancer to do a little bit of code porting!

If I remove any thing from the souce it will be my own qml UI but I don't think I will need to do this!

Hey Jacob....  You may already know, but you don't need $1000 to distribute beta apps.  A developer account is $99 USD per year, and would permit you to do ad hoc distribution to up to 100 users (well, devices actually).  You just need the unique device ID for each beta tester...

Heya Jacob...  not trying to be annoying, but you still looking to ship the hardware soon?  I ask because I took a tumble and destroyed my Badwolf/GT2B (well, the bike that ran over it actually did the destroying!)...  If it'll be a while, I ought to order another FlySky...  Likely will be useless later, so you see my curiosity.

The receivers can be used with the app that I will be emailing every one providing a link to the android download and instinctions for the apple installation.

The remotes I'll be here next week but then need to be assembled.

Okay, got it.  Tell you what then, appreciate the offer to make separate shipments.  But I'd prefer to get everything at once.  I mean, it would be cool to tinker around with the app and such.  But I'm not keen on switching stuff in and out to actually ride.

Besides, it will save you the cost of shipping twice....   

I will email you directly so you know who this is....

Thanks

Jacob, 
Correct me if I'm wrong but the Bluetooth connects to the same port as the Kama on the Vesc. So I couldn't really use the blutooth module with out the new remote. So I say wait till everything is ready and save on the time and shipping

@bender I think you could already use it with the app that comes with it but I'm on your side. I wouldn't really use it without the remote so shipping everything at once would be a good idea to save jacob shipping costs that could go in more awesome developments :slight_smile:

But i actually thought you could control the board with the slider on the real time data page
See this post:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-android-ios-app/1374/22

Even if you would not have a computer connected but i could be wrong.
Personally I think i wouldn't use the slider while driving (too scarred to drop my phone :smile: )

Email received, thanks @jacobbloy! Any chance of releasing the Android source code, maybe open source,  so I can improve the UI a bit and make a fork with some features I would  use like fast preset switching. To switch  RPM limiting and break power with just one tap or crazy features like GPS based RPM limiting maybe? 

Anyway the app looks complete, I haven't tested it yet, I  have  a spare bluetooth module and I will try to connect it soon, here are some screenshots of the Android version not yet connected

All,  I too received an email from Jacob a few hours ago.  It was flagged as a "Promotion" by gmail, so I didn't see it until I looked.  So, if you are on gmail, go look there.....

EDIT: Also, for iphone users, the email from Jacob asked for UUID.  In fact, you need to send him the UDID.  You can get that information a few different ways.  See here:  https://betafamily.com/superudid or here: https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/udid-sender/id306603975?mt=8

I cannot vouch for the safety of either the betafamily website or the app (though that is presumably safe(r)).

Has anyone received an iOS build yet?

No. Not from him.
I compiled it by myself. But I must say it is not working good. Cant write changed settings to the VESC and some readings are also not correct. Jacob have not said a word to that, after I stated that. I think he don't want someone for beta testing.

I also like Jacobs work and say thanks to him. I also appreciate his work.
But you must know our short private messages. He says he will add me to the beta program two month ago. Nothing happened. Can understand that, because he is maybe busy. But after I compiled it myself and want to contribute I get no response. That is quite disappointing for me, because I put also some work in it. And don't telling us that write settings is not working (the most important thing of this app) looks like hiding it for us. (Maybe just my point of view)

@flatsp0t I think it is not stupid to thing that. Aber vielleicht weißt du es ja besser und ich interpretiere nur zu viel. :sunglasses: Strange thing that the FOC bug (available in Jacobs WIN/MAC bldc-tool from his website) was also available in Gawharys github project to the same time. And fixed a few days after we noticed it. Everybody feel free to combine that for themselves. Frohes schaffen.

yes mate i work with a freelancer his name is Mohammad Gawhary i don't think iv ever kept this a secret i did a big campaign on my website a few months ago acting for donations so i could pay the guy as i have only been coding for lets say 1.5 years and before this app it was all very basic. but this means that its not just my time that has gone into this it is my own money we are looking at about 3K, it is the reason for the beta program to raise money to finish the app. i didn't let you in on the beta program yet because you said you use iOS and as others have said they have not received there iOS app yet.
You where not on my email list because i only emailed ppl that had purchased my beta program, which you didn't you just harassed me until i said yes to letting you test it.

also writing data works fine with no firmware modification i would look at your BLE module to see if it is fake or has the wrong settings like the Baud rate.

The windows and OS X code is combined with the app code as it will be soon combined with benjamins git project, so that any change benjamin makes will be added into the project. if you look into this the code format for BLDC TOOL for desktop has been completely reworked we had to remove the logic that was imbedded into the widget ui to then have 2 different UI classes.

If you support me stop talking bad about me!

I did pay for the Beta program but am having second thoughts now.  I do not wan't to install software on my personal device that I cannot either view the source code myself or know that apple has reviewed it.  How do we have any guarantee that there is not malicious code being placed in your builds since I assume you do not have the knowledge to do a low level analysis based on your 1.5 years experience.  I might just purchase another device for this purpose, but none of this has been discussed openly.

How will you address this @jacobbloy?

@stealth71 A few hours ago you where able to see the code. When the time comes and jacob is putting the app to the appstore you can be sure that apple have reviewed it. So don't worry about that. But that doesn't mean it is 100% save in my point of view.

@jacobbloy Sad to see that you shut down the only possibility for beta testers to test. Gawharys source is not longer available. So maybe its was not a secret, but unintended.
But as @flatsp0t says it is the more common way.

My code is still online, but I have moved it. The reason for this is it I was not ready for others to install it onto there devices. As there where bugs that could damage your vesc and I did not want this to happen to ppl. But it seems that ppl where building it and would still blame me for this. I will send every one clean builds as we make changes and have removed bugs that could cause problems. me as the developer will know what commits are stable to build.

If you build it your self then i have no way of informing you of this information.

I would love help guys and if you have the skill level to do so then please contact me tell me your skills and I then will add you to my git project. I have been asking for help from before this forum existed.

Stop attracting me as I'm doing this as a service to the community, if you do not like the way I'm doing it then suggest a better way or go start your own app.

It's not a scam....  The most that can be said is that perhaps Jacob was too optimistic about delivery times (and I'd note he never promised any delivery by any certain date)....  I think the development of the app has turned out to be harder than originally thought (just my educated guess).

At any rate, I also know he has kids and I believe he also is in the middle of final exams.  So, this is just not a full time job for him by any stretch of the imagination.  At the end of the day, his effective hourly pay rate for doing all this is going to be basically nil, but the community will have a pretty awesome new tool.  So in my opinion, we should just cut him some slack....

This community is terrible for making so many excuses. It's a beta program and all anything anyone has to go off is an app we received 7 weeks after funding closed, without any receivers, which should honestly take less than 3-4 hours TOPS to send out a few bluetooth chips. If he wasn't ready to commit to this, he should have waited. We'd all have our money, and we'd still be in the same position we as consumers are right now.

It's such an ambitious project, but completely mismanaged.

The boards came in almost 2 weeks ago so hopefully progress is being made, but I feel more and more like we are on a bad kickstarter.  Interesting that Jacob works for Enertion now and there haven't been any Enertion vlogs in about a month when they were coming out almost daily.  Thinking this is small company blues and over promising of things that couldn't be delivered.  Not sure if the whole thing is in a downward spiral.  Maybe @jacobbloy can give us an updated or offer refunds again, but I assume he spent the money by now, so we all could be screwed.  I did have to wait 4 months to get my VESCs from Enertion so maybe it's par for the course over there.

I'm pretty sure he took your money and bought the components to make the above boards.  And code, and likely a bunch of other beta program issues.  Sounds like hardware might've changed and likely had to re-code to fix.

This shit takes time.  It's great you gave some money to support this program, but that doesn't give you say in the guys life.  Moving slowly - sure.  It's a project - not his only job.  This is typical of almost every kickstarter and indiegogo - what they estimate and actual time to deliver are hugely different.  If you can't be patient, then you shouldn't contribute.

@Jacobbloy - let me know if a spot opens up to help out w/ my $99.  Best of luck keeping this moving.

I see what you're saying, but $99 does not get you a say into his life.  I'd take time off too if i'd be putting in all my own money and spare time into a project, then dealt with delays, and assorted frustrations trying to keep it on-track.  That sounds stressful, and he likely really needed some time away.

glass is half full kinda guy i guess.

Communication is tough, and larger projects have entire teams of people to manage it.  Being *the guy* who does it all - from coding, to planning, ordering, inventorying, shipping, etc. - a lot of work and communication isn't moving the actual code along towards completion so it usually takes a back seat until a milestone and something to announce.  Then you have folks hounding you to get an update - which takes away from time to get the code or hardware done... it becomes a vicious cycle and super frustrating i'd bet.

I believe is VESC -> Jacob PCB -> Phone

There's an (open source!) project from this April (not mine, from gh: gpxlBen, is he on the forum?) I recently found on github, with a mobile app to doing data logging instead of configuration/anything:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAa55i9OPH8

https://github.com/gpxlBen/VESC_Logger


It look that it works, I don't have that board (adafruit ble uart chip) yet, only Arduino/Duino and Intel edison so I was not able to try it.



related to programming (tl;dr random stuff): But an idea of a uart chip seems cool for this application. I also didn't knew what uart was a thing. (A UART is usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit (IC) used for serial communications over a computer or peripheral device serial port. - "basically a serial port / communication channel between small devices to do RPC - remote procedure call - call functions on the other machine/circuit" - uart means Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter, definitions from wikipedia - I would have name it something like asyncRPC instead of uart) cool stuff...

edit: I tested his app, it works well, I made two videos and I'm extending the app to save the logs into a file that can be exported through itunes and then used to generate video overlays (as Vedder does in its videos). Anyway here are the two videos:

The App looks nice and when I have time and feel confident to drive again I will try to make it also working with the cheaper HM-10 modules. In my opinion the delay must be eliminated when it is possible to make the App useful. Looks like a buffer problem or something like that. So that in the beginning everything is in realtime and then over time the delay increase. That makes it useless for long time logging. Maybe the update rate of the VESCs Uart is to fast.

I haven't looked at that part of the code yet, for real-time visualization it misses also the current value, it has only the average and the max value, to get the latest value you have to tap and swipe on the chart to the right edge. I already implemented the logging to file and pushed the changes to my fork, I will do some testing to see if it works.

I ordered the adafruit ble uart chip, which seems to be the solution here. The open source Iphone app seems to work well, and I hope to tweak it some to add new features. I'm super excited to get my hands on it. I was debating whether or not to get involved in this beta project, but I'm glad I stayed out and a new option has popped up. The great part is that theres no firmware changes that need to be made. 1 setting on the vesc needs to be changed, and a few wires connected. Very straight forward, and if you can solder together an eboard, you can make this bluetooth chip work with your vesc.

https://github.com/gpxlBen/VESC_Logger

Check it out, order one of the chips. He links everything there, even the chip to buy. It's as straight forward of a solution as you'll find. This guy is still updating it with new features, and I'm going to be involved in it as soon as my bluetooth chip arrives.

It would be ideal to eliminate it, but it's still useful. When building a board, knowing the max amps you will draw is very important. It determines the gauge of wire you need to use in your battery and the max continuous amps your battery can handle.

Right now, I'm in a situation where I ave no idea, because the watt meters I'm using are so inaccurate. I trust the vesc knows the correct value, as we are trusting its protections (like max amp cont settings) will work, so it better be right.

It's also important to know how hot you are getting your vescs. It will be easy to determine if they are overheating or not, or if they are even getting close. This will help determine whether heatsinks are necessary on a certain build.

Despite the loss of sync, you can still utilize this data to make decision about your electrical system.

And trust me, I will be looking into this bug personally.

This chip and app will be the solution in the end, as the support network of developers is there (so far the original developer, @makevoid, and me)

Small claims in Australia favours those that weren't given what they were promised, if that's the route you decide to take. Not sure of the legality involved with international trade (I assume you are international due to your comment).

@jacobbloy,  don't get me wrong, I like what you are doing but it's time to face the truth. It seems that a lot of your ideas are good but then failing at the end. 

Hope this is not the case with this one, but I have my doubts when looking at your track record with hub motors starting at ES some 18 months ago and the developments until now with no finalized product.

So it seems best to wait another 2 weeks and if there are no further updates I am out.

Once again rapid response @jacobbloy proving his worth to the community.  No reply from you in 20 days.

Looks like we are all FUCKED!!!!  Thanks for stealing our money.  Hopefully you learned your lesson about fucking up and making promises that you can't fulfill.  Now we all know the true character that you have.

Does anyone live in Austrailia?  http://www.courts.sa.gov.au/RepresentYourself/CivilClaims/MinorClaims/Pages/default.aspx

I am going to contact and attorney and see what the options are since there has been no action by @jacobbloy 

From the hub motor thread:
[quote="jacobbloy, post:439, topic:4762, full:true"]
Iv already exhausted all of the money given in preorders for producing and about $4000 has gone out in refunds. the motors clearly they have some issues. If you would like to make a PayPal dispute please do I can not refund you direct as I have no money but PayPal will still help you and chase me for the money. I already have a PayPal dept collector calling me because my account is in negative.

I still have the motors and if I find a suitable fix or you want to find one your self I will ship them to any one who is left as this is cheaper for me.

I'm sorry for letting every one down honestly I just tried to reach to far with making moulds and boxes ect but I think every one has waited to long.

@jacobbloy 
Just try to do better communication.
That's all. 

After the hub motor issues I would be very carefully too.
The remote is a safety relevant part and you shouldn't rush through the assembly.
I'm willing to wait for a good product which doesn't want to street my face.

Its very difficult for Jacob right know with all you greedy bastards taking your money back :smiley:
Since I ordered I had no reason to skip a meal because I weren't able to pay for it.
You backed up a beta product so you have to be patient. If you need a remote fast for cheap go and buy a GT2B.
The idea of crowd founding is to share the risk so you shouldn't jump in if you cant afford to loose that money.
I still think my money was spent good and Jacob will come up with a great product and a huge contribution to all of us.

Time is running quick and schedules change. That's life!
And if e-skateing is teaching you something for life beside electrics and engineering it is PATIENCE and more PATIENCE.

Give him some time to make a product and leave him some money to feed his family.
I have the hubs as well and follow this thread too, so I know the whole story. Poor communication that's all he did wrong.

Well he did post on the hub motor thread and we are all up the river without a paddle @jacobbloy just can't come to terms with informing people of their fate it seems.  Maybe you should start driving for Uber or delivering pizza on the side to make some extra money and dig yourself out of this hole instead of giving all of us the shaft.

[quote="jacobbloy, post:476, topic:4762, full:true"]
Hi guys, I know this is a terrible situation but I am still trying to ship the motors to those who want them but at this point I don't have they money for shipping. After to many refunds that I have already given.

I want every one to have there motors and or refund. If you can wait it will help me a lot. It will give me some breathing room so I can clear my PayPal account and then save some money to pay for shipping the motors.

Please remember I'm only a student with 2 children so I don't have a huge wage to just pull out of and settle the money PayPal are asking me for because of further refunds that have been requested.

And I'm not gonna just run away!

Don't worry, I'm working on an alternative that should be ready within the next week. Just going through the final steps of the apple store review process. So it should be there within the next week. I already have 6 modules soldered up and ready to be shipped, and I have another 8 I need to assemble. The app is not perfect, but I will be making a new app and I will try to fix the minor bug in this app still (the graph lags  over time. It's likely an issue with the refresh rate of the graph, but I've been too busy to look into it. It really doesn't effect your ability to see whats going on with your vescs, it's a minor annoyance.
