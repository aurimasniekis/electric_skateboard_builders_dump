I need an anti spark soldered that would go in between a lipo series connector and vesc. Venmo works best...

This is the series connector ![image|231x500](upload://n6tEVJmpD0NGxKQSVOaGqnPZNaq.jpeg) 

This is the vesc ![image|231x500](upload://2ryd1DfjQsXGWLi2WkMHuRfCupf.jpeg) 

I need it to be configured like the 9mm bullet connector to xt90 adaptor in this picture except the appropriate connector from the series connector instead of the 9mm ![image|666x500](upload://6hD7feuTRzNLroNVGz82nwJ9SrV.jpeg)
