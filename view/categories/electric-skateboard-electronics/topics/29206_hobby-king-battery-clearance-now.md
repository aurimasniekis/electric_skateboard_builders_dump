graphenes or heavy duty. not smaller than 5Ah and not below 40C and you good to go.

Edit: I just had a look, the 8Ah and 12Ah graphens are good as well, even with a lower C rating.

Is it possible that this analytic site is also made by hobbyking? :'D I didn't followed these prices but I have a 1300 mAh drone battery from them and its quite good. 

https://precios.analytics.cat/en/batteries-chargers/batteries/lipo/turnigy-graphene-professional-12000mah-6s15c-lipo-pack-w-xt90/

Is it really a good price? I also believe that its too complicated to overthink them because only they know how old batteries they sell at these clearance actions. Am I right?

I can suggest these Turnigy Graphene 8000mAh 6s, despite only 15c works fine with 2 sk3 149kv motors.

Can I expect ~30-40 km range from two of these? Or that is when 2x 12000 mAh batteries come at place?
Thank you

all depends on where you drive and how you drive. with pneumatics you can roughly say 10-15km with 12s 5Ah. 15km really only street and easy going.

I mean with pneumatic wheels 6-9â€œ.With urethane longboard wheels you will get a way better range.
