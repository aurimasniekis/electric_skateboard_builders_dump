Just following a link to one of those c5056 270 kv sensored motors...looks interesting for <$50.

then I found this [Hub + vesc (china) ](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Eletric-Skateboard-Kit-1-Hub-MP83mm-Motor-3000w-1-VESC-1-Radio-System-/262579614066?hash=item3d22f6f172:g:zsQAAOSwIgNXslOo)

and these [vesc mod uk](http://www.ebay.com/itm/VESC-4-12-Motor-controller-open-source-BLDC-Speed-Controller-VESC-vedder-Pcb-/182244594544?hash=item2a6e9fd370:g:oFwAAOSwZ1BXe6Ct)

[vesc (china)](http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-VESC-12S-50A-F-VESC-BLCD-Motor-Speed-Controller-Eletric-Skateboard-/262562490271?hash=item3d21f1a79f:g:siYAAOSwaB5XrgfD)


The uk vesc looks interesting. looks like they put all the smd componets on a single sided board and then the hv (Mostfets, shunts) stuff on another, connected by headers.
then a huge heatsink on all mostfets. 

jst thought it looked interesting...
