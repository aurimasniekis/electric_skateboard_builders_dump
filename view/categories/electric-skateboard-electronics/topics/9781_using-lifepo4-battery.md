Hi. Did any one try to use LiFePo4 battery? Thay can last up to 2000 charges got better resistant to discharge and overcharge vs lipo.

We have a couple people here who have used them. Boosted also used it in their boards. I personally am holding off since they're not as energy dense and heavier.

If they be used as 12s with dual motor, small different in nominal voltage will not make different for boost. Waight for small skateboard that is minus but on mountain board should be okay

Do you know what batteries they use? A123?

Yup, A123. Someone opened one up before. I've also got the same pack as a Boosted board. 12s1p A123 26650 cells.

I'm using a similar pack like @Pantologist if you want to check out the build - http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/a2esk8-mini-cruiser-30-carbon-fiber-deck-single-carvon-v2-hub-motor-12s1p-lifepo4-vesc/5543

I recently repackaged a 12s lifepo4 from a METROBOARD for my next build.  It powered the METROBOARD no problem 6374mm motor.  The chemistry is safer than lion and you can pull more amps out of less batteries than lion.

But if you're running 1 pack, that's usually under 3Ah. How far would that usually get you? A123 26650 are 3.3V nominal * 12 in series * 2.5Ah = 99Wh. Seems like they're using A123 for sure. Can you really go 6-7 miles with only 2.5Ah? That's crazy. A 12s2p of A123 seems to be decent for everyday + a little more usage.

A123 cells are really really expensive. $6.8/cell to $10/cell depending on which version you get.

I have used LiFePo4 batterys in a battle bot and the transmitter. In my experience they are much stabiles than LiIon and LiPos. Ender charging is much less of a issue. You will still damage the pack but not your house. I have even seen people stab almost dead pack and not have a issue. Im not saying to go poking LiFePo4 pack but you kinda can.

I run 40152 LiFePo's from EVAssemble.com on a couple of boards - they are super-heavy and not sufficiently energy-dense for the weight - you can't realistically go bigger than 6s1p, though I do have one board thats 9s1p 38120's.  I'm slowly moving away from them.

But I will say that I've never had a problem with them - they are simple to setup and bulletproof.  I don't have enough experience with the LiPo's to say the same.

Im running 7s A123 20AH prismatic cells. Been running great at very high current and no bms. I even ran the cells down to zero a few time never any issues reviving them. no puffing. just a little reduced capacity. after multiple charges per day and alot of riding for 1yr i still get close to 15AH out of the pack.

Only downside is they are bigger, heavier and more expensive than lipo or lion. 

But i charge and sleep with peace of mind :wink:

I can't seem to find any accurate specs for these batteries. Does the manufacturer even have their own website?

How are they working out for you?

```
What specs are you looking for over and above that which is listed on the page?

I was pretty worried too when I bought them - I had earlier bought a different brand (though they look exactly the same) and was disappointed when they unceremoniously disappeared.

But these are working out well - caveat that I don't have that many cycles on them - like a lot of people here I enjoy building the boards more than riding them, but they've been solid.  I won't hesitate to use them when I build my powerwall :slight_smile: 

If it weren't for the weight and the 3.2v vs 3.7v nominal I'd have stuck with them.

A Boosted board charger works. All you have to do is search for 43.2v lithium chargers.

Have you tried searching for a 43.2v lithium power supply? Mean Well supplies are easily adjustable internally with a potentiometer.

Kinda late to the thread here but [my build](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/thiqqboard-earthwing-supermodel-2017-torqueboards-6355-190kv-dual-12s4p-lifepo4-288wh-vescs-90mm-wheels/) also uses LiFePO4 batteries - the downside is the board is kind of heavy but I'm not gonna worry about dying in a fire while I'm sleeping lol

LiFePO4s can still go into thermal runaway... that is no joke a lot of energy being converted to heat. Things can easily go south with any battery chemistry. Has to be properly monitored and managed all the time.

Dude, you can count the people that had lipos actually spew fire on 1 hand.  I just don't understand why people wanna throw that crap around. Doesn't help at all.

Yeah... mostly uninformed people spew that kind of info around, but safety is a concern with any battery chemistry. 

Lipos are the most popular hobby grade chemistry so the chances of a poorly managed battery being used in normal operation are high and that usually leads in a failure of some kinda, either by thermal runaway or something more explosive.

I'd rather have the worst case failure mode be what you see in the three videos below, which is much less violent than the worst case failure mode of a LiPo. I make sure to double check everything in my build (and so do most people, especially those on this forum) so that normal operation is fine but you never know what can happen. I saw a video where someone riding a boosted had some driver turn into them and break their board in half. What happens if you're using prismatic LiPos or Li-Ion? Most likely something worse than these three videos.

What do you mean by it "doesn't help at all?"

Everything is a risk assessment with probability involved, and I'd rather not be liable for damages due to near explosive thermal runaway when someone else fucks up my build.

I dig it.  I preach balance charging.  I believe in managing your battery system no matter the chemistry. 

I push my lipos hard, and I've never even had one get puffy. You just have to be careful, think about what your doing. I don't think lipos are significantly less safe than other chemistries.

Hey)

Could anyone please tell me the best (preferably smallest) BMS I could use with the LiFePo4 cells in 12s1p configuration? Or maybe does anyone know where I could order a custom BMS to be made for me?

Thanks

[BesTech](http://bestechpower.com/384v12spcmbmspcbforlifepo4batterypack/) and [SuPower](http://www.batterysupports.com/lifepo4-nbsp-36v-nbsp-12s-c-32_35.html) both offer an number of LiFePo4 BMSs for 12s. Out out of these two I'd probably go for BesTech (you'll have to order minimum of 2), as they do some customisation and seem to have a better reputation around here, some models include an e-switch. The voltage cutoffs for the SuPower BMSs won't really work well for my A123 setup; could be ok for yours.

A SmartBMS would work, they'd work for any chemistry / battery config. There's a few options including [JTAGs open source BMS](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diebie-jtag-12s-bms-gauging-interest-nonprofit/20947), and [Raphael Chang's BMS](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/raphael-chang-bms-and-esc/8952). Timelines on these may be a bit longer than you'd like...

If you're after something that can be ordered right now, then the [Energus TinyBMS](https://www.energusps.com/shop/product/tiny-bms-s516-150a-750a-36?category=4) could be your best bet. It's also probably one of the smallest BMSs you'll find. Think I'm leaning towards this option right now.

Thanks you for your answer @lock !

I found a company which is willing to fully customise the BMS for me, could anyone please tell me:
What is the peak charge and discharge current for the 12s1p, 39V 2500 mAh system?  
Do I require any output for cooling?  
Do I need any communication with the outside world and if so, what protocol?  
Any other special requirements do I need the BMS to do? 
I'm looking to make the closest battery to the Boosted battery.

Thanks for any help in advance!

Maybe someone know what settings I can use for lifepo4 battery in Ackmaniac app? 10% 20% 30% 40%... Because lifepo4 works betwen 3.3-3v. Maybe someoone know how to configure it correct. Thank you!

Bad news, A123 tend to hold nominal voltage until empty, then drops off a cliff. Since the "not empty" voltage range is small, it's difficult to estimate capacity based on voltage.

http://www.revolectrix.com/support_docs/item_1229.pdf

Note, A123 behaves a bit differently from generic LiFePo4.

lithium iron are able to bouce back easily from over discharge at least.  they're pretty indestructible compared to lipo and li-ion.  videos on youtube guy from endless sphere charging as high as he can and shooting them with a crossbow.  the screw tabs on the headway cells are awesome.  and they do high discharge in the red shrink wrap
