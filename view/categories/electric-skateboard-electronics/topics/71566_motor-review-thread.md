Share with us what are some good motors that you've used? Would help a lot of us with our journey to find good esk8 motors. 
Can be sensored or unsensored. All sizes 
If you recommend a motor and then have issues with it, let us know what happened!

There's already a couple of decent threads about this. Basically it depends on what you want from your motor- speed, stealth or torque.

I've heard nothing but great things about the SK3s and the newer, sensored SK8s. I know of dudes that have put thousands of miles on their SK3s and my SK8s have taken quite a bit of abuse, regularly scraping on gutters and stuff and I've had no issues

Honestly, I dont think we have any idea which motors are good.  We dont have reliable data on failure rates.  It seems like the only people with better knowledge on motor quality are the people who are commissioning runs from the factories and selling them, so yeah... sight conflict of interest.

So in lieu of making actual informed decisions, it comes down to the "you get what you pay for" crowd vs the "budget motors are good enough" crowd, with no way of actually proving anyone right.

bearing quality and magnet wire enamel quality might be important, but we dont know how to identify quality

1) magnet problems
2) shaft problems
3) overheating (current limits set too high?)
4) bearing quality
5) waterproofing (sensored only)

Good list of qualities to look for, but unfortunately there are challenges.  With 1, 2, and 4, there is little that the buyer can do to identify motors that will exhibit these issues.  With 3, it is likely user misuse, excessively high motor currents set in VESC configurations because retailers are not properly communicating that lower Kv motors have lower current limits.  5 is a valid concern, and easy to check as well, but probably relatively minor in terms of significance.

So in the end we're still left with mostly hearsay and sporadic reports of motor failure.  I can't say with confidence whether an SK3 or a Maytech has stronger magnets, better retaining epoxy, or higher quality bearings.

overheating will cause problems if the insulation grading is insufficient, which could cause a short in the windings and a burnt out motor..  (and esc?)

with higher insulation temp rating you won't get those same issues, although the heat might be bad for the magnets.

But didnt you change out all the bearings and then didnt you have to reglue the magnets in one of the sets? Like for you that may not be a big deal, but i think that when we order a "quality"  product, we should get good stuff, and not have to go through that hassle.

I agree, there's a lot of value to this kind of discussion.  We just have to be careful to collect data in a way that isn't going to be overly afflicted by things like confirmation bias.  How do we figure out what the actual failure rates are like for all these different motors, when tons of people use them without problems, and a few people encounter issues and post about it?

I really like the Keda motors, I have had 4 of them all of which have worked flawlessly. I’m not going to say they compete with larger motors because they probably don’t but for the price they are great. The only downside I have found so far is the lack of silicone wires, and maybe hall sensors

A very valid point. I think that given the size of the community, we should (over time) be able to see clear results negating outliers of bias or false facts. That and time. Giving a central hub to post about issues encountered will allow for new users to know what to stay away from, and allow seasoned veterans to get an idea of what causes failure. Could even be an appropriate feedback hub for any company that wants feedback. Who knows.

To be on topic here's my experience with some motors:

Torqueboards:
One arrived damaged on arrival, never got it sorted out ended up buying some used that ended up failing due to premature bearing failure. (Both 6374 and smaller)

Maytech / Eskating.EU / Unikboards:
Had a pair of 6374 of the glossy ones from Maytech rebranded by Eskating, really good quality, never had an issue and really nicely put together only thing is they look bad really fast.

Flipsky:

Really good experience with their 6354s, I have 4 in total two of the ones with 2 and two with 4 holes the 2 hole models seems really good ive put 300 - 350km on a pair so far and no issues what so ever but the 4 hole model did have an issue with one of them very quickly after I installed it, it would rattle and make strange sounds it but I was offered a new one to replace it so that's on the way the other one from that batch has so far done 40km rides just fine.

Has anyone used @dickyho motors? I have one of his 6374 motors and it’s not bad. This is my first board though so I don’t have anything to reference. 
Complaints so far-
- wires are only 16gauge. Seems really thin. 
- sensor connector doesn’t plug in directly to TB VESC. Connector is too small. 
- not actually 74 long, more like 70mm

I’ll definitely be riding it year round and testing the water resistance.

The details I don’t see on their site but I’m guessing could be a bunch of stuff but ultimately it will stay cooler and run more efficiently than something similar sized. 

Better copper fill.  Higher winding insulation temp ability. Higher temp curved mags.  Thinner steel laminations.  Just better design.  Cooling better.

I have had good luck with racestar 5065 140kv. Run for about a year without issue, I ride in heavy rain a lot and honestly expected the bearings to be dead by now. I have had other bearings on my board die in that time from loosing the lubrication. 

These have even run under water when I went through a 4 inch deep puddle. 

Pretty sure they use legit NSK bearings with some long life lubrication. 

I opened them when new and coated the sensor board. No maintenance since. 

The main downsides is they don't make them in all black anymore and  they are not the most powerful. 

I wish racestar would make 63xx size motors in the same design.

theres no real voltage limit on motors. the voltage limit of the wire enamel is thousands of volts or something and not a concern till thousands of hours above a high temp.  the motor bearings have a limit.  sometimes places put a voltage limit in the interest of keeping the amps down but we have better control than they thought, ...you can take any motor and spin it at 22s and at 1000amps!   the amps of course for a fraction of a second and the voltage isn't an issue as long is the motor doesn't spin so fast as to mushroom or the bearings explode or seize or something.   all the numbers advertisers use are made up.  wattage voltage amperage.  somehow id heard hacker were good but the one test I found showed just as well as the ..stk (or whatever the hobbyking sells them as, the letters i forget haven't had one in years.  )

with the vesc and data logging and maybe a temp sensor would make it really easy, someone could do a real review.  a standardized test ...as it seems in the wider world for electric outrunners is not possible.  they have no test and just make stuff up.    but that's all testing for most efficient transformation of electricity to mechanical force and in the electric skateboard world a good review means it didn't break.   and you can get some enamel and brush it on for that.  with a slightest loss in your motors electrical performance but no one is counting.  but some of those coatings wont trap the heat but instead give it a path out and work better than not. 

 the outrunners are likely designed for planes and to be somewhat light but the magnet field is escaping out the back and with a steel pressed on sleeve or even glued I bet it would make a better motor.

This is my experience too with destroying many brushless motors in RC models. Voltage max is irrelevant so long as you don't exceed the load capacity of the motor. Max Amps on the other hand is an issue too many amps and you melt the insulation on the windings. Amps is also proportional to the load put on the motor. Choose the wrong gear ratio or propeller size and you can kill a motor in a few seconds from overheating. On the other side if the motor is under loaded you can run much higher voltage without issue, until the g-force of the rpm starts to rip the motor apart. Which you would never reach in an e-skate application. 

Also to hummies point the specs from manufactures are impossible to trust and every one of them seems to use a different method to determine max current / voltage / watts.  Watts is really the most important one as heat handling is the critical spec.

[/quote]

Agreed, and in lieu of good data on long term reliability, that means all we really have to go on is max current ratings.  Sadly, even max current specs are often kind of made up by retailers.  So in the end, all I really go off of is:
1) higher Kv = more current = generally better
2) convenience features (keyways, pre-ground motor shaft flat, flexible leads)
3) cost

What you think is the max temperature you can/should run a motor?
```

---
## \#59 Posted by: lrdesigns Posted at: 2018-10-18T04:50:14.729Z Reads: 203

```
From my understanding the actual max limit is determined by the exact makeup of the 
1. Insulation spec on the windings
2. Magnet material
3. Magnet glue or other glues used in assembly. 

But no one tells you these exact details unless it's a really high end motor. 

So for general rule (unknown materials) under 60c is safe over 80c going towards unsafe. If you put your hand on the motor and it burns your in less than 5 seconds its too hot.  Very well specced motors could be happy at 120c but these are rare. Under 100c should be ok for most motors but I would not encourage that, best stay below 60c for long life.

I have minimal experience with the motors we use for eskating purposes since I only have a set of eskating.eu (maytech) sealed 6355s. So far they have been fine apart from 2 problems.
1. I constantly overheat the motors (I have set the limit on my VESCs at 80C)
2. The tiny grub screws that hold the shaft to the motor can are not enough (not to mention they strip if you look at them wrong).

I want to buy a set of 6374s but I am torn between the sealed and the normal version.
The sealed is, well, sealed :smirk: but I expect the normal version to have better cooling.
Since I live in a country that can get quite hot during the summer I lean towards the latter.
I try not to ride in rainy weather but there are some days where you just can't help it.
What would you do?

Honestly, the factory selling sensored sk3s probably takes the crown at the moment. They are tried and tested in every kind of build and the only downside has been a lack of sensors and the fact that they are open.

Neither bothers me personally

Before we get too excited to spend 200+ on motors from hacker, keep in mind that they are still OEMing from a Chinese factory and we basically no way to verify that they are having motors made with tighter quality controls. It comes down to internet anecdotes and brand trust. Otherwise, emax markets what visually appears to be the same motor at a cheaper price. Is hacker marketing a better product? Probably, maybe, maybe not, we don't know. Very frustrating.

I’m surprised with all the testing equipment rc plane people have there isn’t more comparison. Hacker from what it seems on the web could be totally the same motors as others a fraction the price.  At least scorpion motors make claim of better high temp curved magnets and they specify the lamination thickness. 

But eskate more than anything just need motors not to break

But there’s some fancy German outrunner company I forget the name.  Doing stuff.  

Maybe hacker has better inrunners

No one in the RC world cares about our comically large 50mm and 63mm motors unfortunately.  There are some big motors in the quad world, but those are like 7018 motors, which I suppose could work well, but might look kind of funny.

This is the real problem, it's easy to test for motor output efficiency and short-term max current capability.  It's not easy to test for long-term durability.

Anyone up for some science?

There are already quite a few suitable motors now.  The problem is that no matter what motor you use there will always be someone who has had an issue.  Use the tried and tested units that people have been using for years and you should be fine. 
For example;  I have 4 sk8 192's  Out of the four 1 threw a bearing.  After 50 km of use.  Would I recommend them to someone else?  Of course I would, it was an anomaly.  It was replaced and all good. 
I have 2 maytechs which have been fine for a year.  Would I recommend them?  Yes of course I would.
I have 2 sk3 which are my personal favourite and obviously I would recommend them 
I have 2 tb 6374's that are fine after 6 months and again recommended.
I have 3 cheap generic chinese oem motors that have all failed.  I bought them because they were **cheap** and no I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
Point is no motor or indeed anything we use is going to be bullet proof (that's the holy grail) but you get what you pay for and you pay for good quality control and decent customer service for when that QC lets you down.

[Hacker](https://hackermotorusa.com/), along other german brands like [Plettenberg](http://www.plettenberg-motors.com/estore/index.php?) and [Lehner](http://www.lehner-shop.com), are regarded as one of the best electric motors you can get for any type of RC modeling.

Maybe their inrunners are something special but hacker outrunners are possibly the same as many other brands and from same factory, so I read on the web. Rediculous there aren’t decent comparisons available.  That seems half the hobby.   The other German brands like Lehner and pletten... I think maybe those are something legit.  At least Lehner has that nice potential to reterminate wye or delta.  I don’t see any claims of materials or airgap diameter.  Stuff seems sold for a fortune based on no facts.

That would imply people willing to buy it in the first place to compare it. It's easy to do so for May-techs and Flipsky since they're cheap and at times plug and play. Not so much motors that are $250+

Yeah. Unfortunately for most. Don't forget those brands and those motors belong to a different world (RC modelling). Esk8s were still decades to be invented when these German motor manufacturers already existed producing motors for the RC car & airplane market (a expensive one). In the end, anybody spend their money the way the want, no? :sunglasses: :wink:
