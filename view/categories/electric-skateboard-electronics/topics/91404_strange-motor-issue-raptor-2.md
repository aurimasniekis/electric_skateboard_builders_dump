Hi all,

I am asking for help on this forum as I do not have warranty on my Raptor 2, so was wondering if you guys can help out.

The motors run fine, up hill, full throttle, anything.

Only issue is, when stationery the left motor needs me to spin it before it starts up, while the right motor moves only a little bit and when i spin the left one both work perfectly.

This means i have to push to start always, other than that the motors work fine.

Does anyone know what could be causing this?

Thank you.

Sounds like a sensor issue. Maybe check the sensor cables?

I was thinking this also, but i have put silicone around my enclosure to waterproof it, i might have to open it after all.

Yes you will have to open it up. Could be caused by vibrations.

I just opened it, tried it with the sensor cable unplugged, it works fine.

When plugged in again issue comes back.

Can i just run one of them unsensored, what are the downsides?

Can i run both unsensored?

i cannot get the focbox to connect because the USB cable port is damaged.

I can do it via vesc tool (TCP) but that requires me to upgrade firmware and i am not very acquainted with that.

Via enertions vesc tool i cannot connect to Master focbox.

You can connect with the other focbox and use the can bus to get access on the focbox with the broken usb port or get a BT module like metr.

Theres a easy solution to this problem

Step one : Throw the raptor away

Step two : Start reading on this amazing DIY forum

Step three : Build yourself a beast and forget about prebuilts

nothing wrong with uncensored, it's just that you have to reconfigure the foc boxes for uncensored

or else it might blow the focbox

Best thing you can do is take the Focbox with the bad usb port out and send it out to be repaired. Many people fix focboxes for a reasonable price
