Alu lipo tabs obviously can't be soldered normally.

I've seen some alminium soldering flux on ebay from Poland that supposedly works. But is there a cheaper, more local (UK) solution?

Apparently different types of solder may do the trick?

Thanks.

You *should* spot weld them, because you're still applying a lot of heat right next to the battery when you solder. You can open up the cell itsself if the adhesive has time to heat, so use a really large soldering tip and crank it all the way up in heat.

I've used 91-9 Tin-zinc solder + Aluminum Solder flux (Reccomended by a teacher as a good combo), but I'm sure there are other combos that work - the flux is the important part. 

I managed to find mine in Maplin, but they've closed down now and most maplins are too small to have it. If you check wickes they may have some, or a local hobby shop if you have one near to you. You can also [find them online](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Active-flux-for-low-temperature-soldering-aluminum-and-its-alloys-25ml/123864481202?hash=item1cd6e5fdb2:g:th4AAOSwfi1cyWuU) [ebay uk], just make sure to apply generously and be careful. If possible, find one with wires presoldered and splice the wires instead, a much simpler job.

I bolted the tabs together :P.

Works really well actually, the lipo cells I have had indents for bolts, I used short #6 machine screws and large fender washers.
