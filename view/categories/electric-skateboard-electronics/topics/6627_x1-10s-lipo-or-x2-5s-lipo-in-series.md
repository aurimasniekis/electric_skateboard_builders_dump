Hey guys, 

I am at the battery stage of my build and trying to figure out which one is the best option. Should i buy a 10s LiPo battery pack or should i buy two 5s Battery packs and make them into a 10s series. Or is it the same thing? are there any extra benefits?

I was thinking if i buy a 10s lipo pack i can wire it in parallel to another 10s for more board time? would this work?

it's the same thing except when you buy 2x 5s you can swap from parallel to series. 
And when one cell goes bad. You only have a 5s pack that is bad instead of a 10s pack. 
would go with the 2x5s

ahh okay thanks. what if i wanted to parallel two 10s batteries using this setup... Would i have to series two sets of 5s batteries and then parallel them up? or wouldn't that work?

you need 4 x5s lipo's

2x 2 in series makes 10s with 2* capacity. 

How big would you like your capacity to be? 10s*8000mah has a bigger range  than the space cell pro 3.
So you don't really need the parallel battery

```
how big is that range? would just two 5s batteries with high capacity be enough? or would i be better with more batteries?

I have researched a lot about this but still get confused a bit

space cell pro 3 has a range of 30km. (advertised on enertion site)

and is 7500mah 10s

you can get 5s zippy flightmax 8000mah if I'm correct. 
put 2 of those in series.

ahh that sound great, but doesn't it all depend on top speed too? the faster you go the less range you get? i plan on going around 25-28 MPH

Depends on hillgrade , speed, how many times you stop and accelerate again. etc

I get over 10 km on 20kph, perfectly flat, and cruisin without braking and stopping, with a 6s 5000mah zippy

ahh oka thanks, I think 2 5S 8000mah will do fine, if not then ill upgrade them

```
i have 25C 5000mah so 125A

you should be fine with 20c 8000mah = 160A
or even 15C 8000mah = 120A

Yeah, that was the one i was looking at. Two of those in a series should do the job. 

Oh i am also running a dual motor, does this make a difference or not?

I would highly recommend a different esc, as this one will have no brakes or very hard ones. Get a rc car esc or a vesc

if you want to enjoy your esk8 to the maximum it is 100% worth of buying 2 maytech vesc's 4.12 of their site on aliexpress. 

You can compensate with buying these motors ( which I use and are very good and powerfull for their size)

There is also a 140 kv version, depends on your gearing, both are good ! 
+ for 3 euro you have a motorpulley also on aliexpress :

[/quote]


Better isn't the word.  On one hand you will have more torque. The other is higher top speed.  Which you can control by changing gear ratios.  Probably limited to 10s with the 200kv motors or limit erpm within the vesc
