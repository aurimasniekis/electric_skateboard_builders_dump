hi I'm a student from Belgium and I want to build my first electric longboard.
I already choose some parts for my build and I want to know if these work together.

esc:

battery: 2 in series

Yep they will. I'd suggest running two of those batteries in series for 10s... And don't forget to grab a remote from alien too :)

Do you know how to program the esc with my pc?
And would this remote do the job?

You will probably get more info/response if you move this into a build thread....

You would be much better off to spend a little more for ESC and get a Vesc.
It will be much more programable and have much better brakes that are also regenerative.
