I just got a new soldering station (the zeny 2 in 1) with a hot-air gun (pen? iron? blower? you get the picture) built-in.  I have a VESC with a burned-out DRV chip on it that i want to try to replace.  Once i have the vesc physically repaired, how do i flash the firmware/set up the software again? I think i need some special USB thing to connect straight to the DRV and skip the mini-usb port, right? what is that, where do i get it, and how do i use it?

If you don't remove or change the MCU, you don't need the reflash the firmware... there no firmware to program on the DRV ðŸ˜‰
