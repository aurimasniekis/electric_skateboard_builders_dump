I am doing a design of a riser with a headlight inside I was inspired by fottaz design!

At first I wanted to use this little leds but I can't source them for all my board I only have 1

So I decided to use the shred lights I have and I have never used 
My plan is to remove all the pcb except the led one and directly link them to 5v from my receiver

What do you think? Any idea on what type of leds I could use, some RGB maybe? What type of pcb are those with the single led, maybe it exists with dual?
