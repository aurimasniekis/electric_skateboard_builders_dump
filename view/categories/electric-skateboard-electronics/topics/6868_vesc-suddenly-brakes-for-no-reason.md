Hey guys, does anyone know why my VESC with RSpec 6355 motor would brake for no reason? Is there a certain setting I should be adjusting on the BLDC Tool? I'm on 4.10HW and 2.15FW. Used the enertion RSpec profile and a original SpaceCell. Never had this problem before my VESC was repaired. Thanks in advance.

Sounds like a motor phase wire short

I forgot where the thread was but Jason and others explained it. You have to open the motor up and insulate the excess copper on the motor phase wires.

I'll search for that thread. I have a new rspec that I can put in  just to be sure it's the very motors problem.
