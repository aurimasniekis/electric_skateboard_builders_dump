They should have provided a schematic of the balance leads, and unfortunately I'm not familiar with the specifics of that Bestech design though, cause it looks like some sort of a split balance connector design.

Also, google turned up nothing on a data sheet for the HCX-D345....I can find it on their website, but no data sheet :(
