```
Im just tiered of looking for lipos and liions...
I have a box in dimensions of 23,5 x 18,5 x 7 cm and im trying to find a battery that will fit inside

Currently I have a 10s4P pack and Im not pleased with the range, so much that Im planning to get a gasoline scooter lol at the price of just the battery for a skate..

But building skates is fun and Im going to go with it

The 12Ah I get now is not enough... Im looking for 20+Ah battery and the only ones who make huge batteries are multistars and their C rating is exaggerated...

Do you have any recommendations?
Maybe something is not on HK, I know some guy bought a HUGE lipo i think from france or something like a smaller firm?

Or I should make a 12s7p pack out of 25r...

```
If i calculate the surface of the box thats 41400mm2 and if I look a 18650 cell as a square and its surface is 18,5 squared that gives me space for 127 cells in the box standing vertically

Thats like a 10P pack right there lol.
Am I doing something wrong here?

I am actually interested in a long range board too,
18650 from the top has 342.25mm2 so the total cells next to each other 120.96 so 12S10P should  be doable but that would be 4.2kg just the pack :D

```
Do not care about the weight, its a trampa board, bare board without any electronics and bindings is like 8-9kg.
So 2x 6374 thats another 2x 850 + 5kg battery with enclosure VESCs, bms, bindings should be another 8kg or so

So 16kg for a board with trucks that count as an handle is pretty okay for me :smiley:

There is this firm which is a bit expensive in UK https://www.overlander.co.uk/ but they batteries are true spec as far as I know.

li ion do **NOT** have a higher discharge than lipo cells.

check these [cells](http://www.batteryspace.com/high-power-polymer-li-ion-cell-3-7v-10-ah-9759156-10c-37wh-100a-rate-ul-listed-un38-3-passed-3-0.aspx)

i my opinion for a high range build you will need lipo cells, because of the stored power.

Find me a 20Ah lipo setup that will fit in the enclosure i have and not cost more than 300$ and be able to deliver 160A constant.

For the lipo cells you linked i would need 1100$+ shipping taxes and whatnot (a little bit too much dont you think?)

Also I would have to solder them and that's a lot messier than just welding a square pack.
Unless there's a "complete" pack out there im going with LiIons

dude what, what motor do you use when you're dragging 160A 

![big-electric-car-motor-small-conversion-21308965|400x300](upload://f8IdulwtkvBI6jnczybvXyFNASK.jpg)

well, since i do not know how much money you're willing to spent i wanted to give you opinions since you said you heard something about a big lipo.

since i not really understand what you are asking for right now, you asked for battery solutions does this mean other cells than 18650 LiIon, or the arrangement of the cells or [...]?

well then do a 12S7P 25R but with these cells you wont have 160A cont. discharge not even 140 because they are rated higher than they can deliver..

1000$ for a battery is just ridiculous  in my opinion.
Also Samsung is know for "underrating" their cells an not over rating them
lygate made a test on them and proven 20A, will do a small research today to know them in the details

Im going to use 2x 6374 Im riding them aggressive at 70A per motor

Im looking for a reasonably prices battery thats big :D
And I probably just found it

"Bottom Line
A true 20A continuous discharge current (CDR) cell with good capacity that runs at moderate temperatures. This cell deserves its good reputation."

do not know what are you reading lol

it says right there its 20A

7x20=140A or in a 8p pack its 160A

yeah true it is 20A my bad i thought it was lower. but above 20A the cell will get extremely hot and will not deliver the power

but you will never ever draw 140A continously.

Im disgusted by even searching for the fucking lipos lol

I would have to get 4 huge lipos to get 20a and 12s
and thats way more expensive and wont fit.
And the only option of 10ah is i think multistar and they suck if i remember well

this is exactly what i said, thank you for that backup.

@Acido you need to accept that the only thing here limiting you is your budget and your thinking of needing 140A continuously you will **NEVER EVER** draw more than 60A cont.

this is a stated fact i already said a while ago since someone on here tested it with different speeds. if youre using 2 X 6374 motors, they will never draw that much, since you absolutely **CANT** handle this power on a 20lbs piece of wood. no one can.

I'm not sure but what I know is that HE said It's so Strong you can do wheelies and as you can see on his beastly ride motor max 64a on Dual, I think his batts could do more than what he pulled Look at the average!

Edit: Average could be miscalculated because he stopped using it for some time.

If your dead set on 160Aish for discharge then forget Li Ion. I can't see that happening.
This might do it: -

Turnigy Graphene 6s (X4): -
18.3 \ 7.7 \ 5.7 CM
10s2p Turnigy Graphene - 3.7 * 12 * 24 = 1065WH

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-graphene-professional-12000mah-6s-15c-lipo-pack-w-xt90.html

Most of the info you need is here: -

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wiring-and-charging-advice-please/26839

Advice against using this kind of setup is fuelled by a healthy fear of LiPo's, which i agree with.

For science, I've charged individually, as well as 2-at-once and all 6 at once with 5s balance lead splitter.
I monitored voltage the entire time across all of the packs and they're better than fine, although i charged all 6 outside :slight_smile:

*my batteries are the Zippy compact 5000 5s

That's insane Charging all that with Imax b6 oh mama-mia. that is very unpractical but Its cool.

That's a 13s4p pack....

Mine is 13s5p and ~40 miles

Both 30q...

Buy 6 of these 
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-graphene-professional-10000mah-4s-15c-lipo-pack-w-xt90.html
and make a 12s2p. That would be 12s20Ah, or 888wh!

Wasnt you talking about 140A? That one will only be able to deliver 90A.. 
Also I think it was @Riako Who has a 1.6kw battery?

The 10a cells should do the job easily

Yes, Ive got 1.78...kWh possible, but not in one pack :blush: Got max 700Wh on board, I like it with 12s12Ah (12s8Ah is a bit to short in range at more than 22Wh/km. 70Amps motor and batt max), but 12s2P16Ah for hiking max, the rest in the backpack (or in the car around the spot). So I can do all the ride I want during a WE far from home without any charge.
Now I got  2.5kWh in stock, all Graphene :zipper_mouth_face: but no board rolling seens 3 months :sob:

You must also take into account how much these cells sag at 10amps, I would say a lot

At 8p they can deliver 10A cont, lets say 15A burst for 5s of the acceleration that's 120A
This should be an equivalent to a 10s4p 30q pack

(at 4.2 it around 2.82kWh)

I love the 18650 compacity and all the configuration you could make from a pack !
but Im so used to lipo, even if it is much heavy and less compact
That is a part of some package :
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rps20171108_141126.jpg?w=720
 ... :smile: some 8 and 12Ah 6s box
The good thing is that with 12s16Ah30c(4x6s8Ah15c) you got so sag problem at all and a really good range !

The amount of amps the can deliver is not how much they will sag. Even the 30q saga when reaching 15/20amps just no as much as other cells, like these ones.

“Bottom Line: This is a 10A 2680mAh-rated battery that will often deliver 100mAh more at low current levels. Due to its very high internal resistance and lower capacity though it is easily outperformed by the Panasonic NCR18650GA, LG MJ1, and other high-capacity 10A batteries. I do not recommend using it over 18W/5A to minimize voltage sag.” Straight from mooch himself and some charts to back it up![image|690x340](upload://x9nexJwPn4OrGKTxYlaQDB1PYrX.jpeg)

The discharge graph shows the cell sagging around 0.7v per cell at a full charge (if I’m reading it correctly, correct me someone if I’m not) now times that by 12 and you’ve got yourself 8.4v of sag at 10amps. Now you could argue that the cell won’t be used at this discharge rate all the time so let’s look at the 5 amp discharge curve.

At 5 amps the cell is sagging around .5v times that by 12 and you have a lovely 6v sag. This sags more than my 20c lipos!

The way I see it is that you would be better off looking at some different cells like the 30q or 25r, or at least look at the cells Mooch mentions in his post about these ones
