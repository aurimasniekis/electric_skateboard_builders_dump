I have 2 focboxes and 2 6380 170kv torqueboard motors. I have also just purchased 4x  6000mah 65c 3s lipos that I plan to run in 12s. My question is do I need to double the battery series amount because i'm running 2 of everything? I've read through the starters battery guide and I don't know if I've just missed that answer but it doesn't seem to be addressed.

No. Run the 4 if them in series to get 12s. Or, if you want to run 6s, put two in series and two in parallel, so you have a 6s2p. Your choice.

make one battery, connect the two controllers in parallel.

sweet. A diagram on trampas website had me confused.I'm guessing doubling the 12s could also be an option?

They just wire it up separately.
With it you can use lipos with lower c-rating.
The lipos you ordered have a good c-rating and a good capacity.
For two focboxes thatâ€™s more than enough if you wire your lipos in series as one pack and than connect your focboxes in parallel to the one pack you made.
