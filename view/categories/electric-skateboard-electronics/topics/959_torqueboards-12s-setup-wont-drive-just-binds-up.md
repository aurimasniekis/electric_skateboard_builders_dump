Hello All!

I believe I may have seen something like this before, reaching out to the community on ideas of what could be up.

So the first time something like this happened everything got fried. This time around I have managed to not fry everything. Basicly what happens is I turn the board on and pull the gt2b trigger, motor just cogs. With the board on its back the wheel just goes forward a bit then lurches back, then forward, etc etc.

When I go to turn off using the cutoff switch it still keeps twitching so i have to unplug the battery. Took everything apart, plugged the battery in and noticed a spark. With a cutoff switch there shouldnt be a spark so this arose some worries. The motor off of its belt and trigger pulled, she stutters but spins up. 

Not sure what just happened but putting everything back together now. Going to space things out some more in hopes that the cutoff switch just got hot from a heavy ride. Last time this happened to me it was a heavy ride that I had just got done with when this happened. May not be a problem with the ESC but the cutoff switch itself... hhhmmmmmmmm

I doubt it has anything to do with the antispark switch, do you have another ESC to test with?

I have 3 VESCs that i had gotten from you onloop. Thinking it might be time to give up on torqueboards as a backup board that can take the beating. Will have to wait a few more days for the bullet connectors to come in from hobby king so i can get that straightened up. Hopefully can get one of these kama controllers working. But now i need an anti spark switch that i can trust.

With everything taken apart i plugged the battery in and everything powered right up. This cutoff switch isnt doing anything basicly. This is laaammmmeeeeee.

EDIT: with everything put back together, while the cutoff switch isnt doing anything I did manage to get the motor to spin proper. No idea how I did it, but I just got off a test run and it seems to be working fine? Gonna have to get an antispark switch as some backup. Odd times!!!!

Is the cutoff switch one of Touqueboard's too?

Yeppers. 12s esc and 14s cutoff switch both from torqueboards.

It sounds like this isn't your main problem but I had the same issue with my Tourqeboards power switch where it didn't actually break the circuit when switched off. I sent it back about two months ago and am still awaiting a replacement.

I bought one of those switches too and straight out of the packaging it never worked. It's in my pile of disenchantment. Doubt I'll ever send it back.

I decided to just roll with XT90 antispark plugs and a loop key. Simple, bomb proof and inexpensive.

Damn I was hoping I was the only one. I loved the way it looked when it was all lit up blue. Enertion seems to sell a [similar one too][1] (hopefully works better) but it's out of stock. @onloop do you expect to get those back in stock sometime?

I permanently boycotted the factory that makes them....

@Sharkface - PM me and we can get that worked out.

@Siggs3000 - I'll PM you and send a replacement.

Yeah, unfortunately the factory that makes them uses crap mosfets and I even offered to pay more to use better mosfets but to no avail.

I'll be testing out Ben's as it's a more proper on/off switch for those who still use Lipo.

Yyeaahhhh.... ill be talking to you about that one soon....

And in regards to bad FETs @torqueboards... maybe you should find a more reliable company/manufacturer... unless im the only one readin your last post as "i knowingly sold under par parts"

You could also get the manufacturer to do better crimping on the servo connectors that @evoheyax and I had problems with.

I don't want to be all "I told you so" but this thread is full of the exact reasons that I will only use a physical breaker switch on my boards.

I dunno. safety and stuff.

I got my HV electronic switch from Torque Boards yesterday. Tested it right off and it works perfectly.
Not even a trace of spark when connecting 12s battery.
There is a slight delay when turning it on and when turning it off, it takes about a second for the circuit to drain out.( I can live with that.)
I tried using a mechanical breaker switch before and it wore out quickly. When I took it apart I found that the contact points where fried. 12s produces a heavy spark and a mechanical switch doesn't  eliminate spark it just relocates it to the points in the switch.

If you had used an xt90 anti spark plug with your breaker it wouldn't have worn out.

@Sharkface - I wouldn't say it's sold under par parts. I have tons of boards and each uses the same on/off switch and it works perfectly fine.

More so it's the way people connect it and burn out the mosfets.

However, I am working on offering a higher quality option.

@lox897 - I'll take a look at those. Thanks for the heads up.

I've also used the BreakerSwitches and my first one lasted like 6 months and all the ones after ended up breaking within less than a month. Tested about 3 more after the first and gave up on them. But yeah, as @psychotiller mentioned. I'm pretty sure it was do the spark.

I like to use 5.5 bullet connectors because there handy when running batteries in series and charging them separately.
this way I don't need to use a series cable adapter. I also like the clean look of the electronic switch board and wires concealed inside the battery case with a flush mount button. I respect your opinion favoring the mechanical switch.
As to the reliability of the electronic switch, I'll have to wait and see.
The mechanical switch that I was using didn't fail because of the arcing. The spring bar became weak and allowed the points to loose connection intermittently. It was a scorpion brand 120amp. Perhaps a heavier breaker like a 250 would have held up better.

"people" as in the  manufacturer and not people as in your purchasers is my guess?

Just wanted to followup on my comment on this topic. 

@torqueboards reached out to me and replaced my switch with a tested and working one. I received it and even got some help from him in a PM convo in setting it up. Then I cross wired things and melted another VESC and the switch but that's obviously on me :anguished:

I appreciate the good customer service and wanted to make sure I sent a proper shoutout after making the public bitching comment. Case closed for me.

DoH :flushed:

I'm working on upgrading these switches soon as well. So will have a new one shortly that will be much better.

Dood thanks for the reminder, I will follow suit with @siggs3000 here in saying @torqueboards def deserves a positive shout out.

After just bypassing the switch itself I have been rolling on that for about a month now. I still get the random motor cogging/bind/whatever but now it really only happens when I dont kick off. As that is 100% expected this problem is solved. I still disconnect everything so the ESC doesnt sit there twitching, but again I was kinda the point of failure there, so maybe i should just fix it myself. 

Furthermore the 12S ESC from @torqueboards has taken a BEATING yet it still works. Between acceleration at stand still causing the bind ups, pulling the acceleration faster than the motor can handle, using a 20T - 36T pulley configuration, riding it in the rain until the gt2b reciever unit is flooded and stops working, and riding it 5+ miles a day. Anybody who rides a bus and looks at the DIY 12S ESC as "expensive" should read this: I have paid for the boards current parts by simply not taking the bus daily. Imagine how long this ESC were to last if you did the opposite of all those things I just listed, that I do on the regular?
