Hey guys

I wonder how I can remove the Hall sensor from this motor ?

I can't figure out how to get the strangely looking aluminiumplate in front of it removed.
Anyone have a clue ?

What brand of motor is it? can't you desolder them and just pull them out?
Why do you want to remove them? :o (broken and replace?)

The PCB is held down by the aluminum part.. The PCB has a round hole but as you see that part is holding down the PCB and I tried to turn it - pull it put it didn't move. Its a Maytech Motor

Ok. Figured it out.
There is a thread on this aluminum part.
Took some force to open it. 
It's done now
