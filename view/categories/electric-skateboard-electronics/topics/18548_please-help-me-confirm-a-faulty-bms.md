Hey guys, can anyone confirm with me if this BMS is faulty? Reason why I suspect it is that the balance lead connector port appears to be displaced. Instead of going from B1-B10, it spans from B2-B11, as shown in the pictures.

I've already connected the unit to my 10S pack and the voltmeter measured no output so I am assuming this is the culprit. If anyone has knowledge on BMS, please confirm it with me. 

Thanks in advance

The silkscreen is offset/displaced

thanks Sander, yeah I didn't notice that they were offset and displaced, which makes the configuration correct B1-B10. Also, it's working now! There was a bad wire in one of the battery leads

This is eventually what I want to build to replace all faulty BMS'es [1] 

TL;DW: using a hobby charger you can wire all the cells individualy for charging, and little voltage alarms used in RC for a constant read [2]. this can triple your battery pack life, especially if it's made out of salvaged laptop batteries.

Hi
My batteries not discharging properly and I think its an issue with the BMS.  Attached image shows the card and a close up of a 1m chip out of alignment.  Is this a defect?  The supplier says its not.

I new so, can only post one image.  Its column B11+ (see the brand name text.  Go 3 down 3 across and theres the tiny offset chip)
