Hola!
I want to deck swap and get smaller motors for my meepo board. I was thinking about some 70mm or 80mm hub motors from maytech, and a VESC, what would be the best VESC for this build? I will keep the same meepo mini 2 standard battery. Also, if looked on the website  but I think their NR remote isnt universal, so I'll probably have to get a new remote too.

The nr remote isnâ€™t universal 

The vesc is up to you based on your budget and what you require from it

By the looks of it maytech or flipsky seem the best option
