Hi!

Looking for a bms for a 10s4p Samsung 25r battery pack. 
I found this on ebay  http://m.ebay.com/itm/36V-37V-42V-10S-60A-Lithium-ion-Li-ion-Li-Po-LiPo-Polymer-Battery-BMS-PCB-System-/221769582503
Would it work? Or do anyone know where to get one in europe?

(Vesc + 190kv motor). Will upgrade to dual motors in the feature

Regards/ Robin

Thanks mate!
Could you also recommend a voltmeter that shows Voltage instead of battery %
Those I find is ment for 30v or less

they sell the Bestech BMS.

@L3chef not tried this one yet but looks cool.  Shows voltage and % on two separate displays.  For up to 80V

If your going to do a group buy, You might want to consider the Bestech bms.
They are head and shoulder above Battery Supports
A 10s/80a with built in E-switch is only $49 + shipping and I believe they have a facility in Germany.

I've heard that supower > bestech because bestech bms:es are prone to breaking.

I've been using Bestech on 2 builds for months and have had no issues at all.
The Bestech come with heatsinks on the FET's and heat sensors.
They can handle up to 240a burst.
Their Balance current is double what Battery Supports does so they balance twice as fast

They also allow you to fine tune adjustable parameters during the order process.
Basically, they are a custom ordered bms. Still there delivery time is relatively fast.

I'm holding off a bit in this, because I might buy a ready-made battery.

Also looking for a BMS, 2x 5S 5000 mah llipo here. Batterysupports is to expensive for me, shipping to to the Netherlands is €80+. I'm very new to the world of battery charging, Connecting Bestechpower's bms into my setup would be the same as the one from Batterysupports? Don't see any details about that on the product page ( http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html )
```

Sure, good idea. 

Does anyone knows where to buy a charger like [this](http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-42v-5a-lithium-ion-battery-charger-10s-10x-36v-lion-lipo-p-166.html) in Europe?

Does anyone know if SuPower Battery (batterysupports.com) customizes BMS parameters as of recent?

Because I have asked them on eBay and Lilian answered that they cannot do that

> sorry, we cant do that..

Which I find weird because what I read here around forums contradicts that :confused:
