Im looking into vesc options for my mountainboard build, planning to make a 12s6p battery and will probably get 6374 170kv maytech motors. Dont want to get a unity because of the waiting time and the fault it has. Double vesc6 is too expensive imo im looking for a setup of max 300 euros preferably around 200-250. Suggestions are welcome thanks!

flipsky single or dual vesc6 based escs. they ok and avialable right now.
You can always start a call out for used VESC6 or focboxes. Maybe somebody want to sell his. 

Pro tip: try that in the other place as well ;)
