I've only had my raptor for a month and have a multitude of battery problems. Right now no matter how long I charge it it only shows 27% charge. And when I try to ride it it just surge's and tries to take off even if I'm not touching the remote. Any thoughts?

does the LED on the charger turn red when charging? could be a broken charge wire port or a busted bms.

Yes it does turn red. I used my buddy's battery while I was waiting for mine to get here and all was good. I've had nothing but problems every since I put my battery in.
