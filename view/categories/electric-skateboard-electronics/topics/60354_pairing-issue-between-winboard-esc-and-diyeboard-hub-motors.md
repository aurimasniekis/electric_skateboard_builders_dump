I recently fried my ESC from a DIYEboard kit. I managed to find a replacement ESC second hand from Winboard but for some reason the motors won't run unless I plug in the hall sensor wires. The other weird thing is that the motor gets really loud with the hall sensor wires plugged in and the ESC shuts off after a couple minutes of use. (I'll try to upload pictures and videos when I get back home)

Parts in use:
- Battery: DIYEboard 10s3p 6.6Ah
- Hub-motor: DIYEboard 83 mm
- ESC: Winboard

Any help would be appreciated!
