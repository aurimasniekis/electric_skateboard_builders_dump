i'm not a programmer , nor a hardware engineer .not even a technician . i see myself as a handy man .
i'd like to introduce to our esk8 enthusiasts a new probable eboard controller .
be ready for order end of nov 2016 . (sigh*)
i found a new device in youtube and techinsider .
i wonder if it could be use as an eboard controller .
i see many engineers and programmers here in forum , can some one hack and add a bluetooth connection to this device to pair with and eboard ?


move forward ?    point index finger
reduce speed ?    all 5 fingers straight 
brakes ?              hold a fist
switch off ?          snap a finger

just program the Gest device .
i believe that it is a bluetooth device . and we need a bluetooth receiver to command the VESC .
what do you think ?
is it possible ?
once its in market , i'm getting me one , maybe 3 . since the last time , i bought myself 3 kamas (2 for reserve if one is spoilt)
