After reading lots of posts and threads about TB vescs dying Id like to make a collection of the points of VESC failure
I personally have one but still didnt try it out 
I already checked with my naked eye wich doesnt really understand all of the VESC and didnt find any mistakes, can you older more experienced guys point out some points of failure?

I've never had a TB vesc, but for circuit boards in general, you can check:

Little tiny solder balls shorting out 2 pins on the chips.  (use a jeweler's loupe)
