I already googled a lot, but I cant find the newest firmware or BLCD software online.
Most topics refer to a website which does not longer exists. 

How can I get, and install, the latest firmware on my Vedder BLCD Vesc version 4.12?
Currently running the stock software.
The VESC was bought at DIY Electric Skateboard.

Download the vesc_default.bin file and upload with whatever tool you have.
