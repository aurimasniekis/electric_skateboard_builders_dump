Around 50bucks and you can get ad decent soldering station. This is really not hard to do with the right tools.
[For example](https://m.ebay.com/itm/75W-110-265V-Power-Electric-Soldering-Station-SMD-Rework-Welding-Iron-Holder-Set/372216868611?hash=item56a9daaf03:g:L4gAAOSwlzRafBdi)

I got a 50w station from Aldi for like 11$ and it works really good for the past 6 months

I agree, it’s fun and it’s good to learn how to solder if ur doing this type of thing. However, offer still stands

For a while I bought the cheap solder irons.  Just grind tips and replace.  They make good foam cutters now
