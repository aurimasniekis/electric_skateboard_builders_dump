Can anyone point me in the right direction to modify the sensitivity of the remote throttle curve. 

My board is a 12s setup wih dual jackb hub motors and it reaches max power when im only pressing like 25% of the throttle. Basically i hit top speed at 25% throttle leaving most of the throttle range useless and causing some unexpected rapid acceleration some times.

Ackmaniac modified the VESC firmware and tool to add a throttle curve -

If you have the Enertion Nano X it's really difficult ti set it up with good throttle response
