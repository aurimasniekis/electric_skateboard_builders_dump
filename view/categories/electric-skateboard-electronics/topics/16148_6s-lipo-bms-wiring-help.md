Normally you have a balance plug which you can connect to the bms. the balance plug with the balance wires can be seen on the left in white:

Or get rid of the red and black and just use the main power leads depends on how you want to bypass the bms for discharge

You can just cut off the positive and negative wires from the balance plug. You will then use the thick wires as positive and negative. I hope that helps
