This will be my full review of the Maytech 90mm Hub Motors, Maytech Branded VESC and accompanying rear hub motor truck. I havent seen many very comprehensive reviews of the Maytech Hub Motors so I thought id post my results. I contacted Maytech on August 8 and ordered them on the 9th through Eileen at Maytech who was very nice and replied very quickly A+ on that so far. On August 22 they shipped from China and got delivered via UPS today, 2 day shipping! At first glance the packaging was great, box with bubble wrap and everything within its own box, except the truck, it was just covered in bubble wrap, which was fine. The hub motor came in at 1014g, and with the truck 1450g. In comparison to my Carvon Single Hub which weighs 1690g, though thats with another normal wheel as well. The hub looks ok so far, only thing that snot great is where the wires come out of the hub theres this kind of black goop thats spread over it and just kinda looks messy. Other than that not to bad, onto the VESC. The VESC actually looks quite nice so far though the DRV is slightly crooked , the soldering looks pretty good and the parts look legit though that doesn't mean much lol. The truck looks ok, it doesnt way much and doesnt feel very high quality compared to the Carvon one, though it will suffice. Overall first impressions are pretty good and ill either update this post or add a reply once ive done a teardown of the hub and tested everything on my board, stay tuned!

EDIT: The hubs are advertised as 60KV though it's more realistically around 85-90KV because I got upto 20MPH on only 6S.

## **Update #3**

So I've finally finished installing the hubs and got to test them out! Right off the bat I noticed the **crazy torque, acceleration and braking power** these sensored hubs have compared to my single drive Carvon V2! These motors are also incredibly quite, I mean dead silent compared to my Carvon thanks to im guessing the sensors. So far these hubs seem to be equally as efficient as my Carvon hub estimating about 12-13 miles of range though I will do a full drain test ride to find out. Onto the heat and current ratings of these motors because that seemed to be a big concern for many people. So far these have handled really well, I have max motor current set to 50A and it only draws around 16A at full throttle cruising though when accelerating hard it will draw a solid 50A or 60A for just a few seconds. After riding 2 miles at full throttle and starting and stopping a few times the motor only reached a max of 48C though I will see how it fairs doing longer runs. I personally dont have any hills near me so i haven't had a chance to test the hill climbing ability though when I do ill update about that as well. 

**Now onto some of the cons of these hubs**, which there aren't many of. Biggest one for me personally, is speed. At full throttle these only got me upto a max of around 20mph according to my GPS. Now I am only riding these at 6S so I think at 12S you could get upto possibly 30mph though im going to work on going faster with my current setup. Compared to my Carvon which got me upto 32mph these are pretty slow. Speed is definitely the biggest problem with these for me though the acceleration, torque and quietness will definitely help out weigh that for some people. Though for me I really like going fast and I was hoping to get past 32, possibly closer 40 which simply will not be happening with these motors. Alright im going to move onto some smaller gripes I have about these motors and then ill wrap it up. First of all I didnt realize it, but that phase leads on these hubs are way to long, like even if they were half there length I think it would still be a bit much, definitely need to reduce the length of them because they take up a bunch of space inside my enclosure.  Other than that I guess there isnt much else that I haven't covered before like the black goop around where the leads come out of the motors which I still think is pretty crappy. All in all I think these are pretty good motors for the price, especially for people who dont want to go very fast, but want good acceleration and overall a board that feels nice to ride.
Below are some pics of the board as well as my VESC settings.

**I also took a ride with Ackmaniac's VESC Monitor app overlay and it can be found on YouTube, [HERE](https://youtu.be/Y-XAAU8Q0YU)**

Everything that I hear about these are bad... So it'd be interesting to hear something to the contrary.

From my experience, those stators are simply too small. Around the same size as hummies v1 and v2 motors. They will overheat if you push too many amps. And with my size (200 lb) and hills, I don't think they will last very long.

You should add the most important part, how they ride,how long till they overheat on a hill, maybe something about efficiency, motor noise ect. This was like more of an unboxing review, just my 2 cents.

@evoheyax yeah I can imagine that though I only weigh like 130lbs and there aren't any hills near where I live so I guess we'll see! 

@Rinzler  yeah it was only supposed to be an unboxing review cause I haven't had a chance to install or test them yet, once I do I'll update the post with far more details.

Problem with these vesc is that for some reason drv gets hotter than fets. So u might need to heatsink the drv too.

Hmm, I'm guessing cause there not legit DRV's and they are less efficient then. I'll heatsink it as well, and if I have any problems I'll just replace it cause I have a few DRV chips leftover from a friend's VESC repair.

What makes a vesc be considered 'upgraded'? Heatsinks only?

I have this same vesc I believe, bought from eskating.eu. Haven't had the opportunity to test it since some essential parts are in the mail.

@GunnarK I think  @Namasaki means upgraded components like the Ollin VESCs with larger ceramic caps and some just different parts. 

@jotatsu fake DRV's or other fake components usually mean that there bought from a company that either sometimes reuses recycled chips, makes there own, but either with smaller dies or just in a cheaper way that makes them less efficient, reliable and all around worse than genuine parts or just re label different chips as being a better one than they a actually are, I've had that quite a few times. Once tried to order some HV-LM2596 Buck Converter IC's from AliExpress for really cheap and they where just re labeled normal 2596's that popped above 40V when they were supposed to reach 60V. Long story short just order important parts like MOSFET's or IC's from legit sellers like Mouser Digikey or my preferred place Arrow.com.

Not just heat sinks. 
Upgraded components. 
Ollin Vescs have upgraded components 
Axle Vescs have upgraded components 
Enertion Focboxes have upgraded components.
These are more reliable than the versions you get from China.

Ok but the Chinese versions are reliable enough for belt-drive systems?
Of course, one can always do better..

Well reliability is more on the side of how long they'll last than if they can be used for a belt drive system. Anyways yeah you could obviously do better than these VESC's but they should definitely work for a belt drive.

```
The thing here is i dont see how that works. The chip is 5-6 usd in aliexpress and in mouser, even in alibaba are 4-5 in bulk, so no chinese version i can see is cheaper than original new one. If one says its a clone it's probably the same factory or factories as the original one, because taping a new chip aint easy or cheap,  even if you somehow stole the layout. I've seen for example pin compatible smt32 or ftdi clones, but the market of those vs the drv8302 is orders of magnitude different. 

Maybe, maybe  the used chips have some validity. Have anyone been able to identify "fake" drv8302? how?

it could be silicone lottery, they may be grade the chips for Grade A pass or B pass, and sell it to different vendors, it's very common in china.

@jotatsu yeah that's a good point, but like @onepunchboard said they could be doing that as well. Theres also a lot of other factors that go into how hot the IC gets, for example maybe there using some sort of cheaper PCB material that doesn't conduct heat as well, idk.

**Update #1**

In the first post I said I was going to disassemble the hub motor though in my attempt to take it apart I stripped two of the 3M screws on each side of the hub. It seems that there held in with some sort of very strong thread lock so im just going to leave it be. Thankfully though this guy did a great review of the 90mm Hubs [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpEv3Hr-U9E&t=1s).

I also tested the hub with the Maytech VESC and everything worked very well there the sensors are very nice and I can tell how they affect acceleration, cant wait to test them out! Sadly the Maytech VESC's have no boot loader so you have to install the boot loader onto them with an ST Link V2 which I bought for like $5 off eBay. Once I do that ill update the firmware to Ackmaniacs 2.54v like my Enertion VESC, hook them up over CAN and hopefully get the whole thing going! Anyways below is a pic of the hubs installed on the truck.

EDIT: Also I need to make a JST 1.5mm pitch to 2mm pitch sensor adapater cause the VESC only came with one and I obviously need two for both motors on each VESC. Ordered the parts off Arrow and they should be here shorty.

## **Update #4**

Big news, reconfigured my 6S2P pack into a 12S1P at 5Ah and WOW does this thing fly! I've gotten upto **35MPH** and wow does it feel like it. However the downside is its **incredibly inefficient**, im talking 30A battery current at full throttle compared to the 6-8A cruising at 20-25mph. To be fair these motors arent meant for more than 10S and I knew that going into this. I also noticed that the torque, acceleration and braking power is not as strong as it was at 6S so thats another downside I didn't expect. I also changed some of my motor settings like going from Sensored to **Hybrid** mode which I highly recommend doing as its way more efficient at high speeds, I cant even imagine the current draw in sensored mode at full throttle. Overall im happy I swapped to 12S even though my range and acceleration will be a bit reduced. Below are some pics of the new and organized(ish) internals and pics of my settings.

I just bought these from banggood for $ 140.00 .  They look almost identical and I will dissassemble and compare them to the pics @kaspars posted.  I am under the impression that these come from whatever factory is making these hubs for Maytech and at $ 140 for a set of hubs, a regular truck and two 90 mm wheels, I'll take the gamble.

do these come in multiple sizes besides 90mm?

what would be the best size to get in terms of speed, lifespan, and overheating especially etc... is bigger always better..

also what is the contact patch of these? do they have different models with different contact patches? 

im designing a 3d model in autodesk inventor... of dual hub motor trucks i want to use with these... i want it to have AN EXTREMELY TIGHT HANGER WIDTH (think penny board) and i want to put it on a TINY deck... and fit in a backpack...

the problem is i need the front wheels to line up properly and i need to figure out the hanger width difference on the front and rear trucks because the regular wheels the hanger and axle nut will be somewhat recessed into the wheel while on the maytech wheels the hanger and nut will be flush on both sides... so i need to know the different possible contact patch sizes

```
sounds like a challanging project/ride

It that depends on the kv rating, e.g. these are rated 70kv, at on 10S = ~3000rpm with a diameter of 90mm it should result in ~43 km/h unloaded, more like ~36km/h (source http://calc.esk8.it, motor pully = wheel pully [1:1 ratio] )

These wheels get quite warm, but i can imagine that larger wheels (more metal) will dissipate it better

My non-electric board originally had 70mm wheels, these trucks dropped right in.

If you are planning battery in a backpack make sure the powerleads are of sufficient awg, imo there can be quite a voltage drop example 
2,5m wire at 42v@60A (best case)
 8awg: 30W loss
10awg: 51W loss
12awg: 76w loss
14awg: 122W loss
16awg: 204W loss
...

i think im gonna go with the 90mm maytech hubs... and ill have to get 90mm "analog" wheels lol...

the maytech website says the 90mm hubs are 55mm wide... 

is that the actual contact patch? or is it something else... can somebody that owns these measure just the PU tire width... and also just the width of the little metal nub that juts out and clamps onto the truck hanger... 

basically 

PU tire width + metal thing width = full width... 

or am i wrong and are the two metal faces of the wheel completely flush with the PU tire? i know the front face is but cant tell for the part that hits the truck hanger...


also no i wont be using a battery in a backpack... just everything attatched to the deck... if i get 7-12 miles ill be happy

I think these pictures cover your questions. Let me know if I can get anything else for you.

Including the metal thing.

epic... 

what is meant by screw to screw... i guess you mean the litttle screws that hold the face plates in place... i guess they seem to add a milimeter or so on each side... or by screw did you mean the axle bolt which i dont really need to know about... 

and it seems like the extra sticking out part on the truck hanger side adds about 3 mm

Correct, screw to screw is the little face plate screw on either side. They add a little bit so I figured I would include that.

Those (maytech?) urethanes (pu sleve) look much better than my aliexpress ones (they are really soft and already matt and scarred after the first ride). can you measure the inner diameter? since the wheels look the same, they might fit my wheels

Yes they are maytech.

it looks like maytech just came out with a new design... now their stock 90mm hub motors all have a different face plate and are higher kv.... 100kv instead of whatever you all have... also the little metal bump out where the square hole is... is now rounded and a curved bump out... apparently also has different guts... maytech people told me this personally... the main question to think about is WHETHER THE OLD ONES ARE BETTER.. LOWER KV MEANS MORE TORQUE... SPEED IS NOT AN ISSUE FOR ME AFTER 15MPH I DONT CARE...

From the Aliexpress page they say both current and voltages are same (22A/10S) - there is no way they have same or more start torque than the previous 60kV models, or am I missing something totally? 

What will be the listing price of those tho?

bear in mind that a lot of these aliexpress adn alibaba pages have wrong information... i got all this info from talking to a sales rep.. im no expert but apparently its got different kV... im not even sure what that means tbh... 

these motors are 36v no? and i bought the standard maytech VESC... so would a basic 10s2p lithium ion battery be compatible with my setup? and what is the story with the C rating.. will i fry my battery with these motors?

you would fry you battery, or over discharge it, if the esc is taking more amps from your battery than the battery can comfortably put out.  10s2p could be good enough if they are high discharge cells or you set the esc to only take so much from them.  the motor isnt the issue.

This has been talked about before, but those are not legit maytech hubs as they have a lower kv and also look slightly different. However I'm not sure if anyone has tested those and seen how they perform compared to other hubs. Nonetheless if you get them please do let us know how they perform!

they look exactly the same as the ones I ordered last year from [L-FASTER](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Electronic-Longboard-Hub-Motor-Kit-Skateboard-Brushless-Motor-Wheel-With-Truck-Electric-Board-Dual-Motor-Drive/632724_32807492704.html) on aliexpress (with dual ESC and remote)

But quality whise they are okay, plenty of torque, the rubber is soft and chips easilly, I ordered a set of spare tires just in case they where not available anymore in 1~2years
