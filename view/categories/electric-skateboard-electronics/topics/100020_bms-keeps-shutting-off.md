Hi,

I just finished changing my bypassed bms to a 60A bms (bestech d596). When i started the testing it suddenly stopped working.
I had just calibrated the motors and accelerated without standing on it. (Wheels up)
My unity was also set to max 60A.

Now i can't get the bms working again. I disconnected the power leads and turned the e-switch off and on but it won't work. I tried to make it work without the power connected and instead just measure the voltage with a multimeter but i only get constant 10V and 40V for a second each time.

I checked the bms and wiring for faults but i can't find any.
Also when i keep pushing the unity's power button while turning on the bms it works but i hear a clicking sound coming from the battery. (Not quite like a spark sound)
