No matter what receiver i use, both my focboxes will not seem to work!?!? Worked fine last night and this morning, the remote connects but nothing works.... even when i am on the vesc app, i get no activity from my remote. ![image|374x500](upload://69CrI4VgQ9XKSuzKeKEFkgUHfjk.jpeg)

Check the ppm wires on the focboxes. More times than not, I've had the solder joints break.

I actually took out the focboxold school vesc x so now im using a servo cable. Actually got it to work by loading the default settings..... i guess i had accidentally pressed or changed something. Gonna check the solder points on the focbox now
