I just bought this set. For 386 dollars. Not complaining about that at all btw.  Since it is an ESC and not a VESC i dont need to go trough the hassle of programming it. Personally since this is my first shot at an E-board. Also not complaining. What i do want to know is. How much amps does the ESC feed to the hub motors on high and low frequency? I did some research on batteries on this site. And it seems that this determines the speed but also the range. I kinda wanna calculate how many Ah im gonna need to get where i want to go. The speeds are predetermined by the ESC as it is. So what are the speeds? This info i think will help me out alot in purchasing a battery for this set-up. In any ways i'll get the chance to test it either way when my purchase arrives anyways. If anyone has the answers to these questions that be super duper.

1 How many amps are given to the motors by the ESC ?
2 What are the speeds in correlation to these amps in this set-up?
3 How many Ah do i need for a 20km radius? ( i can calculate that if i had more info)

Thx in advance a customer awaiting its product and buying batteries soon.
