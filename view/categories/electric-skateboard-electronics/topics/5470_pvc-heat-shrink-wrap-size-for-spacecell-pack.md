Hey guys, I blew up my BMS and had to open up the pack. Can you battery building proficient masters let me know what size to get for the Enertion Spacecell pack? Here's some pictures of the current pack's status. Thanks in advance!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/50b29f31e561396b08ee867d1f62ba220b4d98b3.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/813bd7ab17535a891eb6ab2f91d4950b3106ebce.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I believe it's 150mm heat shrink tubing that will work for a dual row of 18650s without the trays.

150mm can someone confirm?

150 should do it, yeah. But to be safe you might want to go 160 or 170 if you have a gap in between your rows like i do. I only shrink the rows though, not the whole pack.

Thanks @longhairedboy. I'm looking to rewrap my entire pack though and I think this is sufficient?

Flat diameter: 322mmRound diameter: approx.205mmWall thickness: 0.12mm (Before shrinkage)

I believe in Enertion's site that the width is about 203mm. Please someone correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks guys and hope you all had an awesome 4th of July!

Did you ever find the correct wrap size and where did you buy it from? Looking to rewrap my entire SpaceCell and possibly install a new Vedder Anti-spark soft on/off switch. Preferably one that glows and moves top to bottom, instead of forward and backward

Hey! I just got back to the esk8 scene and sorry for the delay. I have yet to get the shrinkwrap and rework my own spacecell. Please do let me know and post some pics when yours is ready! What happened to your SpaceCell? Good luck!
