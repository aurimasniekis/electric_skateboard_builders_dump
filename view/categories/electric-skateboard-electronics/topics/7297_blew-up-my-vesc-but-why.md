The red cable seems punctured by the pins near the edge of the pcb where the burn mark is, is this the case? Maybe that could have caused a short?

Really don't know .... It was sealed in the heat shrink and couldn't see anything wrong but it ended up blown itself....  :frowning2:

That left pin above your burned component definitely punctured your red supply cable. 
I would suggest to everyone cutting all extruding pins from the bottom of the pcb ( or hotglue over it)

You mean it inserts into the red cable that's why got shorted?
Then how long can I cut the extruding pins? All way to pcb?

I'm sure there must be an entry hole right in the bend of the red cable.
You can cut them as low as possible all the way to the PCB.

It's usually the sensor connector that's puncturing the supply leads, but there was a fair warning on revisioning your enertion VESC's over here, If you  have the platinum warranty vesc I'm sure enertion will cover it...

Yeah, I know it sucks. I guess it's just part of the general RC hobby. Sometimes you blow stuff up... You should be running again within 2 weeks. Enertion should have plenty of VESC stock. Ask them to send an extra crimp foil, so you can remove it, cut the pins and wrap it again.

Remember that enertion is not a polished big company, but a guy now with a small team, working out of his garage. He's publicly stated he gets more emails than he could answer if he sits at his computer the entire day every day. He also has a newborn and a wife to take care of, so that's made the situation even worse. I believe he's doing what he can, but he has way more work than he can do, and it takes time to hire the right people.

This lack of communication is one reason I don't buy enertion. That, and my terrible experience with enertion vescs breaking in less than 2 days (and the other came broken). I was blamed for breaking them, and was given no solution but to buy a new one at full price.

Since the warning has been out there, you will likely not get them replaced unless you had bought the platinum. And they don't offer a repair service, so be ready to buy a new one and learn from this mistake (which was really a manufacturers mistake). My solution is: buy from chaka. they are of a better quality, he makes them in house himself, if anything breaks ever, he will fix them for free or at the little cost of components. Never throw away a vesc again because you have nowhere's to turn to fix it.

[/quote]

After reading too many of these types of threads where honest people are getting substandard product, I cannot buy Enertion. It goes against all good judgement. There is just not enough support for the product and the product doesn't seem to be quality controlled. Those pins sticking up should never have been acceptable. Enertion VESC are supposed to be IPC2 standard, but I am not confident that this standard is being adhered to. 
I buy Ollinboardco VESC because of the higher standard and quality control. http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/vedder-s-speed-controller
Chaka is a small business too, but he has his shit together and provides the highest quality possible. 12 month service warranty included!! Isn't that the advantage of being small? So that you CAN provide great customer service. Enertion is a classic example of a company that scaled up too quickly without sufficient infrastructure to support itself.
 Dexter@ diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/ is really stepping up as well. You can buy the additional 1 year warranty and still be competitively priced with OBC.I don't see any failure threads for his VESC either.
If you are in the EU, then I hear that Elkick is the man for the job.. http://www.esk8.de/shop

Did you buy the vesc with a 12 months replacement warranty? If so we send you another vesc instantly.

If not you need to return it to the factory in the USA and wait for them to confirm the fault.

If you have doubts call MacroFab yourself and ask them about their facility and manufacturing standards. But don't come here say the the product and service is substandard because a handful of people have problems. I sell hundreds of vesc each month and there are not hundreds of faults each month. 

If chaka sold vesc for $99usd the service would be horrible too and he wouldn't repair or iffer replacement parts for free... why do you not understand that?

Every enertion vesc is powered up and loaded with firmware. Every enertion vesc has passed a motor spin test. If you have a fault at home it's likely due to a new factor that has occurred after it left the factory.

We offer a product with a 12 months instant replacement warranty at an extremely competitive price (less than chaka). If someone decides to buy the standard $99 version and they have issues they need to take a slower path to resolve their issues... I guarantee all my customers who paid for the premium service get exceptional service. The ones that do not pay for the service get less priority..  can you understand this principle?

I ran a poll on this exact topic.... some people said they want cheap and less service. Some people said they would pay more for premium service...

What am I meant to do? Stop selling the $99 version? Give the people who pay less the same service as those who pay more???

I'm happy to get some advice here...

Beyond the fact that Enertion by current accounts literally works out of a garage it's barely a "garage operation". The sales volumes that are thrown around by onloop would suggest that Enertion should easily turn over multi millions, so really what excuse is there for the heavily reported poor service?

@onloop 
You asked for advice. Here is my personal opinion for you.
The VESC is an open source/hardware project. I spent many years in that scene and worked with open projects alot. Linux, Ardupilot, Pixhawk. To name just a few. 
I have never ever seen anybody supplying an open hardware product and giving any sort of guarantee on it. Not even close to what you're or ollin board and who not are doing. There is a doa replacment and thats about it...
I personally lost an amount of money that I will never ever in my while life calculate, for the total insanity of it, due to software bugs, faulty implementation and combinations of that. I never asked the developers or suppliers for money back. One just does not do that in this scene. 
The VESC is much more a devboard/OEM then a product for the mass market and that right here is the mistake you made. You took it as being ready for the mass market and added a service that is to good to be true on top of that! 
I personally would sell the 99$ version without any guarantee besides that use them in the controlled environment of the raptor but deny any guarantee as soon as somebody makes any changes to the software/settings like every manufacturer does.
Have a look at Adafruit or Sparkfuns terms and conditions. They sell lots of open hardware/source stuff. 

To anyone else out there, I'm in no way affiliated with Enertion and never have or intend to buy from them. I'm a DIY guy and for this particular project it means I design and make my own motorholders, build my own VESC and my own transmitter. Because making it is to me more fun then riding it and riding something I made completely myself is a feeling that can't be beaten. Heck, I'm even working on making my own hubmotors from scratch.

Well yeah... I agree... 

but try to explain that to these kids that save up all their pocket money to buy the vesc and then blow it up..... they get really upset and need to blame someone.

Our terms and conditions clearly state that it's not covered under certain use cases... people will still complain though.

Now...The platinum vesc warranty is legit though.... if your shit breaks you get a new one... simple as that.

We are able to offer this because of a simple calculation on failure rates.... we know about 3% of people will fuck their vesc up somehow.... the problem is it seems most of the people who fuck their vesc didn't buy the one with the warranty...

I will definitely make it more clear on the website that we are not responsible for it once it has been modified.

[/quote]

This is a great question... I'm glad you asked..

First, have you run your own business before? Because if you haven't you clearly have no idea what it's like. If you have hopefully you will understand.


Here are few things 
1. I am meant to be a stay at home dad... 
2. I was running the business three days per week.(when my boy was at day care)
3. In November 2015 I launched the raptor and the business grew 1400% over 6 months..
4. I started hiring staff and trying to train them. I lost some and gained some more.. it takes time and mistakes are guaranteed.
5. I am still in my garage.
6. I am still (meant to be) working three days per week and looking after my 2yr old boy.
7. I have a new 30 day old baby. 
8. My wife needs help due to complicated birth and surgery.
9. I am drastically trying to improve our services and systems... it takes time. Training people takes months. Implementing new system takes months.
10. I again, lost some staff during this time. Need to hire more and train them.
11.  I am also trying to grow the business and improve our offering and keep innovating..  That takes time.
12. I am a popular guy in the world of esk8 buildinh.. I get hundreds of emails each day from non paying customers wanting advice on esk8... 
13. Ordering stock to meet demand is a full time job. We have around 10-15 key suppliers many of them making oem custom parts.. if stock is not ordered and delivered on time everything falls over...  

I am one of maybe 3-4 business in the entire world selling this niche products into a rapidly growing market....

Demand is greater than supply...

So can you understand? Do I need to explain this further? I am not amazon!!!.  I'm just a dude in a garage trying to follow my dreams....

So back off.

[/quote]

The thing is, he can't. He's stated before that selling them at $120 was basically at cost of parts to him. So he would lose money upfront from the sale.

He's stated he over specs his components, in an attempt to make a more robust vesc that can handle a bit more abuse.

My question is, why does he spend so much more on components than you for a vesc, if cheaper components were just as good?

At the end of the day, this issue of pins cutting into power wires is just sloppy manufacturing. I don't doubt they are manufactured to IPC2 standard, I've just lost my respect for that standard. Never heard of this happening with a non-enertion vesc. Every batch, it's always something.

Here's a thought @onloop. Maybe sell another esc for those who need a cheap option and the vesc platinum with warranty for those who can spend a bit more?

The thing is, people buy them not understanding how likely it is to break on them. They were told by the forum they are the best speed controller (and they are), but they have been gaining a bad reputation, due to so many of them breaking. Your not the only vendor on here, yet Its rare to see a forum post about a chaka vesc being broken, or anyone else for that matter. 9/10 times, its an enertion vesc. Now you sell more, so that's the excuse. But I would ask, if you sell 1000 vesc, how many of those vescs goes to a customer on this forum? I would be willing to bet chaka is supplying at least 1/4 of the vesc members on this forum use. if you supply half, lets say, that still doesn't explain why 9/10 are enertion. You see, the math just doesn't add up to explain it away as you sell more than others, thus you see more of mine breaking.

A broken vesc topic doesn't have to be "it's broken, what do I do?", but "why is my vesc not working?", which leads to figuring out the problem is it's broken. No reason it can't happen with a chaka vesc too. You won't get that first case with chakas vesc really, cause they know what to do. But usually, people like to confirm something broken with the community if they don't have a gigantic gaping hole in their vesc (and sometimes, it's not really broken. I helped someone firgure out they had wrong settings, and not a physical problem the other day).

@Svenska Thank you for your opinions. You gave me some perspective in an area I don't know enough about (I should know more). My only counter argument is that those kinds of open source hardware are being bought often because they are open source. They are people who know how to write software, and understand he hardware at least on a more familiar level then your average consumer. Now with the vesc, it is marketed to your average consumer. It's been made into a consumer level product, and if you are going to turn an open source, unpredictable product into a consumer product, than you need protections in place to protect the consumer. It's not sold to the same type of people. Which is why protections need to be in place.

Maybe he simply has more customers than Ollin?
And (most likely), he has less educated customers, as Ollin is kind of an inside tip.

But tbh, i killed 5 vescs so far(2 Enertion, 2 Ollin, 1 Esk8.de ), it always was my fault, i never ran to the forums and cried about it.

Also, i am running 4 Enertion VESCs in builds i made with no problems so far. i also have Ollin vescs with heatsinks for high Current or FOC setups, but i still think Enertions 99$ vesc is a ggood if you want more bang for your buck. (i can do a Dual instead of a mono for nearly the same prize)

Its marketing spin... Hes using all the parts as per vedder bom... unless he has changed the design of the vesc (which he hasnt) he is using the parts we are all using. 

The only risk with vesc is buying from China as they  often use substituting with fake parts.

Kudos to those of you who make VESC available to the community.  That's you @Onloop, @Chaka, and @torqueboards (might've missed others)!

Like @Svenska mentioned - something open source and effectively a BETA product is not something you'd normally get ANY warranty with.  I've had great experiences with Enertion the last time i had an issue they more than surpassed what i expected (speed of shipping and really no questions asked).   

But when you are working with an ESC like VESC - it's going to sometimes fail.  Pressure puncturing the wire sheath is going to depend on your installation, and cannot be bench tested before shipment.  **It's not a QC failure - it's an install failure.**  _If you are going to have it smashed into an enclosure, or press it down too much installing it elsewhere - **this is your install issue, not a failure of the product**._  Now knowing your placement - and being informed of this possible failure point - you can remove the shrink, inspect, and eliminate those pins to avoid the potential issue.  That requires you to be A) aware and informed, and B) willing to be  responsible for your own install and set expectations according to the method you purchase the VESC.  (99 budget = no warranty and on your own, or more elsewhere or more for the extended warranty option).  Or buy version with a warranty, or pay to have it repaired if possible.  There are a few who will do this, but it's not cheap.

This is DIY after all.  If you are on a shoestring budget - then you are even more responsible to do your research, determine likely failure points, and inspect and adjust to mitigate them.

saving up some $ and buying the least expensive option possible, with no research, no planning and slapping it together is a recipe for disappointment.

I've killed my fair share of hardware.  I own the install and any failures were typically due to my lack of experience or poor install.  I killed two VESCs (in a row) bench testing and repeating a failure (for science?) was poor judgment on my part.  I did learn how to repair the DRV chip(s) as a result, and didn't call the place i bought it from and complain their VESC failed.  Own your own shit and figure out how to fix, or pony up $ for a new one, and be more careful next time testing or installing!

I'll keep buying the un-warrantied options and save that extra $ to buy a few extra DRV chips, or towards an upgraded solder station, or towards another battery pack...  

My .02.

Okay so that's what I was asking for. Just a simple answer : 

1. Do I get a chance to get a new one without spend a penny because the vesc blew due to manufacturer problem.   

2. Buy the enertion platinum even though it was because a manufacturer problem then anyway you can get a new one and no worries in this whole year!


I've sent massag via email and forum to you and enertion support 14 days  ago just wanted to know what you guys could offer. One of your new number told me to wait a few days more plus you didn't replied either email or forum text. Luckily you finally replied in this thread.....okay I'm about to buy the platinum now and send my vesc back to you. Hopefully I can get a new vesc within.... let's say half month?


So I still reckon enertion is a wonderful brand just doing things bit slowly....perhaps few months later those staff will be solve and everything works perfectly. Um. :nerd:

I do run a business, I deal with customer, I deal with suppliers, I deal with staff and the mandatory issues that they all bring. It's called running a business, it's not easy. 

However you decided to do all this so don't start complaining how hard your life is, you decided to market to grow your business and most of all you decided to blurt out your sales volumes not thinking someone would think to call you up on the fact that your making good bank and somehow can't figure out how to sustain good customer service....throw some cash at it 👍🏻

Don't be that guy using a bag full of excuses to keep your bag full of cash cause I know which one will be empty first. 

Most importantly wtf are you on here answering my ridiculous rant, could you not of answered all those emails you never have time for.

You confronted @chaka to not be open about the improvements he made and the parts he used.
Now I just had a look at your instagram and it looks like you have a new capacitor board that makes it easier to combine two VESCs. Are you sharing the PCB design with us so that we can also use it?

Can't see a Gerber or Eagle file - just showing the drawing is not sharing. Please include the actual files so that other people can reproduce this.

i don't have those files, i am not an electronics engineer, i simply paid my factory to make this...then i shared the drawings.  maybe someone with those skillz or that software can make the files for everyone.
