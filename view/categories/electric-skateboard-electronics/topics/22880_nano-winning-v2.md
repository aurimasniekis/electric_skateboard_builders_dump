This seems interesting: http://eskating.eu/product/nano-receiver-v2/

Anyone tried this one? Is it just a re-skin or did they improve the electronics? (Or did they take Jason's improvements from the Nano-X and put them in their own case? :wink:)

Receiver also looks the same for the Nano-X, and I find that amazingly reliable :)

I'm running the the old version ( the one without winning on the remote) and have very minimal issues with it. I'm interested how this one will be.

We sell this but haven't updated photos. It's replaced our old Nano Remote.

Does it offer any improvements on the reliability? Or is it only a reskin? :slight_smile:

I saw it a while ago but it seems so similar to the nano, all the same features.
Hopefully its a fixed version!

Found a supplier should be able to do a group buy for around $40-50 each if anyone is interested like this post. 

le$$ if we hit 50 remotes, waiting on shipping quote.

Do you want me to contact the manufacturer and check if anything has changed other than the case?

Hey, New nano remote version has improved and very good signal, no bind plug required.

Would be easier to asjust trottle because of that button out of the case, 2nd Channel seems to work like "ride mode", in few words has two kind of acceleration mode, slow and fast 

I can't use 2nd Channel to turn on/off lights, i Will ask this to the manufacturer

Looks like they took all Jasons improvements/features and made a new skin. Very nice.
@saul shoot me a message if/when you do a group buy

Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's the same manufacturer. Jason did some improvements on their winning, and they're now putting it into their own. :)
