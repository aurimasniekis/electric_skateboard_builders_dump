Just curious if anyone has electrified a really long deck like the LBL OSD.

I could fit a million batteries under this sucker.

anything specific inputs of pro's and cons of using a SUPER long deck?!

Looks like you barely have any space for your feet. How is your ride on that thing? Looks really inconvenient. I would prefer a standard 9-inch width deck for esk8.

I'm currently electrifying a [Koastal Drifter II](https://koastal.co/collections/koastal-deck-only/products/koastal-60-drifter-ii-cruising-carving-longboard-skateboard-deck-only)

Make sure you get trucks that are super-duper carvy and turny because the length "tightens" the steering significantly.  I'm building with double-kingpin Supercarve trucks

I'm not going to make build threads until they're done :stuck_out_tongue:

There will be too many questions that I just don't have the answers for yet, so why torture you

I had a 50inch wheelbase on my diy flexible longboard it was super fun to drive and so flexible thst if you would jump while on the middle it would touch the floor the trucks had to be super loose

Super fun board to drive untill it got stolen
