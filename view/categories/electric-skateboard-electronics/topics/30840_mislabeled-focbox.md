I am in the process of adding extensions to my motors for running foc. However, the label for the sensor wire connector on the FOCBOX is a different order than the pcb!

FOCBOX: 5V, H3, H2, H1, T, GND
PCB: 5V, T, H3, H2, H1, T, GND

These are brand new FOCBOX so I assume this should not be an issue but would like to make sure.

I'm interested in this as well.  This is what I've found so far...

MOTOR SIDE  >>  JST-ZH 6 pin 1.5mm pitch
VESC SIDE   >>  JST-PH 6 pin 2.0mm pitch

* Motor HAL Sensor Cable

Pin 1 (BLACK)   =  Ground
Pin 2 (BLUE)    =  Phase C(3)
Pin 3 (YELLOW)  =  Phase B(2)
Pin 4 (WHITE)   =  Phase A(1)
Pin 5 (GREEN)   =  Temp Control
Pin 6 (RED)     =  + 5.0v =/- 10%

@EnertionSupport is this legitimately an issue? Are the stickers seriously wrong? I have found another thread where this was an issue on the previous vesc-x. New stickers and still mislabeled? I assume you will have a reassuring reply for this!

Yup, the issue was already reported and confirmed by Enertion in linked post.

Just to be clear. Follow the order on the PCB and ignore the sticker, correct?

Im pretty sure that the next batch should have it right, enertion support was notified (should be wrong in the first place).

Yes ignore the sticker..

@JLabs this is the connector on the BKB 190kv 6374. Is the missing wire for the temp?

Red and Black are power with the other 3 being sensors. So yes you are correct about the temp not being included

Hmm im not sure if the VESC auto detects that or not.. I would think so.. Im gonna half to phone a friend for that.

Ok cool deal. I can just match the order on the manufactured connector on the motor.

Phase wire order doesn't matter if you're using a VESC. ;)

They don't matter, you run detection and it figures it out. The order is important for hobby escs

Awesome! So as long as the 5V and GND are in place and the T is empty all is good.

@Jinra - Ditto at what Jinra mentioned.. for VESC doesn't matter the order typically only specifically for RC Sensored ESCs would it matter. VESC will auto detect.

Hi guys, i have same type of motor sensored wire with @flywithgriff and the motor sensor also have no temp wire. The connector wire seems had different color order too but theres white wire for temp i quess. Sud i just ignored the connector wire color as long as the motor wire go with rite order with the focbox, is that correct? Or i need to reorder the connector wire and do i need to remove the temp wire on the connector since the motor wire also don't have? Thanks for the advice üòä

Reordering the wires in the new connector is a choice. You don't have to but I'm a bit OCD so I did! Make sure the red and black wires are in the two ends to match the FOCBOX sticker. The T opening stays empty and the other three wires are sensor wires that can be in any order. I just did a conversion last night and will post pics in a bit for you.

This is the correct wiring order! The sticker is wrong. As long as the red, black, and open space are in this position the other three sensor wire order does not matter.

Do you re-order the connector wire color? And also remove the T wire?

Is it work? How if im not re-ordering and leave the T wire conected to the focbox eventho its not conected to the motor sensor? Was wondering about that

Yes it works. You do not have to re-order the wires. However, if you do not re-order them you should ignore the colors and make sure the order is correct with how you attach them to the motor sensor wires.

Hey guys, I have a question regarding this issue.

And its that I have an APS 170KV motor, and it has 6 wires for the sensors, and the thing is... In this thread I'm not supposed to be connecting the T on the focbox (Which is in H3 on the sticker) but Bruno from APS is telling me to connect the wires as they are.

And he also tells me that there is no TEMP wire on that motor.

So, right now I'm connected as this thread states, without the T... Should I Just connect them all?

And how do I know if its working properly??

They don‚Äôt. I got two focboxes a few weeks ago and the labelling is correct now

## \#35 Posted by: banjaxxed Posted at: 2017-10-10T15:26:38.279Z Reads: 126

Bruno will probably have wired them the right way which ignores what is on the sticker

I would assume that the sticker doesn't matter as the PCB is correct and matches whatever comes out from the motor's sensor JST connector.

I ended up connecting the 6 cables coming out of the motor, and notice nothing.

Is there anyway to know if the sensors are working properly?

So do Focbox‚Äôs read temperature if the motor has a heat sensor?

The focbox unity can. I believe the old Focbox could too yes.

But it require the newest firmware 3.xx, from either Vedder or Ackmaniac.
