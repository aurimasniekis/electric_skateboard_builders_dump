C- is charge minus. All negative ends go to the BMS and the positive goes to the battery. That looks like a BestTech BMS and I think @Namasaki has the wiring diagram.

@IsTalo some of those BMS's from Bestech are configured to charge and discharge from the same ports. In that case I believe that C- is not used. It depends on how they configure it at the factory. Check w your vendor to verify how yours is configured. Or use the bestech data sheet by matching model numbers.

Not sure if this the exact same (mine was 10S; the specs may be different for yours), but it's the same model from BesTech. Could have some useful information.
