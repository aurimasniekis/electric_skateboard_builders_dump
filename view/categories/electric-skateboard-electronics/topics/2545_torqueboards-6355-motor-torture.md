So I may have fucked up and used my motor as a 5th wheel for about 1.5km
and got it wet a few weeks ago
and broke a magnet some how

:fearful: wow

I've floored a Tacon for a couple feet (maybe 20-50), but it began making a very distinct screeching noise, so I noticed before it got too beaten up.

dayuuuuum! draggin' ass..there's laws against that, in NY. I heard that magnet shrapnel was the cause of a major traffic jam which led to quite a few cold hipster food deliveries. NJEV was very upset.

so moment i put the power on and apply power it binds up and makes really bad scraping sounds.

im going to remove the magnet bit i push back into place and if that doesnt work i'll show it to my master corporal and see what he says (havent got to motors and batteries in class yet.)

You were able to fix your motor? Where did you get the magnet?

I was lazy and just ordered a new one.

I wouldnt be shocked if those motors would still work even if you just removed that broken part... wouldnt be ideal but most of it is there

Have you tried removing the broken bits and running it? I bet it will still work unless I missed something in this thread.
