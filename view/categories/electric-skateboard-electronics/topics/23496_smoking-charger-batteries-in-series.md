ok so this is my first time putting batteries in series and i though i did it correctly i put some pictures any way i tried to charge them and with out plugging the charger into the wall the charger started to smoke out of all the ports so of coarse i un plunged it and moved it out of my house just in case. Any ideas of what i did wrong.

Pretty sure you have the order of the balance leads incorrect.

Switch balance connectors. 

Look at the bigger balance connector, the red wire at the end is the positive. So the red wire side of connector needs to go to the pack that you're using the red power wire. Positive to positive

Yup, the balance connectors are backwards.
what I don't understand is how this didn't short out the batteries.
Check your batteries for damage with a meter.

If you have an IMAX charger, you need to modify the 2-3 to 6 connector
you need to snip one of the inside wires that come together, either black or red.

Reverse the order of the 3S balance connectors.  Then label your connections "A" and "B".  Then cut the middle black wire of the 3S->6S adapter, so that if you hook it up wrong in the future, it won't cause any damage (just won't work)

Switch connectors, take it into a cooler area, and check the voltage WITHOUT charging. I made the same mistake a long time ago and the batteries were permanently damaged, so be very careful and watch for if the batteries get puffy or start to smoke

the main red from pack 1 is connected to the main black from pack 2
So if he cut one of the center wires, the balance current would have to go through the main wires

You don't need to cut one of them but if you did you should have cut the black not the red

The problem you had was because you did not plug the 3s connectors into the correct sockets
Here is a chart that I made that shows correct hook up.

Don't re connect the red wire you are better off without it.
You can still use the charger for less than 6s and it can probably be repaired with new resistors.

On the contrary, you need the red wire because it carries the balance current from cell 3 of pack 1.
The black wire you can do without.
Look at the diagram, you can see that if you cut the red wire, the balance current for cell 3 will have to pass through the main cable.
cutting the black wire would be ok but not the red.
And with that I have got to go see my grandson, I've done all I can to help here.

No you dont need it.
It makes no difference if its there or not.

Removing it just saves you from potentially shorting your whole battery if you plug it wrong.

It really doesnt matter where you cut it, the lead connecting the positive and negative ends of the battery connect the 3rd cell, giving it a path. Which is why you do need to cut one or the other if you are using an IMAX charger. IMAXes will short out your connections if you leave both intact. I don't know what charger you have used. Or i'm completely wrong, and my board is part of my imagination.

I have this hobby charger though I seldom use it any more. Now I charge through a bms with a Lab power supply.

If you connect the double 3s to the 6s adapter correctly, there is no danger of shorting your battery.
The positive from cell 3 is already connected to the negative of cell 4 when the batteries are in series.
Unless I am mistaken, the hobby charger puts current into the battery through the heavy wires and drains current for balancing out of the battery through the light gauge wires.
If you cut the middle red wire you are removing the balance port's connection to cell 3.
 So how is it gonna balance cell 3? Is it going to take a less direct path though the main power cables?
This is why I say don't cut the red wire.  You can cut the black wire ok, but not the red.

That connected circuit in green being connected to an _**IMAX**_ charger, _**the one he is using**_, Causes Shorts. I guarantee the 3rd cell reads, because I can see each individual voltage on my charger, and all cells are accurate to what the charger gives me. Maybe it is fine with your charger, I was told with _**IMAX specific chargers**_, there was an issue with series balance connectors.

I am running x2 8000mah 3s lipos in series and I didn't cut any wires, I just made sure I hooked my balance wires up correctly.  You should listen to what @Namasaki is telling you.  If you cut the red wire in battery 1 there is no other  path than the mains to balance from bat 1 cell 3 to bat 2 cell 1.

Not sure what all these comments are about but @lowGuido already told you guys whats up. It is clearly visible in the initial photo that the balance connector order is wrong. Why there was no short when connecting the balance leads baffles me a bit but nonetheless it was wrong.

Cutting the red from the balance cable of B1 or the black from B2 or leaving them together does NOT matter. They are the SAME and they are all connected at some point anyway. Any additional or cut connection does not matter as they will still be connected anyway via at least the main cables.

It is all about potential voltages and once you connect the main pos of B1 with the main ground of B2 you are effectively connecting them to be the same. B2 GND = B1 POS

So weird though that people think it matters and could destroy their chargers (even if connected correctly).
Actually I think it is better to have them connected as that will show you right on connection of the balance wires that you have done something wrong. The balance wire would burn but the battery will live on once the current destroyed the little wire. With a cut you will only realize wrong polarity on connection to the charger.
For me cutting seems worse amd higher of a risk than just leaving them connected.

This.

If you have all wires connected and are balancing cell 3, your current will go through the path of least resistance. Whether that is main and black wire on pack two or just the red wire on pack one (in reality, it will be split between them)

If you have the red wire cut, and are balancing cell 3, your current will go through the main and then through the black balance wire on pack 2. Is this bad? No. Your main lead is meant to handle up to 100A, 1 extra amp is going to be negligible. 

If you have the black wire cut, and are balancing cell 4 (cell 1 in pack 2) then the current will flow through red balance wire on pack 1 and through the main to cell 4. Same as above. 

@MrHappy **None** of this will **ever ever ever** short a charger. 
**I'll bet you $1000**
If you shorted your charger and or battery then you did something else wrong.

Never ever do this! Honestly, after reading this I would not trust you handling batteries at all. 

The reason you should never do this is that if battery wasn't already dead, you could easily have caused a fire, and not a small one... 
Your wires I'm guessing are at least 16awg (most likely 12). Touching the main leads like you did would either cause a large spark and leave a big burn mark on either end or cause a huge spark melting the wires and fusing them together. (That's how a tig welder works). After the wires are fused together the internal resistance of your battery is higher than the resistance through the wire. The battery will heat up and since it's a sealed lipo, the pressure inside the battery will also increase until it explodes. The chemicals inside a Lipo burn really hot and you cannot extinguish it with water or your average house extinguisher, (you need a halon extinguisher to put it out and they run at a couple of hudred dollars per charge). I've seen plenty of LiPo fires in RC fields from people doing similar stuff to what you did so consider yourself lucky! Google Lipo fire and watch videos then tell me that's something you would want in your home. 

I hope this opens your eyes as to how dangerous what you are doing is and at the very least makes you think about everything you do and how badly it could end. 

I'm glad there was no fire. Please follow these steps to dispose of the battery safely:

Prepare a plastic container (do not use metal) of cold
water. And mix in 1/2 cup of salt per gallon of water. Drop the battery into the salt water. Allow the battery to remain in the tub of salt water for at least 2 days.
This will discharge all the energy out of the battery. 

Cut off the connector of the main leads strip the leads, twist and or solder them together, then tape the leads. This is so that the battery can never hold a charge again. 

Then you can wrap them up in paper and throw them in the trash if your city allows. I recommend taking them to the nearest recycling center.
