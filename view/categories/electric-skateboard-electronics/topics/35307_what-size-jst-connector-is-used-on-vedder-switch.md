And where can I buy one with wires already attached?

Thanks. Pardon my ignorance... but ph is the size I need? I'm seeing 'Jst 2.0 Ph 3 pin' and 'JST 1.0 PH 3 pin'

You need the crimp on connectors too. You will also need a jst crimper.

This might be an easier option for you but the quality is not as nice as genuine jst connectors. https://www.ebay.com/i/201617377362?chn=ps&dispItem=1
