The typical setup will be our dual direct drive setup with our 110mm wheels which will use a Kegel Adapter but we'll offer an ABEC Adapter for those that want to use ABEC wheels. We'll probably offer an adapter for our Pneumatic Tires we're also trying to release. I am a bit hesitant as obviously with the larger wheels we reach a higher top speed.

@BruSkater - No launch date yet.. still testing. Just decided to show what it's looking like. :slight_smile:

@Mikenopolis - I think the current design we have would be a better option. I try to make sure everything in the past compatible but it's pretty hard.. To design a better system, you sorta need to start from scratch. Sucks...

Well if you ever need a heavy rider to test out your equipment I'm your man, I ride my boards hard and I'm 300lbs 6'6" and size 16M US shoes.

I rode the Carvon Evo prototype and I got say I was not impressed I hope these have more torque.

Not sure just yet.. Testing a few different options to see what's best for our setups. Leaning towards around 50-65KV though. I'm thinking 65KV. But that's not definite yet.

12S / 65kv direct drive / 110mm wheels = 30 - 36mph.

I think it'd be great if the ideal speed we're designed around 10S, so those who want to go faster can run 12S... Push 40mph if they want. I'd want to go faster and personally would love to see 80-85kv DD.

@FredrikHems would be nice.. but the motors are pretty big already. Motor can itself is 70mm diameter and that's because we're using a thicker motor can for increased durability.

@BruSkater a bit over 30mph and we specifically use 12S. I don't see any point in 10S as for $40-60 dollars (difference from 10S4P vs 12S4P) you get a huge benefit for the higher voltage and increased watt hours.

@skatardude10 I'm very hesitant on offering higher speed setups.. We might in the future but as of now our main focus is the everyday rider.

I feel you. I realized that most people probably wouldn't end up needing the extra speed and would instead prefer higher torque. 

Can't wait to see these things in action. I might have to devise a small cruiser/commuter board for these things when they release.

@torqueboards, please don't be worried about high speed set ups.  We build because we want to push the boundaries.  Everyday riders have so many options available its ridiculous but If you want to buy a board that performs as well as a diy there aren't many options.  If  you want a less powerful version you can always use a 10s battery.
I'm personally very excited about this direct drive but please don't hold back on performance.

Exactly .. and less horrible accidents on @torqueboards equipment and less esk8 prohibition for the rest of us

Besides, torque (and braking power) is waaaaaaaaay more satisfying in an everyday environment than top speed, and, um, look what's written on the motor :stuck_out_tongue:

If you riding in city like London, you need more torque/acceleration than top speed. Cause you always brake/accelerate my 1:5 with lots of torque and instant acceleration saved my ass so many times in many dangerous situations...

Plus the feeling then u drag some cars on red light and they are dumbfounded afterwards in next redlight :blush:

For me for city riding strong brakes must match top speed.

High top speed lets me ride with the cars and not with the bikes (danger!) and pedestrians (DANGER!).

Torque is nice to have, but the other 2 keep me out of trouble.

To change termination u go from grounding all the phase ends together to linking the phases (overly simplified) I have a circuit I'm working on that will handle the whole process of determination on the fly through multi-channel receivers kinda like the way turnsignals work from esk8.life (I think that's the website)

@torqueboards would it be possible to have the motor winded in wye for 50kv? So @b264 and others that want torque can have it but also that way anyone who may want more top speed (me and @Holyman92) can rewind the motors to delta which will bump the kV upto about 85, which is the same as carvon and a perfect combination of speed and torque

Not to stray too far from the discussion... I run my belts just a tad bit loose but I would not really consider them loose. I still get belt skipping even with 20/36t. Do steel pullies fare better with wear and tear than aluminum? I do notice my aluminum 20t pulley rounding out noticeably, and I'm assuming this effects the belt skipping. Do steel pulleys *not* round out, hence able to run them looser?

Aluminum pulleys will wear out faster than steel pulleys, about 1/3 the lifetime depending in how you ride. I think your problem maybe the 20t pulley, I got a lot more skips when I was running 20t, less mesh because the diameter is larger.

Larger diameter will increase the number of teeth in mesh with the belt.  You might be trying to say that more teeth in mesh is worse for skippage, but the number of teeth in mesh will certainly be more.

@torqueboards These motors look interesting.

I am interested in a 4WD set up with pneumatic tires. Torque is more important to me than speed.

Precision trucks sound good too. Any chance of having an adjustable base plate option? Something similar to the Don't Trip Euphoria Truck's adjustable base.

https://www.dtskate.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=1x%2DEuphoria%2DAdjustable

As most of you already know, you can make your board more stable at speed by running a split angle setup. This means your front baseplate is at a higher angle than the rear. When you do this, the turning is done more from the front than the rear, sort of like a car. The popular and stable Landyachtz Evo deck, increases the front baseplate angle by 9 degrees and reduces the rear by the same amount. It would be fantastic to easily adjust your baseplate angles to what works best for you.

On my traditional and electric boards, I wedge most of my front trucks and dewedge some of my rear trucks. It is not all about preventing speed wobbles. It's good for long distance pumping and it also gives your board a "surfy" feel. It would be great to not have to bother with wedges and the bent hardware they cause.

I am looking forward to these motors being readily available for a fair price.

Best of luck.

@torqueboards would it be possible to have the motor winded in wye for 50kv? So @b264 and others that want torque can have it but also that way anyone who may want more top speed (me and @Holyman92) can rewind the motors to delta which will bump the kV upto about 85, which is the same as carvon and a perfect combination of speed and torque
[/quote]

A choice of 50kv wye or 85kv delta termination would be the best thing ever.  Also for those that want 4WD, software could be made to use both kv -- 50kv in the front for extreme braking and takeoff-assist and 85kv in the rear for top-end.

But if I had to choose just one, it'd be somewhere in the 59kv - 62kv range

@everyonewhowantstousepneumatics

An axial direct drive with pneumatics isn't going to work, the only exception being one with stupidly large brushless motors wound to a very low kV. The beauty of a reduction system is that the amplification of torque is directly proportional to the gear ratio. 
Decreasing the kV of a 6374 motor doesn't amplify the torque as a reduction does.

So the same principle would apply to the Carvon direct drives as well? I was hoping to go pneumatics too with a stealthier look from either the carvons or the TB direct drives on a 2WD as going 4WD at least in the case of Carvon's V4TD would cost more and weigh much more as well

No - because the firmware would not send most power to the front wheels at low speed and rear wheels at high speed -- and wouldn't send braking to the rear wheels except hard braking to the front wheels, on a linear split.

This could be added, though - like a traction control module in the software.

Torque is determined by the number winds and the strength of the magnets in the system. To lower the Kv you have to increase the number of winds and for any given volume of copper you can fit around a stator, increasing the turns of the wire decreases the current throughput because the wire has to be thinner. 
That's why hubs heat up more (and are always going to be less efficient than a satellite system), you can't rewind a 3000w 6374 for torque and expect to be able to push 3000w through it again.

no you cant rewind a rated 3000w motor for low kv and expect the same power output and eff but you can make a bigger motor that has therefore less electrical resistance and will have the same electrical efficiency and also greater mechanical efficiency than the original 3000w motor with a pulley

if you look into it i think you'll find the torque potential is limited by the diameter of the interface and the volume of the materials and their properties.  with many magnets and teeth youre splitting those magnets and teeth up.  you end up with double the amount of magnets and teeth but each of them with half the strength.  i looked all over to find this out and have was told this straight from the horse's mouth...of the guy who wrote this very well regarded book https://www.amazon.com/Design-Brushless-Permanent-Magnet-Machines-Hendershot/dp/0984068708

You can‚Äôt just make the motor larger and call the system more efficient!

if you make the motor larger, and it's primary loss was copper, especially if it's a slow turning hub motor with very low iron losses, yes making the motor bigger makes it more efficient as, just as you said above, the wire can now be thicker.

:+1:
[/quote]

had to add inside

but...yes adding more poles adds more torque.  so yes more magnets and poles you can say adds more torque as it lowers the kv,  but youre trading copper losses for iron. which may be good and ideal in some cases depending how fast the motor goes largely.  that's my take on it all.  happy to hear any disagreement!
but besides that point i also still think a direct drive is capable of the same efficiency as a pulley drive in our typical application.  maybe not ideal on the steep uphill but overall.   going up the steepest hill...i think you could use a bigger motor with the right kv and you'd be as efficient.

Yeah, I know. Also generally by increasing the teeth, you increase copper fill. 

I was thinking more along the lines of the physical restraints imposed on a system when you make the motor larger, which was why I said you couldn't call 'the system more efficient" as opposed to "the motor more efficient".  You're right - a larger motor is more efficient than a smaller one given they both operate in the same conditions. The bone I'm picking at is the design of the system - efficiency isn't just for the motor, it's the collective efficiency of all the subsystems together.

```
id have thought increasing the teeth would likely decrease the copper fill.  not that ive compared.  i imagine with double the teeth if you keep the same overall iron content, so instead of a 2mm thick tooth its now 1mm, the copper content could potentially be the same here with 1mm slots instead of 2mm and each of those slots now having half the fill,  so equal....except when getting more and more teeth there is a mechanical limit and they have to be so thick to stand up to vibrations and physical forces, especially so on a skateboard, so at some point the smaller teeth necessitates having less copper eventually as it needs to be iron with the bigger teeth so they dont bend or break.  (although thinking about it again, alone here,  if the stator were designed to have teeth with  no slots, with the diameter being complete iron, that would give a lot of support and maybe you could get away with the 1 turn per tooth motor im talking about below..and benefits of no cogging and smooth coasting)

but surely with more teeth you COULD get better copper fill if you just decreased the ratio of iron to copper.  and maybe that would work well and making me want to try modeling motors again

but in adding more teeth and dropping the kv that way, as apposed to doing it with more turns of wire, ..id like to see how that would go.   It would be probably more work to build but assuming the teeth are still strong enough, at lets guess 36 teeth, and before with 12 teeth the motor needed maybe 10 wire turns to get to the desired kv, maybe now it would need a third of that, and at maybe 3 turns..and going along those lines maybe if  50 teeth are strong enough you could do a single turn in the slot and then you could maybe have a cast piece inserted instead of trying to fit in cylindrical wire, or have the slot just the right shape for a shape wire, and therefore get 100% fill as apposed to even best case with cylindrical wire is roughly 85%.and still achieve the same kv.  but the iron losses at speed would suck and now it's an uphill monster only.  and surely not so simple and its assuming the motor were designed so that all those small magnet fields went where they were supposed to go


back on point...how many teeth does the stator have @torqueboards

Try adding more teeth but next-to instead of in-between the other teeth.  You'd need to write custom firmware to drive it though... but it could possibly lower the kv without thinner teeth or thinner wire.  So imagine two stators on the same axle but offset relative to one another so each tooth was "grabbing" the magnet at a slightly different time

Sounds great! Yeah I agree with the amount of abuse the boards get, generally would prefer a simpler system with less parts as each of these parts failing would result in more or less an inoperable board.

Yeah simplicity of no gearing reduction still needs a kick for pushing heavier pneumatics. How about compatibility with @psychotiller six shooters? I‚Äôve read theyre just as heavy as 107mms which is really nice as far as rolling resistance goes I think. 

Maybe with an AWD we could get better torque off the line and when going over uneven surfaces?

@torqueboards if you need testers I can test them down under, in the next few months temp are gonna get up to 45 degrees c, that would be good to see what happens to the rubber tyres when exposed to lots of heat

guys.. this is too much.. We got the best beta testers in the world!

Our new pneumatic tires are going to be made with 100% cement in a square shape. You guys are going to have so much fun!

On a serious note though. They should be sweet. I'll keep everyone filled in. We definitely need to get some tested miles on the tires.

I'm wondering if some skaters might like a smaller 5" or 125mm
 pneumatic to go with the new direct drives? Maybe even an airless?
```

---
## \#147 Posted by: torqueboards Posted at: 2018-08-02T16:08:52.563Z Reads: 471

```
@Luvafreeride - Was harder to go 125mm since there's not much space for any air. I also don't think we need all the options.

We'll have a 110mm 75A wheels which should be more then you need for a urethane option.

I originally tried going 140/150mm pneumatics but overall 160mm was a better option. That way your rim can actually be a bit bigger and you can have a 7" or even 8" pneumatic tire as well. Otherwise 5.5" to 8" is a fairly big jump. Everything needs to be scaled down with a smaller tire as you'll need space for air. Evolve even tried 5.5" tires before but scraped the idea. I think 6.5" would be the smallest. Either way you would typically need a specific deck to fit any wheels over 97mm.

I even looked at making 125mm urethane on our rims but I don't think there's much benefit. The 110x65 will have thicker urethane 40mm thick and 65mm wide vs with our rims a urethane 125x50 would be 20mm thick, 50mm wide. If you asked me, I'd take the 110x65 if you're going urethane.

We used some huge industrial bearings to support the motor. 12mm thick. Front bearing is also big but no photos atm. So I'm hoping we can dog em out and they'll last. We're technically not even riding them as we would in an in-wheel hub motor. Other items added for scale.

If it's really anywhere near $700 then I'm definitely out. The way I see it, it's 2 really big motors + custom truck + development costs.

2 big motors: (let's go for [the most expensive ones)](collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6380-170kv): 2 *  $135 = $270
Really nice precision truck: around $130
Development costs: $???

Total: $ 400 + ???

So around $400 to $500 seems like a fair maximum to me. Of course, I know this math doesn't exactly add up, but if it's much more I'll just pray that the Carvon torquedrive comes back in stock, or that the Chinese clone this idea soon. :wink:

That's my point, none of us do but I assure you @torqueboards will need to sell at least 100 sets to recover the development costs.  If these come in under $600 Ill be very surprised.

I agree, and honestly I was on the fence about Dexter making these, but the fact is Carvon is having production issues and cant supply its current market base.  Most people are not gonna wait once the idea is out there, so its either Dexter or Chinese manufacturing that is going to fill the supply gap.  Id rather it be Dexter.

$135/motor is for large manufacturing runs with slim profit margins. These motors are heavily customized, with additional machining and parts for the wheel interface.

Really nice precision trucks are more like $1000. The cheapest precision trucks are around your price.

@torqueboards went all out and got Riptide for all the rubber parts.

Also warranty/support and spare parts. And cost of doing business in the great US and A.

Dexter deserves to make some profit for his efforts as well. I imagine his level of investment is getting pretty high, and he seems to be filling all the gaps with new developing products!

There are many segments to the market. The low end is covered, and for most of us, leaves us wanting.

@Epskampie yeah, unfortunately.. to do things right it ends up costing more.

We've worked on this design quite a bit and have tested tons of different variations and options to build a powerful and reliable direct drive setup. R&D costs money and takes time.

There's just no point in using casted trucks, crappy bushings,, crappy bearings.. just to save a bit. It ends up becoming a regretful purchase. There's also no passion for us in offering lower quality products and unhappy customers. We'd prefer to release products that are different then what's already available which are more reliable and higher performance.

These motors are designed and will be priced for customers that want the quality and performance. If there is no market for it then we simply won't sell it.

Either way, I think even you will be happy about the pricing once it's officially said. :) We simply just don't want to make any promises just yet.

This is so true.  There are "toys" and "tools" and, for the most part, if you want a tool, you need to make it yourself or get only a **tiny** number of premium brands of prebuilt ... none of which use hub motors or come from California or Australia... and all of which are $2k+

I read so many people saying "I want to do DIY to save money" and it's always the biggest facepalm.  Buy cheap china hub motor shit if you want to save money.  That's like saying I want to build a Lamborghini by hand because the Ford is too expensive to buy

I firmly hope these new direct drive are in the "quality tool" category, aren't listed for-sale until they're in-stock, stand-up to snow and brine, and price is the last thing to be decided, in order for the rest of that to be true.

There are not high enough quality boards on the market yet, and no esk8 repair shops on every corner like there are for cars, so in order to fully use them, you have to DIY even the high-grade commercial brands.  They all break down and stuff wears out.

It‚Äôs not a hobby or an addiction if you sold your car, it‚Äôs just clean, cheap (relatively) transportation.

This is like overclocking vs underclocking. Hotrods vs Honda Accords. Are Metroboards/Boostedboards the Accords?

I was hoping for a reliable low maintenance board with the R2 with extended (2 year) warranty. Early going seems a bit bumpy!

No I'm using gear drive on an ATB, essentially a Hummie deck with longboard trucks on Fatboy Mini 1:3 gear drive.

You'd go for these Direct drives for street setups mainly but currently satellite setups are the way to go if you want that hill climbing torque

Down to test if you need a more serious stress test.... ride 10-20+ miles a day, 7 days a week, and live in a pretty hilly area in SoCal. I always use your guys trucks, motors, and other shit on 2 of my DIY's already but would love to test the new stuff out since I will buy it anyway. Can't go wrong with a member to the 3rd power right...? LMK. PS - Guys I ride with call me board killer cause I'm always need to change/fix things just due to the fact I weigh 200 lbs and ride close to full throttle much of the time in a area with hills. Not my fault, hope these can hang better than anything else though, would be great!

Not 100% decided yet but we currently have samples for 50KV/70KV. Typically in between is probably what it's looking like around 60KV.

Will you make a kit with the direct drive eventually? Enclosure and all. Similar to the belt kit you've got. 

The 110 plus decent trucks will be great for the bike paths/concrete paths around Melbourne, rather than the harsher hub motors limited to a specific size.

Well 62kv would work very well with 110mm and 107mm for 10S and 12S (25.9mph - 31.9mph) (41.6km/h - 51.4km/h)

With 97mm it'd be a bit torquey and with pneumatics it'd be a bit too fast, but I personally think that's the best compromise.  I'd mainly want to use direct drive on short decks with tails that are otherwise hard to electrify...

Haha.. I don't know.. I like it all. It's definitely a different experience. I'll have to test it more and I should be getting some samples out to a few folks soon who can share their view on it.

Personally, I enjoy dual belt drive for unsensored and when climbing steep hills especially running unsensored. DD motors of course would be better sensored.

Thanks @Chaka nice to see you back.

@holyman92 They should fit on MBS, Trampa, Evolve as I made them somewhat similar for the rim size. I figured it would be better overall for them to be fairly similar. Tires/Tubes should be pretty interchangeable. Although, I can't 100% confirm didn't try yet.

@PXSS - Only ABEC/Kegel.. maybe test an option to use our pneumatics but haven't tested yet. I don't think there are any other great options otherwise. Motor can is 70mm diameter. You can go 90 or lower but you'll end up damaging your motor can but it would/should still be perfectly fine. They just won't be pretty no more. :smile: 

@pixelsilva - Yeah, we'll do a rounded inside lip but we tested it with the chamfer and there were no chunking.

I think we‚Äôre probably going with 83A. They are still pretty soft at 83A much softer than other wheels at 83A.
[/quote]

The 83A wheels seem to ride better than the softer ones.  Don't let the number fool you, test them out.  The 'thane is so deep that 83A feels downright cushy.

Same here. Evolve 107s with 100s of miles on them. First ride out one rear wheel chunked, got worried, did loads of reading, saw same problem all over internet.... But since then they haven't lost any thane at all. Now thinking it's just a random thing, like when I bought a new car tyre and got puncture on day one. Sometimes shit just happens !

You can't use the word "wheels" because it's already trademarked.  You need to call them "cylindrical solid tools for mechanical motion"

Oh wait, "cylindrical" is trademarked too.

Okay then you may call them "circle, pulled straight into a 3-dimensional object, as a solid and acting like a tool for unidirectional mechanical motion"

Whoo. Pretty exciting, I'm hopeful! @torqueboards some questions.

- Is the 35mph based on 12s with 110mm wheels?
- Will we be able to purchase the wheel adapters separately?
- how's the torque compared to dual 6355 or dual 6374?
- how are the brakes, especially at high speed?
- do motors get hot?
- what's the 45mph option, and what voltage/wheelsize is it based on?

EDIT I'm 99% in. this is just foreplay

It's based on 12s on the 75kv model with 110mm wheels, 34 miles per hour was literally where I topped out and I was mostly on flats. Bottom end torque is good, not quite as good as belt but if anything I loved the acceleration curve, was very comfy. Once she gets moving she takes off fast. Motors don't get that hot, trucks have heat dissipation built in.

70kv

70 not 75?

I'm thinking, 35mph is enough for me, but 13s should give a bit of a bump if needed, so no need to give up torque and braking by going with the "custom" fast version.

Unless kwad...

* how are the brakes, especially at high speed? **Brakes are strong or more tame. You'll just have to set the settings within the VESC. During testing brakes were too strong.**

They look really well designed and robust. Would have bought them if they had come out a bit early. Money is all gone now. 

@torqueboards what is the free shaft length on the rear trucks?  There are 6 mounting holes so I can definitely make an adapter (for 3d printing) for 6x2 AliExpress pneumatic wheels if it has the required shaft length. 

Rant: Having bought most of my parts for my 1st and 2nd board from TB, I would say that this is over priced by $100 given that this is under sale right now.

I don't understand the pricing complaint. Looking at pricing for a decent belt setup:

Trucks precision 150
Motors 250
Mounts 100
Pulleys 60+30=100
Belts 15
Riptide stuff 50

And that's completely ignoring all other r&d, manufacturing,  and distribution costs.

Hummie is able to use a much longer stator due to it being in-wheel. I tried to fit longer but it was nearly impossible while keeping it reliable. It would also push our setup to use a much longer hanger. Our stator is 52.8x40 but I believe we can fit a stator up to about 45mm with sensors.

It doesn‚Äôt make sense that there‚Äôs no option to just get the rear setup only. Some of us want to use our own front truck for a more personal customization.
[/quote]

It‚Äôs probably the logistics and the setup. Unlike Caliber and Paris , they don‚Äôt have the capital to spout out Trucks, much less separate trucks from a set and have it latter repaired with one later in case it needs to. Then you have to think about whether it‚Äôs msnagnle by the inventory system , and then you have to think about whether or not the cost of adding all that extra work is worth it.

We are using N42SH magnets. We haven't had any issues with heating. Trying to get more out there in the wild so we can do more testing but there's a ton of cooling so I doubt it would be a problem. We had 2-3 different hub motor versions which we've tested in the past. I'd like to think I've checked everything off as far as having any heating issues but always room for improvement.

90mm's would do great.. 80mm would be cutting it short. Probably wouldn't use 80mm.

Should be fine. I'm sure, you've seen short boards with a 218mm Truck.

With wheels on our DD setup is only about 10-15mm wider than our 218mm setup. It's barely noticeable.

Higher KV is for higher topspeed

## \#566 Posted by: Toughook Posted at: 2018-11-27T16:23:57.092Z Reads: 341

I opted for the 90KV version primarily because there are no hills where I live and ride, and I quite fancy the option of going 35mph+ on 107 wheels... Mine will be a 2WD setup. 

Acceleration is too fast for me on my current dual 6374 board, but the top end is too slow @ 29mph. Figured a less aggressive but ultimately faster second board would provide a nice alternative for me :)
```

---
## \#567 Posted by: directC Posted at: 2018-11-27T16:41:07.489Z Reads: 329

so with AWD I need less torque per drive -> weight of board and me / 4 (instead of / 2)
but I'd still have the ~35mph to speed, or am I seeing something wrong?
so if I would change to 90KV, I would have ~45mph top speed and still a torque comparable to 2WD?

I'm not really sure if I want to go 45mph as my raptor2 was about 31mph, and yes, I would have liked even more sometimes, but it's already hella fast and if you have to bail... had that with about 18mph and as it was summer and I didn't have protection (only helmet) I ate some shit
-> next board won't be ridden without protection

If I was doing 2wd, I would go 75kv.  I wouldn't do 4wd on 75kv, don't think it would be worth it.  How quickly do you really need to reach 35?  But having that same quickness, but 10mph more top end potential... now we talking!

Not that I will use that kind of speed often, but I like to experiment!

Just because all that power is there, doesn't mean you hage to always use it!

I mean how quickly do you need to reach 35?

Thats the beauty of the 4wd 90kv.  You have more speed than that on the occasions you want it, but still have the torque (or more!) Of a dual 70kv setup.


What I am trying to say is.... keep the preorder!

I believe they are about $140 each directly from maytech.  Think you can get them down to $100 each on large orders. He's only making $30 bucks or so per motor.
I've been told by alot of members that they are some of the best motors available atm. 
Just under $300 for two quality motors shipped seems right to me.

@jadatmag

Lower KV will give you more torque. 75KV
Higher KV will give you a higher top speed 90KV

You can also use a smaller wheel size for more torque.

We've also increased the stator size (for the upcoming pre-order) as well which would make them one of the biggest direct drive motors.

@jadatmag No, unfortunately only 75KV and 90KV. More torque doesn't always mean better. I think 75KV is a good medium balance. If you want, you can always drop to a 90mm wheel and get more torque from a 75KV setup. They are bigger why don't you be the judge :wink:

This is usually not suggested to do this, because most of the standard 170-190kv motors on 12S come really close or slightly over 60k ERPM.

With these though, the ERPM is so low, I'd guess it would be fine. Gotta ask someone smart like @Deodand what happens though if one motor goes faster than it should. 

When I hit max speed, I hit a limit where I can't go faster unless I let go of the throttle to coast faster. If I remember correctly though, that is an option in vesc tool to select... Gotta check. This might lock you at the lower speed. Maybe. I'm going to go look now. Maybe just keeping traction control disabled so your escs can run at different ERPMs without disabling the faster one.

I mean maybe the lower kv model might get smoked as it tops at 35mph. But as the only person currently riding a set, I'd say this thing can almost smoke a dual 6355 belt drive. The 90kv and custom wound motors at higher kv's should be beasts though, I'm guessing 90kv 40-48mph, custom 120kv's probably 50-60+mph

Are wheels going to be done in time to ship with the DD for people who ordered both or is it going to be more o like sending the DD's out once they're ready and then sending the wheels out as they become available and you guys get more stock of them?

@jansen I'd say maybe 2-4 weeks so sometime mid-late Feb. Could be earlier.

As far as the 110s we would ship out the DD ahead of time and send out the 110s when they are available.

Unfortunately, for 110s we also need a 4 week curing time for the wheels but they are almost on schedule but we'll have to see once they are poured.

**Update:** Sorry guys, bad news. Manufacturers actually ended up making 35D instead of 50D Baseplates. :cry:  For most decks, 35D would cause wheelbite so they'll have to create new ones.

Most of everything should arrive soon so we'll pretty much only be waiting for the 50D Baseplates + 110 Wheels.

So ETA should be around March unfortunately.

@sn4pz Yeah pretty silly mistake lol. Funny thing is we were only making 50x 35D Baseplates as an optional upgrade. :man_facepalming: I'm sure there not happy about it either.

You could.. I forget the square size for the Trampa Trucks. I'd imagine though the axle length is much longer so not sure it would fit entirely to be honest. Our axle length is standard axle length. Might be more work than necessary.

@Skunk Yeah, we'll have them for those who want them.

Would like to pre-order this weekend! Personally ride very aggressive and appreciate (rely on) precision of trucks. Mostly enjoy carving and taking quick sharp turns fast as I can.

Question before pulling the trigger: @torqueboards
 
1. Will these trucks be suitable for fast carving/turning?
2. Can I get away using 85mm Kegel‚Äôs?
3. What‚Äôs the approximate top speed for 75kv with 10s4p? (85mm wheels)
4. Safe/reliable for a 10s4p li-ion battery?

Please let me know, these look badass üòà

[/quote]

The motor diameter is 70mm, so 85mm wheels will fit, but you won't have much clearance between the ground and the motors. Then again, that's always the case with small wheels, so decide for yourself. With my Caguama belt setup, I have around 12.5mm clearance between the ground and the belts, which seems to be fine. The motors and motor mounds will get scratched by pebbles either way.

In your case though, a 15mm difference in diameter will mean 7.5mm clearance between the motor and ground. I believe that's small enough where your motor will be constantly pushing small pebbles and debris out of the way. Unless you live somewhere with superb quality roads, I would go for bigger wheels / a different drive train. (Still waiting for swissboards.ch to come online :fist: ) 

P.S.
I get 24.2 mph (39kmh) in the calculator with your specs. Perhaps you forgot to change gear ratio to 1:1 ?

@niv 
1. Yes, should be great for fast carving/tuning. We are also using all riptide bushings.
2. 85mm would fit but I wouldn't use it. The motors would be way too low to the ground. 90, 97, 100, 107, 110 would all be better options.
3. 12S on 75KV is about 35mph. 10S would be a bit under that.
4. Yes, I'd use 10S/12S ideally.

Depends on your definition of efficiency. Per volt, a belt drive motor will produce more torque than a direct drive. Not that I like belt drive. Just that by putting a higher kv motor under gear reduction, you can achieve more torque per volt. I would assume based on that, a belt drive would get better efficiency.

I was doing about 20 miles on my 12s4p with a belt setup before, I'm getting roughly the same on the direct drive, if not a bit more. I find that you use a bit less energy than a belt drive, the 1:1 gear ratio means you get a really true roll like on a regular longboard. If you let go of your remote you don't feel yourself lose speed like on a belt drive, the extra tension in the belt drive actually costs more energy. I'd reckon I can get a few extra miles on the directs versus my belts, but I'd say they pretty closely compete.

FYI: I'm a fast rider so a slower rider would probably get more range than me

Oh and for the 35mph Dexter mentioned, keep in mind that's based on the current beta motors which are wound as 6355's when the final product will be wound for 6374. You might be able to get a bit more speed on the final product IMO than the current beta drives. I'm running on torqueboards vescs, torqueboards 12s4p 30q, sensorless, BLDC.

Coasting drag will be better on hubs. obv. However ,they'll have greater losses uphill and on quickstarts.
Havn't done the math but I'd say it depends on where you're rididing regarding total efficiency.

Sure, there are many variables. The fair comparision would be if the size of the motors were atleast similiar and 5055 hubs wouldn't be very viable in the real world. But if you had a pair, they'd prob coast better then the belt setup

Yes you heard correct, he's sending me the production 75's soon to compare as well. Top speed on TB 4.12's on 12s with 30 amps per motor (bldc) was 35mph, top on unity at 60A per motor (foc) about 38mph. Considering the beta stators are 55's I'd imagine you ought to see 3-5mph more top speed on production models, plus more overall torque.

Typically a larger stator means a higher wattage which is why my top speed on dual 6355 belts is much lower than the same 190kv on a dual 6374.

If you've seen my race with Robin from lazy rollers at about 10 minutes in: https://youtu.be/b_uqtqzmRPQ

you'll note that our builds are nearly identical, he's on 12s5p with dual focboxes on 55's while I'm on 12s4p dual TB 4.12's on 6374's, both 190kv motors. He gets smoked by me at the end and can't catch up. All the love Robin! ‚ù§

IDK what kind of setup you guys have but numbers stands. Same kv same gear ratio same top speed. Except slight variation from heat. But if you do get higher top speed I wonder why. Let us know how it goes.

Not true. Resistance of wire and current draw at max speed will affect the top speed even if you have the same kv and gearing ratio. Let me know if you want to go into the math.

Lower resistance wires would provide more speed too? Less voltage drop across them so more to the motor?

People say in use ideally you want the motor to run at about 85% of the no load speed with a load.  If ur running under that with a load maybe want to decrease the load somehow for better efficiency or get a bigger motor.  if you‚Äôre doing higher than 80% with a load you‚Äôre doing well with the motor size to load ratio.

precisely!

You also have to consider the **battery internal resistance** to calculate the net voltage "available" to the motors . A heavier person/higher wind resistance/going up a slope, all require higher current at a given speed and hence you have noticeably less net voltage to the motor hence less top speed. Also because of the current as the heat builds up, the winding resistance increases significantly, thereby also affecting the top speed. 

You can test it out by carrying a 20Kg backpack  / going up a hill / putting a cardboard on you chest to increase wind resistance.

When I ordered they said the torque was about the same for both models. They mostly recommend the 75kv out of safety concerns (honestly 35mph is fast enough) not because of they think anyone would be unhappy with the torque of the 90kv, but I obviously can‚Äôt be sure till I get my order.

@BruSkater Torque should be perfectly fine on 90KV. We haven't extensively tested it but should be perfectly fine. I could see if we were using like 120KV then it would be a bigger difference.

75KV was testing a bit faster than 35mph+ as well. But yeah, if you got a 4WD. Try the 90KV 2WD first.

@McErono We're shipping out by order.

@Didsomeone Should be soon. Production should start within the week. We'll be testing out the new adapters for it also.

FYI - It is better/easier to ship these DD's with the 110s installed as we are shipping the DD Kits pre-assembled. If you do want to switch to Kegel Adapters and 110s and currently have ABEC. Please let us know. Especially for international. It would ship safer that way.

Is it close to Surf Rodz baseplates perchance?

I am curious... I should have tested when I had a set in hand temporarily, if it's the pivot cup that doesn't fit or the distance between pivot and kingpin.

Either way I'm not bummed at all, the baseplates are solidly designed and the fit between kingpin and baseplate was perfect.

@Sender - No, I don't think so.

Kind of hard to be compatible with everything unless you have swappable pivot cup seats.

If there is interest. I was planning on selling the precision trucks for about $179.99 same price as SurfRodz and we can have multiple axles/baseplates/colors.

Still need to finish up the adj baseplate but I worked on it a bit.

SR adjustable baseplates are $150 by themselves. Then another $120 or more for the rest.

Would $179 be with adjustable baseplates?

That would be a smart move...  many hybrid options. More and more builds popping up like this.

And there would be even more if there were some more readily available adjustable options.


Anyways.... yeah I want some!



I didn't expect them to be compatible with anything, just hoping it had a magically worked out as such.

@Pedrodemio It's standard sensor wire. Not directly for VESC.

@Jansen I believe, yours is going out.

**UPDATE** - We're pretty much out of stock. We have a new production run starting soon trying to get it done as soon as we can. Not everyone I believe, will be able to get their's yet and will have to be pushed to batch #2. There were some motors that had a slight tolerance issue. We'll try and see if we can get those going though. I assume, most of those people aren't from the forum specifically. For any updates or questions, you can email us.

I won't be doing it but I want to see how beat up these things can get. Someone with 83mm flywheels @longhairedboy? should take their set with small wheels and tear them up till they die. Those fliess DDs had wheels on them basically the same size as the cans. If these hold up to as much abuse as those things, I'll be super impressed.

I do plan on tossing some 90mm flywheels on mine to try it out. I'm not too worried about clearance, the cans seem pretty resilient. Oh, plus all the more reason for riptide to ship some urethane heatsink can sleeves! ü•∞

Not trying to derail the topic, but I really don't get it, is it too hard to change the polarity of the NTC with the manufacturer of your motors? Most of the customers will use VESC

Genuine question, it was a pain having to open the motor and install my own sensors

Just got back from a 14km test. This things are amazing, even at 90kv with 110s torque is huge. It got scary being so high, so top speed was like 26mph.
Silly me had only 50% battery charged, so at the end of the ride was sagging a lot, these things are hungry. Also, motors where cool to the touch after 30mins constant ridding. 

One question, when I was sagging if I gave it full throttle I would have cutouts, is that because I was at the battery cutoff or is not normal?

Edit: Just realized that had configured the remote on a slower mode and then selected the faster one. Now it's all good!

Just got my motors, had a few questions/concerns. Firstly, one of the motors is held firmly onto the truck while the other will easily slide off. I'm not sure if this was a mistake in building them or if it really will even be a problem, just something odd i noticed. The second this is that while trying to put some abec 11 flywheels onto the motors it seems the rod that goes into the bearings is to great a diameter to slide on. Is this a problem or do i need different size bearings?

Is there any rotational play? If they just slide on and off that should be just fine. Rotational play will be okay as well, but I'd suggest shimming with some shrink wrap or electrical tape the faces that are furthest apart (between motor and hangar).

Are you saying it doesn't go in or it's just a very good fit that it doesn't easily slide in?
If it's the latter then it's actually a good thing. The better the fit, the uniform the forces on it and the longer it will last.

@gmurad @FranciscoV - PM me. Sorry guys. Really thought we had enough. :(

@jbruce DD Motor Seating - That's just a tolerance difference it's perfectly fine and designed that way. Should be fairly loose the other ones that are tight should a bit loose. Just as long as you're motor stator doesn't rotate.

Axles - We use standard bearings. You might need to fit them on. Originally, we got these shafts at 8.03mm (they f'ed up) and had to sand them down to 7.98mm, etc so that way we can get the orders out rather than waiting longer. They should fit great but if you need too. You can sand it down a bit. If any issues, let us know.

ABEC Adapters are a bit tight. You may need to remove part of the abec core it's very minimal about less than 1mm. I had to use a mallet. They fit ABEC Clones perfectly though.

@jbruce do you have verniers / micrometers or any way to measure the shaft properly ?

Generally with machining due to deflection it's not uncommon to have a minor taper and if hand sanding it's hard to get it spot on. You need to know which part of the shaft is oversize so where to sand.

If possible remove the drive off the hanger or just get a loose 608 bearing and see if you can slide it onto the shaft. You want to remove all other variables, it sounds like the ABEC adapters are a bit tight so hopefully your not sanding the axle down if the fitment issue is with the adapter

If not you could do a redneck solution if the bearing goes on partway and get a sharpie and color in the shaft, try put the bearing on, where it interferes it will likely rub off the sharpie and that is where you need to sand. Rinse and repeat until your all done.

608 bearings are that common and have been around for that long that I would be honestly surprised if any where not 8mm +/- 0.001, they are ground finish so generally really good tolerance

If it won't go past the thread you may have a bur at the end, if you have an engineers file carefully add a chamfer at the transition. If you only have sandpaper get a piece of wood, put the sandpaper over the edge and use that to add the chamfer. You want to avoid just sanding the whole axle if it's just a bur at the transition

@torqueboards what is the thread length on these ?

Thinking pretty much all cordless drills will have a big enough chuck diameter wise to take these axles, if the thread section was short enough could just pop one end in the cordless drill and get the axle not the thread and use the drill to carefully spin the hanger while you hold some sand paper on the axle on the other side. Still a bit barbaric but better than sitting there trying to manually sand the axles

A lathe would make it a 2 minute job, but guessing since jbruce doesn't have any measuring tools guessing doesn't have a lathe either :stuck_out_tongue: Edit, lathe would only be to hold and spin the hanger, if taking 0.03mm off then would still stick to sandpaper

ok thank you, ill keep trying this in the meantime maybe with different sandpaper. Is axle the whole truck minus the motors?  because if so i'm only able to get one motor off so im not sure how i would replace the axle.

Some are a tight fit. You can just take a rubber mallet and knock it on the back side of the motor where it says the KV and the motor will come off :smile: I would just be sending you 4x Axles.

These issues and solution suggestions are being discussed in an incredibly civil manner ! My set should arrive Monday/Tuesday and I'll double check everything is OK myself. Fortunately i have the tools to make any mods needed. Can't imagine this being discussed so sensibly on any other non DIY forum. Seems people here are accepting of new tech/first batch teething problems üòÉ

Can't wait to fit mine ! Since i bought the 110s in an assembled unit i should be good to go anyway, but also got the ABEC adapters for completeness. Will bear all this in mind should i ever switch the wheels over.

Haha thanks for all the support guys, I'm just tryna be as helpful as possible and it's easier for me to fix it than have dex send out a new part. I can try and use a few more curse words here and there if i'm being too nice.

After a little bit of work I managed to sand down the axles so they fit the bearings. It wasn't that bad after i pulled off both of the motors and base plate from the truck, stuck it in my drill and went ham. Seems like I wont need new axles @torqueboards but I have a feeling the majority of ppl buying these wont wanna do this job, it does take some effort.

Which screws on the motor do you need to  remove to change the adapter? I took off the 6 torx screws kn the front plate but the adapter wont come off. Do i need to take out these small hex screws?

I‚Äôm not sure what type it was, just had it lying around. Remove both motors from the axle then take the axle part of the truck off of the base plate and stick one of the axle ends into a drill and tighten the drill Hold sandpaper on the other axle while spinning it. Takes some time so be patient.

@Jansen send us an email so we can take a look at it.

@AlanZhou Yours should of been sent out recently.

@kaaaaahle Don't take off the side hex screws as those are meant to keep the front motor cap on. Just the 6 TORX bolts you would need to remove. They are a tight fit so you'll need a rubber mallet to knock the pulley out and maybe a small screwdriver to lift it up. You also shouldn't have to deal with the axle issue. jbruce issue should of been a one-off issue.

@mikenyc Motors sit on the truck hanger and everything is press-fitted with the locknut.

I inititally mocked out drop through mounting on the Hummie... It looked like you had a little under .5 inches between the deck and the top of the motor. You would definitely have to sand out a motor well to make it work... I didn't feel comfortable with the amount of material that would have the be sanded and the structural integrity that would be compromised.

If you look at the first picture... you can see that with a top mount... it's about 1.25 inches from motor to the bottom of the deck. The deck itself is about .75 inches... if you routed out a spot to flush mount... you might get back .125 inches... Feel like it's not enough room

You probably be fine, try first without routing the board and making the wells if necessary

I have routed mine to make the trucks leveled and had no problems so far

@finges same as I said above, if you routed so the truck being flat you will probably be ok even with deep wells, bet way to do this is to attach a sandpaper to the motor and run it slowly

The Hummie deck is really thick compared to normal decks and still have two carbon fiber layers inside

Thanks for the advice. With a little elbow grease i got the adapters changed and the axle sanded down so that the wheels would go on. So just fyi not sure its a one off problem.

Either way, i mounted my 90mm flywheels on, and im not sure if i have enough ground clearance. Anyone have an opinion on that?

![20190409_204100|690x388](upload://7smRkRlTLY3ElKyQoyYloSBoGMo.jpeg)

Ok i am not trying to hijack this thread so tell me togo somewhere else... but i need some of your collective expertise. 
The torque board 75 kw are rated at 4000w per motor. 
The carvon xl are Dual 85kv sensored motors, 2750W each
I getbthat the lower kw are better for torque, which is what i want.  But hiw do you compare these two systems?  
Is the Torqueboard DD faster higher torque with the lower 75kw / 4000w
But the Carvon are 85kw amd lower 2850W. 
So can someone explain this to me. It will guide my purchace of the TBdd.

```
Kv is the inverse of kt which tells torque per amp.  A motor of any size and a lower kv will put out more torque per amp, so u could have an elephant sized motor with 90kv and a baseball size motor at 80kv and the smaller motor will put out more torque per amp.   It will have greater electrical resistance so be more inefficient and possibly get so hot as to ruin the motor but for a short period it will put out more 

Unless u put a lot of current in the big and small motor (both w 90kv and let‚Äôs say 100 amps) the smaller motor will magnetically saturate the iron of the stator and it won‚Äôt be able to convert all those amps to torque as it should so while kv and kt tell how much torque u get per amp, there‚Äôs THAT limitation and ALSO km, which reveals torque to heat produced generally in the windings

So peak torque decided by kt (kv) and how much iron available, and continuous decided by the km of the motor and what heat it‚Äôs capable of getting to before it destroys magnets or windings or bearings

The copper windings increase their magnetic field strength without any limitations other than the resistance of the wire and burning up.  The electrical steel of the stator can support about 1.6 Tesla magnetic field strength before the relationship goes south and instead heat is increasingly produced.  So a motor w no steel wouldn‚Äôt suffer from magnetic saturation but then it will also take a huge amount of current and much electrical resistance with many coils to get close to the field strength helped with the steel

Most of them have a steel flux ring behind the magnets in the rotor.  If they don‚Äôt theyre wasting their magnets and not containing their field.  Steel behind the magnet will greatly increase its pull force.  For motors at the peak of performance they might use a carbon rotor and a hallbach array with the magnets.  Less weight

There‚Äôs simulations on that main magnet page. Forget the name. But I found it way off and a lot more gets out. It‚Äôs a huge loss and if for example the motor used a 3mm thick flux ring it will greatly increase the pull of the magnets and then u could compensate for that on the stator side with less coils and therefore less electrical resistance.   It‚Äôs like getting a 250kv motor, with few coils and lower electrical resistance, and pressing on a 2mm steel sleeve and dropping it to 190kv.  

All these thin steel back irons we see with out runners are maybe good for a plane saving weight but for a motor on a board the thicker the better.  Especially a DD rolling along the road for protection

Makes sense. Well I don't think most of the motors are more than 1mm steel. At least not the one I have. Good that I used 3mm mild steel. A pain to make it but seems worth it. Thanks for the explanation. Always super nice talk with you.

Ok fellas....  starting to get a little concerned here (on top of major FOMO) with this situation Dexter.... @torqueboards I have emailed you guys 1-2 times a day going on the 3rd day today, your chat feature online isn't ever up and working when I look (which is 3-4 times a day) so I'm coming back here to hopefully get some type or response or help from you guys bro.... I should have my order in hand and my build complete but now my stuff i    s sitting god knows where in a different state and I'm stuck here dreaming still and have no idea what's going on since you guys shipped it to the please. I really don;t want to get left out of this first batch and don't think that's fair at all so can I please get a response today (haven't gotten one yet since I first reached out Money) on what we are going to do. If I need to get the 75kv or the 50 degree truck instead of what I ordered just to be able to get everything then that is fine with me and I was already contemplating that anyway. PLEASE let me know ASAP what's going on. I just want my drives and wheels man!!!! Thanks brotha.

Got a test ride in figured I share. 12s4p 90kv 90mm popocas 200 lb rider with gear got me 19 mi on spirited riding with headwinds it felt like everywhere to getting into battery cut off. https://strava.app.link/WjA1jJQYPV.  Torque feels really good on them but I only have a 10s setup to compare. I can say I'll be testing the durability of the cans xD ![IMG_20190412_161001|666x500](upload://2rzRanStbO1dd7DNkx09qDQpMGh.jpeg) . The only real issue I have is one the motors was loose I could pull it off and that one sounds like there a metal ring something loose but I couldn't find anything. The motor spins fine it just sounds different on spin up compared the other. Might just be that new setup overattentive to noises.

At least DHL deliver the goods first and send you a letter later with the Duty % fee. @torqueboards please consider providing an alternative shipping option to Europe other than USPS. It might be great for USA shipments but evidently not for UK. I'm not moaing at you, honestly, just might save you future headaches with less patient customers than myself.

I love it! Still have to refine a few things but man those big wheels are soft and comfy. Best ride quality I ever had. And grip is outstanding. Enough torque (did no hill climbs yet... tonight I will stress it). I even had wheelspin at the begining with the new wheels (75kv, 12s4p, 220lbs) for me its a perfect match with the hummie deck but its sooo huge! Weight is about the same as my falcon. Will have to get used to the unity because it feels totally different than ack wattmode.

Yes my falcon is 12s dual 6374 but its 97mm vs 110mm wheels and I had to use ACK firmware on the belt board to smooth it out so a direct comparison is not easy. All I can say is I am not going full throttle at once with the 75kv DD yet (like I did instantly with the raptor 2.1) and that tells me there is quite some torque going on.

I only did a short test and not much faster than 40kph (have a trust issue with that eskating.eu/maytech remote...). can't say much about it but it was very stable although the bushings are too soft for my 220lbs and I had to tighten them way too much (have to replace them with harder ones). The hummie deck is so wide and big maybe thats a factor because I never had such a big deck before, feels very safe.

@FredXanadu these are self designed and 3D printed X-things. The bumper is modified... forgot the name of the brand but will tell you, box is still somewhere...

Alright bud, we get it. You pre-ordered a new product that is still unknown from an indi developer on the internet. The support you get from Dexter and his team will define the quality of what you bought and if TB history is anything to go by these teething issues will only happen once.

Calm it down, ask for help, get help, ride off into the sunset.

@McErono @epss4 @Ubbiedude The axles were originally 8.03-8.05mm. We had to sand them down to about 7.98-8mm. If you are using different bearings or purchased an ABEC set and we didn't install the wheels this issue might be more apparent.

You may have to sand the axle shaft. Put it on a drill collet and turn on the drill using 80 grit sandpaper or a bit more.

It was either that or everyone wait until the new axles are made. I'm sure, nobody wanted to wait any longer and some people have to wait longer. So we made the decision to send it out.

I will have new axles if anyone wants new axles but obviously there's a wait time.

@Ubbiedude They are standard. Clockwise to tighten. Counterclock to untighten. righty tighty lefty loosey. Email us.

If you're having trouble removing the axle there's threadlock so you may need to put some elbow into it and/or heat it up a slight bit.

@rusins me and finges planed to mount it drop through but the motors are bigger than expected. 

[quote="finges, post:1032, topic:61152, full:true"]
I inititally mocked out drop through mounting on the Hummie‚Ä¶ It looked like you had a little under .5 inches between the deck and the top of the motor. You would definitely have to sand out a motor well to make it work‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the amount of material that would have the be sanded and the structural integrity that would be compromised.

If you look at the first picture‚Ä¶ you can see that with a top mount‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about 1.25 inches from motor to the bottom of the deck. The deck itself is about .75 inches‚Ä¶ if you routed out a spot to flush mount‚Ä¶ you might get back .125 inches‚Ä¶ Feel like it‚Äôs not enough room

In which case it might be the following week until these thing finally arrive.

USPS postal service is possibly the worst option that could have been used here. A heads up to anyone else thinking of importing these from outside the USA...... ask TB to send using a different service - pay the extra, it'll will be worth it for your nerves !!! :-)

No problem here with usps whatsoever this time. And no customs fees which I didn't expect. 

I did climb the steepest hill around today (really steep) and the thing flew up there like nothing. Felt like my belt drive... but silent. Brakes are impressive. I had to tone them down a bit (-53a/-15a) compared to the raptor 2.1 its not even funny... raptor was not able to climb the same incline and came to a stand still.

The motors do get hot though. Lunaci must be a lot lighter than me (who wonders me being 220lbs) to manage these mountainroads in her review video with handwarm motors.

No. It was a lazy build :innocent:

Hummie deck and mounted enclosure from bigben.
12s4p charge only bms, fuse, 4A torqueboards charger plug by pjotr.
DirectDrive and Bigwheels from Torqueboards.
Unity Enertion

So all I did is some modification on the enclosure (holes for switch and charging plug and a cutout to fit the truck baseplate), griptape, coating the matte hummiedeck with 2k, printing the x-things, soldering motor adapters, job done.

Its kind of my dreamboard and its not even more expensive than the raptor 2.1 on sale... which I am still waiting for a replacement since january.

@McErono - TB DD will climb up steep hills but the downside to it is because of the lack of gearing ratio it will create more heat when ran hard. Ideally, you don't want to keep climbing up really steep hills back to back as it will create more heat. Eventually, you can/may burn a motor out will probably take a while but it is possible. To safeguard, just make sure you don't get the motors "too hot" and you're golden.

@rideTastic - You just need 2x 3.5mm to 5.5mm wire adapters for the motor wires. 2x Sensor Wires to plug into the unity.

@Eskate444 - Batch 2 should be about 30 days ETA.

Nobody can tell you that because it depends on a million different things.

If you assume 25Wh/mile / 15Wh/km you can adjust from there based on your riding characteristics.  Also, I can go out and burn 12Wh/mile or on the same board and the same route, burn 35Wh/mile.  It depends a lot on how you ride, also.

In my case, if I continue to run 50km/h with Raptor2, it is about 15km.
  432/15 = 28.8 Wh/km.

I did a range test with my meepo v2 sanyo and got 22km.
Same track i got 14km with raptor 2.1 and i was only 7km/h faster on avg.

Going slower and/or kicking a tad from a standstill will increase your range far more than using a tuck, but that does help too.

If you treat the motors as a ski-lift instead of a musclecar, your range will increase very significantly.

As speed increases, the required power increases.
Even at 40 km/h and 47 km/h, the required power changes considerably.
As you say, there may also be a cause for the 2.1 motor.
if you want more speed and distance, I think increasing battery is the easiest solution.

@Lunasi can‚Äôt weigh more than 150 pounds, and I‚Äôd guess even less.

My 240 pounds and single 6374 metroboard was definitely one of the hot ones that didn‚Äôt go quite as far, but I‚Äôm sure the dual drive would have zippied me right up.

The 120 pound kids did alright on evolves, my 220 pound friends evolve motors were so hot I‚Äôm surprised damage wasn‚Äôt done.


The 55 mile metro would do a 30 mile ride in 2 hours (with a few 420 stops) and didn‚Äôt hit sag.

That's with moderately aggressive riding, 20mph avg speed, 31mph top speed, slowing and stopping for stop signs and lights, and flooring it to top speed as much as possible. I have a hard time believing Raptor hubs are 50% less efficient than that. :astonished:

I think the motor is fine but there is a bit of play between the truck and the motor that leads to the rattling sound.

But guys I am so impressed. I think I order another set just for a future build. There is nothing better than these things around at the moment.

Look at that machining. Built like a tank and beautiful. I really love them.

They are big. They may have a 6374 stator but are way bigger than a normal 6374 motor. Lots of metal, heavy duty stuff. They stay hot for a very long time after a ride (nothing bad in my opinion).

The R2.1 motors are very inefficient. Even compared to the old R2.0 motors you loose 20-25% range I guess.

Did a 7km run yesterday with two very steep but short inclines on my TB DD and my 12s4p reported 20% battery usage. (75kv 220lbs)![20190419_224533|374x500](upload://8CKT9rlxanbBJU6FrqYvF7NKgcm.jpeg)

I can't compare them side by side... waiting since january for a replacement raptor 2.1. And my TB DD is 12s so wouldn't be fair to compare them. All I can say is the 75kv TB DD has more than enough torque for me... most of the time I am cruising in slow mode (62% throttle) on steep inclines I use full power and it flys!

Another short run (can't get enough of this board and sneak out whenever I can...) 6km, 16% usage. So I estimate 35-40km range on full charge. Battery is brandnew and had only one full cycle yet.

I think I found the cause of the slightly noisy motor. I tried to tighten the tolerances with teflontape. it did lessen the clearance between the axle and the motor but had no effect on the sound of the motor.

I believe its the C-clip. The brownish ring in the picture. It was quite shifted to one side not in the center of the big bearing. Centered it as good as possible and the motor sounds much better now almost identical to the other one :+1:![20190421_025827|375x500](upload://akxqm1UTOcabIrG1CoT28axaYIt.jpeg)

I rode the beta set (grain of salt here) with Jeffery's second iteration low speed brake fix on Acks fw. Braking wasn't as strong as my belts at low speeds, kinda came to a slow coast at best. I did have current control, and if toggling reverse I could reverse into full stop just fine if I remember correctly. When toggling reverse though, the rotational play on one motor would lead to rattling at that point though, and I didn't have enough time with them to properly shim the rattles away fully.

In general, less aggressive slow speed breaking but smooth as hell. I'd love to hear other people's thoughts who have done the low speed break fix on their vescs with this first batch of motors.

I don't consider braking on the DD's an issue. 100kg/220lbs and I have strong enough brakes... I guess thats quite subjective. batt regen for highspeed brakes, max brake current for low speed brakes.

But I noticed I had stronger brakes unsensored which is strange and new to me. As soon as my sensors started working (bad hall sensor adaptercables) the brakes got a bit weaker.

Glad I did go with the 75kv with my weight.

I would also be really interested if some of the other users like @Toughook and @LEE would chime in. I mean its quite clear by now I love the TB DD's A LOT! did I already mention how awesome the really big wheels are? :wink:

Thanks @LEE sorry to hear about your brush with the law hopefully you get away with just a caution and keep your board, be very different story in my country. So your happy with the acceleration, do you find it strong all the way to 60kph, I'm about 55kg, do you recommend the 90kvs? 
 Sorry for picking your brains, I ordered the 90s, and am having that will I won't I argument with myself given I'm waiting on the second batch.

The beta drives were 28 magnets, or 14 pairs. I had to enter 28 into ESC Monitor to get accurate readings. I don't know the science or explanation behind this, and I never looked to verify but that worked for me after someone suggested I input 28 magnets on the DDs.

Nice, can't wait to hear how she rides. Please let's know, always the option to use different radius wheels to level the torque, if ground clearance is good enough. I calculate 110 vs 97 at 88% top speed, not that top speed it really important, and 90 vs 75kv at 83%.. Will be interested how you get on mate.

Probably I think that 75KV is good considering the total balance.
I think 90 KV is a choice for those who want speed.
At Raptor 2, 53 km / h, this was the highest speed ever for me.
I wanted a board that exceeded this.

I was satisfied for the time being over 60 kph.
I think the speed will increase a little more.
There was no wobble up to 60 kph.
The motor is smooth and fast.  And the truck that supports it is good as well.
Now, I think that a simple shopping that exceeds 60kph in one shopping is to buy a 90kV torque board direct drive.Or Bio boards.

59kph with 3D Servisas 2.4: 1 mini gear drive and 190KV6374motor and 107mm wheel.
This is excellent for hill climbing torque and braking.  Everyone will like this if it is practical.
Which to choose, practical or leisure?

It depends on where you go. I would avoid riding in Tokyo. Here in Osaka (Kansai), where I am located it's not so much of an issue. People using electric bikes (the self driving forbidden ones) on a daily basis, the law here isn't as strictly enforced as in the Kanto region. If you stay on small roads, are kind and respectful towards pedestrians with a stealthy board, I'd say it's fine. I am commuting on a daily basis for one and a half years without issues.

Hi,
Just a question: did you take the plane and go thru custom control with a board?
I am asking this question because last year I've been in trouble with batteries dedicated to underwater cam and lights from Gates 4 x  [lights](https://www.gateshousings.com/gt14-underwater-imaging-light/)
It was at Seattle we were doing a stop and go between Paris and Papeete to pick up friends that were coming from Toronto. Not to loose everything we had to forward it back to France with cargo flight. Hopefully it was at the arrival to Seattle, so we were with 36 hours to manage cargo, custom, taxes (with customs you always have to pay something)...
So now I am taking care with batteries and custom control.

There is no problem with braking. I had to dial them down, they are strong! What people are talking about is that at 1-3kmh the brakes do not lock the wheels which is a non issue for most. You are not getting to a stand still on a decline.

Belt drives with FOC do lock up at that speed and I hate it. There is a whole thread about it somewhere. So I clearly prefer the behaviour of the DD.

Finally got some data today. I was wearing a half shell, no pads on a unfamiliar board and remote I didn't trust myself to push faster. I would say I'm pretty impress by just the dual 90kv. I'm sure it would only get better when I complete the 4WD board. The wheels feels nice and soft but a little too big for my taste. Breaking is still the same, it's strong at speed but no low rpm break. It would put me to 5mph then I would have no break. This might be fine for some of you but definitely not ideal for San Francisco.

Setup is:
* Evolve Carbon Gen2
* Dual TB 90kv
* TB110
* 12s4p Sanyo 18650RX
* Unity
  * Motor 90/-60, batt 90/-30

**Data is recorded assuming 28pole pairs.**

First:
* distance - 2 miles of flats
* Speed - 20mph avg, 27mph top (only 68% duty)
* Efficiency - about 25Wh/mile avg (seems fair, I get around the same with Hummies)

https://metr.at/r/b1oaC
 

Second: 
* Distance - 0.5 miles steep uphill (California St, sections of 11,12,15% grade)
  * ![IMG_20190423_233728|234x500](upload://6ITcpqGOiXlLbGx4lP7H0Mxk45w.jpeg) 
* Speed - avg 14mph, 24mph top
* Efficiency - 75Wh/mile avg
* Temp - ~80F >>>120F (not so bad considering the speed I was riding up this hill)

![IMG_20190423_233931|234x500](upload://3jhNTNn2JecNawSiERgh7drm2Lp.jpeg)![IMG_20190423_234402|690x323](upload://oM1N0xNUKtTKiXevcigvvyU67Fm.jpeg)

P.S. forgot to mention and this is actually pretty important. Right after I got on top of the hill. One of the motor suddenly had a lot more resistance than the other. I felt it because the free coasting was a lot worse and then I hand spun it and found out. Not sure if it was a over heat issue because it could still spun with the throttle. But after a while it went back to normal. Maybe a bearing ~~ceased~~ seized?

Thanks, for the time given to this report.

Is it possible to get some pictures to see in operational setting free spaces between road and motors and compare with an geared, hub and belted one?

When I was doing some tests for other activities I was using a small fingerprint of white water paint or Tipp-Ex Shake'n Squeeze to check in real condition if there are contacts with the ground.
It was for competition karting during 80's, but we can do the same to check in real condition the "stone tolerance"? 

Do you agree?

looks like you can't imagine how big these direct drives are in real life. thats almost an inch between can and floor! several pencils fit under there.

the motor can is 70mm, the wheels are 110mm, hence 20mm clearance on each side! more than enough for everything.

and you are hitting stones all the time - no problem at all. never ever encountered a stone that could stop me. 220lb, 110mm wheels... poor stone.

We are working on it as fast as we can.

Tightening the nut helps with the bearing movement, but at the cost of rolling resistance.

The other drive doesn't move even if I loosen the nut.

Yeah probably better to not mention dates. I felt particularly wronged because of the email saying that it would be in stock, even confirmed in chat that it would ship next week with first batch if I ordered. Also there seems to have been a lot of QC issues with the first batch so I lost confidence for now.

Don't get me wrong, I do wish all of this is worked out and it becomes a great choice in the near future. I see the potential.

Hi AlanZhou,

I am novice with e-sk8, but I am an engineer for 26 years working for car, plane, military industries.
I can tell you that when something is supposed to rotate and get different constraint you are going to get heat, vibrations, so your efficiency and resilience will be worst....
Do a test: dry-run for 15 minutes at 30-50% of charge. Every 30 seconds you collect the temperature of both DD.
if running the test twice the same DD is heating more than it's twin brother, you are in a bad situation.
It is important to run the test at low to mid speed, as the data you want to collect are unwanted heat in relation with frictions.

Hi,

Without a near shaky rear motor, I would say that he gets enough range to write the request on a paper and bring it himself using his e-sk8 to mountain view, to get the answer. 

But with a shaky motor there is no chance to complete his Silk City & Dua lipa's culture...

I was not able to imagine that DD could get a negative edge effect on San Francisco bay's culture....

Hey Guys, I got my setup together and mostly running except for one problem... I can't start from a standstill. If I give a little push it all seems to be fine. If I'm not on the board it takes off like a rocket. I haven't tested any further than my living room for more than 15-20 FT for fear of killing my board. @torqueboards or anyone else with some knowledge; Do you have any recommendations for changing my settings? Maybe theres a more relevant thread for me to read? I followed the tutorials closely, but obviously something is still off. 90kv on 124

PS Dying to get this working properly. Its an amazing setup.

Ok. Thanks for the recommendation. I can see how the carpet could be a problem for a smooth start especially under weight. I‚Äôll try when I get back from work. My concern was the ‚Äúchucking‚Äù noise when the motors initiated a roll. But maybe that‚Äôs because of the rolling resistance of the carpet? Once I gave a little push they worked perfectly. If I just needed to man up and put it on the pavement that would be hilarious. They have some good torque though. No kidding they had me popping wheelies pretty consistently if I jammed on the throttle after a push. 

@Pura-Vida I‚Äôm happy to post more pics. Didn‚Äôt want to overwhelm the thread with pics or my customer service issue.  I‚Äôll snap a few tonight. I don‚Äôt have too many stills on me, but I can post high res for now. In the CU shot of the motors and trucks if you‚Äôre wondering what the black rubbery gasket thing is, it‚Äôs just that. A handmade rubber gasket to seal off the hardware. The Moonshine Hooch has some pretty deep concave and it took allot of material to fill the gaps between the board and the cover. You can see in the other pic the orange gasket around the seam. It came out pretty well. Wish I had an ‚Äúoverhead‚Äù shot. I love the way the trucks complement the ‚Äúwooden spoon‚Äù shape of the board. Very snowboard feeling, carving friendly. It feels like a rocket; makes you want to jump on it and take off. Hopefully all I needed to do is not puss out and take to the tarmac, because I‚Äôm ready to tear it up with this thing.

I‚Äôm running un-sensored at the moment. But I did of course do a motor detection and applied and saved the values.

personally, for the TB 110s I bought that are on the TB DD @Winfly is using, I like Tektons:

https://seismicskate.com/product/wheel_bearings_tekton_ceramic/

super-precise and tolerances keep dirt out.

daily drivers are low precision, so to keep dirt out, I prefer grease as it keeps dirt out better than oil.

https://stokedrideshop.com/products/dragon-bearings-for-longboards-and-skateboards

The 'Endure' type uses the same grease as Hamboards, etc.  The only drag is they don't come with spacers.

Hope this helps.  TB DD FTW. :)

Yeah, that is kinda ridiculous. It makes sense to use light lubricant when you are pushing. When it's a vehicle, I don't understand why people are so anal about reducing bearing drag. In the grand scheme of things it's not a significant factor in efficiency. 

I prefer the thick grease bearings because they last a long long time.

TorqueBoards is awesome... Dexter is awesome...  buy his many wares... hehe

... I've found that you can "reset" just about any longboard or motor bearing with Reel Butter Bearing Lube.

https://www.amazon.com/Ardent-Reel-Butter-Bearing-Lube/dp/B001H54MCO

Reel Butter isn't magic, it's not going to dissolve a tiny rock or anything, yet if you do clean them and flush them with this stuff.. well, even with the most expensive, crazy high-end ceramics I've ever had, always, very noticeable improvement with Reel Butter over the lighter oils.

Bones Speed Cream is still 4.5/5 tho :) good hunting!

Well, it should should have a service schedule(like a car) based on hours used/distance travelled. Metr pro is the best tool for that now. Just like a car it shouldn't have to be oiled every 6 hours of use.

Hello Torqueboards, 

Is it specific to e-sk8 to sell pre-production releases and  to expect customers to run qualification for free?

Don't worry, I like the way this activity is progressing...
just want to know in such case, how are you managing the sensor issue?

Because it is one thing to run test when you know that your hardware is not yet dry and you are getting updates to fix the bugs, and another thing to stay into your garage with hardware that are not responding as expected and you pay as production one...

When the customer sold out is order, did he do it with garage printed money? 

Sorry, I am not Apple nor Tesla fan, for the second one his cars have to loose at least half of the weight to be efficient.

I prefer Android, and phone players from China to balance US imperialism as EU is dead on IT.

@rideTastic correct + sensor wires if you use the unity. https:///products/wire-extensions-3-5mm-to-5-5mm

I'd get the 110mm TB Wheels as we may be switching our current Pneumatic Rims to a Kegel style setup. That way you have a quick swap setup. :scream:

Because of the 110mm wheels I don't know if that would be too slow for me? I only have a 10S4P battery and waiting atm for the 75kv DD. With 110mm I wouldn't have so much torque so I chose the 97mm. Or am i wrong?

You can use 97mm. You'll get more torque from 97mm than 110.

The wire extensions/adapters or the bullet connectors either works. If you don't need the extra length those connectors work fine.

QQ.. what's the overall max temp magnets and epoxy rated for? hummie's can to up to 250F. If it's over 200F I don't think we would have any problem beside not being able to read temp data.

```

## \#1450 Posted by: torqueboards Posted at: 2019-04-28T19:12:12.968Z Reads: 246

```
Should be able to do 200F. I've burned out a few small motors in the past. You can feel it before it happens.

While you're riding the motor will struggle and typically the time it burns out is when you're climbing or scaling a hill and you stop and dump more amps on it in the middle of a hill. If you push it past that level it's toast. If you stop get off the board and walk up the rest of the hill. You'll save your motor. Let it cool down and ride again.

So best thing if you're going up a hill is to keep the momentum. Don't lose the momentum. Losing the momentum will put more stress/heat on the motors (any motors).

Typically, I think it's hard to burn out a motor on flat ground mostly uphill/downhill will you get all the added heat.

TB DD has quite a quite bit of cooling so I don't have SF hills anymore but you guys do. Test it and let me know.

So I'd climb a decent hill 1-2 times, how hot do the motors get? then climb the same hill again 3-4, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8.. 8-9.. .etc... 

If they always stay warm. you should be good to go.. If you know past 8-9 hard climbs they are pretty hot.. After 8-9 hard climbs stick to flats for 10-15 mins to let them cool.

If they never get hot enough for your standard routes... then you gravy. :smile:

Enclosure is [eboosted EVO40DS](https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/landyachtz-evo-39%E2%80%B3-ds-v2-4wd-applications/).  Very robust and easy to use.
The gasket is neoprene.
The use of a thick gasket slightly increases the capacity within the enclosure and provides more freedom in cell alignment.
Enclosures for double stack can be stacked with Unity and thin charge only BMS.
Thicker gaskets make this easier.

I will not use the AT wheel with direct drive.
The AT wheel is used for drive with gear ratio.
Riser is back and forth self-made 3d printing.

Initial review time. I just finished the Maryhill event, and it was so amazing. Completely closed course, well organized and well supported with food provided and EMT support which was put to good use. I had two boards, my Xerxes 14000 watt 4wd (actually laid down 12000 watts!) an my torqeboards direct drive. Had zero issues with the Xerxes, FVescs got up to about 150 but no more, motors didn't seem too warm after really going for it up the 1.8 mile hillclimb. 

Now, to the Direct Drive. First braking and acceleration were absolutely a joy and so so so buttery smooth. Braking power was certainly sufficient with this 2wd setup power was very good considering I was running 12s4p through 4.12 Fvescs. When I was aggressive with my last hill climb, I found the limits of the system. I experienced several cutouts under hard uphill acceleration. The motors certainly did get very warm, but not so hot that I couldn't comfortably touch them. I suspect my vescs got a real workout though. I've experienced cutouts with these vescs on a completely different system so I'm inclined to think the vescs were at fault. In a couple weeks I'll be getting two FVESC 6.6's back from repair and then I'll know for sure. But almost certain the vescs were at fualt, or my vesc settings weren't ideal.

I'd really have to give the DD a high review, for their buttery smoothness, the fact that they build up a relatively light board (20lbs vs 30 for my other board). When you're coasting it feels a lot like a traditional longboard which is fantastic. However it means that you won't get the drag from the belts that helps limit downhill speed. For flat terrain, this board really shines, Certainly goes just about as fast as anyone might like to go uphill too.

Anybody that has 75kv want to trade me for my 90kv DD?

I realized at 13s 75kv I‚Äôll have more then enough speed... 40~ mph, so I realized might as well have the extra torque of the 75kv version

Hi AlanZhou, just to understand as e-sk8 is a new domain on which I have to collect knowledges and trainings, do you think that a 95 kg rider has to go to 75 kv rather than 90 kv for 2xWD if he wants to ride 0-40 mph on flat roads or <10% hills?
for you what is the best configuration 2WD 75 kv direct drive @ 110mm or go to geared motor 90 kv and inflatable wheels when your weight is 95 kg +/-5 kg? I will do more or less 20 to 30 km (2 ways travel) 5 day a week. average speed 30-40 kms expected. and weekend long rides except when wind will blow, as I am a kitesurfer, and e-skate purpose will to train my balance when kitesurfing is not possible (3h from home to ocean).

You wont hit 40mph soon... 30mph standing on a deck is already freaking fast for a newbie you will see. We are talking concrete not water. go 75kv if you plan 12s.

Do you want a less maintenance, smooth, silent board? -> DD, if not go belt driven.

It will certainly help! Wasn't on a skateboard for 25 years when I started eskating but I was/am still doing mtb downhill. Its all about that feeling.

I was just shocked how fast these things go. 60kmh on a bike is fine... you have that handlebar, real brakes. 40kmh on a skateboard feels a lot faster than it is and you have just less confidence while just standing on that thing. And then there are these goddamn speedwobbles :innocent:

I'm not pushing it. Never had a real crash yet on an esk8. Fastest I ever did was 50kmh with brown underpants.

I still haven't got my replacement raptor but it's an easy choice for me.

Motors that last so far, a cushy backtruck with lots of urethane, more range, same or more power (still vague because of the thermalthrottling back in january but thermalthrottling at -2¬∞C is strange anyway) and then there is the hummiedeck which I love and no batterysag.

100m steep incline. The raptor came to a stop about half way up. Lots of battery sag and one motor over 100¬∞C within seconds. The TB DD does the same incline with ease several times and is accelerating from bottom to top.

The dual 6374 belt driven board has more torque and never ever got into temp issues. But its loud, not as smooth and in Switzerland I need a stealthy board.

Let's not forget the lesson Matt McCrary taught us. He didn't worry about falling because he "could outride most of you" here. Then he made himself the guinea pig for what can happen when do you do go down at 30+mph with no pads or armor. At least he wore his helmet though. Needless to say, he's not around here much anymore and his last posts were selling off his boards. When gearing up for a ride, I always remind myself that this hobby/sport/transportation is too damn fun to ruin it with injuries...especially avoidable ones. Stay safe.

I'll chime in and say that a fall at 40+mph doesn't have to be the end of the world. Maybe I just got lucky but everytime I fell at 40+mph, but it was never really that bad.

This conversation tracks the main idea- wear pads. Most critical ime has been slide gloves and kneepads, and helmet obviously. With slide gloves and knee pads, I've never ended up with more than a few bits of road rash here and there, always got back up to keep skating. All this, minus the times smashing myself into a guard rail or car or something.

I just went through this about a month ago. I've had road rash plenty of times skating, but this was the worst. This was the first time I didn't let it scab. Instead keep the wounds clean and moist and they will heal faster. Daily fresh dressing and petroleum jelly.

Drying wounds and letting them scab is regurgitated advice from the 40s. It's clinically proven that you will heal faster with moist, covered wounds. Scarring is also significantly reduced. 

You can even heal up/reduce a decade old scar by moisturising and plastering it for a month. This is common modern medical knowledge that just doesn't seem to have found it's way into western homes for some strange reason.

Agreed. It's a pain in the ass to clean and redress so frequently (I did twice a day) but it definitely healed faster than any other road rash injury I've had.  Doesn't look like there will be any scarring either, which is incredibly good news for me considering im getting married in a month and my fiance would have killed me.

I used to work as a Surgical Tech and I exclusively use Tegaderm regardless of injury. Faster recovery and less scarring but you do have to watch out and drain exudate. There are products that design around this and absorb excess drainage, but they can get pretty pricy.

Oh, also some body parts are not compatible with Tegaderm, specifically, hands and feet. They sweat too much and cause the adhesive to prematurely fail. It's possible to use Benzoin to increase adhesive strength, but it is also an irritant.

I got the new axle stubs fitting standard bearings. :+1:

![20190510_120820|666x500](upload://dYrz2HviCYO1irltOVf6Y6R09c0.jpeg) 

They wont fit the reverse-cored 110mm wheels at the back. So if you want to change bearings at the back you need to sand down the current stubs or buy new 110mm wheels with a regular core.

Guys,

Do you know if AT wheels could fit the DD ? And if yes which one ? Would the torque be enough to go uphill (with a 12s5p pack)? 75 or 90kv ?

Thanks

I'd guess going 75Kv with AT tires would be your best bet. Depending on the diameter of the tires, I'm sure 12S5P will have enough torque to make it up hills. 

Dexter is in the process of making some kegel cored AT wheels for the DDs, you could wait for that or design and 3D print some adapters for other AT hubs.

@torqueboards I've set my max battery amps to 60 per motor, and max motor amps to 85. When looking at my mtr pro telemetry, it seems I often have spikes to around a 100 motor amps, and have fairly frequent spikes to 90. Wanted to get feedback on what these motors can handle, I sure don't want to burn them out! Motor Temps don't seem to get beyond "quite warm, but touchable"

@youseekcota Current TB DD Batch #1 doesn't have the proper hall sensor pcb so it doesn't record temps so not too sure.

As long as the motor doesn't get hot you should be good. You'll only burn them out if they get way too hot so if they are warm. You're not close to burning them out. Typically, the easiest way to burn out the motors is climbing steep hills without momentum, back to back.

@skatardude10 I was going to do the Kegel Core but that will have to come around later. I decided to push through anyways with the current as changing now will delay the AT wheels way too long :sob:

@ThomasL If you do go with the AT wheels, make sure you go with 75KV. We haven't tested yet but it should be decent enough.

@AlanZhou - You should email us. Wrong channel for any updates like that here.

Just finished a ride. So stoked, cannibalized my Xerxes to run my DD 12s6p with dual Flipsky 6.6's. Yowza! Got up to a little over thirty and had lots of throttle left. Motors got pretty warm, truck got downright hot. If I were to design a closed non mechanical (read reliable) supplementary cooling system for the DD's, would anyone be interested? I have a background in physics, and fabrication, I could do it right.

Good perspective, 

Please do not wait to queue unsatisfied customers to initiate new/updated design.

Enertion's were going this direction, and now they have to [close](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/raptor-2-1-feedback/81607/241) discussion here as customer voices are stronger than their aptitude to fix issues (technical, manufacturing, CRM, B2C, etc...).

Anyways. Old TBDD axle on the left, new one on the right. The whole setup is even wider now - 35.3cm vs 36cm.
![20190512_020516|374x500](upload://A4swByNOtwcJKFur5icRvr2hGBA.jpeg) 

@torqueboards one of the axles is still too big to fit standard bearings. All of them are a tiny bit different so tolerances can still be improved further.

Its a motorized vehicle without approval here. You are only allowed to esk8 on private property. Only approved scooters up to 25kmh, no hoverboards, no esk8. The cops sometimes don't know what to do so anything is possible. Nothing at all, 600chf on the street, 150chf on the sidewalk, confiscation of the board, all of it happened so far.

But a dealer in my neighborhood does test runs every saturday... on a public road. :innocent:

I always ride on the coastal cycle path, never on the road. Police have seen me, but they were on foot. They'd need call for back up and block me off at the next entry point to the coast route. I honestly don't see them bothering unless someone reported me for dangerous riding - which I don't do. It's a grey area here in UK, but so long as you don't draw attention to yourself you are generally OK. Same for most things in life ;-)

"Motorized" implies it had motors added later, and not at the time of manufacture.

Most of our esk8 were manufactured with the motors.

I did not hit full throttle once... yeah I'm a pussy. 8:30 to 8:50 and 10:00 to 10:15 is really steep and the TBDD does accelerate with ease up these inclines with 220lbs/100kg on board. DD in combination with the 110mm TB wheels - the board is so quiet. 7km - 20% usage.

@torqueboards or anyone with some insight. Been riding for about a month on the 90KV DD‚Äôs. Apx 4 miles/ day. Today one (maybe both still feeling it out) started to whine (high pitches squeal) like something is not lubed up properly or maybe a bad bearing. Doesn‚Äôt sound good I can say that. Motors are a little hot but without temp sensors I can‚Äôt be sure how hot. I can even get it to whine with just a flick of the wheel by hand. Maybe after they cool down a bit it‚Äôll improve, but it‚Äôs a little worrying since they were so expensive. Wish I could upload a video. :/

I haven't tried, but the truck seems wide enough... If people have done it with TB218 I think you can do it with the DD trucks.

PROBLEM WITH 3 OUT OF 4 OF MY DD torque board motors..
only one out of 4 motors is OK..
the 3 others make a weird sound ,so I can't ride my board
I've been installing them with a focbox unity
I switched the connectors on the focbox unity, but the same motors have the same problems 
I switched the cables ,but nothing changed,I reinstalled the unity firmware several times,I changed the trucks , :always the same problem..
I don't know what to do to fix that
if someone had the same issue with the DDTB,thank you for telling me

Btw. I am still in love with my TBDDs. 75kv on 12s4p. I run them 80 motor amps, 60 battery amps and they are just on the brink of demanding too much of me = absolutely perfect :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: the TB110 aswell - despite being ridden for about 200km they look like new.

I am eagerly waiting for the second batch of the DD (and TB110). If tolerances have improved a tiny bit I will order a second set just for the sake of it.

@torqueboards any more thoughts on adjustable baseplates of some kind? 

I would love to pony up for that instead of having to go full custom on that shit.

Or a 10 degree baseplate and a 15 degree baseplate... in essence making a 45/50 split on a 35degree mountain board (aka kaly) or a 40/45 split on a Lacroix.

Could enable some sweet ass hybrid builds for the daring.

I still wonder if the torque will be high enough pneumatics even with 4x4 on all terrain tires. Even at the lower 75kv.

I have a 4WD 90kv set with 110s I decided not to use. So if anyone wanna buy them off me. Lmk. Price negotiable. Spent a total of $1200 on them. Or alternatively you can find someone who want to split them and buy two front trucks from TB for $180.

selling this at $1000 with the 110 now. so someone please take them off my hands.

@Richcan Depends on what you get for a battery pack ultimately. Our AT Tires should be available hopefully in about a month. They are currently in production now as far as when they will be ready for DD. We're trying to get them out ASAP :smile: Shouldn't be too long though.

I‚Äôll probably be getting the 12S4P for the 90KV I ordered. Enclosure should fit the Focbox unit? Just saving up for battery then that should be the last thing to complete the board. Then just the extras LED lights. Have a 5/8 dropped deck so will have to see if I‚Äôll do the drop through trucks and see how low the battery will be? Where would you buy the top truck plates if I decide to mount trucks on the bottom of the board? Also if doing a drop through there is bottom side truck plates for under the board?

This wait is so tough. I hope shipping starts soon too. 

I heard that it's great to focus on only one desire as the best way to stay happy. That way you are not inundating yourself with too many desires- focus on one desire and you will be happier in general. This has been my singular focus for a while now, and thankfully I haven't had to worry about wanting much else in life at this point, and so far i've been happy waiting for this one thing. 

I am guessing Dexter and his team are chipping away at the good work and we will all be satisfied with drives in hand soon :slight_smile:

@Richcan - Enclosure would fit focbox unity. You should have clearance. We have people using dropthrough decks or large foot pocket decks with our 12s4p. As of now, we don't have any deck protection parts for a drop through or X mount. Maybe in the near future.

@rideTastic - They come with all bearings. If you order wheels.

@DJase - Yeah, just finished up the adj baseplate drawing so working on testing.

@LEE - Temperature sensor should be working now.

@yelnats8j - Have not considered white :). Next color will most likely be Blue than maybe a Red option.

@rideTastic - Yeah, we should get some of the pending orders out on Monday with the others following shortly after.

Thing is I am so used to calibrate the remote... I calibrate them all the time no matter if it is a nano or not :sweat_smile:

The maytech v2 was ok. Liked everything about it but the tention of the knob. Specially at braking it just wasn't smooth enough for me.

Hoyt feels great in my big hands. Only thing I wish they could improve is a little bit of play in the center position but thats a minor detail.

@rideTastic I recommend the big evo 39‚Äú, the evo falcon I have is kind of short (after you know the hummiedeck everything feels short). with 97mm wheels and a singlestack enclosure you wont have a ton of clearance but certainly enough. I use a doublestack enclosure and have to use like 4cm of risers on 97mm wheels and still not enough clearance.

Looks sweet! My first board was the Meepo 1.5V and then picked up the Meepo V2 . I‚Äôve tried the newer version and from 1st to 3rd! Noticed a huge difference as I imagined how a board should feel. Now this is the moving onto the next version DIY and I can already imagine smoother ride! Smooth bearings! Smooth pickup/speed! Being able to role over the sidewalk cracks better! Option to change over to tires! More battery range in the build. Of course the Focbox for performance and being able to adjust acceleration/stopping/pickup etc...![image|375x500](upload://jHYYs4IwmHYuDKSDd7r5crAXU6p.jpeg)

Its another world on a smooth and powerful DIY board. I got an exway x1 and know how hubmotors feel - the DD is smooth af but the TB110 wheels are by far the most important for that fabulous ride.

With singlestack you will be fine with less risers I guess.

Will take a picture. The evo has some flex.

@Richcan 30lbs is a good ballpark estimate.

First post! 

Holy crap...just got a tracking # this evening for a Thursday delivery after 8pm. So stoked. Been patiently waiting since late December. Board is all ready to go....the drives and wheels were the last components I needed. 

I've currently got a dual 6374 12S4P setup with 97mm wheels. 

I'll make sure to take some pics and give a ride report (and the differences between setups) if no one minds this coming from a newbie whose first exposure to ES came in October 2018.

Full-blown summer arrived. We had 36C/97F today and the motors are getting hotter. Could still touch them but holding for longer was impossible today.

So if you are something like 100kg/220lbs watch out and don't stress them too much on inclines.

Got mine in today!!! Thanks Dexter/@torqueboards!! Seems no issues from first batch, both motors spin free and quiet, zealous bearings go on perfectly, fits genuine flywheels snug but not too tight, got a quick ride in before laying down (I have to redo my ppm mapping because full brake is neutral/50% on throttle, coast is 75% and full acceleration is 100% gah!) and these drives are powerful! I only got to ride with 33v battery so far, so it's charging up tonight for a good ride tomorrow. 

I've set them to 80/-80 motor each and 65/-12 battery each. I can't wait to put these through their paces tomorrow, Friday and the rest of this weekend. 

I've got the 90kv versions on 10S5P, 35¬∞ rear and 50¬∞ front and they are still super maneuverable and agile! I think I'm liking the stock bushings, but may change out the rear boardside for a firmer WFB chubby for some extra stability and to offset the extra leverage from the 35¬∞ baseplate. 

Glad I managed to fit it all in: ![20190626_212910|243x500](upload://vZv8FNLxf60WI6511cEx04c1mQn.jpeg) ![20190626_215409|243x500](upload://hEdh0gq2Lkhk3Ckk6JvsiNop2oC.jpeg)

How hot is too hot for these motors? I did some hard charging around, pulling ~55 battery amps/80 motor amps per motor for a while, then charged up a steep hill, then another. 

by the time I checked at the top of the hill, they were around 87C... my motor temp cutoffs are set to default at 85C start and 100C end. Is this appropriate to keep these safe? I'd lower it if it meant significant longevity gains.

Besides temps... I hit 117A easy on the first flat ground full throttle acceleration I tried it on before my bluetooth cut out (BT TAKING A CRAP LATELY). Its *CRAZY* feeling that much power!!!  I think I am going to up my battery max to 80A per motor for 160A total and see if that makes any difference. :eggplant::eggplant::call_me_hand::+1::+1::nose::alien::nerd_face::sunglasses::cowboy_hat_face:

10S5P, vtc5A. Lygte-info rated them at 35A, and they were on sale (still maybe?) on NKON for like $2.50 a cell. I am used to a 10S4P 25r, the total mAh is higher per cell on the vtc's + 1P so it's more range than I'm used to, not to mention the amp output a second time...

I wish I could pull logs, it's all spotty since my BT only stays connected for a couple seconds. I'll have to look, I didn't see any option for brake and accel temp cutoffs, just motor temp cutoff in general. That's a good idea though... Worst case I slide quite a bit, but that won't help if I'm slowing to a stop 3 ft from a main road entrance.

Just wanted to leave this here for anyone else to use.  I wont get a chance to try this "fix" until this weekend, if I even choose too.

## KEGEL/ABEC ADAPTERS Bearing Seat Too Tight

The bearing seat on the kegel/abec adapter can be a bit too tight. If it is too tight it‚Äôs about .20mm - .40mm too tight. This can restrict the free spin of the motor.

To fix it, you can space out the gap between the direct drive motor and the wheel adapter.

1. The fix for this is to remove the wheel. It‚Äôs a tight fit and may require you to use a soft mallet to remove the wheel. You can hit the wheel from the inside of the wheel towards the outer side of the axle.
2. Undo the 6 bolts that hold the kegel/abec adapter together. We use a T20 Star/Torx Bit as this will prevent any stripping of threads.
3. Add 2 layers of masking tape on 3 sections of the Direct Drive Motor. We add them in-between the bolt holes on top of the cavity hole for the wheel adapter. This will sit the wheel adapters a bit higher once the wheel adapter is tightened.
4. Spin the direct drive motor and notice the amount of free spin.
5. Re-assemble the wheel adapter and secure the 6x M4 Star Bolts to secure the wheel adapter.
6. Spin the direct drive motor again after securing the wheel adapter and the free spin should be very similar. It is typically easier to free spin once you attach the wheel to the setup.
7. Once completed, you should be perfectly fine. Re-assemble the wheel onto the direct drive and secure your lock nut.
8. When securing the lock nut. The wheel will tighten on the adapter a bit more this is designed and meant to do this.
9. Confirm the lock nut is secure and is not applying too much force on the bearing but yet tight enough that there is no horizontal play on the axle.

Just gave this a go even though my drives are spinning fine.  Added two layers of electrical tape between the adapter and motor.  Might be a placebo effect but I swear it spins ever slightly more free by hand now. :thinking:

This was great information. Thanks for posting. I did as you instructed (used two layers of electrical tape - slight substitution) and both motors spin much better now. One motor in particular was pretty stiff. 

Just before this fix, I performed a motor config.

Would ya'll recommend performing another motor config or does it matter?

Managed to get my direct drives working with their "masking tape" fix.  Unfortunately, they will not be providing replacement wheel adapters to fix the issue and only offering a $20 discount to get a new one (which will also not be in spec?). 

They are amazing and ride like a dream but I would wait a couple of months for them to get the kinks out before purchase though.

How noticeable is the "bearing seat too tight" issue?  My motors seem to spin freely and they are each spinning the same.  I assume I don't have this issue as all I hear is a little motor noise when I spin them.  When I'm freewheeling while riding they are scary quiet.  I'm gonna need a bell or something since these drives are so quiet.

Don't worry about some strange sounds while handspinning the drives. My first batch drives sound a little different all the time. The C clip position changes sound, temperatures etc. 

Thats what they sounded like brandnew and I thought the left motor is broken or something... nada, running perfect ever since and both sound almost the same now when they are cold after a few hundred kilometers.

Further you see the freespin of my 1st batch motors brandnew. Play with the tension of the wheelnut. Get them as loose as possible without the motors starting to be movable on the hanger.

That not entirely accurate. Both hand spinning and regular motoring I would get a horrible whining noise come from one of my motors after about 100 miles and loosening didn‚Äôt help, but some ‚Äúdry‚Äùlubricant did. I‚Äôm still a little suspicious of the bearings in that one motor, but I have been commuting for about a week and have not had it happen again and haven‚Äôt had any over heating issues.

Motors should all roll smooth. Typical issues if they aren't rolling smooth would be the following:

* Axle nut restricted/too tight.
* Circlip restricted/too tight.
* Wheel adapter restricted/too tight.
* Bearing restricted/too tight.

If they don't roll smooth, check the possible issues above. If any issues, send us an email. :smile:

I wish I hadn‚Äôt deleted the video I sent over to Dexter so you can verify you‚Äôre experiencing the same thing, but basically it sounded like a bearing that wasn‚Äôt spinning, or something was rubbing against one of the spinning parts or some such thing. The problem only started about 100 miles (one month) into riding the board. The motors were otherwise both spinning just fine, no problem there just the constant wahhhhhhhhhh, wahhhhhhhhh in one motor. 

I had taken the wheels off and replaced them. Checked the clip as instructed and did a general inspection. Nothing changed to that point. But to me it sounded distinctly like a bearing issue or plastic rubbing on metal or something generally rubbing at high speed. 

It was too familiar of a rubbing noise and so I asked Dexter if it was possible to try a little lube. He said sure. I dug out my bottle Riptide Speed Lube ‚Äúdry formula‚Äù. Tipped the motor to one side (inner facing up) and put a few drops (5-6 drops maybe; not much) in and around the entire rubber seal right below the clip that holds the motor together. I didn‚Äôt remove the cover or open anything, just let it soak in around the ‚Äúdust cover‚Äù. Worked the motor around a little by hand, let it rest for a few hours and applied another 6 drops or so and let it rest overnight. The squeal was diminished within minutes and once the oil penetrated it seems to be set for good. I attached a pic of the motor part Im talking about even though I‚Äôm sure you will know. I just want to be as clear as possible because these are expensive motors. I don‚Äôt want to be the cause for someone ruining their investment. 

Maybe @torqueboards can clarify that this is all kosher, but it seems to have worked and my motors appear no worse for wear.  Although I‚Äôm still a little suspicious, so much so that I ordered a 2nd set of DD‚Äôs to compare and to have in case this first set needs to be returned. Many here have mentioned how quiet the motors are and mine have never really been super quiet, at least not like those stupid skooters around town. Those things are dead quiet and maybe the DD‚Äôs aren‚Äôt meant to be, but I haven‚Äôt received the second set yet to compare. The pair I have now sound a little more like ‚Äúdrills‚Äù (that‚Äôs not exactly right, but kind of close). I like the sound in fact, but they aren‚Äôt dead quiet. 

What @McErono showed in the video above is quite normal. What I experienced was a high pitched squeal that was far, far worse than ‚Äúnot what I expected‚Äù and clearly sounded like something was wrong. As I said I had been riding the board for weeks before the squeal started.

That sound is no longer there since I added the lubricant. I can at least say that. 

I would see if Dexter says a-ok because I don‚Äôt want to give someone bad advice, but this is what has worked for me so far. 

I hope it gives you something to work with because I know how frustrating it is relying on ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù. I think TB‚Äôs staff is probably overwhelmed with lots of stupid questions and our constant enquiries for ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs my shit‚Äù? making it hard to separate and respond to genuine issues. 

If I can be any further help don‚Äôt hesitate to ask.

My clips are both offset like that and my motors run smooth. Do the motors spin free off the axles? Maybe move the outer speed ring to the inside? I use zealous bearing with integrated spacers and speed rings on both sides and it works perfectly for me. Good luck üëç

That‚Äôs exactly the right question, I should have mentioned that I originally forgot to order a 2nd sensor wire. The woes of a newb. 

I‚Äôve been running BLDC ever since because I‚Äôve been really busy and I really wanted to enjoy my setup. I have the wire now and I assume it will probably change the experience quite a bit once I wrap up my weekend job and have a chance to setup the board FOC. 

But hey. No problems here guys. I was just passing along my experience to @Bundymus. Thanks for the advice though. 

Also anyone can PM me any time if they have questions also. I‚Äôm not a whiz, but I‚Äôve learned a thing or two since the start. I‚Äôm hoping to put  a few vids together for others like myself who are extremely new to all of this. I have to finish my weekend work first though. :frowning: 

I‚Äôm hoping to post some photos of the 2nd build as well. The pics for my current board are somewhere above if you can find the moonshine Hooch. 

However, I want try those TB‚Äôs pneumatics. :grimacing: and needed a different deck for that so I went for an EVO (I wonder, when those wheels are going to land?) I also wanted to try a smaller battery for a lighter, short range board, but Dexter has pretty much talked me out of that. 

If anyone has experience with smaller packs and these drives and wants to share their experience that would be appreciated. I‚Äôm currently using a 12S4P pack, but it sounds like smaller packs are a bad match for DD‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt intend on getting the 2nd set of DD‚Äôs so soon, but here I am and it seems to be shifting the buildout a little. I love these motors so much and my daily commute is actually awesome now. Life is so hard. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Took my temporary build to a hill yesterday and this thing performs like a beast. Tried it a very steep hill (~40 degrees or so) and my board zipped up no problem.

Currently using 10s lipo with a unity and it is scary fast for a relatively new eskater like me (my previous build was a single 6374 on Chinese esc for comparison). Still need to learn how to tame this beast but I can already tell that I will have plenty of fun with it :smiley: 

Quick acceleration test of just the board:

Hearing how you explains how well your drives perform I am nothing short of positive that my drives were fucked and not right from the start. Whatta you think @Arzamenable cause this is not the experience i've gotten to have even once yet on either set of motors ive received. Really sucks cause I want to love them. (I still think you should grab those eggs you bought and forgot yesterday so we can cook some scrambled deliciousness on my cans.) 

How hot are everyone elses motors getting? With conservative settings, riding no hills and at about 60-70% of how I normally ride for less than 5 miles my cans were 135 c yesterday. No one is touching those things for more than a few miliseconds. Even 15-20 minutes later and wiping them down some with a cold rag didn't even change or help anything...

This can't be normal to run this hot. Oh and I got a DRV fault code as well since they seem to want to cut out / cog (haven't been able to diagnose the exact issue yet but it almost kills me around 6 times every time I try to go for a ride. Switched unity x 2 focboxes, changed batteries, remotes, PPM x CAN bus, loopkey x power switch, decks, and it happens on every combination, has to be the motors right?

Anyone else have similar issues on the DD's?

135C is super hot. 

My 90KV, at 80A battery amps per motor, 80motor amps, don't get that hot. 

For comparison, if it's 95¬∞F outside, super humid, I can ride around gently for a few miles, pushing hard here and there for a bit, then charge up a steep road for about a block, then another small hill at full throttle. I get thermal throttling about 2/3 the way up the hills since I set my motor temp cutoff to 85¬∞C, and by the top my motors sit at 87.5¬∞C.

Both cans are getting that hot? Strange to think that both motors have the same issue if that's the case...

Vesc tool can measure winding resistance... Right? This might be useful to see if your resistance is abnormally high... But I don't know what standard resistance for these motors should be. I'll have to check next time is disassemble my board.

I ordered Unity. I sent a pic of an app there working on and some of it is up and running. I think had motor temp etc.. I‚Äôve never set up a board yet but would be good to snap pic of settings making sure all input in put in correctly. Type of battery, wheel size if it does all of that. I always thought Direct Drive would run cooler not being a hub driven motor being inside of PU. They would have no problem with heat issues? Good luck! Mine are out for delivery!

[/quote]

somehow the heat has to get out from the stator windings in the center of the motor where probably 95% of the heat is produced.  you can have the rotor uncovered such as with a direct drive instead of hub motor, but the heat still has to get from the stator either to the skate hanger aluminum or to the magnets and then out through the outside of the rotor.  there's ferrofluid which is a magnetic liquid which can fill the gap and allow conduction otherwise youre pretty much limited to convection heat transfer to the magnets and its rotor.   Its the same obstacle bike hub motors have and they use ferrofluid (magnetic fluid to fill the airgap) with heatsinks mounted on the outside of the motor

whats the actual phase resistance and kv as seen on the vesc tool?

Ok so small mistake, I didn't know that yesterday @Arzamenable had the temp sensor thing on f and thought it was still on c, see pic(s). 

*** Disclaimer - sorry in advance... I know this is a lot of vowels and syllables, but if you've had any issues with your TB DD's please just skim through real quick cause I haven't come across anyone with similar, issues, can;t figure out the cause of my, (unless I've just been lucky enough to get 2 bad sets of motors in a row with these things.....) 

However, doesn't really matter because I also included a screenshot from last week/end on the 1st or 2nd day I got my replacement motors (due to the first ones blowing 4  of my focboxes on me for whatever reason and I had to take the hit 100%, which if my fault I have no issue with which is what I figured on the first and maaaaaaybe another but after #2 happened the following day knowing I had all my VESC tool settings correct, and even after having pyscho and 3 other building buddies take a look no one could figure out why after passing motor detection (FOC sensored, R2 extra bat 10s4p 30q) detection just fine on the first test run within the first 5-10 mins not even going above 65% throttle and driving rather mellow since it's the first test run on a new build, BOOM, I'd lose all/most of my torque and power randomly only to realize when I got off right away and looked that one motor wasn't spinning anymore, so pedaled my ass back home to find out one focbox got toasted for some reason. The same motor all 4x's this happened it was always on the first time I'd take the board out to try after setting it up. still, don't know what was happening on the first set. But I digress) so back qst ones, I feel and am pretty confident these have major issues too.... first they won't pass detection running it with 2 focboxes, have to fuck with the parameters like the help says (using ack 3.1 or 3.2 FYI ow keys won't make the motor spin. Got weird values sometimes. So after 2 days of looking for similar issues on here, having 2 building buddies check it out that have more time doing DIY than me, finally got first motor to pass but had to bump up the current parameters) and it would cog crazzzzzy loud and bad not spinnin but I gave it a little nudge it would start to spin up out of the cog. but not until I went from 5.0 to 19.0 (WTF!!!!) on the current (i) for one more and it would spin up on it's own and pass, then the 2nd motor same thing but to 13.0 instead of 19. Then hall sensors wouldn't pass detection the first dozen attempts. Restarted, changed, cord, checked wiring, etc and all was fine, ended up having to bump the current up there too but not as drastic and only 1-3 total on each side. Excitedly finish the set up and go out for a test run.... take 1-3 hard pedals and give it some throttle and it cogs trying to get going even when rolling, was just going to chalk it up to direct drives and not worry about it cause as I start going they felt awesome, fast/strong/powerful/quiet sound etc. So go for a cruise just around my neighborhood and am stoked but then after just like 5-10 mins of cruisin around 60% of how I normally ride not only does it cog sometimes off the start with or w/out pedaling, but it will also randomly cog  (i think that's what it's doing and sounds like) mid acceleration or when gaining speed to where if I not 100% paying attention and/or waiting for a stutter/jolt/stall to happen I would definitely be eating asphalt. Almost have multiple times cause of these things and have to run it out constantly. It almost feels like a remote cut out or a motor short / phase wire touching briefly cause it's always just a really quick and surprising, but it sounds like a cog and it's definitely something coming from the motor. And it's so random when it happens but I have concluded it is only under load never on the bench, and only when I am accelerating, doesn't matter hard or super slow like LHB (J/k) it will glitch out. Never any fault codes, until yesterday the unity popped one after it happened a few times on a ride but the dam app froze before I could screen shot or not have it disconnect before getting back. Wasn't anything specific like I've seen or had before though,it  just showed DRV_FAULT_CODE that it with some figures or settings underneath, the weirdest part is the unity still works fine, far as I can tell so far......

(Sorry again this is long my dudes, I just want to make sure I include everything that I've experienced on these things the last couple of weeks to hopefully get it figured out and not have to send them back again since I haven't even gone on 4one real ride yet since I got them on the first batch.

So this last part is the weirdest IMO (and most annoying and frustrating by far) and after riding around for a little (not hard or charging crazy hills) it will be running perfectly the first mile or two or so and I'll be happy, then I will either stop or let off the throttle for whatever reason and then when I go to accelerate again I have roughly 5-10% of the power I just had and can't go above like 10 mph whereas 10 mins ago I was cruising around on flat at 31mph not even full throttle.... I try turning it all off and on, nope, so pedal for a couple hundred yards trying the throttle off and on and after 5-15 minutes as long as I am one either completely flat not even 1% incline, or downhill, they will start to get some of the normal power back, otherwise I can floor the throttle all the way down and instead of getting thrown off like what would and should happen my 93 y/o Hungarian grandma could walk at a faster pace with ease. 

*** I have videos of me showing these phenomena above if anyone wants it or thinks it will help diagnose this shit. Also have a couple others like showing the motors power and sound both before, during, and after the run,screenshots of xmatic or the ride app so that you can see I'm not even going 5 miles with minimal elevation change before these things start happening every attempt I try to go for a ride, and also some videos of the heat sensor gun shit yesterday.

Couple extra quick notes...
- This all happens whether I have the thermal throttling toggled on or off  (when using unity at least) cause that's what I thought it was
- Tried different remotes, batteries, power button / loopkey, resoldered bullet (different sizes even), put what my normal settings would be, put VERY conservative setting, night / day time, fast/slow mode, different decks, 2 focboxes as well as a unity, canbus and spit PPM (with the FB's obvi), and I'm sure I'm forgetting some other things 1that have been tried too... 
    - I have also tried all the little tricks everyone on this thread has mentioned. I did have to sand down the axle to get bearings to seat properly but no big deal, though maybe it was getting stuck or the motor clip thing (c-clip?) but no issues there. No resistance on my motors has great freeroll per usual.

I'm honestly just about completely fed up and over these things at this point though and leaning towards just returning them and having Dex refund me as I try to accept that God doesn't want me to get to enjoy and feel safe on these motors. I REALLY fucking want to just mob them with no issues though...But I'm beyond stumped. Hope someone is bored enough to read this novel (sorry again) and has some insight or similar issues...... Thanks in advance fellas. $100 reward from Dexter to anyone who can figure it out so we both don't have to send shit back and forth again.... and so I don't have to wait another month or two before I get to enjoy the drives I bought last November :dizzy_face::gun:

Open to any and all suggestions and can get whatever other info or settings someone wants in addition to the above and I can try anything anyone feels could help. Thanks! 

@McErono _ Don't ask me why but I have a random feeling that you are going ti have the right solution for me... just strong vibes making that pop ion my head for some reason. HAHAH, no joke. you do ride similar and watch your build on here, job well done.

Good idea, unfortunately, I think my settings are all good and the few peeps I've shown them too were actually really surprised at where I had them and how they are acting so don't think that's it. I really do hope it is something dumb that I didn't catch and got past the few other DIY homies that have tried to figure it out. Thanks for the idea, I have been using @sofu  app since last week, seems to have some connection issues with Bluetooth for some reason, anyone else reporting this @sofu. I think I might have figured out it's when I have, or it's trying to connect to the x-matic app if I have that open too... is that possible or can the unity Bluetooth be connected to different Bluetooth apps simultaneously? plus I'm not always using a unity, maybe once my 2 more arrive any year now, but until then only one that's actually being sent back to enertion tomorrow and my 3 other builds are dual FB. Thankfully @Arzamenable was nice enough to lend me one of his metr pro modules last night that I'm about to solder up install to try out. 

Favor,..... Does Anyone have a quick link on the pinout or wiring instructions for a dual FB and/or Unity build? I'm a metr virgin and usually just use the HM-10 modules... Didn't see if when I skimmed through the OG page the had a thread for on it..... @rpasichnyk maybe?

You try manipulating the phase wires while running on the bench and do repeated foc test and look at the ohms?  I think the motor has to be shorting if it's destroying escs and acting like that

@Jansen but I do understand this is your second set of DDs right? No one else has the same issues so far - my guts telling me it is not an issue with the DDs. That behaviour of running fine and then after a short pause not having any power is in my opinion not motor related.

Your sensors are not working (running in sensorless mode?) and the temp sensor gives crazy values? (Screen shows 130 and 180C in the unity app) there are sensor-adapter cables with different pin allocations. My adapter cables from torqueboards were working fine, some others I had to swap pins to make em work. But usually they work or they don't work at all.

You are talking about a "horrible sound" while cogging. I had the exact same thing going at first with my DDs. First thing was I calibrated my remote in slow mode instead of fastest mode = cutouts. Second thing (horrible sounding cogging) was a firmware issue on the unity when I was accelerating fast from a standstill. Firmware 23.43 sorted that out completely. 

I am going over 30mph at the moment, pushing it hard on steepest uphills - no issues whatsoever. BUT I still avoid 35mph were some guys like murloc experienced issues (complete lockup of the motors - not DDs).

@rideTastic the unity setup via app in combination with the DDs doesn't get any easier. Its foolproof. The only time I used the unity tool (tcp bridge and usb-c) was to reduce the remote ppm deadzone. 30sec and you are good to go. And I did every firmware update via Bluetooth so far, one of them even on the road in the middle of a ride.

Thanks @Hummie & @McErono. Fucked with it for a while longer last night and might have gotten something figured out, just not sure what yet. Marc I had already tried and checked pretty much everything you mentioned that  I just read on your reply from past builds, randomly enough I actually had the same thought on the sensor wire adapter last night  before I read it from you maybe being messed up because of the FB pin out being missed labeled, I got them from Psycho but I swapped em to use different adapters I had handy, not sure where they‚Äôre from, and that very well may have fixed the issue. Went for a test ride last night and didn‚Äôt experience any of the cut outs or weird things for the first time, but didn‚Äôt push it too very hard and had settings pretty low because it was like 2am.  About take it out again shortly once the batteries fully charged any minute and will let you guys know, programming again as we speak to up the settings some closer to where I normally have them. Hoping there could be some good news Dex @torqueboards. I really hope so. I did try to run it sensorless both FOC and BLDC though and couldn‚Äôt get it to pass that way but hoping that was a fluke‚Ä¶it was before I switched FB‚Äôs and adapters. Thanks for the ideas fellas. (I am using two different font boxes then the first two I originally tested it with and ditched the unity too, Think that had something to do with it too? bad phase wire somewhere maybe‚Ä¶? Would that make sense @Hummie???

It's a long thread and I'm not sure what all ur prob were but to test the motor I'd move wires around a lot, pull on them, then do repeated foc testing and look at ohms. If it's not the phase wire connection it could be a short within the windings.  That more so gives cogging and bad power and extra heat continuously vs something loose 

  maybe move phase wires a lot while running on bench while adding a lot of resistance with a gloved hand maybe.  And do sensorless to narrow it down

Hi guys,

For any of you guys who want to see the sheer size of the beast, compared to the Raptor 2.1 drivetrain:
![IMG_20190715_194429|374x500](upload://7lyo23Crhp7v26ODelkdC9nvmsp.jpeg) 

I will go for a long (50km +/-) ride later today, will update on the 90kv performance (no metr module on the unity unfortunatly), but I believe Strava will do the job ;)

Nice cracking PU @ Enertion Hubs.

My man.... Completely the same reasons as well. Pu beat up as hell but after roughly 700 km, one motor was getting close to burst in flame (125C), super short axle prone to wobble...

I feel so confident now on the DD, I will try to clock a faster top speed than on the Raptor (57km/h), and I believe the wobble will be non-existent.

Furthermore, I manage to get max 35km of range on a 12s5p with the Raptor (75kg geard up, hills and flat, not so smooth road...), I think with the free rolling possibility of the DD, I could manage 45/50km easily on one charge. I will check the WH/km on the Unity from time to time and will update the numbers.

Back to give you more meat on the bone on these DD's.

We went yesterday for 60+KM ride with a friend of mine. Smooth path, few gravels path, up and downhill...

![strava3656529592121053189|500x500](upload://aeX6kKW9trBxLnvAW4Bp3V6YT5i.jpeg) 

The DD manage the length like champs, no overheat whatsoever (cans were hot, but could grab them for few seconds), the torque was super smooth, they don't want to stop accelerating (even when I reached 60km/h), the power consumption is ridiculous thanks to the free rolling!! (After 20km or so, we checked with my friend our Wh/km, he had 14.2Wh/km on his GTR Diy with pneumatics, I had 7.3 !!

Furthermore, the grip was magnificent... Which brings me to the TB 110mm big wheels....

I checked thoroughly after the ride for any bumps, cut, gravels stuck in the urethane.... They are still pristine, if I would washed them, they would be like new !

@AlanZhou After being a Raptor 2.1 driver for 6 months, and testing out the DD's yesterday, I can assure you the free rolling is higher on the DD

Guys who received them/will received them/ think about getting them : You are in for a treat !!

@torqueboards You promised something amazing, you delivered something astonishing ! Thank you (PS: Please let us know the ETA for the DD adapter for AT wheels)

Any advices are welcome :)

## \#1958 Posted by: torqueboards Posted at: 2019-07-19T14:15:20.107Z Reads: 163

@ThomasL - There are two options to increase brake strength.

1. Increase braking regen from -15 to -30 amps and that should give you more then enough brake. It was more then enough for me even going downhill but if you want even more 2nd option.
2. Use current mode and limit reverse speed and you can get stronger brakes as the motor will go in reverse instead of braking. You just have to be mindful of it. I haven't tried this one yet personally but I'd imagine it's similar to Boosted's setup which works nicely too.
```

Humm, strange, my braking regen is already around -35.
So by switching from Accelerate/brake to Accelerate/reverse it should become stronger ?


Will try later and post it up.

Yeah, what I think I do automatically that I haven't noticed is if I'm at low speed.. I'll throttle it and then brake. Seems to help with braking IMO on belt drive or DD.

If that doesn't work you'll probably have to try the 2nd option.

@rideTastic It's a really tight tolerance so it won't be 100% for each motor. Once you get the wheels on and the axle nut secure. Both motors will fit fine. The tightness doesn't affect performance in anyway. We may have forgot about the bolts and risers. You can email us and we can include it on your next order. Sorry for the inconvenience.

One of my motors felt the same, I luckily was able to just tighten down the axle nut and it doesn't move back and forth any more.
One of the motors has a little bit more resistance than the other and makes a trippy sound like something might be loose but not sure.
More evident when you run power thru it and it only does it at start up or in the first second or so of accelerating.

So then I don't have to worry about my loose motor.

Yes, that's not bad because I probably didn't have a warranty on unity anyway. I took it out of my raptor 2.1.

A guy from the skateshop said that the axles were not wide enough for +50kmh stability. lol he told me evolves are better.. Anyway the other guy from another skateshop has said he never saw a wide axles like this before :smiley:

You have a year warranty on your unity if you took it off of your raptor. Only like 30 or 60 days if you just buy a unity only from enertion. That's all without buying the extra warranty of course. You can always do what I (may) have done if you have issues and just buy and solder back on 3.5 mm bullets before you send it back it. Already had my R2 serviced a couple of times and did that. It obviously wasn't the cause to my issues and really not sure why they even have that policy still. Pretty lame.

I believe so Dex ya! Went on a couple longer rides this weekend to really test it out and all seemed well for the most part and I really couldn't tell you what it was causing it was doing weird stuff with the unity & 2 focboxes, but when I switched to another 2 focboxes I had it's been pretty good ever since. The weird thing is I use those other 2 FB's and the unity on other builds I ride regularly and those work fine. Fuckin trip. I do have one question though still.... I know these things aren't made for hills (no esk8 really is) and it's not like I am just trying to mob crazy hill after crazy hill or anything.... but I do live in Anaheim Hills and my neighborhood is actually up some hills. So when I ride daily down to the store to grab whatever I need (3.1 miles round trip if I just go there and back) omw back up I will be going close to full speed from the flat at the bottom and every other time or so I lose most power by the time I get to the top where my pad is, to where I will go to give it throttle once I get to the top and barely moves, is that heat thing or what? Cause once I get back to flat or let it chill for 5-10 mins it will go back to normal....what bugs me about it more than anything though is my R2 charges hard no problem up it (not from a stop mid hill of course) and my A/T set up with TB 6355's (that are over 2 years old still going strong it amazes me) makes it up no problem either.... lmk what you think. I just can't avoid the hill going home and it is actually the lesser hill of the 2 ways to go back home. Overall stoked on them though and love the speed, power, sound, free roll is awesome and I already get better range just from that. Thanks homie @torqueboards

Just got mine today, very nice indeed, really feels like quality everything, very robust..
Anyway mine arrived with 75kv, ordered 90s, wondering if anyone in the eu got a 90kv by mistake, could probably swap?

@Jansen they shouldn't be doing that unless they are overheating and/or unless your not giving it throttle throughout the hill. Are you using sensors? If so check what your motor heat cutoff is. If you have a metr.at try that to get more data.

We have people who do climbs hills and I haven't heard of any issues so far.

When you spin your setup does it spin freely when on the bench?

@Tangent I believe you emailed us? I haven't checked yet. I'll get back to you soon.

Just had my first test drive. 

*Landy Evo 12S4P 75kV * 

I only used HUB boards before (Meepo v2 & Raptor 2.1). 
What should I say after 15min? It's so awesome.

Finally I can take tight curves again and carve nicely. When I switched from Meepo v2 to my Raptor I was a bit disappointed. The acceleration was awesome but otherwise it was like a downgrade. Tight corners and carving were not as nice as with the Meepo. But the current setup combines the best of both boards and also uses real longboard wheels. I even think that the TBDD rolls longer and the resistance after releasing the throttle is less than with the raptor.

**But i have two problems.** My motor is still moving on the axle even though I screwed the tires on and the Abec Cores have some play and "wobble" inside.

![Capture|690x237](upload://eWFMJSUwznmnvttnOjW8pOOk4f6.jpeg) 

So I put another 80km on them on one trip, with hill climbing and downhill.
Might repeat myself here, but they are incredible !

My friend (110 kilos) tested them, and even he was impressed with the torque (90kv) and took them to around 52km/h, with no sign of stopping.

Thanks to the free rolling and amazing efficiency, I managed to do 45 km on my 12S5P (92%), with a 7 km racing against bikes, blasting at 50/55 km/h on a flat with few hills (the mofos won at the end), and going back home with 18% battery remaining after a 3 km long hill.

In comparison, the friend who was riding with me had pretty much the same battery percentage left, but his DIY is a 12s8p Sanyo monster.

And again, the TB 110 Big wheels managed the road like champs, no cut/chunking.

I will update you guys after 500km on them, motors performance and wheels.

Cheers,

@rideTastic - The right side being loose along the axle shouldn't be happening. I'd confirm and see what the issue is. I would not ride it at this time.

As far as the abec adapters they are slightly a bit loose. You'll want to add some heatshrink so things are a bit tighter fit.

As for the motor issue, I'll look into it. If you can send an email to support. This way we can log these issues and make improvements if we can. Are your motors still rideable?

I would love an answer to this question of noise. That‚Äôs exactly what I experienced and you can read above about how I went about ‚Äúfixing‚Äù the problem. 

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a permanent fix or not. I have to do some work on my board this week for final verification, but the short of it is I used a little speed line and cleared it right up. Would like to hear @torqueboards opinion on this so I can decide whether to send my motor in for a quick look (‚Äúrepair‚Äù) or if the fix could be permanent. Motor bearings sound a little ‚Äúdry‚Äù now, but that may also be because they‚Äôre starting to break in. (?) 

I don‚Äôt know yet but as I get more info I‚Äôll post an update.

Just take off the wheels and pull the motors. You don‚Äôt have to remove the motors though. I just turned my board on the side to expose the ‚Äúinner dust ring‚Äù and retainer clip and put a few drops around that ring and let it soak in. You‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs not an airtight seal and there‚Äôs enough of a seam to apply literally just 6 or so drops, soak  and maybe reapply. I only had the issue with one motor though. You too? 

I can‚Äôt say I would recommend WD40 because it tends to act more like a solvent and would destroy any grease in and around the bearings that was installed at the factory. Any decent lubricant should be fine, I prefer ‚Äúdry‚Äù lubricant because it makes less mess. They sell similar stuff at bike shops also, but I specifically used ‚Äúriptide speed lube‚Äù.  Pic repost for reference. 

![image|375x500](upload://fFDZpYG0qqgpdavDvY9JaTr40cM.jpeg) 



Let‚Äôs see what Dexter says but initially he said go ahead and give it a shot. I have t done enough riding yet to say this is a permanent fix or not. But I have put about 50 miles on it since I did this and seems to be fine. Certainly the sound went away immediately. Literally within 5 mins of the first application.

Could be a dried out bearings. Sounds almost like it. Not really sure otherwise why the motor would sound like that.

I typically re-oil my standard outrunner boards usually every 2-4 weeks when I use them frequently and everything just runs a lot more smoother. At least for me the dirt and grime would just cake on after time.

@rideTastic use bearing oil. Don't use WD40. I would think WD40 might dry it out more.

Try it and let us know. We'll have to double check all bearings and make sure they are lubed up.

Hey @torqueboards  I opened a case with support #13435 regarding my TBDD order #18757.  One of my motors is making a unusual sound and motor specs when doing motor detection look a little low for both motors.  Max amps ~26A.  I uploaded a pic of the detection page and  a vid of the motor turning that shows the noise.

both not normal. all should be tight. 

these motors seem perfectly fit to the tb110 kegels in terms of adapter tightness and axle lenght. if you can move that motor this much sideways the thread on the axle is way too short for these lazyrolling wheels.

as soon as my motors have a little bit of play on the hanger (by loosening the axlenut too much) they make a horrible grinding sound (vibrations) but that goes away as soon as I tighten the nut again.

did you try to put some electrical tape on top of the motors/under the adapters? try adding 2-3 speedrings on the outside of the wheels to get a tight fit and compare the sound.

my first gen TBDD still have no issues at all other than some rare random noises and clicking that comes and goes with temp changes.

btw. the big bearing at the back is filled with grease, so oiling (get yourself some bones speedcream or something) is not that effective. just remove the bearing seal carefully with a razor blade and make sure its not dry.

@rideTastic - Sounds a lot better but there is still a sound. Let me know if anything else comes up. I'm checking on it too and will report back if I find anything.

@JeffDJ I should get to tickets soon. From your video I'd double check and make sure the axle nut is completely tight.

You should see if you can isolate that sound. Most times it will be the bearing or the cir-clip.

@McErono Yeah, will have an enclosure with a rubber seal. But it's a large cavity, 1 big cavity. Actually trying to make it 650x168x15. 17 layers, 2ply carbon fiber.

@torqueboards
Hi guys ! 
I receive my DD and god they are just incredible 
You did an amazing job guys !
Only one thing is bothering me 
-one wheel is harder to spin than the other , not all around but like 1/3 of one turn is really harder 
I tried to loose the wheel a little bit and it a bit better but still a restriction ...
Any suggestions? 
Thanks :) !

Ok Dex @torqueboards I really hope you make me look dumb right now otherwise I really over these things. They feel so strong, fast, sound good, then just when I think I‚Äôve finally figured out whatever issue I‚Äôm having I am walking up another f*#^%¬•#g hill. So over that shit. I‚Äôve included my metr from just right now, started full battery, just went down the street and back and 3/4 of the way up no power. Or the least prolly possible. The last couple minutes I was flooring it and going like 5 mph. When I get to fiat it starts to pick up again but not for like 10-15 then it will be normal again. Until I reach another incline..... please tell me I‚Äôm retarded somewhere...... I‚Äôve literally tried EVERYTHING and had multiple people building much longer than me and all 3-4 of them say my settings are right and can‚Äôt figure out why it‚Äôs doing this. No faults either. ![image|281x500](upload://vwA29MkI0Y7iVWg5jsxwc33uV5D.jpeg) ![image|281x500](upload://oYY93AgLlyO1scagqfbzAgdzx74.jpeg)

You are reaching the motor temperature limit, so the VESC cuts power to the motors, once they cool down a bit you get the power back

Really? @Pedrodemio So with brand new motors I can't even go on a 20 minute ride less than 3 miles to the store and back..... doesn't seem like this should happen, but it does every time i ride though even if not on any hills.  i think 1/15 times ive tried to go for a ride this happens. I havent even gotten to ride like I normally do, maybe 75% cause Im too afraid cause they always cut out or lose power like this..... that can't be normal right? Been trying everything for a month or two and still can't get it to stop, even on only flat ground when I was in SD last weekend it happened. I smell something too that is almost like burning grease or something by the motors. My Raptor hub can handle the areas ive been trying to go just fine but these can't..... seems not right to me but lmk if im wrong....

If u can do a foc test and see the inductance and resistance numbers it'll tell if the motor is ok.  I imagine the two motors should be relatively close resistance.  What is the resistance?

If the magnets are rubbing I can't imagine a solution but if mechanically the motor were fine u can check it electrically doing the bldc or foc test on the Vesc connected to a computer.  With the new vescs maybe it's not the same but id think ud still be able to get these numbers.  The phase resistance will be so low it's not gunna show accurately on a multimeter.  U could use an inductance meter if the rotor were off and either number can show how the winds are doing.  Easiest on vesc


People w tight motors it could be axial compression on either side and u could grind down the big c clip. Maybe.

I received my 75kv set with 110 Kegels on Wednesday! So far so good, they look impressive. However, they seem to have a similar issue as described here by @AlanZhou, @epss4, and @ridetastic. One of the motors is not spinning freely for about 1/3rd of the rotation. I haven't used them yet, that's what I noticed straight out of the box. Tried adjusting the lock nut tension but no change.

Axle should have end play tolerance + -
Maybe magnets from glueing are not honed/centre to shell. The only way it to take apart and run a dial indicator to shell OD and Shell/Magnet ID also a test on the axle.

@Jansen what was your ambient temp? You are doing quite some uphills there more than 100m in altitude. These things get hot! Just up your temp limit a bit (start 100c, cutoff 120c). I have no temp sensors and sometimes the hanger and motors are very hot but my motors have no problems whit that at all.

@epss4 @richcan @Menjos @JeffDj **Drive Wheel Adapter Too Tight**

It could be the drive wheel on the top of the motor. You may need to space the gap a bit.

You can use tape and/or M4 washers to space the gap. Once the gap is spaced it should spin freely. 

I believe, the adapter is smashing the front bearing which adds resistance to the motor spinning so we want to space it out a bit.

@Jansen damn.. you just got all the luck. Are both motors having the issue or is it just one? It's most likely the heat issue that everyone's mentioned. I'd try what @McErono mentioned. 

@JeffDj you might need more lube on your bearings.

@Richcan Magnets are fine. I doubt magnets would be any issue. The magnets are surrounded by a thick steel retainer on both ends. They aren't going anywhere. :)

@McErono @Skatardude10 Appreciate you guys sharing your experiences.

Having a close look at the motor without issues, I noticed that looking from the side you can see a gap between the motor and the wheel adapter. And in this gap I can see something that looks like washers. The other motor, the one with the issue, has a smaller gap and I cannot see any washers:

Do not remove the bolts on the front motor cap which are on the side of the motor. Those don't need to be removed and there's definitely no washers there :smile: Those you will need to heat if you want to remove them.

Your last photo is correct. You want a gap between the motor and the drive wheel adapter. The second photo might have tape in-between instead of a washer.

It's a T20 Star/Torx bit.

I think you just want a spacer/washer up against the inner bearing race. So same diameter as it can rotate freely with bearing. It‚Äôs just to space wheel core from rubbing. If you find washer you might need to file down the outside diameter so it can rest up against the rotating equipment. That‚Äôs my guess till we can all see what it looks like under that core adapter? Good Luck!

OK guys so now I'm just confused. After unscrewing those bolts and putting them back in the issue has completely disappeared. So I thought it must be related to the tightness of the bolts, and I tightened them more to see if the issue would come back, but nooo.. the gap is now almost completely closed:

I'm not sure what the blue sticky tape is good for, and also not sure how to fit in those 6x M4 washers? I'd like to remove the adapter on the other wheel to compare what it looks like there, but my screwdriver is too small or I'm too weak.

Since the problem has magically evaporated, I'm wondering if this is a non-issue. After all @mcerono said to just ride them.

You can replace the tape for a standard M4 washer and they will fit in-between the bolt holes for the drive wheel adapter.

Depends how severe the issue is. If you can help it, you want nothing restricting the motor movement. You don't want to add any resistance if you don't have too.

**Regarding my loose engine.**

I tried to exchange the Abec cores, because I got the tip from @McErono  that maybe the wheels don't fit properly. Actually the loose motor should be fixed when I take the abec core from the solid motor. Well, I didn't manage to get the abec core off the solid motor. From the loose motor it was possible. 

Besides, I still have this grinding noise with the loose motor. I would be happy about a solution. The motors cost a fortune and I still don't know if the noise can be ignored.

On advice from @torqueboards I removed the wheel adapter and replaced the masking tape with M4 washers.  I also used some dry bike lube on the inner bearing.  It seems much better when hand turning but not completely gone.  I haven't tested it under power yet.  As soon as I get my Unity I'll ride it to see if it breaks in like @McErono suggested.

@torqueboards @McErono So Right before I saw your guys message I thought the same thing and bumped up mu temp cutoffs by around 10-15 degrees on each of them. Haven't had any issues since in the last week and have been letting other people try it out (without saying anything shhhhh) and everyone seems to enjoy them and like the power. Hit 36mph a couple nights ago. Free roll is amazing, can't get over it. So all good for now Dex, my only questions is what temp is too high for the esc and motors and am I already pushing it and could I blow a VESC soon cause of what I did, is there more room? Im pretty happy with how their runnin now but could always use a lil more power. Def can't go down from where I am though cause they're not usable there for me. Thanks for the help fellas.

@Jansen - Good to know! Hope you're enjoying it. :smile:

I'd try and keep it 120C / 248F max. I've always found that climbing steep hills back to back will increase temps esp. if you lose momentum on a hill. Magnets are good up to 150C / 302F.

We'll test more soon with the AT Tires also to see what kind of temps we get.

@Jansen took them on a very long trip (80km) with hills and stuff. Took them to 67km/h (based on Sport tracker, 110mm big wheels, 12s5p on the 90kv). They never reached more than 70 degrees C, and Unity 55 degrees C.

I believe for them to reach high temperature, I would have to be 100kg, and climb massive hill at 50km/h

@ThomasL Unfortunately I have killed many boards in my life but have learned from that over the years so I do what I can to try and keep wear and tear/temp/etc down on o my builds.... i.e. always taking a couple good pushes when starting from a stand still and not starting from a dead stop (esp on a hill), not trying to climb hill after hill after hill.... among other little things. I do weigh 210lbs and the city I live in has the dam word in the name (Anaheim Hills) so there is no avoiding some. I guess I am just a tad surprised these drives are getting as hot as they are so quick, hotter than my R2 hubs on the same run, but would still choose these every day cause the ride quality is night and day. 

And yeah @Sender, thats how I was always taught... you saying try something different or checking that I am doing it this way> Im open for suggestions.

![20190731_153855|281x500](upload://omV9ABqOOEtRx5dzbVPr8toTR8L.jpeg) 

They are good and all but they kinda "jingle" in a way I find a little annoying.  This is a nothing issue and wouldn't affect ridability in the slightest, but it would be nice to eliminate. 

Anyone doing anything for this?


Ok, well I am trying a dab of hot glue to silence the rattle. Just being careful to keep it away from the outer race.

@Sender the inner cir-clip you can actually remove if you want. You only need the larger cir-clip.

@topcloud I'm sure it would be fine. I'd just monitor your amps but pretty sure that will be fine since your using higher voltage.

Back again for an update after roughly 500km on the 90kv and 110mm...


![Capture|690x293](upload://ihqfMFzHzQyDXasXXBMRORIovF.jpeg) 

Went pretty much 60km (with the carving), took them to a massive massive hill (120 meters), full throttle, roughly 40/45km/h all the way. The motors got super hot (95C) and were stuttering afterwards for 2/3 min until they went back to 65C.

 @torqueboards Is that normal/ok for you ? Should I stop putting so much pressure on them not to damage them ?
Furthermore, the cans are taking a beating, would there be any possibility in the future to buy the cans, if anybody wants to replace them ?

And last but not least, do you have already a date to share with us regarding the AT conversion kit ? Would love to give them a proper adversary (Prague's city center roads and pot holes)

Janux is already proposing theirs for Bergmeister, for roughly 265$, will yours be priced the same/lower ?

Regarding the 110mm... Still the same, no issue, no cut, no chunk, splendid ! Wondering how much KM I can put on them before having to change them...

Shall be back after the 1000 km mark ;)

@ThomasL Thanks for the updates.

Are you using the temp sensors on the motors?

Ultimately, you don't want to get them too hot. There's a breaking point. Just as long as you don't go past it you won't burn out a motor and everything will be fine if you let it cool down. Typical for all motors but that threshold is more prone for a direct drive/hub motor.

As far as AT Kit will be soon. Waiting on stock on tires + testing the DD adapter which should be soon. Price should be about $199.99 including adapters.

@ThomasL I'd probably test to see if you can do 120C or less.

@Ubbiedude It would be harder too. IMO Not worth the change/fix. Typically, all you need to do is ride and then touch your motors to see how hot they get. If they don't get hot at all then there's no reason to use sensors.

@rideTastic Your motor shouldn't be doing that. You'll need to take it apart and show us what's actually causing your motor to rock back and forth. Please update your support email.

So after 10km on of my motor is completely fuck ....
I guess its the bearing , there is a very loud noise coming from one motor , i did take out the wheel adapter to see if it was the problem (since it was creating a restriction in the beginning) but no, the sound is still there 
At this point my journey with @torqueboards
-first time they ship to the wrong adress i guess because it got return to them after 2 week of waiting and had never leaves the  U.S , after they receive it back i had to wait to more week to receive them 
-i finally got the motor but there was bad restriction coming from the wheel adapter (had to fix this my self )
-when my build it was finally ready one motor broke after 10km 
The product look really amazing but im so disappointed, at this point im gonna miss 3/4 of the summer or maybe all the summer if they do not have any spare in stock ....
PLEASE HELP ME  @torqueboards  :frowning:

For people with overheating problems you guys should try Statorade, lots of data of using it on ebike hubs

https://www.ebikes.ca/shop/electric-bicycle-parts/motor-hardware/cooling-mods/statorade.html

The problem is that since the hanger is almost all motor, there is almost no surface area for the heat to be dissipated, and the air gap between the stator and magnets is a awful heat conductor, Statorade bridge that cap and turns the hole motor can in a heat sink

@torqueboards maybe you could do some tests with it and include it as a upgrade for those who want to push the drives

Fml. So glad that this bearing blew out after I was mobbing downhill over 30 mph‚Äôs for a few minutes just beforehand. Got to a buddies and leaned to make uturn kinda thing to cruise up his driveway and as soon as i lean heard. Pop. Couldn‚Äôt find my wheel and liknsweet old lady walked it up to me from like 50ft away. I tighten / check all my shit before every ride too and the other front wheels I started hearing a little noice this week and had planned to swap one or both bearings cause I could tell one was fucked and squeaking. The side that blew out sounded completely fine. Anyone else have anything like this happen. Are these just generic kind of bearings Dex @torqueboards or what are you guys using that come with the wheels? Just curious.....

@Jansen - Glad your okay. Not sure if you have great luck or bad luck. We use ABEC7 Bearings. Haven't had this issue happen before with our current bearings.

@rideTastic - You'll need to update your ticket if you have an existing one.

@ClarkMitchell - Mostly likely your 10s2p is good for about 20-30amp cont. I'd put about 15amps each motor.

@Dasnewten - Yes, some of the first motors we were shimming with tape. We've since switched over to M4 washers.

I run 80A per motor, pretty sure that is the recommended max amp limit. 4000-4500 watts per motor I think? 

12S is common, that or any other voltage common for eboards should be fine.

That's really all you need to set these up, just battery settings based off your battery specs, motor settings based off that and tweak to your liking. I don't think a vesc setup tutorial needs to be included, there are tons of tutorials, written and video online already.

As for max temp cutoffs, I just stick with vesc tool defaults, 85C I think. It's way lower than what the magnets can handle which is I think around 120-130C. Just be conservative if you want to play it safe with cutoffs. If you do CPU overclocking, I think of 120-130C as the Tj Max... But long term stable temps are usually safe being much lower than that.

@rideTastic Unless the hanger grew 10-20mm. The motor shrunk 10-20mm. Which aren't really possible.

The motor was designed to slip out of the hanger axle without a wheel attached.

1. It's most likely going to be a loose axle (which you would need to check).
2. The fitment to your wheel (which you would need to check).

You'll need to give me more details to work on instead of shifting the motor back and forth and saying it doesn't work.

The motors are designed to slide off the axles, and if a wheel is not installed they should slide off. If they are sliding around with a wheel installed, you might have to adjust your wheels bearing spacers or take the motor off and tighten the axles on tight. To make sure the axles don't come loose, I used isopropyl alcohol to clean whatever loctite they used off the axle threads, and dribbled some loctite blue on, and tightened the crap out of them and didn't ride hard for about 24 hours for the loctite to fully dry.

If your wheels are on, axles tight, bearing spacers installed correctly, axle nut torqued down a bit (correctly sized spacers absolutely necessary for this, with speed rings or not on one side or the other to get wheel as close as possible to drive motor without strain on the motor), and the motor is still sliding around, I'd double check all the screws on the motor are tight. If they are all tight, how much is the motor moving? Just a bit along the hangar, in and out from the wheel? Maybe space your wheel a bit closer to the motor to tighten it up? Curious...

Got an email for a pre-order but doesn't link me to the pneumatics with DD adapters?

Anybody else have their motors (or a motor in my case) seize up on them and anyone know a fix or is it just a bad motor? @torqueboards I swear I can‚Äôt catxh a break with these things.... they were running fine (good for what they have been) and was cruising around when all of a sudden I felt resistance from one of the motors. When I flipped the board over sure enough one motor had pretty much no free roll anymore and I could easily see and feel the resistance on one side. Next day (today) put the drives on a new deck and swapped from 2 focbixes to the unity I finally got in the mail yesterday and they rode good for the first 5 minutes (all flat roads and no hills even) at the 6th minute I felt the resistance again and the motor just cogs I try to give it gas. You can tell by the sound too, instead of quiet stealthiness it‚Äôs line a louder jet engine is what I would compare it too. Way louder than the other motor and normal coasting. Please tell me this is something dumb and there‚Äôs an easy fix Dex.....? 

PS - I took a video when I got back home. Lmk if you want me to send it.... Can I not post videos here? Thought I could.....?

I‚Äôm actually fucking with it right now. def not the phase wires at all unless there is something going on inside the can where I can see..... still feels seized even when unplugged and disconnected from everything. Running FOC sensored.  A couple times when the motors have gotten noticeably hot I have smelt something but it wasn't so much burning really and more like fresh grease or oil or some type of sealant burning off from being new.. dont know for sure though. Its strange cause it seized up like this yesterday then today after I switched decks and 2 FB's for a new unity it started off fine but then after 5 minutes its back to seized and unrideable where that motor barely rolls. It just kind of cogs when you give it some throttle like it wants to work, but nope. I re-ran motor detection and everything passes fine. There are some numbers that are a lil differs from  each other which I‚Äôm assuming is the resistance or something because normally they are only a digit or so off unlike it is in the picture included. I also included a link to video I took after I got home earlier today when this happened.

Do you have the same issue? @Eskate444 My shit isn't even rideable.... (not a real word I know). I really don't get how these things get so hot. I'm going to have to get a replacement motor, aren't I..... I swear I've only been able to do around 2-4 out of the 20 times I've tried to go for a ride on these things that something doesn't have an issue. Not even pushing it anywhere near I do my other boards and how I typically ride either.... hoping it's just a lemon or something and not how they will all be. LMK what you want me to do Dex @torqueboards This thing doesn't seem like its going to be useable without completely dissaembling and prolly fixing whatever is causing the seizing. Other motor seems good as know still. Silber lining....?

Does anyone have any recommendations for Bluetooth modules to use with torqueboards VESC‚Äôs?

I‚Äôm thinking about going in another direction for VESC‚Äôs but they are pricey. Spent enough for now. 

That said I‚Äôve tried Build Kit Boards Bluetooth module and they‚Äôre both toast as soon as I plug them into the VESC‚Äôs. Their customer service told me the issue is with the VESC and I should just bugger off.  

The first one worked for a minute and then died so i got a preview of how it works and the software abilities and I like the idea of having the ability to update the VESC‚Äôs without my computer and or the ability to track performance on a ride.  But I can‚Äôt get one to work reliably at all. 

Is this another reason to use some other VESC‚Äôs? Maybe a focbox?

Amazing 75kv motors. Was worried I‚Äôd have trouble with low speed braking, but have no issues at all. Brakes are strong unlike 2wd Carvon speed drives, which I ultimately had to go 4wd to get decent brakes.

Was worried about torque with these huge wheels. Was expecting to have to put smaller wheels on but 100-110mm feels great. Strong.

Such a nice free roll. Fast. I really love these motors.

Yeah, the free roll. Got on my board today for the first time in a week or two and was caught off guard. Zealous ceramics + these and the free roll feels like a normal longboard, just with momentum of a heavy board.

I sent them an email prior to placing my order to confirm they had stock and could swap out one of my baseplates for the 35¬∞ plate and they were able to accommodate. My 35¬∞ plates are bulkier than the 50¬∞.

Here are some pics if you want to know what they are like in comparison. I wonder if they are still being made, or if it's just leftover stock for now.

You're right, the startup cogging in the beginning sounds normal. Regarding the rest of the sound, if those were mine i'd ride them for a bit and see if it gets worse. I wouldn't push them too hard for a little while until you know its either getting worse or better. If your motors are faulty you should have no issues getting them replaced or fixed, and if it goes away that's even better. One of my motors sounded a little odd and didn't spin as well as the other when I first got them but after a couple rides out they both spin perfect and now I couldn't tell you which motor it was.

Finally everything is setup properly. The motors are running smoothly now in FOC and without any issues. Also had a high frequency whining noise after the first day as described by others, a few drops "bones speed cream" on the inner bearings and it's gone. Also had a bit of rattling as the motors are sitting on the trucks with a tiny bit of play, put some insolation tape in there, also gone now.

I have a set of TB 110mm wheels sitting here in case anyone is interested. They are simply too huge for my setup. Hanger width is also massive, was thinking about cutting out some rubber from so I can mount the offset wheels in reverse. But I'm actually starting to like the wide hangers, adds a lot of stability.

The axle isn‚Äôt the issue because the motor will fit over the axle and the hanger. Most likely you might have a tighter tolerance. You can use a soft mallet to push the motor in more and or try that motor on the opposite side.

I‚Äôd also take the wheel off and mount without the wheel first. Try that first. :slight_smile:

@torqueboards just want to say, job well done I absolutely love these motors, pure silent power, just quality. I thought it might be a bit tight from the motor can to the hanger so I added a small spacer there, very little clearance in there, so just pre-empting any issues that may occur when hot.. But wow, absolutely love these trucks wheels and motors.. Nicely done mate.. ! Thanks.

I'm confused because I own the storm esk8 wheels that are on your board in this photo and the 110s and honestly they are pretty close in size. The storm esk8 wheels hurt range a pretty significant amount though they do much better in the rain for sure.
```

---
## \#2275 Posted by: Menjos Posted at: 2019-10-24T15:15:40.803Z Reads: 141

There is actually quite a difference, the real diameter of the storm esk8's is only about 102mm, not 105 - and that's only for the center of the wheel. So I guess they would have about 20-25% less volume. Also visually they are ok for my built, while the Torqueboards just looks too massive. That being said, I might change my mind. I still have to give them a try! So far the rubber wheels are perfect for my daily commute, with lot's of steep terrain. I love the rubber. I don't think they will hurt range that much in this scenario, and I don't mind either.

Well I out a couple hundred miles on the storm esk8 and between my gear drive and the rubber wheels I averaged 15 miles on a 12s4p Samsung 30q battery back. I should mention I got 20-22 miles on my 97mm urethanes with the same belt drive.  As for my 110mm wheels and direct drive I'm hitting 25 miles fairly consistantly. The rubber wheels were softer and more comfortable but they have a ton more rolling resistance.

Hey Dexter @torqueboards - I got my Torque DD Torque set up with Torque Vescs. Testing in the neighborhood I noted that the torque from a start is minimal. I push it to full throttle and it speeds up pretty slowly. It also kinda dies on hills at low speed. I think it would be fine if I hit the hill above about 15 - 20 mph. I live in a hilly area, so do you have Vesc settings that would provide more torque at low speeds?
Thanks!

That's impossible, there must be a noticeable braking force going from -15A to -30A.

You will have a stronger braking force but only at high speeds over 25km/hr, at lower speeds there will no much change, so the next question would be, are you braking in low speeds or high speeds?

Got the same issue (TB DD 90 KV), brakes are strong going over 10km/h, but with lower speed, they are not so much present, I usually stop completely by foot braking... I like it to be honest, since my raptor locked its hubs while braking, flipped me over and broke my wrist in 3 places.

Haven't tried yet the Current Smart Reverse, but I believe it should help with low speed braking.

Torqueboard dd 75kv motors on board with braking issue. The other board had Torqueboard 6380 170KV motors on the board with awesome braking.

There's your problem.  direct drives and belt drives are different in how they behave in braking.
Do what they suggested and you should be fine :)

Wow I‚Äôm shocked. I also noticed my direct drives didn‚Äôt have amazing brakes. It would scare me if I lived in San Francisco.

I want to understand this a bit better.  Since direct drive does not have the torque advantage at lower speeds that belts offer (since there is no gear reduction), the braking curve is different.  While brakes will work just fine at higher speeds, once speeds get below a certain threshold the motor isn't spinning fast enough to provide sufficient stopping power with regenerative breaking. Using the Smart Current Reverse would essentially apply current in reverse which would add to the stopping power of the board below this threshold.  Adding AT wheels to the mix would then compound this state and raise the speed threshold at which the Smart Current Reverse would need to be applied.  I would imagine the challenge here would be in making the braking curve feel continuous as it transitions from regenerative to current reverse.  Does this correctly describe the DD + Smart Current Reverse approach?

The Torque motor comes with 5.5 mm (I assume?) bullet connectors (blue arrow in picture below), the Trampa VESC 6 Plus, however, comes with 4 mm female connectors (magenta arrow in picture below). Thus, can I just cut off the motor wire or remove the 5.5 mm bullet connectors and solder 4 mm connectors for each 5.5 mm connector and this should be good?

Id rather change the esc adapters to 5.5

The wire lenght of esc is longer and does not have a sleeve on it so u dont have to adjust that lenght of the sleeve either 

in my build the wires from direct drives from torqueboard should not be any shorter in my opinion

Thanks a lot for your suggestion - good point. I will check my build and see whatever fits better; you are right, these motor wires are quite short.

Is there perhaps a 5.5 mm female to 4.0 mm male bullet connector available that I could use? Never soldered anything before, although I hope soldering these connectors should not be too difficult?

Hey guys pretty new to esk8ing. I built a board with the torqueboard 90 kv DD motors using the vesc6.6 and the 12s4p battery from mboards. (i know not the best place to get stuff) Anyhow after setting everything up I had the max motor current set to 75A which i figured is safe given the 80A limit for the motors. Everything seemed fine when i was going up a pretty decent sized hill and about 3/4 of the way up i lost all power and went flying. Not sure if this is due to low voltage cutoff of the battery or the BMS on the battery pack. Any suggestion values to set on the vesc would be great. thanks in advance.

If your bms is wired for charge/discharge then that might be your issue, you will need to use a new bms with more rated current or change the wiring of the BMS to be used only for discharge

The low voltage cut off is pretty subtle in my experience, not gunna launch u. U could see if that‚Äôs what happened checkingvthe voltage of the battery  It‚Äôs two tiered and u don‚Äôt lose all power at first tier

You should ask the battery builder how was the BMS wired?, charge/discharge or charge only.

Please also ask what BMS, brand and model and maximum current specs, he did install. Some BMS cutout while on maximum current and you loose everything from brakes to power.

the 4WD direct drive has torque as hell with 4X 60A powered !

I would not put such holes in it might break faster

How heavy is your board mine is 16kg
4wd i would take a bigger battery and mostly for ofroad like on the beaches but thats when its legalized sadly

Already got a fine riding on meepo board 10km/h cause not insured which is not posible...

Focboxunity
12s8p 30q 120a
Yea 75kv dual drive is powerful alot of torque

Any word on the 60kv stator variation + the AT adapters?  There's this offering over at [Esk8supply.shop DD + AT](https://www.esk8supply.shop/product-page/direct-drive-with-all-terrain-rubber-wheels).  These looks like a refined version of the eLofty hardware with a heat treated axle and custom adapters using 58kv stators.  I really like the look of the TB pneumatic AT adapters in this thread, but the 160mm airless tires + adapter for this kit look like a good solution as well.
