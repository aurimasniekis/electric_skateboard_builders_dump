i'm thinking about adding it to my parts list for various lighting effects. It seems to get good reviews.

I'm not sure if it will work for EL wire though, i think that stuff runs at 12V, but it would definitely work for 5v SMD and traditional LED underlights. It seems the ones offering dual 5v and 12v output are kinda pricy.

I am using this one: http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__86591__UBEC_DUO_4A_5_12V_4A_5V.html

It has a 12v output and looks like the same price as the above one in the AUD.

El wire is A/C so you'll need a converter

Sbec is not gonna be good in your application...simpler just to split the line and make one dedicated 12v to power lighting

i've just found a couple of really small EL inverters that run off 3-5v so i might just go that route instead of trying to do a separate 12v feed.
