Hi guys! When I bought this Turnigy motor I also got the little ring you see in the pictures that can be fixed on the shaft with a little screw. 
But how can I use it? Of course it has to have some kind of purpose but I haven't found it out (so far). 

Suggestions will be greatly appreciated üôÉ

Very odd piece. Unfortunately never seen that shipped with a motor before. At least the ones I ordered from Maytech didn't though. looks it was to be used as a pulley sorts but no teeth for that purpose. My best guess is it was an error on the manufacturer's part that left it there by accident. Doesn't appear to serve any purpose for us as far as I can observe

I also haven¬¥t seen it before.
could be some kind of distance holder.
I don¬¥t know of any purpose for it.
important just that there is this black circle ring behind on the shaft.

Distance holder could be a good guess. Can't be sure tho

That's usually used to prevent the motor can/axis from moving when there is no circlip. Since this motor has a circlip, that ring is not needed. The SK8 for example needs a modification like this.

Don't really think so, if you buy the [replacement pack](https://hobbyking.com/it_it/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-50-xx-spare-accessory-pack.html) you'll still get one of these.

oh... lol guess thats why you generally don't see them packaged together with other motors

I think it‚Äôs for reverse mounting the shaft.

@Static has the correct part. They are used to hold stuff at a certain point upon a shaft or to keep it from sliding further down. You don't need it, but an RC vehicle might.

If you google ‚Äúreverse mount SK3 shaft‚Äù you will probably be able to see.

Ok, got it! But what is the purpose of reversing the shaft?

```
These motors were designed for RC airplanes etc., so in some situations it is more suitable to have the shaft reversed.  For esk8 there is no reason to reverse.

That is used for when your using motor with propeller for r.c. airplanes. Regular esk8 motors dont come with that piece.

Are those the 6374? If so those motors are capable of running an extended shaft. It goes through the whole motor and out the back of the can. You can essentially have dual wheel drive with it. I vaguely remember someone posting a thread about it months ago.

Edit: I may be mistaken as that thread may be on another site.
