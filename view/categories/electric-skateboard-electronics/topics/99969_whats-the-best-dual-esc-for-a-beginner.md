I'm new to ESK8 in general, and I'm trying to go for dual motors. What are the best ESCs in general and what are good options for dual motors?

Thanks!

I would recommend getting a Dual VESC. 

The generic ESCs are cheap but jerky and don't put out too much power.

What size motors? For dual 6354 or bigger get a cheap dual vesc 4.20 from flipsky.

For hub motors use the hobbwing esc. Most cheap chinese boards use them as of recently and they are excellent compared to the non hobbywing ones.

probably around 6354, but I haven't fully decided yet. I'll take a look at flipsky I think.

Thanks!
