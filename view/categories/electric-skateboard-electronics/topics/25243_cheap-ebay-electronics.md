Hello!

I am starting my first build and I'm trying to keep the initial costs a bit low for this first one. I have seen a few people talk about this ESC:  [two in one ESC](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Dual-motors-longboard-skateboard-controller-with-remote-ESC-Substitute-/302332736118?var=&hash=item46646f7276:m:mfx-qzZdIxn8ZrfP1Gbxebg)

From the same seller I found these motors: [Double hub motors](http://www.ebay.com/itm/83mm-dual-5060-hub-motors-drive-kit-for-electric-skateboard-longboard-part/302325966568?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIM.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D41375%26meid%3D484de22db19e4c349135a007826ec003%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D3%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D302325948006)

However, I cant find anything about those. I'm curious about what you think about these motors, and about the combination with the dual ESC. I'm not looking for a incredibly high speed build but 15mph would be nice to achieve, also braking is kind of a must. 

Thanks in advance :)

I think if you buy these parts you will find that your board is slow and underpowered and wont climb hills much steeper than a drive way. I suggest forking out some extra money to buy quality proven parts so you don't build a board that leaves you wanting more from day 1. I had similar ideas when I started but wish I had just bought the good stuff form the start. 

Torqueboards hub motors are the cheapest Id recommend. Ive had a ton of fun with them. The Carvon motors are the most powerful and reliable. Hummie's newest hubs are almost ready as well.

Ive spent well over $1000 on speed controller's now. I only buy  VESC-x, Ollins, Torqueboards, and the new VESC-6 as all the rest ive tried overheat or blow drv's. Replacing your. VESC once already pays for the difference in buying a good one from the start.

Thats just my 2cents, but if I could do it again I take my own advice. It would have saved me a couple thousand dollars.

Just out of curiosity, I would buy these components for myselfâ€‹, but never recommend someone else to spend his money on something cheap from a dodgy eBay seller. 
In general I agree with BigBoyToys, spending the extra money for a quality product is worth it.

On the other hand, these components look a lot like the ones used for the Lou Board: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lou-shes-esk8-on-kickstarter/21152/172
And the idea of building a dirt cheap board that's not worse than the Lou is tempting. 
If the specs of these components aren't highly over exaggerated, an 8s battery should get you up to +15mph.

cant find anything about the motors though, thought they kind of look like the juiced board though [juiced](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,h_240,w_320/v1497030535/uawxhwmsilpftvsnjqbm.jpg)
