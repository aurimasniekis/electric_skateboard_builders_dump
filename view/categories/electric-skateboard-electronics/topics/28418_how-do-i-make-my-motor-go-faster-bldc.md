Hi, I have a [6355 190KV Motor] (diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv/), two 5000 mah 3s1p 20c Lipo Batteries and a [Vesc 4.12](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/). I found that my motor has been going slower than usual. 

Here are my BLDC Tool Screenshots:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/0/80f48f2dec2135a6569a356d3dd566b1c1a97657.PNG" width="690" height="406"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/f/afdcb4d032288531375d0d81ca1ed300918b69bb.PNG" width="690" height="408"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/3/f373a2a46ed0c5a85e3533cac4c10a3183f41541.PNG" width="690" height="406"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/4/14352b2be977351a85214f9237c7a0d567def35d.PNG" width="690" height="409">

Thank you in advance!!

190kv is a bit low for 6s. I'd upgrade to 10-12s or throw another 3s lipo in there for 9s. You can change gearing for more speed, but right now your setup isn't the most efficient. 

Also, run and apply motor detection, it's at default right now.

Thanks for the quick response! So what batteries should I get... Including mah, cellls and c. Also, should I change anything in my settings besides motor detection? Thanks again!

Buy the same 5000 mAh 3s 20c lipo, preferably from the same manufacturer. Run all of them in series to get a total of 9s1p (5000mAh).

Welp, not much you can do then, unless you wanna make / find another enclosure.

But @Jinra is right; 190kv is not optimal for 6s. When running through a speed calc, are your speeds close, or is it something else?

Here are all your options for increasing speed:

* Get a larger motor pulley, or
* Buy bigger wheels, or
* Make/find a smaller wheel pulley, or
* Buy a higher KV motor (up ~330kV), or
* Increase system voltage, or
* Add jet packs

I know someone with a new 6355 260kV motor that is looking for a 190kV that you have.  If you are interested in a swap, let me know.  That will fix your problem instantly

You say you want to go faster. How fast are you going on your current setup? I am running 2x3s 5000mAh 30s batteries on a 6355 190kv motor. 16Tx36T on Orangatang Kegel wheels. Yesterday I went 9 miles on a charge, averaged 13.7 mph and maxed at 18.5 mph. Elevation gain was 111 ft.

If I am correct, lower kv rating is higher torque so I would like to maintain my torque and increase my speed.

I'm no electrical D.C. Motor expert, but I'd caution you about the lower kv / higher torque assumption. There are extensive threads about it already. I have a 260kv and more torque than I need. Adding the extra 3s to go to 9s is a solid suggestion. Get creative and make the room if you can.

More importantly, if your board used to run at twice the speed, and you haven't changed anything in your setup, then you have problem to investigate. Just adding more power is akin to turning up the radio when your car starts to make a knocking sound.

I'd take a good look at your batteries. You say that you had performance and are now losing it. Perhaps your cells might be getting a little tired, and sag their voltage under current now. Are you experiencing a drop in range?

I used some cheap lipos for my first build from hobbyking. I was also using a vesc, a 4.12 from Enertion. The batteries were great when I first bought them, the board had a lot of punch. After a good amount of cycles, the performance dropped significantly, both acceleration and range. Built a new pack and had my performance back. 

Best of luck!

```
People often run their lipos too low.
Charge them to 4.2V per cell and discharge them to 3.5V. 
If you run them lower over time, youÂ´ll damage them.

I also had bad experience with low C rating lipos. 6S with 20C 5000mah sucks pretty hard on hills and sag a lot.

Yep, your battery is probably ''broken''. I don't se any other reason why this would happen.

And i don't get how you managed to get that 20-25mph. What is your gearing? You can't get that speed even with 100mm wheels.

I don't understand either how you were able to get 20-25 out of a 2x3s 190kv motor. The max I've been able to get out of that configuration is 17.5 and I think I was going downhill.

@TJBoards

I think that there were many factors that added up.

1. My board is new

2. I am riding on new roads

3. I think my gearing set up is pretty good

My daughter is only 90 lbs. and her board has the same exact setup as mine now and she doesn't go any faster on her board than mine. We both have a top speed of 21.7 mph. 6s lipo battery, 16/36 gearing, 6355 260kv single motor.

I saw this a couple of weeks ago and i've been racking my head trying to come up with a solution.. but then last night it came to me in a fit of delirium like so many brilliant ideas do. 

I'm pretty sure this will resolve your issue. I would only use this for short bursts, and at the end you might notice a startling end to the boost but this is extremely efficient. Almost no additional battery power is used and you'll dramatically increase your motor RPMs.

You may need to adjust the belt length and of course the distance between pulleys, and you may need some additional room around the motor can, but i'm positive this is exactly what you're looking for.

might be that you got the wrong ESC. These are available for 6 and 10s i think and for Hubs or Beltdrive. Each is different.
You might have a HUB ESC for 10s, so you are below that with 9s and it might also be that yours is for Hubs only.
