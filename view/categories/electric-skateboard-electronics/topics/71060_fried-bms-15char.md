So I had some space issues so I started moving the bms but then all of the sudden it sparked. It was a small spark and I’m pretty sure it was coming from the bms. I had someone else put this together but he did not include the e switch in de circuit so now my 15 amp switch is acting as a fuse...not so good. But now when I try to plug my focbox it doesn’t power up anymore. 
The battery still has the right voltage so that is fine I guess. 
What is going on?

your bms has an eswitch, don't use that 15a switch you'll cook it

How do you know if your bms still works?
I can’t see any burn marks

a smallest spark/pop/smoke from a bms means its dead/ not safe to use
