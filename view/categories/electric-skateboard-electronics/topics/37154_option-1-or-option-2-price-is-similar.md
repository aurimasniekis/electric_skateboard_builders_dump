So I’m undecided on these 2 options basically,

1)<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/8/c80145469c77ca36e846cf7b1fdb0b0ba1d80396.jpg" width="281" height="499">

Or

2)<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/f/9fd5b30bb104864345f0eae096dc4c091ed1c54a.jpg" width="281" height="499">

basically I have to decide like this, 1)same or close to same price. 2) same series, 10s.   3)quality (I’m curious if the hard packs are that much better in quality) 4)would I need the difference in amps when both packs are so high output anyways

wiring is much easier on 2x 5s. and charging too.
