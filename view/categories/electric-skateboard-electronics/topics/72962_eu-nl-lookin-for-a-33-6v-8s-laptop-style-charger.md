I have a 8s battery but i am still looking for a power supply, i would love a laptop style power supply but any portable solution is welcome, also on a budget so i can't afford these crazy 100 euro lipo chargers or something.

anyobody who has one or knows where to get one in the netherlands?

I have a 2a one you can have bud, shoot me a PM with your address and I'll get a shipping quote. Just cover the postage from the UK. Can send tomorrow morning.

Edit: it'll be a UK plug
