If your using just a cheap toggle switch to power on and off, there will be extreme arc damage inside the switch that can cause intermittent interruption of current flow and eventually complete failure.
I experienced the same thing using an automotive breaker switch.

You need either to make a loop key with an anti-spark connector or buy an anti-spark E-switch.
