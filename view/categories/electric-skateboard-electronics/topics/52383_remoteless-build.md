I'm curious about remoteless builds? anyone have any success building one or is this the unicorn?

Mellow drive's "endless ride" mode takes care of acceleration part, has anyone reproduced the functionality in an open source ESC?

What about remoteless breaking? 
Has anyone tried adding a tilt sensor to differentiate between foot dragging and going up a hill?

Theres been a few attempts out there but nothing thats been a slam dunk at least to my knowledge.  Here are two examples:
Zboard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ3st3vyb0k
Spectra: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-poFKdw5ek

IMHO... My feet is busy enough steering and staying on the board... I don't need them to have to worry about tilting or pressing the right spot on the board.

This while remotless thing is pretty restricting, your limited to low low speeds 10-14mph because u need to be able to move your leg back and forward from the pads, also that I dout the technology is safe .

@Nordle 
Seems like 99% of members of the community here are obsessed with just going faster.
Lets design something more dynamic
Something like this

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohhk_9AhXB0

just minus a remote?

@lowGuido love your board! I think you are on the same page. Do you still have the board in this config? How has it held up during irl testing? How much does this improve the battery range? Did you try to add speed by pumping instead of pushing? The stomp pad seems like a valid solution, though may need to be a bit larger.

First, this type of board doesn't appear to exist yet. Secondly look at all the open source projects! The goal isn't to undermine someone but to benefit everybody by sharing expertise and ideas.

This is also OT, but i like cheap chinese stuff. I would never buy a crappy complete, but what is wrong with an 2$ arduino instead of a genuine one for 20$. I don‘t need an answer just to give you something to think about...

This (remoteless board) would probably be an arduino + some other electric components. I would definitely build from chinese parts.

I'm the same...I love cheap Chinese stuff too. 

You know how easy it is to buy $30 worth of shit(10-20+ items) and forget about it and then a month later it's like Christmas in your mailbox? Had I bought the real deals(marked up nonsense that came from China) I'd of been out of pocket a couple hundred likely. I'm not saying it for everything. But man... How else do you keep the shit cheap. Here is a perfect example.

- US M4 *20mm 200pc $36.99 + shipping
- china m4*20mm 200pc, $6.99, free shipping

Pick your battles... Line your pockets with cheap Chinese stuff. And use the $ you saved, on other quality parts that MATTER. 

Poster above me is spot on... I'm not paying for a genuine Arduino - unless my project is chipset/memory specific.. 10pack of nanos is like $11 shipped... Why would I pay $16 for one...

I think the push/pump assist feature is pretty straightforward, and easy to implement using a VESC without any additional hardware.

The deceleration seems to be the tricky bit, and this is what I wanted to hear some discussion about possible designs. Keep in mind I'm not considering this for high speed boards, just low speed cruisers that go as fast as you can kick.

There are two basic scenarios, controlled braking and emergency fall off.

Controlled braking might work like this:
ESC feeds steady current and reads the RPM and cuts power to motor and coast if the RPM reading drops, such as a drop from added resistance of a foot dragging.
The problem is the same would happen on an uphill slope, so maybe you'd need to add a tilt sensor to differentiate the two. 

Emergency falloff / runaway board:
This could be addressed with a weight sensor on the trucks or a proximity RF chip in an ankle bracelet, that would start braking if RF sensor is not in range. Spectra seems to have this feature, anyone know the implementation?
Would an unloaded motor at steady current experience  a sudden jump in rpm that could be differentiated from one caused by a foot push?
```

Why do you say that?

In this case "emergency" implies you jumped or fell off the board and are no longer in control. At the very least you need to cut power, ideally also engage breaks to avoid the board shooting into an intersection. Both should be doable with a sensor on the trucks for example.

How would this sensor work? Do I have to press it or is it wireless? What would happen when it breakes? Is there redundant one or will I be stopped instantanously and shoot into the air? If it’s wirelles how fast would it brake on connection lost or some kind of interference? What is the range of this sensor? What about going downhill? How would it distinguish pushing from accelerating down?

```
Several builds  implemented some version of this already, such as this
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/weight-sensing-longboard-build/19193

Sensor is a tiny stress sensor on the truck, its wired to the ESC, it measures deformation of the metal under load, no load=apply breaking, in case of failure ideally nothing happens, maybe an audio tone, your emergency brake just doesn't work. Has nothing to do with pushing or going up hill, should only activate when there's no rider.

Its been stated several times in the thread already.  

"Keep in mind I’m not considering this for high speed boards, just low speed cruisers that go as fast as you can kick."

Plenty of people go down hills on boards now with no breaks of any kind. But if that's a concern, its a couple of lines of code to add a hard limit on max speed the board will let you reach, so that you won't accelerate past your safe running speed.

I still don’t think that going limited 10 to 20kph with no emergency brakes is safe so I’m going to stay with the remote but you could just use available arduino remote code and tinker with it. It’s not that hard and communication with vesc is already done, add a button for starters, limit speed to 5kph and go from there.

Consider following scenarios: 
* going spiral down the parking lot and noticing there are few cars stuck cause the barrier broke
* going straight but crowded pavement
* going empty road but 35 kids run out of school 10m in front of you

Doesn't the vesc have access to rpm data from the motor (sensored motor)? 
If that's that case the additional friction (from the foot breaking), under constant current, would cause a sudden drop in the rpm, which could trigger the vesc to  reduce current to 0 and coast, allowing the rider to continue further slowing the board with his foot to a stop. Am I misunderstanding something?

Ommiting high powered, high torque setup that might not notice much, wouldn’t terrain elevation do the same? That is the problem I’m talking about from the beginning. The same is when you accelerate, every hill would accelerate you to vmax but I guess here we could connect it with the foot detection procedure(described further) and block acceleration. We could get sensor detecting that you moved your shoe on a side of the board connected with a mic data so the system would ignore most other objects passing by. That would engage brakes only in scenario when the foot is on the side of the board and noise levels (actual foot dragging) are above certain treshold. That should minimize false detections to certain degree and allow you to slow down while dowhill. Dragging your foot for 1s while downhill would stop acceleration, dragging longer would slow down deck until you disengage your feet or stop you completely when the foot is in braking mode. This unfortunately makes it pretty hard do turn and brake at the same time but then I’d also make rider detection that would stop the motor instantenoulsly when you’re out of the board and15kph vmax should be pretty safe to jump off. Accelerating would work in simillar manner only the foot movement would be detected by two sensors one after another that would cause rise in wheel rpm. This new higher rpm level would be your new high speed. There could be also an option to gradually slowing you down (more natural/Mellow style) or staying at the top speed until you start braking. 

Sensors are to be selected, I’d go with rfid sensors with foot bracelet for added security but for testing any proximity sensor should do.

@webst I think key is to keep it simple. The last thing we want is add signal processing on an audio channel.

Originally, in order to differentiate uphill from foot drag I proposed tilt sensor, but you just gave me an even simpler idea.

Switch to coasting if BOTH conditions are met 
1) additional drag on the rpm from foot dragging
2) stomp pad for the rear foot detects NO pressure.

This allows you to safely control speed via foot drag, shift your feet around while skating as much as you like and maintain power and still be able to cruise up a hill as long as you keep your back foot down on the stomp pad.

Additionally board comes to automatic stop if front AND back stomp pad have zero pressure for a full second.

Can anyone confirm that a VESC can in fact reliably detect additional load on the motors via drop in RPM??

I still think that you want to detect temperature difference in boiling kettle after putting your finger inside. It might work for certain temperature levels and some fairly underpowered kettle. Either way: not safe at all.

i don't quite understand. which part of the design you are referring to?

yes, the design i'm considering is for low powered boards ONLY, foot breaking becomes difficult at high speeds. I can't imagine a remoteless build being remotely safe or feasible for high powered boards.

"safe" is a relative term after all. I'm assuming basic skating skills for the user, and the goal is to build something not 100% safe but at least no more dangerous then unpowered boards. For example its possible to generate unsafe speeds downhill when unpowered etc. People need to use good judgement and skate within their limits.

High powered doesn't mean high speed, I'm not sure if I could generate any noticable spike while foot dragging on my rather popular setup (10s dual 190kV 2,5kW belt drive 16/36). It might as well get unnoticed or your board might easily generate higher spikes by itself on small elevation. You'd also need to constantly calculate base point for this spike to even detect it as it needs to work for any speed in a range. I'd go with another button on side of the board that you would press while not having your foot on a foot pad that would engage braking. Easier and more reliable. If you want to go the other way I found here something that you might find interesting:

This is great, thanks for the link!

Good point about power vs speed. Power is relative to body weight, and so is the amount of breaking friction a given rider can generate with the road. So it may be necessary to modulate power output to match rider in order to not overpower the foot drag effect on the rpm, making it undetectable. 
As far as road imperfections causing a spike, I think false positives aren't too big of a deal as long as they aren't frequent. All they triggers is free coasting of the motor. An extra kick is all you'd need to get going under power again.

Its possible this won't work, and require a break pad, but the only way to know is to try building it.

Thank you guys for ideas! Just implemented a simple version of remoteless control in the [Firefly Nano](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/firefly-nano-remote/72916/265?u=droidsector) receiver. Since VESC's built-in cruise control is used, the receiver will watch for a spike in motor current to return to coasting. I guess it's easier to catch because cruise control will try to keep the same rpm. 

After some testing, I've found that a safer way to produce that spike in current is to push/slide the board backward while standing on it with both feet. In other words, to send your upper body forward and legs backward. 

The activation is a bit different though, after pushing with a set speed (e.g > 12 km/h for 3 seconds) the cruise control will be activated when the speed drops below the same threshold (rider has stopped pushing). 

So overall it's not the true "endless ride" mode, it's more for emergencies (remote is broken or out of juice), but the code is very simple:

https://github.com/DroidSector/FireFly-Nano-Remote/blob/e3390a121d13bde45506a914bc7bd54b3da4adc9/src/receiver/receiver.cpp#L722
