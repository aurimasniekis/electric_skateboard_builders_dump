I had a small short with the BMS and one of the battery packs, the fuse immediately blew, however I'm not 100% positive my bms is good.

Is there a way I could check if the BMS is balancing the cells correctly? I have a 10s4p, if I check all 4packs in series and they all have the same increments of 4.2V on a full charged battery does it means the BMS is ok?

If they are all at 4.2v then you should be fine
