I am planning on building an 8S lipo battery with 5000mah and 25C. This will be two 4S 5000mah with 25C in series. That should be about 125A output. I am planning on attaching this BMS for both charge and discharge protection. [this bms](http://www.batterysupports.com/28v-29v-33v-45a-8x-36v-8s-lithium-ion-lipo-battery-bms-pcm-pcb-p-263.html) 

The BMS supports 45A continuous discharge but my ESC pulls 50A continuous. Will this be safe to use without too much overheating or problems? I live in a hilly area but I heard that a BMS can support 10% more amps than what it has described usually. Is this true?
