I was about to buy 2 x VESCs from Enertion but it seems they just sold out and I missed the boat.

Any recommendations on what's the best / most affordable place to buy them given that I'm in Australia?

Depends on your budget: 90-100â‚¬ go for a maytech or DIY (an esk8 shop).
If you want to double the budget, I believe it is worth waiting few weeks for vesc 6.

BTW I am selling a brand new vesc (maytech) so pm me if you are interested.

Send me a PM with your number. The Australian ESK8 group has a dude in it who can send you two I think.
