Did you run motor detection? Please post pictures of your build and VESC screenshots. It helps us help you.

I hate to say it, but that red flashing usually means the DRV chip is blown.

You may have had a short in your motor leads. It may surprise you (certainly surprised me), but plugging the bullet connectors in and not taping them individually can result in a short, as happened to one of my VESCs. It shared similar symptoms of sort of working for a little bit, then dying completely.

Depending on where you got it, you might be able to get it repaired for very low cost. Mine from Enertion has been repaired for free given that I payed for shipping. 

Best of luck!

Of course, some screenshots of settings would also help, as well as a picture of your hardware setup.

what battery are you using?
Your cutoff start and end are normaly too low.
Also that Error is due to overcurrent. Vesc max is 130A and youÂ´re getting almost 140A, so the vesc shuts down and maybe blow its DRV.
```

## \#13 Posted by: Alanhunt123 Posted at: 2017-06-20T12:11:52.049Z Reads: 124

Yup that error code most likely means the DRV is blown. Try testing the motor leads for shorts with a multimeter.

At first tell us what battery and motor you use?  Are you sure that you soldered all correctly? No cold joints. There is clearly something wrong in your set up if it blows drv that easy.

Your fucking kidding me, I just got a new vesc because the last blew. I think there is a problem with the motor that keeps blowing the drv

 I am no expert but I believe what the people who responded here are saying is that if there is a problem or short in the motor leads, or even the battery leads for that matter, it is what is blowing your the DRV. No matter how many new controllers you get until  The original problem is rectified you will continue to blow all of them. You might inquire as to getting the DRV replaced which might be cheaper than buying yet another controller. But before you plug anything else in you should go over all of your connections to find out what  is causing these failures. It seems like you're VESC is the victim of a problem that has not yet been found or rectified.  I suppose it could be your motor, I am not discounting that, but there are many other more likely suspects. Just my .02

Take several close up pictures of all your wires. motor esc battery etc. Then the community here will try to help. Without seeing the setup we will just be guessing which is not that helpful to you. 

I agree with @oldguy that we need to find the source of the issue.

Edit, also where are you located? So we can suggest someone for repairs.

I can't see anywhere in this thread that you answered the question:

What motor and battery are you using?

First step in fixing your rig is answering the questions. Or, just keep blowing DRV's
