Thinking about a diy hub motor. Which has more torque a 5065 motor or a 6355 motor. My guess is the 6355 but just wanted to check with someone more experienced

If the two motors are the same size (not like this case) then the kv alone pretty much dictates its torque output vs the other motor.
If they're not the same size, then chances are the bigger motor will have more torque unless for some odd reason its kv is significantly higher than the smaller one

That's what I thought but which is more important for torque the length of the motor or the diameter because they have almost the same dimensions just in opposite directions

Well it really comes down to the KV the most. Generally, the wider motor will give more torque. That is sort of a tough question, maybe someone else can chip in. If you are trying to decide I wouldn't stress it too much. How a motor performs is a lot more based on the entirety of your setup

Ok I would like to use the 5065 motor because it will give me the most urethane on my wheels but I'm not sure if it will have enough torque

What does the size of your motor have to do with the amount of urethane? Is this about ground clearance? If so, then yeah 50mm motors are a lot less bulky. If you gear it properly you should have enough, then again I need a lot more info on what sort of setup you have.

I am building a hub motor. So if the motor that is inside the wheels is too big I will only have a thin layer of urethane around the motor and it will be a rough ride

Hub motor? That changes everything. So both are 90kv? If that is the case, then by far the smaller 50mm takes the cake.

Ok thank you. That's what I was thinking about using I'm still just not sure if it will have enough torque

Anyone know if it will have enough torque?
