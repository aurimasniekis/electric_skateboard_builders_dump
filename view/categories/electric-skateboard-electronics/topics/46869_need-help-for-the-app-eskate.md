Did you set the baud rate?
The baud rate of the module has to match the settings in the Vesc and phone App.

Did you solder the leads yourself or did you buy it? Double Check that every pin is where it's supposed to be.

Is your phone actually connected to the tooth or just scanning it? I am trusting that the supplier got the pins right.

Look on the tool you used to setup the Vesc, make them match if you want the same control setting from your physical remote.

This is the optimized setting for space cells and the default setting for Vesc's. Plug them in and you should be fine.
