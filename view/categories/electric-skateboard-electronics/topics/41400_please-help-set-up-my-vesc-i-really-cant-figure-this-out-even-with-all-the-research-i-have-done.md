If you haven’t read this yet then it would be really helpful. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-vesc-user-read-this-complete-walktrough-of-the-vesc/2980

If you need help for more specific stuff about vesc settings I’m sure someone could help. I’ll help as much as I can but I’m still pretty new at this.

I'm sure a lot of people can help. But you're not saying what you need help for. Entering VESC settings ? Plugin it to your computer ? Running the VESC software ?
When asking for help, better be precise in what you need, rather than being super vague and not saying much...

Changed the lowercase "i's in the title to uppercase.

Have you installed bldc tool and plugged the Vesc in your computer

```
For beginners I would say motor max at 60 and batt max at 25, max erpm limit at 60k, check limit erpm with negative torque.
Min input voltage at 8v, max at 57, batt cutoff start at 22.2 batt cuttoff start at 22.1

Those are just some simple quick settings, ofc you should understand what each one does and play around with them if you want to

Please read the thread that @kyletrainy posted

And be sure turn off your board if you ever want to unplug the phase wires, and tape the phase wires if you ride, if they get shorted you'll blow a drv
