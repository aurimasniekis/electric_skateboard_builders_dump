I've received the wireless remote and now need to connect it to VESC....looking for details on the 3 pin connectors so I can order a connector (size/type would be helpful).  

I know that there are standard connectors, just need to know which one to order.

I believe its called servo connector as its mainly used for servo motors. You could also use wire and solder them.

It's called a male to male JR plug servo extension.
Any rc hobby shop should have them.
Otherwise ebay or hobbyking.
