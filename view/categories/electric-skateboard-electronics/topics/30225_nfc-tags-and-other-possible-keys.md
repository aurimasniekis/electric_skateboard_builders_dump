At the moment I just have a switch on my board to turn it on/off. For my current build I'd love to include a NFC tag or something similar for it be used, in addition the turning it on. 

I know there's loop keys etc but I'd like to avoid any keys of that sort.

On a similar note - have anyone installed something like [this on their board?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeStrH-5Llo)
