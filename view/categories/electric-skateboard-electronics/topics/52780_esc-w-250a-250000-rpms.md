While looking through some pages i found a nice ESC that maybe suits some builds of members here... calling @MoeStooge for the next generation raceboard haha

It is called the MGM ESC TMM 25063-3 X2–SERIES | 360A | 

* Max. peak current (5 Sek.):  360 A
* Max. continuous current (for full throttle): 250 A
* Operating voltage: 12 - 63 V
* Weight without power conductors: 300g
* Servocable cross-section: 0,25qmm
* Length of the servocable: 190mm
* Max RPMs: 250.000
* Number of regulation steps: 2048
* Motor PWM frequency: 8 - 32 kHz 
* On-state switch (FETs) resistance at 25 °C: 2 × 0.8 mW 
* Available BEC / OPTO versions: Opto

Still, don't know about brakes or anything.. maybe someone with a lot of moniez test one

mgm looks great, I have a mate who has a pair... throttled from the factory though... castle beats mgm :checkered_flag:

none of the rc high speed pass records are on mgm? I don't get

looks murderous.. jeez  in running 12s dual vesc6 w 6kw 80mm... its plenty scary and will either do a burnout, or accelerate your face into the pavement if you floor it from a stop....

couldn't imagine putting another 50 or 100A each into the motors... instant enlightenment?
