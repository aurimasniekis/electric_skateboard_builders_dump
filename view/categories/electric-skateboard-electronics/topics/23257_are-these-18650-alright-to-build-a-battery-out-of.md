Saw this on Ebay:

Would 2 of these setup as 10s4p work?  Or are these no where near as good as 25r's?

Thanks.....

It's a good deal on some genuine cells but the discharge rating is not high enough for use in a 10S4P battery. Max rating is 10A per cell and  at that current voltage sag is significant. The cells don't look like they are tracking well either which means a greater likelihood of cell drift. 

Unless you were going with a 6P battery more I wouldn't recommend them, the cheapest cell to use imo is the 25R.

The minimum I'd recommend for continuous battery discharge is 80A, though the higher the better.

wow that is really cheap!!

looks like an old hoverboard battery with the heatshrink removed, still really cheap!

it depends what you are building, but for sure not for a high power custom.
