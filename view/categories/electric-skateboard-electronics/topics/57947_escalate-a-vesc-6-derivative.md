Hi guys,
this winter I had some free time so I decided to start learning about electronics, even though what I am studying (mechanical engineering) doesn't formally require it.

I thought that starting with something interesting would help me learn faster; so I downloaded altium and I slowly built libraries, schematics and pcb layout of VESC 6.4 .

The whole process, expecially the library production, took quite some time to accomplish; for this reason I thought it would be nice to share my work with the experienced guys, which don't need to learn the basics.

_Open hardware but..._ 
To respect Ben Vedder decision about not sharing the gerbers -with the goal of keeping the project in the hands of experienced guys to avoid poor quality vescs- these are the conditions to get the files :
1) you have electronics experience and  have some open-source contribution records
2) if you plan to sell the hardware you agree to donate a fixed % to Vedder

The documentation that I will share includes everything: gerbers, schematics, libraries, pcb source files and enclosure 3d model (in the works..). 

Example of people who can ask for the files are : @jtag , @solidgeek , @Ackmaniac ...

About the name:
if the name doesn't sound good in english, please PM me a better one!

About the hardware:
1) as you can see the tallest components have been routed as far as possible from the fets; the reason is to keep  more mass close to the mosfets

2) connectors are still JST PH 2.0, just a surface mount type. I used the industry standard 1.5mm pitch for the SENSOR connector, so no more adapters are needed; the PPM connector has been substituited with a more convenient solder pad (so the wire can be presoldered at the fab)

3) dimensions are 61.5 x 59.1 mm

4) since directfets seem always out of stock, I will make a second version of this pcb with 4 [ntmfs5c604](https://datasheet.octopart.com/NTMFS5C604NLT1G-ON-Semiconductor-datasheet-33954820.pdf) per gate providing about half of the 2 directfet RDSon

5) a fancy ic-based anti-spark switch is being developed and will be opensource without restrictions. It will include some features like e-fuse, transitient voltage suppression, overvoltage and overcurrent protection

Since I enjoy disruption in general, it would be rich irony to use the name -

ESCapade

Looks cool Bro? well done congrats :+1:

While I am not after any files or plan on building a ESC of my own... generation 4.xx VESC all files were released. I think it was a strategic move by Vedder (who has done the community some amazing work, albeit opensource so with the help of others) & Co to slow things down on this release so they could build their TM and make sales un-apposed.
& while I applaud your sentiment of returning some profits to Vedder acting like a gate keapper and refusing to share anything unless there is payment kind of goes against something being open source... it is more open commerce.
We really are at the beginning of this HW.6X journey. From a advanced development perspective for the real development to happen the cash cow that is the VESC 6 needs to be killed. As long as there is such price disparity products will only compete on price. Once some of that margin is taken away (like back to the price Trampa sell a VESC 6 with a complete) then the real innovation from people like your self will happen bro. HW.6X will then begin competing for features, or lack of features so that the product suits the market.

This is the basic premise of innovation and disruption. While you have learnt some mad skills quickly you are now stalling to tread water where you could be contributing to a incremental evolution of the product or better still disrupting the market and changing the game.

All that said I think downloading bldc tool from Vedder and donating for it is a great idea and of course you should follow all requirements for the opensource hardware software as laid down in the GPL.

finally...

[/quote]

As Jaxxy mentioned the two big caps will break their own legs from their weight/vibration in use, i'd silicone them in place in the enclosure with a neutral cure silicone (hot glue can work, but it also gets soft when it gets hot). You could make a mold and insert a couple of pre-molded silicone pads so they can be removed for service, but not really required.

Anyway good luck again dude, knock a couple of those badboys out and give them to a beast in the community and see if they hold up as good as a VESC.6

PCB update: I re-routed a shunt amplifier closer to the shunt resistor to minimize EMI on the sense traces.

![new%20layout|637x500](upload://4Bd1fM1VBrFDDZ1IbYRB5fhDyfw.PNG)

Case update: I sketched up this case. I had as priorities: 
1)cnc cost: the whole case can be routed with 0 tool changes. Only 4mm bit is required.
2)the smaller the better (65 x 62mm)
3)pcb should't be in contact with metal to avoid vibration transfer. I obtained this by using 2 o-rings on the 2 lateral supports. The 3rd support is already substained by the heat transfer pad, which already acts as vibration dampening.

Wow, that looks amazing, I've tried PCB design before, and it was just a complete mess trying to arrange and route the smd resistors Dx.
If you have any more stock issues, I would also like the recommend using the TPW1R306PL,L1Q from Toshiba Semiconductor, it has similar electrical characteristics (RDSon and switching charge) to the ON Semi NTMFS5C604NL, but is cheaper and features double sided cooling.  (Honestly, I'd avoid anything from International Rectifier brand in this performance range; their transistors are expensive and inferior to similarly priced competitors on the market.)
Which current shunt amps are you using? I just wanted to let you know that the INA240 from Texas Instruments offers superior electrical characteristics and pricing compared to the ones from Analog Devices that are used on the VESC 6. 
If you don't already, I would highly recommend RC snubbers on all the switch nodes for the DRV8301; I've seen way too many DRV chips die on my friends' VESCs and it's really saddening since many of them aren't able to replace the chips themselves as it is very difficult to replace.

I like how you did the case! I would however not design it so it can be done with 4mm all the way. I made a video of my first set of vesc6 cases and it had 9 tool changes i think but that was including drilling and tapping M3 and M4 in the same operation. Itâ€™s way more efficient to remove material with a bigger endmill/rougher :D 

The 3 fixing spots to the enclosure is the way to go. The Escape is only fixed with two M3 over at the fets so there is a lot of strain on the board if the case isnâ€™t filled with silicone around some sweetspots. 

If you need milling of the enclosure Iâ€™ll do it for material cost+shipping for a good cause :) Iâ€™m not an expert at this so tolerances wonâ€™t be aerospace like but should be decent for a case.

So many tips in one post, thanks! much appreciated. While choosing the bom I think is wise to beware of China market stock. By this logic the NTMFS5C series is a champion, basically any chinese resaller has them both fake and original. I was thinking about going with the -612 (dual) offering a combined rdson of 0.75 mohm, less gate charge of a directfet and an average price of 0.6eu each (China market) for the originals.
I like the double cooling of the toshiba though so I will look into that, as well as the shunt ic.

I was meaning that smallest radious is 4mm so it is possible, not mandatory, to do 0 tool changes :slight_smile: . Your offer is very generous; I would feel bad though about outsourcing the big batch for real production after your favor-- and unfortunately outsourcing is almost mandatory to keep costs low and logistics simple. How about if on top of materials+shipping I send you 10 unpopulated pcbs? Thanks for the #cncporn btw.

Hi @fedestanco,
Is there any room for another connector ? I'd love to have access to more STM32 spare IO.
I stuck into coding my custom VESC FW integrating mode because no spare IO for interacting with it.
Using Rx/Tx (as coded in the official FW) isn't a way to go as everybody wants BLE now.

Also, to reduce cost of the case, why don't you machine only the bottom and then machine POM walls ?
Less material, less machining, less cost. ;)

I wrote a firmware that embeds simple mode, compatible with any app (not only ppm).
I collected a LOT of feedbacks from different users (from electric skates, scooters or bike users) about this lack of mode switching just by pushing a button (and not using a smartphone with all known connectivity issues)
In the current firmware, the only way to use digital input is to use :
- Rx/Tx if not in "whatever + UART" app (= impossible to use bluetooth or other UART third-party devices)
- PPM input in ADC mode

Those digital inputs are already used for cruise control or reverse purpose.
The only trick I could do today is to re-program unused ADC3 as a DI on HW6.4. :neutral_face:
This is why having a couple of other DI could a a really good improvement for enhancing the use of VESC in so many applications. :slight_smile:

Yes, there is quite some real estate on the bottom side, where the logo is. The purpose of this free space is to solder an FCC certified nrf module, so that even US people can use this feature. 
https://it.aliexpress.com/item/4pcs-Pack-NRF24L01-Chip-Module-RF2401F20-with-FCC-Certification/32335219778.html

Thanks to @linsus' hint I re-routed -again- the 3rd shunt amplifier. BTW I still don't understand well why a PWM signal is more susceptible to EMI than the current sense traces. I thought it was the opposite.

I also made a first draft of the BOM, trying to max out the components specs. 
Octopart says that the best 680uf 63v cap is EEUFR1J681L (21mohm, 10 000h life, 2.8A ripple). But @Blasto claims [focbox caps are 20mohm](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/sesc-a-vesc-6-derivative/58106/76?u=fedestanco); maybe a typo?

I feel like once you have some of your esc out with some real world testing maybe start looking at doing something for a dual drive all in one system because so many people here have the dual setup.  I wish I could lend my knowledge but I do not have much knowledge in the electrical field, If this was the analytical field then I would be able to help.

I dont remember correctly now but I think if RF module is pre-verified by FCC you don't need to verify whole product as long that module is fixed to your hardware and follows requirements or something like that...

Sounds very unlikly to me. FCC is way more strict then the EMC directives we have in the EU. And here you have to do sevral certifications, EN55xx is just for anything electrical. Addin a radio on it adds sevral other certifications if a commercialy available Product. I love the idea that the manufacturer could promise that, but feels bit farfetched.

Thanks for the link. 1-2k is doable. But you must have a very solid and tested design before submitting the request, and it could take a while.

My backup plan to skip stupid legal stuff was to manufacture, instead of the "cover pcb", a 2mm plexiglass cover (which BTW looks much cooler since you can see the interiors) and have the module siliconed to it. This way you don't have to obtain a new certification since you didn't technically create an "rf pcb" but just a support for the module.
The connection to the vesc below this plexiglass can be made by a simple I/O cable.

Well... it is really a in between product, it is more than just a beefup 4,12, since the heart of the 4.12 was mostly the drv8302. The unity is base upon the DRV8301 like the Vesc6, But I do agree it a bit confusing, since it is not a Vesc6 or neither a vesc 4.12, is it a complete different implementation of the same family of components.

Hi @fedestanco ! I digged into building PCB as well, but with Kicad (would love to stick to Open Source spirit, hope I took the right way though).
About building the library, were you in the need to download each component's CAD, one by one ?

Sure, Altium and Kicad are not the same, but wondering if this process is the same though.

Hi @EnderWiggin ,as I explained you in PM these are the only requirements to get on board. 

@Pimousse I tried to find as much as possible pre made footprints and 3d models already made online. Snapeda is the best source. To design footprints yourself I suggest to use a 3D editor like fusion360 and then import them as dwg. In fact I found the built in footprint designer too oversimplified. 
Btw if you tell me the library format of kikad I can try to convert everything a send the files to you.

Kicad uses *.lib (symbols) and *.mod (footprints) files.

Any chance I can jump into your A-team ? :smiley:

No kidding @linsus  ðŸ˜‰ Want to test them out first, haven't asked for the files since I know he won't give them to just anyone and don't think he will without seeing they are build properly and get some valid feedback first.

Was initially going let my friend have a look at the schematic for the VESC 6 and see if he would be interested in doing the layout, but no need if someone else already seems to have done a great job with that.

Depends abit on your level of knowledge. If you truly wish to get a grasp, the fundamentals of electronics are on the heavy side, mathematic wise, it could easly feel overwhelming. So its really hard to recommend some literature without discouraging people xD.

What exactly is it that you want to learn? PCB schematic and layout? Cause the practical use of the CADtools is like MSpaint for grownups, quite easy to learn. If you want to be able to understand and design off your head I'm afraid there are no shortcuts tho. 

I know one book thats pretty good, i cant remember its name tho, Will try find it. Its in english as well. probably what you prefer :smiley:

Edit: "electrical engineering, principles and applications" by Allan R. Hambley is a good one.
Its a monster of a book. But it covers alot.

Depends what you mean, the official controller is the VESC over at trampaboards. You can buy em right away if you please. They're in the "high end" cost and quality wise tho so many are reluctant to spend thier hard earned money. I've yet to see anyone dissapointed however. 

The new VESCs are trampa VESCs. Not derivatives.
