So when I first made my board I didn't put much thought into the wiring so it ended up pretty messy but I want to go back and make this splicing better. What kind of wire do I need to solder to these balancing wires so that i can extend the length? <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5119017c6e0fc1d1782f5c7acbe1c3bce4c6f2ba.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Just buy extenders. I don't even bother soldering all those small wires sometimes. Just buy a 6 inch jst balance extender. Amazon or eBay
