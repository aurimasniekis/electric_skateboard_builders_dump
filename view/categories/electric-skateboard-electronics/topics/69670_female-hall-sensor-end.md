I seen an earlier thread on Hall sensor wire extension cables, and the general conclusion was to just solder the wires longer. I already have the mini to VESC Cords, So i'd like to replaces the mini ends with a regular female plug. Anyone know where I can find these?

Where are you based? These guys do a good range of stuff from Germany.
Here's the link to the convertors. Not what you're looking for but might save time and money in the long run?

Yes, that's exactly what I am looking for. Thank you. I thought he meant the adapter cables.
