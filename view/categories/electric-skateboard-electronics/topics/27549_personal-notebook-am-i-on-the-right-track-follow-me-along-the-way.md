Hi Guyes, 
this forum is giving me so much great info, thanks. :heart_eyes:
So, I'm as one of the many, an all time electronic noop that took a project building a skateboard,
Made this topic along with my notebook as I'm learning more and more of this world so you guyes can now follow along and look where I am going. :runner: 
This topic will be updated daily as I'm learning and by my self and you guyes :mortar_board:

Thank you for taking a look and following me along!




:tulip:**MY DESIRE** :tulip:

Top speed would be around :rocket:  **20-25 mp/h (32-40 km/h)** :rocket: 

A great moderate acceleration/torque for when going from red to green light along bikes and cars.
With that torque I want my skateboard to go without needing to push off the gound. 
But I'm not going to ride the San Francisco streets, most of the streets I'm at in the city is flat as a pancake with two or three hills with a 10-15% rise.
_Maybe too long explanation about my desired torque, but I hope it makes sense_ :sweat_smile:

The range should be 10-15 km (6-10 miles) 


The wheel size would be **83mm** the lowest diameter in the recomended 80-90mm for having the quickest acceleration. :rocket: 

The wheel and motor pulley that fits would be these

**Motor mount**
I found this TorqueBoards v4 Bolt On Motor Mount that fits most motors in 63mm and 50mm of diameter.

:motorcycle:  **MOTOR** :motorcycle: 
I'm joggeling with a lot of motors in my mind, I have a link to them followed by a thought.

_KV is the number of rotation of the motor per voltage applied. Usually the higher the KV the faster the motor, and the lower the KV the more torque it can produce._

_There is such a small difference in the motor and i should just make a quick choice_

I' have no pack solution but have read that SAMSUNG 30q cells from [ru.nkon.nl](https://ru.nkon.nl/catalogsearch/result/?q=Samsung+30Q) but witch one and how many is a myth for me.
If I knew how many Li-ions I sould get to have the same as my Lipo battery suggestions above. For a longer use of battery and the safty of not having Lipo battery explode.
Or find a good battery pack with a battery management system (BMS)

:robot:  **VESC** :robot:

Is it all too much info in one topic?, this is my first post, let my know how I can make this better.
This is again just a way for me to get an overview.
Feel free to comment 



 :pencil:  **EXTRA NOTES** :pencil: 

:gear:  **Gear ratio**

A gear ratio of 2:1 means (motor rotation:wheel rotation)

As in every time the motor has made 2 turns, the wheel has made one turn.

:motorcycle:  **Motor**
 [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-190kv Brushless Outrunner Motor](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-190kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) 

**SK3** is just the brand

**6364** is masuremenets of the motor (63mm x 64mm) 

**190kv** means **RPMS** (Rotations per minute) per volt 

**T18** is mentiont in lower in the description of[ the motors site](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-190kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) same link as above.
what T18 gives you is the lower the T number is the higher the **RPM** you can expect from the motor

**P14** is poles (magnets) insode the motor


See you !
じゃあね！

[/quote]
A few rules to help you understand the electro part
Ohm's law: V [volt] = R [resistance] * I [ampere]. 
Power: P [watt] = V [volt] * I [ampere]
Ah = 1000 mAh. m in this sense is milli - milli Ampere hour.

Examples:
If you have a 10s4p battery you may have (depending on batterytype) 36V * 12Ah = 432 Wh power.

Some more rules/basic electro:
Putting two power sources in parallell: two 3.6V 3Ah batteries results in a 3.6V and 6Ah batterypack.

Putting two power sources in series: two 3.6V 3Ah batteries results in a 7.2V and 3Ah batterypack.

Hence a 10 in series and 4 in parallell batterypack with 3.6V and 3 Ah batteries is 3.6V * 10 = 36V and 4 * 3Ah = 12 Ah.

In general are LiIon batteries safer than LiPo batteries. Are you planning on building the batterypack your self? You can buy a complete pack with a BMS from one of the DIY-vendors. In Europe you can look at, among others, Unik Boards and esk8.de.

There are many different setups. You need to figure out what suits your final configuration. Try the esk8 calculator to learn some of the parameters: http://calc.esk8.it

Referring to the examples in the last post, you will need 40 LiIons 18650 batteries for a 10s4p batterypack.

What is ment by the Efficiency?

```
Your esk8 system is not ideal. In other words, you do not get all the power from the battery directly in to moving you forward. There are several matters that makes a system less than 100% efficient: different friction in e.g. belts and bearings. In addition there are efficiency losses in the electronics.

What exactly the efficiency rate is I cannot answer as I have no numbers to back me up. I can say that it is less than a 100%, for sure. Maybe someone else can add some efficiency numbers from experince?

I would say leave it at 85 or 90and it should be good

Also, check one.more calc, it.is good for battery / range estimate (though some extra room for battery life would be advised)

http://calc.esk8.today

By the way - nice write up of text / description of build plan, very easy to read!

As about the motors, i would suggest to go through calc a few times, over 200kv for 6s might be recommended, unless u gear.for speed. Going with lower like 190kv, is probably a good.idea if u plan to improve / increase.voltage of.your battery in the future

```
Well, if u want more than 30kph speed with 83mm wheels, 6s (22.2v) battery volts and, 2,4 : 1 gear ratio, then you need at least 245kv motor.

I think 2 : 1 gear ratio is possible, but then you would still need at least 236kv motor i think.

Some people who want higher speed with 6s, might even choose 270kv motors

-- update --

As you gonna use vesc, go at least with 8 - 10s from beginning, speed will be higher, u will also probably get more torque, as your gearing can be higher (not so much aimed for.speed, as motor will spin fast enough anyways because of extra voltage)

Then with 8s or 10s you can easily go with around 200kv motor and you shouldnt have problems

The only headache u will have is.how.to.charge.batteries, unless u install bms and charge in "bulk.mode" but drawback to.this is  not seeing what is going inside of cells.while.charging

are you talking about the wheels sould be 85 or 90?

No, the efficiency. Though some others might recommend 80 percent but for me 85 - 90 was more believable / precise
