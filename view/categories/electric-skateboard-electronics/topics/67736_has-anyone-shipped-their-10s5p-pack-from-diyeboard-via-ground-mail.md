Hey, im wondering if anyone has sent their battery anywhere in the states before... im trying to send my battery to @J0ker3366 but today they said I need a special number(the U/N number? I cant remember exactly what the two letters were :x) from the manufacturer to ship it.... Any ideas >-<

Ive already contacted diyeboard but I feel like its either going to be misunderstood or no answered in a timely fashion

is this avoidable entirely? when i get out of my class im going to call another packaging company who might be able to package my "dangerous goods" as fedex called it

I have never had any issues sending my board with the battery UPS ground, within the united states. Just put one of these on the box with your phone number:

One of the large $18 flat rate boxes and lots of padding. Would think that's enough.

You can get USPS to drop off a flat rate box at your house for you and pick it up the next day.

They always ask me if there's anything hazardous or fragile and I say yes but they never ask which one it is
