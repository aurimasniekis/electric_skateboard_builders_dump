Had the switch on my Dual FSESC4.20 Plus fail within a couple weeks of purchasing it(stopped latching). 
Replaced it and everything worked fine for a week.

Now its started powering on as soon as I plug in the battery regardless of switch position. 
Checked the switch with a multimeter and it seems to be behaving normally. 
I'm assuming this means the onboard antispark has failed?

Can I bin the switch and just use an xt90s loopkey? Flipsky says not to power on the vesc without having the switch installed but as the switch pins no longer seem to do anything I'm thinking it doesn't matter at this point?

Yes that you can do. The antispark on Flipsky isnt always reliable.

They say that because it kills the switch. No problem if it's dead already.
