Master Focbox on Raptor 2 is flashing red and nothing happens when pushing throttle forward.
No fault codes in bldc tool and both motor spin during motor detection. What could be wrong?

In the ppm tab, you have ‚Äúcurrent no reverse with brake‚Äù ticked?

No, it was on disabled. Odd as i've used the board after changing settings. Vesc still flashlng red, is it supposed to do that? But wheels spin when changing to current no reverse.

Let me guess, you clicked "Load defaults" in the bldc tool...

And now
-app configuration is probably set to No App
-ppm tab probably is set to disabled, instead of "Current no reverse"
-your motor detection is probably invalid

You need to reconfigure the VESC from scratch. Follow a VESC setup guide, as it sounds like nothing is wrong other then you loaded defaults thinking it would fix your messing with settings.. lol
