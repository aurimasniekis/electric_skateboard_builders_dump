With all of the current market products out there for each of the different esk8 boards, what are people building themselves to account for the lack of (in my opinion) a fully featured remote. I have been looking around for a couple of different threads that showed people working with OLED displays creating menus, cruise controls, different levels of difficulty. The problem is most of these had no conclusion. This made me curious what different people are working on, or use for their esk8 that they had made, or that another member of this community had created.

I personally have the Nano-X controller from Enertion. It works well.
