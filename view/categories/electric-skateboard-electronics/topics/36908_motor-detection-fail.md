you could send it to be repaired by @JohnnyMeduse or you could sell it as parts and upgrade to a more reliable FocBox (from @evoheyax or @longhairedboy if you are in the states)  , or if you have the money to spend get a VESC 6 from @trampa

Pm @JohnnyMeduse and get a quote, or search VESC repair because there may be others closer to you that could.

Johnny is located in canada, if you ship it to him, expect to pay 15$ for shipping to him, and about 3-4 weeks before you get it back. It'll also cost around 40$. 

On the other hand, you could just sell the broken vesc for 50$ on the forum and get a focbox.
