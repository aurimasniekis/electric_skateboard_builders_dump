So a bit ago I went ahead and purchased a couple 10s4p all in one, built in bms/meter plug and play battery from a member of this forum. I am now thinking of building up a board or two but the safety of the battery and it not going up in flames are of utmost importance.

 I have taken of the "fancy" carbon fiber sticky tape and a bit of the backing so that I can get the opinion of some more experienced builders here on the forum as to how I can clean up/ seal up this power house for my future builds.
@longhairedboy, @okp and other trusted members any glaring problems you see with this battery.

I am especially concerned about the  side edges, specifically where some of the pointed balance lead beads appear to be digging into the positive out lead. Ideas on how to insulate those?

Also this beast measures 50cm long x 13.25 cm wide and 2.75 cm tall............
What size heat shrink will cover it? I'm thinking clear if I can find it.

I really didn't feel comfortable with the tape the make used.

Never seen the cell blocks used in a pack before don‚Äôt see the need if he spot welded them..did he do two layers of nickel? 220mm pvc heat shrink I got on eBay should work it shrinks way down. Have a set 2 4p packs I put beside each other and it shrinks them not a bother.
This man knows his batteries tho.. @scepterr

Minimum 180mm width
If that's a single layer on the series link I would definitely add more nickel or solder some 12/10awg

It's a double layer of nickel.

It looks a bit skinny and thin so it wouldn't hurt to beef it up. 
Also, is this attached to the cell or loose

No soldered to nickel ![15158448236731921185669|666x500](upload://d5Hqmxuxi2uyWUUqs3zMg8gWrqO.jpg)

I'm going over the outside balance leads with two layers of 3m 1500 Teflex to insulate from rub wear.

No, the welds looked good to me and two layers which is also good. This isn't that I'm worried because of the quality or anything just sort of due diligence and wanted to heat shrink these puppies. Thought to get some outside opinions.

If you are worried about the main positive lead being punctured add some fishpaper aka fibrous insulation paper and possibly use some silicone to fix it in place.  Use a neutral cure silicon as it won't off-gas acid which will attack metal components.

you need to look for "neutral cure" - I have found some black stuff that is designed for potting electronics, trouble is it has a silly long cure time so I wouldn't recommend that unless you are cool with letting it cure for about 5 days.

if you look at the 2nd pic down I had the same potential issue, so I ran a layer of silicone + fishpaper between the insulated cable and the nickel/cable and then another layer of fishpaper over the top of that.

Personally I think you're over worrying about something happening to this pack.
That foam board just seems way overkill in my opinion, or are you not planning to put this in an enclosure?

If you are, then just some 1mm neoprene sheet and 180mm shrink wrap is totally sufficient.

Naw it's going in an enclosure.....the foam serves to hold the cell holders together and the BMS/charge plug/ switch on the front of the battery.

Had a few other batteries that I had built pop fizzle crack on me and think it in nerved me. I just watched a few videos online of cells going to failure and thought about my small apt and what if scenerios. Just want to make sure all's good with the battery.

Hmmm....

There's a lot of scaremongering going around about these batteries, they're really not as dangerous as people think unless you abuse them :confused:

Some 1mm foam board of you insist on it and just heat shrink will be totally sufficient....

Here's what I think. 
You obviously have a spot welder. Why don't you weld smaller tabs of nickle on for balance leads? Soldering onto the nickle strip over the negative end of the cells is no big deal. They wont short out. But soldering the nickel strip over the positive end of the cells is a bad idea. You could be damaging the casing and asking for a short if/when that pack flexes.

```
only things i can see here that i might do it to go back with an iron and smooth any solder spikes away. Along edges like that what i've started doing is using heavy vinyl tape to separate the balance leads from the nickel all the way down, then i like to bundle the whole edge in a nice 2" strip of black tape before heat shrinking, which allows you to lay the wires out safely away from any potential shorts before they are bound inside the pack. 

TL;DR: smooth and rounded solder joints, tape over the nickel before running balance leads down then, tape the balance lead runs before heat shrinking to keep them bundled properly away from any potential shorts.
