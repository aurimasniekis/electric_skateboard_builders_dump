Hey guys so I'm coming around to building version 3 of my board and I am going the dual motor route. I have used the VESC for my last 2 version and was wondering if the Focbox is better than the vesc. I've got some money saved and this is the last part I need to order.  I'm gonna be running the esc with a 10s6p battery and 2 6355 180kv motor. Thanks for the input

amps, so you have a rough estimate. when you go dual it will go down sure, but if you are heavy,hot climate and hilly area you can run easily into heat issues with normal 4.12 vesc.

Max 40 amps

I don't know where to find that. My current vesc isnt operable. That's partly why I'm upgrading again. My current vesc got damaged in transport through a carrier on my fully built board

well focbox without a doubt bette, it can handle the heat better hence more continuous amps than the regular vesc

Not only the increase in amps, but also far more reliable as it uses upgraded directFets :grinning:

Just incase you didn't know, a FOCBOX is a VESC.

That's not possible to answer since a FOCBOX is a VESC (in other words just a VESC can't be better than just a VESC).

However there are so many different VESC's!! The 4.12 ranging from $70 to $150 (including the FOCBOX), there are also VESC 6 which range from $150 to $300...

You can find a cheaper VESC that will serve you for years if used right. And you can buy the most expensive high quality VESC and fry it the first day.

FOCBOX is currently the mainstrean ESC if that answers your question.

Check out the Flipsky VESC 6, it's price is close to  one of FOXBOX, and seems to be of good quality (more or less) so far.

How does it compare to focbox? 
I'm super new to all this, and the specs are honestly just numbers to me. 
I'm cool with spending a bit more on a more reliable quality part.

*lol but then again a bought one of those cnc focbox heatsink case

i bet the flipsky 6 is better.  i dont know what parts need to be upgraded to stop breaking but im looking too.  a big heatsink that allows you to do many more amps is wasted when a chip blows up from something seemingly unrelated to high current

i dont trust the focbox warranty, if they even claim to have one.  know them too well.  i think the flipsky has a warranty.  maybe one more real than others.  less fine print that says if you touch it or plug it in yourself it's void.  but the escs deigned and sold by members here are maybe the best

car escs maybe last and are the safest bet for durability or maybe the vesc on bldc program will last too.  I only ever want to use foc though.

BUMP!

Any thoughts still? Focbox or Flipsky?

Still hung on the fence on this very topic. Ordered a cheap DIYE for my old board, but going all out on the Hummie Deck.

Car ESC? I still have a dual car Alien Car 12s from 5? years ago that im sure works, but cant program till I find an older PC. The software won't read any COM port other than COM1 on my win 10, and bad things will happen if I circumnavigate that haha.

Flipsky is half the price and I really don't wanna try to find the reason. Go with focbox, way nicer done, has aluminum heatsink, nothing sticking out ready to be broken... Enertion is here for you 24/7, nothing against fipsky... I would go (I am going with 2) focboxes
