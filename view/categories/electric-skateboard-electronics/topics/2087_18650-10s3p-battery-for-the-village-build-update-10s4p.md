I've got 30 18650 cells on the way thanks to our organized group-buy. Big ups to everyone who joined, and to @JLabs for organizing the buy!

I'm going to make a 10s3p pack. This will give me 7500mah at 10s, increasing the range of my current build by 50%, and I'll have a plug-and-play charging solution, so I'll be able to ride longer and more often. [Here's my original build thread][1]

I'm curious to see whether I'll notice much of a bump in power going from 8s to 10s. Acceleration is already very good on this build!

Here's a parts list:

You can find them in my shop on esk8.de in the electronics section. It contains a 40a replaceable fuse, but you could add any other fuse as well and the connector for the fuse is very tight, so no danger of loosing it due to vibrations. I'm manufacturing them here locally.

I know it's not the cheapest solution especially compared with DiY anti spark XT90, but that's based on my local manufacturing costs (German labor is rather expensive) and 2 years warranty I have to provide. 

Shipment to US is 12.50â‚¬ and should take around 5 working days.

I'm considering this option for a battery charger, although only charges at 2A it's also smaller and lighter (and reduces the build cost by $25 or so).

Super easy I got the idea from someone on this forum but I forgot who so thanks to whoever that was. I'll link what you need.

XSCORPION (CB100) 100 Amp Circuit Breaker with Manual Reset https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MR1LVVC/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awd_UoDaxbSR6VWNG

Shuts your main power off so you don't even need to unplug you battery. I used it on 6s for months and it's fine.  I have a pretty beefy soldering iron so I can solder the 10 gauge wire to the screw posts. You could use the included nuts but I wasn't sure how those would fair with vibrations

Be sure to specify a high overcurrent protection. They can probably take that unit up to 80 or 90 amps.

Thanks @chaka 

We are having some confusion about selecting a BMS for 10S3P vs 10S4P.... what about the BMS or the charger should be adjusted for the number of parallel groups? It's unclear to me whether the charger or the BMS is responsible for cutting off power once the desired voltage has been reached. What are the considerations for a BMS as you add parallel groups to a battery pack?

You guys are doing a group buy so I wouldn't make things too complicated. Get the most robust bms you can get your hands on and build a min of 10s4p with 20 amp cells. Use the bms for its low voltage cutoff and balancing functions. The max continuous discharge and peak discharge values just show what the bms is capable of without failing. 

Cells rated for 20 amps are not going to magically output 40 amps. They may peak for a second or two but voltage will sag pretty hard throwing the low voltage cutoff. The max current cutoff on a bms is to protect the bms not the pack. So you can see budget and bms dimensions are your only limiting factors. 

Charging li-ion cells: Divide the packs watt hours by a factor of 2 and find a charger that matches that number. You don't want to charge faster than 0.5C

You guys should do a group buy at green bike: [http://www.greenbikekit.com/battery-charger.html][1] Pick your wattage, voltage and connector style and they do the rest. Shipping starts around $45 so you need to buy more than one to see any savings.

Avoiding an imminent [hijack of @longhairedboy's build thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lhb-scarlet-black-metal-edition-12s-430-wh-18650-w-bms-ollin-vescs-enertion-dual-190kv-6355-83mm-flywheeel-clones/2475/65), I'm bringing the question of nickel strip selection here. The question is simple, which size and thickness of pure nickel to we need in a 3p or 4p configuration with 18650 cells?

@eLDoska shared that: 

[quote="eLDoska, post:69, topic:2475, full:true"]
About nickel strips:5mm x 0,127mm -  6A5mm x 0,15mm - 7-8A6mm x 0,2mm - 11A8mm x 0,2mm - 15A10mm x 0,2mm - 18A
[/quote]
 
so for a 3p unit with 3.7 nominal voltage and 20A discharge, which strip is optimal? Starting to think I should just use copper wire throughout.

@chaka @torqueboards @onloop @elkick @sl33py calling you guys in for reinforcements here - any thoughts on the right selection of nickel strips?

@treenutter Thanks for doing this. I feel like those numbers were a little low considering what i've seen inside of actual packs. If i come away feeling like i have to triple layer my 8mm strips, i'll do it, but i'm not convinced i need to yet. 

I didn't buy a spot welder so i could solder 10awg wire down the sides of my packs. I have over 50 feet of wire and a good iron, but that's not the point.

If you use black battery spacers 3x1 you need 8mm strips because in most spacers the spaice in the middle is 8mm. With basic motors with 60-70A max, each pack must hold 60-70A - 23A/cell in 3P and 17.5A/cell  in 4P. So you need connection between cells that can hold 23A max. And it could be 2 layers of 8mm x 02mm strip (2x15A = 30Amax).

@lunarswift it depends on the battery setup you've got. If you're using a BMS that comes with switching capabilities, then you just need a small switch to toggle it on and off. The BMS I'm using in this build has this feature, so my switch is just a simple rocker switch. If you're connecting lipos directly to your switch, then yes, you need one that can handle the amps you'd pull. That's why the 120amp breaker works, same for Vedder's anit-spark switch with a fuse works.

Not to step on anyone's toes or anything but after much consideration ai've elected to go with a flat braided product like this. I find comfort in the flexibility that the braid provides over the rigid strips that might be susceptible to shock force failure. But that's just me.

Are you going to solder those right to the 18650s? Those look pretty stout. How many amps are they rated for? I was Planning on reinforcing the serial connections with buss wire to carry more juice. Those braided cables could work pretty good as well. Plus they have a nice clean terminal connector on each side. 
Got a link for those things?

I don't understand, all depends on how much amps you like to get out of your pack no? 

I as well found this one quite interesting too:
http://www.e-sk8.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=649

Sorry, it's in french, my french is quite bad actually, but the pictures will do. I thought it is quite interesting how he did connect the P3 cells and how this guy seems to connect them to a two layer pack but then actually seems to fold it back to a single layer pack. This way he only has to strengthen some of the connections between the P3 cells too. (hope that makes sense ;) )

Yes you are correct but we are only asking the nickel strip to handle the current load over 1/2 inch span. One way to do a rough and dirty test would be to add a 1/2 inch segment to your power mains and go do some steep hillclimbs at max throttle. If it gets hot then it may need to be wider.

@treenutter I have not tried to spot weld these strips yet. They are still on order, but I'll let you know what happens. 
My pack is going to be very close to Whitepony's build here:
https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=70435&start=75#p1166305
He uses quite large strip and gets a really nice result!!  You gotta scroll down to the pics on that link. It looks like a very solid connection. Both electrically and mechanically speaking. 
I bought a few different strips from various vendors and not all of them are legit!! I got some from a Chinese vendor that were supposed to be pure nickel, but they were plated. I scratch up samples and soak it in a little bit of salt water too see if any red oxidization forms over a few hours. If so, it's steel plated with nickel and shite. You can also hit them real quick with a grinder and if sparks come off, it's steel.

How does the charger you have listed connect to the pack? Is there a plug on the BMS board or does it require something additional? I'm used to seeing balance plugs and a lipo charger but a charger with a simple single plug and no programming would be much more ideal!

## \#51 Posted by: Ulfberht Posted at: 2016-05-23T07:33:49.164Z Reads: 483

It's pretty much the same deal for 18650 with a BMS as for Lipo, but the main difference is that the balance leads are wired into the BMS, where on a lipo you would hook the leads up to your balance charger. The BMS only needs to have the power connector that matches your charger soldered on and BAM!!

Check this out. Testing three different strips from different vendors to find the perfect material. Here's my results:

The first one on the left is what came free with my spot welder. The second one was ordered from an ebay vendor from China who assured me these were pure nickel. I did get my money back...The third was from a us vendor that also swore these to be legit. Very legit indeed!!

Also the most expensive of the three. Hence the small sample. Salt water speeds up the electrolytic process of corrosion, but imagine what could happen over time with these inferior materials rotting away on your sweet 25Rs or HE2s? Especially if you live in a super humid climate. Food for thought! :v:

There's no documentation for this 2A charger, but I've confirmed with the seller that the port is a DC5.5mmx2.1mm. I bought this one from mouser, but of course there are tons of them on ebay. For $2.50usd, I figure it's worth it to get one that is a bit more robust.

@treenutter I'm stoked that it was helpful. I really am all about building the best possible product, so it was important for me to get it right! Seeing those other strips turn into rust in a day was really eye opening for me. I know a few people are using the plated strips and with added reinforcement to the serial connections should work fine. However, I just know with current running through, it will only accelerate the corrosion process. Corrosion=extra resistance and heat.  The strips that I finally went with are worlds apart in quality from the other two strips I bought. My sample piece sat in heavily saturated salt water for over a week with not as much as a color change in the metal.  Bonus is that they are also fairly thick, which adds to the structural integrity of the pack.  These are the same strips that Whitepony uses on his packs. Good luck with your pack build! I can't wait to see what you cook up, my friend!! :thumbsup:

The one linked in your first post, doesn't match the picture here, and i don't see the e-switch feature in the list for it?  Can you confirm which BMS that also has e-switch?  Assuming this also handles anti-spark?  Any trickle draw to be concerned about for storage w/o unplugging batteries?

When using those switches make sure to have it in OFF state before connecting the power source. Else it might not work well in the beginning and will remain in ON state. If that happens just put the switch to OFF and dis- and reconnect the power source again.

Thanks @MasterCho the BMS is the problem here... it's 80a and larger than a typical BMS for this purpose. I'll try out the fitting without the boxes; I might gain a few centimeters once the pack is all glued together. If I'm careful I might be able to stack the VESC and the BMS on top of each other, but that presents a bunch of other potential problems (namely heat and the danger of shorts.

Thanks @MasterCho this is a good suggestion! I need the BMS (which is the root of discharge in this case) to be close to the VESC since I use FOC mode... further than 20cm and FOC has issues. 

I think that running the discharge cable all the way across the enclosure might be too much. I'll experiment with different configurations once the packaging comes off.

OH man!! I haven't had a chance to try em' out with everything going on lately. I have the same welder, so I might need to rethink going with such a thick strip or try a different welder. I suppose the option to solder direct to cell is there too. I have an 80W Weller soldering rig that would probably work OK, but I would like to spot weld them to save a little time. Thanks for posting your results. This is disturbing news. LOL 
Here's an interesting option that is supposed to have higher conductivity and is @.127 instead of the massive .25. A little spendy, but worth a second look.

I believe it's copper core. I would like to hear if there is any other opinions about this stuff. It sounds like it could be good, but it could just be mostly hype. It's not like the gaps are going to be that big for the current to flow across. Copper is going to have lower resistance and handle plenty of current. I like the corrosion resistance of pure nickel, but I'm open minded about whatever works well and is easier to manipulate. I really liked the quality of the 12.7mmx .25 Pure nickel strips, but...

I'm pretty sure most of the nickel plated strips are steel plated... That's one of the ways you can test if it's plated or not, take a Dremel to it and if it sparks, it's plated, since steel sparks.

With @Ulfberht 's help I finally found a legit roll of nickel! Both of these were sanded and took a salt-water bath for 3 days. On the left we've got pure nickel. On the right, nickel-plated plated and not worthy!

I'm not sure if my process was the best, but this is how I did it. Started with tacking the parallel connections. Testing each one with the multimeter to make sure a good connection was made.

Then I arranged the cells in order and started making the serial connections.

Here is where things went wrong. This spot welder is known to overheat if used too aggressively. Being a novice welder, I didn't understand what "too much" was for this tool. The triac is poorly ventilated and overheats, and thus provides inadequate power if it doesn't cool. That was my problem.

When it was time to "unfold" the pack, a handful of the later welds disconnected. You can see it if you look at this photo from right-to-left. The rightmost (earlier) welds are good, the latter ones broke.

I'll try it again but this time I will give the welder 30 minutes to cool after every 200 welds or so. I'll also put it on it's own electrical outlet instead of sharing one with the rest of my bench.

I'll also place a cooling fan aimed at the vents to get extra airflow through to the Triac while I'm welding.

Nice work @treenutter!  I got the same 8mm x .15 nickel strip.  I'm going to try with my arduino controlled spot welder (battery powered vs wall plug).

I'm a bit concerned by the 8mm width - will this be enough for the amps needed to drive a dual motor setup?

Lots of debate about this. Some think it is enough, others argue that heat could be a problem. I think it comes down riding conditions and whether you're really pushing the discharge capacity of your pack. I know that I won't push it extremely hard (i've chosen this setup to be more robust than I really need) so I think I'll be fine. @chaka commented on this, so I'm feeling confident about it.

[quote="chaka, post:45, topic:2087, full:true"]
I doubt the 8mm will even get warm to the touch with a single layer, I could be wrong?

Finally finished this pack build. Why such delay? The original Bestech BMS I got through our group buy was faulty; the switch didn't work, but worse, it drained one of my paralell packs - all the way to zero :( 

So I had to dismantle the original build and replace/reweld a new paralell pack, acquire a new BMS, and rebuild it.

I ended up with a 60A BMS from Suupower. The BMS seems to charge/perform properly, but the built-in switch that they added doesn't work. This is a known issue with BMS from Suupower (I have the impression that many built-in eswitches fail or don't work). So I chopped off the rocker switch and soldered the eswitch wires together, leaving the BMS in permanent "on." 

I installed a Vedder antispark switch from @elkick for my on\off and that is working well. 

I wrapped just about everything in kapton tape, if anyone is building a pack I recommend buying a big roll of this stuff!

The balance leads are way too long, I could trim them to look better, but the pack will now live hidden in an enclosure, so I decided not to take that extra step.

I really wish the BMS used surface plates instead of hole-thorugh connections for the power leads; hole-through connections with 10AWG wire leaves a weird bend that makes it hard to place the BMS anywhere without adding height to the pack.

I tried using this clear heat shrink to seal the whole pack together. It adds that sweet fruit-basket effect that we all hope for :slight_smile:

Huge thanks to everyone who helped me to get this done, especially @barajabali and @longhairedboy for their advice from pro battery pack builders!

Testing before I tape everything up:

It's a great moment when the charger light turns green and the pack reads 100% and isn't on fire!:boom:

I have the same %-monitor, but I haven't hooked it up yet. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't the %-monitor be more accurate if you switched it to 10S5P?

Since everyone says that the %-monitors shows 20% remaining when the battery is dead? A 10S4P has the same voltage as a 10S5P when at 100%, but loses voltage at a higher rate when draining. 

Am I mad or doesn't that seem like a good remedy for showing the wrong percentage?

Just noticed that my %-monitor only goes to 4P.... I'll have to pick up another one.

@longjohn you seem to have some strong thoughts about BMSs. You've stated in a recent poll and now in this thread that the BMSs that DIY builders here on the forum use are inferior. An all-caps warning? The models used in this thread have been field tested for about two years (or longer) with success. AFAIK, you've never suggested a solution or alternative source for these parts. If you have a recommendation for a better BMS, please share it. 

It seems that most of your comments on the forum are disparaging and unhelpful. Have you got anything useful to add here?

This monitor doesn't have an option for 5P, and it wouldn't matter if it did; it presents a percentage derived from the entire pack's voltage, regardless of capacity.

Well actually it does matter. Why else would you be able to input how many P there were?

You are correct that the percentage is based on the voltage. But if you travel 1mile with a 10S4P it will drop to X volt. If you travel 1mile with a 10S5P it will not drop as much in voltage as the 10S4P, since the additional cells instead loses some mah. 

So if you had a monitor that could go to 5P, you would probably get a more accurate reading.

I don't think the P in that meter is what you think it means. I think they may be for lead acid batteries. I have the same meter, it doesn't measure mah only voltage. You're thinking of a coulometer which is a bit more advanced than this one.

Additionally, choosing an amount of parallel cells doesn't make sense since different cells have different capacities.

Thx @UniqueSnowflakeN27... I believe input value of "P" on this device is for lead acid batteries, not to set the number of cells that are in parallel in each series. The only setting that's useful in my application is to set it it "10C" which is declaring that there are 10 cells in series (which are, in this case, parallel packs of 4) . The nomenclature is confusing because "P" and "C" have different meanings in our typical use of them.

I don't think that these cheap monitors account for "P" at all. I think there is a void that someone could fill if they designed a smarter voltage monitor that could be programmed for all of the potential uses. In retrospect, I would have preferred a monitor that displayed voltage rather than percentage. I have no expectations that this monitor will be accurate enough to rely on.

EDIT: I see that @Jinra got to the LA battery issue before I did, thx @Jinra

My original plan was to use a coulometer (see link first post), but I decided against it because of the added size (and to a lesser degree cost).

Yea, it's nice to see more data about your cells, but it's largely unnecessary unless you're really into accuracy or want to test cell efficiency.
