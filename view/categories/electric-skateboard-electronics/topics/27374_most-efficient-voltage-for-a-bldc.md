Is there a way to determine to most efficient voltage to run a motor at for a given power output?

I've heard that the most efficient RPM range is ~80% of top no-load rpm. Does this apply at all voltages? Is higher voltage always more efficient?

The grin technology motor simulation tool tells a lot.  If u do a search for it it'll show up.
Higher voltage can be less efficient.
