Just about finished building the battery pack from Samsung 30Q 18650’s. 12S8P setup.

Looking for recommendations for a decent BMS That isn’t too expensive.

Also a link to a charger & VESC would Be great!![image|666x500](upload://7n4yOFB95GjkPUQA8D3q1reRYq9.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://2Q0a3bdN2QWfWcO26Lt1CWo5Fzj.jpeg) ![image|231x500](upload://upLa51tIdDZ6B3v152rQpVK138A.jpeg)

Do you want to use it for charge-only or for discharge?  How much space do you have?

Don't forget [a fuse](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/576-099707.5WXN) for the charge port
