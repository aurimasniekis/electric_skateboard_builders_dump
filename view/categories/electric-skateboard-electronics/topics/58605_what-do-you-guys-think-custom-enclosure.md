I can make as long as needed.. depending on the project.. just might have to make a new frame and heater box but thats not hard.. with this current setup 24inches by 9inches

Awesome, yeah, I just re-did my form box to try something different and ran out of weather seal so I tried it with out that on the star one and the wood on wood was loosing air, so ran out and bought some and re-did it and it came out great! Thanks!

Potential for custom orders if the images were fairly basic?

Not that advanced yet.. I'm basically just using 1/8 inch already cut wood craft shapes.. but if I put my mind to it, might be able to go crazy.. I could probably invest in a 3d printer and make the designs with that

I like it. How about making some sectioned flex enclosures.

Thanks! What do you mean by sectioned flex enclosures? Do you mean like for just the battery and just the enclosure? Like what boosted/meepo uses?

Yeah I'm going to start doing it.. I'm going to be using 3/16" ABS instead of 1/8 inch.. feels a lot sturdier.. I'm about to post it up now
