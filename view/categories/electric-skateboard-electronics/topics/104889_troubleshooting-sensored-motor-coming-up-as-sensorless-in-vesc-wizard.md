Hi everyone, 

I have a 4 hub motor board and one day I noticed that one of the 4 wheels was operating like it wasn't sensored.  It didnt have a smooth start like the others.

When I plugged the VESC into my laptop, I noticed that it was coming up as sensorless.  I have taken the motor apart and have checked for continuity to the pins from the sensor chip and it all checks out as good.  I have also swapped VESCs and the problem swapped so I know it is the motor and not the esc....


Anyone know what further steps I can take to try and resolve this?  I really would prefer to not have buy another motor!!!

Thanks!
