Im using the 6s esc and programing card used in the vid and it works but the motor acceleration has a weird "punch" to it where when i just tap the throttle forward the motor spins at almost full speed for a second or so before going to whatever speed i am actually at. Any idea of how to change this?

He is fairly easy to get a hold of that way.
