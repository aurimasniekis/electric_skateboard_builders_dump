Magnets and bearings are the top weakest points. I would say in general with any motor, 160F is the hottest you should ever hit. If they use good magnets and bearings, 200 is ok, but anything above 180F can permantly damage most magnets.

Does the foc box have a way of controlling motor temp or it being monitored by bluetooth?
