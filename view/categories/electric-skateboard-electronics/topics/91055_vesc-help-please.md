When I bring power to the vesc it turns on then off, if you hold the cables in different positions it turns back on then off again. There's a clicking part coming from the top of the vesc. (The part that's in the photo).![IMG_20190418_200844|375x500](upload://7IHVW1EXrycHS6m85uuCuKjltHe.jpeg)

Can we see the rest of the board and electronics so we can rule out any other possible issues as well?
