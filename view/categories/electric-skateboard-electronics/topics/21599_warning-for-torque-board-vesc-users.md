Hello all i want to start off by saying i love my motors and speed controllers I purchased from torqueboards and I had a great experience with them and there remarkably fast shipping.   I also am very impressed with the quality of there products so far!!!

However upon inspecting these guys I noticed the power wire on 3 of the 5 vescs was being punctured by the backside of the hall sensor port!! im glad I noticed this befor powering up to do some testing tomorrow!!   I solved this issue by cutting the shrink wrap and routing the power wires on the outside of the shrink wrap....   just thought i would share this with anyone as I foresee some possible issues here. 

examples

Sounds like his vendor messed up. This is what I suspected and why I suggested letting him know.
This issue is actually old news on the forum.
Some unfortunate folks have fried their vescs because of this issue.

This has been a design flaw in the VESC since day dot. Who designs a PCB with the power connection in the middle of the board?

I have a VESC from torque boards and I think mine may have shorted :/. When you were testing yours, for the VESCs that did end up shorting out, once you gave them power did any lights turn on on the VESC or was everything completely off?

Ya I probably will. If you do end up applying power to one of them, you should let me know what happens.
