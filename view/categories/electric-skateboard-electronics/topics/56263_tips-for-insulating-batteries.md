Hey guys! I'm doing my first battery build: a 10s4p samsung 30q upgrade for my Evolve BGTx. Like everyone, I'm trying to avoid shorting any of my batteries and starting a fire and the key to that is insulation and making sure the battery doesn't move around. I've added the paper insulating rings around the positive terminal of all my cells but aside from that, are there any experienced battery builders out there that can give advice on how I can best insulate my battery?

I don’t know if this is the approved way but I bought fishpaper with tape on it and wrapped my pack with it. Didn’t have a picture of the finished build but it’s all wrapped with this tape where contact can be made. Hope it works :smiley:
