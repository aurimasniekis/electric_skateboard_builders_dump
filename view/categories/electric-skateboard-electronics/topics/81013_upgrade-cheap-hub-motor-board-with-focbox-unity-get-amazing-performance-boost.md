**We put a [Focbox Unity](https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/), paired with a [Nano-X](https://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/nano-x-enertion-2-4ghz-controller/) in a generic hub motor esk8.**

We got some very surprising results! Most notably a 32% increase in top speed... WOW!
Huge improvement in acceleration, speed, torque and overall improvements with control of throttle/brake.

https://youtu.be/MqVXMM8iahM

**We did three tests.**
1. A-to-B 30M sprint from a stationary start.
2. 100m hill climb up 10% gradient from a stationary start.
3. Top Speed test using GPS phone app.

We got improvements in all three tests & we will be posting a video soon so you can all see how we did the testing.

Awesome news. I’m in the process of upgrading my focboxes to a unity. I was planning on putting the focboxes into my sons generic hub motor board. Glad to hear it may be a performance upgrade !

some of these folks have the ability to service the US market... should ask them to stock the unity.

Use Unity with MeepoV1's switch.
Change the wiring layout.

I read this thread and thought of using meepo's switch.
It is not going ahead from there.
I was predicting that Unity is a strategic product that can upgrade cheap boards.
Everyone in Builders will use unity to build high performance boards.
But Unity is a good choice for upgrading the cheap board.
I think that beginners are good threads to step up.

Actually this can be achieved with any VESC based ESC :P Depending on the programming of the orginal ESC there will be no speed increase because its limited by KV but torque will improve a lot.

@onloop I saw this specs about the unity. 
I was thinking about setting up 70A each motor and a current of 140A from my battery (12s)

Is it okay to use those settings? So can you promise me that I will not demolish the unity with these settings?

Yes but you will need 2 Unitys connected over CANBUS. AWD is more complex but you would have a hill climbing monster.

The standard ESC seems to be limiting speed. 

With 2x standard vesc you need to buy a seperate switch and it probably won't fit inside the case.

Unity is definitely a better option!

I was just asking about this a week or 2 ago and it's on my list of mods.

Did you use the stock battery on meepo?

When will foxbox unity be available for purchase? It shows "pre-order" on your website. Do you have any dealers in EU?

Got some focboxes in a meepo and the top speed has improved a bit.  The torque though has improved but not before I fried the bms on the battery.  Word of warning to anyone performing this upgrade.  Make sure the battery can handle the extra current.  Don't go slapping in a unity and thinking cool now I can run more amps.  You can but only safely another 2 per vesc on the meepo 10s2p.  Not much of a difference.  The sanyo battery though is a bit more leggy as is the 10s 5p but again be aware the standard esc is only set to 18 amps per vesc and as such has a bms rated accordingly.  The cells are very limiting and to really unlock the motors you need to do an upgrade.  For example both the 10s3p and the 10s2p blew a bms at 25 battery amps per motor.  I was just loving killing chinese boards that week.  Point is be careful of the battery before making any serious amp changes.  On another note the hubs on an enertion 10s4p 30q and focboxes rock.  Torquey and fun.

Asking for more amps than the cells are rated for by switching out the escs and upping the current drawn sounds a quick way to ruin the cells if not worse.

Its simple really and while anyone can flag anyone for anything it has to be a multiple scenario before the post is removed.  Once you flag you get a list of options that ask you to identify the issue.
This one was particularly off topic for this thread as there is a whole thread dedicated to the drives.  I'm guessing an off topic flag was raised by a few guys or someone with some juice.  Things get messy very quickly otherwise.

I think those bms are 40a ones, 20a per might be ok 

Also drawing more than rated should either just shut the bms down or limit the amps automatically why would it fry I wonder. 

Meepo are using 25r packs so 40a total is ok

Nice video, very professional I must say 👍 
So how much less battery did you get with the unity? Cuz I guess you raised the amp draw to increase performance?

Only 21MPH on a meepo v2, seriously? I have not seen 1 reviewer have a problem breaking 25 on them. That dosen't seem right. Also, this won't even work on 90% of the configurations of the meepo because they don't have 40A batteries. Kind of seems misleading if this is on the 25R meepo only.
```

## \#43 Posted by: Deodand Posted at: 2019-01-21T18:50:38.437Z Reads: 135

Do you have statistics on meepos customer base? Where are you getting 90 percent? I'm pretty sure many of the boards ship with the 25r battery as it's the cheapest. 

Different conditions = different top speeds.
```

---
## \#44 Posted by: Meeep Posted at: 2019-01-21T20:19:35.329Z Reads: 131

```
I think they are referring to the thousands of older boards with 20r or lesser batteries. However, 90% is pulled straight from the arse. The new Meepo NLS is the only version that uses the 25r cell afaik. The v2 (which is the one used in the video ) uses 20r standard.

As for the top speed... idk isn't Jason over 200lbs? I'm 150 running 11s on the standard esc and top out at 27. Seems like the amp limits really kill performance for heavier riders.

The 20r 10s2p packs can still do 40 amps discharge it just has smaller capacity if I remember right.

Oh yeah right on the money. It's the really old samsung 22p packs that were abysmal but they haven't used those for months so most riders should be able to drop in the Unity and get that performance increase. I can't wait for mine!
