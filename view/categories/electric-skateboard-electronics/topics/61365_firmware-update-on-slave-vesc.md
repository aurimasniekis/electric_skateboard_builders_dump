Apologies for the noob question - I have my master VESC set up and working with Nano remote.  Yeah!!

Getting ready to hook up the slave, following instructions here from @onloop -

However, I have not plugged the 2nd VESC into the laptop to configure anything. 

**Seems like it would be a good idea to at least update the firmware....  is that necessary?**
