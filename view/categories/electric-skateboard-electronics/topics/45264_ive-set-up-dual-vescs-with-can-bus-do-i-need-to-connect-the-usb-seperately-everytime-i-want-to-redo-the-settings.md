# I&rsquo;ve set up dual VESCs with CAN BUS, do I need to connect the USB seperately everytime I want to redo the settings?

So I've got my dual drive running over CAN BUS but now I want to configure the settings again. Do I need to hook them up to my computer seperately like I did the first time or can I just plug in one(the slave) and it will pass over the new settings?
