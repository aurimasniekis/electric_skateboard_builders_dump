I recently purchased a Dss50+ lacroix board and was encouraged to download the ackmaniac app for android. I was going through the settings and realized i have no idea how to do any of it. If any kind soul who has the same board, (and a good understanding of how to set it up) could share their configuration, i'd be eternally grateful.![Screenshot_20190101-144934|281x500](upload://zH6nRfUmYqNUoVBxXFgLJSPtVnM.png)

These values should match the soc (state of charge) of your battery.
Here is a diagram for LiIon

You can use "LiIon" as Battery Type and it should work well
