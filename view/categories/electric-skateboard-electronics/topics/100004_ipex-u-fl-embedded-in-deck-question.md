I have a dumb question, I have a carbon board and carbon enclosure build and am worried about remote signal issues.

If I run a Ipex (u.FL) to SMA cable from my enclosure area to an external location, will it allow me to change from the questionable 915mHz remotes to the next-gen 2.4ghz remotes without issue?

In other words, can I future-proof my board if I permanently mount a Ipex to SMA cable in it? Itâ€™s just a matter of having the right antenna at the end of the thing right?
