I got a FOCBOX from Street-wing 2 months or so ago. Arrived next day in UK and its been working great.
Also @DavidBanner (owner) has been great at answering some of my questions and making sure i got everything set up correctly. 

I am actually just about to buy another from him and upgrade to dual :smile:

Hi, I  gathered some basic information about the GPL-license, so that vendors can avoid unnecessary GPL-license violations. Hardware usually contains firmware, which is GPL-licensed!
I have the feeling that a lot of vendors are not aware of the obligations, 
which should be easy to fulfil, once you understand them.
I hope the thread helps to sort out existing issues.
I hope the thread helps customers to understand their rights.

This thread should be purely informative and help to understand the matter! 
Please read the GPL and make sure your service is in harmony with the license.

@onloop is there any sort of update on the shipping of units to resellers? Last I heard we were hoping they would go out before chinese holiday, which is in less than two weeks. 

If we have to wait any longer i'll have to bump my order up for more units. I'm already very close to backordering my entire subscription for the month.

We had the same damn mosfet shortage in 2016 during the initial 4.12 run. 

I couldn't get the particular brand of fet i wanted for my eswitches either, so i stepped up to the next higher spec one. 

I would suggest sourcing higher specced parts that are available, we're willing to pay a dollar more per unit, man. Lemons to lemonade here.

Wanted to buy this a few weeks ago but couldn't find anything available so ended up compromising with the TB VESC. It would also be nice to have distributors in Canada.
