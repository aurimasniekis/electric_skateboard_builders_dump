Hummies hubs are almost ready. They would qualify as better.

Im selling a pair of TB hub motors, heres the link 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/us-ny-mildly-beaten-dual-torqueboards-130kv-hub-motors/56433/6

They rode great and would look quite new with a new urathane sleeve that @torqueboards sells

edit: the pictures in the sell thread arent pictures of it cleaned of the road and urathane muck (that black dust?) if you would like me to clean them up and take more pictures so you can make sure I dont mind :D
