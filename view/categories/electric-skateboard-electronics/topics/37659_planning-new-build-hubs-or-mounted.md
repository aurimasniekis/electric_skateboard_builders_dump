Been out of the loop on the e-skate universe after getting my board 'completed'. Of course, with DIY, I'll never be satisfied and I want to add a second motor, but adding up the costs, it's just better to build a new board. 

How are dual Hubs compared to dual mounted?

I would recommend going with dual mounted motors, will always have better torque and startup speed than hubs. But if your going to go with hubs go with hummie hubs

Yeah, gonna go with mounted. I've already got good enough torque with a single motor. I was only considering hubs for it's simplicity.
