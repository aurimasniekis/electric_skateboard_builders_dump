Does anyone know what modulation freq this controller uses? i wanted to source a better receiver to tinker with rather than wait another month for the cheap bound option to arrive.

Hey,

I got almost same problem like you have, I´ve got Koowheel remote and dont know, if it gonna work with ordinary 2,4GHz reciever, like on your photo. (I can´t try it, still waiting for battery)

Good luck
