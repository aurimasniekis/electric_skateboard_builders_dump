As you can see, everything is fine before the last cell- but jumping beyond the last cell it drops to 2v. Should be closer to 16v as a simple 4s1p.

You guys have any idea why? All the connection points look fine, but I still can't get anything beyond that last cell.

Why not just measure the neg/pos of that single cell?

If I remember it came out to 2v aswell-

I'll get back to you tomorrow on that though

You could try to recharge that one cell alone to bring it back up. You don't even have to disassemble them. Just use alligator clips.
