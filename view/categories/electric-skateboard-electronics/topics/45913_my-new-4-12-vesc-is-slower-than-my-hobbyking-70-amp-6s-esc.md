My new 4.12 vesc is slower than my hobbyking 70 amp 6s esc?? I was pretty sure I set all of the amperages right and set my motor to it's max output (70amp)..  I wonder why it's slower.. plus my old setup was 6s and my new one is 12s. If you have any suggestions please help üò•

Connect these in Series and you should get a top speed of about 28 MPH

What's got me intrigued about this, is that if he connected them in parallel and is running 6s, the board shouldn't even move if he set up the voltage cutoff for 12s in BLDC tool. @Gabegds2001 Probably best if you post your settings cause there's a high chance your current voltage cutoff will destroy your batteries if you connect them in series

```
Here's a quick break down of how speed is estimated:
**premise**: No mechanical parts are changed
higher the voltage (# of series) = higher the potential for top speed
higher the current (# of c) = the more "power" to fufill that speed
Your speed will be capped by voltage regardless.
Rearranging the same packs does not change the range
```

## \#13 Posted by: pennyboard Posted at: 2018-02-08T22:50:43.283Z Reads: 168

```
Series and parallel will give you the same range. Range is determined by Watt hours. Watt hours are determined by battery capacity and battery voltage. So connecting in parallel to get 6s doubles the capacity but halves the voltage. So you don't gain any range.

Well crap I guess I messed up buying a parallel connector.... @GrecoMan it's probably working with the 6s in parallel because I used a "setup wizard" option and it probably automatically set the right cutoff.

Ah that makes sense. Deffinetly post your settings before you ride it again so that we can check them over and make sure you don't blow your board

Also if you have soldering iron, wire, and heat shrink, you can change a parallel connector to a series pretty easily

I can get the same speed with a 6s config and a 12s config. speed is mainly based around kV to voltage ‚Äúratio‚Äù. i don‚Äôt mind you embarrassing yourself, but when you start spreading fake facts it‚Äôs a different story.

I said the potential for speed. Doesn't mean you have to go at that speed. Speed is theatrically in direct relation to the product of kv and voltage. Yes, you don't have to operate a motor at full 12s voltage even though your battery is capable of supplying it.

You lost me there. Are you saying kv/voltage? Isn't kv already rpm/volt? 
Yes, I made assumptions that everything but the battery pack is the same.

if I meant rpm/volt I would‚Äôve said it.

for example, I can get very close to (if not more) the speed a setup with 12s/159kv with a 6s/270kv. the big thing that voltage changes is torque. 12s/159kv will have noticeably more torque.

I realized just a bit before you responded. I think you took into account the change of mechanical setup. I made the assumption of only changing the battery pack and nothing else. Yes, more precisely, changing the gear ratio changes the speed and recalibrates the factor in calculating the speed.
Changed it, it's all good. :hugs:

[/quote]

Wrong, torque is directly proportional to current, not voltage, but as your speed increase (same everything) the back EMF of the motor also increase, so you need more voltage to offset that and be capable of pushing the needed current into the motor, with more voltage you can keep the torque for a broader range, which is exactly why you go faster with more voltage, but the torque is the same (perfect world) if   the current into the motor is the same, no matter the voltage

Make sure you use lots of solder and cover as much area as possible so heat doesn't build up when you apply a lot current through the connection.

Them yes, if you used the same motor and same gearing the torque would be the same no matter the voltage, but in this case you give up torque to keep the top speed high. If your 270kv motor could handle double the current of 149kv one them they would be equal

The problem is that until the community dynamometer takes off, all this assume 100% efficiency all the time

Make sure you don't use too much solder and not cover "as much area as possible"?

Make sure to heat up the wires/connectors and let the solder "flow" into the joint. And use flux, if you don't have flux use rosin core, and leaded solder, lead free solder is a pain in the ass.

If your gonna stick with the 149kv motor, then switch your batteries to series for more speed.
6s..... 149 x 25.2v= 3754 rpm
12s... 149 x 50.4v= 7509 rpm

parallel..... 25.2v x 10ah= 252 watt hours
series....... 50.4v x 5ah=  252 watt hours
The range remains the same, theoretically.

There isn't a 12v supply output(that i know of). Vesc 4.12 should be fine without any heat solution assuming you don't blaze 30mph to work. If you really want that fan, get a 12v voltage regulator. The wiring is relatively simple.
