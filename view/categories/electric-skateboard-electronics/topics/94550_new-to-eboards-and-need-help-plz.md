I have been building and racing drones for a few years now and have recently fallen into the eboard world! It’s awesome and very addictive hahaha. I got my brother and I a couple used genesis hellfires for really good prices, and they have been great to us! I got a used boosted and wanted more instantly, so diy it is cause I wanna build!
 I have been reading and learning, but still a little lost on the esc side of things, the foc and bldc have me a little lost. From reading the unity looks great, but I figured I’d ask the people that love doing this! I have acquired a set of alien 6374 170kv motors and going to run them on a trampa deck/trucks and 7in tires and 72t/16t gearing. Also still very undecided on battery size. I would love for around 20-25 real world miles and a top speed of 30ish, I know gearing and street wheels can change that as well but think the bigger wheel/tire will make for a great board for multiple terrains.

For the other parts never built a mtb so don’t really know but would say probably a 12s6p or something

Yeah, I would say a 12s 5 or 6p for high amps and good range... I have a unity and love it and the app comes in handy. Plus it can handle some serious amps. You can test your gear ratio and wheel size here

I also have 2 quads that I love ripping around :smile:. Let me know if you have any more questions

If you want good 10s foc, go with the unity. If you want the extra power at no extra cost, go with the flipsky dual vesc 6.6. I prefer it and it has been an absolute beast. The unity couldn't handle the 80a+ i would need to pull from it for a considerable amount of time (not a 1 second burst for sure).

Thanks! I had read that the unity didn’t like 12s which kinda scared me when I punched in my info in the calculator and the 12s pack is what gives me the range and speed I would like to achieve! This the right one? It says fsesc and not VESC but the specs look great, I don’t think I need the one that can do awd, not planning on that yet haha.

Thats it, yes.  It says fsesc, but it is built using vesc 6 hardware. It runs vesc firmware as well. All the "fsesc" items are vescs
