As in the title, is it the done thing to get a 90 degree plug to exit from the receiver? Does this even exist?
Mine taped to the bottom of my board is a little exposed....

What kind of receiver is it? You could strip the plastic case and just bend the pins or solder a 90 degree ones instead.

It's a mini remote. 
Stuck to the bottom of the board with gaffa tape it's pretty vulnerable!
