Hey gang, 

I am venturing into building my own electric skateboard and I ended up buying the Red Brick 125A ESC, soon to realize that this ESC won't power the RX for my remote control. Based on a 6S setup, could I get ideas of what UBEC should I buy to power the RX?

I know people frown upon the red brick, I found out about that later, but for the price, it is worth a try. And then how do I connect> in parallel with the ESC?

thanks in advance

Cheers
PC

I think youre better of with the turnigy plush. friend of mine is using that perfectly fine for about a year now. It has also ubec. the extra money you spend on a ubec youre better of by using a "better" esc. Just buy 2 bigger 3s batteries and set them in series then youve lower profile below the board. instead of 2 6s batteries in parallel.

Hey @Galinsky,

Thanks for your answer. Point is, right now, I don't/can't buy another ESC, this is the very beginning and I can see myself upgrading the ESC to a VESC in the future, but not for now. 

What I am trying to understand is:

- suggestions for UBEC (6S setup);
- how many amps does the UBEC have to have? (3A-5A) is enough?
- how do I power the UBEC? connect in parallel with the ESC, with my 6S battery?
- how to power the RX? connect 2 cables to RX, one from ESC on channel 3 and another from UBEC on what channel?

I am actually doing a 6S5P with 2Ah 18650 batteries, what will give an even lower profile than 2 3S.

thank again for your suggestion.

3A at 5v is enough.
any UBEC will do with 6S support


The RX will be directly powered from the UBEC youve a servo (black red and yellow) those black and red are the power (5v 3A) the esc needs also that 5v. Thats how to set it up :D I do not exactly know which receiver you are using so I do not really know in which channel you have to put the signal cable into it will be explained in your manual of your TX and RX.

That's perfect, exactly what I wanted to see. Thank you :slight_smile:

About the TX/RX, I got the cheapest one I could find:

 I only imagine if I could power the RX from a different channel, so I don't have to split the wire from the ESC.

Should work perfectly!
However I choose for this one:
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tmhk-gt2b-3ch-2-4ghz-transmitter-and-receiver-w-rechargable-li-ion-battery-1.html

This because you get it with an accu which you just can recharge via your pc/laptop. You do not have to buy seperate batteries. The accu last also quite long!

I do not exactly know what you mean. but the esc also needs that 5v to function with the receiver. and the receiver itself needs also power.

Colourful batteries. Are they matched?
