Hey everybody,

TL;DR Can a detached wire cause a focbox VESC to delete some of its configuration?

So I bought the following kit from Alberto of eskating.eu back in autum of 2018, which contains two Focbox vescs:
https://eskating.eu/product/electric-skateboard-7020-watts-conversion-kit-by-eskating-assembled/?v=7516fd43adaa

Unfortunately the kit broke twice since then. The last time it broke, the motors suddenly stopped working midride. One of them was not running at all and the other one was really slow and without any torque. I returned the kit and Alberto mentioned, that some configuration files are missing. He claimed, that this was likely caused by a motor wire (he did not specify if he meant a sensor wire or another one) getting detached (maybe because of vibration or strain on the cables?). I tried to get more information about this issue, but unfortunately Alberto did not provide any more information and did not answer any of my last few E-Mails.

I just wanted to know, if it is possible for focboxs to delete part of their configuration, if wires to the motor get detached? If yes, I'd like to know which part of the configuration is getting deleted and if there is way to prevent this behaviour?

I think he mentioned that one of the motorwires got lose (I think one of the sensor) and because of that there was missing data  for the vesc and it came to an error and the motor started freakin arround because it was in the middle of your ride and in sensored mode. But cant tell what really happend without the board in front of me,

Vesc normaly cant delete sth just randomly.and than work again.

Thanks for your reply. He explicitly said, that some part of the vescs configuration was deleted due to a bad connection.

The first thing I tried was turning off the board, securing all cables and switching it on again without any luck. Shouldn't that normally fix the problem you are describing?
