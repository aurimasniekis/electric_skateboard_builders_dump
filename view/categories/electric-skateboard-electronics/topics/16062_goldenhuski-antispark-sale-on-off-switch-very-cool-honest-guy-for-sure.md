Where is the sale located? Looks like a very modest antispark switch (in a good way).. serves its function well, probably :)

hope he is crediting Vedder and Fechter.  Looks pretty straight forward - did he sell it soldered and ready or did you finish soldering it yourself?

No, the Switch does not care about the polarity.
Just if you use a LED Switch you Need to wire the LED correctly but the three wires of the Switch itself does not matter

@Redfire1 do you want to use a switch or a LED Switch? 
Also it matters how you connect the switch. When you connect the battery to the antispark, the switch should be in off position.

Ok, it is important that it is a latching toggle switch ON/ON (SPDT).

![20180314_225101|690x388](upload://d42rMGXWrZEviNXnmFZvyAW7YEV.jpg)

OFF (antispark) = NC (switch)
middle one (antispark) = C (switch)
ON (antispark) = NO (switch)

For the LED you need a resistor, you find info about how to calculate the proper value in this forum.
