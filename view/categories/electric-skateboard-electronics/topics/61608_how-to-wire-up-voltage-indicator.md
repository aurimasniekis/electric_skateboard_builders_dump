Bought a voltage meter off of Amazon, but not sure how to hook it up. My 12S pack will produce between 36V and 50V, but this meter requires a separate power source between 3V and 30V. I'm using VESCs from  (thought maybe there was a voltage I could tap into there). Any thoughts on how I can hook this up?

Thanks,
Jay

you can take it from the 3 long pins for the receiver. I think the out most one is Ground then 5v then signal. take a multimeter and check. or if you dont have sensor motor use ![image|690x445](upload://kkiqnqTJPutWApI3XcShd7WRzmE.png)
