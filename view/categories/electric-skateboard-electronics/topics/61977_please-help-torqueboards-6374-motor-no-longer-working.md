One of my relatively new Torqueboard Motors stopped working and I was wondering if I could get any advice if it's possible to fix it. The red arrows indicate some circular piece of metal inside the motor that came loose and rattles inside. When it was attached to my board, the motor was **extremely** twitchy, but if I held down accelerate for long enough it would work at max speed just fine.

That's your magnet retaining ring. Discontinue use of that motor immediately!

Damn it! You beat me to it.
@ih8Darian , you need to overhaul that motor! You need to check that all your magnets are in place and not loose. I would contact @torqueboards to see if they'll fix it for you, if you're not comfortable rebuilding it yourself. Looks like you might need to service those bearings to, pretty filthy looking. Do you know how to take those Motors apart? I might be able to help if not

U would do well to invest in some snap ring pliers lol but if u don't have any, get a Wal-Mart bag and a flat head... put the motor in the bag and on the shaft there is a snap ring... carefully pry it off so u don't bend it and then mount it to ur board and sit/stand on ur deck and pull on the can... it will be hard because of the magnets and the stator but it will come apart

I would post pics but I don't want to put my motor together since I'm trying to pull my stator off rn

When I get home I can record a video. For now, send a pm to torque boards to see what they can do to help. If all else fails you can send it to me and I'll try to fix it up... where are you located?

@itsmikeholland those screws ARE locktited in, and you WILL need to heat them before they will come out. From what i've read, they will strip without heat, and most definitely without the right Phillips size. You can heat them with a soldering iron

At the very least, I would be able to assess the situation and fix if possible. I could swap the bearings too.

It's up to what TB says, if they offer to repair it or replace it, definitely go that route. If you don't hear from them, or if they say they can't do anything for you (I doubt they would say no), I'll do whatever I can to fix it. Just pay for shipping and we're good.
