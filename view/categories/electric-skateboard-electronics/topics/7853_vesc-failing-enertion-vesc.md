Hey guys after finally getting my board up and running for a few days. I went to ride today and it wouldnt do anything, so I dismantle the enclosure and one of the lights on the VESC was flashing red. Any hints on this? This is the enertion vesc.
Last night i configured my max voltage voltage from 60 to 57. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2915bb629e2957c4aae862024dfc02f08650df30.jpg" width="281" height="499">

Plug it in and check. Sounds like a DRV fail.
