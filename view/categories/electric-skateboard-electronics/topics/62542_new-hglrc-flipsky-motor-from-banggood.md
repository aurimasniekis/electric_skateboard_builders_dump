Hallo Esk8èrs.....

I`ve noticed that banggood have listed two new 190kv motors from HGLRC.... (flipsky)

But i have a hard time telling the difference between these two motors, all the data looks the same, besides the color and look. Anybody knows something ??

They looks interesting

Except the price?

They are alright I guess, there a few design flaws that could be easily fixed by the factory but they are stubborn and decide these changes are unnecessary. There's a whole debate about these motors on the scepter dark matter motors thread

I took some very similar motors apart lately because I was curious. 
At the end of the shaft where the 2 grubscrews were I think it was presumed that they just bit into the shaft,(or not)
To my surprise there was a flat spot one side and a flat spot with a divot on the other. 
These ones shouldn’t move.

I haven't opened these kinds up, but their older motors were the same as what you described.

I doubt we are getting motors from different places just resell stores

I'm talking to a guy who sells this on aliexpress for 45$ a piece (Thats if we buy in bulk, like 20-30 motors). The problem is, he sells them with 10mm shaft and the shaft doesn't have the keyway. Nice thing is, he sells them in custom kv. 
So in order to get the group buy going, i asked him if he could get them with 8mm shaft and a keyway since i know a lot of you guys prefer it that way.

Well, thats where we are, he is looking for the factory that can make this shafts and i'm waiting.
But yeah, the point is they cost like 30ish from the factory, so asking 140$ for them is kinda uncalled for. 

Question;
What would be the demand if i get them with 10mm shaft and without the keyway. And maybe in 170kv and 190kv?

The flat area of the shaft and the flat tip of the grub screw was where my problem was. It’s. It that the shaft is rotation out of place. It was shifting left and right becuase the flat end is...well flat. The fix was drilling a small divot on the shaft and using a pointy grub screw which goes into that divot. This prevent my shaft from working its way out. But I still have a problem with the can moving along with the shaft

I just put loctite 638 on my shaft and hammered it back in. I hope it'll stay put this time.

Unless they changed the design/materials on these, the part where mount screws go is made out of soft aluminum.. Not good. A positive thing is that torque/power is good with this motor. I wish it didn't have all these design flaws, making it a real pain.

The red one looks like the Faraday motion "lightspeed" motor. It's on their (Faraday) site for 70 EUR a piece. Don't know anything about that one though.

Sealed motor craze might not even be worth it (for me anyway). 

SK3 is now lasting over 3000 km and was driven in autumn/winter during snow and rain, mainly off-road. It never overheats either. Never had issues with stones getting stuck in there, just a bit of sand grinding (resolves itself by riding). 

I'd just go for the maytech design / first link with that many issues related to the sealed motor. APS sells them cheaper though.

Doesn't make sense. Banggood does not produce the motors, so how could they take care of QC. These motors are all sourced from the same factory/just rebranded.

I couldn't help myself and ordered a pair directly from Flipsky. But I've ordered a pair of 150KV for my mountainboard build. I was in contact with them prior to ordering and they said they could produce 150KV or 170KV if required.

At only $89 a pop, worth a shot. After conversion I paid £153 which included the $23 shipping I think it was.

I kinda agree with you. Of course banggood, Aliexpress,gearbest.... Do not make qc nor demand it at all.
I have never heard of an evolve DOA but i got some doa's from those sites. Dealing with them is a pain in the ass because returning the goods is as expensive as the items.
Either evolve makes the qc or demands it.
Ordering expensive items from those sites is gambling.

The motor come with temp. Sensor , but i dont think i will use this 

Btw. I noticed that the shaft has two set screws in the can. Is this like all the others, or is this an improvement  ?

Motors received in 150KV, can't wait to get them going. 
Anyone know an easy way to test the kv?
Seen one method using a drill and multimeter, but seeing as they're sensored shouldn't there be an easier way?

If you have a vesc/focbox run a motor detection with vesc tool and go in the console and type kv. Divide the result by 7. This gives you the kv

From the picture looks like plain simple epoxy so be careful to not overheat as the standard epoxy becomes brittle at bit higher temps like 60-80ºC

I also did order some custom KV flipsky`s. 200km in mostly terrain and lot of amps, they are working perfectly fine. Time will tell how good they will hold Up. I ordered 150kv, but vesc-tool tells me that they are 165kv though.

No retainer ring :-(

But after switching to flipsky motors i have a wery loud high freq. Sound.... It's sounds like a gear drive , but it's not. Why is it impossible to find a decent motor ? My old sk3 was just bulletproof , No weird sound at all, they are only missing the hall sensors. 

@Kug3lis Do you know why the motors sounds like this ? Brand new... 

Listen to this, at the beginning, FOC mode btw.

U can’t determine if an epoxy can’t take heat from the color.   it gets soft with heat not brittle. That magnet retaining ring may help with retaining a bit but i think it’s more so for spacing them evenly.

Maybe the bearings are the source of noise n u could squeeze grease in or take off the shields n put it in

My 1 day old motor with broken magnet had several magnets loose I was showing to guys just now what even new motors magnets could be removed I think 50 degrees are killing motor epoxy or etc stuff... Also another side motor witch I didn't glued started making noises too and I think the noise source is that magnet gets off the metal can and starts rubbing stator, but I can't be sure until I take that motor apart to see if there is scratch marks on stator

Actually I talked to the reseller on aliexpress of those motors and they can make changes to the motor like adding a retainer ring etc. Maybe we can get it up to @scepterr 's standard. I am not a regular so can't organize a group buy but I would be interested in a pair of upgraded motors if the price is right. Maybe we can even get better prices from taobao.

EZO bearings, curved magnets (only makes sense if the bell or stator is also adjusted to close the gap) , retainer ring, high temp glue, conformal coated hall sensor pcb, silicone flexible phase wires, single strand heavy gauge motor windings.

Scorpion apparently had some good quality motors available, but only in smaller sizes. I also know brotherhobby produced a few in the past, but they mainly produce high quality race drone motors.

I am really tired about the motor situation, I have tried basically 4 different motor pairs in the past 4 weeks and they all have same issue, after several rides magnets became loose and starts making noises at specific rpms and if you tap down hard it even makes sound like something is fcked up inside of it...

I am really would like to get a normal pair of motors which would not get bad after several rides... 

If anyone wants to send some motors for testing I am up to to bring them through hell :D

The "C''-rating implies the internal play on the bearing, C3 in this case is a bit more than normal play/preload (>normal). It suits mid to high revolutionspeeds on a high temperature range. 
Generally speaking a higher the preload allows higher loads at higher speeds (less vibration) at the cost of higher drag. The play on these bearings can also be even further reduced when a pressfit is used.


Basicly a which can be used for any non critical usecases, it has a bit of drag to allow for less vibration on high rpm.

C1 - C2 - C3 - CN - C4 - C5
less________________more play

EDIT: corrected a bit (I sliped in the false category on the chart in my trades handbook)

On the matter of clearance, they really need to get the tolerances right on most motors

For example, on my TB 5055 motor, the smaller bearings have a too tight fit that the bearings don't spin freely when mounted on the motor, have seen that on 6355 also, hopefully going C4 or C5 will solve this, the problem is find these bearings with these clearances

Look what i found.... Solder balls burned into the copper....
When i measure between the 3 phase wires in the motor, with my LC meter, it all looks fine, but i got "over-current" failure sometimes, and the motors brakes by it's own. .... (Scary stuff)
Maybe this could be one of my problems with this motor

Only outrunner I ever saw that had pressfitted bearings was the tacon w 245kv.  The standard bearing at c0 has internal clearance intended for a slight interference/press fit anyway so with a slide fit you have extra room.   I doubt a c3 is worth doing on a slide fit especially unless you’re getting really hot and in my experience more important would be grease beyond the standard which typically only is good to 200f

It’s weird how in the wider world of bearings a press fit is the norm and it’s used for good reason but with skate bearings and even these out runners we use it’s all slide. Skate bearings are ridiculously loose but survive so who knows

Right u are. So with our slide fitted bearings, so with no preload, we should maybe be using c2 which are a bit tighter n have a slight preload I think

No, the contrary, with the pre load you want bigger clearance

For example, the smaller bearings on my TB 5055 motors have a too tight fit that makes the outer race compress and the bearing don't spin as freely as when not mounted, the bearings are 8x12x3.5, really small, so any pre load compress the outer race

The problem is that is almost impossible to find any clearance besides the default for these small bearings, online I couldn't find and every shop here said they couldn't find either

With bigger bearings this is less of a problem since they are much more robust and don't compress a lot when mounted using interference fit

I doesn't make sense go smaller on clearance, our application is really far from precision fit, and the diference is not that big

yea that's what im saying and with the more preload youd want more internal clearance.  so with a tight press fit or for high heat expansion youd maybe want c3 but if its a slide fit youd want it tighter and with a preload in the bearing and maybe c2 no?
```

the normal clearance is enough for most bearing is most applications and its already tight enough, the diference we are talking is in the order of less than 100 micrometers, between each class is even smaller

Looks like the bell is rubbing the stator on all the magnets in the pic. And at high speed?  Maybe imbalanced or bearings have play and centrifugal force is enough at high speed to cause it to hit then.  U COULD try balancing the motor and pinning the bearings down if they have play. 


Flipsky’s trials here on the forum have shown lackluster and escs are hit or miss even with the 6.6 it seems and warranties aren’t being honored as seems they should be.  Bummer


U could glue the mags too. Wonder how they respond to warranty claim on it

Apparently, they said that if I buy from them now, all the motors come with magnet retaining rings. I asked for discount on the motors and they said they will have it on October 1st, Chinese National Day. Not sure, if I trust that the motors have been upgraded.

The conversation
**Gemma:** Yes. Our 6374 motors are with retaining hoop. What you heard before about the loose magnet was only one of the very few odds. We ship a lot of motor and most of them work fine. So don’t worry.
**Me:** Okay. I was concerned because this is a new case of magnets coming loose. So I wanted to confirm if you have put a magnet retaining hoop or not. 
I sent the image above too
**Gemma:** yes if you order now for 6374, you'll get them with retaining hoop. btw where's that picture from may i ask?
