Why do everything lithium-ion packages fasten with a nickel tape?
Have you ever thought about the fact that this is a rigid structure and when a short circuit is a chain reaction.

This is a Tesla car battery.
You may notice that all the cells are connected through thin wires.
I think it works as a fuse with the correct cross-section of the wire. At the moment of preload and or short circuit, this wire burns out and does not give a chain reaction.

This is a homemade product that I found on the Internet.

What do you think? I have not seen a similar topic.

Notice on the tesla pack you don't see large solder blobs on the cells. That is key here in energy transfer. Tesla is cell level fusing their packs.
