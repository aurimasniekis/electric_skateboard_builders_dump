As I'm planning a dual 10S in parallel, I'd probably use a burst ampere of 160A, I've seen people use 40A on their anti-spark. This doesn't make sense as most batteries put out a peak of 50-100A easy.

You shouldn't get 50-100A under normal circumstances. I'd go for 60A. If I recall correctly you are getting 10-15A tops when going up a hill or hammering the throttle from standstill.

Thanks buddy I'll try 60A and see if I break them.
