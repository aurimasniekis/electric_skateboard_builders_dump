I saw DUFFMAN make his own VESC and soldered a seemingly arbitrary amount of ultra low esr caps on it.

Would I be able to purchase a few more caps to make a bank of them for my vesc?

What considerations for bottlenecking should I look into? Do I need to simultaneously upgrade mosfets or any other component for the bank to have a positive effect on performance?
