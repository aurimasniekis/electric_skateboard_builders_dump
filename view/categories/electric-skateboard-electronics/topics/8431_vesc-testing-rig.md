Iv'e got around 6 VESC's that I need to flash with software and test with the motor. Iv'e been holding off because 1) I procrastinate and 2) I wanted to make a rig similar to @onloop. Iv'e taken a look at this video https://youtu.be/N9kbYnCEkjw  but It still doesn't clear things up for me. USB splitter? 


I don't know, maybe it's the heat that's getting to me...

I think He might use some test probe ( http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en/test-and-measurement/test-probe-tips/2294778 ), but I hope you know these kind of setup can cost a few thousand, so for Only 6 board, better test them individually.
