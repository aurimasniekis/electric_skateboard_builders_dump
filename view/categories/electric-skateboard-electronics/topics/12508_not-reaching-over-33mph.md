Hey guys so I decided to do a speed run one day. I opulent get to go over 33mph on my vesc. Here is my setup 

97mm Clones
Vesc 4.12
12s
16t/36t 
190kv motor 

Any ideas why?

Check out this calculator, it will tell you what it should be. http://calc.esk8.it

Said I should be reaching right around 42mph. Batteries were fully charged and balanced also

On the calculator your top speed should be around 34mph, but keep in mind that the weighted top speed you'll get is only an estimate. Many things can effect your top speed so it could be above or below that estimate. If you managed to get to 33 mph then its pretty close.

That 42mph value is theoretical no load max rpm. eg, no friction/wind resistance etc.

If you want to reduce speed just change the motor pulley to 14 or 15t.

I get accurate calculations when I use nominal voltage and also account for 95% duty cycle for example my motor is 200kv and for calculations I use 190kv instead
