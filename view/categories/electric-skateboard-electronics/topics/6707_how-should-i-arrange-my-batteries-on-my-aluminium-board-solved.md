Hey, guys. So for my [first build](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/project-lite-electric-beer-pleb-build-beercan-board-single-tacon-245-10s-11600mah-25c-lipo-vesc-diy-mech-kit/4266/8), I already have my mechanical parts, motor, and VESC ordered. My only problem is my battery. I need a 10s battery to go with my DIY 6355 motor (230kv, 2650 watt, 12s max, 80 amp max). I wanted a 10,000mAh battery but am willing to go down to 6,000mAh because of a little issue. My deck is a little special.

I'm using a Beercan board, the  [Kegger 40" DTP](http://www.beercanboards.com/red-40-kegger-dtp-complete) to be exact. This thing is amazing but the one drawback is...

 * **It has a rail truck mounting system underneath which means the batteries can't be just strapped anywhere underneath.** 

I was thinking of putting two [ZIPPY 4000mAh 10S](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__21367__ZIPPY_Compact_4000mAh_10S_25C_Lipo_Pack.html) batteries  in parallel or two [ZIPPY F8000mAh 5S](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__16227__ZIPPY_Flightmax_8000mAh_5S1P_30C.html) batteries in series, but the issue is that if I just stick them under my board I have to put them in "on its side" which causes the batteries to jut out and I'm worried about clearance. I wanted to build my enclosure so that it would go lengthwise down the board over the "rails". Are there any other options? 

The dimensions of the batteries...

* [ZIPPY 4000mAh 10S](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__21367__ZIPPY_Compact_4000mAh_10S_25C_Lipo_Pack.html) - 150x44x66mm
* [ZIPPY F8000mAh 5S](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__16227__ZIPPY_Flightmax_8000mAh_5S1P_30C.html) - 170x69x44mm

Why you can't drill aluminium?

I guess I could, but I don't have many tools and the cheap drill and bits I have won't work on aluminium. How should I drill my board to make it work? I'll edit my post.

My main concern is clearance. Let's say I go with the two [ZIPPY 4000mAh 10S](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__21367__ZIPPY_Compact_4000mAh_10S_25C_Lipo_Pack.html) batteries and lay them down on their side. They would lay on their **44mm** side which is less than **2 inches(50.8mm)** so they would fit in between the rails but they would stick out 66mm. I'm using [TorqueBoards v2 Pro Trucks](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-v2-pro-trucks/) So I'm unsure of high they are. My board also has a drop down frame so the battery would mount about **10mm** lower than my trucks.

You could make a flat pack

Hit me up for custom battery solutions.  

I can make you Lipo Flatpacks
Or liion packs. 

I have a brand new 12s flatpack lipo on hand, i can add a BMS and charger with on/ off switch

Yes i make custom packs.  A flat pack is a lipo pack that is gutted out and put back together in flat orientation. 
I've built many packs for people on this forum without a bit of duct tape in them lol

Awesome, Do you think you could make one that is 10s with a capacity 6,000 to 10,000 and less than 2 inches wide?
```

that is a heavy request but...

With lipo i need at least 2.5 inches.   EDIT- i can order a lipo battery that would allow for less than 2 inches.  quality is questionable though. It would need a bms to ensure longevity 

Lion i can work with 2 inches as long as you have enough length.   how much length am i working with?


Even with the entire 21.5 inches. i can only make a 8s3p pack. youre prob gonna have to go with Lipo

Interesting issue, I have the Oat soda board.  I'm going with bigger wheels to solve the same issue.

I think you can use 26650 cells they're shorter than 2inches I think....

That's also an awesome board. I'm using 83mm wheels, which is pretty standard for Eboards but pretty big for me and what I usually board on. What battery are you using?

According to this [build](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/12s3p-a123-26650-pack-in-progress-d/3591) which is a12S3P battery using 26650 cells, which is almost exactly the same voltage as a 10SLiPo(37V), it would not work. The length of the [26650 cells](http://a123batteries.com/v/vspfiles/images/pdf/26650.pdf) is 65mm(2.5 inches) which is half an inch to long. Thanks for the help though.

I haven't 100% decided yet.  I want to get the wheels and trucks sorted then I can work out what ground clearance I have to work with.

How does quality become an issue with less than 2 inches? I would consider a BMS but I am not to knowledgeable about how to set up a BMS. That would be another thing I would need to fit under the board, Are they big?

The only brand of lipo I know that is less than 2 inches wide is a decent quality brand.  You have to take care of them for it to work properly and a BMS would insure long life 

BMS bigger than 2 inches but it's still small

That sounds like a pretty good option. How much capacity could you get me with a 10s voltage and less than 2 inches? Also, with a BMS does that mean I don't need a balance charger?

@PLEB You might want to check out this thread on making flat packs from regular lipo packs.

Thought I'd give the public an update on this battery I'm building for @PLEB s  deck.

Going with lipo to get the most we can possibly get from the space given. These cells are less then 2 inches wide which will fit perfectly and the pack will be about 15 inches long at 10s1p 
37v 8ah
It will feature BMS with charger
Soft switch
Percentage display

(Possibly an enclosure)
