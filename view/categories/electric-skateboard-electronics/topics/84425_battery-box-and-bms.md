So my questions are 
Is this a 10 s bms 
What does the swich actually do  
Is this a charge  and discharge type. 
Is there any anti spark here or needed. 

Does this setup look familliar or any good 
My last diy e board had lipos with no bms and had to be fitted and removed to be charged. This is all new to me. 
Thanks guys. I know i have a lot of reading ahead also.

Wouldnt it be a 9s if there is only 9 balance leads? Or 8s. 10s bms needs 10 or 11 balance leads. @b264 @Andy87

Figured the bms out and the 9 wires floating . There is actually 11 but no1 on the balance plug goes to the bms positive and pos main lead. And 11 last one black goes to black on the bms and neg battry lead. So that gives me my 10 bat count .
Im going to do some more research into how many cells im going to need  in parallel wjth 2x motors and controllers etc. Any sugestions. Thanks.

Hi guys in the process of building my battery and was just wanting to confirm what type of bms is in the spce cell that i have pictured. I have searced around here a bit and have seen that it is said to be charge only type with 40a fuze.looking at the negative tho it goes battery straight to bms then bms to vesc so that tells me its controlling my dischare. Am i correct or am i missing somthing. Cheers guys.
