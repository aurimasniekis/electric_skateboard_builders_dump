I want to use the [Space Cell pro3](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/space-cell-pro3-electric-skateboard-battery/) in my upcoming build which ends in a xt60 female connector to my knowledge. I also want to use [this](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/) Vesc with my build which has a xt90 female connector on it. My question is how would I be able to connect these two devices as they're both female? Any product that would make this easy? Thanks for the help in advance!

the XT90 has a male connector, but either way an XT60 wont fit into an XT90. You'll have to solder on a XT60 to the VESC or an XT90 to the battery. I recommend the former.

Would a converter like [this](https://www.hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-female-to-xt60-male-2pcs-bag.html) work if the xt90 is a male like you said? It seems to be a very simple change from xt90 to xt60.

Yea, though personally, I'd solder on a different head for less bulk in the board
