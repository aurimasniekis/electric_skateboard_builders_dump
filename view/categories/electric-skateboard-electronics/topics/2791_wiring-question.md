It looks okay to me the battery wire config is a little confusing, but looks okay. I have no expirence with the 3s to 6s balance connect and am not sure if you can get away with that. Someone else will have to chime in. Is the switch the built in one on the FVT 120a esc? Dumb question what did u use do design this?
