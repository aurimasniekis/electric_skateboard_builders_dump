I dont think you need the programming card...if yo uwant sommther ride, change the ESC for VESC :slight_smile: 
The batteries are ok, you will need series adapter

YOu dont have a motor mount and pulleys and other parts in your list...

Also you can get a balance lead harness (2x3s to 6s or 2x3s to 3s2p, but the 6s will be better for you)  for easier charging :)

Thank you for the reply.
Do you have an idea for a series adapter on ebay?
And I will be making my own motor mount

If you dont want to solder anything then [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/HXT-4mm-Battery-Harness-12AWG-for-2-Packs-in-Series-/390416857132?epid=1131394973&hash=item5ae6a8782c:g:jfAAAOSwjVVV3Hci) and [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/1pcs-HXT-4mm-Banana-Bullet-to-Deans-Male-T-Plug-Charger-Lead-12AWG-Lipo-Battery-/352066919229?hash=item51f8d2db3d:g:JKwAAOSwZKBZIrcv)
But I HIGLY recomend you to change all the conncectors (except motor to esc connectors) for XT90 conncectors and also making a loop key from XT90s and another series adapter...

I would advise you to buy the batteries from HobbyKing. You can get those exact batteries for about $25 (Aud). Apart from that all you will need is some pulleys or sprockets and a motor mount. Good luck
