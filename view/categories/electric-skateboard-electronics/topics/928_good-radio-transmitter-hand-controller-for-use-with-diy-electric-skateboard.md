[quote="OGP, post:1, topic:896"]
and probably way too many stupid questions.
[/quote]

haha we all started in the same place as you, so nothing is a stupid question!

as for the remote, you have two basic options, and people who will try to pull you either way:
wii nunchuk
2.4ghz rc remote

**nunchuk first** a wii receiver (for the nunchuk) is sold here: product/wireless-wii-wiiceiver/
*pros:* 
compact, light, cruise control
*cons*: can have sudden drop outs.. this is the main reason this remote has not won over all the diy eboarders. That said, the issue is being fixed as newer versions of nunchuk PCB's are getting released specifically to fix this problem.

**2.4ghz** an example of a popular one here: http://www.amazon.com/FlySky-FS-GT2B-2-4GHz-3-Channel-Transmitter/dp/B00FS2U9BA/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1451789234&sr=8-4&keywords=rc+remote
*pros:*
reliable!!! turn it on, it instantly pairs, and you could control your board from 200 feet away if you wanted too.. it just works
*cons:*
it is a bulky rc remote... with a little wheel on the side too. The Badwolf 3D printed enclosure can solve this problem, but it is one more step to take and requires taking apart your remote. 

personally, I'm all for the 2.4ghz remote- reliability for dayz

**Here's a really solid contender to beat out both of the two first guys though...**

Enertion now has a 2.4ghz remote that also has cruise control, a rechagable battery, and is compact. Only problem is it isn't released yet.. but it should be soon (within the coming weeks).

Thanks @cmatson!  

I've been reading this thread recently, and particularly interesting comments from lowGuido about the nunchuck controller:

@OGP - Let me know how your hub motor setup works in SF. I haven't yet set my hub motors up just yet.

There's also 2.4ghz Mini Remote - product/torqueboards-2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller/

Also Enertion's new cruise control controller seems awesome.

I'm a huge fan of the GT2B remotes. Dirt cheap and ultra reliable. Yes they're big, but they weight nothing, so who cares. 

My only recommendation with those is that if you live in a police brutality area, i would suggest painting it a bright color so that it doesn't look like you have a gun in your hand. I have a reputation for dark wit, but i'm only half kidding here. I'm thinking of painting all the ones i pair with my builds because kids are getting shot in my area over skittles and hoodies and shit and electric skateboards just don't need that kind of horrible press right now.

@cmatson I was just thinking that someone needs to do a "controller roundup" and here it is! Nice!

I'm currently using the mini 2.4GHZ that @torqueboards sells and it's great.
Pros: Small, reliable, costs less than a Badwolf mod, and @torqueboards has great customer service 
Cons: Requires standard AAs, so not easily rechargeable, no cruise control, may be too small for folks w large hands.

Scramboards also sells a [mini 2.4GHZ controller][1] that looks similar to @torqueboards

@lowguido yes you can, I've done it and it works, although it is slightly awkward holding it in that position. It's actually begging for a mod... Make the controller encasement easily to hold with the wheel in between the pointer finger and thumb. Hmmm maybebe I'll try this for science once the winter hits and the snow makes riding impossible.

So much pressure to make a good decision on that controller :smiley: .  It will be the last thing on my list.  Curious what @lowGuido comes up with.  I'm leaning towards the nunchucks out of form and space efficiency but then again I'm afraid of of this happening:

This can be avoided if soldering?  Why wouldn't anyone solder their wiring for the controller?

seriously.. solder ALL THE THINGS.

I cant stress this enough. any plug on a skateboard is a possible failure, and therefore a bad idea.

even if you are not using a nunchuck, solder everything

@OGP I agree with @lowGuido about soldering all connections, he's a soldering BOSS and knows his stuff! But there are more issues with nunchuck\vesc than just the physical connection, folks have also reported problems with radio interference. This is why others are designing a replacement PCB for the nunchuck encasement. @chaka is working on an implementation of [Vedder's nunchuck PCB][1] so hopefully some good things are on the horizon!

My personal experience has been that GT2B or the mini 2.4GHZ from @torqueboards are rock-solid and I've only had fun and safe rides when using them. I used a nunchuck for about 15 miles. The first 5 were good; a few weird hiccups, and slightly buggy cruise control, but I loved it overall. I really appreciated the DIY spirit of using a nintendo controller! Then I started to notice random dropouts.

Don't underestimate the horror of having your board dropout while you're traveling at a moderate pace (12-18MPH). When the signal drops the resistance from your motor and belt jerk your board backwards while your body continues to travel! You need to Parkour your way to a stop by rolling on the ground, or run it out, if you can. This can be really dangerous! Emergency Room dangerous. There is no controller cool enough to risk a fall like this.

From reading through the forums for a while, and based on my use of vesc\nunchk (this is without a wiiciever, which may mitigate some of the error), in seems that nunchuck components can vary in quality. Some people luck out and get a "good one" and others get a dud that works unreliably. This might be due to manufacturing tolerances that aren't tight enough for human vehicle control, but work out OK for playing Mario Kart. It might also be the way that VESC software interacts with the varying nunchuck hardware. Soldering can help if the issue is with physical dropouts, but there are other problems soldering doesn't fix.

My advice would be to start with a GT2B and keep an eye on the upcoming new controller options. @onloop's [new one looks great,][2] the new PCB for nunchuck looks good too.

@treenutter One of my suppliers offered that "backfire" remote to me. I pressed them for some information and it is also bluetooth so it will likely have the occasional drop in signal like everything else using bluetooth. Time to engineer a proper spread spectrum transmitter to fit into the nunchuck case.

@chaka that's interesting I was under the impression that it was using a radio tech similar to GT2B. I know that 2.4ghz can be used for a variety of purposes, including bluetooth.

@chaka what's your preference for currently available controllers? @OGP posed the question and we're trying to help him. Let's assume that the emphasis is on reliability and safety vs cool features.

In my opinion nothing beats spread spectrum. The gt2b being the most reliable/affordable, stay away from the quanum.  

Bluetooth is great for transmitting data but has its limits when speaking of uninterrupted signal. Yes bluetooth uses the same frequency as spread spectrum controllers but the signal is handled in a completely different manner.

Here is the receiver design for the china brand remote. What I find interesting is the way they have the 24v routed through the pcb. It looks like they might implement a wireless power switch in the future. You can see the nrf24l01 transceiver in the top left corner, same as the Nunchuck-RF Mod so it is indeed bluetooth.

@jacobbloy It looks like a single sided pcb, any thought as to what they have planned for the 24v on the pcb?

This is the China remote I got from helloskate about a year and half ago, it works great, but has the voltage inputs as well I bet that extra input is for lights.

Also for remotes if any one buys that 1/32 or 1/36 RC car that has the remote that torqueboard sells you have you the esc and receiver from the car direct just but soldering 3 wires to the pcb. photo<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0077d6128c91844f9a2cac96c2c0d97b29a97eea.jpeg" width="666" height="500">
Doesn't seem to work as well as binding it to a receiver but cheap you can buy these cars for $8-15 from alibaba.

Me too, we should build a hybrid. FHSS for throttle and braking, AFH for telemetry and auxiliary features.

 From what I understand FHSS (frequency hopping spread spectrum)  is a more reliable signal but can be a little "dirty" at times while AFH (adaptive frequency hopping) is a cleaner signal but susceptible to total drops when encountering sudden interference. 

FHSS is what is generally known as "spread spectrum"  but both FHSS and AFH are, technically speaking, spread spectrum radio FHSS just uses more of it at any given time, good and bad.

I did some reading on that too. I think that you're right about FHSS being the best bet fro any sort of throttle control, braking or otherwise. 

Telemtry (speed, rpms, live motor data, whatever) isn't going to street your face when the signal drops. Which is good because in some situations FHSS actually interferes with AFH over bluetooth.  I'm sure something can be done to mitigate those issues, however.

@trbt555 [Lecdec sells this remote][1] as well, although they don't package a receiver with it and they won't tell me if it has the ability to bind to a typical RC 2.4GHZ receiver. Via email they claim that they will only sell them to customers who have a "LecDec" which seems to be a rebranded Luoov (which is a rebranded something-else).

I still want to know how the cruise control functions..if it holds on a click it won't be safe. What happens if you fall and drop the remote after you set the speed?
The kama's cruise control only works until you release the c button. Do if you drop it your board will coast to a stop.

Press a key on the remote control. Left red LED will Flash for 3 seconds, the Green LED will Flash on the left side, then let go, power on the remote control to complete. After booting the LED lights on the right side. LED colors represent the battery on the right.

Toggle and rocker let PWM1 and PWM2 terminal of PWM signal output speed.

Press rocker down in the shifting process, that is, constant speed. Even the rocker to another location, speed and will not change. Press rocker down again, the lifting speed.

Skateboard downhill hold the b key, can be slow brake function.

If you want to shut down the remote control, when powered on press and hold a button for 3 seconds, after treating the left green LED is lit, release the a key.

one of the things I have heard about the backfire board is that the cruise control feature is speed limited at around 20km/h.
I don't know if that is a case of the remote control or the board itself, but Id certainly like to know more because if that is the case, limited cruise control certainly isn't perpetual steez :(

Yeah...That feature wasn't thought through very well. That's a huge red flag for me.

For the steez we need cruise control, but not without a deadman's switch. Personally I think all remotes for boards should have one. -drop your remote/or let off the DM switch, board zeros out.

@BigAl the problem w the nunchuck is reliability. Signal dropouts are more frequent. They are also harder to connect; if soldered poorly there are further problems. There are many accounts of issues with the nunchuck throughout the forum here and on ES. It's possible that you could set one up and have zero problems, but the risk is a crash or loss of control of your ride. See @cmatson's post at the top of this thread.

@BigAl unfortunately any of those things can happen. I don't mean to scare anyone; there are definitely folks who use the nunchuck with good results. But yes, a dropped signal or dropped physical connection can send you and\or your board flying.

i've been using the nyko kama since oct 2015 . 

in mid december i accidentally squeezed while waiting for pedestrian traffic light :vertical_traffic_light: to go "GREEN MAN"  , ......... and while all vehicles  ,  cars :blue_car: :taxi: trucks lorries  double  decker buses are oblivious ; my eboard  went ballistic and one car stopped as it cannot moved .
 the driver stepped out and see whats the problem while other cars from other lanes just slowly drove by . he lifted my board and placed it by the sidewalk . :cry:

as the masses start walking after the GREEN MAN lit up , i searched and collected all the pieces strewn on road . almost fully repaired , i am considering a new remote .

had to say this . i LOVED :heart_eyes: the nyko kama .
 but it does not have the protective cover or "ring" to shield it from accidental squeezes .

been searching the web , enertions remote , 
diysk8bddot mini remote , 
lecdec remote similar to enertions . all of which would cost me more than $100 singapore dollar and also i have to wait :hourglass_flowing_sand: :watch: :hourglass: more than at least 1 week for shipment . :unamused:

so i went to a local r/c hobby shop (plenty of hobby shops in sg), and the nice polite :woman: lady showed me a HUMONGOUS GARGANTUAN  remote similar to GT2B .  it is a  FUTABA 2.4Ghz 3 channel . 

she said $112 singapore dollar .
effective range to maximum of 500 metres .(we dont need that , do we ?)

 but i forgot which FUTABA was it . going to bring my eboard to the shop on saturday ( considering the rainy season and i am home grounded at least for now ) and test on site at shop to see if it works . will post here on comment . no need to create new post . i think .  

ok what do you guys think ?  will it work ? or not ?
any one tried it before ?

I can answer in behalf @onloop. If you buy from Enertion, it does come with a receiver.

How is the wiimote gonna talk to the esc?

You will need a wiiceiver to translate the toggle movements to the esc ....


Now that esc .... Won't work for esk8 

It's for a helicopter....no brakes

It's 60a....at least get something that is 80a minimum 

You need to keep reading

Sorry to resurrect an old thread here but wanted to add my own incarnation to the mix:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1864536

It's still a bit of a work in progress but is at least functional and seems mostly safe so far (though use at your own risk and make sure you bench test plenty before giving it a go).  Basically I used two nrf24l01 wifi modules and two arduino pro boards to make the transmitter/receiver and the arduino handles mapping values from the potentiometer attached to a trigger (spring loaded) to the microsecond values sent to the ESC via the "PPM" port.  Will post more details and updates in the coming weeks as I smooth over rough edges.  On the plus side it uses only 1 LiPo battery as opposed to the stack of AA batteries in my previous remote and has a built in USB charging port for said LiPo (based on a bit of testing the wifi and arduino pro were only pulling about 18mA so a 850mAh battery should last a while without charging).

Let me know if anyone has any ideas for improvements or things you'd like to see added to it... since I have the micro controller on both ends could do some more fancy things with feedback and lighting and such but nice how it is just sending 8 bit data along without any complications.

I was thinking of doing just this for my new controller, but now the code is done for me! I think I will change the design though as I want to use a slide potentiometer to adjust the speed, a push to make switch to confirm the user is holding the remote and a no move button (for traffic lights). The braking lights on the bottom of my board will be controlled by a switch on the underside of the board as I won't be turning on my lights when skateboarding.

I have seen the Koowheel remote and it looks amazing. https://personalelectrictransport.co.uk/shop/accessories/electric-skateboard-accessories/koowheel-electric-skateboard-remote/ 
It stays in ur hand and looks sick, how could it be connected, if at all??

The koowheel remote does look cool. 

So does the swagboard remote:

Not sure how to make these work for diy. I'd like to see a modded VR remote, like this:

Hm, it’s an interesting thread.  I read through all of this thread thinking that i will have a clear answer on what remote will be compact and reliable, but i have not arrived at that conclusion. Ive build a hanfull of boards using this simple/cheap esc/remote combo (a.k.a. Esc substitute). For flat Florida, this works well.

https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dual-motors-longboard-skateboard-controller-with-remote-ESC-Substitute/302812941839?hash=item46810ece0f:m:mEjYlp9id5UtRAwhPmlchiw

There are a lot of different versions of this product floating around the internet.  Ive never had an issue with signal loss between transmitter and teceiver. The board has never suddenly stopped sending my face into warm florida asphalt.  The receiver is built into the esc circuit. The transmitter has battery gauge for the skateboard battery (pretty accurate i may add), three speed options, fwd/reverse button. All the eboards i used this esc in, ive never had rc signal issue.

Esc im trying out now (fvt sleeping lion esc 5s-12s) requires a separate transmitter/receiver combo. Everything i tried so far keeps on dropping signal.  (ive tried 2 mini remote/receiver combos, and one full size remote). This board clocks at 27 mph and i dont think i can run this one out.  I will try g2b remote next.

Im confused on why a $60 esc/remote combo (dual motor 60a or 30a per motor) can resolve the connectivity problem, where as some remotes that cost more than $60, are still not reliable.

Here are the remotes that did not work for me:
