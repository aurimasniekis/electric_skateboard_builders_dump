Ok so my Xt90 series connector broke and I was going to solder it back to together but I am not sure with plugs I should solder together. It was the one without any wires.

If you're going 12S would have made the male one an antispark but otherwise looks good to me.  Would have worried a bit about making a little spark gap without them coated but looks good now.

I'm assuming this was designed to put four batteries in series right? if so, did it work?
