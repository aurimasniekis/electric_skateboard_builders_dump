Hi guys, just got a nano x remote and receiver and then realize that the servo connector is not inside. Where can I find it in EU. I found this one on ebay. Will it work? ![mobile|281x500](upload://lv8ok6i8Rm9FLEXxr2gdwlOB5ny.jpg)
Thanks for the help!

That looks like a servo extension cable (male to female) you need a servo cable (female to female)

Or you can just cut the male end off that one and solder the wires onto the VESC which is actually better

I am still waiting for the vesc to arrive. Then I hope so, but in case they don't could you tell if the cables are correct?
Thx a lot

How much dou you spend on the Maytech's?
I wish i would have spent 100 bucks more in the first place and got @stewii 's esc with housing. He happens to be in the U.K. like you.

I am in Belgium not UK but anyway closer than you. I know that Maytech is not the best but I am planning to run them in BLDC. Do you have Maytech too?

Hi thank you very much for your generosity, really appreciated. Do you know how much would be the shipping to Belgium? Apparently the Maytech VESC comes with the servo pre-installed but in case I need it I will let you know. Thx Thx

Yeah, i run Maytech's with the same Hubs you are looking for. I promise you, you want to run them in FOC and not BLDC. VESC'S for this Hubs is overkill, acceleration and torque are increasing with VESC'S but speed is not compared to the China ESC's. If you are not running FOC your efficiency decreases which means your range will be less with the VESC'S.
For future upgradeabillity just get good ones or go really cheap for your first build.

:persevere: that hurt! When I tought I found a sweet spot :grin:
I am not looking for crazy speed. I am using a spud, so short board won't be stable at higher speed. With a 10s3p 30q battery. I would aspect 40km/h and at least 20km range...
I see you also have the maytech hubs. Would you recommend them over the diyeboard ones. I know they have more problem with overheating

No, the Maytech's ones Urethane is quite bad and tears a lot. The meepo style one's are fine for what they are. They are also more efficient, better range.
If enertion would us just sell their drivetrain then @onloop even don't need a chinese assembly lineðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†

So I don't understand which hub motors you are using. I am planning to buy the one from DIYeboard which are like meepo but 500w each instead of 250W.

They are the same, 500W peak 250W nominal.
Look for the best deal.

Since @rey8801 does not need the cables, I'm interested, as I have the NanoX + dual FOCBOX and there is no cable around.

Is that ok? I'm in Spain.

I have this one

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/10cm-female-to-female-servo-lead-jr-26awg-10pcs-set.html?___store=en_us

just confirm that you need this one and I can send them in a hour or so but do not know about the delivery time, could be a week or so you might get them faster from hobbyking

I saw so many different ratings on this same motor and from personal experience, i don't believe a single word from the diyeboard description nor a word of what Jason is saying.
Maybe @dickyho can tell us the correct wattage of the motors. He is also selling them on e-bay and seems to be a reasonable guy, he might help you avoid customs and tax.
