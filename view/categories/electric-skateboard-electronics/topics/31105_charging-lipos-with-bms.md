I'm getting two [5000mAh 4S1P 30C](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-lihv-high-capacity-4s-8000mah-multi-rotor-lipo-pack-with-xt-90.html) with XT90 that I will connect in series with [this](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-series-adapter-1pc.html).
Was thinking about getting this [BMS](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/8s-li-ion-pcm-charge-4a-discharge-10a.html) and connecting it to a laptop charger like this 
https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0055NXUF4

It is going to run on a 213kv motor. 

Should I dive more into it or is it stupid.


Thank you for your help.

Adding a BMS to your battery setup is great! 
What do you mean about our thoughts? 
A lot of people on the forum build their batteries with a bms.
I would not use the BMS you listed though.
It has a max discharge rate of 10A cont. which is to little. You will either have to buy a higher rated BMS or bypass for discharing. There are a lot of people using BMS from Bestech or Supowersupply. (Including me)

I would suggest going with the 60A/80A model if you ant to discharge through the BMS. 
You can use whatever connector you want man, just buy a female and a male and solder them on. However the BMS doesn't come with connectors if that is your question

As you said, this will be a 8S pack which means you need a 8S BMS for Liion batteries. I would use [this](http://www.bestechpower.com/296v8spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D131.html) one.

Nope. You need 33.6 V ( 8x 4.2V) charger and that one is only 20V.

I would suggest reading up by searching on the forum about how this works.
I am sure there are Lenovo chargers which does 33.6V, if not there are other brands.
