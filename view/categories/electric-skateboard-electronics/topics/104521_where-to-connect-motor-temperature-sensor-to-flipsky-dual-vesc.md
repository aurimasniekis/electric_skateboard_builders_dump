Hello everyone,

I bought 10k ntc temperature sensor. I will mount this sensor inside my motor. However, I couldn't understand how to connect this temperature sensor on my Flipsky Vesc. Also, temperature sensor two inputs but there is no information which inputs where to connect? I will be appreciated for your valuable suggestions.

Those connections goes to board. If you check the wiring diagram in the section 5 it said that temp motor, one of cable should go there but I got two wires coming through from my sensor. Where should second cable goes on board?

Just the white wire in your hall sensor plug Is the temp wire.  There aren't 2 wires for the temp sensor
