I have just pulled a trigger on **LiitoKala 26650 5000mah** **20a continuous** discharge and **50a peak**.  24 cells for **12s2p battery** pack with massive **432WH**.  You know it's all for SCIENCE !! :slight_smile: 

** AND HERE IS THE KICKER THERE IS A KILLER 60% OFF DEAL ON GEARBEST RIGHT NOW - my 12s2p pack -24 CELLS - was only  112 $  !!!**

These are pretty unknown batteries in the ESK8 Scene but right now they are the best 26650 on the market. These cells have been tested pretty well recently and they are TRUE 5000 MAH. More over they 've been proven many times to be a lot more than 5000:

20A continuous is not that great for 26650, that's the same as most 18650's. There a lot of complaints about the Eon board because it's running 1P for 20A continuous and 40A for 2p.

Also are there any tests on these cells for capacity at 20A discharge?

20a is nothing amazing ..but enough for my build in 12s2p setup. But the capacity and the price is the winner here.

In terms of capacity these have been proven in several tests to do true 5000mah and more,  unlike many others 26650. If you know any other cells that keep 5000mah just let me know.

Thanks @NAF it's great to see new cells on the market that might work for esk8. Looking forward to seeing how they work out for you. When I see new cells for sale, the first thing I wonder is whether the label is presenting accurate information about capacity and discharge (which your links cover well, thanks!) 

The other is about the longevity. I think that there are cells that perform well out-of-the-box but don't last through the anticipated lifecycle. If these hold up well, it's an awesome deal. It's exciting to think that we could build a 10S3P 15,000mAh pack for $150usd!

Thats very much true. Most of the companies will "LIE TO THE FACE OF BABY JESUS" with their exaggerated claims about capacity and discharge. As much as I like this esk8 community I pretty much find much more information on batteries done by MOOCH from https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com  . He is doing some pretty amazing tests there.

@NAF yes it's true, the vaping community definitely does their homework when it comes to cells, I find myself unexpectedly at vaping forums pretty often for their battery reviews. Keep us posted once you've got your pack built.

I have bought 45 of those black littokala cells.
All cells had the same voltage when they arrived so that was good.
![IMG_20180813_212623|375x500](upload://jFGxCsbKiDQOjhcC1mn0qpM36c9.jpg) 
Did a quick test on my ownboard esk8, made a quick 10S1P pack.
Esc pulls max 18A so perfect to see how these perform and they worked great actually so no fake stuff.
If they were fake they couldn't be able to cruise for 10km so I know for sure they real.

Got 5V sag on max so that's normal, Lygte has some nice graphs made for every cell very intresting.
https://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/LiitoKala%20INR26650-50A%205000mAh%20(Black)%20UK.html

I have bought them from aliexpress from the official littokala store.

I'm going to keep these cells to make a 20S2P ebike battery.

You should actually have gotten something like 15-20km of range from a 10s5000mah pack, well I know I do on both my boards

I could do some more km but after 10km and going full throttle the remote started vibrating so it means the voltage drops below 32V.
Voltage after 10km was still 37V so that's just how the battery should perform if you check them on lygte.
They perform as good as the samsung 30Q.
![chrome|690x388](upload://GE5YZgHRljPSQP2wTvtuKWs7PX.png) 
You can see with a 10S1P setup you only get around 3Ah 'real' capacity.
A 10S2P will be perfect for those ownboard/wowgo/meepo esc's.

Your packs will have more discharge so that's normal. This was just a test pack, I won't never use a 10S1P with 18650 or 26850 cells :wink:

did some more calculations again to be sure my memory wasnt wrong.
The 21700 beats 26650 in every metric if you compare for example 10s3p to 10s3p.
1kg lighter, almost half the price and half the space needed, so you could increase the p count for the 21700 and still be lighter and have the same mAh/amps possible. 
I am rly excited to test this.

They're also twice as big, so they better perform twice as good and be less than twice the price for them to be usable...

also skeptical

well you can't rly beat the 30Q. The liitoKala lose in weight and space against the 30Q, but you pay extra for that performance. that is what it boils down to basicly. 
10s3p
21700 vs 30Q . 30Q needs 31% less space and 25% less weight but is 25% more expensive and has also 33% less capacity.
26650 vs 30Q. 30Q needs 212% less space and is 200% lighter, 66% lower capacity but 8% cheaper.
TLDR I remember again why i choose the 30Q instead of these. What you save in money once, you pay everday by having a heavier and bigger battery, you could just go 1 or 2 p up to get the same capacity and still be lighter and even have a higher Amp potential. BUY 30Q.
Edit: My calculation is based around that i don't pay import fees, so i need to buy smaller packages, more expensive.
Edit2: Had to correct some mistakes.

Yeah that's true VCT6 30Q and 40T are just the best but you pay for it.

If you wanna try a cheaper alternative I think the Littokala 26650 and 21700 are just pretty good choices to try, if you make sure to look at their tested max current :slight_smile:
Those 2 types can do around 15A - 20A so that will be safe for these.

I have bought from littokala oficial store.... all  fake....   looking at them looks good... but when you test them they are 1600 mah...

the problem is ... you can see a lot of videos and people... saying they are good....  and I had believe on that....  that was bullshit...  I just realised that are fake news...   waste my money on 60 bullshit cells... can't send them back because from US to china is more than 70 bucks... and also you have to sign saying that you are not shipping lithium batteries....   what a waste of time and money....  welcome to china trap...

the worst part is you contact the Liitokala guys... and they keep saying that they sell 3000mah batteries... you can send them many pictures and testing ... and they just keep saying  that are 3000mah .... and them you have to start a dispute... that is going to fail... because the shipping back to china is half of the price ... what a bullshit...
