Hopefully this can be answered easily. I currently have a single setup and want to convert it to a dual. Will there be an issue if I use VESCs from two companies? I currently have an ollin VESC but obviously can't get another......

You can use two different VESCâ€™s, I would just run the via split PPM

Or you could buy 2 new Focboxes and sell the Ollin vesc to someone building a single drive.
