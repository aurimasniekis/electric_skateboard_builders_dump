```
Prebuilt or diy?
18650 or lipo?

10s4p Samsung 30q always good.
Or get two 5s 5ah 60c lipos from hobbyking.

```
ty for your answer
before i will answer that I want too make sure that my motor choise is right.
Im looking for esk8 that will have allot of torqe for going over hills and max speed could be around 20-25 kmh-that will be enough.
That motor is right for my goals?
If it isn't what would be a right choise?
(I prefere hub motor because of the free wheels).
TY

And the space and the budget

Im in the planing stage- starting from a motor and battery and esc.
after that i will deal with all the rest of the build.
my budget is flexible but its around 500$-600$

If you look for some good hubs than go with this
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/review-and-eu-usa-group-buy-90mm-mad-hub-motors-75kv-or-130kv-dual-170-euro-1st-round-closed/62002/2?u=andy87

With good hubs you also need good esc...
So focbox, vesc etc. which easily can be already 200-300$
A good battery another 300$ min and with it you already over your limit.
You could go with a single hub ðŸ¤” that would safe you some money... but iâ€˜m not sure if this is what you want.

Sorry for that but I donâ€™t know so much about the quality of the budget esc and hubs.
But here quite some people who have a setup like you plan to have.
Maybe somebody can share some experience?
