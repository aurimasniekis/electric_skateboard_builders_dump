Now when the first Unity ships and a customer asks for it, let's see if they release that.  This is a fantastic start.  Being Legal, yeah!  Following the GPL license is FREE after all :smiley:  There is no reason whatsoever to break any copyright laws when it comes to GPL free and open source software :slight_smile:

@onloop, you deserve a big pat on the back

Don't worry, there is no chance I won't be releasing unity sources. Just need a breath of air where I can set up all the repositories properly. Will upload when units ship.
