Hey guys,

I've maidened my board and amazing by how fun it is to ride. No way I'll be taking it to top speed any time soon! 

Anyway I have a benchwheel remote linked to a maytech VESC. Take off is smooth and it holds speed really well. Possible problem I have is that if I blip the throttle or quickly increase the throttle then back off to 0 then the speed holds or continues to climb before coasting down to a stop. Maybe only a half a second delay. Almost feels like once you ask for x amount of power it has to reach that before it can roll off. 

Since this is my first board is a lag like this normal or is there something I can set in bldc?

No a lag isn't normal. Can you see this lag also on the display (App config. - PPM) of BLDC Tool? If there is also a lag, I think something is wrong with the remote/receiver.

I've got 3 Benchwheel remotes and I've never seen the before.  I think you have a bad remote.

Hummm I'll connect it up and see if I can replicate on film what is happening. It is most pronounced when the board it unloaded.
