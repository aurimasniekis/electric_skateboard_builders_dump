Found a new iteration of a hub motor. I've never seen such thick wires. I had read Vedder's article (http://vedder.se/2014/10/chosing-the-right-bldc-motor-and-battery-setup-for-an-electric-skateboard/)  but don't quote understand so I wanted to ask you all. What's the real advantages of this?

For starters, it looks cool!

Clean windings.

 thicker gauge wire, less turns, higher KV, higher current? Not entirely sure.

That's from the latest Mellow Board Kickstarter update

When you see a large number of thin wires most of them are actually placed in parallel and result in a motor with a higher fill factor (lower impedance for the same inductance ) resulting in a higher efficiency. Also for pwm frequencies higher then 4kHz isch the skineffect becomes an interesting factor as well -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect . For skineffect multiple small strands in parallel (litze wire) are beneficial as well.

That's funny... I was just reading this:
