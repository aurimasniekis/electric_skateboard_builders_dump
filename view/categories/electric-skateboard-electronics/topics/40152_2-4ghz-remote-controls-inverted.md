Hello, 

I recently paired my 2.4Ghz Remote:

And I found that the throttle does not start when I want it to. The throttle is when I push the trigger away from the body, instead of when I pull it towards the remote body.

Has anyone delt with this before? How do I switch the throttle and brake so the throttle is when I pull towards the body instead of away?

I can't see any settings in the vesc-tool for this.

Thanks!

You could swap the wires as they are soldered on the PCB.

I have a controller where the wheel was doing the throttle, not the trigger. Just swapped the "3-wires" for the wheel with the "3-wires" from the trigger.
