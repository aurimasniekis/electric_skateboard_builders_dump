Why avoid china?
Only avoid cheap shit and search for some with decent QC

That's so cool.  The compressed coil windings, they have in an 83mm diameter motor the power you'd normally get from over 100mm motor!  That would be great if they made these for Esk8.. Maybe a bit smaller and cheaper though, lol.
