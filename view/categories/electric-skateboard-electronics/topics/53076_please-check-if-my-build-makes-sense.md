Hi,

I thought about going for 10s2p **battery** with these **cells**, **bms**(60A version) and **charger**:

What do you guys think, it's right bms and charger for such setup? 

Then I wonder if I should go for some 2500W 6355 190kv single motor or for two of 1150W 5045 200kv ones (or maybe 140kv?) with 2 VESCs.
**single**:

**dual**:

or

And kinda want to go for second option but on this calculator:
[http://esk8.today/2016/12/28/how-far-can-i-ride/#rc](http://esk8.today/2016/12/28/how-far-can-i-ride/#rc)
I got 18km vs 12km range in favour of single motor. But if I were to go with these dual motors above (less W in 2x5045) won't I get better range with two small ones? Won't I improve it even more if I were to go for smaller with 140kv and bigger gear on the motor?

Thank you for your help

200kv is a bit high, but I would go for dual motor because of **braking**.  Not neccessarily because of range or efficiency but two motor braking is so much better than 1 motor braking.

The board isn't torquing to one side when you slam on the brakes and it isn't wanting to skid the wheel.
