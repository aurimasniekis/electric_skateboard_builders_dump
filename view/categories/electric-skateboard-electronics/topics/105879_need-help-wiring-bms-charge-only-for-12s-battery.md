Hello,

I am building a DIY trampa board and need some assistance. I am going to be buying 2x 6s LiPo batteries to sit inside a battery box. Thing is, I do not want to balance charge every time I need to charge my board. So in essence:

1: I need a guide on how to wire a BMS for charge only using 2x 6s LiPo batteries, effectively making it 12s.

2: I need to know the best way to attach the two batteries together so they run as 12s.


Thank you

Only thing different is that you will use charge only bms, connecting two lipos to bms is same as described
