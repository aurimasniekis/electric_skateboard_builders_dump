I saw ownboard sporting this...

This is for their hub motors.

Was wondering what's the name of these connectors, and more importantly whether or not there's a higher amp capable version of this out there...

I have an electric scooter that uses these.  I don't recommend them for esk8; they aren't very reliable and come loose too often

I’ve been thinking about using MT60s would be easy to move from one board to another. ![image|633x500](upload://pB9oJTqNvoYHtQy4efnB2ojABVS.jpeg)

I just bought these for the motor sensors, water resistant, automotive grade.

These are what the Racerstar motors, self-balancing scooters, and Evolve use.  These seem good if they can carry enough amperes.  They are a tight fit that doesn't seem to come undone easily

Yeah those screw lock 9 pin quick connectors look pretty ideal. I'm considering them for the Banshee.

I wish Amass made a 90-amp version of their 3-pin MT connectors, similar to their MT60s The 60s are just too small for my liking.

I have these connectors on my koowheel d3m gen 2. Don’t ask why I bought it.. ok I feel obligated anyways.. my raptor 2 got water damage, and all my diy and Carvon’s are boxed up cuz I moved.. and I needed something to ride and wasn’t bout to get an evolve or boosted. Anyhow, they are legit. Half the pins are longer than the rest. Dunno how I feel about them yet but way better than 3 separate plugs that can cause shorts. He triangular yellow connector that evolve uses always sparked my interest.

They are Higo/ AC solutions Z910

I looked to buy them or a cable with them but couldn’t find anywhere, they are perfect for sensores setups

Yea or maybe you can try EC5 package 3-pin 5mm bullet plugs instead ?

90A continuous connectors for the motors, no risk of short. Grease the plastic cover with silicon and seal the joints between cable and case. That'll do for a good water-resistant plug.
