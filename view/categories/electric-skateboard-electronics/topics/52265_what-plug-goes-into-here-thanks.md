Does anyone know which cable adapter I need that plugs into this focbox? It’s the one that doesn’t have anything plugged into it, thanks! ![image|375x500](upload://m9S9wOWQsthmVAmHw72jF6j7YOO.jpeg)

That is the UART header, it's for a Bluetooth modules or remote.

For the record, it is optional.  You don't have to connect anything there.

You need a JST 2.0mm 7-Pin PH. Such as [this one (UK)](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/10-Sets-JST-2-0mm-7-Pin-PH-Housing-Female-Connector-with-Wire-and-Male-Connector/322615498309?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649) [(USA)](https://www.ebay.com/itm/10-Sets-JST-2-0mm-7-Pin-PH-Housing-Female-Connector-with-Wire-and-Male-Connector/322615498309?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649). I haven't received mine yet so can't confirm 100% that it fits but 95% sure that's the right cable.

before you ask:

forget the resistors if your module can handle 5V

FYI. Battery monitoring via the BT app might, for some odd reason, be somewhat off compared to real values. 

Measure with a multimeter directly off your + and - so you know how much to add/subtract.
