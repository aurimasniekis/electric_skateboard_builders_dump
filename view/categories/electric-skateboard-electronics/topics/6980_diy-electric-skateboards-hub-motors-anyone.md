Hello I apologize if this has already been discussed but has anyone tried/reviewed Dexters/DIY Electric Skateboard hubs yet ?  Just wondering how they stack up against Hummies , Jacobs, and CarveOns.  Ride safely friends.

It will probably arrive late this week or early next week. All depends on how nice UPS feels about me.

The only thing I would recommend is to make sure you apply "medium threadlock" to the hub wheel bolts when you get them.

What thread lock would you suggest? And how is thread lock applied (forgive my sounding like an idiot, haven't worked with hub motors bfore)?

@kandmelinda - The hub motors are in stock.

The only trucks I have now are pretty beat up due to horrible shipping practices so It's $20 less for the current trucks. Save $20 bucks w/ the current kits. I have new trucks which should be available in 1-2 weeks.

@anorak234 - I only refer to the 6 bolts that hold the hub wheel. Due to the vibrations they may loosen but with threadlock they hold tight. Medium Threadlock should be good enough.

@Hummie - Just paris or round hanger type trucks. They should fit on Gullwing Sidewinders and most of the round trucks.
