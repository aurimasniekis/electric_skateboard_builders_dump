What are you guys using to wrap your electronics?, I'm getting a lot of rattling on my board due all components inside the enclosure, in order to avoid it I fixed the components with hot glue, but every time I open it for any repair, connecting the VESC with the PC, ot just check the balance of my batteries, it ends in a mess.

I'd like to leave all electtronics loose but cover inner of the enclosure with some kind of soft sponge or foam.

I was thinking in this product:

I like 3m "dual lock" velcro for securing them inside the enclosure - and a bit of thin foam to avoid rattling if needed.  Still able to pull/swap components and be secure.

The only bad thing about velcro is that it's flammable.

What do people use to wrap the batteries with before the heat wrap, I've seen padded battery packs, really nice feel and very protective against shocks.

What I do is attach batteries, bms and receiver to the bottom of my deck with either servo tape or heavy duty velcro and then the enclosure just covers everything. It has worked well for me so far. No rattling and nothing ever comes loose.
For my vescs I use a section of a lipo tray bolted to the deck with a buckle velcro strap to hold the vesc in place.

I tape all components with dual sided foam tape in the bottom of enclosure and then i glued 6mm thick neoprene between my deck and enclosure.

im covering things like battery in 2mm thick felt sheets for shock protection, then shrink wrap just about anything and fixate the components finally with some dbl sided adhesive tape in the enclosure!

i lined the bottom of my enclosure with this stuff, and then another on top of everything before mounting to the board.

the anti-slip properties keeps stuff from moving around, and it's spongy so has some level of shock absorption too.

Shrinkwrap my electronics and batteries + thin adhesive foam layer boardside + heavy duty Velcro to keep everything attached to the enclosure + hot glue to keep my LCD, ports and switches in place.

Here's a thought I just had, would love to hear some input.

Has anyone tried using command strips so secure stuff?

EDIT: you'd want to secure them to the enclosure, not the deck I think

I don't see any reason why command strips wouldn't work. I prefer velcro because I can keep moving stuff around. With all the rearranging I did, I'd have gone through a box of command strips.

Sure that makes sense. Command strips would get very expensive.

I use flight box no flammable foam which you can cut to the shape of your components and 'squish' in.

You don't need anything that thick. 1/8" is pretty ideal for padding electronics without taking up too much space. I get mine off Ebay. Usually less than $2 per foot + a few $ for shipping for 1/8"X4" or 1/8"X6" for however long you need. You can lay a sheet down on your board and on your enclosure so your electronics are sandwiched between. The stuff does not come off easily, so I suggest leaving most of the backing on and only exposing the adhesive along the edges. That way if you ever want to remove it, it's less of a chore.

That's a really small sheet, you will have to get at least 6 of them to cover the topm bottom and wrap electronics

Guys...  Not knocking, but Velcro shouldn't be your concern - li-ion or lipo has much more flammability... in a wood deck... with hot electronics in it...  epoxy and CF/GF and all sorts of plastics...  I appreciate being cautious when it comes to fire, but i'd not worry about the velcro myself!  

But it never hurts to be cautious.  I'd like to think the board i build is better quality with quality and safer components vs. the lowest priced components in a chinese hoverboard that catches on fire while riding!

Charging is one area where i'm much more concerned w/ flamability - simple to fix w/ lipo bags or even cheap used pyrex dishes to charge in.  Even better to add a temp probe to stop charging if gets hot!

YMMV and do what you want to be as safe as you need!

I tried velcro today, took it off right away, I hated it, a lot.

It was impossible to move the electronics, to put them in the correct place, I had to pull the battery with such force I stripped several cables and a couple of connectors from the BMS, fuck velcro!, I'm going with adhesive neoprene foam

I'd suggest an adhesive neoprene, however you can always glue it

I have stuck self adhesive Velcro to the deck and same on my lipos. Then I'm closing it off with enclosure.

I did that a while back, it was a mess, the velcro will stick harder than the glue on the deck, it'll be a PIA to move the batteries, I removed the velcro right away, inspections and diassembling were horrible jobs to perform.

I have taken batteries few times off now and it's seems to be fine. Haven't driven with Velcro yet as all day was raining here in London :/
