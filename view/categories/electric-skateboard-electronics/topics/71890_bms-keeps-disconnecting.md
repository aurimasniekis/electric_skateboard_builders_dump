I am having a problem with my freshly build electric skateboard, my battery setup is 10s 3p and my BMS is a cheap chinese 10s 60a one from aliexpress, see it [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10S-13S-36V-48V-40A-60A-Lithium-Battery-Protection-Board-Electric-Bicycle-eBike-with-Balance-equalization/32888307335.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.12c74c4dNsbDaN). My problem is that when the board has been standing for a while the bms just stops sending power out from p-, but when connect b- and p- directly it suddenly works again for a while until it stops working again. I dont know if i have to buy a new bms or something. Any help is appreciated.

what do you mean for a "while"

it could be that it turns off after some time when current isnt passing thru
you could ask the seller also

Well, i don't think it's because of that. In the start it didn't really do it but after about two days it began doing it more and more.
