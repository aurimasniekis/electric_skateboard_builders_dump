You didnt mention if you are runniny 6s or 12s...probably 12s am I rgiht? with 6s you would ahve quite low max speed :)
for 6s your max speed will be quit low: http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":1,"batt-cells":6,"motor-kv":149,"system-efficiency":90,"motor-pulley-teeth":15,"wheel-pulley-teeth":36,"wheel-size":83}|
for 12s:

The motor has no 3mm shaft for key. If you buy the pulley system from enertion you will have to cut on side of a hanger on the trucks to fit it (or you can buy 1 narrow truck and one normal for front wheels: http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/narrow-hanger-truck-use-with-wheel-pulley/)
```

yeah I was going to buy the narrow and normal tucks, but what do you mean by the shaft key? Is that what you need for the smaller wheel to fit?

no, the turnigy has a round shaft so if you put a pulley with a round hole on it, it wont hold in place = it wont transmit the power of motor...thats why the enrtion motor pulley has the smole square hole in it (http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/12mm-wide-drive-pulley-kit/) as you can see on the black motor pulley...then tere is a small iron block you put inside the pulley, but there must also be a hole in the motor shaft, so the block fits between motor pulley and shaft of the motor...it "connects" the motor pulley with the shaft....ASUFHAOiufnh I cant speak English that well to explain this :D :D I hope u get it, if not I will send you some pictures to explain that :D

shaft key is the small thing you put between Motor pulley and shaft of the motor :)

The Enertion motor pulley has a slot, where you put a shaftkey in, which you´ll also need on your motor shaft. This keeps your motor pulley on your motor shaft.
SK3 motors do have normal shafts without a keyway, so if you want that technique, you have to file down one side of the motor shaft. You´ll find a tutorial around somewhere here for that.
The other option is to glue your pulley to your motorshaft with 648 loctite. That´s what lot´s of people are doing.

The programming is really easy :) guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkqrZTeoQuk&list=PLICpQdAXJazT-ICMIgJuc2pl-w0-j1j9A
VESC-x should be good, but if you want to spend some money, you can go for Maytech VESC (cheap, chinese, sometimes comes without frimware - then you have to really programm it and that sucks) or DIY's (they would have to ship it from the USA, but it is quite cheap and still reliable)
IDK if there are any autralian vendors except enertion, maybe you could get one used from someone on this frum :slight_smile:

Buying from somebody on here is a good idea, I just really don't want to spend $200 on a vesc, I still don't understand what the difference between a good and bad vesc/esc is

Depending on your timeline, enertion may not be the best bet.  They have been taking up to two months to ship diy parts.

Ok, so the Good VESC supports FOC (field oriented control) which can give you more torque and really silent ride (quiet motors) it comes  fully functional, tested and with no bad joints, everything is connected as it should be.

Bad VESC might come without firmware, it is not tested (so it can blow up after few rides), it doesnt support FOC...

But generally VESCs are solid, if you watch and read all the guides and you dont make a mistake, then you should be OK :)

Yep, I am using the same VESC, it is good, but you can't run it in FOC (quieter, smoother) just in BLDC...sometimes it happen that it comes without uploaded firmware, which is annoying :/ Make sure it is uploaded (ask their support), also ask them to declare smaller price of the parcel so you wont have to pay customs and taxes (if you have to pay them in your country)

FOC is field oriented contorl...what does it mean? The VESC controls the motor differently, which leads to slightly bigger torque and really quiet ride (the motor make barely a sound)

If you look at the item description on the VESC here: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Maytech-Benjamin-Vedder-Electronic-Speed-controller-VESC-for-electric-longboard-/302200711613?hash=item465c90e9bd:g:tRkAAOSwiDFYPFHa
it says hardware version 4.12 and firmware version 2.18. does that mean it not updated
```

## \#29 Posted by: aigenic Posted at: 2017-05-11T10:25:02.403Z Reads: 47

It should be ok I guess :) From what I reember I run my VESC on the same firmware...what I meant is that it sometimes has NO firmware (like they completely forgot to upload it), but then you can return it for a good one :)

Ok here's my issue, I want to order this vesc (seems to have the best pricing I can find): https://psychotiller.com/product/50a-maytech-vesc 
but I will cost me $40 ship it to Aus. Is there any other way I can get my hands on one? e.g. someone here buys it new, I buy it off them for something like $5 extra and pay for them to ship it to Aus (for a much cheaper price than $40). I know its dodgy and its cool if nobody can do it, just an idea

Well I have never ordered anything, beacuse the price they offerd wasn't good enough...you find the thing you like and then you contact the supplier asking how much would that and that do...he usually tells you to send an email to for example orders@maytech.cn including what you want and your adress...they will send you paypal information, price, you pay that and you are done...in few days/weeks you get your parcel and everyone is happy :) Thats how it works from what I know :)
