Hey there!! As the title says I’m looking for someone who knows exactly how to assemble a battery located in EU, I’m based in Italy! I have a TRAMPA build and I’m using the nese modules on top, they are simply amazing... but I don’t like at all the look of the battery on top. My cells are pretty much brand new, I wonder if there is anyone nearby Italy who can do a 10s6p battery to sit in a TRAMPA underboard battery tray with a bypassed BMS.
Thanks in advance for any hints!
Edit: forgot to mention, I’ll pull around 80A and the battery should have the flex needed For a TRAMPA

I'm looking for a builder who would do a small LiPo setup for me, including wiring in the switch and a LCD display in a particular way so I can fit them in my enclosure. I'm based in the UK, if there's anyone around here?
