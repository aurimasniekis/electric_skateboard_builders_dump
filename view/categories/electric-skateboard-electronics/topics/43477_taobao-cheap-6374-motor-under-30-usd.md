Hi all,

Have anyone tried these motors from China? https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.257.2e3fef8a263m8O&id=560355109681&ns=1&abbucket=20#detail

The price is good and I wonder if the motors are ok. Any thoughts?

For 30$ buy it for science and post the results here!

They probably cheaped out on the coils a lot

Yeah! it's pretty cheap and I will probably give a try on it, but it would be nice to know if anyone went through with it and what are their impressions.

My friend has 2 of those small red ones, they cant handle alot of amps and mainly used for kit boards with a maxium draw of around 20 amps.

They work great, good option if  your limited to a small 10s2p battery.

I have them here and i can tell you im quite disappointed. A customer of mine had a burned motor on his pennyboard and he used one of these. The motor had a max speed of 12mph. I guess the bright side is hes faster than walking.

I can do that with regular pushing no electricity needed... At those speeds may as well use a regular push board.

They seem to look pretty similar to the maytech motors.
