I am really hard on my setup not from misuse but pure shredding and I have had torqueboards 190 kv motors just wondering if their is a higher quality motor as I have went through like 4

The SK3 motors are always going to be much favorite motor

my setup is faster than most I would imagine and I literaly am doing 40 mph everywhere I go and if im not going forty im in a powerslideor hitting a driveway or .....well yopui get the point I treat it like it costed 50
$$and not a lot more but it is abuse that needs to happen

I have those motors and they seem pretty good. What happens to them that they go bad? They break, bearings go bad, overheating or something like that?

These are precision motors with 10mm shafts.
I've been using them for a while and they are holding together well for me.

I have a couple TBs 190kv motors and they're good to go. If you're geared for 40+mph then you're probably running extremely hot going up steep/long hills. If so, this isn't a motor quality issue, it's a system design issue. Have you blown through any vescs yet?

you would think but really oddly enough Ive been shredding religiously every day for a year solid and honestly ive never not been able to put the back of my hand on the motors after gnarly hill climbs . I have burned through four or five vescs but eversince I swithched to the vesc-x I have had absouloutly no vesc issues . not  sure why correct me if im wrong or not but why would you ever choose the standard vesc over vesc-x . ?
its so much more durable and user friendly

Vesc-x is much better than overrated vesc v4.x..  what's your setup single motor, dual motor, 6355, 6374?

yeah the 90mm 81A slide well once broken in. I have a few sets in different duros.  I used them on my downhill speedboard for years

Your "fish" is growing a bit.  Haha I don't mean to call you out, but I gotta call BS on your 40mph "everywhere you go"

 12S @ 190kv, 18:36 @ 90mm can't do 40mph with a person on it, unless you're going downhill, or have found a way to circumvent the laws of physics

has it at 43 theoretical with 80% efficiency. 

Maybe he's not actually doing 40 everywhere, but he's probably damned close most of the time. Especially if he's jockey weight.

Yeah, 43 sitting upside-down on the bench without a load  

I did the calculation too. Top speed will be around 35mph or less.  Not trying to argue; I was curious because a true 40mph is no easy feat on an e-skate

Based on your other thread you seem to have figured out that our recommendation would have been dual 6374 motors lol. The only way to fit them on standard caliber trucks is diagonally. Also be aware these motors are heavy, but if you are overheating things I don't see another option.

If you use nominal voltage for your calculations then those numbers will be pretty accurate in real world. Using the same setup as him but instead using 15/36 I got a top speed of 35mph. Using 18/36 should break 40mph

Thank you. 

Using nominal voltages and about 80% efficiency on those calculators seems to reflect what i've actually been able to do on the street and i'm 155 pounds on the board, not on the bench.

## \#23 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2017-04-26T19:08:48.994Z Reads: 128

```
actually i just built a 190kv 12S board on 97mm flywheels with a 15/35 ratio which reflects a theoretical max of 39.9mph at 80% efficiency and my apps had it bouncing off of 40 during street testing so i'm pretty sure i have figured out how to tune that calc to my own weight just by using the efficiency setting. 

 also i was using my own motors for this not that it really matters. Well it matters to me, i like my motors.

How do the motors break?  Probably the windings are shorting from vibrations and the magnets are fine.  If you first cover the windings ain a "conformial" coating, glue, and glue the leads solid as they come out of the motor in the future I bet it's good. 
I'm in sf but only hit 30!

As soon as somehow 50.4 volts gets applied to my battery I'll meet.  Want you to try my board tell me what u think.  I'll be winding the motors in the future and it's a gamble what kv they end up so maybe 40 mph will happen, or I could shoot for 40 if someone wanted. 

  Im broke for real and waiting for my supply to come in the mail so can't ride. Raining now anyway.  If u have a loaner or for sale (to be paid later!) laptop 48 volt supply anyone in sf I'll make it worth ur trouble.

I got mine from SDP-SI. They have every size you could want.  Plus you can even download the 3D models

My new drivetrain will have a 18T or 20T motor pulley to 34T wheel pulley. Currently running a 1:2 ratio (16:32), but I need more speed and less torque
