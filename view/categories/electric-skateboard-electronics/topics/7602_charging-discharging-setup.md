Ok so the picture should speak for itself. My goal is to simplify the charging without a BMS. I am charging the batteries separately at 6s with an iMax B6 and connecting them in series for 12s when discharging. I figure I can make a small jumper between the middle two bullet connectors when riding, then unplug the series connector and anti sparks to the vesc to charge individually. I didn't draw the balance connectors but I will have them.

My first attempt at a DIY enclosure, turned out ok
