ive seen higher power ones too.  

I imagine I'd find a 13 prong plug for all the balance wires of my 12s pack and have 12 of these in a box all connecting to another 13 prong plug.  why wouldnt I want to do this?  seems a simple cheap and safe balance charger.

my ebike buddy made a 80 single cell charger with a metric fuckton of these units.

He charges each single single before building a pack... i'll ask him for a picture

This way you will not really balance charge a whole pack just each cell individually

if he has any advice I'm interested how he hooks up the power source.  I imagine a phone charger wouldn't put out the amps needed. @Acido  I think I'll have to get a high amp and low voltage power supply too.  a fuckton of these is cheaper than a 12s balance charger ..as it's not even available

do I want a supply that puts out more than all the little modules all added together, or do I want the modules to be able to put out more than the supply?  I'm guessing I want a higher power supply than the modules.

i purchased a bunch of tp4056's for cheap from china(ebay).  I have all these old phone batteries that  are 3.7v 2000mah plus so i wired them to a bunch a stuff (flash lights/remotes/rc remotes/bluetooth speakers/etc) and use the tp4056 to charge them.  In my experience, i feel like they charge at 1 amp which isn't great but serves my purposes.  I made a 4 battery 18650 sled that was wired to one of these but it took a while to charge 4 Sammy 25r's for obvious reasons.

they make higher amp versions.  be a nice single plug solution if I could get it up to maybe ...8 amps I'd be happy.  don't see any 8amp single lipo chargers out there though.  5 or even 4 amps I'd do it.  hard to come back from blasting a pack with 9amps

I would not go too crazy on the charge current, 1-2A is probably the max you can go through the balance leads (safely)

Have you tried charge only BMS and a laptop style charger before and didn't like it?

Got BMS for $25 from forum member. 6amp charger for $100, also can get 4amp charger for $85 or saw 10amp for $130

I use a 50v adjustable power supply now and I'll balance on the side with a "discharge balancer" and it works but would like a single plug option where everything is external from the board.
  I got an 8amp 50v for 60$ with a led screen and knob.    I have a couple different ones but that was the cheapest.  

how about 12 of these?

paired with a 5 v supply that does...(12x3 amps)...36 amps?

but I need to be reminded: how come I wont end up with a bunch of shorts if I hook 12 of these to a power supply and then to all my cells that are already in series?

Why wouldn't you connect to BMS like this and use your power supply if it is cc/cv?

You won't be able to use these unless you have a 26 pin plug for them to connect to. This is because these charger need the two wires to connect to each cell but bms' and balance charger only have one wire in between each cell so unless you can find a way to connect it up like that this won't work. And even then in my head it feels like the whole thing would short out because the positive of one little board would need to be connected to the negative of another since your cells are connected together. BUT FOR SCIENCE...


Edit: That sounded a lot simpler in my head lol

yea I think connecting to a charging only bms sounds simpler.  I have a couple of these coming:

could I wire the batteries so that they connect to a plug and that plug would just connect to this off the board?  that sounds ideal.  that way I could bulk charge as normal with all 12s in series and then plug this thing in to balance sometimes.  No?

STOP! This won't work! I've seen people try to do this before but because the cells are all connected in series unless the individual chargers are isolated the voltage keeps increasing and the TP modules die. Wish this would work but it doesn't sorry! Unless your talking about a bunch of individual cells alone and charging them individually like @Blasto mentioned, nope.

No linerar are still non isolated you'd need to use 12 ground isolated PSU's and at that point it's gonna be easier to just use a BMS lol.

can you sum up for me why a linear supply wouldn't be isolated?  I've been researching and my understanding is very minimal.  I thought linear supplies were just like transformers and I assumed all transformers were isolated as they have two coils which are physically separated.    the more long-winded with sidetracks the better.

and what of @Quezacotl thing above where he uses even switching supplies all connected to one power source and one big battery in series I believe
```

## \#30 Posted by: JdogAwesome Posted at: 2017-11-22T02:25:56.061Z Reads: 89

```
From what I understand they are not isolated at all though I could be wrong. Also it doesn't matter if they are because even at only 5V 1A the modules are going to get very hot and super inefficient. And @Quezacotl seems to be using isolated individual power supplies and still it seems very un reasonable and defeats the purpose of this all together.

Why not put a charge only BMS in the charger and use mini USB-C for charger-battery connection, usb-c natively does 100W, it's 24 pins allowing for up to 10S using 2 pins per S, with 2pins per main lead, or 12s using single pin and plenty left over for main leads

I can think of two pretty good reasons

 1. So there is more space in the enclosure

2. One bms can charge multiple different batteries

Db15 for testing

A usb-c mini port can replace the balance connector, so all you have is usb-c to usb-c

I feel like then it'll make more sense to use a normal hobby grade balancer because of the better balance current and ability to change cell count. Also on the connector side it's just more stuff that could go wrong, I prefer my GX16 connector on the side if my board and that's it.

but where you going to find a 12s balance charger if that's what you're talking about?  the few I've ever seen aren't available and crazy expensive.

this is off the board so less abusive and less likely to break is a big plus.  and more room in the board as said.

Good point forgot about the 12S balance charger rarity lol. And BMS's usually aren't very big and can fit on top of the batteries or somewhere else that's not in the way. Less abuse on the BMS, well yeah maybe but I really think the BMS is the last thing that's going to break from abuse, your VESC is gonna die far before lol. Though I guess it depends from board to board.

I've already done it...

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/temporary-charging-balancing-solution/27266?u=darkkevind

If you want one power supply though you have to use DC - DC isolators on each TP4056 otherwise you get a short...

Would you be able to post a wiring diagram, I think I understand but I'm not 100% sure. Would it work if you were to wire the boards in series or would that also cause a short? That way you could charge with a 40v power supply
```

---
## \#46 Posted by: darkkevind Posted at: 2017-11-22T10:24:29.027Z Reads: 68

```
You can't wire them in series with 40v because each TP4056 needs 6v max, so 40v will fry any that you have in series.
You can however wire them in series with 5v power supply that can discharge at 8A or more as it's the A draw that matters here... But this is then where you need DC-DC isolators (About £2 on ebay) on each one to isolate the power source, otherwise the single power source creates a short.

I thought it worked differently as in say with leds each is 3v max if you put two in series you could use 6v to power them and so on. Does it not work the same with these modules?

Just remembered if you going to charge a battery pack through balancer leads with multiple chargers connected you will have a problem, because between cells its not real ground, its + of cell before and those small chargers have B- connected to ground so if you have multiple chargers your going to shorten the circuit
