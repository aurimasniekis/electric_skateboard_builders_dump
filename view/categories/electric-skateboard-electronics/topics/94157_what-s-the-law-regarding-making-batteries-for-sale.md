Is it just related to shipping or what.   I know a lot of people make complete batteries here.

Shipping is the hard part, domestic us shipping can be done if the pack is under 100wh without getting a hazmat label.

For large batteries, most people just slap a sticker on it saying anything under 100wh and the post service is none the wiser

Not to be a downer, but as a former fire-fighter and a current pilot, just think of the carriers (truck drivers, pilots, ships) and in the case of an incident, the emergency responders. There might be someoneâ€™s family memberâ€™s lives at risk.

Everybody loves hamburgers but nobody wants to know where the meat comes from! :roll_eyes:

Evolve, Metroboard, Baja, Enertion, Boosted, etc, etc, etc...send their full fledged battery driven electric vehicles half across the world with at least 50% batt capacity, no? Aren't those less dangerous?? Anybody complaining about how they manage to send those across the globe?

You also have to have a hazmat label with a "more info" number to call on it. If you dont pick up on the first attempt, you get a 75k fine. Hobbyking rents out insured call centers for example.

Thankfully, a 10s4p pack is very close to 100wh when at shipping charge. I dont feel bad violating a law if i am extremely close to the target goal.

I dont know if this counts when  using a storage charge, but it should. At a storage charge i torture tested cells in brutal ways including smashing them flat without breaking the casing or cutting them in half with an axe. I have never had a storage charge cell get too hot to hold once destroyed. They let out the smallest bit of smoke and thats it.

ðŸ¤” whaaaaaat? ðŸ¤” 4x3,6x10x3= 432 ðŸ¤” ok itâ€™s relativ close to 100Wh if you compare it how close a 20s20p pack is to 100Wh ðŸ™Œ

@Hummie you asking about international shipping? 
I donâ€™t know if laws changed but if you sent battery packs via ground service national (or in EU around the EU) I donâ€™t know of any restrictions so far. There shouldnâ€™t be a Wh limit as well. Just donâ€™t ship air freight.


Edit: I think it also depends on the country but you should definitely have a disclaimer or something people need to agree with that use is on own risk. Nkon for example requires to confirm that you know that batteries are dangerous and use is on own risk when you want to check out. Itâ€™s there way to be not responsible if somebody fuck up something and try to claim itâ€™s fault of the seller.

I am talking about a storage charged pack. At that voltage, each cell contains about 3wh of energy left. That's why i said it may not count but it should. Its also why i mentioned the torture tests of discharged cells. The lithium is less and less reactive the more the voltage drops.

I calculate that with 3.6v which is the nominal voltage and usually used to calculate the pack size specifically if people speak about certification of packs you canâ€™t take a value you want to. Storage voltage is usually 3.4-3.5V and the voltage you get cells shipped if you buy them.

Even if you calculate that for 2.5V per cell which is the total minimum I would get with a 18650cell itâ€™s still 300Wh for a 10s4p pack.

At 3.4v, it contains only about 20% of its max power at that point, if each cell is 3wh or so based on various discharge graphs, that puts a 10s4p pack at 120wh at that voltage. At 2.5v per cell the total energy remaining is less than 1% of its total energy. You can literally cut into one at that point with almost no reaction.

I am interested in this too. Had some awesome battery samples sent to me, 10s3p 60A bms with e switch, but I am not able to handle the shipment. It was 250euro just to send the 3 units from China, so it is too expensive as well to ship them.

To ship batteries with dhl without certificate first the battery needs to be shipped via ground to a company that packs them in some special packaging and they charge 100 eur per battery, at least in Croatia and after that they can be shipped with an airplane to wherever it needs to go

The best advice is to talk to a sales rep for the carriers to find out what you need to do. It might take a little bit of time to talk to the right person, but once you do tell them what you want to ship and what you need to do.

If you tell them you're starting a business and plan to make a lot of expensive shipments soon then they are interested to help get you an account and save you money.

Post office can also help, but it is even harder to get someone to help.

Finally there are ALL SORTS of 3rd party logistics solutions providers that can solve ALL your problems. Like others mentioned in the thread, you can just find a company where you dump all your batteries too and they worry about packing it and making the certifications. That is the easiest but it is also the most expensive.

Trying to figure out all of the regulations and certifications is nearly impossible to do by yourself. Use the resources of the business you are going to ship with.

You can also get quotes for how much everything will cost. (Not the certifications, but they can point you in the right direction)

The 100Wh limit is for one electrically connected unit aka. a battery. If you ship smaller single batteries this limit is different. 

DHL has a detailed shipping guide regarding lithium batteries: 
https://www.dhl.com/en/express/shipping/shipping_advice/lithium_batteries.html#guides_materials

Most of the time packages with larger batteries are stored in fireproof compartments on trucks and planes. <sup>[citation needed]<sup>

i know what the limits are lol. i have shipped quite a few batteries already. for how i do it legally, or mostly legally, i have to be at 100wh total limit and the box it required to not state it has lithium cells. (its strange)

the only thing you have to do is put "ground ship only" on the outside if you are using USPS domestic only shipping (flatrate)

You can also ship them as is with an easy little trick to qaulify. Just label it as a external laptop charger because is basically is one. Some high end gaming laptops accept the high voltage and unlimited amperage and limit it inside. It is its own device at that point, just label it as not included plastic enclosure. 

Its a shady method i have seen used several times. I do it as well but i have never shipped a pack that contains for than 130wh at most.

Not true, lithium reacts with air, causing fizzy reaction

100wh rating only applies to airlines believe.

The carrier does not care how much lithium you ship (unless your shipping tens of pounds of cells) all they pretty much care about is you legally shipping it.

For instance a carrier may not even let you ship 1 18650 cell.

Heck when ninebot Segway's distributor shipped 374wh worth of lithium in my scooter to me they didn't even have a label. (Shipped to me via UPS Ground)

Also lithium is counted as "dangerous goods" so no international shipping unless via boat or ground.

I just realized this post isn't actually necessarily about shipping but the legalities of producing and selling the pack and being authorized or protected in doing so.

I actually think you are OK if you are just selling the pack. The problem comes if you sell a product with the pack AND the charger. So, my understanding of this is basically you can do whatever you want. However, if you want to get business liability insurance in case someones house burns down while charging your board, they will likely require you to have various kinds of certification. Probably ISO9001 at the very least, which is showing that all of your tasks are documented how to perform them and you have a documented quality control procedure in action. But there may be some related specifically to battery packs. They may also require your configuration of battery and charger together be UL certified.

If you just want to put it for sale, for in the USA, I do not think you are restricted you just should consider to protect yourself against liability. Having a disclaimer goes a long way, but having insurance protects you in the case anything goes wrong you don't have to pay for a lawyer with your own money.

Selling into europe is a totally different story and I'm not sure about that. I think you need more certifications to sell power electronics.

By the way, if there are laws about how fast a skateboard can go that would also fall into this category.

I'll probably get flamed up and down for this post saying "you're crazy you don't need it I've had a business without liability protection". Sure, you can do it, but it's a risk. Just make sure it's a calculated one.

At the absolute very least you should form a business of some kind. LLC is very cheap, and this protects anyone from going after your house and home for anything that goes wrong in the business.

[/quote]

Getting UL certified requires a lot of parts for testing around 20 samples. (All they do is do stupid shit with your battery, like water and intentional impact testing and protection features) so basically like @longhairedboy ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

It would not be worth it for small scale.

That's not how you calculate the remaining energy potential in a battery. You need to integrate the area of the discharge characteristics curve for a given cell.

How does a discharged 10s4p pack at 3.4v per cell have 300wh? That makes no sense. I linked the site above where you can clearly see the remaining energy at a certain voltage.


There is a reason you dont discharge lithium too low. The last amount of energy stored, lets say 3.2v is so small that if hooked up to a board, it will drain literally volts per second until the esc cant run anymore.

I did say almost no reaction. What experience do you have with this that i dont exactly? I know how they work and i know how reactive they are. I cut one in half with an axe (sont vtc5 and 30qs) at 3.52 volts each which is the charge nkon.nl ships them at. Even at 3.5 the reaction never went above 280 degrees Fahrenheit. There wasnt even a spark from it. The only result was a small amount of smoke that was barely visible. Of left on thermal camera for several hours even after being smashed, cut, or shredded, the cells cooled down at a rate signifying the reaction was complete after only about 1 minute.

I suggested @hummie to look at battery manufacturers that will be willing to certify the battery for you, and design the battery to spec. Yeah it's a little more expensive but it also solves this problem. (Sorta, once it's assembled and sold with a charger, the entire setup should be certified)

Ultimately, forming a business protects yourself, getting liability insurance protects the business, getting the certification protects your customers.

i cant even begin to say how incorrect that statement is. you are saying that a pack that is completely dead beyond safe repair still contains a whopping 300wh???  please dont come and disagree with people on a subject you very clearly do not understand. that has to be right up there with people asking if they can mix different size lipos to make a higher cell count for cheaper lol

he would have to pay tens of thousands to have them certified. it would just be cheaper if you are a small operation to buy the ridiculously expensive hazmat label  and ship the packs that way. i have looked into it and it would cost me the price of atleast 20 assembled units of each configuration and then anywhere between 10k and 60k to have them tested and certified. i didnt get a more detailed quote because it was clearly not an option for someone like me who only sells a few now and then

from my reading many of the manufacturer data sheets on many of these ion cells we use they will do many abusive tests and they always pass and not turn to a fire but the variable they don't include is when you have MANY cells together and the heat will multiply and then you can have a fire

but maybe more practically what are you guys doing to ion packs to allow flex.   every battery manufacturer ive contacted, and also I think enertion, have completely spot welded packs and no point to bend.   I can spot weld and then add multistrand wire for flex but that's a lot of work and trying to find somewhere that would do it or a better method.   evolve have their new thing which seems really nice with it's flexablity and seems to solve it.  and need to find a good bms to include.   the rest of the complete board is figured except the battery and bms.   I don't want to make them.   I think it's really important though with the risks of getting fake cells are crappy bms and the possibility of fire

i know what you mean with exponential heat build up. while i have only tested 2 cells at a time for this and submerged them in perlite as an insulator, the temperature had no substantial difference, especially at low voltage. I would like to test a full pack someday maybe if i find a trash one i will.

for an ordinary 10s4p pack, the flex is minimal since it is so short. i do recommend you dont get an overly tight enclosure so you can let the ends of the pack rise or fall a few millimeters if necessary during board flex. if the pack is any bigger than a 10s4p or it is custom ordered, then I dont weld p groups but instead tin the nickel with a 120w soldering iron and instantly get solder on it (less than 1 second of heat) then i solder 10 or 8 awg silicone wire across the p groups. its very strong and has as much flex as you want. the real limiter at that point is the heatshrink over it all. it constricts movement a fair bit
