If im hooking up two 6s packs in series for a 12s setup and want battery monitors on each pack would this be the correct way to set up?

Yes that should be fine.
Just make sure the two monitors you have can be configured for 6s packs.

Cool, thanks! Also building on that, I'm looking for a good way to switch between a series configuration attached to the VESC and a parallel config hooked up to a charging port. As far as I can tell the only good way to accomplish this is by using 2x DPDT switches toggling each pack between a series or parallel adapter. Unless anyone can recommend a good 4PDT switch for this application?

Check out @Dunkirk 's build (http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vanguard-orange-10s-sk3-i-vesc/1337) He made a pretty clever solution to charge in parallel but discharge in series.
