Can I just plug in the 5 pin JST into the 6 pin JST on the focbox?

No. The missing pin is the temp pin which is in the middle not on the top. You would be missing the positive pin which you need. To fix this, get a 6 pin connector and just skip over the temp wire

Yeah I really don't like how the foc box is set up like that. Also check the pcb not the sticker for wiring.

Do just move the red wire one pin down?

I believe so. Make sure you do your motor detection before running your motors.
