Alright, so who is building and selling custom batteries?  What are your prices?  I have been trying to build my 10s3p battery, but the spot welds keep popping off.  I don't think my setup is powerful enough.  I am just tired of working on the battery and would like to get it done.  If I can provide the cells, do you have an idea of what the price would be?  I'm also considering just doing a 12s4p battery, so what would be your price for that?  Thanks!

Got a 10S3P 30Q pack + switch + led kit for $350. Haven't had much time to test the pack, but communication was :100:

I can vouch for @barajabali ... His pack has been serving me great for a little while now. I want to go ride it, right now!

Definitely agree, @hyperIon1  communication is top tier and customer service is definitely at the top of anyone else here, especially after dealing with a couple of vendors on the forum with no responses and shady practices.  As well as his battery is standing up well on my board at the moment.  

Also, a buddy has a battery from Baja, and it has been legit for over a year.
