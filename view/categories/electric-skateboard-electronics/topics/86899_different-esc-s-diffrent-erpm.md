Hi everybody

I saw on the forum and on the web, many differents kinds of esc from rc to eskate, and i saw diffrents ERPM limits, so my question is:

Which are the hardware components in a esc, that allow you to reach higher ERPM?

At the moment,  which is the highest ERPM ever tested?

The best ESC for a stupid high ERPM would be either the unity from enertion or the vesc 6 from trampa.

The unity was tested at 130000erpm, and the vesc 6 could likely put similar numbers down, if not better due to the different design.


Also just search this stuff up, it's been spoken about, debated and proven many many times

Unity: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/changing-foc-switching-frequency/30928/155?u=sn4pz

I found a post claiming the vesc 6 doesn't actually have a maximum erpm value.... But I think that's hooey. Maybe it's so high we'll never get to it... But I think the value should still be outlined by the manufacturer :face_with_monocle:
