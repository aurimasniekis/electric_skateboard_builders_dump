Hi there!
I just got a wonderfull little orange focbox unity to take the place of my old esc.
I'm blocking at a basic point and it feels really stupid :this is my old controllers 7 wires connectic, and the small 3 wires cable is what enertion is giving me (![%40%40%40Receiver|281x500](upload://pozkCClpmMWP7YYQNocJJukSQYD.jpeg) see the picture).
I'm not afraid of cutting and welding, but i have no clue what i am suposed to do.
Can i do it someway, or should i buy a new controller with a more classic looking receiver ?
Thnaks :slight_smile:
