I have the vesc programmed and my custon remote connected and the vesc runs the motor when it is plugged into my computer (just plugged in not connected to vesc tool) but the second I unplug it the vesc no longer runs the motor and the yellow light doesnt flash indicating signal either. Probally a stupid error, but if anyone could help trouble that would be greatly appreciated.

Are you saying that the remote will run the vesc when it is connected to the computer or that your keyboard buttons will run the vesc?
