It's just two batteries in series wired to a BMS. With an antispark inline and a XLR charge input. It looks complicated but it's as simple as I can make it.

I mean make a wiring diagram like this

You need to know which is your first pack and your last pack and which of the balance wires is the first one

For me your diagram looks wrong as you cut the red (positive) balance lead from one pack.

One more question.
You want to wire it up as charge only bms?

Sorry I am still learning.

& I was going to go that route of having it charge only. Unless there is any easy way to setup discharge.

If you trust your work then I don't see any problems with your wiring. 

When you okug everything up, let it sit for a minute and see if anything starts getting hot. 

As per diagram, good job. Just remember, instead of overlapping your balance leads the way you did, use 90Â° turns. More easy to read ðŸ‘Š

Itâ€™s easy to set up, but if your bms is rated to only 10-20a it does not make a sense to wire it up for discharge as your bms will cut off power each time you come over that.

Okay, this thread is way too convoluted for me to understand.

Your balance wires are super wonky and probably will start a fire the way they currently are.

What is the most positive wire on each battery? Is it the red one?

Does it go:

Black - cell1 negative
Yellow -cell1 positive
White - cell2 positive
Blue - cell 3 positive
Black - cell 4 positive
Red - cell 5 positive

I'm simply asking if that matches up, I'm not saying that it does. BUT it is my suspicion that this is what the wires mean.

If it IS how it is wired, then your wires are wrong. I can upload a fixed diagram for some clarification if this is the case.

Could you make a corrected diagram? The board ran fine and I tested charging and it worked and i unplugged everything to move it to my enclosure and it stopped charging. The power supply is assuming the batteries are charged because of a green light. Also one of my batteries voltage is lower than the other.

That's because the balance wires are off. Disconnect your BMS and don't use it before you fix this.

Yellow -4 Volts

The colors don't tell me anything since I don't know exactly how you ended up wiring it.

Look back at your original diagram.

List the voltage between ground and each pin.

like:
Ground -> 1
Ground -> 2
Ground -> 3
Ground -> 4
Ground -> 5
Ground -> 6
Ground -> 7
Ground -> 8
Ground -> 9
Ground -> 10


That's about as foolproof as I can think of right now. It would REALLY help if you have actual pictures of how you've wired this thing together.

Ground -2- 7v
Ground -3- 10v
Ground -4- 13v

Ground -6- 21v
Ground -7- 24v
Ground -8- 28v
Ground - 9- 32v
Ground -10- 32v
 I changed the wiring it looks like I had a negative in for number 5. So, I probably fried the bms? I have another one on the way just in case. I will be posting a new diagram later today and pictures of current setup. The only issue I am having is the packs not charging, so I am assuming that the bms is fried.
