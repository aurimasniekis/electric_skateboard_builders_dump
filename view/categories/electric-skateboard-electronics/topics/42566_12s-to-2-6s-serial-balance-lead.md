if you can´t find any, solder your own - just get a 12s and two 6s cables.

I could technically do that but I don’t really want to as I am not the best at soldering. I would rather buy one.

If no one had anything that they can recommend, can someone post a diagram of how I would solder this contraption.

Do you have a 12s hobby charger?
Or connecting to a Bms ?
