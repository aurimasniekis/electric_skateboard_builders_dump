hi,
I wanted to buy on hobby king a sk3 turnigy 6374 190kv but the finished europae warehouse and I do not want to pay for shipment from hong kong. I have seen that there is a 6364 190 kv with similar characteristics, so it changes from the two?

```
64's and 55's tend to have similar stator sizes, 74's have longer stators thus more power

so it's best to wait and take the 6374
