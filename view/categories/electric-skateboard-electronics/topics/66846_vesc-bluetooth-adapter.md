Hello I was thinking of getting this. Does anyone know if I would be able to put a speed limit with my phone through this really quick or a watts limit, also can I connect to the vesc tool on my computer with this? Basically if I want to give my board to some one not that experienced I want to be able to quickly change the speed limit with my phone.

I just attached a HM-10 bluetooth module to my dual focbox setup and it works fine and will do all that you want. was about $5 from china. I'd imagine the one you linked will be perfectly fine as well

So can you change the speed limit with it? Can you send me a link where it's for 5 dollars?
