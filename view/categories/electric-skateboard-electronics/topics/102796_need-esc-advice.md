Just bought my 144 Samsung 40T cells along with a 12s bms, and was wondering what ESC to buy. I'm undecided between 2 and 4 wheel drive. Id prefer a 4wd, but haven't read much about how to make that work with a single battery. Is the focbox unity a good choice for the 2wd setup? Anyone have any advice on how to make a 4WD with a single battery?
