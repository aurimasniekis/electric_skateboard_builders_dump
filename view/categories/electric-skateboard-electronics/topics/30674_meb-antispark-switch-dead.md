Commuting back from work today my board cut out, luckily right before a downhill section. 

Thought it was a loose connection somewhere but it appears to be a dead switch. I bought a used MEB  antispark switch from here. 

Aside from running power through it and measuring output voltage, is there anything I can check to make sure? Could the actual button switch ever go out while the pcb is still good?

I have a backup switch so should be ok but just wondering.

That's strange, they usually break and get stuck in the on position.

Ya, usually they get stuck on. I'm sure I know the back up switch your referring to.:grin:
Usually it's one of the MOSFETs.
