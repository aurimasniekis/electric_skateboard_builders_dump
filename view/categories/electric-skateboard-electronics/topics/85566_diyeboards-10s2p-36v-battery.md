Hi,

I have managed to find a reasonable priced 10s2p from  http://www.diyeboard.com.

Please see link:
http://www.diyeboard.com/10s2p-36v-44ah-1584wh-samsung-18650-battery-kit-with-enclosure-p-613.html

I want to know if anyone has had any experience with this company/battery and would it work with my relatively basic board. I am looking to upgrade it in the future but I would like to know if it would even work with my current parts.   

**ESC:**
[UK X-car Beast Series ESC Brushless 1 8 Scale 120a ](https://www.ebay.co.uk/p/UK-X-car-Beast-Series-ESC-Brushless-1-8-Scale-120a/14012479120?iid=162835176520&amp;chn=ps)
**Motor:**
Turnigy Aerodrive Sk3

I have looked into LIPO but really cant be asked with all the complexity and maintenance of the battery type so I am definitely set on working with a lithium ION.

Any help would be greatly appreciated :))

A search here will show you that it's a shady company that is banned from visiting or advertising on this forum following a string of nonsense cumulating in the owner sharing personal information of a customer here maliciously, including full address, name and credit card information. 

Aside from that the battery is probably made from fake cells and is poorly welded/insulated from vibration. 

With all that said... it does work. I personally wouldn't have that bomb in my home though.

EDIT: get a vesc, that esc doesnt know how to brake an esk8 and will be rough to ride. A 4.12 flipsky single on ebay is cheap and works much better for our purpose.

Thanks for the information, think Iâ€™m going to avoid..

Do you know any place where I can get a lithium Ion battery with BMS that I can ship/get in the UK that will work with my current shambles of a board and future vesc??

Im in the UK as well, we're pretty limited at the moment for battery choice unfortunately. Some of our European battery builders can help?

@DavidBanner (Luke is in the uk)
@e.board_solutions
@Acido
@pjotr47

I'd dodge Kevin Dark if you come accross him on Facebook or whatever,  he's a bit busy and letting people down at the moment.

does ownboard, wowgo, or meepo ship to you? that would be your best super chap option for that size enclosure. Also i would get the samsung 6.0 or sanyo, much better than that 4.0 one

I have been running this battery pack in my build. It works alright but there have been many more reviews surfacing since then... That is pretty shocking (pardon the pun) if that is true @ [brenternet](/u/brenternet)

There's no conjecture here. The whole ban thing is just fact unfortunately. 

As for the batteries themselves, I'd say it's personal choice, QC can't very high at those prices.

Regardless who is selling or building your pack avoid 2p. Unless they are done with high discharge cells 2p will deliver very low continuous amps. By forcing the pack to be at burst most of the time you will kill It in a very short time. Aim for at least 3p or high amps 2p.

If anyone can get me a link to a battery that I can buy straight away, that would be amazing :)

The 2p battery kinda sucks but the 5p battery is okay for temporary use if you are on a budget. Whilst I don't recommend buying from diyeboard my best advice would be to only use paypal  :slight_smile:

A quick search on eBay and you will find most things he sells for less, if your looking for less expensive parts as the Chinese ESCs and motors go

I bought a DIYeboard 2 months ago. SMH . Im currently replacing everything.  It works alright . just the battery sag is horrible. It lasts for about 7 miles maybe . and it over heats.  Ugh ðŸ˜ž

Get NESE modues from https://18650.lt and samsung 2R or 30Q battery from https://ru.nkon.nl/(for usa) or https://eu.nkon.nl/(for europe). You'll get a solid battery for much cheaper.

I would personally buy another 10s5p from diye but would never waste a second on anything smaller from them.
