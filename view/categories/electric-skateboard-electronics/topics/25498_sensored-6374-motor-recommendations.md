Hi guys,

Any recommendations for sensored 6374 motors? Which of these would you prefer and why:

DIYelectricskateboard
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/motor-6374-190kv-3150w/



Maytech
http://www.maytech.cn/en/mto6374-170-ha/10339.html



Psychotiller
https://psychotiller.com/product/6374-sensored-powerplant



AlienPowerSystems
http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-6374-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-170kv-3200w/

AlienPowerSystems also have a 6384 motor with 130 KV which can be possibly also purchased with a higher KV rating.

Cheers!

Will you be using one motor? What battery are you using? What gearing ratio are you using? Do you want speed or torque?

```
I will be using two motors combined with Evolve AT wheels. Motor pulley will have15 teeth and wheel pulley 66 teeth which results in a gear ratio of 1:4.4. Would like to have some decent speed (35-45 km/h) with these 7" wheels but also PLENTY of torque.

I would recommend the torqueboards 6374 190 kv motors. But what battery will you be using

Yeah, 190kv woud be your best choice @ 10s. If you were running 8s I would have promoted the hell out of my motor though. LOL

## \#13 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2017-12-02T14:33:19.380Z Reads: 563

```
my choices would be

-torque boards 190kv
-alien 6374 or 6384. Almost purchased them as total they're $20 more shipped then the torque boards...but ya know tb had a $99 sale on the 6374 for black Friday so couldn't pass it up

I can't speak to longevity of APS motors.

But friends and I have beaten the hell out of torque board motors, almost to the point you'd expect cracked magnets in the bell, but they just keep rocking. Tb motors are solid for sure.

I've had bad experiences with torque boards motors that's why I no longer will buy them have had 4 and 3 out of 4 have failed me 1 6374 and 2 6355 there good but longevity wise there bad

So I decided to open 3 motors recently and 6374 was broken magnet(have to buy a new one they don't sell magnets alone) 6355 both had bearing and loose magnet along with strator moving

I'll report back in a few months!

You could have ordered a higher KV as well. They do custom which doesn't cost more.

I got really good feedbacks on them, and since I have a dual 6374 on Trampa I can confirm they won't heat too much because of sealed can. They perform so well!

I think you can find lots of satisfied riders here, @okp too !

Hi guys i have two TB 6374 190kv motors with 12s2p battery but i have so bad range on it like 7miles or so, and i have set in vesc only 40A max per one motor, i using 90mm wheels and 16T/36T pulleys. I wanna change motors to smaller or idk , just to have more range, witch ones are good for range ? Just wanna use 12s battery cause cost to much to changing that to.

You're not gonna get any noticable range increase without upgrading battery

[/quote]

Actually, a change in riding style can drastically increase range -- but @scepterr is right, nothing mechanical or electrical will get you much, aside from increasing the battery to 10S3P (30Q) or anything using more cells.

Ok guys , Thx, so now is question about battery 12s4p or 10s5p is almost same number of cells , i dont need 12s voltage for speed so it enough 10s voltage for me but what about range? cause i read if you have more Voltage you dont need that much Amps putting to Motors ? I realy like to hear it is about the same cause i buy fast charger for 12s battery for 80usd :smiley: but probably i gonna need change to 10s

Ofc not all the time but yea now i have set vesc to max erpm to 30mph but the board can go much faster
on 10s i should go 32 max so it is enough for me , so now it going about range 10s5p vs 12s4p

For all those that have purchased their motors from APS, where are you getting your 10mm ID pullies from?

I'm having a hardtime getting a 13T steel pulley with no overhang

Finding the right pulley is a bit of a pity. I get my 16T and 18T aluminium pulleys either from TorqueTransmission (https://www.torquetrans.com/htd-pulley-5mm) or ebay. I've got access to a lathe and can modify the pulleys to my needs. Doesn't APS offer steel pulleys?

I am running mine (APS 6384s) for a couple of weeks in BLDC mode with no issues. I never installed the sensors since my setup hardly stutters. The motors work great and all magnets are still in place. I like the sound they make when hitting a certain rpm, it almost sounds like a turbo whistle. They get pretty hot at 80A/motor but other than that I have not yet experienced any issues. Also, I am really careful not to hit the motor bells on anything hard.
