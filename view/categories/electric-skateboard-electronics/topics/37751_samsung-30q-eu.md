It seems like the price has jumped up quite a bit on nkon.nl, any other Europe based reliable source for say 120 cells?

Dammit I like nkon but I think it's more than raw lithium price increases, there seems to be a lack of competition, must check banggoods price again

Simple... many of us are buying them cells. That's the reason they are upping their prices all over the place. Market works like that...and we are the culprits. We are in great need of them. Butterfly effect boys. Offer & Demand. Is been like this for the last 4 thousand years. :money_mouth:
