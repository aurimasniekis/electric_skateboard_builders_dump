I have two motors and one is fine but one only runs on the bldc tool.  I had an in and out problem before and hot glued my receiver plug aand it seemed to solve it even though it made no sense to me. Now the one motor won't respond at all to the transmitter, just the bldc tool where it seems fine <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/edbdc3d907b8839b7a4aa10809a58b2cc580492b.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I'm now mixing batteries since velcroing tomthe bottom of a dropped dropthru is destroying them.
