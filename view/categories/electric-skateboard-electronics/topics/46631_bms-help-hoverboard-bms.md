Has anyone had any experience with batteries from a hoverboard? Specifically with the BMS? Mine looks like this and I am wondering what the heck to do when it comes time to charge... I have a lead coming from P+ and C-, are there other spots to add a charging port or are those it. I know C- usually goes to the charge port.![IMG_1263|666x500](upload://AncUxH8ZVOLYwfSqfoPcbGTrHan.JPG)![IMG_1282|375x500](upload://6JEV9NfiR6oLDgbSme77COCbMqd.JPG)![IMG_1284|375x500](upload://c4QdHTyRxrHv4mprQBcjhQS4MlE.JPG)

Garbage batteries and garbage BMS's. Toss it before it explodes.

Have you heard of [the incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_scooter#Issues_and_incidents) where they catch fire?  That's due to the garbage cells and BMSs

I don't know much about those packs but this dude seems to be chill with making a power wall out of them: :face_with_monocle:

His batteries are not used as ours
he has probably 50p packs and we have 2p average(justy a wild guess) we draw 10+a per cell and he draws 0,1A per cell.

He worked his shit out if his house didn't burn down already
He also has a much bigger avalible space

Thats why he can use those batteries that are no use for eskates

The hoverboards that catch fire either have a faulty bms or the manufacturer has done something dumb. I remember seeing a tear down of a cheapo hoverboard, that had the bms in the battery, but the charging leads were soldered right onto the battery pack, not the bms C/P- pin :smiley:  The cells are mostly good, thats why Jehu uses them in his powerwall.

Reuse (or sell) the unreliable bms and keep the cells - thats what i would do.

I ended up running new wires to power the ESC directly on top, and I am using a hub motor ESC so I think its limited to 10A or so anyways. If it doesn't seem right or hold up, I will probably do what you said and dismantle it.:sweat_smile:

Those systems are prone to catastrophic failure. If/when it fails it won't leave anything behind to dismantle.
