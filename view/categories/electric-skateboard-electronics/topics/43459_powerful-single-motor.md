So I have this single drive build in mind and need some help picking the right motor, at the moment i have 3 options: 
Turnigy SK3 
Alien 6384 
Ollin OM-6085 200KV 

Turnigy has a good price to performance ratio, but i know that it is very loud?
Alien is the one i like the most, but the quality is sub par so i have heard?
The olin is my second choice, this one is quiet and powerfull, but the price with import and shiping taxes is a bit too much for me, not sure if that motor is worth 200+$ ?

I weight around 150lbs, have a few hills in my home country, I want this board to have zero compromises, I pull the triger and I get anywhere. Will use a vesc and a 10s or 12s battery, most likely 12s3p, which should I go for? Or maybe there is some other good options in the market? Anything located in USA is not a good option for me. Thanks for the help guys!

It depends on your budget,  if you can afford to buy sensored 6374 or 84 motor from APS, go for it :) I have good expereiences with all of their products :) If you want to save a bit, go for SK3, they are both quite good motors...the sound is not something I would care about, you can always use FOC if you have a good VESC :) 

If you are not from US I wouldnt even consider Ollin's motor, too expensive to get it to Europe...

If Alien motor quality is fine, this would be my first choice.

You can also go for this one: https://www.banggood.com/Racerstar-6368-BRD6368-280KV-6-12S-Brushless-Motor-For-Balancing-Scooter-p-1117657.html?rmmds=search&amp;cur_warehouse=CN&cur_warehouse=CN

is a little bit cheaper I think

I would go for the sk3 6474 if you're on a budget, its the most 6374 I've used and its cheaper than all the other 6374s. But if you perfer sensored motors you should look at something else, I've never used sensors and it works fine

Check my site chiboards.com 

I have the 190kv 6374 (sk3) for $120 shipped in the us. Extended shaft, key way hall sensors. 
Perfect for FOC, ultra quiet 
Strong enough to push me 230lbs on shag carpet from stand still with 1 motor

Each motor you listed has its disadvantages.
The SK will require some modification to the shaft.
The Alien has a 10mm shaft.
The Ollin is sweet, but out of stock, don't think it's coming back. 

I recommend the racerstar 5065 or the Turnigy skateboard motor.

https://eskating.eu/product/eskating-pro-motors-6374-190kv-waterproof-sealed-and-sensored/

Can highly recomend this one, its a Maytech rebranded one so easy to find from somewhere else as well.

3500W, lots of power i use it for a single drive board at the moment.

Your vesc cant handle 3500W wattage in motors is not really a big deal you maybe hit 70% when you hit full throttle and you weigh 120kg

You would need to output 290A on 12s for 3500W

Actually the hobbyking motor sensor wires and bullets are both plug and play with the vesc..When HK began making a skateboard specific motor, that's exactly what they did..., it has the right plugs, sensors, plenty of power (2000w) to be used as a single with the correct kv for a single as well at 125, extended shaft and key..not to mention a sub $10 mount that works really well..and it's cheaper, like 50 bucks less, that's a lot..oh and sealed too..

You are talking about the SK3 series motors? If so, you are wrong. 

The Hobbyking SK3 motors are not sealed, they do not have extened shafts, they do not have a keyway, they do not have sensors therefore do not have the correct sensor ports, they do not have 5.5mm bullets, They dont have silicone wire. 

You're not even talking about the same motor bud

Did you click on the link I posted? I have never once spoke about the HK sk3 motor, but the HK skateboard motor... it is sealed, it has sensors, it's 125kv at 2000w, it's made specifically for skateboards to be a single motor, it is better in every way and cheaper, I am sorry to say this, and I do not make any money in this game..so I am not here to profit, I'm just saying, this is the best value for a single motor, make a comparison chart, pro and cons lists, do the math, whatever.. Don't put words in my mouth like I'm talking about something else when I clearly linked it above, go do your research instead of jumping on a chance to tell someone their wrong..here's the link again and even a picture, it's not a sk3, it's a turnigy electric skateboard motor..![Turnigy|565x414](upload://oBhO1hVQdY3kNn68dR9Q6QaicyH.jpg)

36/15 gearing on 15mm belt

10s or 37v's for my tests

90mm was like 18mph, 
96mm was 20mph
107mm 22mph but not enough torque, need 48v+ or 40 tooth wheel pulley (haven't tested yet, but will soon)

I would be concerned if the kv was any higher for this application...I weigh over 200lb's..at 2000w the 125kv is perfect...if it was a 3000w motor a higher kv would be fine...like the 3000w sk3 at 149kv worked well for testing but I don't like sk3 motors..and even stripped a motor mount screw on the 1st one I tried..it quickly came off, despite it's additional power and speed....

[/quote]

Should have known this as HK sells hobby grade motors for RC...which most are sold by stator size vs external dimensions like most skate motors.

I never understood why people would use two different naming/sizing conventions. It's always been stator size...until I came to esk8 which is always external dims.

Oh and then you look at like RCtimer and they use a different way to measure them, so it's all over the place, there's differences between the airplane motors and has been for a long time..it's like they wish to confuse us all on purpose..I like sticking to stator size because it actually tells me something about it's performance..can size isn't important really unless your talking about how much you can squeeze into it..

6374.. but really external of 6386. And a 50xxstator..

But really I think it's in runner vs out runner.. (the sizing) who knows...these companies are magical. 

The real truth is I want brother hobby to make a motor with n52sh arc magnets with 0.2 clearance and 0.15 laminations, with 20guage windings üòÇ

And also, I have a funny question, I had the impression, that evolve board, gives a suprising amount of torque for lighter people, like my self, So I just basically want that, I am used to very powerful   e-bikes, and also snowboard a lot, so i think I can handle it coming from koowhell, that thing goes fast in a straight line. Ok, so i want a single drive driver, to have a Vesc, but 2 is just too expencive for me, so I am asking you this: I'm a light rider, 150lbs ish, in reality which single  motor can give that?
Thank you
P.s. with small street wheels :slight_smile:

If you want to go with the Evolve motors, here's a link to the 200kv version of the same motor. You'll have to modify the connectors to make it work with a VESC though. The motor phase wires go to a single connector and the sensor wires have to be moved to a JST connector. I have them on my first build and I think they work fine.

Yeah you would need dual before those would be good, but legit any 190kv 6374 motor would do you just fine.

190KV = Great torq, and most 6374 has around the same amount of power that dual can give you (Not the exact same but around there)
