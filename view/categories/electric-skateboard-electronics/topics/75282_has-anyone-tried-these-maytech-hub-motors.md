Im thinking of buying [this kit](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Maytech-free-shipping-2pcs-single-skateboard-surf-trucks-1pcs-and-90mm-60kv-electric-skateboard-motor-hub/1630416_32819933840.html?spm=2114.12010612.8148356.50.7bf643052069zO) to replace my belt driven setup. Has anyone had any experience with these motors? I will be using it as a single motor setup with my VESC (4.2) with a 6s battery pack.

What's wrong with your belt?

They do the job, best to avoid starting from a stand still, and it's fine on essentially flat ground. Any bit of sustained slope would make it struggle, unless you're kid-sized, hence why they work a bit better as a pair.
Pretty stiff riding feeling, and they tend to get pretty hot after a while, but so far (touching wood) not to the point of self destruction. 
Superbly silent on FOC mode, that's a nice thing.
And you can replace the $10 PU sleeve once worn out.

Snapped... ive also worn down my motor pulley quite a bit. I know wear is normal and these parts need to be replaced but getting replacement parts that don't cost a ton to get shipped to me (QLD, Australia) is extremely difficult. I would rather a hub motor that doesnt require costly parts to be maintained.

Thanks, I'll consider getting it and if I do I'll be sure to post back with my experiences.

I had them on a 10S battery. With VESC´s they are rideable, but 6S and 60kv, assuming it´s a Li/Ion battery will give you a whopping 26km/h topspeed.
Currently I am using the generic hubs which you can find on almost every cheap chinese prebuild and I like them better.
The Maytech hubs also have a 100kv variant, which might be a better match for you.
Anyway with Torqueboards direct drive launching on Blackfriday and maybe Enertions sale on the Raptor hubs,i would hold my breath for alittle longer.
I hink you might be underwhelmed by the performance of the hubs comnig from your Beltdrive.

What are you talking about?  I live in queensland and have parts shipped regularly.  Shipping is not extortionate but sometimes can be time consuming.  Use the right sites and they all deliver.  
That motor as a single will be rubbish on 6s.  No torque at all.  If you want something cheap to get the belt drive up and running then go for a hobby king pulley and get the belts from rs.  Both deliver in less than a week from the aus warehouse.

You’re saying there is a chance the raptor hubs will be sold seperately?

Damn sounds great, was leaning towards building a first build belt driven but now I’m in doubt again. We’ll have to see.

Forgot to say that my experience was with a 36V battery, and that worked. Like others have pointed, on 6S, it's likely to be very underwhelming!
