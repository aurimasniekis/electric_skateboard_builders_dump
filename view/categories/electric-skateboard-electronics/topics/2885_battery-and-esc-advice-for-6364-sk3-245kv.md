I have a ks3 6364 mm 245kv motor what ESC and battery should i get? I was thinking that the enertion space cell pro enclosure  was the right one and an 70 A ESC would be good to... Having a ks3 6364 mm 245 kv motor what should i get?

ok first read through some other posts because this has already been explained quite a bit. In answer to ur question however get a 120a esc (the fvt or x car series is nice) or a 150amp esc. I would also reccomend it to be a car esc if u want brakes.

I might suggest simplifying your title...  hehehe.

back on topic - what's your budget?  What batteries or what # series are you planning to run (6s/8s/10s/12s)?  Realize that higher series (more voltage) is great until you need a specialty charger and higher cost ESC, and re-gearing, and...  Just more complicated in general.  I've been perfectly happy with some 6/8s setups and plan on 10/12s with next build since i've slowly acquired chargers and gears to make it work.

I still think the VESC is the best ESC so far for e-skateboards.  You need to do some reading and make sure you can follow directions and steps to configure - it's not plug and play.  But not that daunting after a bit of reading and self education.

Space cell - it's  a great "plug and play" setup - but a bit pricey compared to some of the lipos available.  Likely not as simple, but if on a budget i would stick with a few lipos instead.

GL!

i agree with you on everything except the esc and lipos. The vesc is not a simple esc to configure and if he was having trouble deciding on weather to get a 70a esc then he should probably stick to a programmable car esc. I wouldn't recommend lipos anymore to noob unless they have worked with them previously. The dangers out weigh the cost. I would say tell them to save up and get a pre maid power pack. This way we dont have the same issues we did with the hoverboards and dont get this whole business shut down.

[ Soapbox rant ]

OMG - not the hoverboard BS again...

There is a huge difference between lipos you charge independently (or via a para board), and a cheap ass chinese BMS that overcharges/damages/blows-up cheap lipos buried in a hoverboard.

Common sense here is you don't charge damaged cells - swollen/puffed or compromised.  You place them in a safe area to charge in a pyrex dish, or charge bag, and keep an eye on them while charging.  If hot - stop.

And if you can't follow step by step instructions (literally copy/paste) to configure VESC - you should be an e-go and be done with it.

Agree on the FVT 150A ESC.  Good for <6s and price is right if you hunt a bit.  DIYes/Torqueboards has some nice ESC's as well to consider for about the same $.

DO NOT GET ANYTHING EXCEPT A CAR ESC.  Plane/Heli/Boat - DON'T BUY!  Saving some money on an ESC is great until you can't stop your board going 20mph...  My skin and unbroken bones are worth a bit of extra $.

The space cell is what voltage? I was thinking on buying a 70 A ESC and i want a 10 s battery, are these the correct ones to get?

That motor is going to fly on 10S. I had to check and make sure it was even rated for that, but it is. Wow. 

you're going to want either a VESC or a torqueboards 12S ESC for that monster. Let me know if you hit 88 miles per hour and end up in a field where the old mall will be.

@joaoalmeida [I use this motor and 8s](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-village-build-s9-faultine-paris-195mm-sk3-6764-diyes-mount-8s-vesc-127mm-pneumatic-wheels/292). It's a great combination, recommended. I use VESC and I'm extremely happy with it.

I'm surprised that you're looking for a "cheap" ESC but you're considering going with 10S which is going to be expensive and likely more than you need. If cheap is what you need try a single 6S Lipo and one of the community-approved car ESCs... but the ESC won't save you much since VESC is ~100usd.

You missed a sale where you could buy 2 4S batteries for $40 with $7 shipping, but now I would say buy 3 3S lipos  Any hobbyking turnigy or zippy

@joaoalmeida I use two Zippy compact 4S 25C 5000mah packs wired in series (that means that discharge of both packs is combined to increase power output). It's written about in my build thread that I linked above.

You gotta do some research on your own, my friend. You can let people tell you what to get or you can get reading everything you can and make a better decision. Plus you will be stronger for it. Some dudes on the forum make it all look so easy, but it is a hell of a lot of work to research all of the parts!! I still get frustrated when studying. It's not for a lack of options, it's too damn many options!! Don't get discouraged by all of the stuff there is to learn. Take it all in bites. Also consider that the cheapest "buy in" price is not always the best overall decision. Especially if you are on a budget, you can't afford to keep replacing bad parts. Then there's bad parts that take out other good parts as they inevitably fuck up.
You have a motor..245kv...You can begin to build your electrical system off of those specs. If you go Lipo, it will be a cheaper buy in, but questionable durability/ longevity and you will need to buy a balance charger and power supply to go with it. If you choose 18650 packs, you can get one(or build one) with a battery management system (BMS) that will take good care of your investment. If you are looking for wicked cheap..Lipo/ImaxB6/power supply. Check out hobbyking.com and use the toolbar to narrow your battery search down to 4s and use two wired in series. IMO Try to get the highest "C" rating for the $$$. 
 I wish you the best, brutha.

use lipos first because making your own pack takes lots of understanding things about batteries and is very dangerous to begin with. if u want 18650s just buy a pre maid pack.

[quote="joaoalmeida, post:5, topic:2894"]
how do i build 18650 packs with a BMS?
[/quote]

That's a whole other topic with a lot of moving parts and knowledge requirments. A few of us have just started building our own in our garages after a couple years of riding on lipos. Maybe at some point someone would like to start a thread about it and offer some advice. There are a few threads here already that contain good information, and i have posted a little bit about it as part of my build threads. 

but building your own 18650 packs is not cheap. There is a learning curve, and there is equipment. 18650 cells are not cheap when buying enough cells to make the pack worth it. And not only do you need a BMS, you need a charger to match the BMS. You *may* be able to build an 18650 pack right the first time and not set it on fire, but i think just starting out you would be better dealing with a premade, off the shelf lipo pack and a regular old balance charger. Try to find one with an AC cord though so you don't have to find a DC power supply. You may some cash there.
