I'm going to get the focbox Vesc. Is there a way to hook up a bluetooth module to it and get stats such as speed, distance, power, etc? I see people who have done it, I just don't know if it compatible with the focbox. I have absolutely no idea how any of the wireless stuff works, so thanks in advance!

Yes it's compatable. The focbox that is.

is it just a rule of thumb that all vescs are compatible? How do you know what works and what doesn't?

Get HM-10 instead of HC-05 and get the one without the little button in the corner

What :arrow_double_up: said lol.
I do believe most vesc are BT capable. As long as the have the outputs for one.

Or just take the guesswork and mistakes out of it and get [one that's known to be good](https://psychotiller.com/product/mccloeds-blue-tooth-modules)
