I donÂ´t think that the built in ESC can handle 12S. Only the VESC and some really expensive Hobby ESCs can.

Did anyone else notice the weird controller?

It seems like DIY but hard to tell. I had this guess because the side does not look very smooth. more like stacked lines from a 3d printer

This board has a 6s max ESC. Basically the 120a 6s FVT. I bought one of their thumb controllers, you know, for science. It is 3d printed.
