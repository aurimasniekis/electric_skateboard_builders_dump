Just recently bought this LED on a whim. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/f/ff15480531ae994d8d52f9d3483d5c3da5c2282b.jpg" width="666" height="500">
It is powered when I plug it in the remote receiver but I'm not able to control the led modes with the knob on the mini controller. Do you guys think I need a separate controller like this one? https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-receiver-controlled-switch-1.html
Has anyone tried modding a mini controller?

Link to the LEDs? Are they individually addressable?

I think the range on whatever controller you have isn't the correct range for the LED's since its all preprogrammed
