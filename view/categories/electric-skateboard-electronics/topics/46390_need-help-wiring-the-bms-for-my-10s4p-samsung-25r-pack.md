I have been searching for a while but can't find the exact answer im looking for, im making a custom 18650 pack in 10s4p using Samsung 25R cells, I have an 80A super BMS and am a bit confused on the wiring. I have seen this diagram, 

![bms 2|517x500](upload://xeGZVPmko6lLnKnTa2Q8LKJiYuz.jpg) 

but I have also seen this 


![bms 1|690x490](upload://x9WMcPEd46tMjjMEDeK8KCTS1ev.png) my question is when I am wiring the p- and the positive wire, does it need to go to the motor as well as the VESC or is the VESC enough because that goes to the motor itself. I believe the first diagram is correct for me because thats the one for my BMS and I only have the b- and p- not ch-. Just wondering if I have to wire to motor. Thanks

This section of balance wires are numbered incorrectly.
