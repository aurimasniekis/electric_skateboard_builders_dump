Alright, I received all the parts I needed for my first build. Now what pissed me off a bit at first was not to receive a bind key with my receiver (Nano-X), but I figured I could just connect two of the pins together to get the same result. I tried to find on the internet how to bind the nano-x transmitter to the receiver, and in every video there is a red blinking light on the receiver, which I don't have. There is no red blinking light and the transmitter won't bind.

Do you have any picture of your connection, so we can help you double check them... alao the nano-x have a auto-bind fonction wich do not require a binding tool.

Have you try to just plug one vesc at the time... just to see if the problem is from the connection or the receiver

Light doesn't turn on on the reveiver, tried with both or only one VESC at a time. No change, no red light.

Your cable are inverted inside your connector... it should be brown, red, yellow (same order as on the vesc) 

Edit: can you double check (still not 100% sure, since I'm on mobile ðŸ™‚)

Doesn't light up on both sides anyways. Tried brown, red, yellow and yellow, red, brown. No red light on both sides... :/

Do you have an Arduino? You can make a simple script to power the receiver, and also listen for the 1-2 millisecond pulses. Or, use any 5v power source, and a small hobby servo to test it.

You can use a servo, also. I was just going to recommend a micro controller because some people don't have servos.

No.... the cable inside the connector.... they had swap some cable when soldering them on the vesc... brow (gnd), should be on the outside side of the receiver, red(5v) should be in the middle and yellow (signal) sould be on the interior side of the receiver, same order on the vesc...

But if you look at your the red and brown are not in the same order on your vesc and on the connector.

I wonder if the Nano-X has a light regardless of connection?
Maybe you need to rebind the controller and receiver.

Edit: JohnnyMeduse may be right. Just make sure the ORDER matches on both ends, and then turn the cable around to get it to work.

Then it should work- if not, flip the connector on the receiver side.
It's good form to make sure that it's right-way-round, but if you need to you can use it backwards if you've already soldered one end.

Ok. Try rebinding. unplug the power to the VESC, then insert a bind plug. Power it up, then turn on the remote with the button held down. See what happens?

Ok... just make sure that your connection are the same as those (I had make a nice drawing that I don't want to loose ðŸ˜…), and if you have acces to a multimer make sure that you have 5v on the 5v pin... and if not try to contact enertion support ðŸ˜‰

;)

I would test the power lines, too. But be CAREFUL. I don't think the VESC has short protection, so don't let the multimeter probes slip and short out the pinsâ€¦

If there are no lights on the receiver, then it is most likely faulty. Will they void warranty if you open the case and have a look at the soldering job? That'd be my first move, anyways.

I am no expert in electronics tbh. Whatever, if it voids warranty I'll just buy from another company -_-

Looks alright, to be honest. How are the voltages from the VESC? You may have a cold joint at the servo lead on the VESC.

Hmm.. That would be a priority in my case. I have 2, but some people have entire collections.

Does it seem like the receiver is connecting to the remote during binding at all? There might be an RF problem.

Unplug the connector from the receiver,  put your multimeter on the 20V DC scale

with the vesc powered on, red probe on the middle pin of the connector and black probe on the ground. (red on red, black on brown cable)

You should be getting 4.8-5v, but since the receiver's lights already work that's probably the case.

Yeah, so your receiver / vesc probably isn't the problem after all- Either the remote has a problem, or it's magic. Can you open the remote and take some good pictures? :D

As I wrote earlier, receiver normally has a red light flashing on it when it's trying to bind, this light is not lighting up on my receiver. However, my transmitter do have a green blinking light, which is normal. Next week I'll go to Enertion's repair facility and they told me they could help me out with my board and repair the receiver. I'm just glad it's not the VESCs lol

I know the feeling. I'd be fine if my batteries were bent in half- just protect my VESC!! I got mine for around $120 before Ollin had to raise prices, so now I basically have a board designed around a $150 piece of electronics. I get real scared sometimes that i've broken it, but it's working O.K so far :) Good luck with the repair center, and maybe they'll let you keep the old one for parts.

someone else on here posted they were also having receiver binding problems, so they opened up the receiver and the sticky foam tape holding the board down was conductive enough that it was causing a problem, so they switched it to the side that didn't have any connections and it worked fine.  maybe check that out.

Interesting. Never thought of foam tape being too conductive, but if someone didn't do their research, I guess it's possible to end up using conductive material by accident.

Maybe the red led doesn't work and you also have the same issue I have....try removing the signal wire only and leave the power lines. Then see if your remote stops blinking and is solid green. If you plug the signal line back in after and it works then you have the same issue I have. Mine only binds with the signal line disconnected and then reconnected. I am sending mine in for repair.
