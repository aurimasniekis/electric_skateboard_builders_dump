So, I've had my Samsung 18650 batteries for a while now, just waiting for the rest of my board parts to come, but thought why not build it now, so it's ready when I get everything else. Problem is I don't know how to build a pack. I've searched the forums, but don't really see any in depth guides (I could be looking in the wrong place, or be completely blind). I was talking to @barajabali about the configuration, and the materials and tools I need. He recommended a 10s4p, which is what I will be doing. I'm gonna pick up a soldering iron, 240V 60W. Will that be alright? I read somewhere I need a higher W or something like that. For my build, I have a Tacon Bigfoot 160 motor (245kv). I'll need some wires and nickel strips (10mm recommended). Am I missing out on anything? Please do inform me if I am, I really have no idea how to. 

Thanks in advance.

There are quite a few videos on youtube. Have a look at Damien Rene, and look at ebike school on the internet. You should get an 80-100w iron.

A higher wattage iron will heat the cells up less and do the job quicker. Less damage to the cells.

A weller iron would probably work best but that one would be alright. Why aren't you spot welding your batteries?

Don't have access to one, unfortunately.

That solder should do though yes?

This is why I recommend at least a 240w and even better a 300w soldering gun.
I don't even like to solder 10-12 gauge wire with less.
The higher the wattage the quicker you can make the bond and the less area is heated.

my experience with those cheap soldering pencils that plug straight into the wall is that they overheat and burn up their tip  every time and become useless.
A Weller solder gun will cost a bit more but it will be worth it. And they don't burn up the tip.

@Airmacx what configuration are you doing again? Can't keep track these days. I will make you a diagram.

Hm, well for my build I'm a bit confused. I was going to use Tacons motor which was 245kv,but was recommended not do 10s4p. But since I've been introduced to all the problems I could face with a higher kv motor, I'm going with enertions r-spec 3200W. Same thing 10s4p.

The R-Spec 3200w sounds like a good choice for a single motor setup!
With 10s it should provide plenty of power.

Yup :) Unfortunately, I have to either wait and save more, or sell my Tacon, since I don't really have the option return it. Can't seem to post on the markets sub on here either. Let me know if you see anyone needng a motor!

I thought you had 20 so I was worried. Haha. @whitepony has made a few diagrams for this configuration. Here are some pictures of his designs: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/56baae186f4839fc239c6260de661846fdf3af3d.jpeg" width="591" height="154">

The difference between them is that the first one has both positive and negative wires ending at the same side.

:joy:

i decided against the first layout even though it has shorter and convenient placed battery wires. was afraid of wear & tear between the cells that, for picture 1, results in a short, and in picture 2 doesnt matter at all! afterall, electronic components in a skateboard suffer from a lot of hits and vibrations.
