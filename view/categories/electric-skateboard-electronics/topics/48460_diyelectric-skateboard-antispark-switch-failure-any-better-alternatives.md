I accidentally set both of the motors in my dual motor setup to run at 70 amps (each, I know pretty dumb right?) and I think it fried my antispark switch's mosfets because its stuck on and sparks when i tried to plug the battery back in. Are there any alternatives? could someone make me a custom one? i figured out my motors only need 51 amps max each and the battery is a 10s Li-Ion w/ BMS. Max discharge rate translates to around 40 amps if that helps.

No dude those things are just prone to fail a lot , has nothing to do with your settings , I run 37 bat and 80con amps on my settings without a problem  its 2 dual motors aswell . alternative wise u can get a anti spark switch most common and most reliable with xt90 anti apart switch

do you have a kind of antispark switch that you use specifically?

I don't use any switch if its not from the BMS or I'd use a loop key search loop key  hopefully that helps

Hi, I bought an anti spark switch on ebay, I had the non - latching button and put another button on the NC wire and it worked perfectly fine. So I set up the board and went for a ride and 800 meters in power started to cit out, then it came back and I continued to ride, but on my way home (2nd km) power completely cut off and something started to smell. When I rushed home and opened the  enclosure I saw that the mosfets had melted a hole in shrink wrap...
I don't know what should I do now. If I had done something wrong or if I should cool it somehow...![15566504592414279644416883785934|374x500](upload://x6wPjx44n3iAxT1ByffDgT305nu.jpeg) ![15566504847895978260481251717062|375x500](upload://pMbvUX0r742SH0qRQDrnY42ELCJ.jpeg) 
I had the wires soldered correctly but it just melted...

The button i got (model 6)

Come on. Please stop posting it everywhere...\
Measure the output voltage but I'm assuming that one of your MOSFETs is dead.
