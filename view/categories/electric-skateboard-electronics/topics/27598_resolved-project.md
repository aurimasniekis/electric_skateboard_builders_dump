The motor has too high diameter of 80mm...its too big...
IDK what is you desired top speed, but on 10s you would get [60kmph](http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":1,"batt-cells":10,"motor-kv":120,"system-efficiency":85,"motor-pulley-teeth":1,"wheel-pulley-teeth":1,"wheel-size":83}|) or maybe even more...you should go with lower kv motor...
what kind of direct drive? Carvon style? Hub motor?
730g is not that much...
It is really expensive, check [APS motors](http://alienpowersystem.com/product-category/brushless-motors/63mm/), there are some quite similar and cheaper...

Well good luck with that :D you will need it :D 

And I do not recommend you to use that high speed, it is really dangerous!

I think it s possible, but I am not sure...i think you would have to change ERPM limit to a lower value...

@pehra564:
@willpark16 was trying to do something similar, so I will supply you with the same threads that I sent him. You will likely end up using an SK3 motor, and for tool's youll likely need access to a lathe, CNC machine, and 3d printer.
