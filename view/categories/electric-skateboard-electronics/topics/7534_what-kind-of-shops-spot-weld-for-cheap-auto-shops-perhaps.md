There's a company near me that does furniture repair that welds. I just looked up welding on google maps.

@link5505 has a shop page for his batteries.   http://nosam.bigcartel.com/product/lithium-ion-batteries

I'm in Houston and have access to a spot welder, but I'm not experienced enough with it yet.
