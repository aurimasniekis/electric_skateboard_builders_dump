it is not already a good price 37$ ?
It is the lowest price i could find for this "torque board style" remote control online. 
Can you suggest where i can find it at lower price if it's not a good price?

That remote is unreliable. There are several threads about it.
There are people on the forums working on arduino remotes (@Sander @Print3r @lox897) that are about the same size.

For now you should go with a Mini remote or a GT2B instead. Just my two cents.

Or Benchwheel remote which looks the same but a bit bigger than the Nano remote.

The problem it's that it is too big to put it in the pocket. Just personal preference.
I would like to investigate more these problems with the winning remote people had, beacause at not even 2 meter away you can't have transmission problems. I would like to see the bords and where the receiver i positioned, because metal and carbon fiber block signal for the radio.

I eneded up buiyng it, and will make appropriate test before using it :

I used the winning remote. I added a ferrit ring to the cable between receiver and vesc. I added coaxial antennas on the remote and receiver. I mounted the receiver on the top of the board but still had always interferences at a road near to a railway crossing. Now I use the benchwheel remote without any problems.

Benchwheel would be the top! But i am on a very strict budjet and this was the cheapest remote  i could find that fits in the pocket :sweat_smile:
( I had found the benchweel for 40$ on aliexpress, but it was only the transmitter without receiver sadly )
If i will have problems with the winner , and i have a functional electric skateboard build i will upgrade later when i can afford :slight_smile:

Every now and then, Benchweel has a flash sales on AliExpress. I got the remote/receiver combo for about $45 last time.

I also read somewhere that there is a new nano remote circulating about. Maybe improved over the old one, has anyone heard anything about it?
