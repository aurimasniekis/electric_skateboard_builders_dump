I got my Bestech 12s 80A BMS through @AcidoÂ´s groupbuy. 

I ordered [my charger](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/12S-48V-50-4V-CV-4amp-Li-ion-LiPoly-Battery-Charger-Aluminum-Casing-Electric-Bicycle-Charger/32220991084.html?shortkey=iiaeEfy6&addresstype=600) from Aliexpress, shipping was quite fast. Check it out, it works great. It stays cool during charging since it has an aluminium case and the charge time is really good (4 Amp).

For a 150A 12S setup you need any amperage BMS and use something like @Kug3lis new antispark to control discharge 

So like a 12S 10A BMS and a 300A antispark switch which is wired in "bypass" or not discharging through the BMS but directly from the battery
