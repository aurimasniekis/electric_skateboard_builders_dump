on that page you link It says Motor has 32mm bolt hole spacing.

this is a diagram of the enertion mounting plate, it's compatible between 30-44mm.

Thanks for the replay.

Does it mean that the engine is compatible?

I'm not sure that the Diameter is compatible it says 59mm. Is it?

I already have the mount kit here and I had to give back the engine that I got because the shaft and the bolt holes were not ok.

Thanks for your help.
