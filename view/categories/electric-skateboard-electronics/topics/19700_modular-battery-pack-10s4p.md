Guys I thought I'd share my battery pack that was made by one of the ENDLESSPHERE members who specialize in building ebikes. 

Total setup is 10s4p built with LG HG2 Cells. Everything is split into 5 packs.
There are 4 packs with 8 battery cells and 1 pack with 8cells + BMS + AntiSparkSwitch + Voltage Meter + On/OFF Switch.

All the boxes were 3D printed.

More pics would be welcome.. kind of hard to distinguish how the plastic enclosures look in real life.. first pic also does not really show how packs are attached connected together
