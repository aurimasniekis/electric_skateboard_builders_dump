Hi, 

I procrastinated many weeks about whether or not to solder 18650 batteries. I tried many combinations (solder, wire and flux / acid) to find the quickest method to solder these cells together. I'm pretty proud of the outcome (less than one second contact time and to tear the connection apart you need really significant forces and the battery can gives up millimeter or two when applying a huge pull)

Items needed:
- A quality 80w soldering iron
- LÃ¶twasser (soldering acid)
- Stranded copper wire, I took mine apart from an audio cable
- Leaded solder
- The actual cells

What I couldn't demonstrate in the video is how I applied pressure to the joint with a wooden block to really maximize the surface area of the contact. Please enjoy the short video!

I've soldered wires to nickel that is welded to a cell but never a bare cell.

That is a totally different story, especially when theres 2-3 layers of nickel
But still soldering is not the solution because to get proper connections the cell needs to get to like 250c or something

Immediately after the connection was made I could place my finger on top of the joint and believe it or not the contact was only slightly warm. The real reason I'm not using a spot welder: cost...

boss level is less than 200$ with the battery to power it, not that expensive if you make more than one pack or sell it after

Agreed with decky and acido. While we appreciate your efforts, this is a dangerous method and is not worth the risk

@PatRocks Is there a specific reason why would this be a dangerous method as I've cardboard-insulated the positive terminals (and sure as hell the copper won't melt through cardboard no matter what). 

Is there something else that would make this a dangerous method?

This is a demonstration on how flexible this kind of installation is. Leaded solder can also withstand the huge forces on a crossbow's bow's tip... Torsional forces are probably something solder can't withstand but I don't see how the contacts would come loose from the 18650's. 

And yes I'm aware of the fact spot welding is a bit safer but I find it interesting to really understand the real differences between spot welding and soldering if done right. Thanks for the inputs guys!

The damage that can be done to the electrolyte by the heat, even for a couple seconds of contact, can mess with the properties of the cell. It can change the internal resistance of each cell, leading to (best case scenario) a pack that drifts more than usual. Additionally, it is risky in terms of electrical connection and may be a critical point of failure. If the contact is compromised, may result in arcing, then heat, and possibly fire. I would never attempt to build a pack without a spot welder.

@PatRocks Is the small difference in internal resistance how relevant as some people have even successfully built well-functioning packs with different cells from different manufacturers. Correct me if I'm wrong - parallel packs (1s6p) difference in cell resistance won't matter so much as the parallel cells are always forming one pack with precisely the same voltage.

And my intention is to never assemble a BMS. I'll always balance charge the pack and monitor it externally and I'll set the low voltage cutoffs etc to the VESC and in addition I'll use low voltage alarm buzzers.

@PatRocks Do you mean that the copper would come apart from the cell by "compromised contact"?

haha, do you guys wanna see the mess i made soldering? turns out good leaded solder has a hard time sticking to cells

These cells are a goner and I'm pretty sure if I paid @psychotiller or @hyperion1 good money to build a pack out of these they wouldn't

The flux is hard after to clean off almost impossible

@FinnishSnowmobiler I'm on your team! Most of my packs have felt the heat of a soldering iron. Skinny strips of nickel just ain't enough! :slight_smile:

I look at my A123 26650, and look at the .20 nickel, and I just can't bear to do do it. 3 packs built with solder, no problemo. I really think soldering is the correct way to go with low p count packs built from high power cells.

Umm I have 4 working packs all made by soldering buswire to cells and then to brass busbars and havent had any issues after 1.5 years. Used 3d printed cases to keep cells separate and used plenty of flux but the solder joints are quite strong. Not sure why you say never solder..

I've never had good results just using the flux built into the solder, no matter how good the solder. Just not aggressive enough to quickly tin nickel plated steel. A non-rosin-based flux (I use Ruby Fluid liquid flux for copper plumbing) is much more aggressive and faster.

Also, I've never met a rosin based flux that either isopropyl alcohol or acetone didn't take right off.

I'm just going to leave this here. Everything is quoted directly from samsung in their datasheets.

"Don't heat partial area of the battery with heated objects such as soldering iron."

"Don't solder on the battery directly."

"The cell should not be soldered directly with other cells. Namely, the cell should be
welded with leads on its terminal and then be soldered with wire or leads to solder."

And consequently:

"Otherwise, it may cause damage of component, such as separator and insulator, by
heat generation."

Keep in mind that there is plastic directly in contact with these components you solder and giving excessive heat WILL cause damage. That is undeniable. There is potential to melt the separator and cause an internal short no matter how brief you solder cells.

These are NOT like soldering lipos, as those have heatsinks temporarily placed between the tabs and the cell during soldering to prevent damage.

Normally I would advise against soldering cells but its not as bad as people think it is. i recall watching a video about someone measuring capacity lost after soldering for an extended time. It only really affects the negative terminal and the loss is negligible if you do it correctly. 

You need a high power iron and tin all parts first.

Not sure why you say never solderâ€¦
[/quote]

Well.. lets see, solder pops and fizzles. He didn't even cover the holes over the positive buttons. What if theres solder/flux that got under the button as a bead and pops off and jingles around and shorts.

I mean, I did say if it worked for him cool. But there's better, safer ways, with less potential fallout risk later down the line. That's all I was saying. Solder away if you wish. But yes, _'I'_ will never solder to cells directly, happy?

this has happened to me before, a little solder bead got caught inside the positive terminal cap.  jiggled it around in there, and POP!  mini solder explosion when it shorted.

my biggest issue with soldering onto cells is NEVER being able to salvage them.  like, weld tabs can be ground off.  solder bead isn't coming off.

As you can see in the video the only time the solder pops is when it's applied to the iron in the first place... When the chemicals burn from the solder and the smoking stops the substance is stable.

P groups die frequently....so one P group dies, may need to rebuild the pack.  or...pack comes to end of life but still has some viable cells inside.  you going to throw those out too?

i've salvaged a number of 25r cells from before 30q's came into favor...using the 25r cells for all manner of non-esk8 related stuff around the house.

How frequently are we talking? 

Obviously it's not quantifiable in the # of days it will take, but what's your estimate?

I'm having my battery built by a professional but I'm still terrified of failiure rate

12s7p btw

With that rational I shouldn't have a failiure ever! ðŸ˜‚

What's a good indicator or a failing pack? I've been assured that it's going to be relatively difficult to pull a 12s7p out of balance, especially when I'll be using lower amounts of amps per motor (40, 45 maybe? I'm not looking for a rocket)


That being said, would you think that I should balance once a week? Once every two weeks? ðŸ¤”

I'll be using a metr module as well as a DieBieMS to look at the technical numbers of my pack, so I think I'll have a good suite of software

E: I guess I could set my cutoff to 40/39v and never worry about it ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” not saying I would disregard taking care of it... I just figure that would significantly lower my chances of failiure by undervolting
