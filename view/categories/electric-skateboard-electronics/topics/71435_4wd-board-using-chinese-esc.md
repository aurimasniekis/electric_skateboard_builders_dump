Hello Everyone :) 

iâ€™ve chinese esc (dual motor type) that you can easily find in aliexpress , i want to use the existing esc with seconed vesc/esc to power the front wheels ..
I saw in oder topic same configuration but with diffrent esc , so i wondered if i can achieve the same with my esc .

 i noticed a connector / terminals in the middle of the circuit â€¦ How can i know if i can use them to connect two conntrollers together â€¦? The seller tried to ask the supplier but he returned without an answer.

Also is it possible to peer the same remote control with two "unsynced" esc's ?

Attaching pictures of the esc â€¦![Capture%20_2018-10-17-00-12-11|539x500](upload://nIrhOCR18rq0oZrN3MRe25revCg.jpeg)

The receiver "module" is build in the esc  :thinking:

Well damn that complicates things don't it

Maybe you can hack 2 controllers together. Daisy chain 2 remotes into one housing

So in the worst case scenario i can glue two remotes together and to connect between there triggers..
