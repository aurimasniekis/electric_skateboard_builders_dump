It all depends on the company some will send you a refund with almost no questions and some will avoid it as much as they can

Well i recently paid out fir focbox , its turned out its undeliverable for end of may , plus then uk delivery time , i need it for july , i dont think the order can be filled so i jave requested a refund , now im getting a 30 day refund bull. As far as i am aware refunds once agreed are to  be paid asap. The actual amount is only 180 pound and cant really see why its taking so long . All i really want to do is take my cash and spend it somewhere else

You bought a pre-order item, so the order will be delayed. They're in high demand and are sold in batches as they're made. Almost all orders are going to have a wait time of at least a month.

> Please note that while we will make every effort for refunds to be processed in the shortest time possible, please allow up to 30 working days for refunds to be fully processed.

It's clearly stated on the website. Do your research before spending money ðŸ™‚

We have refunded your order as I told you that I am going to refund it 100% even if you are out of the initial 7 days safe zone and also you told us that our T &amp; C doesnâ€™t have any legal standings. You are not being funny but itâ€™s kinda funny and ignorant as well :slight_smile:

Also, I have even offered you that we will ship it by the end of May and you will get it before the Mid of June as you said If itâ€™s possible but even though you keep denying it. You donâ€™t even try to confirm with our live support before ordering but still as a gesture of goodwill, try to work this out so you can keep your order and have the product.

Let me clear one thing for sure, Every E-commerce system/online sales platform has a Terms and conditions which have legal standings and itâ€™s mandatory to follow it when you do purchase from their website. In your case, you have agreed to that terms and conditions at the time of order placement already so you are not able to deny it. (If required, I will share the screenshot to prove this point).

Have a good day

Well handled Carl. I will say however that your terms and conditions do not overrule his statutory rights as an EU purchaser. You are legally bound to adhere to statutory rights when selling online into the EU or UK.

I would suggest some research into this. He has the right to an immediate refund for any reason for an online purchase where money did not change hands in person or via a static card machine and he has not received the product. A request for cancellation cannot be refused if he does not have the product.

How that would be enforced without a mountain of cross border litigation costs I don't know however...

I agree with you man but if someone agrees to something legally then I think it will bypass it.
What are your thoughts about that?

I am aware of the EU laws but I do think terms and conditions can't be denied as well, especially for the pre-orders.

Honestly, I think it's a moot point because its unenforceable as I said, without 500 unities worth of litigation costs going into it. 

The law is pretty clear though, the buyers rights overrule the sellers policies, which is why it's called "statutory rights" here. Policies obviously still matter, but rules like taking 30 days to process a refund infringe on our friends consumer rights in the UK.

Like I said though, moot point because you're based in another country and it's not a giant transaction.

I wish Carl and the chaps all the best, in other circumstances id have kept the order it just doesnt fit in my time frame. And terms and conditions printed on a website have no legal value, in the uk a 2 week cooling of period is common place . 
Enforcement is an issue, there is also the court of public opinion.
Although i have to say Carl has my respect, that being dependant on these funds appearing . Yhe saying in ireland being you cant spend what you cant hold in your hand.

Why would you request a refund when the delivery fits your schedule?  Focbox/unity are the good stuff.  Seems like a change of heart rather than a loss of faith in the vendor.  Issues with enertion are expertly handled by @CarlCollins who in my opinion is the boss.  He's just got to mount a hostile takeover.
Get on it Carl.

This is why these types of issues should be handled with the vendor and not in the public eye. 3 things have happened here...

1.  The butter is wrong and should have been Orient. This ain't Walmart it Amazon prime. 
2.  Every other seller is noting the users name and will like not make it easy for the user to buy, tightly so. 
3.  Once again it has been proven that vendor complaints in the public eye never go well for either side and it's a bad way to do business. 

Will people better learn?
