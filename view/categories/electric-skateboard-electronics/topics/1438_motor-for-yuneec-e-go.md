Hello,

I few days ago I bought an used Yuneec board, the motor has been giving me problems, the motor overheats so I can only ride it for a minute or so before it starts getting hot and shuts down. I contacted Yuneec about the issue and they are been nice enough to send me a new motor, while I wait for the new motor now I am wondering that maybe I can look in maybe getting a "better motor" for the board (now don't feel confident with the Yuneec motor), I am not a speed demon, I am just interested in getting from point A to point B, my weight is 180lbs. So I would like to ask if you guys can suggest some motor replacement for the board, hopefully be a plug and play. I have no electronic DIY experience.

My thinking is getting a similar motor (same or close specs) but maybe better quality, again not looking to be speed demon for the moment just want a reliable motor.

Here are the basic specs of the electronics of the board:


Battery	Capacity	7.8AH

Motor	400W	Brushless direct current. Maximum 400W, Average power 150W

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Maybe @RunPlayBack could answer your question since he have a Yuneec longboard as well. I doubt you can fit in another motor in there as Yuneec has a motor cover. I don't have Yuneec my self so I can't confirm anything.

Thanks for the reply, I wouldn't mind to get an after market mount for the motor, that would be an option if is needed in order to put a good motor in there.

Most eboard motors are way over 400W (mine is 2700W), and AC not DC, so you won't just need a new motor, you'll need a new ESC as well.

Yeah,  to replace the motor with something better. You'll need a new speed controller, then new batteries because you'll need more watts to power the new motor.. after you find a new motor mount you will have spent enough money to have just built your own board.

Here is a pic, but also I am willing to use an aftermarket mount if is need it in order to install a motor of similar specs but better quality.

Thank you.

@maucr @laurnts I haven't tried modding the motor/ESC yet and I probably won't. The only mod that seems to be documented and somewhat useful/risky is upgrading the battery which I haven't started yet. To it's credit, Yuneec built a very insular system that works really well together. In your case not so much because of the overheating motor, but that might be attributed to the previous owner. As I work on my DIY builds, I keep the E-GO around as a beginner board for friends who aren't quite ready to go fast. My advice would be to wait for the E-GO stock motor, have fun and put as many miles as you can on it. When you're ready to go faster, your money will be best spent on a DIY build with aftermarket parts. [Check out my build article here][1] if you want to learn more about my experience with the E-GO and moving into DIY.

Hello @RunPlayBack I appreciate your advice, will do as you recommended, yes, I probably been quick to judge the Funnec e-go quality, and yes maybe previous owner didn't take good care, will wait for new motor and we will see how it goes.


Thank you.

Hi again @RunPlayBack I checked out your article, very nice article, and yes, I want to be a better person. I am also new to the FPV scene.

Cheers.

Thanks for reading! The better person stuff is metaphorical :) but hopefully the takeaway is that once you do all the research, there's no right or wrong way of doing your build. You'll be able to figure out what your needs are with a little patience. For me, I wouldn't have discovered what I wanted without the E-GO as a physical point of reference.

The e-go motor is sensored and the ESC is completely custom, it also has the BMS built into it. So modding it requires new motor, new esc, new remote controller, and possible new battery

just a build an eboard!

Best wait for the factory motor. And I would recommend buying an extra motor to have as a spare. There not very expensive. While your at it, get a spare belt. I also owned an Ego as my first E-board and it served me well until I started wanting to go faster and faster.  The Ego is designed for commuting on level roads. But it can handle short hills of 1-2 degs. As long as you don't go trying to climb steep hills, the stock motor should hold up fine.  As RPB and Onloop stated, the Ego's design is totally proprietary and not reliably upgradable.

Hello @Namasaki Thanks for the advice, yes, actually I already order extra belts, my commute is not too bad, mostly flat. I will think about your suggestion in getting an spare motor from Yuneec. Thanks again.

Always feel free to ask question when later on you're at the stage of building your own eBoard.

Hello, 

I got my replacement directly from Yuneec Ego, I contacted them, I was lucky that I still was under warranty so they sent it to me for free but I have to sent the defective one first and the whole thing took like month and half for me to get the replacement motor. Also I have to sent copy of my receipt to proof that I was under warranty.

So if you are under warranty you might be able to get it free but if not then you will have to buy directly from them.

I'd say sell it with all the extra parts and buy/build another board that has better specs. I am not a speed junkie myself, but yuneec just seems too weak to have fun with.

Common misconception. Permanent magnent motors like ours (servo motors as named in industry) are often called dc brushless because the drives used to control them are normally pulse width modulation dc. The impedance of the motor smooths the current to look like an ac sin wave. 

In short, yes our motors are ac, but sometimes named dc brushless just because how we get power to them.
