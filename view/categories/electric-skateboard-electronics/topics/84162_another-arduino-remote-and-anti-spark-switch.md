Hey everybody,

I just thought I would share some pcb's I have been working on, let me know what you think!
Anti-spark switch based off of [vedder anti-spark switch](https://github.com/vedderb/SparkSwitch)![20190213_200625|690x345](upload://p7XFCiXXTjqPp24YmgYNKCMEy29.jpeg) 
Arduino remote based off of the [rolling gehcko remote](https://github.com/RollingGecko/ArduBoardControler) still a work in progress:

Yes, I am using the ATMEGA328P, same used on the nano.

Looks very cool! What software will u use? EDIT: i See... 

I think the 328p is a little underpowered for extended functionality and the huge display in respect to the framerate and cycle time. Thatâ€™s why I switched to the SAMD21. 

Are I able to show a little demo already? 

Nice work!

I was trying to go for simplicity on the software side, but yes there are a lot more capable MCU's out there I agree, probably wouldn't have had to do a boost regulator to 5V either, which is the most difficult thing to  solder on this board. I tried to make it easy for anyone to build with a soldering iron. I am testing it right now and seems to be working well. The big missing link is the enclosure, as I am not very capable in that department.
