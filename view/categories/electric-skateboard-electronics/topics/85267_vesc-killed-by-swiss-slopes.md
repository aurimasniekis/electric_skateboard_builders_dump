Hi guies, I think I killed a vesc 4.12 recently (boohoo), or did I ?
Well I was riding in some slopes next to my house, gently braking (and I'm more your +60kg shrimp that calls itself human) and boom, brakes stopped and nothing responded...
Back home, the vesc couldn't connect to my computer and not light was showing...
Buuuut, after checking closely the vesc, it seems fine, DRV and mostfets looks okay

I don't really not what to look at, or measure with a voltmeter to check if its dead or not, so if some of you could help me with this !
Thanks :cat: (here's a cat)

some of your soldering looks really freaky with that glue, also im guessing this is a may tech vesc.

Haha it is, very very bad thing I made for the bluetooth module, but except the hot glue, it's okay, and I've ridden this a lot, no problemo
let me remember this : 
motor current max : 60A
motor current max brake : -12A
battery current max : 60A
Battery regen : -20A (not sure about this)

Need anything else ?

I'm not sure if mt vesc's can handle 60A. Also what battery were you using? (s count) :slight_smile:

Hmm I know they're rated for 50A but I heard 60A is fine for it 
Battery is a 10S4P from 30q, with a 60A bms

I think you smoked it with 60A and 10s. As far as I know, only the focbox is fine with 60A.. :slight_smile: 
But can you measure the output of your battery (just to be sure) :slight_smile:

Yeah maybe... but why did it died when breaking, why a this very moment ? weird

Maybe you smoked your bms. Do you know the rating of it? (charge/discharge)

60A discharge
But no, I check the voltage and it still show a normal amount
Just checked with a 3s lipo lying around, the vesc doesn't light up, so it's the vesc not the battery (thanks god, such a pain in the ass the battery)

The fact that it still sparks when I plug it without an antispark tells otherwise

That just means that there's a potential difference between both. And some components might still work but I have no idea what exactly is broken... Maybe someone can answer that for you.. :slight_smile:

Well I have other vesc lying on my desk, but I'm too lazy to unscrew my lid off, so I'll probably do it tomorrow or something 
Thanks for your help, I appreciate it

OK... Late to the party.

@Balta_6 Is the Blue light on the vesc still light up (sorry if had been said earlier)?

I think it might be either a blown Can receiver or a MCU.

The first thing to check is if you have a short on C25.

is it possible to have blown a can receiver in single ? Would be surprising but why not

```
Yes... It would be quite surprising!! 

C25 is on the 3.3V, same line as the CanTransceiver and the MCU. Since youâ€™re running a single motor setup, sadly it is most likely a Blow MCU.

Okay, will try that when I'm home !
I just use the multimeter as an ohmmeter, and look for an abnormal value ( which should be ...?)

What Value did you get? 

I was just thinking about it, but one more thing you could check is the 5V. The easy way is to plug a receiver and check if it light up.

You should not be pushing 60a continuous on any vesc 4.12 without cooling, my TB vesc was suffering at 30a

My focbox couldn't even do 50a without throttle I only managed to push 45a on enertion hubs (basically a 6374)

Yeah, I did that and it was beeping, lightly but it was there (and no light from the receiver)
So it shorted out ?
Any idea why ? Just general wearing out ?
Anything doable for it to save it (non expensive or hugely time consuming)
Well thank you !

I never ridden at those amount of amp, it's just the max setting, most of the time I can't go over 30 amp, even pushing it a lot (I'm light so that helps)

[/quote]

Resistance need to be 0ohm for a short. 

But If the receiver doesn't light up also, that does mean that the 5V isn't working, which could be a dead DRV.

Maybe you could check with the multi-meter if you have a 5V, if you have nothing it is probably the DRV that is Blown

on startup you will exceed 60a by a wide margin, I pull 85a on startup (on one focbox) for 3 secs and im only 115 pounds

oh and i feel stupid for guessing its a maytech because it is and it says (mt) on the top of the vesc :man_facepalming:

mabye?? huh thats what my app says, but my abs is limited at 80a, but mabye its raptor hubs, i measured it and its bigger than a 6374

So weird, but no I've never gone all the way to the max in terms of amp, only got 83 mm wheels for 65kg, 60A would launch in the air :wink:

Maybe it's that, so it's been due to a bad parameters

the blob of solder is not where it should be ?
Weird how it got here, and weir that it didn't cause problems before, I havent solder the vesc or heat it enough to melt the solder...

I think @ARetardedPillow is saying because its maytech brand its naturally gonna blow up. Which is not true unless you use FOC mode, that will blow them up for sure. They run fine in BLDC.
