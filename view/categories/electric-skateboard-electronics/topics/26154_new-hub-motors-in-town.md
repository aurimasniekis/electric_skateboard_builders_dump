Found these hubs. https://saite-motor.en.alibaba.com/product/60568362322-215880941/New_electric_skateboard_use_90mm_in_wheel_hub_motor.html?spm=a2700.8304367.0.0.5sMJiI

I have been dealing with this factory before and they're quality is just as good as Maytech. Still rocking a single 6355 motor. But will these hubs last?
