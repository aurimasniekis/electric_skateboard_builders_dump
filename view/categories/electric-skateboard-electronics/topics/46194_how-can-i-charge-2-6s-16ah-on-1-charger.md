Get a parallel connector. What plug are you using?

There is no doubt you know how to make a thread. Now you can learn how to listen to people. If you push a little you can do it.

Mate just slow down. If you read around enough everyone of those questions will be answered very easily. And yes you can charge them both on one charger, just make sure they are at the same voltage when you connect them
