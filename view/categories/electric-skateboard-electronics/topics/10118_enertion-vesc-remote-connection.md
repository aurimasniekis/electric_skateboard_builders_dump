Hi guys,

Just a quick question. I got these VESCs from Enertion and I am not 100% where to connect the remote wires. Comparing this VESC with other previous versions there are two connectors missing. I assume that I have to solder wires to the PCB at the same location (red/blue)!? Or what about the angled pins (green)??? Can't be that hard to include a printout.

Thanks,
Tobias

Green is your friend :slight_smile:

Edit: For ppm that is. UART port seems missing indeed. If you don't use uart you can leave it like that.
