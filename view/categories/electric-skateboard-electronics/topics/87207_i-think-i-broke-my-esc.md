HI guys, i think I broke my esc but not sure how. I connected my battery and run it but it stopped working after a few seconds. I checked with my tester and i can see betwwen the power cables (black and red) there is a short circuit. 

Before buying a new one i want to understand if I did something wrong. 

The battery is a 7S (this one https://www.aliexpress.com/item/LiitoKala-24V-6Ah-7S3P-18650-Battery-29-4-v-6000mAh-BMS-Electric-Bicycle-Moped-Electric-Li/32948273549.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.3da24c4ddipul0)

THe motor is 1820W, specs say ESC: 80A

my esc is (was) 120A (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Wholesale-1pcs-New-120A-Sensored-Brushless-ESC-Speed-Controller-for-1-8-1-10-1-12/32387135771.html)


What do you think, did I do something wrong or it just happened?

thanks!

I think your esc is the problem.  Looking at the reviews on your link, it seems that it works ok for 2s, but not at 3s or 4s.  So, 7s is too much.

If you can afford it, maybe have a look for something like flipsky fsesc.

yes, that's probably that. I thought it was enough looking at amps

Gotta get within that operative voltage. If you did a search on here I'm sure you'll find more escs that you can use, and figure out which one is the best for you

but not sure how

The esc specifications state 2-4s. You connected it to 7s.

Guess it's a good excuse to upgrade to a vesc :slight_smile:
This one is a pretty good budget option:
