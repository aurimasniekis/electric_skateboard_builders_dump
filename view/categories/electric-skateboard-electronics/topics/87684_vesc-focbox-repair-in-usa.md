Hi Folks, 

I am located in Minnesota, USA and I have 2 VESC FOCBOX's that need repair. 
The First VESC powers on and HAS a working LED, but does NOT want to talk to my motors, or computer.
The Second VESC does not power on, and does NOT have a working LED, and does NOT want to talk to my motors or computer. 

I'm not really sure how to go about troubleshooting VESC's that will not communicate.

Message me if you are in the US, and would be able to help me repair these boys for some money. 

Thanks!
