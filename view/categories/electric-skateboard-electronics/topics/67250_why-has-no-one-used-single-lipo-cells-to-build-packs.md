# Why has no one used single lipo cells to build packs

So I've been shopping around for batteries, and I've stumbled over some sellers carrying lipo cells.
The usable cells are going from 200mah 60c cells to 20ah 20c ones.

I was mainly looking at some 10ah 20c continuous cells, looking to make a 10 or 12s out of it.

Is there anyone here that has some experience with this for esk8's? I've used them for smaller projects and tablet repairs or upgrades before, but never more than a 2 s pack.

"everyone" uses lipo, its not really uncommon

they lend themselves to cost effective high amp builds, but tend to fall off in popularity if insane range is your shebang

Especially for e mtb builds itâ€˜s very common here to use lipos.
How you come to the fact that nobody uses them?

I know about lipo packs, going on about building them yourselves out of single cells ðŸ˜… should've probably clarified that sorry

They work fine, just make sure to use a BMS

Here are some guys which took apart 6s cells to fit them under the deck for example.
Itâ€™s also common to use like 4 3s packs to create a 12s. So there is nothing wrong with using 1s 10-12 times in series.
Just use a bms

Okay so I was thinking in the right ways, Thx guys, I've gotten some deal from someone I'll be working with so I'd be able to build a 12s 10ah pack for around 200â‚¬

On another topic, anyone have a bms they would advise for lipos?

You could get it cheaper at bestech direct, but there you need to buy min 2 units

If you wait you can get a better deal on hobbyking when they have a sale on. I got a 12s 5ah for Â£36.

Damn that's a killer deal O.o whish I'd have seen than man, atm I can only find decent-ish batteries (6s 10ah) for around 120 to 150 a piece

Mmm, would like to get a bms that is able to provide the 160a the unity apparently could handle, I'll have a look around on their store

I really doubt youll ever reach 160... even on an EMTB, right? :confused:

seems pretty damn beefy

Sometimes it better to go overkill. Puts less strain on the component making them last longer. However, at 12s, I don't think you would draw anywhere near 160amps but I could be wrong.

Oh I doubt so too, you never know. I prefer not to be cutting down on possibilities. Also as @Octave says, overkill is often better on the components.

In my other hobby, drones, they also said you'd never need anything over a 20a esc and 3s batteries. Right now everyone is at 60a 6s as the new rage ðŸ˜‚ and now it's moving back to ultralight builds for who's a good enough pilot

Thx dude, I don't even have to look as much anymore since this forum, I might end up getting lazy if I don't watch out ðŸ˜…

Just lucky that I was looking for it some days ago too ðŸ˜‰
I think the Ali bms you can get in 100, 200 and 300 a if you look in there shop.
Just canâ€™t say anything about the quality, no reviews here so far.

Well since it's around 5 bucks difference for 200 and 300 I'd prob go with the 300, if they're cheap ING out on components then it can at least handle 160, or should at least... Well I hope so ðŸ˜¥

There is always the option about bypass your bms for charge only and use a fuse up to your requirements instead.
Will save you some money and space in the enclosure, but you lose your overdischarge protection.
And not every bms can be used for charge only.

i don't use them because i can't stack them as efficiently as i can 18650s. I've tried getting over 600 watt hours worth of prismatic lipoly into my box and it doesn't fit. 

i love me some nasty ass lipos though. Running a pair of 6S 10Ah tattus on my beater right now.

Well size wise, I'm planning on making a custom enclose for mbs anyway, and thought the fact that they're loose cells might work out nice, allowing for some small flexible case underneath or a least a decent box on top.

Here is why I don't..

Unless it is in a battery box like a Trampa etc

All traditional longboards made of wood, will flex. Flat lipo packs that flex shift the anode and cathode, and can also cause buckling.  Sure you can make a deck that has no flex, but the feedback is going to be very poor. Even my LY Evo Flexes. 

So you can 
- make a board with 18650s and use wood and have lively feedback from the road.
- make a board that doesn't flex, with flat packs so you don't risk shorting, but feel like you are riding a plank of ass.

I'll take the 18650 with the layers encased in metal always held tightly together, and the lively feedback from the road because I used a proper deck for $1 please.

I made a 10S pack out of these
https://www.ebay.com/itm/20-SPIM08HP-3-7V-8AH-LITHIUM-POLYMER-BATTERIES-25C-200A-SUPER-CELLS-24V-36V-48V/173305036284?hash=item2859c8fdfc:g:QXIAAOSw8~5a72gx.
Takes only 20 minutes to assemble, but had to source #6-32 x 3/16 and large OD #8 washers from Fastenal.
I made an aluminum enclosure for it that mounts underneath my MBS board, filled with PU shipping foam. 
A 10S1P pack weights about 6 pounds, the volumetric energy density sucks ass, but it has minimal voltage sag pumping 20A - 40A into a load. 
Disassembling and Reassembling is really quick and easy with these cells, so I just manually top balance them every once in a while.

Check out this guy he uses single lipos and knows everything about batteries not so much about esk8 though.  His build using single packs is funny and might give you an insight into why they are not used widely.
