Hey y'all,

I'm currently buying parts for my new board and am looking for a remote to use with dual Flipsky 4.12 VESCs. The issue I'm running into is that I've used the nano remote and it feels small, light and cheap. Alternatively I've also seen the trigger style remotes like [this one](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Sports-Skateboard-Radio-Remote-Receiver-Transmitter-2-4GHz-For-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard/32958301846.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.224.3d0f66a5KLHPZD&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_4_10065_10130_10068_10547_319_317_10548_10696_453_10084_454_10083_10618_10139_10307_537_536_10902_10059_10884_10887_321_322_10103,searchweb201603_35,ppcSwitch_0&algo_expid=baf2c0e5-4f6c-46ea-a01a-46a55cb0da6a-32&algo_pvid=baf2c0e5-4f6c-46ea-a01a-46a55cb0da6a&transAbTest=ae803_3) being used a lot but I just prefer the thumbwheel much more. 

Ideally I'd like to find a remote similar to the [new wowgo remote](https://wowgoboard.com/products/wowgo-new-smart-led-screen-electric-skateboard-remote) with an lcd and everything that tries to emulate the boosted remote.

Anyone know of a good remote that I could buy? Everywhere I search seems to be more versions of the same nano remote.

This is the link: http:///esk8-remotes-garbage-or-greatness/

It looks like `` somehow got removed from the original link. I wonder what's going on there.
