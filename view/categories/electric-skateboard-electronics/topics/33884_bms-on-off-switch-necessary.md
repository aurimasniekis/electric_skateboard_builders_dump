Hi All,

I was having trouble getting my batteries to charge and discovered that the On/Off switch wires on my BMS need to be shorted to allow it to charge. It bypasses the BMS for discharge. The question is: Is there any reason why I shouldn't leave the BMS always switched 'On'? I don't really want to add another switch to the board if I don't need it. [THIS](http://www.ebay.com/itm/60A-Lithium-Ion-7S10S13SBleeding-BMS-30A-60A-with-electronic-Switch-BMSOn-Off-/222373438930?var=&hash=item33c67d65d2) is my BMS.

If you bypass the BMS, its on/off switch will do nothing for you

So it's safe to leave the BMS switched on? I'm mostly concerned about the BMS sipping power while the rest of the board is off (loop key pulled) and ending up with an over-discharged battery. I figure it's unlikely, but better to ask.
