As is my personal tradition, every 6 months or so I get interested in building an ESK8 again, each time with more knowledge than the last, hoping that one day I'll pull the trigger and find a price point that I can afford while still having good performance.

My question for you today is will a 7s2p battery work well with a TB VESC and a single belt drive. I'd love to get a li-ion battery because I don't want to deal with lipo's. But I have a 500$ budget and a 10s2p battery taking up half of that isn't ideal, would I run fine with a 7s2p battery?

7s3p would be a better choice as you can push a little more current out of it. what cells are you considering to use?

I don't have a spot welder, so I'd be using [this battery](https://www.mboards.co/collections/batteries-1/products/7s2p-battery-complete-battery-solution) that I have no idea what cells it uses, I haven't found any esk8 part sellers that have 7s3p packs

@RotiiK I would steer clear of Mboards...he is not the person you want to be buying expensive parts from

what other place has good batteries that I can get? I may be able to squeeze something a little better than 7s2p after all, if something fits in my price

Honestly bro, anything less than 10s will feel weak. I would just go with lipos, itâ€™s super easy to hook up a bms for ease of charging

would [this](https://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/standalone-stealth-pack) pack (with their BMS) be adequate and work with the TB VESC?
