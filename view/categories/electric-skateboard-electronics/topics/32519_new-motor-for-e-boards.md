Hi i was just recommending this motor for anyone looking for a cheap powerful motor 
it has built in sensors so low speed operation and hills should be no problem and the dimensions would allow for a twin setup on most boards.

its only Â£33 (about $40) and i have seen no reason why it would be bad (decent wires and swap-able bearings) and you can run it at 50v (12s)

hope this helps some new builders like me who are looking for a cheap setup

By my experience the brand is pretty good. I use Racerstar motors on my race-drone, and they work beautifully.

I ride with a guy who has used nothing but these and loves them.

What pulley should you use with these because of the odd notched shaft?

I have a dual setup with the 200kv motors. My trucks are gulwing sidewinder 2 with evolve hangars and mounts.(Wide)
 I don't think that caliber trucks could fit 2 on though? Pulleys just need a grubscrew to locate on the flat spot. 
Where the motors come from, they sell a 15 tooth pulley which fits these perfectly.

sounds great 

if you do pictures please

it would have a theoretical top speed of 41.3 mph (66.5 kph)
(Kv * 50.4v for 12s = 7056 RPM)
(circumference = 3.14159 * 50mm = 157.0795)
(7056 RPM * circumference = 1108352.952 mm/m)
(1108352.952 / 1000000 = 1.108352952 km/m)
(1.108352952 * 60 = 66.50117712 KM/H)

so that would be shit scary but **way fun** provided you found a controller capable of giving it the beans on startup to get the acceleration you need (DirectDrive has coging problems on startup usually) also a DD setup will probably want a lot of amps when on hills (vesc 6 with forced cooling perhaps?)

seeing all that on paper makes me want to do it now (plus doing a grab test when only running on 17A shows that these things have some serious grunt)
