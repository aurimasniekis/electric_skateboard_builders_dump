I am completely new to eskate building, and I have been looking around for some time already to find a combination of parts that will work. Right now I was thinking about combining a trunigy 190kv 2450w motor, with the enertion Vesc, the Enertion Space cell, 15t and 30t pulleys, combined with a 10mm belt.

Will this work? I was looking if the motor is sensorless, because I would want to start from a compleet still standing position. Does the motor have a sensor?

Next, I would like to set a speed limit to the board. Would this be possible by changing settings in the Vesc?

Thanks!

Well first off, what are you trying to achieve here? Are you gonna be doing hill climbing? What size wheel are you using? How much do you weigh? Those are some of the things to consider.
