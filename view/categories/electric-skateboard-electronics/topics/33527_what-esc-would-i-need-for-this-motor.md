You could you a Vesc or Rc car esc. Have a look at other people's 6s builds and see what they used. I used an Xcar beast esc for my 6s

It all depends on what amp rating your motor is, if your motor draws more amps youll need a higher amp esc. My motor draws 80a on my 6s build and i run a 120a rc car esc.

120-150 amps is recommended, but if you have the money, go for the vesc, its very much worth it.
