Hello, so I just bought all the components for my first esk8 build. The only thing I didn't buy so far is the charger. I bought these batteries https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-3s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html?countrycode=US&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn5nXpN3u1QIVlyOBCh34OgQ9EAQYASABEgIS6fD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds
 I plan on riding the board to school everyday. My lunch break is just about an hour and I can only charge them during the break. So I need to get 2 5000 mah batteries charged in that time. Can anyone recommend a charger or chargers? I would like to keep it under $50 if that is possible.

You're looking for a 6s (25.2v) 5A charger. No recommendations from me though.

If you charge batteries that fast they will quickly lose capacity.  Slower charge = more charge cycles

So would you recommend getting 4 batteries and charging them the night before?

That is what parallel is :slight_smile:.

But yes I recommend you do that, it will be cheaper in the long run.  Make sure you get the exact same batteries that your already using though

Aha, @Jinra builds batteries for a living so he definitely knows better than me, but if I were you I’d still go the parallel route, less hassle of trying to pull out a noisy aluminum charging brick in the middle of lunch

If you get a legit one, you can probably charge your original pack in under an hour if you get a Balance lead adapter.  That’ll allow you to charge both your batteries at once.  A parallel charging board will work too.  5a is 1c so battery life will be perfectly fine.  Basically forget what I said about charging at 5a being bad for batteries earlier

So if the two batteries are in series and I charge them with a balance lead They will be good?

Yes, it will not damage your batteries to charge at 5a. And since 2 3s wired in series is still only 5000mah it will take the same amount of time as one battery to charge.

That is basically what you need.  Just google “3s to 6s balance adapter” and pick one.

YOU MUST CUT THE RED WIRE ON ONE OF THEM TO KEEP FROM DESTROYING YOUR BATTERIES!  I have no idea why it needs to be cut or how to wire one of those things but I bet someone like @lowGuido or @Namasaki or @Jinra would know

Sorry to say but you probably won't make it all the way to school with those batteries running at 6s
Your max range will be about 5 miles or less depending on your weight and the length and steepness of the hills.

@Cpdaly will not have regen braking to help his mileage.
I was trying to give him a safe conservative range which is 5 miles for 6s 5ah
It would be a drag for him to run out 1.5 miles from school and running late.

You’ll have 2 sets of 2 batteries wired in series.  Wiring in parallel would give you only 3s voltage.

You know, if you just get off and walk up those couple hills, you would probably make it to school easily on one battery set and save the extra set for the ride home. then you don't have to charge them at school.

Haha I linked the charging board cause I have no idea how to wire the adapters. Either will work.

I bet if you google it there's a video showing you how to wire that adapter.  Im being dead serious when I say your lipos will smoke and probably burst into flames if you do it wrong.

I think it's the positive on the negative battery in the series.  I'd ask @Namasaki to be sure.

Just read through this topic and first off, WAIT DONT BUY ANYTHING YET! To start with the origin of this thread charging at 1C or 5A for a 5Ah build is fine, yes charging slower is healthier but I charge almost all my LiPo's, (not 18650's) at 1C or higher. My FPV Quad batteries I charge at 2 or 3C maybe even higher, though there meant for that so dont do that here. Next up is the iMax B6 charger, first at 6S the B6 will max out at around 3A so tha'tll take about an hour and a half to charge fully. If you want to charge faster either get a lot more expensive charger or do it the better way   and get a cheap BMS and make your own PSU for it. From what I can tell the VESC is far more efficient than a car ESC which I guess is what your using which means you'll get a lot more range with it. Also charging with the B6 is going to be a pain in the ass, your going to need to either take your board apart or connect a balance lead to it which can get corroded and stuff. I had pretty much the same setup as you seem to have with my original board and all I have form that is regrets. I only ended up spending more money and I wish I had just saved up and built a nice board to begin with. I would have gotten far more use of it and saved a lot more money in the long run. With a RC Car ESC and a 6S 5Ah setup I got 4-5 miles of range and it just wasn't enough. Now with my 6S 10Ah board with a VESC ive gotten upto like 14-15 miles on a single charge. All in all, wait spend some more money and build a nice board, you'll be so happy you did.

Thanks for the advice but I already bought everything. I really just need help pick out my charging method. Would these cables https://www.amazon.com/CSRC-Balancing-Adapter-11-1V-Packs/dp/B01GU9LBMK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1503568687&sr=8-3&keywords=6s+to+2+3s and this charger work https://www.amazon.com/Professional-discharger-Drop-proof-Aluminium-Multi-axis/dp/B00XC62FFC/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&qid=1503569199&sr=8-14&keywords=b6+lipo+charger?

For charging fast I would recommend the ISDT Chargers. You could get the 500W one and have plenty spare power, but a external power supply is needed. I use a modified  used server PSU, just google the model number and find out how to do the mod.

Yeh i would also recommend to get isdt charger.
Search www.banggood.com for it, if u can take 150w version

I dunno what is your total.watthour capacity of your battery, but if you got 150wh battery, u need 150w or so charger.to charge in an hour

Though, would recommend.to.add./ buy bigger battery if possible, charging often will get old fast, especially if you cant ride far enough with what u got

Here it is:
https://m.banggood.com/ISDT-SC-608-150W-8A-MINI-Smart-LCD-Battery-Balance-Charger-p-1057271.html?rmmds=search

Should charge 99wh battery in about 45mins
I think it should be better than "old generation" chargers with small screen and just 4 buttons

Got 14 miles once running it down to about 32v

Can't remember for sure if it was 32v or 33v but no, it did not do any noticeable damage. 
That was for a max mileage test. 
Normally I don't take it below 38v to 36v.

no one said it I think maybe because they are scared to bring it up and have possibly unmonitored cells catching on fire at school but especially with lipos I'm gunna guess you could charge them in like ten minutes.  
  
find the charge c rate of the cells.  figure how many amps its possible to put in them.  get a meanwell or some other "switching power supply" or "linear power supply" that will put out the wattage you want (I like 500 but sure there's some lipos that could do way more),  and also get a "discharge balancer" for 13 bucks at hobbyking or somewhere.  
this is possibly very safe and a common way to charge and balance.  it takes responsibility though.  you did ask the question.  
stay within the charge rate of the cells.  set the power supply to a voltage that will give you some headroom incase you do have an emergency and aren't able to monitor.  maybe 4.10 volts a cell (actually ive read you might end up with longer cell life doing the fast charge but only to this voltage).  and be aware of what your cells are at BEFORE you plug them into the supply and check on them with the attached balancer.

Oh yeah definitely like I said with my drone LiPo's some of them are rated for 15C charging current though I prefer to keep it lower lol.
