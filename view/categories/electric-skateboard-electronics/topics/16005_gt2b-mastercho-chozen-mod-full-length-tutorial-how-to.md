Ok, when I was completing my mod, there was no tutorial like this so I thought I would make my own to help out anyone else doing this. This is going to be a long thread with a TON of pictures to help anyone who is doing this out. I give the highest of praise to @MasterCho for designing this mod and helping me with my issues while completing it. Also props to @JLabs for selling it to me on the [ESK8 Market](http://www.electric-skateboard.market). Finally, I'd like to thank [This](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=71922) Endless Sphere GT2B thread for helping me with the battery mod. One last thing is I apologize for the terrible camera angles/quality/shadows, it is because I had to take all the pictures with my school laptop. Now that that is all out of the way lets get into this!

Here it is with the empty  case next to the big GT2B.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/f/1f5c46d1edf26c3dc8156f30e65787bd4629c9ec.png" width="333" height="500">

The first step is to remove all the screws that hold the GT2B casing together. Just be sure to save a few of the longer ones for future use. There are some under the PCB as well as under the channel three button and the rubber wheel on the steering channel that are slightly more tricky to find. :slight_smile:

Next, disconnect the steering channel as pictured here.

Pop off the sticker with all the names for the different switches and such as well as the plastic casing around the buttons. I would keep this just in case you forget later on what they all do :slight_smile:.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/c/0c3a622f02f48a8b78391d711abd98e3d53efeb5.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Here is the main PCB from the bottom. This is a prime example of the terrible picture angles and shadows that I mentioned before :grin:.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/8/38338334e8e54947112c4a4223b926a7c7e129d1.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Then you will have a small PCB on the trigger portion that you will need to bend flat.

Here is it from the bottom.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/0/909535252f6925364bf2daffb2e8d1effeb610f2.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Test the fitting to the enclosure. It is important to make sure your USB port lines up with the opening in the case, this will be used for charging.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/2/e2dec07162da22db6ba829581aba67c7189e1707.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Next it is time for the battery mod. First step is to remove the sticker, I just used an exacto knife.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/5/a50b72b0fd384a7b25195abc855eca554fd24525.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Then remove some more layers and the plastic box around the battery. IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT TO MARK THE + and - TERMINALS ON THE BATTERY RIGHT AWAY OR TAKE PICTURES SO YOU DON'T MIX THEM UP!
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/3/b39f8e194922020017766eac5060b6c01057c874.jpg" width="690" height="459">

To make the battery fit, you will have to remove this piece from the bottom of the battery... I learned this only after wrapping my battery in duct and electrical tape. :slight_smile:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/4/f45fe34b8afd8b9d14aab2f371dd01a655f0c6e6.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Here are the wires that originally went from the battery to channel three and then to the main PCB. Do not throw these away as you can use them later.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/4/a4f71c8c2e8fb9dfba5845d037027da47819e273.jpg" width="690" height="459">

I cut off the wire connecter that connected directly to the battery port on the PCB.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/7/670977971cfc5873a14db193f4fd012fd5850901.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Here is where the basic soldering comes in, I am not very experienced so if I can do it, you can :slight_smile:. Just put your fattest tip on your iron and quickly (as to not heat up the battery too much) make a pool of solder on each terminal. Then solder the red wire to the positive, and the black to the negative; you will not need the white wire as it was originally used for channel three which is gone now.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/5/85c70b9597aeef8c976ca114eecc0ef9dfe606c9.jpg" width="690" height="459">

As I said before the white wire is not needed so I just cut it off to avoid confusing myself.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/0/105546c843fd09a837fdf78ddbf08b463e39c86f.jpg" width="690" height="459">

The moment of truth... I hook it up, flip the switch aaaaaaaand........... nothing. No LED lights. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/3/e33b3f8b743fb7036785c1a5671709650ec4f87f.jpg" width="690" height="459">

At this point I am very upset and confused. I make a thread and within in hour the mighty @MasterCho spots something unusual...  Have you spotted it yet? No? Maybe the arrow will help :slight_smile: It seems I accidentally let some solder flow onto the opposite terminal. No wonder it didn't work. I scraped it off with the exacto knife and presto! It works! After that I just wrapped it in electrical tape to prevent shorts, as well as make it a tight fit in the case.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/5/25882df34ace024c6fc862ed20049ce34b8e7281.png" width="690" height="459">

Now for one of the final steps, making it all fit. You will need to cut this portion off. The ideal thing to use would be a Dremel cutting disk but I was all out at the time I made this :rage:. Instead I used some mini files and the exacto knife. They were slow but they worked.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/0/e0daebb68dd72923d556fb9d4b2d7eb32c9538fb.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Be careful to cut off enough to make it fit but not too much. If it is slightly too big, I do recommend some small files. It will clog up the file with the plastic but that is the price you have to pay. :grinning:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/9/a9ca190f7374ea6fea415e5f2fceb96d1ff5da0b.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Got mine to fit. I tested the fitting in both halves of the enclosure. I also cut off a little piece that used to be in the circle I marked here to give myself some more room to work with.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/8/98d48162526e62fda89d03c2d4bf8d8a2f408970.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Next you need to mod this hole to make it fit with the hole in the PCB as well as the hole in the back of the enclosure. I am not sure exactly how to do it so I just went crazy with a file until it fit.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/5/05f9591ea283bfdcacc7ec88218fe527a53769d4.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Tested it with the bolt and the nut and it works! Everything is held tightly in place.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/9/b922236499e25b29891e843f6e026d7db995028e.jpg" width="690" height="459">

This bolt didn't have a place for a nut on the inside of the enclose as it threads directly into one of the holes in the other side. I just simply worked it with a hex wrench until it threaded. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/c/6cf0c87ac41e32de5b445021b03dcd5880f5e035.jpg" width="690" height="459">


The USB charging port fits as well.

I was going to run to the hardware store to pick up some small bolts/screws to go in the holes around the edges until my father had an idea... why not try using some of the bolts/screws from the original GT2B casing? So I did... and they fit. I picked the longest ones I could find and they fit perfectly! I am not sure if the all knowing @MasterCho designed it like this but it is very convenient indeed. There are no threads for them in the plastic as expected so simply follow the same procedure as the bolt two pictures back. Go crazy with a screwdriver until they thread themselves :slight_smile:. I thought it would be nice to end with a picture close to the same I started with except with all the electronics switched from the big ugly casing to the beautiful 3D printed one.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/a/0a14417b53d8cd392dd9ec0f0f613a987db94478.jpg" width="690" height="459">

As for my last remarks, I would like to say that I followed the binding procedure in [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-1CZ5wXC4g&t=441s) video and it bound in less than a second. I already had the case together when I did it and I just used a toothpick to punch the bind button down. I have tested the range on the remote and it completely blew my mind. I turned it on in my basement and was still able to control my motor flawlessly through TWO FLOORS AND TWO FLIGHTS OF STAIRS! I don't think range will be an issue with this remote :slight_smile:. I hope that this thread will help people when completing their mods. If you are having issues with them, post them in this thread and I'm sure people will help you straight away. I don't believe that this mod has a proper name besides "MasterCho mod" so I stole the idea of the "ChoZen mod" from [This](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/best-most-reliable-easy-to-do-gt2b-mod/6705) thread. If you have ideas for names I'm sure @MasterCho would love to hear them. I hope I could help and good luck in your GT2B mods everybody!

Brilliant thanks just finished mine..couldn't have done it without a dremel though very tight fit round the trigger had to trim it up where it screws to the 3D printed mould.
Your pictures came in handy while piecing it together good work.

Just received my GT2B, but I don't have a VESC or ESC to pair and test the controller with. Is there any way to check if the controller is working before I take it apart? Or should I just wait until I receive the VESC.
```

## \#13 Posted by: Smorto Posted at: 2017-01-27T20:23:21.674Z Reads: 350

I was in the exact same boat. Received my VESC after I modded my GT2B. I paired it with the receiver by putting a toothpick down the hole in the case and depressing the bind button. No problems thus far. As far as I know the only way to test the **transmitter** would be to hold down the bind button and turn it on. The red LED should blink red indicating that it is looking for the receiver (which it obviously will never find). Obviously also make sure it turns on and is charging before you mod it. I do not know of a way to test the receiver without an ESC though.

@Smorto thanks for the guide, I have my GT2B apart and this thread is helping immensely. @mastercho thanks for responding, and for making this available.

The channel 3 switch appears to be a momentary switch, connecting the white wire to battery negative. Shouldn't be too hard to make it usable.

I hooked up channel 3 on the receiver to the vesc, and wheeee! The effect is a toggle switch, stays full throttle or off.

Oh and I dug this up, the connector for the 3 wire from battery+ch3 switch to the main board, is [JST-PH](http://www.hansenhobbies.com/products/connectors/200mm_P50/200mm_P50_1x3/)

[amazon has a kit](https://www.amazon.com/DFRobot-FIT0299-JST-connector-2-0mm/dp/B00B6WBHGC/?ie=UTF8&qid=1486344189&sr=8-17&keywords=jst-ph) but... eh, hard to see using these anywhere but here.

Hey I soldered on the antenna and every thing but when I was trying to fit everything in the enclosure I might have cut the tip of a track. Am I fucked here? I know it looks messy but everything fit but that little piece so I needed to snip it. There's a red a green and a brown wire and that track goes to the brown.

I guess technically it is designed for the right hand but it will work just fine in your left hand, though it might not quite as comfortable.

Just a quick little update, I added a lanyard type wrist strap to my mod with a piece of paracord. It took me a couple of tries to find the right place the drill the holes and have the paracord go through but I got it :slight_smile:.

As you can see, I experimented with 2 other placements of the second hole before I found the right one for me.

Not to my knowledge, would be cool though. I prefer this enclosure especially for a beginner because it doesn't require as much modification; i.e. less things to screw up.

I drilled mine for a lanyard too. Drilled the hole. Pushed in an RC antenna tube with a little olive oil on it. Then hot glued that inside corner of the remote and tacked the antenna back in. The oil made the tube slide out with ease. I'm also left handed as I'm used to throttle and brakes on RC remotes. It fits my hand perfectly. It's a set it and forget it remote so no need to mess with the pots after anyways and gripping it in the left hand doesn't move any of them. I think the longest part was unskinning the battery.

Not sure if it was you and I that chatted about the lanyard or myself and another. No matter. Great write up :)

Thanks again for putting this thread together, really is quite useful. Even stuck the antenna tube through for the lanyard hole, 3mm drill bit seems like the perfect size for it.

Still waiting on some bits before I can connect everything up on my board, but wanted a way to test this mod. Found some [Arduino code for reading PPM signals from the receiver](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=7167.0), the numbers being printed to serial out seem about the same before and after the mod so I'll take that to mean everything's ok.

Lanyard stolen from the Wii that I'd almost forgot we had.

Thanks @MasterCho for this amazing mod! I attached a Wii lanyard for 1 dollar, drilling with a 1/16 drill bit at an angle. it was hard to get the lanyard in but with a needle i got it in, i wanted it to be a tight fit.  I had a little hic cup with the bms coming off the battery, but I just re soldered and it was all good. Wrapped the battery in tesa tape. the all black looks amazing :heart_eyes:

has anybody used the 3rd channel from the GT2B remote to run for instance Lights or a horn etc? Is the 2nd channel on the pcb where the steering wheel was ?
