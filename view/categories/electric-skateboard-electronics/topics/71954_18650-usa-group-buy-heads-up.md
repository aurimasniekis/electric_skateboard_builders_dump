For the same price you can get 25r cells from nkon which have 20a discharge...

Doesn't seem like a great deal to me

yea saw this too. 

cells not appropriate for low P count packs since it's 10a. 

if doing like a 8P maybe.

I've got about 1k 30q on the way for about $4.15 a cell. keep an eye out.
