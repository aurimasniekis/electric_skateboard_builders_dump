I just received a new FOCBOX and I opened it up to make sure everything inside is ok and found this:

As you can see, some components are misaligned and touching. Is this going to cause a problem when I power it up?

The caps touching are parallel so it's fine though not pretty to look at it.

I might agree with you with capacitors 106 to 108 as the pads seem to be joined, but the other two are separate. Thoughts?

It's the same for both trios, each group per shunt

So you don't feel too bad, heres mine
