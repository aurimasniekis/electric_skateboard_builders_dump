So I saw The Beast trying to find out how to build a battery pack and decided to give it a try to see if it was really as he made it seem (it was not). Now after doing the research i got interested and decided it was about time to switch from Lipo. Now I going to build one and made this plan its pretty crappy but I want to see if there is any issues with it. I am trying to make it as flat as possibly and was wondering if I could solder the batteries in series and only spot weld them in parallel. 


I have an idea in mind for what I want to get for these but want to see what you recommend for a BMS, a cell, Charger, and a spot welder.

cell: read loads of good things about the standard Samsung 18650 30q.

bms: d190 bestech charge only

Ah snap true. But he sold 50 in no time so I guess in a week, there might be already enough interest in another one. Especially since you only need a min of 2 for an order. One thing that I understand but still bugs me is that a few esk8 deciples are allowed to create group buys :upside_down:

apparently any pure nickel from ebay will do fine. 0.15mm is the minimum thickness that allows for proper amp draw - this is what i have read. Dont have own experience yet.

This paired with a cheap car battery is supposed to be one of the better options.
Not really cheap in total though.

[/quote]

These 30a spot welders are a joke. Don't waste your money on it.
30a is not enough power for welding batteries and this welder has a habit of tripping the circuit breaker as well.
I know this first hand.
You need at least a 60a spot welder with multiple pulse.

That diagram is incomplete or simply wrong. 
You need nickel strips on the positive and negative ends of each parallel group

```
That diagram is a zigzag pattern, with the output wires on opposite ends. This leads to long leads and that can lead to voltage spikes. Instead, for my battery pack, I did all of the connections like the outside ones, and as a result my pack ended up "U" shaped, with the output wires on the same end. As long as you insulate between the cells in the middle, it's a more compact setup in my opinion.

do you have a diagram I think i know what your talking about i just want to be sure of it.

I also found this one from longhairyboy does this have the same problem as the first. And how many layers of the nickel strips should i have. Thanks

I also read that sunko spot welders wont work with the typical american house breaker is this true and if so what is alternative.

What I did and I recommend especially for people building their first battery is to do a test weld on a spare battery and then try to pull the strip off with pliers. 
A used alkaline battery can be used for the test.

This is what I did. Keep in mind, the full battery current will flow across those black lines. 

What I would do is spot weld a single layer of nickel strip, and then solder some copper wire or strip across the top of the braid. This is safer than soldering directly to the cells because the heat can only get to the cells through the spot welds. Still, be careful and keep the heat applied to a minimum (Use lots of flux, it helps.)

Take a look in the "fishpaper and cell-level fusing" thread, they have some really good advice for building packs too.

My 10s builds use Lipos with bms and brick charger and they are no harder to maintain than Li-ion packs.

[/quote]


I used the Sunko 60a welder on a 15a breaker running it on the highest output and maximum pulses and it never tripped the breaker.
When I tried to use the cheaper 30a welder, it did trip the breaker.
Probably because the cheaper 30a welders have an inferior transformer and draw more current on the primary side even though they have half the output on the secondary.
I'm not an electronic engineer but thats my guess.

My 30a welder cost about $90
My 60a welder cost about $200
Maybe the Diy welder is the best way to go
