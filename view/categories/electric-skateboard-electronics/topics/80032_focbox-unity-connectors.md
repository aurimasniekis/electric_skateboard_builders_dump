Hi gang
Can anyone point me to the adapters needed for the motor wires and battery connector?  Thanks!

The little "adapter" that came with your unity are 3.5mm bullet connectors. You need to change your motor bullets with the ones than came with the unity.

Also put a xt60 connector on your battery instead of a xt90.

Have a look through this thread and you will see some nice 3.5 - 5.5mm adapters and then as @Indiangummy says change to an xt60 on the battery.  The unity has a very effective antispark built in so even though its always good practice to use an xt90s on a battery its not necessary here.

Xt60 is the one on the unity. Xt90s is the other. Solder wires between.

Thanks guys!

So I took off the heat shrink on one of the old TB ones. Now to get the bullet off. 
 Does that look like it is soldered on?  Just heat and pull?

You've done this before right?

you know that bullets connectors are soldered right? you'll have to hit 350F for the solder to melt (for most solders) and you don't pull, once solder is hot enough the bullet should just fall off due to gravity.

No. That’s why I’m asking. Haha

Just got my first soldering set a few months ago.  

Thanks all!

Yea, it's soldered. You know because of the soldering. I don't know how to say that without sounding sarcastic. That is solder. Anyway, desoldering to me is way tricker, especially without having tools to do so. You're better off making an adapter. I asked this question recently. I can link you to that topic that was linked to me. But basically you want to solder together 3.5mm connector to a 5.5 mm connector and just go with that.

Dude if you have never soldered before I would not recommend trying it on a 250 piece of electronics maybe just send me your unity. I have 3.5mm on my phase wires so it would be best if you sold the unity and use a vesc with the correct bullet connectors on it

Not planning to solder the Unity, but thanks for the offer.

Thanks - yeah - figured as much.  Noob here so that is why I asked.  When I looked at it under a magnifying glass it almost looked like an epoxy of some sort (I used to shape and glass surfboards) - which I thought would be weird - anyway... 
Tried to melt it down with my soldering iron, but it didn't seem to melt at all...  

Thanks for the link - lots of good info.  I might just make an adapter.

try some flux and some desoldering solder, the desoldering solder melts at a lower temp and combines with the high temp solder, or just get a better and wider soldering tip

did you tin your soldering iron before trying to desolder the bullet connectors?

Yes, but perhaps too little...

yeah solder on the tip helps alout, also did you wait like 3 mins before soldering? some irons take a long time to fully heat up

I put a male 3.5mm connector into the female 5.5 mm connector. Heated it with a large flat tip then loaded that sucker up with solder. Make sure you then use heat shrink to cover it up.

That is not epoxy it is solder make sure you don’t have cold solder joints as they will break and you will pretty much destroy the motor and unity.

Haven’t had time yet, but going to build a little connector adapter wire with a male 3.5mm side (came with the Unity box), and a female 5.5mm side… just waiting for wire to arrive from ebay
