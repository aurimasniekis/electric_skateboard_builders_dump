Hey guys, just wondering what everyone thinks about putting some sort of tracking device in your board as a simple way to track the board if it were to ever go missing.

...Assuming the they don't open it then and there, that could be enough time to call police, and pursue by yourself if you feel safe enough 

Its obviously an idea with alot of holes, but maybe you guys have some nice ideas that can help flesh this out 

Thanks!

e: If i were to purchase a simple one that functions off a monthly plan, should I stick with an amazon one(over an alibaba/chinese tracking device), so no one is collecting my data and using it for... whatever :rofl:

I have one of these in my AT Evo.

I used a step down converter and took power from my bypassed BMS. I used a text only plan from US Mobile ($4 a month) but I let it run out, and if I ever need to use it I can just pay the 4 bucks and start tracking it again. Works very well in my rural environment.

I ended up putting a switch on the power line tho as it will drain the battery in 1-2 weeks and it dosnt need to be on 24/7

I got this sim starter kit:

### [Starter Kit - Prepaid plans on your phone | US Mobile](https://www.usmobile.com/shop/product/Starter-Kit)

Our Starter Kit lets you to convert your phone into a prepaid phone, and take advantage of US Mobile's affordable plans and save money over time.

It looks like they lowered their price for texting only to $1.50 a month plus a couple dollars in fees.

I also took it out of the plastic case and wrapped it in shrink wrap. It is installed right under my BMS and together they are the height of an 18650 so it worked out perfect. If i get the unity beta 2 to test I will take some pics for you guys (and maybe post a build thread, wait who has time for that lol).

Jlabs has a great method if anyone wants this in the US

Tracker seems like a more obvious search than thief catcher or locator...

Looks really good, unfortunately, its not available in my country :(

E: looks like sigfox is rolled out to New York City area, which is good.... but thats not really great considering there would be huge holes in my safety net (other massive areas of no coverage) :(

Milwaukee tools offers a gps tracker for your tools just in case they get stolen so I bought a pack and put one in my truck and in my board

Works for me but there are better ones I agree, like this one I may pick up. https://logistimatics.com/qbit/?gclid=CjwKCAiA2fjjBRAjEiwAuewS_ejW1Yg2ocLIKsOqWmgnx1veoj5jgqMho5W6Yr6GnpLKciOQBq79sxoC2AAQAvD_BwE

This worked great for me.  Used my own prepaid sim so cant use the app but I can call the number and gives me a google map precise location.   Hardwired to charge while riding.

This one is really cool.  I just recieved one to test but with GSM fading in the future they make a new ZX808 running android 5.  Very small as well

most accurate and user friendly yet is locked.  Use included sim, sign up, pay your life away"joking."    You can also use basic text commands without the proprietary app.   speedtalk has been working well for me is Seattle.  Yon now can find cheaper proprietary trackers with true gps on amazon.   Ill link some
