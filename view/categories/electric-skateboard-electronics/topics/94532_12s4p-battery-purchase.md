Not really a good price its just welded cells theres no BMS.

A good price for a 12s4p 30q built is $400. GL finding a good battery under thar price.

A $7.5 cell price point isn't bad for a ready made pack of 30Q, BMS's aren't too pricey. That said, I can make my own for half the cost.

Mine came out to around 420. The labor itself was only 130... everything else was the cost of materials... batteries, wires, nickel strips, pcb’s, fishpaper, heat shrink, connectors, and lets not forget a bms

@Tinp123 built me a 12s5p for 350 euro so a 12s4p will be probably 300 euro so 334$

I would bet quite a bit that thats just a redressed Matrix battery pack. I would buy it directly from Matrix if possible. Its likely going to take longer to arrive.... but If you can save a few bones and cut out the middle man :man_shrugging:
