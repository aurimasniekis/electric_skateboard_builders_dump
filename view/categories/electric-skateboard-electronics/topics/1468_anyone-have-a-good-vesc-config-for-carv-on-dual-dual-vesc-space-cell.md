I know a few of you guys are using the carvon's with space cell and vesc's. I'm wondering if anyone could upload their config file for me? Alternatively, I can research all the variables and mess with it to find the right values, but I know some of you have already done that work, and there may be others in my same position looking for this information. Any help from other carvon riders, thank you very much.

[I posted my single settings here][1]. You can probably use that as a base and adjust from there. I'm working on a dual as well but patiently waiting for my Space Cell and VESC's.
