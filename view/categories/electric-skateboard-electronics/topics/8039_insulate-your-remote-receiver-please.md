After having seen several shorted VESCs by not insulated  receivers I highly recommend everybody to check again and to either use shrink tube or tape to insulate those pins sticking out of the receiver. 

All of the pins are carrying power and they will definitely short your electronics if they touch anything in the box. So better cover them!

Thanks for the heads up. Do you know what may cause a receiver to get super hot and then stop working?

Things get hot and stop working from too much power going where it shouldn't. If liquid got in the receiver, that will cause it, or anything else that would send more power than its rated for to go somewhere it shouldn't be going.
