Having problems with maytech vesc and controller. When i'm riding and keep the controller stil while squeezing the trigger, it works fine. But when i move my arm around while squeezing the trigger, i get sudden jerks, has anyone had these issues, if so, can you share the fix?

I was going 21mph and i had no brakes also, completely lost the signal from vesc and controller, i was lucky there were no cars coming, it was very scary.

This controller is known to be very reliable. I use them myself.
Make sure you have good batteries either alkaline or non rechargeable Lithium AA's
I use Lithium AA's and they last for up to a year.
Don't use rechargeable nicads or Nickel Metal Hydrides. They are not 1.5v
If that's not the issue then try re-locating the receiver and ant. 
Also, if you are using a carbon fiber deck or enclosure, carbon fiber is known to obstruct RF signals.
