I'm currently on my first build. I would like to know if 2 of these batteries --

Thanks.

that should work, what's your ESC? A lot of people recommend a 6374 (instead of the 6364) but if you're light and/or not taking on big hills, you'll be fine.

btw the sk3 you chose is out of stock for the US retailer, not sure where you're from but global shipping costs from HobbyKing are hefty.

I'm using the DIYelectric vesc -- diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/

I weigh somewhere between 160 and 170 lbs, and will be going up some moderate hills. Do you think this would be a better pair? -- https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html -- https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-compact-2700mah-5s-25c-lipo-pack.html

Sounds good! You probably want a higher mAh battery (5000+ mAh).

I found this one -- https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-5s-20c-lipo-pack.html -- It seems good, but won't it surpass the max load rating on the motor?

Thanks for the help.
