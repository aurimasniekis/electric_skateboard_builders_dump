I might be intrested in those

I am new to building electric skateboards.
T he cont. Current - if i have two hub motors, that each have a max current of 22A. So would these be ok with this esc?

And for the 92$, you can connect 2 motors into it?

Hi this ESC is to weak for 2 times 22A. It can handle 30A constant not 44A

this is the one you want 

https://wholesaler.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-electric-skateboard-dual-motor-speed_60680320815.html

it's 30a x 2 with a claimed burst of 240a x 2 .   the burst seems a bit high but the Max Continuous discharge of 30x2 = 60a  should be fine for you're hubs.    Are you running the Maytech 800w 90mm hub motors?  if so,  these were pretty much made for those and should work perfect

Oh cool. Yes i do have the 90 mm maytech hubs. I'm glad there are such helpful people out there. And as i understood i only have to buy 1 of this to connect 2 motors into it right?

correct - the single ESC supports two motors.  They even have a method of connecting two of these ESC's with a pairing cable to run as 4wd

hmmm... this might actually work for a minute before it dies. Probably ideal for a 9 or 10S beginner board.

For the original one there are 3 speed limits

THIS REMOTE INCLUDES 3 SPEEDS
SLOW 13.5 KMH (8.3MPH)
MEDIUM 27 KMH (16.7MPH)
FAST 36 KM (22.3694MPH)

If fast is 36 that is okay but i'm not using a hub motor

would it be possible to just use one hub motor with this... until later upgrading to 2 hub motors???

i only have one hub motor and the single hub motor truck... 

would this screw up the battery or something? or would it just mean less power but more range because less amp draw...  i dont plan on going up hills i just need a proof of concept

or are the single esc better for this... and how does one wire 2 esc to a battery? 

thanks
```
