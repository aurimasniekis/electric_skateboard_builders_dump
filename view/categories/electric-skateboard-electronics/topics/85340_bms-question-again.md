Hey guys I know there are several topics about bms but I am afraid of doing sth wrong 
hope someone can help me out.

I ordered this bms for my 2x 6s 8000mah 30c lipos in series http://www.batterysupports.com/44v-48v-504v-12s-80a-12x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-392.html

So Iam right the bms balances from 2.9v to 4.2v?
Is there a way to tell the bms to balance from 3.3 to 4.1v so the lipo doesent get drained that much?
Or do you guys think thats not even necessary?

```
those values are hardware fixed settings.
you can have a look on the bestech site.
they offer a range of values you can choose by your own when ordering the bms. 
After they produced your bms the values also fixed and you can´t change it anymore.
If you want a bms where you can change the values, you can have a look at smart bms.

There is too less information on the bms you linked but i doubt that the bms is balancing form 2.9V till 4.2V.
it´s more the max and min voltage range the bms monitor the cell and cut off in case one cell come out of this.
I guess the bms doesn´t start balancing before 3.9V or even higher.
