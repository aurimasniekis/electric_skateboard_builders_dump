Oh ... I'm sorry. My wife does not want to do repairs in the room indoors. So it should look clean. I painted it to look clean.:weary:

I did a similar thing on my board with an attiny85. Also used a spare PPM channel to do high/low switching for the front headlight.

No fancy led strip tho, just working headlights and tail lights.

Sorry, I was really confused about the coloring. Make me think it was actually aluminum for a second, guess he hasn't ridden much yet.

That's a 'T Board Factory' motor mount system (with 3D printed motor covers) built in Korea, for the Gullwing Sidewinder II truck (as far as I know, is the only dedicated e-mount available for that truck in the world). When he reffers to 'his friend' I think he is refferring to another forum member,  @wspark

PS: if any of you are wondering about the mount... tag price is $ 200 dolores! :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

How'd you get your helmet to light up with the brakes?

I'd guess bluetooth or some other radio link.
