Hi, I was wondering what I have to spend the most money on?

I planning on building a dual motor build.
The motors is from hobbyking: 192 kv 6374 for both about 180€ and the ESC is from flipsky it is a dual Vesc 6.6 that cost 250$. The battery I will be using is probably two 6s 2p wired In series batteries. 
But I don't know if for example the ESC is overkill or if I need to spend more money on batteries.

You should spend the most on the protective gear. Other than that, it depends solely on your preferences. If you need more range, spend more on batteries. If you need more comfort, spend more on wheels, etc. I don't think there's a simple universal answer.

(Retracted my opinion about the vesc/battery combination, I seem to know nothing about it)

Nice budget! For that price you can build something nice. 

Any preference? Any sort deck in your mind?

Do you like speed or torque?
Range?

You know hes going to be running 12S right? 2 x 6S2P batteries wired in series is a 12S2P battery.  I think the VESC is fine!

It is not overkill in fact, cause it he does not replace some components on the 4.20 then it will be cut out if you go above 30a

In fact there is no such thing as overkill

I would like it to go very fast, I planning on buying 110mm wheels with 218mm trucks and 15mm belt. The link for the kit:
https:///products/dual-motor-mechanical-kit?variant=712352301079

And I don't really know what deck I will need, I don't think I can make the build with two enclosures with a flexy deck, so I think I will need some sort of stiff deck.

Any suggestions on better Lipo/ li ion batteries I can spend about 350$ on batteries.

Why not 2 of this for 350$ ?

I have built high performance boards for dirt cheap by avoiding kits like that. It may take an extra 2 hours to source parts, but i save $500+ easily

you can´t compair your e-MTB with somebodys street board. the range will be way different.
the 12s 12Ah pack has 537Wh. With an average consumption of 18Wh/km (which should be already much for a steet board) he still get 30km out of them.

Yes, \
**serial connection :** change voltage, capacity stays the same \
serial : 2 X 6S1P --> **12S**1P \
serial : 2 X 6S2P --> 12S**2P** \

**parallel connection :** voltage stays the same, capacity change \
parallel : 2 X 6S1P --> **6S**2P \
parallel : 2 X 6S2P --> 6S**4P** \

serial and parallel connections can be mixed :  change voltage and capacity \
parallel : **3** X (serial : 2 X 6S1P --> **12S**1P) --> 12S**3P** \
serial : **2** X (parallel : 2 X 6S2P --> 6S**4P**) --> **12S**4P \
parallel : **2** X (serial : 2 X 6S2P --> **12**S2P) --> 12S**4P** 

etc... I think you got this thing, if not, read a bit about lipos and all will be clearer

I disagree...

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/making-the-a200s-16s-200a-high-powered-vesc-hw6/50654

That is a pretty overkill vesc...  13,440 watts per motor is very much overkill! haha.

Now imagine a 4wd at 53,760 watts...

Still disagree. No such thing as overkill.

I'm strapping a 13s10p on a hummie deck on a street build that can go 100miles if I stretch it

And I don't even consider that overkill

My sentiment exactly!  Lol.  Plus, that Trampa VESC 6 variation does like 16s and 300 volts.  I think the A200S is a much more practical choice, plus it's half the cost!  Just my opinion though.

The link to the A200S is in the post just a few up from this one.  In short though, I know the last iteration they made said it was for 16s, but I spoke with them specifically about this, and they said it could actually do 18s no problem, (and that was just their second iteration.  Their either on their third or fourth at the moment, but they run roughly 450£.  They are variants of the VESC 6, but they made them specifically for high powered fighting robots.  As far as I've seen, they are in my opinion, the most capable, high performance ESC's one can get.  I guess I can't really compare it directly to Trampas €1000 VESC 6 variation, but from what I've read thus far, I would go with these A200S versions without question over the Trampa one. It has nothing to do with the cost either.   Their much smaller then Trampas, they can handle more power, they don't require each of the three phases requiring three cables which, even though they have a good reason for doing so, it seems like quite a headache to set up.  Then of course, they are half the cost.  My dream build involves a 4WD setup with these, along with gear drives that are powered by 80-100mm in diameter motors, that are using either Samsung 30T or 40T 21700 cells.  I don't know how big a 4WD Trampa setup would be if using their massive varients, but I'm pretty sure it's much more space then the A200S..

How that is not overkill, its overkill just in weight lol
If thats a 30q battery thats 5,7kg just in batteries!

I couldn't agree more..  Money is the issue atm for finishing it.  Still, a guy can dream.  A POS car that runs can get you from point A to B, but that doesn't mean many wouldn't prefer a Ferrari or similar, lol.  That's my main point I guess.
