Found out a wire in one of my motor got damaged, but everything works just fine. Should I be worried about it? If so, how would I fix it? Solder it....back?

is it cut or just scraped ( can't really see from the pic )  ? if cut and you feel some stuttering while riding, then know that your motor needs rewinding. U might not feel it though because u have a dual setup. Anyway if you feel it stuttering while riding, know that your motor is gone..

i strongly recommend rewinding the motor. It is the cheapest option you have and it is not rocket science.
