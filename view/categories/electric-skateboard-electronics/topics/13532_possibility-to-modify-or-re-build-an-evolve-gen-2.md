Hey, I am interested in some DIY parts on Enertion and DIY and I was wondering if anyone here hasmodified an Evolution Gen2 with either a larger motor and re-programmed the current VSEC installed or swapped out the VESC that handles more power on the current motor? Or possibly swap out the motor and Vsec over all for a dual setup and keep the battery and such from Evolve.

I just came across a Gen 2 for a really good deal and would like to modify it to be more snappy on the streets. Any info would be so helpful..

Thanks,
Chris

@Enigmacpl03 Someone did a battery mod of the Evolve Carbon (gen 1) a while back. It might have been on EndlessSphere.
