Has anyone made or used a remote that uses a slider instead of a trigger or nunchuck-style thumb control? I came across this on the 'e-go' board site, seems like it could allow for finer control, and more hands-off/relaxed cruising along flat terrain?

Yes, I like this control more than the evolve or enertion ones.

You can modify a gt2b with a sliding 5k ohm pot
