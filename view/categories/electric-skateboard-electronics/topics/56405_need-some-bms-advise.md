hello i'm looking found some BMS, but i need some advice.
I will use a 12S1P and can i use a 2 bms 6S or i need a 12S.
And i found some bms "just" for Li Ion, or li po.... i think i will use a Lifepo4 cells. i have to buy a specific for the cells?

Would go for a quality bms if ur discharging and charging like bestech. If ur bypassing discharge then u could buy the one from China but the monitor the voltage
