Can anyone give me some insight on using a battery like this? https://m.alibaba.com/product/60645487808/Electric-Skateboard-Battery-Pack-36V-8Ah.html?spm=a2706.7843667.1998817009.24.RbRc0G#show_specifications

It's cheap and seems to be good

Hit up Hong Hao Sheng or Smartec. They can do custom batteries and I have had good experience with them.
