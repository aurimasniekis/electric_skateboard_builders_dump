https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/help-making-a-custom-battery-charger/12218ve been watching this thread with hope of updates, parts list, and that many more would be available to those who have boards with different voltages. Unfortunately nothing but today came accross the old thread and decided to look it up and saw many things on buck boost converters but only 1 video of someone making what I think would b useful. I could be wrong I know nothing of these electronics but it look simple enough to put together. If anyone can help me figure this out it would be awesome. Let me know if this video contains the item I think would be very useful here for those builders that dont plan on stopping and are making diverse boards all u guys' help is appreciated because the only other option on this is a $350 charger that is just too pricey. Thanks
