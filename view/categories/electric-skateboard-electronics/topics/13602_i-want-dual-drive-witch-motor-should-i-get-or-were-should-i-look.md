I've loved my dual [6355s from DIY](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv/), but since having it a few times and after seeing Enertion's new hub motors, I've thought a number of times if I should have gotten hubs...just something to think about :)

I have 6354 motors in stock and ready to ship. PM me if you want a promo code https://electric-skateboard.market/product/190kv-sensored-motor-6354-6374/

How did this get flagged as spam? The guy is looking for motors. It is no where near that.
