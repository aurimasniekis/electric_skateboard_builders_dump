All my other Android devices can see my Bluetooth Module/FOC....but my Pixel 2 XL cannot.

Anyone else having this problem? Anyone have any solutions? Maybe a tweek in developer settings?

Or are they just incompatible?

Bluetooth module purchased from Ali Express on recommendation from user with no issues.

I have a Pixel 2 XL and could not connect to the BT-05 module. But there is a different version I got from a friend where it is a MLT BT-05 and it connects to my Pixel 2 XL.
Hope this helps
