I just flashed my firmware with Ackmaniac's firmware and now when I open up my BT app on my phone and try to connect, the app shows the BT module as connected, but it doesnt show the version, or says in the other app that it is "Getting Version". 
The eboard spins and operates normally, any help as to what the issue could be would be greatly appreciated! :slight_smile:

I downloaded this from Ackmaniac's thread:

I flashed my VESC with "ACKMANIAC_ESC_TOOL_3_102"

Is the Baud set to 9600?

Yes, it is. :slight_smile:
I will double check though.

If it is, also try deleting the app and reinstall maybe?

Agh... Silly mistake, forgot to select "PPM and UART" in app settings when I flashed the firmware... :laughing:
Thanks for helping though!
