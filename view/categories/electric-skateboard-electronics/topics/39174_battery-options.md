I'm currently looking into buying a new battery for my board. I'm running a single 190kv turnigy sk3 and a VESC. My options are:
-9s2p
-12s2p

What kind of differences can i expect from these two batteries?

Go for the 12s2p If want to spend a little more. You'll get both greater range, top speed and your system will run more efficient
