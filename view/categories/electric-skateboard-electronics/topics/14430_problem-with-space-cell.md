Hello Guys, 

I have this battery since not even one month and since this morning the board have a very strange behaviour. 

The battery works but it will switch off automatically for no reason, It's unridable. It will always go off and off. so weird. @onloop Have you ever had this issue ? https://we.tl/O5MzOoCBmI

And I wondered I ordered the battery in late september why I have the  old not practical on/off switch ? 
Thanks very much :slight_smile:

That switch is the new switch from the push button one. There is no new swtch version now.

It may be the BMS. You could open it up or send it to Enertion. Probably better to send to them though. Ask @onloop
