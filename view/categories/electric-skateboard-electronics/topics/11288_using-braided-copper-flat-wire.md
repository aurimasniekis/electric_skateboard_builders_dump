Was wondering if it would be possible to use braided copper flat wire to connect my battery to the VESC -I plan on splitting my components like for example the boosted board and then running the flat wire in between the deck and the grip tape. https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/121941390358

Yes, it is possible to use Flat wire... They are already a few build on this forum using this kind of hardware.
