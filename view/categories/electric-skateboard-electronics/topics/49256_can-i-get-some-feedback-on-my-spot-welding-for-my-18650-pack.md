Hello all, I am building a 10s 4p pack from 18650's. I have my batteries and supplies, but I want to get some community feedback before I weld together the rest of my cells. Here is picture of my practice welds on some dead cells I had:

Thanks!

Can you rip them off?

I'd like to hear as well. Just got a new spot welder and my settings don't leave the burn looking marks and the welds hold great.

It is very difficult to pull them off with pliars

If you can't rip the welds off, you good. Welds look overdone. 

Go slow on the sunko 788H if using the 120V AC version. I've read plenty of review on Chinese spot welders I came to a conclusion these units are not designed to handle the higher current on 120V. Blown triacs or copper traces and stuff. I have something similar to yours, but the 240V with that 50hz transformer because my house is wired for both 120V/240V. The funny thing about using a 50Hz transformer on a 60Hz mains is you lose 20% of peak flux density and the built-in transformer runs cooler as a result of that. You can't run 60Hz equipment on 50Hz mains.

yea i think the pulse length is too much, there shouldn't be haloing around the welds.

try backing off a bit.

So with the Halo around the welds that's just additional heat going into the cell correct?

imagine that the burn marks look about the same underneath the battery pads - you don´t want to damage your cells with puncturing it with to much current. Just try to tweak the settings a bit with old cells. You can also rip off the nickel after a try to see how your cell looks like under the nickel.
My welds look like this:

These weld spots look almost like through holes. Either the current is too high or the material could be nickel plated steel and not pure nickel. How's the spark development looking like. I did some test welds with mu-metal (nickel-iron-copper) and got similar holes and massive sparks ...

The sparks only show up every now and then. Most welds are uneventful.

Because I still had to solder series connections and balance leads.

It's to keep solder splatter out then it will be fish papered over...

Your initial welds look hot.  It's possible you didn't have a solid connection between the strips and the pulse caused the spark elsewhere.  I'd find some more old liion to test on.

By look hot do you mean good or "too hot"?

Was able to reproduce the crazy spark in the meantime with your suggestion. I was welding in kind of an awkward position so the top nickel plate was not making proper contact with the underneath one. 

In future I will make sure I always put enough pressure on the weld. 

Do you know why the Nickel on Nickel weld is so easy to pull off? The one on the battery sticks like hell. I didn't get the feeling like increasing pulse time up to 50ms really made a difference besides larger burn marks. Do I need a stronger car battery?

I'm starting to get the feeling that a 420A Battery is just not powerful enough to weld two sheets of .2mm Nickel together. I think increasing the pulse time is just spreading the heat out instead of creating a more powerful weld in a small spot. Will try to get a better battery and report back.

Ask @darkkevind he uses 320a and said in his YouTube video it is more than powerful

Quick question: I tried to use my V1 Balu spot welder again after like 2 years now and used a 15ms weld time for starters.
Some of the spots look burnt some don't - but what bothers me most is that I can rip the nickel off with pliers. Is that normal? How hard does it have to be to rip them apart?

Ideally you want to rip the nickel and not simply undo the weld, a piece of the nickel should stay on the cell

If you can easily rip it then increase the time a bit, if even increasing you can't get it to stick the current is to low

What are you using as power supply?

Yeah there is some leftover nickel on the cell after prying it off.

I am using a starter battery from a campervan with 95Ah

what increases the durability of the welds:

- make sure your battery is charged fully before welding
- use a strong, high current battery
- clean your welding tips (this is a good one - i had lots of problems in the beginning before i figured this out). Use a file to clean up any black marks on them, so that the copper is nice and fresh again

I spotwelded yesterday with it and had 10 ms for the first nickel layer of 0,15 mm nickel.
Cleaning the tips and charging your batt should do the job, if it worked before.

do you also have the issue of the welder making like 10 spots perfectly fine woithout any spark and then there is one random spot where it burns a hole in the nickel? I am just wondering if my welder has an issue and if I need to replace it with a new one.

Also: I tried to weld two nickel tabs together - even at 15ms I was able to pry them apart quite easily. Is there a trick to welding two layers of nickel?

I don't remember having these issues two years ago for my 10S3P battery :thinking:

Hmm ya, that doesnt sound good and no my welds are all strong and nice.
Like i said i only have problems when my battery is a bit more discharged or when the tips were blackened due to sparks over time.
Two layers of nickel should be doable with 15 ms with mine.
