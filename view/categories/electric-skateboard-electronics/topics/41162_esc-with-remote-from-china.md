Hi everyone

I'm really interested in one of those chinese ESC's with the remote included for a budget board [https://www.ebay.com/itm/single-motor-electric-longboard-skateboard-controller-ESC-Substitute/302546263597?hash=item4671299e2d:m:mGesvI1BOEcyvrLVbfKGQ8Q](https://www.ebay.com/itm/single-motor-electric-longboard-skateboard-controller-ESC-Substitute/302546263597?hash=item4671299e2d:m:mGesvI1BOEcyvrLVbfKGQ8Q), but I usually see them paired with a hub motor.

I was wondering how well it would perform with an outrunner like the Turnigy SK3 for example.
Would this give comparable results as with a vesc? 

Thanks

I did a search for Ebay ESC, which is what most of us call it.  Tons of results.  Click below.
