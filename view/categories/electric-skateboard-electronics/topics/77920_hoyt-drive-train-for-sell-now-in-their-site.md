I was wondering the same thing. But the quality of the whole setup is off the charts quality parts

They make good stuff for sure, I love my Puck remote  I feel like that price is on the high side.

I can say that having held a drive unit in my hands and having ridden their boards a bit, this is a quality drive unit that is not rivaled by any other production board on the market (IMO).

Price is a bit higher than I'd hoped, but keep in mind everything but the trucks were custom designed & manufactured rather than just relabeled. 

(not affiliated with Hoyt, they're local to me and really great guys that are passionate about Esk8)

Its pretty but wow.  The mounts are interesting but the motors look similar if not identical to haggy.  Which coincidentally are the same units hobby king sell for a fraction of the cost.

I love those guys, they are doing some really cool stuff. The puck remotes, they battery covers, the batteries. It's ingenious. That is pricey though.

Same here. Local. I've ridden it. Held it. Hungout with it. Eaten with it. Had beers with it. But that price though...? I know it's custom. And I'm hoping they didn't price it so high that it sways customers away or end up not getting the businesses they want and need. I'm pushing for Hoyt all the way!

I can at least confirm that their motors were custom made for these boards. Not hobbyking or any other rebrand. They absolutely look similar though.

Yeah not sure about that but do like their stuff.  The remote and all the other stuff is cool but if you are going to design a motor from scratch why make it look like the same as the hk.  Just why?  Still not worth a debate at this point lets see what they really are when someone gets them in their hot little hands.

Edit;  The same factory I'm guessing and why not they are great motors.

Hoyt didn't actually design the motors. I think I remember Edwin telling that they work with a drone company that had them already and worked out a deal.

If they are even slightly similar to the hk then cool.  They are a great motor.  I like Hoyt, I really do.  Good solid nicely designed gear.

I would argue ollin's motor mounts are on better than these (considering they have have idlers), but I said it to myself when I saw these the first time, "danm, those are good looking, solid motor mounts".

But the price is crazy high. You can get raptor 2 hubs for less, hummie hubs for less, carvon's for less, even ollin boards mounts with motors for less. All of the pricey parts everyone's been saying are too high, are less exspesive, lol.

I love me quality parts, but there's a thin line between quality at the right price and gouging... Frank knows this very well... Chris does also...

I don't really consider Ollin's work to be production though, in my mind that's still "high end custom".

You make completely valid points. I would personally prefer to pickup a hub unit or even another Kaly gear drive unit at that price. My point was that in the very least, the higher price makes sense because small run custom manufacturing is always going to be spendy starting out. 

You ain't wrong in the least tho, ha.

Edit: the Hoyt drive does have adjustable tensioners though

If literally all the parts were made and assembled in California, then maybe maybe I can swallow the price. But come on theres no way everything is custom.

* caliber 2            $50
* mounts              ?
* belts                  $20
* belt cover          $60
* motors               ?
* clone wheels     $50
* cnc pulleys        $100

$580 for motors and mounts?

Edit. (just taken a proper look at the mounts) Very pretty over engineered loveliness.

They do everything is made in house except the motor which is made by a company right next door to them lol. And they only make motors for them no body else

They're not clones, they're legitimate calibers. Been running the motors on my DIY for quite a while and they're quite ðŸ‘Œ
