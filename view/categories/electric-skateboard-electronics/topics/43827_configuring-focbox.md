So, I am configuring my FOCBOX from Enertion using this handy guide (Linked Below) and it says I should power it up with a lab power supply.  I have a power supply that I use for my battery charger, it says it puts out 13.8 V DC, can I power it up with this?  I just want to make sure because I don't want to hurt this ESC.

The Focboxes are tested in the factory so it should be fine just plugging it into your battery (testing with a lab supply more so apply's to home made vesc's, most manufacturers test them before shipping). but yes, you would be able to power it up with the 13.8v power supply.
