Hey guys,

who of you is running a 3s System?
And which ESCs are you using?

I did for about a week, with a Turnigy Trackstar 150A ESC

I've had a this trackstar before and it shorted at 6s. Got a refund from Hobbyking. Now I want to go for 3s. Someone that I know is using a cheap 3s hobbyking esc for a year now in his board.

I would like to know who else has experience with these or knows a nice alternative.

45A for 3s is VERY low

3s in total? I would run at least 4s as it is not much more expensive. Commonly used rc escs are the hobbyking x-car beast 120A/150A and the fvt 120A.

I ran a 4s system for about 3 months with a 340KV motor friction drive, it is so slow compared to 6s and above it went maybe 20kph max on 4s. If you have  a motor above 400KV and an esc that can take a lot of amps it could be ok If speed isn't what you want.

I switch between 3s and 6s almost daily.  3s in the warehouse, 6s outside or just rolling around. I use a Castle Mamba Monster 2. They are less that 120 at Amazon.  I use 3s 30c batteries from Hobby King, around 30 each I think.

I'm running 3s system, and I bought the 3s from [http://www.genstattu.com/gens-ace-1300mah-11-1v-25c-3s1p-lipo-battery-pack-with-deans-plug.html](http://www.genstattu.com/gens-ace-1300mah-11-1v-25c-3s1p-lipo-battery-pack-with-deans-plug.html)
