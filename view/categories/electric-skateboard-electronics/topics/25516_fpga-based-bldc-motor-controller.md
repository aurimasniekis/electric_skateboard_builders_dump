I am in the process of developing a BLDC motor controller based on an FPGA design. Would anyone be interested in a modular HV motor controller. It will incorporate up to four swappable motor connections and some wireless chip to interface with a remote directly. Would anyone be interested in such an implementation?

Sounds interesting. Can you educate us about what this will do better than say a VESC? Personally I don't have any experience with fpgas but heard that they can do amazing things.

Itâ€™s more of a personal interest... as far as I know itâ€™s will be much easier to scale say from 1 to 2 to 4 motors running off the same chip, and having the ability to integrate other functionality in the same chip. Performance wise, I havenâ€™t seen a VESC yet so I donâ€™t know if it can outperform it, might be slightly faster and consumes less power (but in the grand scheme of this this might not be as big of an advantage). I guess I will find out once I get to build it...

If you can control 4 motors from a single ESC and keep the cost comparable to the VESC you'll make a million bucks ðŸ˜€

This will be something to definitely keep my eye on.

What type of fpga are you thinking of?

Iâ€™m not doing this for the money but if people are interested I can try to find a way how to share it with the community. The cost might be the same or a bit more for the test board but if you buy components by the bulk it gets cheaper. Iâ€™ll try to get an estimate of costs today.

At the moment I have a few Spartan 6 LX9 lying around so Iâ€™ll use them for the initial prototype. If board size will Ben an issue (or 144 pins are too much) Iâ€™ll consider migrating to a Max 10 or an igloo

Is it possible to use that IP in Zynq series?? then you can have both complicated calculation and software on the ARM side along a parallel motor controller.

I do not know anything about FPGAs but i am really eager to learn.

Yes it should be compatible with a Zynq, but as a heads up there is no quad flatpack package for a Zynq and their prices are quite high if you buy just a single chip. You don't need a hard processor in your design as you can synthesis a soft processor such as the microblaze.

This sounds super interesting... I am definitely interested in this! Keep us updated please :)

Do you have any recommended reading material on this topic (books, etc...)?
