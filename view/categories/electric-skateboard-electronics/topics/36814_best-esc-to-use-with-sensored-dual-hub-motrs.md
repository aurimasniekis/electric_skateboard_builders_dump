The ABSOLUTE best esk8-orientated ESC on the market right now is the version 6 VESC, available from Trampaboards.com. A slightly more budget friendly option would be a FOCBOX, which is sold by several different folks here on the forum. Forum member Stewii is also selling his own version of the vesc6 hardware.

6 VESC,

Do they work with dual motors?

Yes, but you have to buy two of them. One esc per motor.

The only "dual esc" I've seen is the one you linked in the beginning. All other escs you'll come across are a 1 esc/1 motor deal. This is good because if you fry one, the other one will still work. If you have a dual esc and something goes wrong, it'll take out both motors.

thats also true, thanks. I will think about it.
P.S. those escs work also with lipos right?

Yeah, lipos are probably the most common battery used with them.

I think that will work pretty good, I got the ebay single motor esc and works good for me.
The one from banggood looks the same as the dual esc from ebay.
Here's the dual: https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F302439713410

Hello Guys 

Maybe this could be be another option controlling the board !

I talk about the esk8 1.1 Controller !!!
This is a really nice working and performing Controller without any playful things you didn't need like the Vesc 6 or FocBox !!
I would buy the Vesc 6 to and then I heard about the esk8 1.1 !!
And I am lucky that I change and buy the esk8 1.1 !!
It have the same or better quality for less of the price from the VESC or FocBox !!
And it's made in Germany !! 
You can find it at esk8.de
Greetings and a nice day !!
