Sometimes sanding and knives just aren't good enough for getting the enamel off copper wires, so I did a bit of research and found this method. So quickly, get to your nearest pharmacist/chemist and buy some dissolvable tablets with Asperin in them. If you live in Australia, try out Disperin, it works well.

WARNING: ASPERIN FUMES ARE NOT GOOD FOR YOU, USE SOMETHING TO COVER YOUR MOUTH AND NOSE!

Steps:
1. Place your wire on top of the tablet and set your soldering station to the temp you require.
2. Place the tip on the wire and it will start to burn off the copper enamel.
3. It will bubble and I would leave it for about 3-5 seconds.
4. Done!

Do you guys know this method? Did you do it differently? Tell me below.

What do you mean by enamel? Does it prevent to solder?

Yeah, it prevents the solder from sticking to the wire.

enamel is basically insulation for copper wire, it's generally used in electromagnets. It is nonconductive and if you try to solder or make an electrical connection to an enameled wire it won't work.

Bringing this back to life because I'm fighting against enamel coating right now. I do not have proper aspiring yet. Did this work with every insulation for you @lox897 ? I shortened the phase wires on an APS motor and the enamel is super resilient... I can't seem to get it down with sandpaper and knife.. Will try to get aspirin tomorrow.

It worked great with an SK3. Probably will work with every other enamel coated wire as well
