So I read on a thread somewhere about someone using a 3d printed hold down for the vesc wires an bottom of board...

I can't find the thread again and can't remember the members name...

Does anyone have an stl file?

I would like to run the 6 phase and 2 sensor wires flat across into enclosure...hold down would be nice...any help?

Thx!

Cool, post a pic when you are done, I'd like to see how it looks.  

My printer is dead at the moment.  I've got so much stuff to print, it sucks to not have one ðŸ˜¢.

I've got Anet A8 that I give up on, turning it into a laser engraver/cutter. My other is a maker select V2, but the control station crapped out, had to send in for repairs.

That would be awesome!  I need a switch plate, phase wire guard and x2 plugs/plates.  All of them are pretty small.  

Are you in the states?  I could send you the stl's and a shipping label when I get into the office tomorrow.
