I am creating this thread for anyone who has made their own battery pack, so we can all come together and help each other make safer boards that don't spontaneously combust. 

Noob or expert we can always improve our methods and designs. 

I was inspired by one dude @RHill051 was humble enough to make such a thread and take on suggestions from the forum to improve his pack. It was really quite a beautiful thing.

And that there are good discussions on this topic but they are spread all over the place in peoples build threads etc. If it's all in one place it will be a more useful reference. 

Also to prevent people riding around with aBOMinations like this. 
![image|690x229](upload://rdAoXhB6NsueYAQ6YmpgG3lAlQQ.jpeg) 

Include several close ups of how everything is connected, where the ballance wires are going so we can give detailed feedback. 

Whether the pack is Lipo / Lion / Tiger / :tiger2: welded or soldered it don't matter. 

And always remember vibration is MUCH worse than you imagine, it will eat all your insulations and crack all your welds! :scream:

Looks good so far, you got ALL the insulations. What is the plan for connecting the cells to each other / the p groups to each other and the balance wires? 

Is the shrink wrap just to hold the fish paper in place? 

Small hot air gun fail. haha. 
![image|288x117](upload://qYjiqXriwZU9HTPOVzGdWt2dmut.jpeg) 

The only potential downside of your design I think is if you push the cells amp limit really hard they will retain the heat for a while.

The purpose of my first thread was to see what I did wrong (or not the best) so I could do it better when I make a pack for my friend. I started the new pack last night.  Here is what I've got so far.![IMG_20181004_101028|666x500](upload://rNXwyM2OfNz3EmBQQvIwHtggy9G.jpeg) ![IMG_20181004_101213|666x500](upload://9h6jxjb8n02bEHCj5fgWdwI82MF.jpeg) 
I rounded the ends of the nickel strips on the positive end of the batteries to prevent the corners from bending in and shorting out. I added the fish paper on the top so I can run the balance wires over them. There was some really good discussion about not crossing balance wires in my thread found [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/looking-for-feedback-on-the-battery-i-built/69287). Really glad to see more battery related discussion!

Looking really clean. :+1: What glue between the cells, hot or silicone? I prefer silicone for heat resistance and flexibility without coming off the cells. 
Are the ballance wires going to the negative side on the P groups?

The only thing that makes me nervous about your pack is balance wires down the side here. Id want to be 100% sure they can NOT move from vibration in this arrangement. Or add some extra insulation.

Here is mine, its a lipo 5000mah 60c / 12s1p, ballance charged. Been using it for about a year so far and I use in torrential rain pretty often. Tropical country. 

It has four 6s ballance plugs as its designed to have battery monitors permanently attached. Which I had for a while and I like the extra safety it provided but there was some issues, they only take power from two cells and will drain them over several days if you just leave the board. Also I didn't waterproof them and they died a couple months ago. Now I just double check all the cells before I un-plug my charger. 

The other thing that I don't like about is I used 18 AWG balance wires and it was too bulky. And maybe its better to have something thinner that can burn up before the batteries do in a short circuit situation. 

I opened the hard cases and filled the inside with epoxy for better water resistance and vibration control. 

The reason it has two loop keys is so I can parallel charge it as one 6s pack. I use the one on the side as on off switch but have to remove both to charge it as a one 6s pack or it shorts the ballance wires. 

My main safety concern is shorting out the wires on the metal enclosure. I have 3 layers of duct tape on it for insulation. Is fish paper waterproof? If so I may switch to that instead.

[quote="RHill051, post:26, topic:70102"]
P.S. while writing this post I really started to question if I have sufficient nickle on the parallel connections‚Ä¶ I would **REALLY** like to get some feedback on this battery related topic :slight_smile: While reading [How much current can nickel strip handle?](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-much-current-can-nickel-strip-handle/43081/13) thread I came across a link to [endless-sphere](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=68005) where I don‚Äôt think I meet their recommendations on either of the batteries I‚Äôve made now :frowning: the strips I have are only .1x8mm which according to the endless-sphere link mean I don‚Äôt even meet the ‚Äúpoor/hot‚Äù cataloger as i expect my board could pull up to 60A based on the VESC settings.
[/quote]
I really only got the one response from @Battosaii and was wondering if there was some additional feedback from others. I think maybe my question got lost in the cell level fusing discussion. 
[quote="Battosaii, post:31, topic:70102, full:true"]
Yeah also remember the ratings on these wires are at way longer lengths, we use mere inches of wire and run short burst of high amps not really constant. My battery will be capable of 160 battery amps constant but I‚Äôll never encounter a situation where I‚Äôll use 160 amps for more than a few seconds at a time.
[/quote]
I'll admit that this has been my hope that with the super short lengths there is far less of an issue here but the last thing I want to do is kill my battery prematurely because the nickel strip is getting really hot during normal use. (when i ride I have a tendency to smash the throttle all the time lol really like the acceleration :grin:)

Well that's my understanding from doing my own reasearch. 

On a side note I didn't have any kapton tape and I found a local supplier in Miami :slight_smile: they specialize in tapes and have any tape any size it was pretty cool. I got 2 rolls of 3/8" tape

This is my 10s4p battery rebuild for the build I posted a couple days ago. That battery used cell level fusing, but I was careless and didn't check for faulty cells, two parallel packs won't charge above 4.1 on two separate BMS's (also when charging each pack individually with an 18650 charger. So, I built a new one with cells that I checked individually, and I will recycle the cells in the original pack for another build. 

This one doesn't use cell level fusing, as it requires a bit more room the way I did it than I prefer (my Hummie deck cutout is the older narrower one). My future packs will use cell level fusing and will take up less horizontal and vertical space than even this pack. I did my best to make sure that the nickel strips wouldn't be able to make their way under the positive terminals. The series connections are flat braided copper for flexibility purposes. I've had bad experiences back when I used nickel strips for the series connections so I moved away from that. 

This is a gluing jig I made from laser cut plywood when I had access to my uni's laser cutter.

Kapton tape insulation. I tried to mimic the way @Deckoz did his insulations on his 13s evo.
![IMG_5925|375x500](upload://9cCKki5zdvw9MTsqvf8rUC8Kqhz.jpeg)

Top spot welds plus solder points (I scratched up the nickel under each solder point. How do these welds look? They seemed pretty strong, but I don't have a frame of reference that isn't my own. My other battery's spot welds used the same settings or ever so slightly shorter pulses, and have held.
![IMG_2942|375x500](upload://2yDFwnduoirUnQASBu2q79N7NIp.jpeg) 
Negative terminal welds
![IMG_7803|375x500](upload://eVjzQStT04z8SbbBaD91CClrgH2.jpeg) 

Soldered the flat copper braid to each solder point. I wrapped the ends of each braid with kapton tape. I think the fraying would get worse with vibrations and make their way into the cells. Balance cables were then soldered, and connections were covered with adhesive back fish paper.
![IMG_5167|375x500](upload://dn7U96ULbr1LcxkqHN1CjSUANES.jpeg)

Here is the battery installed in the board. The cabling is messy, but balance cables are secured with kapton tape to the battery. Also I think soldering and heat shrinking balance cables to jst connectors is one of the worst parts about building batteries.

What if you did your square capton tape method then put a fishpaper ring on top of that? Your right that the rings don't take well to the heat. You see some builds where it got carbonized. But capton is not as abrasion resistant as fishpaper.

@RHill051  At first I did not notice anything amiss. But after a second look I think it would be safer if you had some insulation between the P groups. Like one piece of fishpaper or something. 

*Edit. Thought about this some more, its a little more complicated. If your glue never delaminated between the P groups it "should" be fine as there is no movement. If you did go add some fishpaper between the P groups it would introduce more flex into the pack which could create other issues. Maybe just an extra layer of Kapton between the P groups then glue like you have now would be best for your pack design. Somewhat like what @jasonbhuynh has done.

Fishpaper rings make it harder to get good contact for the weld, as the nickel kind of bows inward.

Yeah it sux that it makes the nickel bend down. I think button top versions are safer as it gives some additional serpation to the negative, but no one uses them as they cost more. :man_shrugging:

Guys I‚Äôd like some feed back too, I‚Äôve just finished a battery, it‚Äôs a Lipo pack so a bit different but similar main issues. It‚Äôs not as slim as I would like (13mm) due to the fish paper curving outwards at the fold. Here‚Äôs some pics anyway

![image|375x500](upload://c4Ph20pccouyXAjVvysAgywnkel.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://i78cCSMP4sWxsXUp3n7HCuyFwNx.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://fVaGjXcTRUIFdz9Z4Qn5FzGwEQ1.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://2VISTyJ8H9atoxpFyHTbtsmdXOl.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://wvG2oJM2utqibzqYTf1Gyt7bYtz.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://cLVqczoBfbk1pvEomCd5uWctEuO.jpeg)

Edit: I just realised there aren‚Äôt any pics of how the balance leads are wired. Basically they are soldered to the right point and then a piece of fish paper covers the connection, the balance leads do NOT run under each bit of fish paper. Instead they run over the top of each piece to reduce chances of shorts

Nope just normal solder worked fine, I roughed up the tabs a little with some sandpaper then applied the soldering iron and made small circles while adding some solder. I tinned all tabs first and then when back adding the wire so the packs got time to cool off during soldering attempts. I also wrapped a wet facecloth around the lipos being soldered to keep them nice and cool, thanks @PatRocks. I also tried to keep soldering times under about 4secs

You can actually see that there's a small fold on one tab for each cell. That's a mechanically staked on nickel tab that's been soldered to, the aluminum is much shorter and folded back.

You will NEED to adhesive tape the pack onto the deck or the enclosure. You cannot by any means have that free floating inside the cavity. Removing wiggle room is also not enough to keep it safe.

Connect it to something along the entire length of the pack with adhesive tape. If it's just held or wedged in there and kind of forward or backwards impact is just going to squeeze (and severely damage over time) the first or last cell in the pack. Learn from my mistake.

Pretty sure it doesn't matter if you got burn marks on nickel to nickel welds. It's impossible to make a good nickel to nickel weld without any burn marks. At least for me.

Hey @skatardude10 I do like the dual balance plugs one for monitoring and one for BMS!
1. I couldnt see if you islolated the balance wires from the cells?
2. You have some white insulation on the positive, what is that? It does not look as thick as fish paper rings. 
3. The red soldered on wires between the P-groups, I would use two smaller gauge wires for the same thing because they require less heat to solder / more flexible / thinner. Or better still braided strap. 
4. Exchange hot glue on cells for silicone for temperature stability in summer etc. 
5. I wish it looked a little neater / prettier :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Hey thanks for the feedback! I'll work on it for my next pack... I have e6000 just didn't want to wait for it to dry. That's a good point, 5, hot glue gets sticky easily. 

As for 1, I don't know how well of an isolator electrical tape is, but I put electrical tape above and below the entire path of each balance lead, and where they cross P groups they dont belong to, I added enough fish paper to cover those P groups, below the electrical tape.

2, I am pretty sure it's fish paper? It's super strong and hard to tear... 

3: good idea, I considered that but wasn't sure how much current I'd need for the P groups. 

5: I like it looking a bit shitty honestly... Probably because I'm jelly of everyone else's beautiful batteries... I tried to make it pretty but it didnt work out very early on and I just said fuck it.

I actually like @rojitor's method of welding a nickel strip to an old cutter blade with different welding times and then look at the bottom of the blade to look at the burn marks. This works very well to find the perfect welding time.

Well, it's a piece of steel welded on with nickel strip. Not good unless you specifically need the button shape or extra length. And it costs more. This is true for most cells meant to be used in packs, and most of the cells we're interested in.

Hi all,

I have a Chargery charger which will do 12s. Here is a picture of the pins on the charger and the balance cable connection diagram for the 12S battery. Please look at how we are hooking up the 12S cells to the two JST-XH 7pin connectors. Does this look right?

Thanks in advance

Hey so I just assembled a 10s3p battery today...

The parallel connections went fine. Wiring the series connections went ok as well.

When I went to plug in the balance wire loom it sparked and the BMS smoked. I did check the voltages on each wire and they were in order (from B0 to B10):

4.38
9.37
14.08
18.77
23.4
28.1
32.8
37.5
42.3
47

Something‚Äôs not right though... why is the voltage so high? I‚Äôm sure all the individual 30q cells only had voltages of 3.42/3.43 when I measured right at the start. Why would three cells in parallel have a higher voltage?

your max cell voltage is 4.2V ... if you increment with 4.7V than something is wrong or you use different cells not 18650s or lipos....

If you have now 4.7V on every cell than they are overcharged.

Thanks guys... so the battery survived the night in the brick tomb.

I measured total pack voltage again this morning and got 42v. Then I replaced the battery in my multimeter (been meaning to do that for a while!)

Got 34.1v across the pack. Balance loom from b0 to b10 goes: 3.42, 6.86, 10.29, 13.71, 17.13, 20.4, 23.8, 27.3, 30.7, 34.1.

I‚Äôm quite relieved. Hardly slept at all last night... checked the pack a couple of times in the night to see if it had combusted/was getting warm.

That doesn‚Äôt explain why the bms fried when I plugged it in. This pack will still live in the brick tomb until all mysteries are revealed.

Don‚Äôt build batteries when you‚Äôre tired!

One thing I didn‚Äôt understood.
You said you measured 42v over the hole pack, but in the same you wrote when you measured the balance leads the max voltage is 34.1v.
Was it just a typo?
To help us to help you it is still necessary that we get some pictures and if you have a wiring diagram according to which you wired the battery to the bms.

I measured 42v - then I changed the batteries in the multimeter and got 34.1v.

34.1v makes sense as it‚Äôs consistent with what the inidividual cells measured as before I started.

Ok battery build thread here goes:

Here‚Äôs the gist of what I‚Äôm trying to achieve:

![image|604x500](upload://kkBZrDy6uEWcA8cmkLJSOqcCSf5.jpeg) 

I grouped the cells in threes and glued them with black hot glue, plus taped the positive ends with kapton tape. Then I spot welded a length of 0.15x8mm pure nickel strip to the positive and negative terminals of each p group. I used fish paper rings on the positive terminals, and trimmed the corners of each strip.

To isolate each p group from its neighbour (and the cells above or below) I cut a piece of 1mm pressed insulation board (like presspahn), and scored a fold in it. Then I shrink wrapped each p group.

![image|375x500](upload://aRNM0yfiCmNLM6bf1RGREY5rM1Y.jpeg)

I then connected each p group using flat, braided copper speaker wire

![image|375x500](upload://iMDmbWpZSV2PBxkYNp3hQf9ACxe.jpeg) 

For the connections between 3 and four, and 7 and 8 I stripped the insulation from the speaker wire and just wired two lengths of copper braid straight down between the groups. Between 5 and 6, I folded the speaker wire in half.

Complete pack photos:

![image|375x500](upload://6v87GzTYb9PWlMKTFmNJsnXVthX.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://dm75GIEYsTpPDDCFNXkX7SGfxhm.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://jAcAzTTnJI5xgB0E5OhjhQTGGqD.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://g3yKwASHoaNbRwGpncI4bBRK30L.jpeg) 

Link to BMS used:

https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/v1L6sad

BMS wiring diagram:

![image|500x500](upload://pz8gvG6uaEL5HTFzw4QHF3PlRxe.jpeg)

It‚Äôs going to be hard to check my BMS wiring, but the key point is that b0 (Black balance wire) is wired to pack negative, and all subsequent balance wires up to b10 have voltages increasing in increments of 3.42v(ish).

One thing that happened when I was wiring up is the battery charge negative made contact with the BMS body and sparked. The balance loom was also loosely touching the BMS balance pins. Because they were only loosely touching, it‚Äôs possible the current sparked across from the balance leads to the wrong part of the bms. 

I think this short significantly damaged the bms. When I connected the balance plug (I think with everything correctly wired) it sparked and smoked.

I‚Äôm no electrical engineer, but I believe it‚Äôs a blown fet?

![image|375x500](upload://k8airllICAxYliH5QZNfgBFmXr.jpeg)  

If the brief short isn‚Äôt to blame, the other explanations are:
- I made a mistake in my wiring; or
- The BMS is junk, and what did I expect for the price?

If the cause of the fault was in fact the short while I was wiring up the bms, this begs the question - what is the recommended order for wiring up a bms? Battery negative first, or balance leads?

[/quote]

Both of these have 10 numbers but you're saying B0 to B10 which is 11 wires.

This sounds like an off-by-one error.

Also the diagram you posted is not correct, B0 should at the same tension (voltage) as B- and B1 should be about 3.5V higher to the positive side

So measuring from B- you should have (assuming all cells are at 3.5V charge level)

(eleven numbers, eleven wires)
B0 - 0.0V
B1 - 3.5V
B2 - 7V
B3 - 10.5V
B4 - 14V
B5 - 17.5V
B6 - 21V
B7 - 24.5V
B8 - 28V
B9 - 31.5V
B10 - 35V

What is the voltage between the big B- wire and the black balance wire (B0) ?  Do you have a photo of the bottom of the BMS?  How about a photo of the plug the balance connector goes into?

I thought someone might mention this... i wasn‚Äôt sure how to write it in a way that wasn‚Äôt confusing.

I left one leg of my multimeter connected to b0, then measured the voltage to b1, b2... b9, b10. I can confirm no voltage drop between battery negative and b0 ( the other end of b0 is soldered to the negative terminal lol).

Here‚Äôs the bottom (other side) of the bms:

Out of curiosity I removed the shrink wrap of a cheap Chinese xt-90 splitter. I was kinda surprised to just find solder in there to bridge the gaps. Is this an ok method of doing it? I was going to make my own one of genuine xt-90s and was wondering if I should use the same method or just make a regular y harness using wires.

[quote="bigben, post:127, topic:70102"]
any advice
[/quote]

I don't think it's necessarily a problem, but something to be considered. Some of the series connections are 2 x nickel, and others are wire braid? I suppose the nickel ones will just bottleneck the pack as a whole rather than causing some kind of uneven discharge.

And I know usually everyone does the parallel welds as first layer, series welds on top of those, but for me I find the nickel-to-nickel doesn't stick quite as well as the nickel-to-battery. I think, I could afford to lose a parallel connection but losing a series weld would be no bueno. So I would do battery -> series weld -> parallel weld. Someone correct me if I'm full of shit.

And something I do when I'm making packs, I put tape on all exposed contacts that I'm not currently working on. I know you'd remove all that for the photo shoot, but thought it might help someone.

I like the welding jig :)

I hope you dont plan on using that for battery welding. In my experience, they don't get hot enough for that application. You have to leave it on the battery for too long. But that's just my personal opinion on it.

Sorry, I meant bottleneck in the abstract technical sense, as in the copper braid is likely many times less resistance than the nickel. I think in real life, you're likely fine.

But in the technical sense, 12mm x 0.15mm nickel strip is good for about 8.5a, and gets warm at about 13 amps, quickly getting hot hot hot above that.

https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=68005

That table on the first post looks very conservative, but several people have run experiments and verified. There's some assumptions about total length of nickel strip for the whole pack, that I'm ignoring to keep it short. :slight_smile: 

I got the 8.5a and 13a, by taking the Pure Nickel 7mm x .3mm line, which has good at 10a and acceptable at 15a. cross sectional area is 7x.3=2.1mm^2.

For good,10a/2.1mm^2 = 4.76a/mm^2.
For acceptable, 15a/2.1mm^2 = 7.14a/mm^2.

Your strip,12mm x 0.15mm is 1.8mm^2. Good is 4.76 x 1.8 = 8.57a. Acceptable is 7.14 x 1.8 = 12.85a.

If you're using 1 strip per cell for series connections, for 30q, you're actually pretty close to the manufacturer spec of 15a continuous.

On a side note, I love this thread, thanks @SimosMCmuffin

Oh oops. From what I've read, which unfortunately is a LOT, brief bursts should be okay. Like maybe 1 second bursts. More than that, things will be getting pretty hot, so you'll go through a lot of heat/cool cycles. Most setups don't really pull huge amps for more than a second or two.

But I've also read about people like @Deckoz running really tiny strips for huge packs, showing telemetry for huge amps, and no ill effects.

Since your pack is already built, maybe get one of those $5 thermocouple probe things, and see how hot the nickel actually gets. Something like this.

current space cell 10s4p 30q is a 60a pack with 60a fuse and xt60? R2 is also set up with 30 battery amps per focbox. So 15a/cell.

I know I read the specs on nickel for the current raptor's 10s4p packs, but can't remember the details... I think it was more than 8x.1 though.

Very few eskate packs meet the standards in that ES table. Based on math and physics I believe those strips get hot (it's hard to measure this with the pack being sealed into the enclosure) but based on chatter in this forum I think the packs hold up for the most part.

I did a few A123 builds which are 1 or 2 parallel cells with huge amps. I stare at my spot welder and piles of nickel strip, and scratch my head. Then I end up putting copper in all series connections.

I'd say hats off to you for:

-isolating P groups
-not crossing balance wires
-labeling your series contacts

I would use shrink wrap instead of entirely kapton tape. Definitely use tape to tie down the balance wires, but you'd be much better off using a thick heat shrink over the entire pack.

I have a single 0.15mm nickel strip on my new pack in MOST places on the pack. My new BMS has two temp sensors that I placed as close to the nickel strips a possible in places I thought would see the most current.

During my testing, the nickel strips haven't even heated up more than a degree or two past ambient temperature. I think it's fine in almost all cases(based on my testing so far). I also do not have any braided wire or anything else on the series connections. 

I always suggest people double or tripple up if possible though, because everyone's riding style is different. I mean, for all i know the person making the pack is going to compete in the uphill race and dump their entire packs capacity in 5 minutes.

EDIT: Battery inf: 10s5p 30Q, dual foc box's set to 40A each for 80A total. Iv'e done a few runs at 50A each box and it yielded similar results.

in case you use a 8-10a charger (i don¬¥t reccomend that, but in case you do), you also can just use a xt60 as charge connector without worring about how to get it sealed right.
just take it out, plug it in, and you good to go.

I bought a roll of I think 25mm wide nickel strip for doublestack or foldover, thinking less points of failure and more current handling.

Can also fold over the top of singlestack p groups, ending up like a pcb pack. Ah I have a partial photo (board is perpetually unfinished...)

There's actually fish paper running under the balance wires. You can kind of see it near the top when the wires take a right turn. Segmented and overlapping (for flex). And the blue square at the top, I printed little wire combs and hotglued onto the fish paper to keep all the wires running clean, and to give a little protection to the wires.

The series joint at the bottom is connected with XT150, giving me the option of using a hobby charger to balance charge or health check each of the 2 sides separately (with a balance lead splitter).

But dammit, the 2 subpacks are joined permanently by one of the balance wires, so can't balance charge both subpacks at the same time.

Normally I'd put a dedicated hobby charger compatible JST on each subpack (7 cell for the left, 6 cell for the right) and make a harness to combine for the 13s bms, but space is so tight tight tight!

Oh and I originally put the fuse and loop key at the bottom on the series join, but that same pesky balance wire keeps things connected in series.

Let me know what I did wrong
[/quote]

I think you used 3/4 scale 30q cells, as that 12s 6p looks absolutely tiny next to your hand! :grin:

I stared at it for a while to try and find an issue but it's pretty damn legit. :ok_hand:

The only thing that makes a little uncomfortable is the corners of the nickel strip on top of the positive insulation rings. Personally id like them to be longer or trimmed shorter so there is no chance of them going under the ring and touching the negative can if the battery was hit hard in a crash or something. Maybe they are already short enough not to be a problem but its hard to tell from the photo.

Thanks, that's interesting, more miles than I thought I'd get :slight_smile:

I did a fair bit of testing, I used a malelectrics car battery version spotwelder, I found that as the voltage dropped the welds were affected quite a lot, so I kept the battery on charge while welding to keep the volts up, this helped a lot with weld consistency.
I found that 18ms was good for the first layer and 35ms for the subsequent layers worked well.

2 nitpicks, and they're pretty picky nitpicks.

1. the series connection with the 180deg bend, those pairs of subpacks may benefit from being stabilized with respect to each other, to avoid wire breaking. Maybe tape/glue them to a small sheet of abs?

2. for each subpack, you have the series connection going down the middle pair of cells, and only nickel to the left and right pairs of cells. That means the middle pair have a very low current series path, and the other pairs have a significantly higher resistance series path. So over time, the middle cells will see more wear, generate more heat (which is trapped in the middle of the pack).

Reference:

I doubt these are going to really be issues though, nice build!

Oh one more thing, I think for packs like this, it would make sense to use one wide piece of nickel that cover all 6 cells, rather than using 5 skinny pieces. It'll be mechanically stronger, and the electrical paths will be more robust. Less work too. :)

[/quote]

IMO 26awg is very delicate, and has to be handled with extreme care especially near the crimps. OTOH if you have a short somewhere because the wire broke, it'll have a very good chance at acting as a fuse and burning itself out before anything more serious happens.

Parallel connection is usually thought of to just carry balancing current. But if you don't have a series connection at each cell, current will flow from cell terminal through nickel to series wire.

For example if you have 1 series connection at the center of a 4p group, and you're pulling 80a from the pack, some of the 0.15mm nickel will see 40a.

Theoretically it makes a difference but in real life, probably won't make a difference.

Just wanted to get some more advise on how these welds look, I think they look great although maybe a little too much power. They are stuck on there proper good, like so good the nickel ripped in half before the welds failed.

Just a pic of the welder I‚Äôve been using. It cos me a total of about $50 AUD or $35 usd, it uses a Chinese welding controller, 1400w microwave transformer and 4awg silicone wire. 

The timing and power is fully adjustable and I‚Äôve found welding nickel to cells works well with 10ms (I assume it is ms) and 85% power. 

Anyway let me know what you think![image|375x500](upload://20dq8PqiqMEoV9JhjgIYl2s5ARz.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://rSfManjzuhpEBPRmOYcegZQoKQq.jpeg)

Edit: I adjusted it down to 82 and these look a bit less burnt, I think I‚Äôll stick at these settings. (Ignore the larger weld on the right, I accidentally double welded that one)

Lol, they aren‚Äôt actually holes. The pic is exaggerated a lot due to the photo, the reason it looks like a hole is because of the small amount of copper left behind from the welding electrodes.

As for being too hot I can‚Äôt seem to get and good welds when turning it down any lower, maybe I‚Äôll try playing with the timing

Some things that have worked for me to get it to stick better -- maybe you can lower your power a bit.

Clean the cell and nickel with alcohol.

Lighten up the pressure on the probes.

Oh and you can reshape the tips with sandpaper.

My first full (practice) go at a 5P group...

I'm planning on cutting the barley paper a little bit wider and longer to wrap around fully next time, partly because I don't know if I trust kapton tape to insulate between the edge of the cell and the balance lead. I'll also be spot welding a couple more shots on each.

Is there anything else I could improve on?

Not really sure. Only running 80a Motor Max and  30a Batt Max per vesc. It's a 30q 10s5p pack so I don't think power is the issue. That braided copper can flex and lead to fraying is all I know. The battery is attached to the deck with no flex.

Well then I might guess mechanical stress from vibration combined with the braid going from stiff soldered area to flexible over a short distance. 

Even though the pack is velcroed to the board, the left and right side of the pack could still vibrate up and down up to 1mm each side. Eventually braking the braid. 

If that is true, a longer section of braid between the two soldered areas would allow for more flex and less stress on the braid.

a longer section of braid between the two soldered areas would allow for more flex and less stress on the braid.

Exactly this or even two strands of 10 gauge silicone wire. That's what we used.

Was that link braid pre tined or plain cooper. 

I suspect the solder flowed to close to were it was flexing and stiffening it all up and putting the flex in one very small. space as it flexed repeatedly in this small area it started braking the strands. Increasing resistance increasing heat and work hardening the copper. This ends up been a self perpetual cycle that escalated untill catistrofick fault you end up with there. This is what I think most likely happened from working on large factry mechinary that vibrates and seen similar results with stranded copper.

I think your better of with the copper braid over the silicon wire just make sure there‚Äôs more space between the stiff soldered area. (I prefer the pre tinned stuff personally as I fined it easya and quicker to get the solder contained were I want it for a better more controlled concetion) 

Disclaimer this is my opinion I‚Äôm sure otheres will have different or contradiction  ones i recommend reading them all and making your own mined up to what you think is best.

Just finished my 12S4P for my new project.

I ordered the 30Q with the Tags from nkon.nl every row of my holder has 8 batteries and there is a total of 6 rows (8x6 = 48 cells = 12s4p). I connected 4 of them in parallel and then connected to the next pair of 4. So it means each row has 2 parallel pairs. For connecting the parallel pairs I used a thicker wire because the tag only would not have a desirable amp rating by itself.

So I just soldered the parallel pairs together with the tags. If you have a soldering iron that can get hot enough and you sand the tags a bit then it will hold up quite well.

Just don‚Äôt want to invest in a spotwelder that I only use once every 2 years.

The case and everything is printed on my 3D Printer (Material PLA)

To improve shock absorption the cells have acrylic and hotglue between the cells.

but it¬¥s the place where the battery flex.
because of this flex the packs can rub on ech other and damage the thin plastic cover around the cells.
as you for sure know the main part of the outer cell is the negative pole. so if two packs damage there isolation next to each other over time you short your packs.

 @Andy87 Thanks for pointing that it i will definitely take that into consideration for future builds and possibly add some fish paper there on this one. however there is kapton tape over the positive cap and there are 2 layers of shrink wrap one over each of the parallel packs that fold inward a bit and covers most of the positive cap and one over the 2 parallel packs that are next to each other so the chances of it shorting that way are very slim.

He's not talking about the caps/terminals.

Fish paper is more abrasion resistant than kapton or shrink wrap.

If you have a connection from positive on one to negative on the next group in series, and the wrap wears between those groups, the cell bodies contact and essentially short positive of the first through the negative (body) of the next which is the negative of the first. It'd be like shorting positive to negative on the first group directly, just via the cell bodies.

My original idea was to use this type of nickel, using one thick tinned copper braid to make series from one pack to another. Max I'll ever draw will be 100, but numbers like that rarely acure. I was thinking of maybe spot welding 2 extra strips on top of this one.

This layout has a nickel strip for each cell. If you add one piece of copper to the middle, withe there being only one cell to either side, the max current each line of nickel will carry is 30a. The path would be longer for the cells on the left and right, so over time the center cell will see more of the demand and wear out faster. Maybe not enough though to make any practical difference.

Personally I don't like the way nickel sticks to nickel spot welded, and try to stay away from stacking. Whatever conductor you add, think about which way electricity flows from group to group. With only one series connection between groups, the parallel connections will have significant current passing through. If you make a series connection one per cell, the parallel connections will have negligent current.

In theory we would want all connections to be copper. We use nickel for reducing heat to cells, and convenience.

If you're soldering one wire, soldering more wires in the same way should not be more harmful.

Typically we solder wire onto nickel between cells to reduce heating of cells.

So, ideally for electrocity, one wire per cell. But for reducing heating effects, one wire between each pair of cells.

Or stack copper across the whole nickel strip then do series copper however you like.

Disclaimer: This is all my opinion, and everyone chooses different trade-offs. I think for a normal urethane board, it's hard to pull more than 60-70 amps from a pack. Me, for high current packs I use lots of copper.

I'm getting ready to make a 12s6p battery, and I made a 3d model to try and show my proposed layout to get some feedback on it:  
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3562379/apps  
  
Each part of the 12 series is a collection of 6 cells, connected together in parallel in a 2x3 config. The series snakes out and back from the terminals. Each series in upside down of the one before it so that nickel strips can be welded on from one series straight across to the next one. The squares on top of the pack represent where the strips are connecting series together. It might be hard to see, but there are some on the bottom of the pack as well that continue the snaking pattern.  
  
 The primary goal of this layout is to eliminate any head to toe connections that would result in nickel strips being bend.   

All connections will be made with a spot welder, and the terminal leads will be soldered onto the nickel strips before being welded to the pack.

  (just image the image is 3x2 instead of 5x2)  

After spot welding each of these 12 segments into **this pattern with one layer of nickel**, I'll use **three strips of nickel and three lines of [this fine braided wire to connect each series together](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Flat-Braided-braid-Tinned-Copper-Wire-1-4-Wide-Ground-Strap-USA-BUY-PER-FT/302037114807?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649)**  
  
Wiring from the battery to ESC is [10 awg braided and silicone insulated wire](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1NU2J6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

For the parallel connections, it should be enough from what I‚Äôve heard. I used wayyy more in my pack but other people haven‚Äôt had issues with how much you are using.

For the series connections, I would probably skip the nickel strip and only use braided copper wire. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true that it can do 32A, but if so, it should be enough while still keeping some flex in the battery.

You could also use copper strip. I have heard it should be pretty good and can draw a lot of amps (more than 100A)

Looking over some of the ampacity charts I've always noticed that copper is lower resistance, thereby able to handle more current before getting hot.  
  
Why don't we all just use copper instead of nickel?

They might be balancing.  Measure the voltage on the cell and the voltage on the P-pack.  If they are off at all, they will immediately begin balancing (charging the lower one, discharging the higher one)

You don't want more than a 0.1V difference and it's better if they are the same before the weld.

Each strand of the tinned copper braid is good for 40A, so I have 3 lines of it connecting each series together. That's fine, right?

I'll double up on those power lines from the battery to ESC. Would it still be ok then have them conjointed back into a single 10 awg wire right before the ESC? The ESC has power input as single 10awg with a xt90 connector. Would it be fine to continue using these or should I desolder them from the ESC's pcb and replace with something more heavy duty?

Yes, that's good for 120A continuous and hundreds of amperes for under ten seconds.

Just make sure if the pack can flex that the braid is set up in such a way it won't fray over time under heavy vibration.

That's approximately equivalent to three 12AWG wires.

You can solder the leads in whatever order (before or after the B- lead) you like as long as you have the BMS plug disconnected. However before plugging in the BMS (the white plug where all the leads go is a JST type plug) you have to connect the B- on the BMS to the battery.

I would proceed like this:

1. Solder the wires from the jst plug to the battery. (not plugged in !!!)
2. Solder the b- to the battery and then the BMS
3. Plug in the jst connector
4. Solder the p- to the BMS and the charging port's -
5. Solder a wire from the battery's  + to the charging port's +

For many of these steps order does not matter however 2 must always be done before 3.

The fuse can be inserted after the charging port either in the - or + pole. It does not matter.

What protection do I need to use 18650 holders?  Plan is 12s4p of 30Q using 12 holders drilled into the deck with tiny wood screws and connecting the tabs on the holders to each other with continuous pieces of 10awg.  Covering with adhesive foam to protect from vibration/abrasion and the enclosure is galvanized sheet steel.  What else do I do?

- wrap cells in more heat shrink
- add fish paper on the positive terminals
- douse the whole thing in type II silicone
- something else

These are the holders I'm using (not exact link but this has dimensions)

MinispotA was $60 + $15 shipping. If you have a high C lipo, that's all you need, otherwise a $45 lipo works. Thats, what, around the cost (or slightly below) of a low quality Sunnko from Amazon? 

Even taking into account a full spot welder for your first build + materials/cells... The cost is around equivalent to buying from a reputable builder. Not to take business from them, not everyone has the time, attention to detail, or desire to build (or even buy) more than a single pack. In those cases I'd say buy- otherwise, equivalent cost with investment in time and research for the first and massive savings after that, totally a spot welder is worth it, I put it off too long.

This is a terrible idea. google it up. steel contacts are very high resistance. If you draw more than like 3 amps it heats up, bends, gets brittle, etcd. Contact gets worse, more heat, meltie meltie.

You say 20-30amp like it's nothing. That is quite a lot of energy.

So I have a real hard time trusting these cheap BMS. I used a stripboard pcb and some male headers to make a parallel board for the balance connectors, then hook up one of those bluetooth smart bms, to monitor cell voltages. I hook it up, then charge through the dumb bms, and can check what's going on. Along with a FLIR to see where the heat is being made.

Lol I usually don't like what I see, and it takes hours and hours, but it lets me understand the behavior.

i'm finding these small bms ineffective for large packs - i mean, balance current on the d140 (and most bms for that matter) is less than 0.01A - so at that rate to balance a, let's say 6p cell or 18Ah cell, that'll take forever.

Less than 0.1A, so it'll take about 10 days to do a full discharge. If we assume balancing will only need to drain 10% then maybe 2 days to balance.

it depends how out of balance it is.

so...let's say cell 5 is like 0.05v below all others, bms will drain all cells except cell 5 down by 0.05v while continuing to charge cell 5 up.

hope that made sense.

If all cells are in balance, bms doesnt go into balance charge, so no heat from resistors. 

Also, check your charger voltage, it should be 50.4v, then when in CV, it should go up to 50.5v - extra voltage needed for balancing.

correct, but bms should correct even a variance of 0.01v. 

when i measure drift in my own packs, all with hundreds of miles on them, they're nearly perfectly balanced.

you actually have to measure voltage with a load, ie when battery's fully charged.

because no load, my chargers show 50.3v too, but when battery's fully charge and it's CV, it goes up to 50.5.v

Is the connector wiring correct?
Incorrect wiring may cause abnormal heat generation.
In my experience, BMS had two patterns due to connector miswiring.
Unusual fever. Not charged.These are 2 patterns .
Just in case, unplug the balance connector and measure the voltage per parallel.
I misordered the balance line in the past and had an unusual fever in BMS.
At that time, 7V was shown during a certain parallel.
Some BMSs detect an abnormal voltage between parallels and do not start charging.
Cheap BMS has no detection function and will charge even if the balance wiring is not correct.

[/quote]

So I think I'm in my own world of pain lol, but here's my opinion. If we're using charge only BMS, we're only using 2 functions. Balancing when charging, which it does a piss poor job of, and cell overvoltage protection during charge, which can give you some indication your pack is out of whack. As everyone is saying, good packs tend to stay in balance. Cheap bms I really don't think they can measure voltage accurately and precisely enough to hit 4.20v on each cell. So whatever calibration drift there is within the BMS is how tightly your pack will be balanced. The smartBMS indicates cell voltage to 3 digits...

Given all this, I think we're better off with a battery monitor. Something that shows you per cell voltage and alarms on over or under voltage and if there's a big gap between cells. Charge to 4.1v per cell, don't balance charge unless warranted.

Or, go full monty bms with discharge, and actually get full protection.

I think diebieMS is the class of the bunch, especialy with METR integration, but only goes to 12s and is large, expensive, and can be hard to get ahold of. The smartbms to me feel cheap, but at least you can see what's going on. They have versions up to like 120a if you have space. The downsides are, they're a bit big, and in some versions, the bluetooth module drain the battery even in standby. Upsides are, bluetooth per cell voltage, can control balancing very well, has a remote LCD available, and @janpom daVEGA can show per cell voltage. Oh and the small one goes to 15s, great for 13s or lifepo4 15s. If you use it for discharge as well, the app has some logging, and I think you can use it as e-switch, and maybe even password lockout your board via app.

If you get a smartBMS, get at least 40a. The lesser ones have fish paper on bottom rather than another aluminum plate.

PS if you're charging to 4.1v per cell consistently the cells do not necessarily need to be balanced. Top balancing (balancing when pack is full) is to prevent any cell from exceeding max charge voltage. At 4.1v you're not in danger. Your pack may be slightly out of balance at 4.1v per cell, but may balance out when it gets to 4.2v. In any case it's good to be able to see per cell voltage so you can manage the pack.

You should be perfectly fine! If it's at 4.19 and the resistors are getting warm it's just bringing the battery into balance :+1:

Well, it really depends on how out of balance it was before it started. You probably just caught it at it's tail wind. 

For the battery to finish balancing from where it's at now, it likely needs 20 to 30 minutes max

If you can't turn your remote off and the board stop applying power (coasting) then the board is unsafe.  Don't ride it until you know how to set your remote's failsafe.

My instructions were specifically for the Mini Remote.  If you don't have that remote, then find the instructions for your specific remote.

The bottom line is, if you can't turn off your remote without your board throttling up, then it's unsafe.

Here is the main thing you really need to know:

If you're asking these questions, you should not yet be building a battery, and definitely not using a battery you built without knowing. 

There's nothing wrong with asking questions. It's how we learn and get good at things. However, this is a question you need to ask BEFORE you build. Lay out your entire process, what you think you're going to do to build your pack, BEFORE building it - then post it and ask for somebody to look over it and give suggestions.

Please don't use this battery. Please go back to the drawing board and look at the pictures of other peoples batteries. Please don't solder a battery like this unless you have years of hobby soldering experience.

Yeah I think I'm being a bit of a dick because I'm really tired.

Soldering just nickel? As long as it properly wetted and wicked outwards... Nothing, you should have a good connection (I think - this may be completely wrong)

If you soldered it onto the cell - you could've damaged the cell with excess heat. Judging by some of your joints - I may make the presumption that you did.


I just know that the last person who I thought in my head was going to start a fire... Did infact set his shit on fire. I don't want to see that happen again. I'd rather tell you your shit is fucked and let somebody who knows better prove me wrong than have anybody risk a fire.

Answer to your original question:

If you take more time to read this forum you would know it. 

Cells don‚Äôt like heat and damage them. So soldering will damage those cells for sure. Also know our packs have to deal with much vibration. Due that solder points can easy break. + just spotweld everything don‚Äôt use solder to connect nickel to each other or to the cells. 

I see Li ion cells almost each day same for my solder iron.  I am not going to say that my soldering work is perfect.  But it comes very close.  Please take a look on my instagram. Then you will know how a pack must look

2. insulate all conection points with fish paper
clean up the solder joints 
3. use kapton tape
4. hot glue all the cells together
5. general clean up

If it were my battery I was keeping in my family's home (in the theoretical situation in which I have parents who aren't cunts) that I care about, I would completely scrap the soldered cells and get new ones, look at some more of the great battery pictures you can find on this forum, and completely fuckin copy them. 

Honestly - I'm using a compression pack for my first, and most likely second build. I don't fly often... But when I do, I want to have a board. I also love modularity. 

If you want to spot-weld though, keep at it and wait until you have a working rig. Money and budgets suck ass, I don't eat at restaurants because it causes me physical pain and mental anguish that I could eat better for 10% of the price at home. Yadda yadda.

You don't need to throw it away. The cells that have just been spot welded can definitely be saved.

Don't also let this completely put a fork in your project. Over-insulate the bad parts for the time being, charge the battery on something safe (on ceramic w/ventilation nearby or even outside) where you can be with it as it charges, take it for some rides and check how things are going. If you're vigilant about it, you shouldn't have too many issues. Just don't not be vigilant while it's in that condition.

I don't think you need to toss the pack. But try to imagine your battery is being tumbled around in a paint can shaker, and anticipate what will break, what will wear through insulation, and what happens when it happens at each particular location. Will it cause the board to stop running? Will it cause a spark and burnt wires? Will something that can carry big current short and start a fire?

Under constant vibration, if metal is bending it'll work harden and eventually break. Solder joints may pop loose. Weak spot welds may pop loose. They may pop partially loose and cause a lot of heat. etc etc etc.

In your pack with some cells spot welded and some cells direct soldered, you'll have different performance from those cells, so you'll have to be more vigilant, and not have blind faith in your BMS.

It seems many do not get it.

There is no perfect way to build an esk8 pack. We have very little experience with such an adverse application. Packs fail all the time, even packs that we previously thought were properly made.

All we can do is try and anticipate all forms of failure. So there is no X does not do this and Y does not do that. If there is something you can do to minimize the chances of a pack failing, then you do it.

4A for AWG20 is completely fine. I use 22 AWG for 2A charging. The wires don't even warm up.
24AWG would even work for 4A charging but that is really the limit (I don't recommend that). It‚Äôs better to use 22AWG for 4A but if you want to play it really safe go with 20AWG. 18 or 16 AWG is overkill.

+1 18awg silicone is where the wire starts to feel like they won't break easily.

I like the pomona brand, for test leads. Comes in 50ft lengths. Not much more expensive than generics.

I also like the hobbyking 14awg silicone bonded wire. That's black and red fused together. Helps with the mess.

I have always wondered this as well.  My packs are all completely sealed for water reasons -- the cell itself isn't but the whole pack is.  What is the valve actually for?  Does it vent under normal usage?

I can‚Äôt tell you exactly that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt wrote anything to it. I would assume that under normal conditions nothing happens but when they short the valve protects the cells from exploding. I should take a minute to read about it more in detail. If to look on lipos they usually puff more or less even under normal use. If some same processes happen in 18650s the valve might give the gasses to come out. In this case it would be suboptimal to close it up completely.

I'm curious too, this [NASA pdf](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/therm_runaway_test_18650_li-ion_clobato.pdf) is one of the top search results. Lots of cool pictures and data in there. Looks like you are right, only if the battery overheats the top will [come off to vent the gasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVeNKkQ2HIY). I wonder if too much nickel would prevent that from happening.

@b264 I guess an ideal design would allow such an event to rupture your enclosure and expel the hot gas outside the pack.

You would think if your cells get hot there would be a little off gassing. But I can't find any proof of this. It seems the vent is just for thermal run away. Unless a small amount of gas can just leak around the seals? The vent seems to rupture for one time use case.

I did find this good research paper that has amazing images and analysis of the vent systems of several brands of 18650. 

"_Here, ultra-high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging is used at >20 000 frames_
_per second to characterize the venting processes of six different 18650 cell_
_designs undergoing thermal runaway. For the first time, the mechanisms that_
_lead to the most catastrophic type of cell failure, rupture, and explosion are_
_identified and elucidated in detail._ "

@lazarus @b264 @lrdesigns i didn‚Äôt look it up yet because of... night, sleep etc üòÖ but what came in my head was a yt video about relocating the CID. So I just came across this
https://batterybro.com/blogs/18650-wholesale-battery-reviews/18306003-battery-safety-101-anatomy-ptc-vs-pcb-vs-cid

As i understand there are two safety mechanism in the positive terminal

* CID current interrupt device
* PTC Pressure, Temperatur, Current switch

This protection can be realized by a bi metal plate which open up the circuit if the cell gets too hot. 

So my conclusion on it is, if your battery pack is closed/sealed but the individual terminals are not directly closed it‚Äôs not an issue. If you get epoxy in the holes of the positive terminal it‚Äôs bad. The cell will work under normal conditions, but you block the safety features of the individual cell.

Doesn't look pretty but I don't see any major issues.

What is the white stuff you used to tack it together? Silicone? If you're using a caulking gun, push forward with it and it'll spread it with a nice radius. Alternatively, lay it down and then go over it with something like a popsicle stick. I couldn't live with that ugliness in my life haha. 

As for the soldered solid copper... that's definitely something I haven't seen before. The soldering job looks iffy in some spots just from the pictures, but if you think it flowed underneath well I'd say it'll do pretty well. An idea might be to get some conductive epoxy/glue and fillet it up both sides with a nice spreader. It'll help a little bit with conductivity throughout.

I think it depends on usage, if you plan to push your cells to the point of them getting hot (50c) or you live in a country where summer is friggin hot then I wouldn't use hot glue. Most other cases it should be fine. Silicone is more durable either way its just takes way longer to make a pack that way.

I planned to cover all open connection with fish paper and kapton tape permanently after i am done with the bms. Also, included some plastic strips between the 5s batteries like below

It looks OK, however you should have rounded the edges of the nickel so it can‚Äôt cut the insulation.

The soldering also actually looks like a cold solder joint. You should have used two bits of 14awg wire as it is easier to solder and doesn‚Äôt heat the battery as much. Those joints should be re flowed so they look smooth and shiny, kinda like the balance lead one in the very first pic you posted

With the way he has the balance  cables organized its really hard to keep them from overlapping without a space in between, especially the ones in the middle.

I will sometimes do one side in the middle cover it with fish paper and then do the other.

Looks ok. Do you have any clearer pictures showing the spot welds?

Also I take it the side without the fishpaper under the fold is the negative pole. If yes then you are good. If it is the positive, you may have a problem.

You want the area shown with the red arrows to be covered with fish paper. If the strips ever cut through the shrink wrap you will have a short.

Hello, I am at the stage of building batteria for my project. I would ask for criticism or catching errors that I could make during the design. I will use the Samsung 30t battery. I want to create 10s2p which will give me a total of 70A and 6Ah. I will use a spot welder and nickel 10mm x 0.15 for serial and parallel connections. In addition, the series wants to connect with a 10awg silicone cable or a 6 mm copper (pvc) cable.
I am still waiting for fish paper to reach me to perform the isolation of groups P. On the positive and negative sides will be insulated (in the local store I have access to 18650, will it be ok or better to get bigger?).
I will use BMS bestech 80a.
I would like to put the batteries in printed ABS handles (the pet will be better despite the lower resistance to temperature?)

Didn‚Äôt see that you only used 1 for the other series connections as well. You‚Äôre using 10mm X 0.15mm nickel strip, right? Then use 3 nickel strip for each series connection and you should be good :slight_smile:

This thread helped me a lot, so here's my contribution:

 The battery that I made for my first build (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/build1-torqueboards-v2-trucks-sk3-6364-190kv-10s5p-vesc/25814/12) did NOT hold up despite not being a particularly flexible board. Their was no strain relief on the nickel welds and the nickel started separating from the cells. I took the battery apart completely, and rebuilt it to better handle flex in the board.

Now I'm paranoid about the nickel welds failing, so first I got a proper spot welder. https://www.keenlab.de/index.php/product/kweld-complete-kit/
![IMG_20190424_124059|666x500](upload://AwF1NnSjOKvOIC4dNLyX1RJ8rbM.jpeg)

I ordered a bunch of PCBs from jlcpcb (25 for $16.70). I found the design on @akhlut 's github https://github.com/akhlut/BATT-PCB. Also be sure to check out his wiki- https://github.com/akhlut/BATT-PCB/wiki. I used 1/2 inch copper braid to make the series connections that go along the outside of the pack. https://www.ebay.com/itm/10-FEET-1-2-BRAIDED-GROUND-STRAP-GROUNDING-Tinned-Copper-Flat-Braid-MADE-IN-USA/291855955896?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&amp;_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649 I reused some 3d printed spacers to separate the groups that I glued on with silicone and attached pieces of fish tape to the battery on the connecting cells that did not have the spacers attached to. This works fine, but I probably would use something other than the 3d printed spacers if I were to do this again. The fish tape I used was not adhesive backed, so I used carpet tape as the adhesive.

My soldering iron didn't seem quite up for the task for soldering the nickel braid, so I got this beast. https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07F8NCD8B/ref=twister_B079XZG96R?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1
![IMG_20190507_173004|666x500](upload://zVon8zSwHOXAwrWQtyFOXxiOQ4n.jpeg)

The following pictures don't show it well, but I did cover both the 0V and 52V pcbs with braided nickel as well and fixed the main negative and positive leads to the middle.   

 ![IMG_20190507_190222|375x500](upload://ovviVQTSyn8Ll2hKcDoFCOGNYyl.jpeg)

I used fishpaper to cover any pack separations the the balance leads crossed and sealed the entire battery with clear shrinkwrap with a thin piece of plywood as a backing.

I did fully understand what you placed between the two pack lines. Fishpaper as well? I mean the red marks.
![image|368x500](upload://cECkRY8EFQp4uktY7IYxm0bQgPd.jpeg) 

Also for future if you use this pcbs, the middle light green field where the bearded angel is printed on is a copper field as well. Avoid that the nickel hanging over the positive or negative bar. The blue market is already pretty close. As far as I can see that‚Äôs no issue on your pack but I think good to know. If plus and minus are hanging over and the thin isolation get rub off a bit due to vibration that could cause a short

Thanks - good to know about the copper field in the middle.
Yeah, the pictures don't do as great of a job showing what is going on as I hoped. Between your red arrows, the pack are joined with nickel strips. This picture might help. I took this when I had to re-fold the battery because I originally forgot to connect the ends of the PCBs down the middle for balance leads. 

I welded a single nickel strip to the PCB for the balance leads. I mistakenly added the nickel strip to both joining boards (as shown by your red arrows), when only one was necessary.

Looking pretty good to me. 

Although I would prefer the cells glued be with silicone than hotglue. 

Just keep the balance wires away from the sharp edges of the nickel. Some of the folded up tabs go over the parallel strip and are quite pokey.

Decided tonight to take apart all of the gluing that I did in favor of redoing them stronger and cleaner. The packs (not yet welded P groups) were super flexible with the silicone not making much contact at all before. Thanks for all the tips from the community to help me make these better.

Yep, it was partially hot glued in the center which just popped right off for the most part. The silicone half the time just needed some fingernail/card scraping and rubbing the cell in a towel to clean the last bits off. Overall the ease at which it all came off is a great sign it was a sub par application of both hot glue and silicone.

Really depends on where you will be putting the braided wire. Can you make a diagram or something? If it‚Äôs how I imagine, then yes you should. Add one more layer.

If you had decided to connect each cell to the next cell with nickel, then you wouldn‚Äôt have to :slight_smile: 

You for sure have to add some more layers of nickel on the main positive and negative side since a lot of current will be going through there. Make it a total of 3. Then put your main discharge lead in the middle of the row.

Also, remember to insulate each parallel group from each other with fish paper :slight_smile: 

Hope it made some sense. If not, feel free to ask :slight_smile:

@legend27 in case like in this 12s6p pack on your photo, why do you think there is need for fishpaper between each parallel group? by my logic, most of the cells will be glued on 6 sides (2 sides of cell with left parallel group, 2 sides with right parallel group, 2 sides with cells in same parallel group), and there is no chance that one whole row, which means 11 glued spots, will break during vibrations. especially when there is nickel between series too.

It's not a whole row that needs to fail- only two cells adjacent to each other in different P groups need their wraps to wear a bit to short.

With glue, shur its great but it's not necessarily made to withstand vibrations and abuse depending on the glue you use. Worst case scenario you use hot glue, I can totally see that getting shaken up and at the point where the two cells meet and you press them together with glue, that is not much glue if any (very minute amount) left between those two cells making contact via the body between P groups. That small amount of glue is your safety net now, besides the cells wrap. 

A short between different P groups cell bodies? Take the one instance of that happening and multiply that by the number of touches between cells that are basically touching adjacent P groups, and you get the more realistic scenario of ... 1 in a million short, just divided by however many touches you have in your pack. maybe 1 in 1000. Plenty of people would bet on that, but we have seen plenty of well built packs go up in flames on this forum too, so it's not unheard of. Take your bets.

If either of those points between the adjacent P groups wears, that's a short. Better get some highly abrasive resistant, vibration resistant, strong glue for that. Otherwise, i'd rather trust something basically made for the job like fish/barley paper.

I do understand about thin layer of glue (or silicone, it doesn't matter in this case) and just battery wrap, and that definitively is problematic when battery is made in just one layer, there is shaking and many forces in just this one connection point. but here, in this case, when one parallel group is actually one 'block', and has 11 spots where it is glued to another 'block', I don't see possibility of just 1 of those 11 spots breaking and making short. it should be all 11 spots, or none. and I don't think it is possible that all 11 spots + nickel over them will break.

Hi everyone,\

Now, I want to make it a bit safer and those are the things I thought about:\
1) replace generic BMS with a Bestech one (recommendations are welcomed)
2) properly insulate the balance wires and do some better cable management (so that they don't cross)
3) XT90 connector and fused charge port

Anything I missed?\
I would really need some help with the correct bms. The battery pack is made out of LG 18650HE2 cells which are pretty similar to 30q's.\
Thanks for reading. :slight_smile:

Yes, back when I bought the battery I didn't really do any extensive research and just went for the cheapest battery... Now I know that this was a pretty bad decision, nonetheless I have to deal with it since as a student I can't really afford a new battery...\
 And I would highly doubt that anyone would buy it if I offered it for sale... :slight_smile:

Ok I'm adding another layer of nickel to all p groups, top and bottom.  
  
The only clarification I want to make is that the diagram you made on my pic is pretty darn close to what I'm going for, the only difference is replace the 6 blue lines nickel strip with 4 lines of this kind of flat braided wire:  
![](https://www.maneywire.com/images/products/Tinned%20Copper%20Braid.jpg)  
The braid I got is rated to 40A continuous, so I'm using 4 lines of it and plan to set hard upper limits of 100A draw off the pack.

Hi, I am starting to build my 10S4P with Samsung 30Q with a Bestech 80A BMS.

This is my diagram:
![10s4p|690x401](upload://akdgTLZ08VoUIISEksDGTl8qS9Z.jpeg) 

I have isolated the P groups:
![IMG_4365|666x500](upload://kYoNtm3kmsAxSmn94Hvpb77J0k0.jpeg) 

Prepared the nickel:
![IMG_4366|666x500](upload://eCmmE8oCNbQztjYJ24V3wQ9Hiy9.jpeg) 

And will spot weld the nickel like this:
![IMG_4387|667x500](upload://nQJZ2JUfnlz4XWwLlQ3FQkvkhjZ.jpeg) 

And then weld the Series like this (top and bottom) and was wandering if it is a good idea to weld the balance wire (red on the image) like this:
![IMG_4388|500x500](upload://spgTOyWhTDp44iQrJ6qoYwzZcjO.jpeg)


or just add another nickel and bend it on top of the P group? Don't really like bending nickel because I am afraid it will crack with vibration:

![IMG_4389|375x500](upload://jloYHG0EUCajn3MVTBAElHpEnla.jpeg) 

Thank you.

Hi all. I'm busy making my first 12s4p battery pack from Sammies 30Q. I currently have 2x6s LiPos powering my Trampa Urban Carver. I want to go slick and just bought [an enclosure](https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/trampa-carver/) from @Eboosted.


I'm planning on laying out my pack like this:

![61A72663-0EEA-4746-9C22-A439A9E19522|451x500](upload://kJDjQCkEDcrDF9MY2Oo8V30wsVS.png) 

I currently only have 1 motor and VESC though - I will upgrade to dual motors in a few months. I just want to get rid of the ugly box on the back of my board first. 

The reason for 2 balance ports is that I have a [balance charger](https://www.graupner.com/charger-ULTRAMAT-18Li-Pb-NiHM/6470/) that has 2 x 6s balance ports, which allows me to charge 12s.

I'm therefore not planning on installing a BMS, but rather have the balance ports in the side of the enclosure somewhere. What I _really_ want is to have a **_single_** waterproof plug/connector for my balance cables from the charger, something like a DIN plug or perhaps even a VGA type of connector. I've seen a few options here in the forum but would really appreciate some suggestions. 

My charge cable connects with XT90s and I'm happy to mount that to the side of the enclosure, but would prefer a more elegant solution, such as a laptop-style plug and switch but obviously with anti-spark protection. Suggestions here would also be very welcome.

I've only glued the p groups together so far with silicone and put the insulation rings on the positive terminals. 
![silicone%20glued|690x335](upload://7TSXgHSC4DxsMZd7rIvuQxD0Vfr.jpeg) 

I'm a bit stuck now as I want to do this properly but it's really difficult to get the right material here in South Africa and shipping from anywhere else is generally crazy expensive. So I would rather find out exactly what I need before I make my next order online.

Firstly, I would like to use battery PCBs with cell level fuses, as this seems to be the most failsafe option. I've been checking the forums for pre-built PCBs and so far it's only @Kaly and @thisguyhere that sell these. @Kug3lis also had them at one stage, I think, but I can't find them on his site.  Any recommendations?

If I used PCBs do I still need fishpaper and kapton tape? I'm pretty sure it would be recommended to do so.

I'd also like to know what gauge wire I'd need for

1. the series connection wire (12AWG?)
2. the balance cables (22 AWG?)

One of my main concerns is how to ensure that the flex of the board doesn't break the series connections, or any connections for that matter. 

Then, what is the best material for keeping the pack from shifting? Should I be using foam padding above and below the pack (i.e. between the board and the battery on the top and between the battery and the enclosure on the bottom?) 

I haven't indicated on the diagram the general fuse - I'm planning on simply reusing the one that's already wired in. I'm probably also going to [reuse a lot of the wiring that's already there](http://www.trampaboards.com/complete-beast-box-12s1p-cable-kit-with-key-wire-xt90--xt90s-connectors-50-amp-fuse-all-soldered--heat-sealed-ready-for-plug--play-use-trampa-stamped-silicone-cable-p-24690.html). Good idea?

Happy to hear advice and guidance from all you gurus on this forum.

You need a BMS.  You said you don't want one, but everything else you said means it's your best option.  Ditch the hobby charger and use a BMS and regular brick charger.

Also, You shouldn't use XT90 for loopkey AND charge port.  For either one, it's fine.  But if you have both, then use XT30 or XT60 or 5.5mm x 2.1mm barrel connector for charging. (nod to @Andy87)

Also, always [fuse](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/576-099707.5WXN) your charge port.

I‚Äôm not sure I follow why you came to this conclusion. One of the main reasons I enjoy having the balance charger is that I can see how the individual packs are charging and whether they‚Äôre balanced or not. I guess I could get the same info from a smartBMS too though and it would make my life easier with only one plug into the enclosure.

Hello,

I want to make a 10s4p battery but unfortunately in my country (Argentina) the BMS is not reached to load / download the package correctly. It occurred to me if it is possible to divide the package into two of 5s2p each with a [5-cell BMS](https://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-717305700-placa-proteccion-bms-para-345-baterias-li-ion-18650-100a-_JM) and put it in parallel to turn it into a 10s4p one. Is it possible? Would it work well?

P.D: The load would be carried out by placing two independent ports in the enclosure.

Not sure if I understood your problem fully, but what does your bms have to do with the county you in?

Anyway, if you have a 10S4P you will get 2 5S4P or 2 10s2p out of them depending how you split it but not 2 5S2P

You can make 2 5s packs but you need to make SERIES to make 10s. If you connect them in parallel they remain 5s.
Not a good idea if you don't really know what you are doing. A good 10s bms is the no brainer choice. I do not understand your bms problem. Can you elaborate?

My problem is that in my country you can not get a good BMS for those that support 80A minimum.
But if I get two BMS for 5s that support 100A each. So my idea is to make two packs of 5s4p know them in series and achieve one of 10s4p.
But my question is if there will be any inconvenience having two BMS in series?

I haven't seen anyone build with these spacers. Why's that? Besides the stiffness and additional space, what are the drawbacks?
Benefits seem clear to me: providing stability and strength to reduce chances of damage. 

Can I just tack weld them up as is and shrink wrap them together or do I need to do anymore insulating (fishpaper rings on POS is a given)

As they make the pack more bulky and limit the the nickel to 7mm they not the best choice for flat packs. If you have the space and use H-form nickel you bend over the edges after it's a good way to do a pack as well. Why not.

This will be my first pack so i am a bit unsure about som of the practical things surrounding this. My plan is to build 3 identical 4s2p packs <100wh using VTC6 cells. These will be connected in series to make a 12s2p pack. I see that the norm is to wrap the entire P group with fish paper, hoewer since I only will have a 2P pack I was wondering if the configuration shown in the picture is sufficient? With this configuration I can glue all 8 cells together using heat resistant silicone and I assume this is important considering all the vibrations, but I am also unsure if this is sufficient isolation between the P groups. I have zero experience so any tips is welcome also a completely different configuration.

Use silicone wire. You want some flexibility between blocks to deal with the torsion. The thicker the wire the better but ratings do not really work in this case. All charts are based on long lengths. You will use around 3 cm of wire. Not enough to heat til the point that it builds more resistance. With 10awg you have more than you need. Insulate with kapton or barley the nickel strips between blocks so they do not touch each other. You want the power transfer in series be done from the parallel point not from the cells. So they will not disbalance that much and the nickel will remain cool. The holders are a great choice. I use them everytime i can. They provide better integrity than silicone and let the cells breathe so they perform like radiators. In a 2p pack overheat is a huge problem. You will pretty much avoid it using holders.
One last thing. Make sure the balance wires are put together away from the nickel. A strip of eva foam under them will protect any scratch. Tie them with tape

Two questions:

1) Do I need to add an additional strip of nickel across the busses for added connectivity? I'm concerned that the bus of the PCB might not be able to hold the current needed for the serial connection. I'll be connecting my serial 12awg wire between the 2nd and 3rd cell, as shown in the pic.

![image|243x500](upload://w4iO7McqNGjSBcV7Igymcoqe98T.jpeg) 

2) Is this the correct way to connect a switch?

Another trick about soldering! Use tabbing wires to solder your batteries. Wires look terrible and will damage your battery cap isolations due to constant vibration/friction. Wires take long to tin or even heat up, obliging you to heat up your cells too much and end up with an ugly battery pack. Tabbing wires are flat, just like nickel strips (They are a little lighter so it's recommended to double if you want some crazy amp draw). Tabbing wires are tinned already! You will just tin your cells, place it and apply your iron (the hotter your soldering iron get, the neater you joints will be). TIME TO DITCH WIRES!

@BATTERY 
So you were trying to solder while the balance wires were plugged into the bms? If so no bueno... If not... You did all your soldering and then plugged everything in and it got hot? Probably soldered the wires backwards from 1-12 ...since your pack isnt labeled I cant tell which is group 1 vs 12 but I assume bottom right is 1... 

Also I only count 12 wires total not 13... If so that would mean the very first wire would go to group 1 positive not group 1 negative... 

Which is also why I kept asking myself why your last balance wire isnt on the main positive of your pack... (Assumed as bottom left of pick)

You dig?

@accrobrandon  is absolutely right! if your D140 bms has no first balance wire (which goes on battery main negative) - like in your case @BATTERY, you start with first balance wire on your connector between 1st and 2nd group. if you do it right, your last balance wire will be on battery main positive (after last group).

No, you didn't do it right. usually bms has one more balance wire than groups in series. for 12S battery, that would be 13 balance wires. 

In your case, you have 12 balance wires, which means there is no first wire which goes on battery negative. your first balance wire will go between 1st and 2nd group and there won't be any balance wire on battery main negative. last wire on your balance connector will go on battery positive, after last group of cells. 

you will have to unplug wires from connector or desolder them from groups and solder them right.

EDIT: I am wrong! your balance wires are soldered in wrong order, your 12th wire is actually 1st, and vice versa

and another possible problem that I see. your wires for series connections are soldered on small nickel tabs. there is no point in such thick wires, when nickel tab is bottleneck. all current from your battery will be divided between two nickel tabs, which in no possible way could carry 80amps. I would seriously consider redoing that.

So the nickel in use is rated for 40A, I think this is somewhat debatable. I‚Äôm building with battery PCB‚Äôs, going one layer of nickel on P groups, individual strips from cell to PCB and an additional strip on the top, as for series: 2x braids in 15mm. What do you think? Should I up the nickel? Is this moderately good enough?

Building a 10s4p to go inside of a Haya.![20190830_142433|375x500](upload://o1LPoxP2CPOE9AiCwJ6p6CwvTMv.jpeg) ![20190831_145008|375x500](upload://mxjE4DcS6ngViGPEZHgzCBZxnkj.jpeg) ![20190831_145002|375x500](upload://pn8346nXu7erFoTomheaRFCdOXN.jpeg) ![20190831_145017|375x500](upload://t78bWKXuh5CWVzXwGNfwRCtYo3m.jpeg)

Both will serve the same purpose.  I‚Äôve used both and adhesive is just easier to work with but prior to getting my hands on it I was doing your method. 

Wrapped no adhesive

I've read this thread over, trying to make sure I read everything I can before I actually build my first pack, I dont want my house to burn down while charging. I dont plan on this being a powerhouse by any means, can I just use 12g awg for the series connections? Or will that not be sufficient.

Hey Tinp,
I tried to pm you but i could not find a way to do so, probably because I am new in this forum.(cant figure out to open a new topic either)
I am looking for someone to build me a 12s 4p battery pack for my torque direct drive board with unity controller. and possible a case. I saw you do such things! would you be up for it?
I live in London and most packs seem to be in the US or china, which also makes shipping difficult.
mail me if you like at picfwd@pm.me

Thanks

Sebastian

How are these welds? It's pretty difficult with the sunkko 709a, but on my practice cell with the same settings I could not remove the nickle unless I used alot of force with pliers. ![20190904_142350|375x500](upload://hhFtPO6v22h0dOSwDqKLuUoDS7A.jpeg) ![20190904_142334|375x500](upload://4zPAp1wNduyNlQbVSu6KpQQV80r.jpeg) I know some of these welds are not the best, that's why I'm referring to this thread.![20190904_142317|375x500](upload://eQVjeGrtezeg1Bltcbsjnuyda1b.jpeg)here's the practice cell![20190904_135603|375x500](upload://8swd13Rxw29XbQ1SoF7Nv1gRn8Z.jpeg)

Cell 3 (1,2,3,4) of photo one looks great, that would make for a strong pack

E: actually a stronger weld than the one I mentioned would be much better, maybe tweak your settings

Hello,

I‚Äôm building my very first battery pack using the winfly hardware compression modules. Would like to make sure that I have everything done correctly.

I am making each p-group like this: 

Top holder > shield with insulation ring > cells > shield > bottom holder

![image|401x499](upload://dX2fFdjaRiqsA0BxlfSNPo6TZgW.jpeg)

Here is the first p-group finished, seems to be fine as my multimeter measured 4.17V.

![image|690x481](upload://sKpM7QVmWc5519EGOf7d11ghPAe.jpeg) 

I plan on adding xt30 connectors to each p group to make them somewhat modular (idea from this forum). Should I add fish paper between each p-group? Is there anywhere else I should add fish paper?

Thanks in advance.
```

So far so good? I know they aren't pretty but will they do the trick? This 709a is a pain. This is going in a stiff board so I'm not worried about flex, if necessary I will remove nickle and redo the welds, I've had to remove nickle from some of the cells multiple times and I'm worried about damaging them, especially having to use a dremal to remove bits of nickle leftovers. ![20190905_131109|375x500](upload://iWDSVhNtKxUeEF5ZpspKQzlySbv.jpeg) ![20190905_131016|375x500](upload://9bUMx1rYu3FflOb8lmVkgDqf8qx.jpeg)also, I kept the settings the same for all the welds, just to put into perspective how inconsistent the 709a is. Another thing, the copper rods are crooked on my 709a, they always have been, the left rod seems to heat up more which is why the welds on the left burned more than the welds on the right of the cells.![20190905_131705|375x500](upload://g4n55lykZFR2ScmmCC9jJmQFlP7.jpeg)

On your diagram it says 20700 40T but the 40T is a 21700 cell, was this a mistake?
