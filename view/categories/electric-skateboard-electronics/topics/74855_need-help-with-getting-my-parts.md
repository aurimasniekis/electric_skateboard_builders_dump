Hello builders, I'm "new" to E-Boards. I mean there isn't much to understand once you know electronics well enough, but I'm no pro when it comes to Electronic Systems, so I wanted to ask for help and recommendations. Note: The board will have 6 wheels, yeah 6. It will have a Tandem Axle setup in the nose. Pic:![image|666x500](upload://mgb85Rtf0RbT1J8htxCQHdlwAwp.jpeg) 
These are my following 'Specs':
- 42" DIY Deck (3 x 3/16" Plywood W/ Fiberglass and Resin in between Layers)
- Caliber II RKP Trucks, Front, and Rear
- Cal 97mm Wheels, 6x
- Flipsky Dual FSEC 4.20, 100A
- 2x Hobbysky 6374 190KV BLDC
- DIY, 12S2-4P Li-Po Battery Pack using 10000Mah Cells from Alibaba (many to choose from, but they are ALL dirt cheap)
- Tx/Rx, just a cheap one
- Gearing ~2.5-3.5:1 Ratio
- BMS 12S 30A(?) 48V
So the only real part I need help with is the BMS, at least for now. I understand how to wire up the BMS to the cells (not hard), but what I can't seem to understand is the Amp rating for the BMS. The eBay seller I will buy the BMS from sells multiple variants, ranging from 30-60A. Is the Amp rating the max the system can take before its toast? Idk, kinda lost, so I decided to ask you pros. I think it has to do with the C rating of the entire Battery Pack than I will need to get the BMS according to the Battery Specs...?

Thank you guys, 

Regards, 

Joseph, a noob builder :grinning:

So let's say you have a 60a bms. If you pull more than 60a your bms will cut the power because it's designed to deliver 60a and not more than that. You'd be better off with a 80a bms because if you overbuild then you can ride knowing you're not pushing your system. Most of us run 60a bms's.
You can also bypass a low amp bms and use it for charging only.

If u are doing dual setup you should take a look into the dual flipsky vesc 6. Iâ€™ve heard pretty good things about it. Also you will want a 12s4p if running dual drive. If u are using bms for discharge as well spend the extra money on a 12s bestech bms so u get a high discharge amperage rating. If ur doing charge only get whatever amperage u want for discharge because u wonâ€™t be discharging for it. I have used theb12s bestech d140 for charge only and it works fine.
Good luck

Also buy real cells like Samsung 30q or 25r. I would trust Chinese cells because they are so cheap, itâ€™s probaly too good to be true

WOW, response in just 2 mins. Thank you! Yeah, I'll go with 12S4P. And, ill spend an extra buck on a high discharge BMS, probably. Also, about the 18650 cells. To build what i want, and the budget I got, it would be over ~$200 for just a battery (good cells cost ~$5-8/Ea). I cant afford that. So I will probably just buy 4 x 3S Li-Po's and dissect them to fit my requirements.

This guy used those cells in a pretty average build but it might be helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q0m8n-b8cY&t=31s


Also if you are running 12s then don't use the 4.20 vesc.  Go for a 6 or a focbox.

Also don't go cheap on the bms.  Use a decent one or you will have drama.  Go for a bestech with a minimum of 80 amps or a low amp wired for charge only.

Well, yes, but he is only running 6S. Mine would be 12S4P, so range and overall power output would more than double,in theory. Well and, it would be ~$160 for 16 of these, and needing all the other parts, that is sadly MAYBE just too much for my budget, but we'll see.

Theres a big sale coming up too.  You can not go better than a focbox unless you can afford a proper vesc6.  I use them on all my builds and they are rock solid on 12s.

Yeah i would be a bit careful with a standard 4.12 vesc.  If you are going to run them then you definitely need to heatsink the shit out of them.  My tb and hk vescs got extremely hot running 12s.

If you are going to run foc with all the bells and whistles ie traction control or a bluetooth module then you need a canbus connector.  If you want simple bldc then a split ppm cable for the receiver will do.

this vid goes through the wiring and set up for both  

@dg798  do you run them constantly on 12s or was it just for a while.  Do you have a 12s set up running tb vescs?

For me the heat was an issue.  Bearing in mind I do live in Australia where an average winter is still 26'c so that may have played a part but I also don't like how close you come to the erpm limit on 4.12 either.  It just makes things much easier for a noob to pop something with incorrect kv etc.  
Hey don't go blaming me if I have put the kiss of death on your set up and something blows lol

About the BMS. I'll be running 12S4P. Every cell (16) needs to be hooked up to the BMS if I'm using it for charging. So if i run the BMS bypassed when not charging, it does not really matter how high the Amp rating is, right?

@JosephShubin
If you're not discharging through it then the amp rating can be low.  Nice little tiny one.  The bestech 80 amp is a beast of a thing.  If I was using a charge only I could have got another 10 cells in my evo.

Update: So after some more research and thought, I have further refined and zeroed in on how I want my E-Board to look like and perform. Here is my updated parts list and explanations:

Note: The board will be built around my weight, height, budget, and personal preference. I'll take any constructive criticism happily.

I weigh ~145-150Ibs (66-68Kgs), 5'11" tall, male, currently 17.

Mechanical, non Electric:
- Deck will be made of 3 x 3/16" Plywood w/ Fiberglass tape in-between layers. Bonded with Bondo Fiberglass Resin. The deck will be 10" wide and 42" long. I want stability.
- The Trucks will be 2 x Caliber II (44 Deg.) and will be drop through. Nothing special. They got good reviews, are very common, and very cheap. They're 10" wide axles, so overall width w/ wheels will be over 1'. This will also increase stability.
- Wheels will be 4 x Cal 97mm wheels. They're cheap, got good reviews, and large. I want higher speeds than acceleration. 
- The pulley setup is a bit iffy. I will go for a ratio of ~2-3. I don't got any hills to go over around me, at least significant, so I'll prefer speed. The motor gear, or input will be a 20T, 10mm bore. I can't seem to find any reasonable priced and 'good' quality gear for the motors. They are expensive (~$100 for two sets) and that would be ~40-42T. Recommendations? 10mm belt(s).

Electrical:
- I'll be running a dual drive system. The motors a will be 2 x 6374's. I was going to go with "Hobbysky" motors, but they are $80/Ea. Too much. I know going with unbranded Chinese motors is iffy, but spending ~$180 is too much.
- I'll go with two Focbox systems. They seem to be popular and good. Not to cheap, but reasonable. 
- A cheap, ~$30 Tx/Rx. Nothing special.
- I've updated my battery system as well. I want to go with Zop 5200mah 50C 3S Li-Po's. They get good reviews on eBay and Bangood. I'll buy them from eBay. The seller is selling 4 of them for only $100! That's awesome! I will be running 12S4P, so 11.1V (3S) x 4 cells = 44V. Than i'll add 3-4 more in Parallel to increase capacity. 
- I'll bypass BMS, but will charge w/ BMS.
- The charger will be a Power Supply rated for 60V @ 5A.

So, that's about it for now. Any corrections, recommendations, etc are welcome. Here is the parts list with links on Google Sheets. Total price right now is around ~$800.
