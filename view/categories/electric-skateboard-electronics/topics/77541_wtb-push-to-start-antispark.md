Hi,

I am looking for a push to start antispark. I have the flipsky in my build but the flipsky don't want to turn on when there are focbox's connected. So each time I want to turn them on I must to disconnect the focbox's. I want a small antispark. Something like the antispark from @Martinsp 

It is a very small fit inside the ensclosure

I have two of the push to start switches from @Martinsp new and never used.
Thought i‘ll need them but plans changed and i‘ll go with a top mount enclosure and loop key.
If you want one you can have it for the original price. Shipping is to Belgium right? Than shipping would be on my costs.

technically I was fast enough because you asked for one he offered two and then I asked for the second one before you.

That said, im cool ill wait for Martin as I don't need it for a couple of weeks anyway so knock yourself out.

I found an anti-spark from @Martinsp  in my stuff yesterday. He worked perfectly yesterday. He died this evening after a small test ride :confused:

At this point I'm pretty convinced any antispark that doesn't precharge the gate is a temporary switch at best.
