After building countless boards here and having to fix and modify a good amount of vesc`s I have come to the conclusion that alot of people must have repairable vesc`s laying around and dont have the means or are willing to fix them. Anyone who`s fried or killed their vesc and wants to make some $$$ off the broken thing can tell me what they did to it and send a picture and I`ll pay up to 30$ plus shipping for it.
