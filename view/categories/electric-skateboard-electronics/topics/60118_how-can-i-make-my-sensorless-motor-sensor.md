Hi. I say how some people turned there sensorless motors into sensore. Can someone please help me to do the same. I'm building an electric mountainboard and I want to be able to take off from 0mph.

You will be able to take of at 0 speed without sensors, without a problem. If you got powerful motors and dual drive you will feel very little difference. You will however feel a big difference when taking of from a standstill on a hill. 
You could add hall effect sensors to the motor or an encoder but the work needed for doing so is not worth it imo. I would just buy another pair of motors if the sensors are a big concern.

Thankyou. My mine is now set on getting alien power sensors. Do you know weather it's going to be easy or hard to install?
