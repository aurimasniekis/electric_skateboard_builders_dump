It looks like there are holes in order to solder the connectors if we look closely, right?
And what's the price of this vesc?

Possibly, but not so immediately and shipping and duties could be an issue?

Indeed, delay might be an issue...
I thought that enertion were offering free shipping as well, wrong?

If it was up to me, I would totally chose to buy it from enertion:
- great discount these days (30$ cheaper than this uk one
- known good quality
- delay is the only drawback I can think of if you are in a hurry
