Hey guys,

I wanna attach some kind of enclosure to my board, without making holes in the deck. I also wanna be able to switch out the enclosure for a maybe smaller one.

Whats the best way to go about that .. Hot glue? 

Cheers!

Maybe you could try Velcro straps like you find on some types of sandals.  It's not exactly pretty, but it's probably the best way to avoid permanently altering your board with holes or glue.

Due to the vibration, you will need a fixed mounting system. Screws, bolts, strong magnets.

For me, the velcro straps couldnt hold the components when riding on course asphalt. Too much vibration.

Hey thanks for the answers! Velcro straps also dont look so good cause they go all around the deck ..

@feliler So what did you end up doing?

Screws. tnuts,nuts and bolts, or wood screws are the only way to attach your enclosure securely. There are already at least 8 holes in your deck. Didn't hurt it at all to drill those holes right?

haha i know its the most common and obviously best way to do it, but i made this post to maybe find a viable alternative :)

Let us all know if you find one. The whole industry will be interested. :joy:

Unfortunately, there isn't another way. You can use threaded inserts in the board if you want a good looking setup.

You may want to look into super strong neodymium magnets. I don't think many people have used them but there's been discussion about them in the past.

I tried it, but it didn't work because ultimately the magnets are only as strong as the glue holding them and glue fails with road vibration.

If you could somehow put the magnets between the laminates in the deck and form them into your enclosure it would be a different story.

how about putting the magnets in the deck and then a layer of Fiberglass on the bottom of the deck. Then add the magnets inside the enclosure with epoxy?

With proper planning though, Installing all of your program ports and charge leads to the enclosure, you never need to remove your enclosure anyway.

I use tape for now lol. But i think a good solution can be to fasten T-nuts to the deck.

Couldn't you just use flathead skateboard hardware? Or is it not strong enough (for bigger batteries / builds)?

If you have a bunch of tool like a anvil, drill-press, stick welder, angle grinder, taps/dies and a bar steel bender. Then you could build some claps that hug the edges of the deck. I've made motorcycle seat brackets, and other parts this way. Its going to end up looking a little over built, and heavy. Alternatively if you have a 3d printer it possible to designee some clamps. Anyway you cut it your end up with a lot of waste trying to avoid the simple solution. I use Rat nuts. I would avoid wood screws because they can end up giving your board long micro cracks, and it can killing the pop. Rat nuts and thread inserts tend to fill the space which is really the best solution. less stress on the wooden deck, and a nice clean looking install.

I think if you mount a base with flanges for glue to the deck with sikaflex, then screw the enclosure into that base piece, you could make the enclosure without drilling into the deck.

I've velcroed all the components to the board and it works as long as the battery isn't to thick and heavy. Not straps just Velcro. Stuff from hobbyking is strong.

I've also glued using hard polyurethane and was even stronger (for batteries). And a thin carbon layer wet laid on top

Here's an idea. This idea would need the enclosure to be relatively thin, and the enclosure material would need to be as wide as the deck.

Velcro can be one of the cleanest solutions I have seen on here. Better than some of the screwed enclosures even.

How so? He had to use twice the amount of screws into the deck for the velcro anchors...The are way cleaner solutions..<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/2/02ec3d241cef5797aed2c487ec1f7ab64c1ec24f.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/d/3d38873985c6fd43d4dd8535a8de4b05d7addbc8.jpg" width="282" height="500">

You could have this. But you're going to use velcro?

I have to admit that I was assuming that he just does not want to have through holes and that wood screws would be ok.
He could however try and epoxy them or something - that could also work. Just not sure if that would actually be any "cleaner" than through holes :thinking: 
I guess the question is why does he not want to drill holes in the deck?

Look at the pictures I just added here. No through holes. There are carbon steel threaded inserts that I installed into the deck. The enclosure is screwed into those.  Most people assume drilling holes will weaken their deck. Even though nobody has a deck that doesn't have holes drilled in it already.

Yeah I was doing the same with my enclosure - threaded inserts are nice.
I just assume that he does not have the right tools for it (drill press so you can stop and don't drill all the way through) - also this only works when the deck thickness allows this.
You could also close the hole on the top again with epoxy @whitepony style.

Using the velcro anchors however was really simple as you can just use basically any wood screw and only need a cordless drill or screw driver. When removing them the "hole" that is left is pretty small and inconspicuous
