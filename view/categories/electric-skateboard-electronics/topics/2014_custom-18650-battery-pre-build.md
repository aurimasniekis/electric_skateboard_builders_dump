Is there anything I am missing? I am not going to need an on/off switch because I am using the FVT esc and it has a built in switch…. right? Have any of you used either of the status indicators? How do you use it on the BMS I linked? Any improvements? Your help is always appreciated!

Thanks,
JLabs

@JLabs nice work! I haven't built one of these myself, but it seems like the trend everyone follows it to include a power switch on the battery pack and not rely on the ESC's power switch. I've been looking into building my own pack and I planned to use a power switch. The reasoning is that you want a physical way to open the circuit.

please do!

I'm in for some Samsung 25r's or LG he2/he4's if someone can organize something like a couple hundred or more (cells) group buy. 

@longhairedboy maybe you wanna build some custom 18650 packs since you are already pretty good at distributing and repairing batteries :wink:  

@barajabali or whoever decides to arrange the group buy, please make a new thread topic as to not hijack this one- thanks!

Dude Bros.......Generally the more cells in parallel to discharge the longer the pack life and the further the ride. While these Samsung 25R can handle alot, more cells to distribute the load is mas better...add ten more cells and get 50% more range and reduce the beating each cell takes ....or better yet up it to 4p or 5p and recharge once or twice a week!!! I'm sure you all have studied this stuff but just adding my $0.02

it just so happens that i have a custom build request coming my way and i'm going to need to build a pack. 

Depending on the mAh per cell, i may want as many as 60 if enough people get in on it. Otherwise i'll probably only get 30. plus a couple of extras in case there are duds. 

Where do we buy from?

If my math is right (I'm still learning) your battery would be 180Wh? And weigh approx 840g (1.8lbs)
That's pretty enticing!
This just about what I'm looking for thanks for the work and links

As far as power switches, you can either use the one on the BMS if it has a soft switch (if you're using a BMS at all) or buy a soft switch similar to what @torqueboards is selling. Or use his, i've been pretty happy with the one i got from him a couple years ago.  there's also an open source one somewhere on the web that i can't find right now that's basically the same thing, a couple of FETs on a tiny PCB with a low current push button switch attached to it. 

The volt meter / fuel gauge can just be wired into the mains after the switch and before the ECSs. On my 6S rat board i have the volt meter soldered into the leads on the switch. ITs as good a place as any. If you put it between the pack and the switch you're going to end up with a volt meter that's just always on.

I just got the Vedder's SparkSwitch made but made some changes to handle more amperage due to the issues a few people have been having with it.

- Added wider traces to the PCB.
- Included 40amp fuse jumpers. Will be XT90 10awg ends (overkill though).
- It will have the same push button switch as before. Blue LED. I've added a 3 pin to make it easier to connect. In the future, I will probably switch this out with a connector which doesn't come undone.
- This will replace the switch which I currently have..

How do you calculate it? I was curious becasue they are 2500mAh cells and there is now way its 50,000mAh I am going to plan on making it 10s3p in stead of 2p
```

---
## \#23 Posted by: barajabali Posted at: 2016-03-28T22:58:18.829Z Reads: 310

```
okay so if battery "A" is 3.7 volts @ 2500mah  And battery "B" is the same

When you combine them both in parallel meaning + with + and  - with -  then then the mah jumps to 5000. and voltage stays at 3.7 volts. 

SO since this is a 2p pack the mah is 5000.

a 3p pack would be 7500 mah. 

If you combine 10 of those 3p packs together in series youll get 3.7volts  * 10 packs and you get 37 volts.  

Sorry i dont mean to insult you im sure you know most of this stuff already just wanted to walk thru it all in case someone else read this

You only have two batteries in parallel and at 20 amp continuous each that will be 40amp continuous. I would go to 3p so you can have 60amp continuous. Up hills and at high speeds you can easily get past 40 amps.

mAh are added in parallel, but voltage is added in series. 

if you have a 10S3p using 2500mah cells, what you have is a 36V 7500mah pack. 

Essentially a space cell.

I just ordered Samsung 25R cells from here, they had the lowest prices I could find, free shipping, and people say their cells are authentic (both on vaping forums and the product's review page.
They also have LG HE4 cells for similarly cheap prices (they're out of stock for the flash sale, but their normal price is only $1 higher for the 4 pack). I chose the Samsung for their slightly higher continuous discharge rate since I'll be running a 3p battery.

Wow. I was able to order 4 packs of the Samsung 25R's like 10 minutes ago. I bought 24 cells for an 8s3p pack. It came out to $83 shipped.

Also, the out of stock is just for the flash sale. They'll be in stock (when it says the flash sale ends) for about a dollar more for each 4 pack.
I think it'll be $15 for the HE4 and $17 for the 25R 4packs, and then you can use the 10% off coupon in my post above.

Why dost thou decide to go for a rear mount?

The only reason is that I had this set of Surfrodz/LaGrange L1 Trucks. I figured I may as well use them though right? Matt made me a flat 8s lipo pack with bms and smart charger too for this build. 65c 8s and an EZrun Max 6 ESC.

hey guys, how is the battery pack work going?

I'm wondering about the following: 
- use nickel strips to connect the 18650 cells? (they might only hold up to 40A, so this might be ok to connect the P cells)
- wire gauge to use which connects the p3 cells and everything else? (AWG10 rated for 52A) 

I'm just wondering since I'm trying to do the same thing, 10S3P bought the same BMS 37V 60A (at least it's ordered) and the LG HE4 cells, but I now doubt the whole idea to support a 60 amp continuous current, even though this is only theoretical. 

If I put in a 60A BMS I would like to ensure that the batterypack is actually able to deliver and I really don't know what to use to connect the cells (likely going for something 10mm2 / AWG 8 or 7). Just thinking it doesn't make sense to have a 60A BMS when the connections of your cells start melting before the BMS actually protects your battery pack. Could be that I got something totally wrong though. How are you guys going to connect the cells?

As far as rumors go the enertion space cell, can deliver 40A continuous by BMS (http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/space-cell-opened-up/510) and the batterypack on torqueboards supports just 30A continuous either (electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-10s3p/)

So guess the 60A BMS was actually not the best idea. 

Btw. this is my first post, great place to hang out here thanks to all of you guys, even though I might spend a bit too much time here lately ;) 

Have a good one and happy building!

Hey guys! Here's a quick way to test your nickel strips to make sure they are not steel with nickel plate

@shred

For what it's worth, I'm going to try [DIY's 12S3P w/ 80A Fuse ](product/electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-12s3p/) and the [SPACE Cell PRO4 w/ 40A Fuse](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/space-cell-pro4-electric-skateboard-battery/)

All signs point to using the 12S3P for Carvons.

If I really want to use the space cell and the 40A limit is a problem, here's an example of someone bypassing that with the old space cell

Wish I knew how to build my own pack.  I've been watching this thread to see how it goes.

@TheWrongHombre 

12S will give you more power by the same amps. 

I decided to build a 10S3P, I've a single 190kv / 2200 Watt motor. 10S == 37Volts. 2200Watts / 37Volts = around 60 amps. So that means if I would get 2200 Watts out of my motor (which is the max the motor can do) I will have current of 60 amps going. 

That's the reason why I thought I buy this 60A BMS. But now I figured that it might be hard to make the connectors between all the cells support 60A continuous and I guess that is as well what manufacturing will say, which might as well be the reason why they only support around 30 to 45 amps continuous. (just a guess)

If I would have a 12S you would have higher Voltage, meaning you will get more power/watts by the same current. 

Like, if I would have 12S to support the max 2200Watts of my motor (12S = 44,4Vols, 2200Watts / 44Volts = 50 amps), I would only have to deal with 50 amps instead of the 60A I have to deal with now.

To get the theoretical stuff done now, if you have two motors with 2250 Watts makes a total of 4500 Watts the max amps these two motors would draw while providing 2250Watts each would be around 120 amps if you have a 10S (37V).

But I actually really don't have a clue how many watts you really need while riding, I don't have a electric skateboard yet :)

I've been reading a bit and some people say you only need a few amps for normal riding. Where you need more is for uphill and for accelerating. Otherwise you shouldn't need much actually.

Sorry that's all theoretical stuff. A 12S3P or even a 10S should be enough to have lots of fun riding even with the given limitations..... I guess :slight_smile:

The BMS you suggested cuts the power at 3,0 V, but the cells you have go down till 2,5 V. Don't you waste a lot of energy then?

It's not wasting energy. The cells will probably last longer for the compromise of less range.
