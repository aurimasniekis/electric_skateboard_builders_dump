So I currently use a really cheap multimeter which mostly gets the job done. It did cost me a night‚Äôs sleep a couple weeks back where it started giving unusually high voltage readings while I built my battery pack.  That proved to be because I hadn‚Äôt changed the batteries.

Nonetheless - I use it quite often and I‚Äôd like to get something a little more ‚Äúpro-grade‚Äù. Then I looked at the price of Fluke multimeters and realised I probably want something ‚Äúsemi-pro‚Äù üòÇ

What are you guys using? And recommendations?

And also, does anybody use bench top power supplies? The ones you can dial in voltage and current, and some I think switch between ac and dc? I used one all the time when I did electronics and physics at high school. I‚Äôve often thought one would come in handy when tinkering with various electrical projects.

This sort of thing:

I have a Fluke multi-meter, but it stays on my bench.  This is the one I carry around.

This is the lab power supply I use.  As long as you make sure your charge ports are the same accross all of your boards you can charge multiple voltage levels with one charger/

On top of @mmaner recommendation, get the super fine test leads if you have the budget.

It will help wit troubleshooting the pcb board if you need to.

I have the [UNI-T](https://www.banggood.com/cs/UNI-T-UT61E-Auto-Range-Modern-Digital-Multimeters-AC-DC-Meter-p-90124.html?cur_warehouse=CN) multimeter and I'm happy with it. I have done some research before buying and this one is supposed to be a good value for the money. The 22000 resolution is really nice and not a common feature in this price range.
