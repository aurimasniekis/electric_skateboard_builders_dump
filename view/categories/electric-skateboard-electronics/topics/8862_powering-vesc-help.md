A battery? I wouldn't use anything else, except if you have a power supply. You can power it with a 3S quadcopter battery or something if you have one...

i think you only need a regulated power supply if there is no firmware on the vesc..which if you got it from any of the relatively well know retailers on the forum im sure that has already been done. i got mine from diyelectricskateboards and was fine just plugging into my batteries

Yeah, you don't technically need a lab power supply - better but you don't need it.

If you had to use a power supply what voltage/current  input would you use?
