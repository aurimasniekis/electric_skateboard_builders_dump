So I want to try and fit my parallel charger on to my board, I was wondering if this was possible if I did it the way I show in the picture. The charger only weighs 119gram and it would be nice if I could leave the battery's plugged in so I only have to plug the parallel charger into the balance charger. Is this possible?![IMG_5562|500x500](upload://3Q3Z23u8qTDq25dKteqEznKDyDa.JPG)

You cant have it plugged into parallel for charging and series at the same time. That will cause a fire. Bad news. 
There are ways to to it, but you have to get creative. I built mine in a similar way to this:

I used a vga cable for the balance wires.

Which I think cleaned up the look but gave me the ability to use a balance charger.

So if I use it like this and I just unplug the battery's when I'm going to charge it will work?![IMG_5563|500x500](upload://6whTwTSBJweXw0G6AEeNuu0oZ4x.JPG)

Yes I did the same for a long time just printed a case with three XT-90 sticking out the side, middle one was for loop key to connect two batteries in series, left and right ones used for charging once series connections between them is broken

Can see my old setup here https://photos.app.goo.gl/5RPu5MDJmnv6hWxcA basically the loop key (middle port) is just on the red black connection between the two batteries.  New setup here https://photos.app.goo.gl/KzDYcYYeHPuD4u5e2
