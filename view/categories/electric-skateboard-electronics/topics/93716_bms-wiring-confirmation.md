This is my second battery build, first one with a charge only BMS. I've got the concept down and the balance wires are correct, but I'm looking for some confirmation on my diagram (yes, I've read every single post on this). Does this look correct?

Bestech D140 BMS, 12s4p Li-Ion.

Any advice or suggestions for changes appreciated!

Looks pretty solid. Just make sure to fuse the charge port.
