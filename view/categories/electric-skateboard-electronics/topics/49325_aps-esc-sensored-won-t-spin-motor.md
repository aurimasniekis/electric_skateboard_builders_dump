I received my ESC from APS yesterday and tried to run my motor with it but it seems like it didn´t left the programming mode. I installed the software and programmed my ESC, I don´t know what I did wrong.

Edit: I connected the sensor cable and it doesn´t go into the programming mode anymore. But it still won´t spin. It tries but the motor won´t even do one spin. So what is now the problem?

Remote and RX properly bound? Charged and correct pins?

They don’t like bench testing very much. Start spinning it with you hand and then it should work once it is spinning.
