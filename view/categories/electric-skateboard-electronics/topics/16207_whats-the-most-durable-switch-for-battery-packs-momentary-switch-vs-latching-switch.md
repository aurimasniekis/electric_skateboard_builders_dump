Guys can anyone give me advice on what's the most durable switch that can withstand all vibrations  ? 

I remember that back in the day @onloop and @torqueboards experienced some problems with their switches in their battery packs. Which switch is the most durable ? Momentary or Latching ? ..i know that regular toggle soft switch works probably the best but it just does not look as cool as the led ones. 
  
Momentary switch:

Latching switch:

Regular toggle soft switch:

Do you get a lot of vibrations while reading? Im perhaps new to elongboarding but for me it looks like there should be just a really good fit / soft material around, for it not to ruin other parts or itself..

I don't think those are rated high enough amps.  Snap!

It depends on how your soft on and off circuit works. Most of us require a latching or toggle switch because the circuit has to remain closed to turn on the BMS. A momentary switch would probably be the best but would require a smart BMS to operate. Boosted's BMS, Mellow's and Raphael's all have this feature.
