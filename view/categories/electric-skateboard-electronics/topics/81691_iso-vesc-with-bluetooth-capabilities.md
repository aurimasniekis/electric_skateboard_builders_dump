So currently, I have a torqueboards VESC working with my build and I originally hoped to use a Bluetooth module I got from Jared at Build Kit Boards. I recently learned that the torqueboards VESCs do not have Bluetooth capabilites. Does anyone have any suggestions of VESCs that have Bluetooth capabilities while being the same size as the torqueboards vesc if not smaller(I am working in tight quarters and need it to be able to fit on it‚Äôs side, there‚Äôs is just enough room for the Vesc I have now in my enclosure) ? And if possible on the cheaper side but something reliable (I know, cheap = not reliable, but I‚Äôll see). I‚Äôd like it to be reliable in FOC and be able to be reliable especially when climbing hills (and some varient of 4.12 with ble capabilites). Thanks.

How can a VESC based esc don‚Äôt support Bluetooth? 
Don‚Äôt get it.

I don‚Äôt know man üòÇ, I even contacted them questioning it. Apparently it‚Äôs because they ‚Äúhave no need for it‚Äù. I don‚Äôt me to bash torqueboards, don‚Äôt get me wrong I love their products and they‚Äôre great, but this is my only complaint. (I still use their products on my builds though).

Their 4.12 escs are meh... almost caught my board on fire.... but I still use their motors and other products, just not their esc's

As for their 12s esc that's not a vesc

maybe i¬¥m wrong, but there is an uart port on the tb vesc and they run the usual firmware. there is no reason why a bluetooth module shouldn¬¥t work!

Bluetooth should be capable on TB vesc. I'm about to find out for myself. And I know I've seen a couple of builds here with TB and BT

Lemme know what you find because I know they have the correct port, but they said it doesn‚Äôt support it, also if it does support it then what am I doing wrong, I have set the module up on my phone, I have set the module to 9600 and have the VeSC setting to ppm and uart so I don‚Äôt know what would be wrong.

@Andy87 was it just early focbox that the rx and tx had to be swapped?

like @J0ker3366 said, try to swap rx and tx on the jst plug.
should work after.

I can‚Äôt really swap the cables as they are set solid in the 6 pin connector, but I‚Äôve checked and rx on the ble module goes to the tx on the VeSC, and vice versa, this is correct right?

You can lift up the fixation a bit and take out the pin from the jst.

They do have Bluetooth capabilities, I'm using a TB vesc with a bluetooth module right now, it's just that the TB agents, Alex and Ralph don't know anything, Dexter definitely knows how to set it up and it's quiet easy.

@torqueboards -Dexter 

For the @mccloed modules from @psychotiller you only need to use 5 of the 6 pins, I'll upload a picture when I get home from schoolüòÇ

Ok, cause I have a ble module from buildkitboards

And I do put it in this port right

Looks good to me. Should have 7 pins. Bluetooth works fine on my TB vesc.

Remember to set the setting in the vesc (can't remember where) to "PPM+UART" and set the baud rate to "9600"

I‚Äôve tried setting the app setting to ppm and uart before and have been sure to set my baudrate to 9600. I don‚Äôt know why it isn‚Äôt working, in the app, it just says connecting to VESC forever. Usually this is a baudrateproblem but I don‚Äôt know. Could this be a Ble module problem because otherwise everything is correct right? What apps and phones do you guys use? Could it be a problem with one of the rx/thx pins not fully in?

I saw the TB recently dropped the price of the ESC‚Äôs. If they are now saying it dosnt work for the new batch my guess is that they removed some of the UART components to reduce the cost as they aren‚Äôt required for basic function. Just my 2 cents

To preface this, I hand flashed the new firmware on these modules, and tested each one before sending. The only problems people have had were with recent TB VESC and Flipsky 6.6.

It's was proobly Ralph or Alex that said that, they didn't even know how to setup the Bluetooth modules on any vesc lol.
