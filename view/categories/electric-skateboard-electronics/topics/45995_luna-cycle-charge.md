I’m looking at getting this charger for my 10s4p battery. It has a 1-5 Amp output and can charge up 80,90 or 100%.

So my main question has anyone used one of these and I’m pretty sure this would work with my board but I just wanted to confirm.

It should work if its cc/cv but it should be as it is for ebikes

Only the charging plug may not fit but thats easy to change

I was going to make an adapter because I have a 2.1mm barrel connector for my charge port but I have a xt60 connector and the matching barrel connector.
