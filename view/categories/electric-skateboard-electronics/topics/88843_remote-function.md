Hi,

So I have a Flipsky FSESC 6.6 and this ![remote|375x500](upload://tsjMPufPkGjH52ccDiINhhTBtJu.jpeg) remote, does anyone know how to connect the little receiver on the left to the FSESC ?

Where did you get that remote from?  Are there any other buttons on it?

I got it from amazon. A seller called Van Pro. There is a rocker thumb switch for forward/reverse speed and reverse/brake.

There is a two or three position switch to control fast/slow mode and there is the on/off button switch at the bottom of the remote and lastly the flathead screwdriver switch about where your middle finger resides if grasping it normally.

I hope this answers your question

No, I was wondering if it had a "pair" button like [this one](https://forum./t/how-to-bind-the-mini-remote/95)

^^ in the images for the product the last one is a video with walkthrough of setup, basically looks like put bind loop plug onto bottom pins of receiver, then on remote while powered off hold button on front of it and power on

This is typically called "binding" the transmitter and receiver in the RC world or "pairing" when it comes to bluetooth but terms are basically interchangeable and same concept linking one device to another (so they ignore other devices using the same protocol basically).
