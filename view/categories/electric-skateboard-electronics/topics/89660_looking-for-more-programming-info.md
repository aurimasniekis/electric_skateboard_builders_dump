Hello Esk8 builders!

I'm seeking some extra help on vesc programming...
From what I've understood when you use dual motors you cut the battery continuous current in half.
I have a TB 12S4P pack, after looking around on the forums it seems some people run these packs on 40+ Amps even with a dual setup even though it's rated for 60A continuous, which I thought means you should run 30A?
A bit confused, if this is safe am I missing out on any huge performance difference? (I have 2x 6374 motors) Is it worth disassembling my board and reprogramming for, and how is this safe (if it is), can someone explain?

Thanks!
