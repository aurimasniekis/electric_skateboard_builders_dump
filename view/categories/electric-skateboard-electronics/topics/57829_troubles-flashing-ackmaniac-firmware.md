Hi all,

I just downloaded/compiled the vesc_tool from @Ackmaniac , however when I upload the firmware, everything goes fine except the fact that it actually doesn't update it. I've two vesc from diyeletricskateboard. Do I need to update the bootloader too?

Looks like. But best is to ask them if it has a bootloader.

@torqueboards can you confirm that we need to update the bootloader in order to install ackmaniac's firmware?

Ive updated a dozen or so TB VESC's to @Ackmaniac 2.54 and never had an issue.  I would check the cable, drivers, etc.

Where you got the firmware? Is the one bundled with the app?

@torqueboards isn’t the HW supposed to be 4.12?
```

Yes it's a 4.12 if you talk about this one.

Yes, that what I got. Weird (check my screenshot) that it shows 4.10. Is there any difference worthy?

It shows that by default. That's fine, between 4.10, 4.11 and 4.12 there are only minor hardre modifications. For all of them the Firmware is the same.

so when you click read hardware and firmware button it still shows the old 3.38? cause I too had a new tb vesc which I moved from 3.38 to 3.101 with ease

One moved without issue to Ackmaniac FW, the other one after flashing still returns the old FW :(

Hm. Have you tried reflashing it? If not just contact TB and go single drive for now
