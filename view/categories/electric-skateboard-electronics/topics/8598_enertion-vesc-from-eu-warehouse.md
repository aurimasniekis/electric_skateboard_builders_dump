Yes its True.  I ordered a Vesc last week.
On the tracking link i can See that the Destination place is Belgium.  The Vesc will be shipped to me from Belgium.

I asked on the online chat a few days ago if my vesc would be shipped from Belgium and they said they don't have facilities in Belgium yet?
Would be handy to know if this wasn't the case.

This depend on where your from, and if their distributor have it in stock... But you don't technically order from a specific warehouse, because they don't have facilities all over the world, they use small distributor.

Hi,

Two weeks later:
Hello,

Thank you for your valued inquiry. 

We do not have stock of VESC at EU warehouse. We ship VESC directly from US.

Regards
Now I'm totaly confused. Where is true? @onloop

Same here! They said at the beginning that they will ship straight away after they' ll get my payment. I had many things ordering. So i had my package, i was so happy to get it, and guess what, no vesc in package. Also no e-mails, no added notes why there is no vesc, no sorries. Come on! They should inform customer about any changes, isn't it? I wrote them about my concerns, they said sorry to hear that, also that they send a lot of vescs to EU warehouse and it will be sended from there by end of the week.I was happy that they'll come from EU so no that 22% tax and so. Of course nothing was sended, i contacted again them. Again they said that they were too busy, so will send it from EU warehouse in 5-7 working days. It didn't came from there, it came from US, again no emails,nothing about that it's sended from there. I wasn't ready that it will come from US, i wasn't ready to pay 22% tax for it, also i couldn't leave it in revenue, because they charge 10 euros per day for holding my package. I sended email to enertion again about their communication problems and so. They again sorry for that, they can't say anything  about sending, so they will forward my e-mail to sending department. So still nothing, no emails.. 

Normally if somebody order something, company should inform about every step they do with order (how many time for getting package ready, when sended, from where sended, how many days for shipping) In my case only- thanx for order, i got just half package, e-mailing from my side, false information about sending from EU from there side...

First:
I chated withsupport guy and he said that all mechanical parts come from Australia to Belgium and vesc directly from USA. Then support guy said that only vesc/motor bundles come through Belgium to European customers and all the others directly from Australia or USA. 
Is it too hard send all products from Belgium warehouse? 

Second:
I ordered two bundles, but I wasn't able to order anything else with these. Now I have to order 12mm motor pulleys separately. And thats grazy expensive, because shipping is 36e for 12e part and it is over 25e altogether so I have to pay taxes. There should be more more shipping options for small parts. That shipping is real sale killer. 
Why you can't send pulleys just in normal letter which is very cheap. It would be nice to choose between 12+36+12=60e and 12+5=17e.  @onloop

Does there seem to be a problem with the Belgian supply chain?

```
All our stock in Europe is sold out now.
Getting more stock into Europe can only happen when we have surplus stock. Which we don't have atm. And it would take weeks to build that stock level up and never are the customers prepared to wait.

The vesc is made in usa and we need to send about 200 into Europe each batch to make it feasible. But we don't have 200 in stock at them moment. 

Demand is outstripping supply & international logistics is challenging.

So for now we are shipping vesc from USA direct. 

The r-spec and vesc bundle will ship from Europe. 

Note: You can buy vesc from @elkick if you want it  sent from inside EU.

Thanks for getting back to me @onloop. 
 Mine was ordered on the 6th August. I have the feeling it may be lost somewhere as enertion support helped me track it. The link that support sent me wasn't working but when they tracked it they said it had arrived at the Belgium warehouse on the 1st of sept and was being sent direct to me from there.

Having less than 200 IS not "running out". You could never run out with a constant inventory of just 1. Does not mean you have an endless number on your hands at every time.

You are not alone in your issues.  Support seems to have disappeared off the face of the planet.  I've been waiting a week and half for a response as to where my VESC is.  If I don't hear back or receive the vesc in the next week or so I will be forced to start a chargeback.  Something I don't want to do, but what else can we do if we are being ignored and our orders aren't being delivered? :frowning:

TRY TO RELAX!!! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I understand waiting can be frustrating but you are in another country and logistics is complicated especially when people want the lowest prices possible. You might consider buying direct from @elkick if you are not comfortable waiting for overseas shipments.

I assure you every single order of vesc is being shipped ASAP, they are in stock in our USA warehouse & then they get shipped to EU either directly to the customer's address or in some special cases through our Belgium warehouse (this changes depending on supply volumes in our US warehouse)  

if you haven't got a tracking number there is a chance there is a problem so please email our staff support@enertionboards.com and ask for an update.

If you haven't heard back from them maybe they missed your email, or maybe it's in the trash, i suggest replying to the email confirmation you got and politely asking for an update.


NOTE: Sending a package from one side of the earth to the other can take between 10-60 days depending on customs and handling procedures of each country. In many cases tracking numbers may change during the journey.

I am relaxed, but I have run into so many issues my patience is towards it's end.  I order products from all over the world all the time.  I know all about delays and timescales customs etc.

However I ordered the VESC on the 16th of August and it was showing as in stock and shipped from the EU.  (Belgium I believe).    It took 10days before my item was set to shipped, that is a long time for an in stock item. I was not concerned as these things happen.  

After a week or so of it not turning up I looked again and discovered the shipping tracking number link goes no where and the number is not recognised by any of the main shippers that I tried.

Again no issues.  I sent an email into your support system on 13th Sept almost a month since my initial order.  I had a response from Billy saying the following:
_"Thank you for your valued order._
_First of all I apologize for the delay in order. I am forwarding your ticket to the shipping department. They will get back to you as soon as possible."_

Again not a problem that's great, but 10 days later and two followup emails I still have had no response?

What exactly am I supposed to do when your support team don't respond and my order doesn't turn up?  Wait forever?  Waiting 10days for any response would test the patience of most customers when there has been an issue.

I find it interesting that despite me and other complaining about the delays, we haven't had a response on the threads or via support about it until I mentioned chargebacks.

I've a simple couple of questions:
1.  Where is my VESC?
2.  When is it likely to arrive?
3.  What is the tracking number/courier so I can track it?

None of those seem like asking too much to me?

If you have bought the warranty you need to prove that you got your order later and not on the date of  purchase... You wont have the problem but patient costumers who have said nothing will get into this issue more likely...
I dont want to say that this issue will ever occur but it can and will be a bit annoying...

@gordy I can understand it is frustrating. We are also frustrated when delays occur. Some people get orders quickly and there are no issues and everything works smoothly. That is the case 95% of the time.

Then there is the other 5%.... Sometimes some orders don't go smoothly & many times it is due to multiple issues and sometimes we don't know about these issues until a customer or multiple customers email us asking questions.

Sometimes we don't know the answers. This obviously makes it hard to reply to emails with any facts. Sometimes our staff make mistakes too and forget about emails or process our international bulk orders incorrectly. Sometimes people get other people's orders. Or they get the wrong qty meaning someone else misses out.

We build vesc in US. Then shipping to EU. Then (sometines) our distributor processes them and send to end user. There are many manual process. 

So why didn't you get your order in a timely manner? Because something went wrong.

Will you get your order? Yes.

Are we always trying to ship orders as fast as possible? Yes.

If you would like more specific info or perhaps more freqent updates about your order feel free to email us each day or weekly and we will provide any info we have. support@enertionboards.com

That's the thing I have emailed support and I've heard nothing back?  I can appreciate there can be delays.  I don't mind that, however I am completely in the dark as to what is happening.

If I still haven't received either the product or any news in a week or so's time what am I supposed to do?  What would you do in my situation?

Also if a product is being shipped via the US to the EU you should really make that clear in the description as it will set expectations better.

Your case seems almost identical to mine. So I guess I'm one of the 5% too. 
First it was being shipped directly then from Belgium then US again then I was told if I wanted a vesc I should have ordered from Germany. Elkick? 
I have had almost no replies from support and when I have managed to catch the online chat they have almost spoken in riddles. The last almost clear information I had at the start of this week was that my vescs have been shipped from Belgium (no tracking provided) and I will definitely receive them this week. 
Well, it's Friday night now and no vescs have arrived and no update from the numerous mails to support so I'm at a bit of a loss too.

@gordy I've just clicked the enertion chat on the site again and given Billy C my original tracking number and my order number...
In a flash they've given me a new tracking number from Belgium post which shows that a parcel being received by Belgium post today that is destined for me!
So give the chat a go and see how you go. Perhaps your parcel was dropped off with mine!!

on the destination on your tracking page does it have your house number/street address, mine only has postcode and town?

maybe it only shows that on the website but I saw someone else on the forum mention they had sent it with an incomplete address

Hi @LukeL,
the original tracking link goes nowhere. I got a new link sent on the live chat.
As you say the address shown on this page seems incomplete, just a name, town and postcode. Fingers crossed this is just how it is displayed on the tracking page for simplicity.
