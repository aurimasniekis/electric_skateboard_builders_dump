Enertion's just listed the FOCBOX Unity:

https://www.enertionboards.com/raptor-accessories/copy-of-new-focbox-motor-controller-1/?setCurrencyId=8

Bulks discount price is $200 per unit, I thought maybe we can collect names to see how large of a USA order we can put together.

Not taking any payments yet, just getting a head count.

It's not determined who's actually doing the group buy.  I will hand this data over to whoever handles it.

Been waiting for this monster esc and price is sweet at the group and non group buy cost.
I have the perfect board to put this in.

Almost feels like all these 6.0 iteration aren't worth the price considering what the Unity brings for ease of configuring boards and all the included hardware added onto the  PCB and software tool.

If you need 120a plus ,sure grab a 6.0 iteration of vesc but all other fingers point to unity imo.
Honestly Bravo to Enertion if this esc is as good as it sounds.

Not quite a bms, the unity can completely shut itself down in a major under voltage situation (configurable)

The switch is a high side momentary, not like the Vedder switch design (low side latch)

so...there's about 50 units across 36 people wanting to get in on this.

@JLabs, how you feeling about running it?

i can do it if you're not feeling up to it. 

also, i've got a discount code that'll basically wipe out the shipping.  all said, should be about $220 shipped for one.

Also said shipping isn't final and could change.  So I am waiting to hear back.  
But then they same person has also told others  that shipping is correct so I don't know....

I feel like if we are buying 21+ of these Enertion could swing the free shipping our way because how often are they going to be selling that many at one time. 
So price would be $200 for the group buy which is what I spent on my 2 focboxes on Black Friday. 
I would be in.

on his youtube live stream. he said shipping will not budge unless you order larger quantity like 50-100+. Also it's express shipping so it's suppose to ship and arrive within a few days according to him.

China Post could be used and it would make no difference because no one knows when they are supposed to be shipped anyway so another 30 days waiting for it to arrive once posted in exchange for saving 30$ per unit seems much better

Yeah I think it is major bullshit to charge for shipping on them I understand it is a lot of weight but normally it is 300+ for free shipping. And it is only express if it is equivalent to primes 2 day shipping. And judging by the Black Friday money clip debacle causing extended delays and some people still didn’t get them I think they should save face and dish out the free shipping on bulk deals

Fuck that it’s bullshit to change the price thatwas in writing from enertion that plus the crazy shipping they are charging on 21 units. That is the one thing I hate about them is that there are changes in prices to the go box and they say no the price hasn’t changed at all. My company just had 3 analytical systems shipped from Australia to New Jersey and it was like $250 for shipping freight and all together they weighed around 300lbs. So they are making some serious money even on shipping.

I mean *technically* we have some power. As I see it this 4 day sale is to finance future orders for the Raptors 2.1’s upgrades. I give it a 30-40% chance they’re betting on group buys to get a good chunk of money for it. Even more so if the people who decided to delay their Raptor 2 for the Unity did so without having to really pay anything. Mind you this is all complete speculation , but I’m interested to see if shipping is suddenly free if both Group buys don’t pan out and the amount of preorder sales is far below target.

Shipping is never "Free", in 4 days the price of Unity goes up 20% - 30% & you will still need to pay for shipping.

There is no cheaper time to buy the Focbox Unity, the price will never be this low ever again, even with "free shipping" you will be paying more. 

**Shipping is never FREE, its either built into the price or paid for separately**

Its almost midnight on the East coast. Tomorrow I will open up the group buy to orders and everything will be processed on my website. I will need to calculate everything out (like transaction and shipping fees per pc)

Just as an FYI.. it will be credit card only like the TSG group buy. If I do PayPal they will hold the money for 6 months because they don’t want businesses to grow (rapidly)

There's already 47 people signed up (never done a group buy so I'm not sure what percentage of people will follow through). We're out of the 10-20+ and starting to get into the 50+ units range. I feel like come tomorrow there will be plenty of people signed up giving y'all a lot more negotiating power for a buy this large. Maybe we can see a lower price come tomorrow :smiley:

@onloop can you explain the reasoning behind the price increase already because yesterday the price was $199.00 and not it is $209 why the $10 price change in a? Did you get a lot more preordered than you though so figured might as well mark it up? Plus the shipping was free during the Black Friday sale of $300 or more when the Focbox was marked to $100 each. I understand it is express but how many days is express considered to me it is close to Amazon Prime shipping.

Also you can not say that the shipping of 21 units weight more then 50lbs. I know that in UPS and FedEx there is a published price for shipping and negotiated price of shipping. As a person who ships stuff daily and having arranged freight shipping from Australia to East Coast of the USA for a freight that weighted around 300 lbs and it was around $250 so that there says that there says enertion is even making a good chunk of cash on shipping alone.

I am always changing prices of products on our website mostly it depends on foreign currency exchange rates, or sometimes our suppliers increase prices, there are many reasons actually, In this case I simply keyed in some approximate AUD prices into our backend (all our prices are default AUD) then when i finally had a chance to check the currency conversion i realised the exchange rate had changed & therefore needed to make an adjustment. 

Is there anything else you want to know about our financial & pricing structures?

ALSO; in 4 days the price is changing again, it's going up again, there will be no bulk pricing.

Yes I am being serious... And your using AliExpress pricing structure to your advantage in this argument..

Why would you use FedEx for a China shipment.

And no shit it costs money to ship things.... No need to be patronising

Using fastest shipping methods is normally always better, whether its fedex or DHL or some other express option, faster always cost more.

Would it be possible for you to ship one Unity to Japan? Really want to get in to this groupbuy!
The price on enertion´s site went up to 249$ by now.

Next day shipping to the same city for a focbox should cost $2 in China

Even if I pick it up from your warehouse you would make a random excuse

So the unity is $287 in AUD? Judging but the exchange rate fluctuations from yesterday the price actually should have gone down as since beginning of June the AUD has dropped in the exchange rate from .77 to .72 so basically your $10 price increase of the Unity has now become an almost $14 increase in AUD. Same thing with the regular Focbox has had a steady increase in price when this exchange rate drop has occurred. 

Don’t get me wrong the unity is an amazing looking piece but come the is already a company that is putting out nearly the same thing just with the enertion brand tied to it for $150. You said it would be competitively priced. For 21+ units it is and here we have a list that shows almost 50 units at one time plus whatever everyone else has already preordered. 50 units to a few people is a shit load and your saying you can’t drop the price even slightly or throw in the shipping come one man that is clearly a sign of not giving a shit about the customers. When are we supposed to expect these unities to be delivered. Because pretty much everyone in this group buy was around for the Black Friday debacle that enertion put people through last year.

The flagging (or threat of flagging) of comments that don't violate any forum guidelines is getting rediculous..  The argument that this is such a better deal then the VESC 6, well that's true... but that's only if you buy the 'official Trampa' one.  There's what, 3 other versions of it, and the most expensive of those is like $170ish, or so?  I'm still trying to make sense of the many comments that said the cost of the Unity would be very competitive to buying two FOCBOX's.  So I think to the average person that means at most it won't cost twice the amount of a single FOCBOX.  Yes it comes with a anti-spark and Bluetooth unit and some other stuff, that sounds great, but a retail price of $399 is far far from competitive, I think most would agree.

One of my issues is that they are comparing it to the vesc 6 which it is not it is a between 4.12 and 6. and they want a Vesc 6 price. So now what firmware would you load to it from the @Ackmaniac vesc tool because my sensor detection didnt work in bldc with the vesc tool or the enertions bldc tool.  I had to update the firmware and to acks and set it in foc for my sensors to be detected and that is not something that I want to have to give up.  In the description for the unity it says control interface canbus are you going to need a can bus for this since it is built for dual motors. 

An why is there no comment, acknowledgment, or explanation of my statement about the AUD to USD conversion because that is backed up but facts directly from the exchange rates charts.

Regarding the Vesc 6 vs. Vesc 4 thing, I haven't seen a test that could demonstrate one real world performance difference that demonstrated how two vesc 6's is superior to the Unity. Both can push about 80 amps so power isn't one. I know it uses 3 phase shunt amplifiers vs 2 lowside, but realistically the benefits of this aren't tangible to the eskate rider. Meanwhile let me list some of the ways the Unity is tangibly better and more reliable than two vesc 6s (in no particular order) :

-Protection circuitry on hall sensor input
-Size, more compact with same power
-Easy and quick custom designed setup app
-Integrated bluetooth 
-Integrated smart switch offering uvlo for using smaller cheap charge only bms

We are currently asking a price which is even lower than buying 2 of the chinese ripoff vescs! And they didnt have to shoulder any r&d cost/effort. We've spent an enormous amount of time developing firmware and testing and adding features to this thing to make sure its rock solid. It's going to blow vesc 6 chinese ripoffs out of the water.

@Deodand,

I appreciate your comments and have viewed the videos released on the development and alpha and beta testing.  The design is very eligent. I have been in the PCB industry in the past and doing a single sided design has so many advantages.  Have you put the design through any halt testing or continuous thermal cycling over extended period?  Will you be providing videos from the trip to the supply base in China? I would love to see the PCB laminate as well as assembly shop.  I also understand your tool will be very easy for programming however will it have the fine tuning capabilities of the Ack. Tool?  

Keep up the great work,

Kevin

I won't be able to make it on the upcoming china trip unfortunatley, but I know Roan is going so expect some fun content coming out from that trip. @Blasto and/or I might make it out there when production starts ramping up to demo the test jig etc. If so expect some less professional looking but more engineering nerd-out vids from us :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:  

Haven't gotten to that testing yet unfortunatley, been total craziness pumping out revisions left and right (think we are on revision #12 of the prototype) 

Going to try and support as much of the fine tuning tools that effect real world performance as possible and drop a lot of clutter to maintain simplicity. 

That said, we will also offer a download to a full pc tool which is just modified vesc-tool for dual motor driver for those that still want access to all the low level dangerous settings :slight_smile:

That's if your are comparing the pre-sale group buy price to their retail price.  If you were to do a price comparison with the same promotions, you can get two of the VESC 6 knock offs for like $200, shipped.  I mean if someone was to say they can buy four of the VESC 6 clone for the same price as one Unity, I think it would be immediately pointed out how the circumstances are different in that instance. Regardless, the Unity seems like a great product :slight_smile:

Fair point on pre-sale vs. Retail. Hopefully we have good sales and because of that we can keep the price down. I think just like with the focbox there will be sales from time to time when you can get it lower than retail price, and there will also be local reseller's you can use.

This is why ive tried hard to stay away from groupbuys on ESCs. I would like to see these companies test their items on an uncut video showing the current and voltage passing thru see if the ESC can really hold up. Now It may be hypocritical but I ordered some chinese vesc6 looking forward to testing them. Still it seems this unity doesnt quite bring it to the table for me. Hopefully someone can test on video that would help justify buying this for anyone who is interested. Also if we all just get into UNITY we can NOT buy anything and the companies get nothing sure we dont get anything either but we dont loose money too. My 2 cents on the bill

Here's a vid of me pushing about 2 kW through the unity up a massive hill:

I guess the possibility of deception is there, but honestly I'm here to make badass motor controllers not sell you lies. Anyone in san diego thats been to blacks beach can attest that this hill is a monster if a bit short. But you can see I finish with plenty of thermal bandwidth left (start at 40 celcius end at 50 celcius, unit maxes out around 100 celcius)

@Deodand can you explain what firmwares there will be and what Vesc tools it will be compatible with because I run a Mac format of ackmaniac’s tooland when I did the firmware update it froze my computer with over 8gb of ram and ssd and I had to restart the tool. Also I have racerstar sensored motors that would fail the hall sensor test in the bldc took from enertion it wasn’t until I put a Acks firmware in foc and was able to do to get successful hall sensors detected. So that is my concern is because I would be pissed if I spent the money on the unity and wasn’t able to run my motors as sensored as they are currently configured

Well at launch there will be just the stock firmware which will be kept up to date, we will have the FOCBOX UI App which will work on PC/MAC/Android but unfortunatley not iphone due to licensing issues. This will offer quick easy setup but still have some depth. If you need access to deeper settings there will be a vesc-tool like alternative with everything available. 

I'm planning on spending an hour or two each day after we ship for the first month supporting people and debugging any issues that come up with the tools. Just hop on the forum if issues arise and we will get them sorted.

So what your saying is the app wont be avalible to iOS ever? It is somewhat common knowledge for the particular motors I am using to not have the motor sensors be detecting in bldc on the bldc tool. Hell I made a thread about it and @Deckoz immediately knew why and I have since carried that info to others using those motors.  

I think there needs to be more prototyped units in the hands of users and not just majority of resellers hands. Doing this will get you the real world info that you can take and figure out before they are released if issues arrise it will delay the November timeframe which I know it will piss people off because it would piss me off but I would understand if it was a quality issue or another bug that someone has found.  Then people will know it is a true quality item that they are getting with fewer bugs and enertion can save face after the major delays in the past or the clear film over the thermal pad that we have seen earlier this year.

Chances are we will be re-spinning the app from scratch to get an iOS version. It is too important to have support for that. But we won't have it ready by launch at this rate. We will make sure the BT dongle supports some of the iOS apps so iphone users aren't left out to dry. 

Like I said, we will fix issues as they are found. Would be awesome if we had the resources to send 100 beta units out and get everyone's feedback but it just isn't feasible with the size of the market. Currently we have about 15 units being tested so hopefully we clean up a lot of the issues from that testing.

Hi Jeff!
About this unity.. What happens if the master dies during a ride? Does the slave shut down as well, just like the focbox single would do using can-bus?
Is out possible to run these as two separate units controlled by two receivers (one remote 😏) for better reliability/safety?
```

## \#109 Posted by: Deodand Posted at: 2018-08-16T19:24:21.530Z Reads: 130

Well if you are only doing two wheel drive there is no master and slave! Both motors are being controlled by a single processor that's part of what makes the unity so simple and easy to use. That said if one motor faults out for some reason the second motor will continue functioning so long as the MCU failing isn't the cause of the fault, or the fault isn't global like battery under-voltage etc.

Poorly written firmware would be the most likely culprit. Previously hall inputs could blow up the mcu if they shorted to phase leads but we fixed that. Greater than 5v signal into any of the external communication interfaces... lots of things. That's why thorough testing and good design is so important.

## \#114 Posted by: uigiroux Posted at: 2018-08-16T20:07:10.029Z Reads: 131

So those things are pretty much not possible for us to accidently mess up that way, with the new easy setup that you've implemented in this design then?  A previous VESC could get fried for improper settings very easily from my understanding, so this has all necessary safeguards in place to prevent that kinda mistake?

Damn, I'm really wishing this sale lasted longer.  I won't have the money until like a week from now...  FML..

Only thing I would have also liked to see in this design is a heatsink in the bottom with fins so it could be mounted with the bottom exposed for better cooling...  Other than that this sounds better and better...

 That is the goal, eliminate as much user error as possible to keep your guys purchase safe! It's a win for all parties involved.

Honestly in all my testing I haven't managed to get it very warm at all, but agree that more heat-sinking is always nice (plus it looks freaking cool). Probably there is some crazier setups than what I have that you guys will throw a unity in and really put it through its paces. Excited for that.
