A pop from the FOCBOX? wasnt it the spark sound?
Also, were the phase wires connected to something? Maybe they touched and the pop was a FET/DRV. 
try opening it up and see if there is anything visibly burned

Oh, so it was the spark that you heard? I think that it should work because before i found out about antispark plugs and switches my switch was disconnecting connectors :D

Does my motor need be connected before I plug in the loop key just to check the Vesc..have the motor wires insulated with electrical tape on the Vesc (gotta change the bullet connectors

The pop from a spark is normal, its the capacitors charging up rapidly. Not great for the connectors if you do it repeatedly, which is why an antispark switch or antispark connector is recommened. But if your polarities are correct and everything still works, it was just a dramatic spark and popping noise.

No... You can program the focbox excluding motor detection without the motor plugged in.

You need bldc tool as the focbox comes stock with 2.18

Other wise if your using vesc tool or ack firmware you will need to flash before you can connect and read.

No.

You need to select the com port that the vesc is connected to. Then click connect. 

Motors not connected have nothing to do with the "not connected" in the lower right.
