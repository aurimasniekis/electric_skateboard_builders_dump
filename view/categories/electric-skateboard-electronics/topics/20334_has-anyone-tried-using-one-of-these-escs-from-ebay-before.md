It clearly states that the esc can only handle 1350 watts max so you would need to use something like a 300kv motor or something like that

(edit) this might work, Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5055-280kv Brushless Outrunner Motor (1510w max)

Personally, I think you'd be better off getting the FVT 6s car esc and a separate remote/receiver. At least the FVT will have some type of cooling. And it's known to work.

@Namasaki Problem with the fvt is it is only known to work for a limited time, and the brake function is pretty much a joke.

@Michaelinvegas honestly, I have no idea.  I just saw it and ordered one.

I wouldnt say fvt 120 6s version brake is a joke.. it is quite a strong one but it needs to be correctly dialed in.. as the gearing ratio, wheel size and travel lenght of remote's trigger might play a part that the brake is too sharp. 

So yeh.. not really vesc precision but at least way better than boat/heli esc with no brakes or very primitive ones.

The mountain board setup @Okami post previously is mountain board from China factory. 

and this is the Dual ESC they using. 
One of my taiwan friend had bought the complete set and run quite a while, everything going okay. top speed have 38-40kph with 70kg rider. 
I am not sure ebay ESC is it same with the one i posted here. 

This kind of ESC is ride-able but not for hardcore people drift around or climbing a big hill.

@mccloed just set up a pneumatic board yesterday with one of these dual 10s esc's. Doesn't seem to make a difference whether you use sensors or not. Board starts from a stop smoothly and runs quietly. Immediate concerns are that the esc seems to get pretty hot. Not melting hot, but hot. Also, with a 10s4p battery and 170 kv motors it only has a about a 15mph top speed. That said, it cruised through deep grass with no problem. Could be geared differently to reach 18mph or maybe change the motor kv to 200. For a ittle more top end.

He will be testing it on trails more next week.

any updates?

im looking for a new ESC's for my E-Mountainboard. if these work they are a steal! 

My board specs:

Single Tacon Big Foot motor: 245kV 2700W max output. 
battery: 12s but can drop it to 10S
Gear Ratio: 5:1
Wheel size: 208mm

This was originally geared for a 6s setup but now that i went to 12s im getting a top speed of 55mph!!!

Will my setup draw too much current and blow the ESC?
```

afaik the tacon bigfoot is only 245kv.

We found that this esc does work. It actually is still working. But it  heats up to a point of concern. And for reasons unknown it will only go 19mph.

sorry typo, you are right it is 245kV; I will fix that.

to solve heating i can always put a heatsink and a fan.
the 19mph max speed is lame. Im assuming your board is geared to go faster then that? 

is there a way to calculate an estimate current draw for MTB? I am afraid i will draw more current then it can handle at 30A.

We had it set up on pneumatics. Geared for 25mph which is what we expected, but it wouldn't do it. @mccloed did note that it would do the 19mph anywhere though. It didn't care about deep grass or rough terrain. The issue was always just how hot it ran. Don't think you can configure anything other than the input voltage.

I actually still have a brand new dual esc/remote in a box! I'm going to use it to build my 9year old son an ATB.

could it be the firmware isn't letting the esc draw more current because of overheating?

How is the braking and start up? does it cog?

This is the same esc used in the meepo board and lots of other Chinese boards. I have two of them. They work as they are intended. They have a max 50 amps and 30A continues or something like that draw at 10s or 36v. There are people who have been using it at 12s but that wold be stretching it a bit. I think they are programmed to work with 90mm hub motors with a top speed of 22mph. 35kmh. That could explain the low speed you are getting. Remote works OK but it does noe have the strongest signal so try to keep the space between remote and esc unobstructed. I have lost connection once when I did put my hand in the pocket.

@psychotiller ok thanks. I assume if i raise my gear ratio it will help with cogging as well but that is more cash to be spent. I think I will give it a shot. BTW did you try it with sensored motors?

@Bshady3 I was riding slightly  uphill almost flat and realised the the speed was falling. But right after I took my hand with the remote  of the pocket it did connect right away and I did continue with the ride without a problem. Than a testet some more to make sure that that was the case. I have been thinking to solder a longer wire at the antenna but never got time for that.

@psychotiller so I'm getting one of these escs for my next build and I have an idea of how to go faster than 19mph. Basically you would use a lower kv motor and get most of your speed from the gear ratio. The reason this should work as the esc would have no way of knowing how fast it is going so it would base it on the erpm of the motor. So if we use a low kv motor that doesn't trip the erpm limit it can spin at its max speed. Then you can just use a low gear ratio like 1.8:1 or 2:1 to get the speed you want as well as large wheels. 

Have you made sure that when it only went 19mph it wasn't in slow mode? Lots have people have tested this board and said that slow mode limits it to 30km/h (19mph) and fast mode tops out at 40km/h (25mph). As for the heat issue a large heat sink on the fets and possibly a small fan should fix this issue.

definitely gets hot at 10s, recommend at least mounting on a steel or aly plate. speed depends on ratio running 15 32 and 83mm wheels. too much torque for the inbuilt acceleration curve with 83mm wheels
better with 97mm wheels.
hit 47km/hr with 97mm abec 11's and the acceleration is much better. by that I mean more natural - not all or nothing as it seems to be with 83mm wheels

but it needs 4-30v to be powered. I do not have sensors on my motors so the connection for the hall sensor is free and has a 5V rail. Do you think it will be a problem just to connect the Mini voltmeter to it (just the 5V and Ground not the other three connections)? 
I believe it only draws around 230mA.

Switched from this ESC (dual drive version) to dual Vesc (because the eBay esc broke)..the difference is night and day, especially when it comes to braking. Maybe the firmware has changed by now, but braking was not progressive. It only had full stop. With VESC I can precisely control the amount of braking, whilst keeping the ride smooth instead of jerky.

The remote of the ebay esc was awesome though. Currently using a bulky gt2e.

actually, I do have this controller's case and heat sink and battery indicator for sell.

The bms shut off and I was unable to power on the board.
The MTB version of this ESC consists of two identical PCBs that is connected via serial. After disconnecting the faulty PCB (one motor), I could turn on the board again. 

Tested both motors on the working PCB and they were fine.

Anyway, I have been told that this ESC is limited to 50a, which is simply not enough for a mountain board (on the flats it will do fine).

Also, esc has a max power out put 2600W. (1300W each motor) but the kit is 2200W each motor. 
Would this configuration still work?

or should i just get 2 of these?

I am thinking of getting this dual ESC.  But I have a problem.  Right now I have a lot of 3s2p lipo batteries.   If I buy this ESC and set it on 10s and use only 9s2s lipo on it would it be a problem?

## \#112 Posted by: bartroosen12 Posted at: 2017-10-24T15:09:12.502Z Reads: 301

If you only have 3S packs, use the 6S version or try to dissasamble a pack to get a 10S battery.
With a 10S battery your cut off will be around 32V so 3,2V per cell.
If you got a 9S battery the esc will cut off at 32V so around 3,55V per cell.
Actually it won't be a big problem, it will be better for your battery life, but you battery wil cut off earlier so less range.

And having the batteries cut off at 3.55v might be a good idea.  Because 3.2v cut off is too low according to some ppl.   Ppl say 10s caused the esc to heat up so by using 9s will reduce the heat issue.   I am not looking for a lot of topspeed.  18 to 19mph is enough for me.

Just finished my build with the ebay esc and the new 125kV hobbyking motor.
Did a few runs and got 17km with a 10S 5,2Ah battery. Topspeed was 30kmh but I'm going to replace the 15T motorpulley with a 20T to get 38kmh topspeed.
The esc runs very good, smooth startup, I've a small cheap heatsink from ebay and the esc is only a bit warm.
Only you need to watch out if you brake because if you pull the trigger to full brake it's just so strong so I need to get used to it.
But yeah very good esc for the price! It's totaly worth it. If you got some steeper hills just go for the dual version, I got like no hills so for me it's fine.

Or what wire goes where?  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/f/5f3e7768c6bceef572ac6aa04ea0473c861ef214.jpg" width="374" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/8/68b0c3ed102473ba4331a456b5a626bd2e4dd499.jpg" width="375" height="500">

The red and black wires go to the led part of the switch. The other two go to the actual switch. There should be simbols on the switch. **DO NOT CONNECT IT WRONG**, if you connect the red and black wires to the switch it will most likely fry the speed controller by creating a short

It's not too hard. Ok so connect the two wires that are on the old switch to the switching terminals on the new one and you pretty much done. You just need to get the spare two wires and plug them into the led terminals on the switch, done. If it doesn't the light doesn't work switch around the two second wires so they connect the right way

Nothing happens at all when plugged in. I am guessing like most escâ€™s (My only knowledge is from one other skate build and various drones) is that a sound is made when you plug it in, but for this one nothing happens at all. So definitely no connection to the remote. 
When you plug yours in does it initially make a connection sound (there is a buzzer on the esc which I assume is what itâ€™s for).

The remote canâ€™t connect to it. Itâ€™s as if there is no power getting into the esc at all (there is also a small push button on the esc itself, is this a hhind button?). On all videos I have seen and on all escâ€™s I have used, when you put power into them they do something, be it make a sound, led lights up etc. Is this not the case for all of them? I might be being guided by previous experience that is not true for all of them. 

I emailed banggood and was told it would work on one motor. Hopefully they can sort it out, their service has been very good to date. Very frustrating as two of us were making a similar build with different escâ€™s so I spent the weekend being very jealous of the other board working.

How to connect the remote and the control board.
1.connect the control board to power source.
2.turn the control board power on, wait 2 seconds, then press and hold the switch for about 6 seconds,till  the power    indication light flickering,then loose the hold of the switch immediately.
3.turn on the remote, then use a little stick to press the code synchronize switch on down left side of the remote.
4.turn off the remote, wait 2 second to turn it on again. wait till the remote's sinal light and the control board's power      indicate light both flickering. then connect success

Actually I just thought of something to check if there is power. You see where the switch connects to the board? The two wires connect to a 4 wire socket, if you can get multi meter and test it you should get a reading of about 5v (it doesn't really matter as long as there is some sort of voltage) on the other two pins on the socket. Please just make sure that you don't touch those pins together

No problem it's better to ask so next time you will know yourself. What you need to do first is check the voltage of all the wires on the esc. It should have 4 wires. The first two should read 5v the others should say nothing. Now the positive and negative wires on the plug connect to the two outside pins on the switch. The other two wires need to be connected to the C1 pin and N0 pin. I hope that makes sense

I made many attempts to connect the led switch to the esc but without any luck.   I connected red and black wires and the led lighted up.  Than I connected the 2 yellow wires but could not get the esc to turn off.  I even try to connect the 2 yellow wires in different combinations but still ESC would not turn off.   I will try to get a led on off button with 4 pins and see if that will help.  Maybe my led switch is broken.

I don't know. When I connected both legs of the switch it didn't operate.  When I connected 1 let, and not the other it did.  No clue but it seems to continue to work and the worst that can happen is the step-down convertor craps out so I have changed it.  If I put a SPDT LED switch on mine I will use the second method.

No.  The manner wiring did not work also.   I really think my led switch is broken.   I placed an order for a 4 pin led switch and will try it again when it gets here.   Right now.

If you think the switch is broken connect a multimeter to the n1 and NO1 pins and set it to the ohms setting. If the switch works when you press the button the meter should read somewhere around 10ohms or less if it doesn't read anything then it is most likely broken

It can't, but it won't fry it either. They're set up for different speeds basically- I have the dual belt ESC, and I gave it a try with hub motors. It works, but there's basically no torque, since it's expecting a 3:1 gear reduction. But again, still worked, and had a pretty terrifying top speed. I had it on a short board...so many wobbles. So, so many wobbles.

I think the other way around might work better? Because then you could play with the gearing a bit to fine tune it. It felt like it was pretty close to being functional, but not quite good enough to want to ride it around too much.

I got the dual belt setup from DIY eboards, and I'm comparing it to the the dual hubs on a meepo (same ESC in hub mode). I hooked the belt ESC up to some koolwheel hubs I had around, and that's how it rode- super high top speed (but perhaps part of that was just how it felt being on a short board?) and no torque at all; very slow start, couldn't really handle hills. Same ESC is now driving a belt setup and feels much better.

I think they do something with the current regulation depending on type of motor used? Sensored vs unsensored motors might also be an issue? I'm not saying I've performed definitive experiments or anything, but it was a pretty noticable difference

Theoretically it should be the same as using a single. Just leave the second set of phase wires disconnected. And make sure the set of unused phase wires don't short together while you're running it, it'll probably kill the ESC if that happens.
The cooling might be slightly better on a dual cause it's designed for 2 motors, so you may see slightly better performance under high loads, or climbing hills (if this ESC can even manage that), but other than that, should be the same as a single

Nope, should be exactly the same. As pennyboard said, just be sure to insulate the unused wires from each other; a short would be bad. I wrapped them in electrical tape and have continued to ride without issue; and when a new motor comes this week, I'll just plug it in and go back to the dual setup

Just remember that there seems to be some sort of speed limit. For 10s 150kV is the max and for 6s 250kV is the max. 

When I say max you can go higher you just won't gain anymore speed it sort of limits it. It seems to be around 6400 rpm that the limit happens

You will need to make up for loss in Speed with your gearing. For my build I will be running 2;1 on 97mm wheels, 195kV and 6s

Hello,
I also think about buying this esc. I am currently using an 80kv 70mm hubmotor and i want to get about 30kmh out of it and on calc.esk8.it it states that the motor can reach that speed with 10s.

So my plan was to use the non-hubmotor esc (because it has no speed limit) with my current hubmotor and a 10s battery.
Would that setup work or would i get problems because i am not using the hubmotor esc?

Why should the hubmotor esc not reach 30kmh?
Meepo board has the same hubmotor esc and can go like 35kmh.
If you go for the brushless motor esc the throttle will be very sensitive.
I should just stay with the hubmotor esc, I'm sure you will get a max speed around 35kmh.

I've talked to the seller and apparently the escs can be programmed, it's just that they are programmed at the factory and once they leave the factory you can't change the programming. 

If a seller figured out how to order these where you could either change the programming, or just ship them with an acceptable brake and throttle curve, it'd be a good esc for budget builds

a AMASS XT60 series Connector.

i am still waiting for the lipos. and the series connectors :( 

i exept that my first ride will be in mid february. 

i have read already, the the board itself has a max top speed of 20kmh.
but the hubs from the specs aren't also really faster. 

At the moment my complete calculation sums more to the 300(â‚¬) (incl. board) then to the 200, because of the additional stuff which you need for keep the stuff at the board itself :D

no need for the sensors wires. i assembÃ§ed mine yesterday and it works great. The only problem is that the esc limits the speed to 20km/h. remember to solder 6S or 7S or dissolder both if you want 10s in the lipo. I am using two 3s in series of 5000mah.
Tho it would be cool to know what are the connections to make for the "sensored" part of the motors.

The ESC doesn't have to guess the position of the rotor, so the motor starts up smoothly from a standstill. 

Startup performance on this ESC without sensors seem good though.

Sensors should help to have more torque when you accelerate from a complete stop. I have to say I don't feel any difference with this motors if I unplug the sensors.
The motor has a sensor wire with 1pin more than the esc sensors so I had to make a small wire in between the motor and the esc to make it fit. (Esc has no temperature sense and the motor has a temp sensor so I didn't need the temp sensor wire of the motor)

This is what he sent me: 

"Hi. rather than speed limit, I would say it is rmp limit. I did tried myself, it supporting not very good for high KV motors, like say more than 280KV will not be good. for some 280KV motors, it will still work, but will beeping (error detected). so you could use big motor pulley or big wheels to get speed.

another thing is, this board provided limited AMP. so if the motor run too fast, or the loaded too much. more than it can provide. it will beeping or cut off to protect the board too. this is kind of speed limit.

I've got one of the ESCs set-up on a board currently. I'm using 17/36 gearing at the moment because I don't have the right belt size to fit anything smaller at the moment. It seems to work and gets up to 20 mph easy. I haven't tested it going faster. 
Keep in mind, increasing speed means decreasing torque, so don't expect to build a 35mph board that can also climb moderate hills with this ESC

@pat.speed today when i got to my destination the cells where at 3.81volts and the speed was dropping. That was a 11km ride. I'll keep you updated.

The 3 Leds are indicators for the boards ''battery life''. From what I experienced:
3Leds 100% - 80%
2Leds 80% - 20%
1Led 20% - 0%
I can ride for a very long time with 2 Leds.

Guys, for 90kv direct motors should I choose the hub motor ESC or the brushless motor ESC. I understand it's a dumb question as the the most basic answer is already in my question however I don't understand how the throttle curve changes and I was thinking that a brushless motor ESC could be better!!??

Nope. Someone else tested this and the throttle curve is really bad. It is way too weak, the guy thought it was because geared setups have a gearing advantage which creates more torque so they make the throttle curve a lot softer. where as hubs don't have a gear reduction so it needs to have a stronger curve to get similar torque

Maybe try contacting the seller to see what they say. It could've been faulty from the start. These should be compatible with 6S. I had to de-solder some points on mine to make it compatible with 10S.

To elaborate on GrecoMan's less-than-helpful comment, a vesc will give you a lot more power/customization, albeit being much more complex than these plug and play ESCs. I have two boards; one with a vesc and one with this ESC. I loved being able to just plug it in and go. It's a good starting point, especially if it's your first board :slight_smile:

I think too that it must go faster. We have to test again, maybe it is the slow / fast switch.
I calculated the speed and must be around 40-45 km/h.
We have 2 motors wired up but that must be not the reason to go slow.

How well does this type of esc deal with heat? I mounted this esc on a aluminium heatsink (4mm) and put thermal paste between the esc and heatsink.  It's inside a fully sealed enclosure, you think it will be ok or do I need ventilation holes under the heatsink as well?

You need at least 2p if you're using 30Q cells. Otherwise you won't be able to get enough current. 
Also keep in mind these ESCs are made with a specific battery voltage in mind, and you'll have to solder and unsolder a few connections on the ESC to change voltages

That would be because your motor isnâ€™t powerful enough with that gear ratio and wheel size. Swap to a 190kV motor or change the gearing.

I would recommend the first as the esc has a rpm limit which is around 6400rpm any higher and your just losing potential torque if you had of gotten a lower kV. So for 10s a 170 - 190kv will be about right. A gear ratio change would also be good. 


After doing that it would give you a top speed somewhere around 40km/h. Just saying but this esc is not the best if you want high speeds due to the rpm limit

The capacitor is constantly failing. It's the right voltage and everything. I've changed 5 of them so far...
Now I bought a 250V high temperature one. The ESC gets extremely hot so i put an old cpu heatsink on it but it's still hot. Input voltage is 10s and I have a 190kv motor, 14:27 ratio and 90mm wheels but It's super weak. I can go max 16km/h on it...

And yeah, the ESC has the rpm limit and it's about 6400, but 190kv motor at 10s is 7980rpm max and with the 80% efficiency, the esk8.it calc says that it should go about 50kmh weighted

@banjaxxed  Not sure about the others but the chinese board I got to use has only 2 wires going to voltmeter.. There is something like 5 wires going to the led switch though and then 2 wires seperate and go to voltmeter directly from ledswitch.. at least it was / is this way for me.

@Wilsonliang777 I think on diyeboard page it said 2.1v and 1.1v is the same firmware, there are just changes to heatsinks and size.

I might try to take a photo of mine. Ive got ninestep chinese board, it does not have the same exact esc, as it runs unsensored but it also has wires connecting the 2escs together. So far I can tell that one pin from the led switch also goes to the second esc.. though not sure whenever u will still try anything with your 2 escs..

---

**On a side note** - _Does anyone know why my esc might be jittering / stuttering the motor?_ 

It starts to spin it up for 2-3 seconds then it jams it.. then it tries to start again. At first I thought it is related with belt or alignment, but I took off the belt and the top mounted esc is still doing this..

I might upload a video some time soon.. 

**Though this problem is only for the surface mounted esc**, the one under it runs just fine.. 

_How do I know this?_ Because when switching motor wires, the underside esc works fine but the top side esc jams both motors, so clearly this is not motors fault but something to do with the esc itself..

Thanks, I read this thread a little more thoroughly and the advice seems to be that an antispark is not needed, in saying that I've noticed it 'pops' even when powered down on connecting to the battery so not entirely convinced.

Hi @banjaxxed I tried to figure this out a while back. I put a voltmeter across the pins on that battery meter connection and came to the conclusion that there is a power and ground for each of the bars on the battery indicator that dickieho supplies. So each led has 2 wires.

It doesn't seem the most elegant design but would work. None of the pins had a voltage anywhere near what my battery pack was at.

This said, it'd be great if you could prove me wrong!

Looks like the rpm might be being limited although that would result in a top speed of 20km/h still. Iâ€™m not sure what could be happening but I would suggest changing the gear ratio to gain more speed. 

If you swap the 16t motor pulley with a 24t one that will still have good torque and should have a top speed of about 25km/h

Also what batteries are you using?

I would say that the motor might be a bit lower kV than stated, and Iâ€™m not surprised about the insane torque. If you could take a photo of the pulley and belt for me that would be great, but my guess is that itâ€™s a HTD 3m belt so you should be able to get a new pulley off eBay, although then you may also need a new belt as it might be too short if you canâ€™t adjust the mount

Ok tell me if you want to see something else, i can adjust the motor placement so no need to get a longer one. I used chinese motor pulley kit with 16 teeth on the motor and 48 on the wheels.![IMG_20180617_133438|374x499](upload://babfb5QXF0MWKkE8bu6xMCmcuLg.jpg)![IMG_20180617_133442|374x499](upload://eZQHn5MILAW8prTpICtfGx0s6TW.jpg)![IMG_20180617_133424|374x499](upload://gqqqvSf1C0bolZ1FW12txLdAnRe.jpg)![IMG_20180617_133455|374x499](upload://jv0cEa6XMI9zTFH5q7HdQ8r4IiZ.jpg)

Ahhh yes perfect, you can easily upgrade the pulleys to 24t one that will lower your gear ratio and give you a higher top speed. Itâ€™s exactly what I did on my single drive with that same kit.

Hey, has anyone measured how many Amps this dual board uses max, under load and also while just cruising?
Want to know if i will be stressing cells too much or not if i use 7s2p and 10A cells, that would then be 20A due to 2p. (Panasonic NCR18650PF 2900mAh - 10A)
No guesses or going by the stuff chinese claim on their listing, interested in measured numbers :slight_smile: 
Will be pairing it with 90mm dual hub motors.

Please don't use those cells... 20A is too low, especially for two motors... Dual motor esc's continuous electricity is 50A and 120A peak so you could use the vtc5 (2p) or something like that

Also, It performs the best at 10S

i use 10s lipos with 5000mah and 20C so thats 100A max

If you are using 10s (37v nominal) at 50A continuous then this adds up to controller pushing out 1850watts continuous and with 120A peaks - 4440watts peak, even more when fully charged (2100w-5000w).
This dual controller is listed to manage 150-350w per motor and some sellers claiming 1000w. (combined probably) That would mean 1000 / 26 = 38A max.. and if 350w is actually it's top then this times two is 700 / 26 = 27A, with 7S, hmm.

When have you seen chinese under promising and over delivering on capabilities?
Where did you get your numbers, did you measure that much? Are you using the same controller that the topic is about? @DjamboBuksne
(also motors i ordered claim to be 550w, not sure if total or per motor, if per then 1100w max and they probably oversell - https://www.ebay.com/itm/392078679858 )

Okay guys, I made the test now. This board draws 20 amps. Usually Chinese controllers are limiting power by amps so depending on your battery series configuration it will have different wattage.
I have 7s battery so 3.7x7x20a means i'm pushing 500watts through.
If you run 10s that would do, i guess, ~750 watts.
Here's a test clip, ran the main powerline using thick copper out of the box to measure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4EUbvC8s6o

This means, with my 2p configuration each cell gets max load of ~10 amps.
I went with Sanyo UR18650NSX 2500mAh - 20A instead of Samsung INR18650-30Q 3000mAh - 15A. Why? because tests are showing that sanyos get way less hot under 15A load. The cycle info is bit confusing but overwall I think I have safer setup that should last longer with a bit less capacity. Oh and those happened to be cheaper too

Hi,

I had one for single belt motor and later i got one for dual.
They both were crap.
The single motor one came broken and then I fixed it after couple of months.
One resistor wasn't soldered propertly...
The other one was okay for about a week. then it started acting strange...
While accelerating, when I hit a small bump, It's like the board looses all of it's power.
It's alot slower and brakes are like 80% weaker...
Then I had to stop the board, restart it and again.
Now, after a month or so, It died.

So guys don't waste your money on these...

I agree with @pat.speed, If you just got a faulty unit that didnt perform it's basic functions then take it up with the seller to replace/refund. That is not a good basis to tell everyone not to buy one when you can clearly read about many using it successfully.
The break thing is the big annoyance and that is something any buyer should be aware of. If you use brakes after you get up to speed - prepare to fall if you didnt prep for braking specially and/or isnt very skilled.

We need someone to look into the uart thing that @niuva pointed out, is there any way to dump/modify the firmware or if anyone could get their hands on the firmware that we could upload ourselves..

You must be talking about something else, this topic, as you can see from pictures when you scroll back or start from beginning, is about single board with no pin connecting pcb's. Like the one I also bought: https://www.ebay.com/itm/152989212995

I had the previous version. This update was very good!

[Link](https://www.banggood.com/Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-Controller-With-Remote-Dual-Motors-ESC-Substitute-p-1202299.html?utm_campaign=12146272_1357971&utm_content=2863&p=ZD100112146272201707&ID=44705&cur_warehouse=CN)

There have been improvements in the quality of the construction and also in the performance. The final speed is still 20km / h, but I think it's because I'm using 6s batteries.

The initial acceleration is VERY STRONG! Much stronger than in the old model. Now the remote control is more ergonomic and has 4 speeds.

I'm using engines on the wheels (hub motors).

Other improvements are: protective case, antenna, battery meter, automatic turn on the wheels and power button with led.

Ps .: By default the bridges are weldless, that is, configured for 10s. See the third photo of how the bridge was used to use 6s.

To bind with the controller just press the power skate button for a few seconds. Once the flashing starts flashing, turn on the remote control and with a very fine one-click key on the inner button inside a hole. Then the power button will stop blinking.

[/quote]

Sorry for the late reply, I tried using the hall sensor cables when I had the 6S configuration and barely noticed any difference. It braked better thats for sure (it knew were the motors where). Then I changed it back to no hall sensors cables connected but I cant remember why. Now I am using it with the hall sensor cables disconnected I think its better since I have less cables connected so less risk of a cable disconnecting and making the board behave unpredictably.

Does the 1350 max watt mean that the esc can only handle a motor rated 1350w or less? Or does it mean the esc can only put out 1350w even if you use let's say 2000w rated motor? Cause I got keda 6364 2000 w motor on sale for 25$ on black Friday and I just ordered the esc substitute thinking the esc won't put out more than max Watts and therefore I'm safe with 9s battery 2000w motor and 10s esc substitute.

Have a look around for the erpm of the ESC substitute. Then find the speed calculator that people are using at the moment. Plug in your numbers into the calc and see what your erpm would be for max speed for your battery and motor.
I think you'll find the erpm limit of the ESC substitute is lower than your system could otherwise reach. 
I don't know about any watt limits on it. 
The esc substitute is great for starting with imo. The lower speed settings have a slightly lag on acc and breaking but when you've got your confidence up you'll move up the speed settings and the lags is much reduced. 
Enjoy!

I read on one ebay esc substitute that it limits the motor to 3500rpm. And it specifically limits the speed to 22mph 35km per hour. That makes sense because the older 1.5 meepo used the esc substitute and is limited to 22mph on high setting. I'm completely satisfied with 22mph. All I'm worried about is someone said that the esc can't handle more than 1350w which I have a 2000w motor and 9s battery which the motor can run at 1800w on, but I think the esc won't burn, it will simply cap out at 1350w. The esc substitute I bought is 10s so battery voltage shouldn't be too much. Might have to get a heat sink too so it don't overheat too much.

Sounds like you're on the right track.

Don't forget speed over ground is also determined by your gearing (if belt driven), not just rpm. 

The esc will beep and cut off when the battery gets low. That is determined by battery voltage. If you're starting at 9S on an esc that expects 10S you'll have limited range. 

Mine is super budget set up. 240kv Hobby King sk3 motor. 6S lipos. Belt driven. I don't know about wattage, I've not been concerned by Watts, only revs. 

Its comes with a heat sink (a block of aluminium). I've been riding for a year without a heatsink. A finned heatsink would be better. 

Best is to suck it and see. Go gently, stop and check things often. You'll be fine ;)

Honestly just get a cheap flipsky vesc copy. It will give you far more customisation and to be honest they are more reliable than these cheap things. Between two people I know 6 of the previous releases that have died.

I forgot about the voltage cutoff. So for the battery might wire up another 1s cell. They have individual cells on hobbyking with same configuration as the batteries I have. Just gotta wire up in series, and I'm using BMS so charging will be easy, no need to disconnect batteries. They will all charge at once through bms. 
As for gearing I have 15t motor 35t wheel pulley, and 97mm wheels. Should have a 45km/h 30mph potential. But with 3500rpm engine limit I'm not sure what final speed will be.

I had a 125Kv motor and my board was geared to 40km/h.

I'm sure the esc is current limited so you get lower power if you use a lower voltage.

I should also get a cheap flipsky vesc.

I ordered the single 10s belt driven from dicky and was worried that this esc wont allow me to get faster than 30kph.

it seems that you are limited to 4500ish rpm from motor so you gotta gear way higher. My motor will run at 6400 max rpm at 9s. Which coincidentally is the rpm limit of the esc. With 15T &amp; 35T pulleys, and 97mm wheels should go around 49.58km/h!! I guess the 97mm wheels make a huge difference in final speed. Ill be getting all my stuff shipped in, in a month so will see once i build it if its really gonna go 50kph lol the calculator results from my setup: [http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":1,"batt-cells":9,"motor-kv":190,"system-efficiency":90,"motor-pulley-teeth":15,"wheel-pulley-teeth":35,"wheel-size":97}|](http://calc.esk8.it/#%7B%22batt-type-lipo%22:1,%22batt-cells%22:9,%22motor-kv%22:190,%22system-efficiency%22:90,%22motor-pulley-teeth%22:15,%22wheel-pulley-teeth%22:35,%22wheel-size%22:97%7D%7C)

But you will use a 9S battery?

Use a 10S battery, the esc has a cutoff voltage and using a 9S battery will reach that cutoff voltage much quicker, it's really meant to be used with a 10S battery

Higher kv is possible but this won't increase the topspeed anymore.

yeah i already got my 3s x3 battery so 9s. it was dirt cheap on black friday sale on hobbyking. 
I was thinking to buy an extra single battery cell as they sell them on hobbyking. and wire it up in series for total of 10s, then use bms to charge all batteries at once. 

thats way i could avoid the esc cutoff. 
im working on a low budget for now as you can see.

Did this esc really did a cut off? I think mine was just beeping when voltage per cell was around 3.4v... not sure I got to point where it just stops..

As about beeping noise, you can just remove the beeper, if u dont like the sound
Also.. not sure how it works when u set it to 7s, for example, and then run with 9s battery

7s would be underpowered. And maybe too much voltage at 9s for the 7s circuit to handle?
I think 9s will simply give me like 10% less range because its 10% less voltage at 9s than 10s. 
3v per cell it shuts down the esc as pat.speed said. 
But again im gonna wire up an extra 1s 5000mah 20c cell. they go for 8$ on hobbyking and match my (3s 5000mah 20c)x3 Batteries. 
Its gonna charge through bms so the charging will be though one port, that way having 4 seperate batteries isn't an issue. 
In the end i think its worth getting the 3 3s batteries because they were dirt cheap on black friday sale. getting a single 10s would cost me x4 more money.

Okey I hope you're right with the lipo batteries :wink:

 10S version has a undervoltage protection of 3V so that means the battery shuts off at 30V, this also includes the battery sag, so you won't drain the battery to 30V, your battery will be more like 34V after fully draining the battery.

Using a 9S battery will cut off at 30V, so around 3,35V per cell. Same story with voltage sag so your battery will be around 37V after fully draining it.

I should not say the 9S has 10% less range than the 10S battery but you can try it.
```

## \#410 Posted by: ElectricHabitatLeaf Posted at: 2019-03-12T15:00:21.517Z Reads: 97

Yeah you're right.
So fully charged lipo cell should be close to 4.2V. Cutoff will be at 3.33v  
3v is the 10s cutoff. Difference between 10s and 9s is 3.33v - 3 = 0.33
Our range from 4.2v to 3.0V is 1.2v 
1.2v is 100% of the voltage we can use at 10s. 
0.33/1.2 = 0.275 x 100 = 27.5% 

Voltage cutoff will happen 27.5% sooner at 9s than 10s. 

According to 3dvervisas esk8 calculator, my estimated range is: 13.88km on 9s
battery will cutoff 27.5% sooner because the esc tuned for 10s.
13.88km*0.275= 3.817km
13.88-3.817= 10.06km

if my grade 3 calculations are right
My range should be 3.8km shorter
10km instead of 13.9

well for a first build 10km is ok but i will probably want to upgrade in the future.

@djalmaribeiro @jeepee_12  I believe I have the same esc. How do I pair the remote? I couldn't find any instructions online. I tried pressing the code synchronize button on the esc and it will beep alot but not pair. I also tried pressing the little button on the remote in the bottom right corner (see 2nd pic), and the power light will flash on the remote but nothing happens.

Hi,
I also stuggled to bind the remote control but I found those instruction on AliExpress (I know it is not exactly the same ESC and remote control but it worked for me). First I tried to press the little button on the ESC but you have to press the little button on your remote controll. You have to take quite a long stick to reach the button, I used a allen key. Good luck ;)![Remote%20control%20Binding|690x483](upload://4H03VJGIzIFIRNzv77dcsjBVYBV.jpeg) !

@jeepee_12 hm, I think it has paired since when I press the throttle down to brake i can see the hub fidgeting like its trying to do something. However, my battery indicator is showing 1 red bar despite having a fully charged 6s battery attached to it. 

I checked all 6 of the motor leads coming out of the esc, and all of them have continuity with the negative pole on the xt60 battery connector... is this normal? On my other board some of the phase wires are connected to positive.

That sounds like the ESC is programmed for 10S and not 6S, so that's most likely why you're experiencing that issue.

These Chinese ESCs typically support 6S, 7S and 10S, and there are a couple points on the board that determine which mode its in, depending on how they are soldered.

Maybe @dickyho can help us with the instructions on how to change it?

Ya, it said it is defaulted to 6s when shipped. Although right now there is just a large white insulating blob on the area where the 6s and 7s bridges are so I'm a little bit suspicion of this. Here is what it looks like:
![20190316_125611|374x499](upload://pfPMYOsL7gF1OOtF7XZdd3OlrUo.jpeg) 

Would it be safe to use 12S on this to check? Or could it break stuff?

Hey, i have one of those ESC too, works fine for me in 10S. Mine shipped as 10s as default. I dont think it supports 12S though, i reckon it will likley break, im still a noob at this but hopefully others can verify for you.

If you want it to go into 10S mode you have to desolder the connection points labled 6s, and 7s (near the white blob holding the atenna). Mine shipped as 10s as default

Definitely do not try 12S. None of these are made to handle 12S. I said it was a 10S default, but it's possible it could also be 7S. Either way, I have a feeling that's the issue here. All it is is a solder bridge making the difference, so maybe they forgot to do that before shipping.

Let me try to find some documentation on this, unless dicky has an answer for us first.

The v1 version of the esc can handle 12s but above 50v there will will be no brake's (12s max voltage is 50.4..., so just drain the battery below 50v and you will have brakes which is easy to do.)

V2 the person that you have can't handle 12s because of the 50v components compared to the v1 63v components

Mine is an earlier version, but should be the same idea. You can see here the pads that say 6S and 7S. Mine is a 10S, so that's why nothing is connected. If you want 6S, you need to use solder to bridge (content) the two pads beside 6S. You can remove the white blob. Just scrape away at it gently with an knife or something. It's probably just there to hold the antenna in place. You can add hot glue later if you're worried it will come loose.

Ok, I think I paired the remote successfully. I bridged the 6s tabs and now the battery is showing 2 red bars instead of flashing 1. 

Good news, one of the hubs is now working. But the other is not doing anything? Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this?

Hey ive got a question. Ive got this board with this same esc and 2 3s batteries with a belt driven motors all bought off ebay. It worked awesome for quite some time. I plugged it in to charge it and then i went to ride it again, it wouldnt do anything. The brakes would work, but it wouldnt accelerate. I found that if i push started it, it would go but it was glitching a lot. Like the esc was bad. I replaced the esc with the same model, and it didnt do anything. I replaced the motors thinking it would solve my problem. Still nothing. The only origiinal part is the battery. Do you have any idea whats happening?

Hard to tell. My first guess would be esc but since u already replaced it and it still glitches it might be something else.

Though in your place I would try with 3rd esc just not sure where u can get one without buying new one.

I have one of those dual versions you see on the first posts of this thread. Anyone know if i can wire both sides parallel into one motor? I think it doesn't give all the power available.

I have used it before with 10S and two motors, but now i need to install it on 6S with one motor.

I remember that 10S setting is no solder bridges, and 6S is just one bridge to label "6S". Right?

Hi guys. First post here. Awesome site, and a great community! Ive lurked for a while, and thanks for everything ive already learned.

Im in the process of planning my first build, and have the dual esc which i intend to use.
Ive seen discussions about battery displays, some opting for momentary switches etc so as to not have a constant battery drain, others suggesting to tap into the battery live and ground after the boards e-switch (waaaay beyond my capabilities)
Ive had a thought, and im hoping someone much smarter than me can give their thoughts before i start a fire or blow something up ;)

I intend to use the +5v signal that powers the switch's led, to trip the gate of a mosfet, acting as a secondary e-switch, controlling my lights and battery display. Any time the board is powered on, the gate goes positive, allowing current flow to the lights and battery display. When the board is switched off, a pull-down resistor between the gate and ground, takes it back to 0v, and switches them off too.

It seems so simple, that i wouldve thought someone would already have gone that route, unless theres some factor im missing, or misunderstanding? Any input from anybody would be greatly appreciated.

Hi 

I have already ordered this kind of ESC for a project where I asked the factory to change the AMP and the acceleration slope (normally this ESC is limited to 8 or 10Amp, but you can have 15A or 20Amp normally). 

I would like to know if somebody know how to change the firmware or to hack this ESC to change the program inside the microprocessor ? I would like to create my own acceleration profile and running mode ;) - Maybe a gitlab project exists ? 

Thanks for your feedback 

Fred
