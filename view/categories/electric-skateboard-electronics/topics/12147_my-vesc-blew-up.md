Hi,

One month ago I built my first electric skateboard. Decided to change my ESC for a VESC. After trying to run it in FOC mode the motor started jittering at startup. So I put it back in BLDC mode. Pulled the trigger. And BAM. Big spark from my DRV8302. See the pictures for the burned spots on my VESC. What went wrong? Is it my fault by setting some wrong parameters? Or is it just a faulty VESC? I assume this is not repairable, so what do I have to do so this does not happen again if I buy a new VESC?
It is a 12s setup with a 230kv. 
Greetings,
Luc

sounds like a typical fault due to the FOC-BLDC switching. Sorry to say but that is on you.
FOC is not recommended with the current VESC version.

Why is it not possible to put this VESC in FOC mode? And if I buy a new VESC and keep it in BLDC mode everything should be fine?

Lots of blow ups seem to happen in FOC mode and 12s. No idea why people try it anyway and then wonder when things go wrong?

Are there warnings on that go wth the vecs about not to go into FOC. I thought some ppl did have vescs in foc or is it with certain battery set ups.

When you switch between FOC and BLDC, you should reupload the firmware, otherwise bad things can happen.

Well a bit foolish of me. But if I knew I should not be running FOC mode with 12s I would not have done it.

esk8.de says this on their website:
"WARNING: FOC is still in deveolpment, therefor we recommend using the VESC in BLDC mode only! Using FOC happens on your own responsibility and risk!"

1. 12s is sometimes critical for vesc. 10s is recommended 
2. Foc is not stable with our current version
3. Switching back to bdlc causes problems without a proper reset
4. 12s 230kv is a bad combo for vesc

that is what they claim - not specifically though as they just say it is more robust in general.

Look at some reviews, perhaps someone tested it with 12s and foc. But your motor is still to high.

Well it is hard to find proper reviews of the VESC-X since it is not officially released yet. They claim it is 12s compatible, so it should be fine. But what is wrong with a 230kv motor?

Thank you all for answering my questions.
Well I first started out with a complete kit from  which included a 12s torqueboards ESC and a 230kv motor. But then I wanted something more programmable. And blindly assumed that a VESC would fit my needs. But lesson learned, I need to do better research next time.

 I feel your pain brother.  I just learned this five days ago. I stumbled across this forum  because I couldn't get any response from Tb.  I didn't even ask them to pay for it I just wanted to know was it something I did  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/b/0b99579653649aabb462f5519c55ae03fde27a86.jpg" width="373" height="500">

So, I don't know if I'm the only one that noticed...but your screenshot of settings shows your battery cutoff start and end at 36V and 33V respectively. Those are good settings, for a 10s setup. But if you're running 12s it should be 43.2V start cutoff and 42V end cutoff. 

I actually have been running the TB VESC and 230KV on my board for over a month. Over 200 problem free miles so far.

You can run 12s in FOC. I have 8 VESC 4.12s in FOC at 12s, hummie runs at 12s in FOC, and same with chaka with chaka vescs.

What you can't do is run 12s FOC with a standard enertion VESC and not expect problems...

I have also switched between FOC to BDLC and back to FOC before with no issues... It's where you choose to buy your vesc from that determines what you can do with it...

I hope the vesc-x fixes these issues. I will let you know when I beta test one if you can run 12s in FOC, since that's pretty much the only way I run...

you can't even run 10S in FOC with Enerton-VESCs but they are cheap: 1 Enertion Vesc + 1 DRV-Repair is still cheaper than 1 Chaka or 1 esk8.de-Vesc which can blow up too

waiting for VESC-X

[/quote]

I've had no issues with enertion vescs on foc at 10s. I believe that a big factor of this is hitting the erpm limit that chaka talks about. 10s and 190kv motors seem to work fine for me but I wouldn't expect 10s and 230kv motors. I'm sure manufacturing quality helps prevent issues with soldering etc.

I was using 190kv, you may get lucky or you may not, it's a gamble as nobody really understands what exatly happens and that's why you are never be save to use FOC.

BLDC will be completely reliable though?

Does anyone have input on the % torque gain from FOC, and the %noise reduction from FOC?

 I definitely would not try it with TBs vest.( again )
 They will not contact you back .
 But my Enetion vest on 9s 149kv  has ran flawlessly for a couple months but I probably won't change out of it. üê•üê•üê•üê•

Could you clarify what the "proper reset" procedure is for this?  I want to try FOC (on 8-10s), and if it's not awesome i'll switch back to BLDC.  Curious on the specific steps to do this safely to avoid killing the VESC or DRV chip.

I'm running 12S foc on my board on 2 focboxes, and I haven't had any issues yet.  Full no-load spin up only brings me to about 54k erpm. This is with 190kv tb motors, sensored.

No amount of "I did it and I'm fine" will get me to risk my body.  All those parts have manufacturing tolerances of like 10% for every single piece.  Running it a the razor-edge of what's possible, maybe, is not on my agenda for something that can throw me on the roadway at speed if it fails.  You can do it all you want.  But please don't act like it's not dangerous.

Almost all my boards are 12s, all working perfect. More voltage less current flowing through all the components, everything works cooler, the acceleration is impressive every time o push it to the limit. 
Focboxes working like a clock, VESC6 also working reliably. 
I think the respect/fear for 12s is overrated

I had one of those TB Vesc's blown up on me too. I was trying to do UART communication with Arduino and after using BLDC to manually set current it turned into a firework. :fireworks: :disappointed_relieved: I then talked to DIY and they sent me a full replacement for $80 free shipping and I didn't even have warrenty on the one I blew up. :grinning:

@luckleineschaars It sounds like you may have incorrectly configured a setting during FOC setup. I was testing a 4.12 the other day and figured I'd see what would happen if I tried to spin a big motor at 15000 RPM and blew it up pretty similar to this. However, this is repairable and I can repair it for you. I run a repair service for VESCs out of Florida. Let me know if you're interested

JK this was over a year ago :joy:
