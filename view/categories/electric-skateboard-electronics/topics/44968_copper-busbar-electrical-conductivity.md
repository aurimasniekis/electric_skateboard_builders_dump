Hey!

I‚Äôm currently planning a batterybuild where I‚Äôll use a ‚ÄùChaka-style‚Äù cell level fusing(https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/fishpaper-and-cell-level-fusing-use-it/35026)

But instead of a brass busbar I‚Äôll probably use a copper one, and I stumbled across a copper sheet which looks good. But on the product info the electrical conductivity is measured in ohm/mm2. 

Does anyone have any input on if this is a good sheet to use for this application? The product info states 0,024ohm/mm2 @ 50 degrees celsius.

I‚Äôm guessing it will still be way better than nickel but hey, maybe there‚Äôs a copper specialist in house :grinning:

Not splitting hairs - copper is the metal of choice for conduction due to its low resistance and other physical properties, thats why you find it everywhere in electronics...

Actually, gold-plated silver is the best conductor known at room temperature.
Silver conducts the best and gold makes the best connections to other things.

can i ask a question here without derailing the thread... 

isn't a certain level of resistance necessary in the metal of choice for bridging P-groups so that balancing occurs more thoroughly between cells on charge and discharge? i know copper is available, and i know that its far more conductive. That's literally what coper is known for and we learn that at a very early age. 

this question is not motivated by giant spool of nickel i have.

Gold is the least conductive of the two, but it makes the best connections to other things.  No electric can flow through it inless it's connected in a circuit.  So silver in the middle and gold plating works best :stuck_out_tongue:

According to some hasty Google-fu, 0.5mm copper has a resistance of 0.000847 ohms/square. For a 10mm wide, 50mm long strip, that would be 5 squares, or 0.000847*5=0.004235 ohms end to end.

Ideally you want the least resistance because any resistance would mean a voltage differential which would mean uneven discharge and/or balancing. At least that's what makes sense to me.

Interested as my understanding was the charge applied related to voltage and that the charging happens at such low amps that you don't in fact need anything fancy for parallel wiring, on series is important, other than that I have seen packs with a parallel bussbar on the parallel terminating strip as all the series current flows through each cell

great video.

I was supposed to get some silver solder from hobbyking I think but it never came but now thinking using 100% silver sounds like a good idea anyone done it? the big plus being if it's easier to work with.   haven't watched that complete video either yet.  so many shows to watch.  it'd be reusable.  recycle your silver.  I don't have any. 

about the cell's p connections with increased resistance it sounds nice for when you first put all the cells in p together so there would be no initial current rush other than that when charging or discharging I think there will be such a low current going across the p connection a highly conductive connection wouldn't be bad for the cell.  But if you have a bum cell in the p group I wonder how much is lost in its p connection if the resistance were high there.  what happens with a complete dud in the p group?  maybe if you have high resistance p connections and you do have a dud it will heat up more and you could tell by touching.  THAT would be pretty awesome in its ability to tell a dud cell.  It's unlikely a whole p group is messed up of course and it's just likely a single cell in there  and the p connection could give it away

I don't know what you mean by the cell not holding a charge above a certain voltage and I was thinking of what I see as the typical scenario where you have a weaker cell that hits 4.2 first when charging and also gets down to 3.0 first when discharging.   if this weak cell is in a p group I don't think it will do almost any balancing because of its capacity but it would do some extreme balancing if this "weak" cell is less able to discharge without sagging.  if it sags then there would be voltage imbalance between the p cells and then the balance connection would get warm maybe.
these are guesses and hoping someone call tell how it goes

Bad cells, with high internal resistance will not charge to 4.2, progressively they will peak at a lower voltage and once charging ends it will continue to convert energy to heat, dropping voltage, if there are are other cells with it in the p group they will also drain

Was the cell identical to the others to begin with? Cells don't get weak per se they build up internal resistance. 
If you start with 4 new 30q cells in a P group, assuming they are IR matched, there shouldn't be any deviation between them. There can be a deviation and increased internal resistance in one or some cells if they aren't charged discharged evenly, bad welds or something like that

I've only ever ridden with lipo so maybe they don't stay as balanced but whatever the reason there's always a cell or two that will go up and down faster than the others.  
@sash the cells in p will all be the same voltage regardless at all times I think or only a hair off from each other, so small that the resistance of the p connection wouldn't matter in normal operation.   With a really weak cell I think this would still be the case when discharging or charing and only if "weak" means inability to discharge as well as the others, then that voltage sag will put a voltage difference between the p group.

Yes, cells in the same P group always have the same voltages regardless (under normal or abnormal operation, with or without weak cells, with or without voltage sag, etc).   Voltage is the difference of potentials.  All plusses in the P group have the same potential and all minuses have the same potentials, so the cells have the same voltages.   

They can only have different voltages if the battery has cell level fusing and  a fuse blows.

ok so even voltage sag wouldn't be a time when the balance connections are passing much current.  

and is that how cell level fusing works..it breaks the circuit when the p group cells become imbalanced?  never looked at it.

My understanding is that cell level fusing prevents thermal runaway due to internal shorting. If a cell were to short itself, the other cells in the P group would normally dump a bunch of current into the bad cell and cause runaway. Cell level fusing cuts the bad cell off from the P group when that happens. I guess it's not really if the cells become imbalanced in general but like if a cell were to fail enough to cause a massive inrush of current.
```

## \#43 Posted by: sash Posted at: 2018-01-30T06:23:38.840Z Reads: 72

```
The way how I understand cell level fusing is that a fuse blows if too much current goes though a cell.  This can happen if there is an internal short in a cell, then all the current starts going through that cell in its fuse blows which disconnects the cell from the loop and saves other cells.
```

## \#44 Posted by: sash Posted at: 2018-01-30T06:34:50.044Z Reads: 72

```
... Also if there is a short between main terminals of the battery then, I think, the following should happen:    The currents through all cells will be very high and there will be one fuse which blows first.  This will automatically increase the currents through other cells in the same P block, so their fuses will also blow.   So basically all fuses in (at least) one P block will blow, and the battery will be saved.

To really clarify: using more conductive than nickel is a benefit for the pack on all series connections for sure but on parallel connections it MAY be better to use high resistance stuff.  
 @sash can u or someone tell me are the cell level fuses also the parallel connections?  So in a situation where one cell in a p group were to internally short I guess it's voltage will drop way low and then the rest of the p group cells would try to balance it as always but now with a lot of current through the p balance connection and if that's thin it will burn up n disconnect the single bad cell from its p connection and prevent the other p cells from dumping into it.  The one bad cell is already a goner and the benefit being decreasing heat in the cells beside it with the hope that one hot cell isbt enough to go to thermal runaway and it needs a couple. 
. A cell level fuse just being a very high resistance connection. Is this right?  I see the cell level fuse thread but its big n hoping someone can summarize grabbing the nuggets n kernels.

@Hummie  I think that you are basically right.  But I don't want to pretend that I am expert on cell level fusing.  I've read through several long threads about it and considering to use it in my next battery build, but I am not sure yet.

Currently, I don't use any fuses in my esk8, because I don't want a fuse to blow on me when I am riding.   I thought that cell level fusing is a safer option, because if one fuse blows you can still ride your board.

My impression is that it has not been widely tested yet.  For example, which fuse wire to use?  If it is too thin then fuses will blow when you don't want them to blow, if it is too thick then fusing defeats its purpose and will not save a battery from thermal runaway.  

@chaka says to use 22 - 24 awg wire
@jinra says that 22 awg fuses were blowing for him and suggests 18 - 20 awg

It also depends a lot on the design of the pack, on the length of fuse wires, on the material and weight of busbars, on the amount of open space around fuses, etc.

Basically, the only way to figure it out is to try and find out what works for you.

I need to build a 10S4P battery in two layers.  It looks that so far only @michaelcpg has managed to build a 2 layered battery with fusing.  So this is really a new territory.

Tesla uses cell level fusing, but it is a different story.  In cars they have huge numbers of cells in P groups.   So their batteries can produce high currents even if fuse wires are thin.  Several blown fuses should not make much difference. 

In esk8, where people typically use 4P or 3P setups, it is much more sensitive to the gauge of fuse wires, etc.  So I am not convinced about cell level fusing.

I think that a fuse wire is "a less conductive material".  The whole point is that it is less conductive, and if the current is too high it heats up and blows.  Other than fuse wires I also don't see a point in using less conductive material.

Now for series connections you need to use conductive material to produce the current you need from your battery without heating the connections.  For parallel connections you don't really need very conductive material because there is not much current going through these connections.  (Ideally, if the cells are identical to each other, where should not be any current going through parallel connections.)    So you can use less conductive material for parallel connections.   But the only benefit of it is saving a couple of dollars on your nickel strips.

@jinra Thanks for the clarification.

One question is bugging me.   @chaka says to put fuses on positive ends of cells.   In the design that I have in mind, I want to put fuses on pluses and minuses in an alternating way.  I am can eliminate any possibility of shorts.  (Planning to separate fuses from cell by fiberglass plates.)

Is there any electrical reason why I should not do this?  (Uneven current distributions, or something like this?)

18 awg being thicker than 20. 
But...if cell level fusing IS simply a very thin parallel connection and done in a board as apposed to a Tesla, and a cell were to out-of-nowhere short, and then its p neighbors would not just be balancing but shorting as well, (mistaken in what I wrote about above and it would be shorting all the p cells if one cell were to short).
   Makes sense to have a thin enough p connection that it would break the circuit so as not to continue shorting the other three cells but how often does a cell short out of nowhere anyway and more so I thought the large majority of fires were due to a cell being charged that was damaged and in that instance does it ever even short in the cell before or even after thermal runaway has started?  The fuses maybe only are good for a rare instance of a cell internally shorting.  Is that rare or the norm for a lead-up to runaway?

Is there any difference between fusing both ends or only one end of a cell?   I mean, it is enough to interrupt electrical current only in one point, right?   But in youtube videos about cell level fusing, they usually fuse both ends.

Fusing both ends would be the same as putting two fuses in a series connection.  It should not add anything.   Actually, I think it might be even worse than fusing one end because it would increase the probability of accidental blown fuse (due to a defective fuse, bad soldering, vibration, etc).  Am I missing anything?

I was asking the following:   I want to fuse only one end of cells, but I want to put in on plusses for one half of all cells and on minuses for the other half of the cells.   Is there any reason why it can be bad?
```

Why would the neighbour p short? The cells are only connected to eachother with the fuse. When the cell draws too much A (be it from a short or a bad cell from over discharge) the fuse will melt and seperate the cell from the group. The rest of the group remains intact.

Edit: The rest or the remaining group would not short but will draw a higher current.

I was meaning that when the one cell has an internal short the other cells beside it in the same p will also be shorting through it until the fuse breaks the connection. A safety feature which makes sense only when shorting happens in a cell but when does shorting happen in a cell?

[/quote]

i have all the same questions. 

my thoughts were that the fuses allow a gentle overload cascade to happen that will eventually burn up all the cell fuses in the p group, disabling the pack, and i have to assume burning up the balance lead as well if the BMS doesn't sense some dumb shit happening and switch off. 

so then what... you replace the cells?

so after reading this whole thread repeatedly while trying to take the occasional break in order to draw pictures of urinating esk8ers, i was lead to the conclusion that having cell "go dud" inside a welded p-group was somehow super-bad-time, either the cell would drag everything down with it and not accuratelty balance things any more, or something worse like extra heat ...

except i've never seen any of this happen and i've had every kind of bad battery come across my bench conceivable. I'm not saying i've seen everything, i must assume that i have not. but i have seen packs with far less than adequate cells sitting in the middle of a 4P group doing nothing but mildly affecting range and full charge voltage.

I am also trying to decide if cell level fusing worths extra efforts needed to build a pack (and also maintain it, replace fuse wires, etc.).

In the known cases of thermal runaway, would cell level fusing have prevented it?     If one cell goes on fire, then I guess the whole pack will :bomb::boom: even if all fuses burn.

Does "internal shorting in a cell" happen to anyone?


But I am definitely going to do this:

If you do not want to go through the trouble of fusing a pack at the very least you should be isolating the paralleled cells from the next group of cells with a strip of fishpaper and insulate the edge of the positive terminal if you are bridging cells with nickle strip.

What's nice with the @chaka method is that he left behind a nice thingiverse design for anyone to adapt it
