It’s really hard to find a good remote. 
I like the photon but hate the joystick throttle. 
I like the firefly diy trigger version and excited for a project but a two month wait for most of the parts to the USA. I imagine the firefly is the same. This was going to be my pick.
I am not a fan of the simple remotes out there. I don’t necessarily need the telemetry. Maybe I’ll try the hobby king gt2b in the 3d printed case. 
I’m not sure what else is out there. I was possibly thinking maytech but the trigger reminded me of the cheap old Meepo style trigger. Which I hate. Idk what am I missing?  Is there something else out there or coming to the market soon?

Benchwheel if you like thumb wheels and maytech sex toy (to quote lhb) if you like thumb trigger.  Neither of mine have had any issues at all and have the throttle range I like.  Can't stand the nano clones out there because the throttle feels like an on off switch.  Gt2b if you like finger triggers.  Oh and if something goes wrong with the gt every rc hobby store has them and the receivers etc.

Interesting that some people don't seem to have any issues with them. The places I got dropouts were pretty consistent (could never figure out what exactly was interfering with the signal though), usually happening in the same spots each day on my commute, although not always the case...

They are designed for the rc world.  Been around for ages and cross connections during a race etc just can't happen so a lot more effort has been put in to safeguard that.  I'm sure that someone will chime in with the tech deets though but I use gt remotes in most of my cars and one build without an issue too.  Just not keen on the finger trigger for esk8 and if its not broke don't fix it really.

Nothing seems to bother mine in every application even carbon enclosures.  Group rides etc.  Its tough as nails and lasts too long tbh Keep forgetting to charge it and even when it dies on you it gives you a ten minute reprieve to get home on.  Lost connection like that a couple of times and it just gently brakes the board to a stop.  Maybe you just were victim to the old chinese QA  check 1 in 500 and all good.  Hope I'm not the exception because I've been singing its praises for a while now.  :open_mouth:

thumb remotes are out of the question for me, so it's exclusively the mini.

but lacking trigger discipline could cause problems since it's exposed and could pull in throttle by mistake.

been caught out multiple times accidentally triggering the throttle and board flying away.  last time it happened it was a $400 mistake.

I really like my evolve remote, and all the information on a color screen. Never had a dropout. Big problem is the proprietary nature of evolve -- I am ditching everything from the esc down to move on to a 12s focbox unity here in a little while. But i agree with the post, someone should make a great remote, this is the part of the skateboard someone touches. Think like apple -- that is where you put in the extra effort.

Most remotes that use a normal RF or Bluetooth receiver connected straight to the UART port will be doomed to have dropout issues.

The problem is there is no data processing on the board side (although this is doable with custom firmware, but not done yet AFAIK)

There are federal and international limits on RF and Bluetooth powered devices. This is to prevent escalation wars between different devices getting higher and higher power transmitters over years in an attempt for manufacturers to crowd out other devices or just to maintain range and keep up with other overpowered devices.

So, given these restrictions, there is a hard limit. your transmitter cannot be above a certain wattage. RF instead of HM10 modules will do better due to better inherent range. But this won't help you if there is an abundance of other devices on the same frequency in the area. 

So, the only solution to this problem is advanced data processing. Your modules aren't smart, they will receive data and throw out bad packets.

With better processing board side, you could ignore certain scenarios. For example, let's say your board starts losing packets near a traffic light due to lots of noise. Normally, as soon as you lose packets the board will stop providing power or brake upon packet loss.

You can help this kind of scenario with additional processing as a buffer between the receiver and the vesc. Such as certain failiure modes. If the remote dies suddenly you could program it to decrease throttle slowly and increase braking power over time to bring you to a stop. Or, if you only lose a few packets like over the course of an eigth of a second, don't stop giving power or brake so you don't get sporadic reactions in that short amount of packet loss time.

Not only this, but it'd be much easier to send alerts to the remote. A simple continous "ping" sent back to the remote could help alert you stay safe. If it starts to disconnect or lose signal your remote could beep at you if it's not recieving a "live" signal. AFAIK the vesc doesn't have this kind of function for telemetry, you can only pull data from the vesc, which can crowd up the already limited bandwith between the modules.

Remote disconnects will not stop, but the harsh reaction to them can be helped. Just stopping all action is pretty bad if you're accelerating hard or braking.

I dunno. My opinion is that there aren't enough safety features included in most boards. having hard coded "failiure modes" will help tremendously.

I've been mulling this over with regards to safety concerns with unexpected remote dropouts. I wanna implement gradual brakes on a disconnect of more than a couple of seconds. Haven't searched around about it yet but I really want to have that fail safe in place.

I checked the Evolve r2 remote internals (on the interwebs) and it is essentialy just a stm32f microcontroller lcd, nrf and charger, only tricky is the lcd, could not find model info but there are only a few lcd drivers sdd (e.g. SSD1351 ) so if one is good reverse engineering hack it and make it pair a nrf24 receiver ppm module (e.g. solidgeeks)

Your right. This is why the GT2B is so much more reliable as it has frequency hopping and error correction. Its even low end on RC control spectrum. We need the technology from a high end RC controllers for safety. It sux if your $4000 model falls out of the sky and explodes. But is sux more if you street your face or worse. :skateboard: :skull_and_crossbones:

it would actually not that hard to incorporate an frsky transmitter into our remote/board, there are some open sourced RC transmitter projects that can talk anything you like, frsky, dsm, dsmx, flysky,... so build that protocol (and rf module cc2500 instead of a nrf24) into our remote and we can use just any standard frsky receiver module, and use the standard fail-safe features

Hey, I'm new around here and can't make new posts yet, so just going to chime in on other ones...

I love the Evolve R2 remote for the following reasons:

* Ergonomics. I rode someone else's Boosted board and I just didn't like the way the remote felt.
* The brakes work without the deadman switch. Almost crashed on the Boosted board because it stupidly requires the deadman switch for the brakes to work.
* The brakes supersede the acceleration switch. Seems obvious just like the point above.
* The deadman switch is overridden by kick pushing.
* I have never lost connection with over a year of near daily riding.

A part of why I joined this forum is to ask if it's possible to use an official Evolve R2 remote with a DIY board.

That Maytech R2 looks promising if the answer is no.

I wonder how hard it'll be do design a receiver for those meepo style controllers?  (These ones: http://www.diyeboard.com/new-version-4-speed-mode-24ghz-remote-controller-rc6-for-eboard-p-666.html)

These have 4 modes, very solid connection, and very intuitive.  If someone can design these receivers, you'd essentially have really good $20 remotes.

(This is essentially what flipsky VX1 is, but taking advantage of the mass produced cheaper remotes)

Any electronics/electrical engineers that can weigh in on this?

I don't like the mini remote simply because of the power switch. It's too easy to accidentally hit on. Modifying it with a switch cap would be nice.
