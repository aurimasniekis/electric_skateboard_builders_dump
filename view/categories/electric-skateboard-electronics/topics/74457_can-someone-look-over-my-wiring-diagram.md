looks just fine to me. just make sure the balance wires each have the correct voltage so you dont blow your bms. also, connect the main negative FIRST, then the balance leads ðŸ˜Š

Once you get it all wired up, donâ€™t plug in the balance cables until you check with your multimeter that the voltages are in order
