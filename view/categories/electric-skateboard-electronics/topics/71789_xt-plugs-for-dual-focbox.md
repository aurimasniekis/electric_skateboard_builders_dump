Yes it is, but you need 2 female on one side and 1 male on other side, the one you linked is 2 male and 1 female

You could use xt60s on the focbox though no?

Just if space is at a premium. 3 x XT90s can take up a bit of room.

@seaborder 
Just be aware that if you change anything on the focbox then you void your warranty.  Best leave the xt60's on there and use an xt90 s for the battery with a y splitter like @Skunk showed.

Is that a 12S5P setup diagram? That's a pretty good detailed picture.
