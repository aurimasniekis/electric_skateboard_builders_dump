I'm going dual but since I'm using different 2 diff motor, 190 and 260kv, and gear ration is a bit different to compensate as well, 15/36 and 12/36.

I think 2 receiver may be better solution, What do you think?

And another one, Does Traction control helps on loose ground significantly?

I wouldn't call traction control an essential feature, but it does help a bit if you hit sand, or gravel, etc.

split ppm, safest method as i know

I wouldn't run can on different KV motors... Stick to split ppm...

This is coming from a guy who runs sensored FOC over CanBus with traction control exclusively on my personal boards..

That's what I thought. I saw many fired vesc even with experienced builders without any of my problem. Thanks

I fried several VESC's trying to make a CANBUS connection, stupidly without an antispark switch. Been running split ppm since then with no problems. I won't try another CAN connection until I'm more confident in my skillset, and the price of VESC'd comes down a bit more. I split out the ppm signal wire alone, and it works great.

Iâ€™ve always done split ppm or dual receiver. 
Always remove one positive wire from the splitter and you should be all good. 
A lot of people swear by canbus but it seems easier for it to go wrong.

Don't you mean remove one +5v wire?

Doh, yep. that's the one.

Thanks guys, Since I have 5 receivers because the seller sent me 2 times, I will use 2, cuz it's easier

And gives you some backup if parts fail. You can always get home if a vesc, motor or receiver blows. One half should always work.

Is there tutorial how to configure dual focbox split ppm? Thank you in advance for help :slight_smile:

You have three wires of the receiver. 
+5v
Signal
Ground

Solder signal together. 
Solder ground together. 
You have two +5v wires. One on each vesc. 
Cut one +5v wire. You only need to connect one +5v wire to the receiver. 
So in the end you'll have one +5v wire, 2 signal wires and two ground wires connected to the receiver. 

Hope this helps.

Thank you for clarifying that part for me, it is really helpful. I am just starting to assemble my emtb so I have couple of more questions : motor detection and configuration is done on each motor separately? Is there some recommendation regarding the motor and battery settings?

```
Motor detection and detection has to be done separately for each motor. There are a few emtb builds you can copy here on the forum.

Seriously, it seems to me that you only signed up yesterday. No hard feelings.

I've asked this before but I am still not totally understanding how to do this.  Could someone please explain how to set up 4 VESC's for 4WD?  Please if someone could draw a diagram that would be helpful.  I've heard to daisy chain a canbus, I was thinking about connecting 2 VESC together for a front and rear drive, and then connect those via ppm, or just using two receivers for the front and rear, but I've also heard that's bad...  Can I get a DETAILED explanation please???

No reason for had feelings. I just started the assembly and I had difficulty finding the right answers on questions that concerned me :)
