I tried looking up info but haven't really gotten the answer I looked for.
My knowledge about batteries is not the greatest. My uncle helps me a bit with my first build, he claims that VESCs will require a very strong battery to work because they draw a lot of current. It sounded weird to me, I understand that I can use whatever battery and the VESC just controls everything. It doesn't really have demands, does it? I'd appreciate some clarification.

The VESC can only perform in a certain range (6V - 60V?). In this range the VESC itself will manage how much current and voltage goes through to the Motor (VESC BLDC-Setup). It will only get what the battery can deliver.

Your application (single/dual Motor + weight + desired topspeed + desired range) tells you how much Juice your battery will Need.
If your battery is too weak you will harm your battery or wont drive as fast / Long as you want.
So better overbuild the battery to get what you want.

Thanks for the reply mate. That's what I thought. The VESC manages the current and get what the battery can deliver. My uncle sort of thinks the VESC got this requirement, as if feeding it a weak battery won't even power it up. By weak I do not mean some toy battery. Range is most important to me, any tips for that?

Many batteries in parallel for increased range

6V - 60V?

While the vesc will power on at 6v, it wonâ€™t have enough power to move anyone over 75 pounds and climb decent sized hills until about 24v (6s). For range, get maybe 6 3s 5000mah batteries, make each into a 6s pack.  You will be able to get over 20 miles if you use all 3 in one ride

What if I wanna make the 18650 configuration? Any recommendations for that type of thing?
