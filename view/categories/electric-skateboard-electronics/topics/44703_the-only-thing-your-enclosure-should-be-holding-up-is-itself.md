I've read this statement a few times on here. 

I guess it means that you should secure your battery/vescs to the bottom of the board THEN put the enclosure over it all.... 

But batteries are heavy - how do you achieve this? Am I just underestimating the power of glue/tape/velcro?

It's a mixed bag. Everyone has a different opinion on this.

The main fear is that attaching the battery to the enclosure will eventually cause undue strain on the mounting holes, causing them to crack or break. But this doesn't always happen, for multiple reasons: 1. enclosure made out of bombproof material  2. battery is small  3. reinforcement around the mounting holes.

I use either industrial/outside rated velcro or 3M double stick tape.  Velcro is thicker if your short on head room, 3M tape makes it a PIA to remove anything.

The theory is that the enclosure is a shield to protect your components, not a structure to hold your components.  That being said, I have built boards where I mounted everything in the enclosure and then bolted the enclosure on.  In practice its a lot easier to work on a board when you can remove the enclosure and all the components are in place.

For thinks like charge ports and volt meters that normally get mounted/recessed into the enclosure I use quick disconnects so I can fully remove the enclosure.

I don't think "universal requirement" was the objective here, just be smart.  Trampa is a special case as the enclosure is typically on top, specifically in the instances you are talking about.  And Trampa is dumb so it doesn't really count anyways :).

This is a long-standing debate. The better choice depends a lot on the deck\enclosure being used. 

A question for those that velcro right to the deck, what substrate do you use to dampen vibrations between the the deck and the components? Also, how do you attach it? Do you use foam and glue it to the deck? then affix velcro to foam?

Or do you just velcro\tape batteries and ESCs right to the wooden deck? Do the parts have material underneath them to provide some support from the enclosure?

I'm in the boat of

-plastics like ABS/kydex and vacuum/heat formed should have components mounted to the deck

-fiberglass/composites/carbon enclosures are strong and can support the weight. And be padded. Just mount to enclosure

My (limited) experience show:

(a)  You can mount everything with Gorilla tape to the bottom of the deck, and it perfectly holds things in place.   This tape is pretty strong and sticky.

(b)  You can secure the battery to the enclosure and attach it by screws without a problem.

I have 10S4P battery attached just by 4 M3 screws.  It perfectly holds it in place - there are no any signs of wear.

I think that the problems come not from the weight of the battery but from the flex of the board.   Even stiff decks can flex a little bit.  This puts a lot of stress on mounting bolts.   If you use Boosted Board style dual enclosures, then there is no any stress on the bolts.

Here is how my Gorilla style board looked like before I mounted proper enclosures:

I see no issue with mounting everything in the enclosure. If 1/8" ABS/kydex can't hold our components, which are generally less than 10lbs, your doing something wrong. 

What I've noticed is this, if your enclosure doesn't match your deck close to perfectly...forget it. If it doesn't match concavity at any point and you have to crank the bolts down in order for the enclosure to seal...forget it. In that case it will probably crack due to a combo of that internal stress, vibrations, and time. 

If your enclosure matches the deck perfectly and you have at least 6+ solid mounting points, you can mount components in your enclosure all day long. Also, a nice thick gasket made of some rubber/neoprene goes a long way.

It really depends on the specifics of your build. 
All my components are secured to the deck and the enclosure is just a cover that does supply extra security in keeping the batteries in place. 
Itâ€™s easy to mount electronics to the deck. 
Hard pack Lipos are easy to secure with servo tape. 
I have also done this with a Li-ion pack that was shrink wrapped

I have built both types.
infact I have builds with no enclosure as well.
and I have had success with all of them.

however.. i can see that a weak enclosure would break from trying to support the weight under skate vibration stress.

strong enclosure though.. no problems.

shit goes into the box with adhesives, box bolts to board.

the box becomes the battery case... the box is the shell, the armor. IF the sled falls the stuff needs to go with it not stay stuck on the board. Literally every commercial option does it this way. Enertion, Evolve, Arc Boards... nobody but DIY seems to fasten things to the deck then cover it. 

It's a perfectly valid method, and i've done it, but its certainly not the only correct one.

Following. I definitely ruined my enclosure holes with the goodies being carried by the enclosure. I don't see it happening with my cake pan but with the plastic enclosure on my Concave deck it became a serious problem. It wound up dragging on the ground eventually. Which is why I decided to use string ðŸ˜‚. So I'm going to be building a new one with fiberglass when I get the replacement deck. I will be toying with the idea of securing the battery to the deck. I liked the tape idea with foam. Problem right now is that the battery pack is essentially the enclosure and it doesn't want to come out.![20180119_220009|374x500](upload://bu3de8FfmCaAe3KQSWUOfZgFvH3.jpg)

the spacecelll pro3/4s seems to be too brittle as I've seen numerous cracks and breakages. I had mine converted into a "regular" battery pack when I started noticing stress cracks forming around the bolts. The enclosure I have for the next build is made of fiberglass. I haven't decided on how to mount yet

I'm with you on this.
All my components are in a fibreglass enclosure and bolts to the deck with m6 bolts and wood inserts.
It's not the only way but works for me, perhaps because I have confidence in the guy who built my enclosure..
Each to their own i suppose, perhaps some horror stories from people who have had problems with either method?

fiberglass is the shit. IT has all the benefits of lightweight plastics for the most part but also has the added benefit of being paintable, sculpt-able, and body-filler-able. Basically you can work on it the way you would do body work on a car and its just easier to deal with. 

just make sure you have good masking or dust management when cutting or you'll die of choking.

I'm sure there are exceptions, Like if you router out the bottom too much or buy walmart decks. But relying on a thin flange and m4 screws spaced out to hold 10+lbs of expensive electronics is stupid no matter what your enclosure is made out of.

I did two things at the same time in my Vanguard build: 

VESC's and remote receiver are permanently attached to the deck by hot glue.  The enclosure is just a cover.

The battery is held by the battery enclosure.

So the expensive electronics (e.g. VESC's) will not fall off the board.  The battery can fall, but maybe it is better for it to fall if it catches fire.

First off buy a good solid enclosure! The one I bought off @bigben is up to the job!
Once anything is stuck directly to the board or enclosure it becomes part of the structure so naturally will have more vibration travel through it.
I choose to have all my electronic components loose in my enclosure with some foam to dampen vibrations,seems to be the best option in my opinion for less stress on components.

Look up acoustic insulating foams in your local area. You can get a foam that will be non conductive,  durable, compress but will also be fire retardant.

BTW, my battery and electronics are all glued with the enclosure on all my builds.

I guess it's a matter of preference.

Disassembling is really easy, just unplug the phase wires, the sensors and the switch and you can remove the whole enclosure with electronics fot inspection or maintenance.

When glueing the battery with the enclosure you make sure the battery pack is going to be stuck with the bottom of the enclosure, gravity will help you hold it there even more. I always design batteries to allow some level of flex, so this is why I suggest to stick batteries to the enclosure so individual packs does not move, transfering the movement to be absorbed by the silicone wires connecting each group.

Just to add to this suggestion, make sure it's 100% natural cure silicone...quite a few on the market has acetic acid mixed in with the silicone, which can erode batteries and electronics. Though...I don't know if it'll eat through heatshrink.

Thatâ€™s interesting. I never thought to heat shrink a segmented pack on top of the balance wires. Great idea

So you just usually left the wires exposed outside of the wrap? 

If you leave them inside you have the benefit of no movement of the wires inside the wrap, so it's safer just put some kapton tape to avoid any shirt with the cells because of rubbing

Yeah I was just taping them down, and I put some neoprene strips on top to shield from friction from the deck. Iâ€™ll take your approach once I get the enclosure from you.

My decks have no flex, by design. If i were to build a flexy deck build, i'd likely go with a split enclosure and move the battery and ESC further apart. Or segment the battery into twin P groups and use a 7 or 8 compartment case designed to flex. 

another more interesting option would be to pot the components in neutral cure silicone directly on the deck and use scaled ABS armor plates so that it would flex with the scales like a dragon. That would make maintenance difficult, but if you set everything up right to begin with, nothing would ever be able to come loose.

AND to the box. Yeah i do their warranty work so i see all kinds of fail in there. What manner of sadist tapes to the box and the deck? but everything else is in the box.

Thanks. I was looking at options like that. First I have to take the spacecell apart. I was thinking about wrapping it in tape so its not permanently stuck, then wrap it in about one layer of fiberglass, then wrap it in some flexible foam, followed by another fiberglass wrap. Keep the vesc and batteries separate and try to make the split enclosure. This is in hopes that the foam will take the flex rather than the batteries. I wouldn't mind it being a permanent solution as the spacecell has built-in power switch, voltmeter, charge port, and mini USB port.

I'm trying to get this right the first time so it looks like a LHB build lol

Corning 737 comes highly recommended by myself and Ollin Board Co. I have a case of it and i'm never going to use anything else. 

It smells like fresh water when you use it, gels rather quickly, and cures strong yet flexible. Potting a whole pack into your enclosure and using it to seal your gaps and even waterproof your XT 
 and JST connections by smearing it on with your finger will dramatically increase the life of your build by damping vibration and virtually eliminating moisture and filth ingress in critical areas. I'm probably even going to start smearing it along the edges of my focboxes and dabbing it  over all of the connections just to completely eliminate the possibility of water damage, despite already using it to seal the flange. 

I had a guy come back with trace amounts of water in his board because he got stranded in a mansoon or some shit. Everything was fine except the BMS, which detected a short and did its job. ESCs are basically floating in mid air inside the box, everything else was sealed. Somehow moisture made its way into the BMS's heatshink, so now I'm rethinking how i wrap my packs. 

apparently the moisture found its way in through a gap in the charge port which had a broken cover.

+1 to Corning 737. A bit on the expensive side, but definitely worth it.

On a side note, silicone with acetic acid freaking SMELLS!

oh and somebody else posted it here but its definitely worth repeating. The regular clear 100% silicone, for example the GE silicone you find at wal-mart and places like that, will leave corrosive deposits on everything in your box. the only thing it doesn't seem to affect is PVC, like the PVC shrink you use on battery packs for example. The other polyoethefuckingwhatever heat shrinks it definitely attaches to and does weird shit. It seems to do nothing whatsoever to the silicone insulation on the wires, but does seem to deposit on the metal. So yeah, don't use it, it can potentially lead to shorts and damage. 

It also stinks horribly.

If you need silicon, use 2 part silicon made for pouring(mold making) its good and clean and sets up in a few minutes/seconds

every 2-part silicone I've ever used was the opposite of glue and wouldn't stick to anything.    2-part polyurethane on the other hand, which comes from the same store as the 2-part mold-making silicone, does stick really well to everything (except silicone) and sounds like it's cheaper than this 737 stuff and also can come in a bunch of different duro or cure time and color can be added or glow in the dark.    I've always stuck my lipos to the deck with it and it sticks to the polyurethane shrink on lipos really well and I assume its the same polyurethane shrink on 18650s

The lesson I'm learning here is that with a fiberglass enclosure (or some other very ridged material) and a no flex deck mounting in the enclosure is ok. With an ABS enclosire and/or flex deck mounting to the deck is the preferred method. Is that correct?

@Hummie i'm pretty sure the shrink on cells is polyvinyl chloride, or PVC. The other kind of heat shrink is polyolefin which is the stuff we use on wires. 

@mmaner depends entirely on the box design. Look at Slick Revolutions, Koowheel, Boosted, literally anyone with a flexy deck and you'll find a unique approach every time. SR did it the coolest though. Oh and i know how much you love and respect Trampa, so you might look at thier flexi box... hahahahahahahahahahahahha

i'm not a fan of flexi decks but i'd probably take the boosted or SR approach, or come up with something really out there. 

Koowheel owned it for uniqeness in my opinion. they don't even have a damned box, its a weird rubber cage and the components are all potted or encased in metal and removable.  Only issue with them is stupidly cheap... i mean like crushing you business under a massive weight of bad decisions stupidly cheap... weld on the brackets holding the ESC in place. The potted the electronics making them practically bomb proof and then did a shit job tacking their brackets on... looked really last minute.

but every deck flexes a bit even the stiffest.  I cant stomach a fully rigid enclosure imagining it will put stress on the bolts if the box is rigid too.   maybe its possible to thermoform some bend points

They way I cope with this is to pre-drill the holes in th enclosure larger than the screws I'm using,  sometimes I use rubber grommets in the pre-drilled holes and tighten down on the grommet, so the enclosure floats a little.

I've had issue with rigid enclosure cracking and breaking, but flexible enclosures tend be pretty much bomb proof (within reason).

Yo Bearded Angel.  Sorry to reply to an extremely old post, but since someone else bumped it already I figured it wouldn't be a huge party foul.

Any chance you can provide some pictures of your grommet method?  When you enlarge the drilled enclosure hole, would it make sense to slot it (in stead of just making the overall hole a larger diameter)?

I can when I get home, don't have anything with me at the moment. 

I mostly mount with M4 bolts in inserts, these days, so drill the enclosure holes at 5mm. This way the bolt slips I'm but the head covers the hole. I'm also using foam on the perimeter of the enclosure to float it, works great. That's what I would suggest.

So I realized after having to fix my board that industrial velcro is super strong. I could barely get the battery off the board. Its wrapped in some squishy material but I really had a hard time getting it off. Basically my enclosures been holding up the vesc and that's basically it. I'm going to go easier with the screws. Probably just use 4 now instead of 6.
