Can anyone suggest a good anti spark on-off switch that can handle a 12s battery pack. 
Thanks

depends on how much current you need to handle...
this one does 100a, he has some smaller ones too or you can go to "antispark heaven".

I just use an xt90 anti-spark loop key. not very flashy or anything, but it works really well!

An e-switch on your bms is the best way imo
