So I've seen a bunch of information on how to build a @MasterCho GT2B mod, but I cant figure out where I can buy one? I have a GT2B and I think I saw something on ebay that looked similar, but I didn't know if there was an official place I could order one.

The ones you see on ebay are from MasterCho himself.

MasterCho's files are available. Just need access to a printer. @Zac13
