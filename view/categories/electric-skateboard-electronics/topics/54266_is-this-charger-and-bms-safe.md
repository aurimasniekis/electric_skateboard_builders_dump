I wonder if this [BMS](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/E-bike-battery-6S-24V-15A-BMS-24v-lithium-battery-BMS-for-electric-bike-24V-8Ah/32819064213.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.31.41da5650KYHKuA&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_2_10152_10709_10151_10065_10344_10068_5722815_10342_10343_10340_5722915_10341_5722615_10696_10084_10083_10618_10710_10307_5722715_5711215_10059_308_100031_10103_10624_10623_10622_5711315_5722515_10621_10620-10152_10151_5711315,searchweb201603_31,ppcSwitch_4&algo_expid=672f406f-8cd9-4cd4-9c93-95568a13b97c-4&algo_pvid=672f406f-8cd9-4cd4-9c93-95568a13b97c&priceBeautifyAB=0) and [CHARGER](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/25-2V-3A-Charger-6S-22-2V-Li-ion-battery-Charger-24V-Lithium-Battery-Charger-Input/32842143233.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.26.422c45ebWsFTUZ&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_2_10152_10709_10151_10065_10344_10068_5722815_10342_10343_10340_5722915_10341_5722615_10696_10084_10083_10618_10710_10307_5722715_5711215_10059_308_100031_10103_10624_10623_10622_5711315_5722515_10621_10620,searchweb201603_31,ppcSwitch_4&algo_expid=08d18193-214a-40f1-85ce-0c4b0481a34b-3&algo_pvid=08d18193-214a-40f1-85ce-0c4b0481a34b&priceBeautifyAB=0) is safe to use.
I'm thinking since it is so cheap.
I will just be using it to charge.

15 amps is very low. Do you plan to bypass?
Cheap stuff is usually not reliable
The charger is fine. I have that one. So far so good.

Is this Bms too cheap maybe? Or will it be okay?

If you plan to bypass no need to buy an expensive one. I can vouch for the charger but i dunno about that bms. Wait for a second opinion.
