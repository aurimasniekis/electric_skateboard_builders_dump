```
So, I bought two mini FSESC4.20 and I connected them via CAN. I set up everything:
Master > ID-0, send over can: no, multiple escs over can: yes
PPM with UART, and can cable plugged in
Slave > ID-1, send over can: yes, multiple escs over can: no
no app

Now, only the master motor spins. I did everything again. Ackmaniac 3.102 firmware. Motor detection, etc. Again the same. Only one motor spins. I even soldered the can cable direkt to the pins. Still no.
Does anyone have any ideas? I used to run dual VESC 4.12 with no problem before that.

Did you plug in the canbus wire while power was on?

No, everything was connected beforehand

ThatÂ´s exactly what I did. But still only one motor spinning

well, i run mine over split ppm, so no real expierence in can bus mode

Try switching master to slave and vice versa

Donâ€™t you need to set â€žmultiple vesc over canâ€œ in master and slave to yes? ðŸ¤”

Probably a dull vesc. You can split ppm if you don't need canbus. But probably better to send ut back

Hi man.Sorry, I didn't reply to you in time. Has your problem been solved?

What I did was turn the switch to off first.. 

Then I ran the connection wizard for both escs, one for master, one for slave. The slave one has to be set to a different ID the. The master. Somehow the wizard worked better than when I tried doing this myself.

After this is done, turn switch back on (power down first). Then give it another go.

Incidentally I usually do all the motor detection separately too..

Not yet, seems like the CAN doesnÂ´t work. Is there any way I can check, if the connection is working?

How can I run configure the ESC when the power is off? 
The problem is that both esc work on their own, but not in dual.

No I mean when u swap the USB cable turn off the power...

Setup using the wizard for both master and slave.

Incidentally, you are testing the motor movement with a remote?

Have you tried  multiple escs over can: YES on the master and slave?

I wonder if u can test for connectivity using a multimeter on the CANBUS pins across the two escs... Just to make sure that they are indeed internally connected via the switch...

EDIT: I apologies, I re-read your post, you bought TWO mini VESCs... I thought you had the DUAL VESCs... apologies.. In this case make sure you connect the CANBUS wire in the correct order.

Running out of ideas... Are the two ESCs grounded to each other? (e.g. share the same battery).

Also, are you using your remote to check if they spin in unison or the VESCtool desktop app?

Tried everything. Running out of ideas as well. Gemma from flipsky now told me I should send them back

Make sure thats not a cold solder on the CAN connector..looks abit suspicous..

Had a normal can bus cable on it before which worked fine on another setting. Solder is solid

I had two tb vescs for two years connected via can before that. Then, one vesc blew up and the other one didn't work properly, so I switch to flipsky vesc

So, I couldnÂ´t get the two ESCs to work in dual mode, but they offerend me to send it back and refund my money for store credit and they pay for the shipping.  Will order the 6.6 dual next and hope that I will work :slight_smile:

I used to have that issue, I solved it by changing my cables be cause the CAN connector wires was a dud for some reason.
