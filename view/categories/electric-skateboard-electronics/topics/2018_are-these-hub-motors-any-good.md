Guys has anyone tried these hub motors ? Are they any good ? They come with both esc's aswell as remote controller. ESC's are 6s which is what I need for a battery that I can take on a plane. 
Seems like a good deal and I consider buying them. But I am just curious if they are ok.

10amp esc? Nope!
Battery on a plane? Nope! 

Sorry can't bring lithium on planes anymore :( 
And the esc is prob no good. You're better off buying hubs from @hummie 

Little more money. Quality should be far better.

The ESC's are 100amps, supposedly. I believe @torqueboards has a set of these hub motors.

These need a specific set of trucks.. The hub motors have thicker thane than the front wheels which I didn't like too much.

I may possibly have a hub motor soon depending on how it works after testing.. We'll see.

Oh so it comes with one truck or both?  How's the quality of the hubs and the esc? Good on speed? ,torque?  Would you recommend it?

I'd probably wait but I haven't tested them.. I didn't like how the wheels on the back/front were different sized threads.

Back is like wheel is maybe 65mm (guess) and the front would be the standard 52mm.

Yea that is pretty unsightly. I have some hubs coming in but I'd like to find a low cost alternative
