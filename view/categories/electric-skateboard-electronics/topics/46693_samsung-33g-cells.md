I was surfing the internet for good 18650's when I came across this
https://www.imrbatteries.com/samsung-33g-18650-3500mah-6-5a-flat-top-battery/
At a staggering 3.256 wh/dollar, it seems a bit too good to be true compared to Sam. 30Q's 2.611 wh/dollar. :star_struck:  Output current seems really good for a low profile rider. :baby:t2: Have any of you guys tried this cells, or am I going to take the first dip? :no_mouth:

Also, I found this which seems to have a bit of discrepancy from IMR

I am planning on building a 10s5p pack with these which would give me a max of only 1kw but reaching 610wh of range. Range is something I look more forward to than speed(at least 25mph :ok_hand:t2:).

They have more strict cycling rules: don't recharge until 20% and don't discharge until 80% for long cycles, put cells at 50% for longterm storage, thinner packaging, more sensitive to temperatures, and in general have a higher tendency to explode.

The deal with Lipos is that they have a much flatter discharge curve therefore you might think it's at 60% when it's at 30% if you don't measure accurately enough.

```
The most significant difference between lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries is the chemical electrolyte between their positive and negative electrodes. In Li-Po batteries it isn‚Äôt a liquid. Instead, Li-Po technology uses one of three forms: a dry solid, which was largely phased out during the prototype years of lithium polymer batteries; a porous chemical compound; or, a gel-like electrolyte. The most popular among these is the last one, which is the type of battery you‚Äôll find in newer laptop computers and electric cars. The catch is that plenty of companies are not actually selling you a true Li-Po battery, instead it‚Äôs a lithium-ion polymer battery, or a Li-ion in a more flexible casing.

Both lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries have their pros and cons. Typically, the advantages of a lithium-ion is their high power density, lack of what‚Äôs called the memory effect (when batteries become harder to charge over time), and their significantly lower cost than lithium-polymer. In the words of Wired, ‚ÄúLithium-ion batteries are incredibly efficient. They stuff freakish amounts of energy in a tiny package.‚Äù But, as anyone might have seen with the recent saga of a certain cellphone brand being banned from flights, lithium-ion batteries are inherently unstable, suffer from aging, and are potentially dangerous. If the barrier that separates the positive and negative electrode is ever breached, the chemical reaction can cause combustion (fire). As Li-ion batteries have become more popular in consumer electronics, businesses have tried to lower costs by cutting corners. While quality batteries are perfectly safe, you should always be careful when buying no-name brands.

Lithium-polymer batteries, on the other hand, are generally robust and flexible, especially when it comes to the size and shape of their build. They are also lightweight, have an extremely low profile, and have a lower chance of suffering from leaking electrolyte. But lithium-polymer batteries aren‚Äôt perfect either: they are significantly more costly to manufacture, and they do not they have the same energy density (amount of power that can be stored) nor lifespan as a lithium-ion.

Danger is the same
All Lithium batteries blow up li ion isnt safer than Lipo since the batteries are going in the enclosure none of them will be liable to physical damage or blowing up especially if you damp the vibrations
The weakest point of li ions is the wiring if you fail even some small shit your battery can go up in flames after some time

Note that it is not just a matter of cell geometry and size (18650 in this example).
Mostly just about the chemistry (See chart below, the lower the better) and outer shell.

Lipos tend to expand more, and if the volume expansion (on a full charge) is not taken into account it can end bad. The same goes to the pouch construction itself: Less perforation safety. 
Lipos also do not have any valve mechanism (PIC-2), and if moisture gets into the pouch it will end as in PIC-3 (Fluoridic acid).

That depends what you are comparing it to - compared to a pouch cell, an 18650 is the safest when it comes to liquid electrolyte. The cid system makes an 18650 cell far more safer than a pouch one. It all comes down to how the cells are handled. If the user makes a mistake, then the batteries reply with a boom - cannot wait until solid electrolyte batteries are offically a thing - more reading about it here: [interesting link warning](https://about.bnef.com/blog/goodenough-making-progress-solid-state-batteries-qa/) - when it comes to saftey, you could stab this new technology and it would not even release any smoke... :smiley:

At 5p with those 33G cells you have 33A "rated" current, but you WILL kill those cells in a month or two, they will loose performance like crazy. Same goes for the Panasonic PF cells @getyorma  mentioned if you are going to use them close to the "rated" limit, they will suffer, 8p is great, 80A peaks, but still, with 2 motors I'd say its close to the limit of PF's.

You must have overhead with li-ion cells. I am using VTC6 cells in 4p for my battery, which is "theoretically rated" for 120A, with a smal catch- the batteries MUST not reach 80 degrees C. Means a cooled pack is required. In real world testing even the mighty VTC6 can only do 15A continous without cooling (so my pack becomes rated for 60A, just about right with ~30% headroom)

Now about safety... I will not go into details of what Li-po cells are made of, its too deep. But i will say this:

18650 cells that come from a trusted manufacturer are MUCH safer than any damned Li-po you can find. they will NOT blow up. But they can catch fire under some circumstances. A "nice" example - a guy is spot welding some cells, cranks up the welder to max for some dumb reason and forgets- the electrode punctures the cell from the top shorting the anode and cathode- a literal fountain of chemial fire appears. Bad move. Smillarly if a large pack is shorted it can catch fire.

To prevent bad situations one thing people should do is build battery packs where each cell has individual fuses. It is the thing that can really prevent a flaming battery

But all in all you can do really a lot of damage to 18650's without having anything bad happen. All thanks to the quite a few sophisticated safety mechanisms in the cell, a good picture posted by @bevilacqua (but one must keep in mind that cheap chinese "ultrafire" level batteries dont have many, if any of those. short an ultrafire and it will explode on you. In a while. Same for damaging or shorting a Li-po... No, please don't. Its literally a bomb. Mainly because no standards, no really trusted and safe constructions.. its all a black dangerous chemical box.

I am really treating VTC6‚Äôs as 15A cells to keep them happy.

Too keep them happy, you need to treat them as 10A cells. More reading: [VTC6 bench test](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/sony-vtc6-15a-3000mah-18650-bench-test-results-a-great-battery-equaling-hg2-30q.754649/)

>  * At 10A continuous it reached 2875mAh. This is great performance for 3000mAh cell at 10A so I am rating this cell at 3000mAh. 
> * At 15A continuous the temperature rose to 72¬∞C. This is a few degrees below the average temperature of a cell running at its continuous discharge rating (CDR).

want to know what else keeps cells very happy? not charging them to 4.2 and discharging below 3.0. If you charge to 4.0- 4.1 you are effectively doubling the cycles you can get out of them. Same goes for discharging below 3.0 or somewhere around there.

My BMS is 60A, but I think with 40A my ride will still be good even with the fat 200mm wheels. 190kv motor, 1:5 (or 5.5) reduction

Yup! Personally i charge up to 4.1 volts and discharge them max to 3.3-3.4v per cell, im currently making a custom BMS, where i can set the balance voltage to whatever i want :D. Discharging your cells under 3.0v is not good, also it depends on the manifucturer - some cells can be discharged lower and some a bit higher. Personally i would go minimum 3.2v per cell, since there is almost no energy left in the cell. 3.3v is a sweet spot for me


I get 40+km on my 12s8p pack, and i rarely ride that much in a single run, so getting 20% less range while doubling cycle life is pretty neat, i recently finished an essay on lithium batteries, too bad that it's in Estonian :sweat_smile:, it would be a good read for anyone.

If you don't charge up to 4,2V and have a "standard" BMS witch starts to balance at full charge your cells will dirft as the time passes...

Interesting, these cells seems to have cheap capacity/$ but if I understand correctly their esk8 use only really works if using maybe 6P+ otherwise you are pulling amps at a rate each cell can't really handle.

Wondering if you were to build a 6p/7p/8p pack for a eMTB, would they be da bomb or a bomb?

At what parallel pack size do these cells become a contender?

The reason I ask is that I don;t really want to fininace another 7p 30Q purchase and will be looking for a eMTB later in the year.

@bevilacqua and @xilw3r
In my experience, the cid doesn't make a difference when a cell gets shorted I've had many side wall ruptures, violent explosions when the bottom corners rupture  and sometimes if I'm lucky the CID will trip. It's almost random

How the hell do you get a sidewall rupture? I mean ive made holes accidentally when welding on the negative, but with correct usage one should never get a random explosion from the side.

The only explanation i can think of right now would be dendrite formation to cause that. Means your cells were punctured and running without electrolyte or you were using the cells a bit too hard core for too long

I've specifically tested shorting out battery packs. It's one of the airforce requirements. When shorted, the pattern is very much random.

This did not happen during regular use. It was a test specifically made to see how the battery would react to an outside short without protection from the BMS.

NASA has performed similar tests with similar results. They're trying to improve the reliability of the CIDs and bottom of the cell venting to decrease side wall rupturing. I believe they had something like a 30% side wall rupturing in their testing. 

Plus, the CID venting is only safe if the vent is not pointed directly at another cell. That's why in most applications cells aren't stacked on top of each other without something between them. Have you seen how esk8 packs are assembled? If a cell CID blows, you have at best a 50% chance of it venting away from the rest of the pack. If it vents directly into another cell, then you just made things worse.

The youtuber Jehu Garcia briefly addresses this subject in a video where he refers to NASA studies regarding lipo vs liion battery safety, where they /he comes to the conclusion that liions are at a whole different safety level compared to the more dangerous lipos. 

I'll see if I can come up with the reference. Seems to be a plethora of NASA battery studies...

They are cheapest cells for sub 600wh at 10s5p. Power is not a problem for me. 450w is enough to blaze me 25mph. üòé

Could you tell us what is the safest cell technology today, after LiFePo4, please?!

Of course using with all safety measures like cell fusing and good BMS.

Sure? 450w isnt alot.. I think you will get tired of just 450w pretty fast, and wish you had more.. But that just me.

450w should get him there.  Looks like I was pulling around 350 to maintain 22-23mph.   450w probably won't fare well on inclines though.

That idiot is still here. Not that i am offended, it is still only a forum, but your tone of language has a real stink to it.

I can only imagine how much sharing would be here if everyone spoke like that. :thinking:

I keep thinking 18650 are way safer than lipo. They have a can, they are vented and some of them have safe chemistry.  I will not waste my time trying to convince anyone so do not waste your time with me either.
A low quality 18650 is more dangerous than a good lipo. That's a fact.
A high quality 18650 is better than any lipo. Very low disbalance and even self balance in the case of spinel cells.
This is a "failed" test with konions:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMWRyTHfgRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMWRyTHfgRA)

That dude got pissed because the guaranteed explosion never happened.
I used lipo for many years and now I moved to the li ion world.
You guys claim most accidents on this forum happened with 18650....
Well I lost the count of lipo fires at endless-sphere.com I guess that's why most of us think li ion is safer. That's just my opinion. You have yours.

The point I was trying to make is it doesn't matter how "safe" the cells are if the builder isn't good or care to follow safety guidelines. If you don't know how to weld or practice welding, dont know how to solder, don't understand why you're doing what you're doing, use the wrong type of adhesive, etc. then it doesn't matter how "safe" the cells are, you are just as likely to have a fire if not more since it's a lot less involved to make a lipo pack

This point of discussing how safe a type of battery is really see which chemistry has a wider "abuse" range. To some extend, nothing is safe if you don't do what you are supposed to.
