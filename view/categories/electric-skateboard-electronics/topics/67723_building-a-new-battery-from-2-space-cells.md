So I sold my Raptor 1 and I have 2 10s3p space cells about the same age and same cells in both batteries. Im in the process of tearing them apart to make a 12s5p but not sure how bad it would be to use cells from 2 different batteries. They are of the same age and the cells so far are all 3.7v

Should be fine, if you want to be extra careful, make each cell into an individual and put it on a battery charger with a cycle feature (charge to full, discharge to empty, charge to storage, display results).

Sort each battery based on capacity, use similar batteries in your P groups. Discard any batteries that have more than 10% capacity loss.

Thanks for the advice I will do that worst case I'll settle for a 12s4p
