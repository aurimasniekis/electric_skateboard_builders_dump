Hi guys I have a Trampa eMTB and am using the Maytech 12s ESC for it. 
They were working really amazingly except for the brakes being way too strong and not adjustable. 
After finding many had the same issue and it wasnt fixable i was going to send them back. But i tried one last effort.
This post is going to save anyone with this same issue so dont throw out those esc yet!
@mccloed @JLabs @Nowind @squad @Kaly     

Fist of all this Maytech esc is same exact esc that TB is selling and the same as 12s FVT esc (Sleeping Lion) also. The only version with bad brakes is the Maytech one. So in the future I suggest buying the ESC direct from FVT for a much cheaper price than Maytech sells them and without the brakes issue.

So on to how to fix the problem...I had to contact the engineer at Shenzen FVT company (the guy that actually invented and maintains the firmware of this ESC). I cant say enough how helpful and nice he was. We worked together for many hours over Skype in the middle of my night in NY (since that's when hes working). He sent me many custom edited version of firmware and waited for me in between so i could test it and report back to him. After may hours (5am) he finally dialed in the firmware to be perfect. 

Finally some satisfaction and we got normal progressive and adjustable brake!!! :smile: 

Just upgrade to the firmware below and set your brake force. Enjoy your brakes!!!

Thanks for mentioning me in this post! My friend from poland (@idea at ES) had chat with exactly the same guy from FVT and finally got probably the same firmware. My only concern is if this firmware will work with sensored motors too, as far as I know FVT 12S ESC does not have port for hall sensors.

I asked him about it. First he send me a car port without sensors and then he changed it cuz i asked. He said it will work with sensors also.

That's GREAT, I will give it a shot in near future, I got one of my maytech ESCs back after repair and have to rebuild my board (also need to upgrade chain to 25H instead of 6x2,8mm). Thanks a lot! So You normally upgraded firmware by USB programmer and an app (do You have any new version of it, I have the one maytech sent me)?

You guys are very welcome, its the least i could give back to this community. 
Now everyone can ride safely with your new brakes :wink: 

I have the USB link and software from Maytech. That software is made by FVT also. So you don't need anything else.

This is the one on FVT's page:

Then you just have to load the firmware on it.

Does anyone know about flashing an ESC? There are some cheaper ESCs like this:

http://www.hobbypartz.com/07e-c-platinum-70a-hv-opto.html

They run the same Silabs MCU as the one discussed in this thread.  I know they can be flashed with BLHeli and .HEX files, but no idea how one would go about trying to flash one with a .HGM file.

Thanks, Dude! I'll have to try this out when I get back from AZ. I went back and forth with the sales person from FVT who was going back and forth with the engineer. I got a couple of firmwares out of him but nothing that fixed the brakes. Way to go!

Hey that's good results. Not sure about your issues. I'm not having any with random brakes or not synchronized beeping. Try using my settings below. I didn't like very slow acceleration. much better set to high. also make sure to set your trim on the remote properly. Also make the neutral range less if the delay is annoying. I'm using 190kv motors not sensored and a 15/ 65 gearing

I finally was able to upload this firmware to my ESCs, unfortunately they started acting weird. I'm using nano remote and I think this may be what's causing this problem. So, when I fully break and then rapidly release throttle lever, ESCs for second recognize that as full throttle. After fiddling for many hours with throttle trim potentiometer (it's almost completely turned to max counterclockwise position, ESCs take a while in this trim position to notice receiver and start), and setting neutral range to 3%, I don't get this strange full-throttle-while-releasing-break action.
Something like this has never happened with the old firmware.

Hey @squad, This issue is 100% related to the winning/nano remote. I believe someone did a tutorial on how to fix this. The other solution is to get a hobbyking receiver and bind to it. The hobbyking receiver has worked for me.

Noob question, does this ESC work on a 60kv-100kv range hub motor? Let's say hummies or TBs hub motor? and how do you adjust the settings on a computer? Do they provide a program file or something and you hook them up with a usb?

Hey sorry for the late response. 
I cant be sure and dont want to be held responsible, But the software on the computer looks identical. I Think it should be ok since all of those are made by the same FVT. 
Also maybe contact FVT directly, they are pretty responsive they can answer if you don't want to try it.

@Factory72: You have to send an email to bruno, on the website Alienpowersystem and ask the "ESC HV 12s with fan", it is not on website directly. price approx 100euros

@monkey32: You need just the software Setup_HighVol_SCT120A_151014, you can find it here: http://alienpowersystem.com/downloads/
You connect your esc to your computer by the USB adaptater, power on the esc, you click "update", you select this firmware : http://www.nyboards.com/HighVol120A_SkateBoare_161122_portCar150728_best.hgm

Does anyone remember how to get this ESC set up. I loaded the new firmware per this thread.

When I turn on the ESC, it gives me a lot of rapid, evenly spaced beeps. Must be doing something wrong, but it didn't come with any instructions, so I'm not sure how to get it set up correctly.

@johnny_261 yes, that's what i meant.. I assume with firmware reflash, you might need to re-pair the remote.. so im not sure have you done it or not.. which might be possible i think after a reflash, that you need to repair..

otherwise .. ask some ppl directly who have flashed it before.. maybe something went wrong.. but my 1st option would be to repair it with remote, if you havent done that already..

@johnny_261  To be honest.. I just saw that some ppl sell ''pre-paired'' remotes, so it might as well stay there and it is not dependant on the esc..

but in your place I would still try to do it.. since maybe the throttle position does need to be dialed in anyways..

Has anyone tried this in the sensored mode? I'm having issues with random acceleration for less then a second after releasing the brakes with the FVT ESC (bought in February 2017). It doesn't happen in the non-sensored mode.

I've tried it with both the old Maytech remote and the new one and the issue is the same.

Is the PWM period of 10ms expected?

And here is the full range of signals:

Hey contact Jenny from FVT. The engineer there is the one that makes the firmware. He will fix it for you. Much better than maytech support. 

I don't use sensored mode so not sure. I find I don't really need it on my trampa board since it already does a wheelies off the line. Try it without sensors and set initial acceleration to high or very high.

@kaspars Very interesting even though I don't know exactly how to interpret those results. LOL. Could this possibly explain why my sensored TB esc will sometimes spontaneously go into reverse at low speeds, despite being set up for only forward/brake? Kind of scary and disconcerting when that happens. Can't recall it ever happening when I was running unsensored.

Hey there!
Guys, I hope you can help me.

I have this one ESC from FVT (bought on aliexpress FVT-SWLI0100-HV 120A HV-OPTO 5~12S LiPo 15~36S NiMh Brushless ESC w/USB Setting ) like this one - 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/maytech-12s-esc-new-firmware-to-fix-the-brakes/13545/9?u=p_j_f

And I have a problem with it. It doesn't brake. I tried to change settings through USB Link, tried to upload new firmware - nothing helps. 
Look, at first everything looks good, usb link software gives me two green lights in "Link status"

But then, when I press "read settings", in the window I see "reading..." and nothing go on. It can read for hours. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/a/aa5daad723b84be81dac74bf155ea7d86d6cb7b3.JPG" width="666" height="500">

When I press "upgrade firmware" it says "Pls wait" and again, nothing changes. Finally, when I change settings and press "Send settings"  it says "sending" and then "ok", but still nothing changes((((

I really need your help, guys. My eSK8 doesn't finish only because of it  and I can't ride it without brakes((((

Not sure about this one. The firmware is good for me. I dont have the same exact one you have but they look very similar.
Maybe your esc is defective, because you cant view or change your settings even without the new firmware. Dont think you can upload the new firmware until you figure out why your USB_link software isn't reading the settings.  
Also contact FVT directly, they are pretty responsive they can answer skype:jennyxcy2008

Yeah, looks like my ESC have some issues, because it still doesn't work, BUT after few times I tried to upload firmware, it have changed throttle range. It is strange, because now I can't reset it and can't turn it to programming mode o_O

2. My esc is burned down. Forgot to turn off the battery before unplug usb from PC (((
3. Looks like sleeping lion is good choice for the money. Where I can order one with international shipping? 
Or may be someone can advice me another esc 120A for 10S LiPo?

That's is 12 degree is the motor timing . Start up power is how fast you can accelerate. I have mine set too high.

It's not a major issue for me but I'm not too happy with the brakes on my board. Kind of unpredictable behavior. Can/should this firmware be installed on TorqueBoards 12S ESC? Did anyone do it successfully and happy with the results?

Your ESC is not bad. You seem to be using an older version of the USB Link program. I had the same problem. Try the AlienPowerSystem's or the FVT 1.3 or 1.5 (can't remember) program and it will read your settings correctly. Good luck!

Looks like FVT has fixed the issue in their latest firmware release 170818 (August 18, 2017) which is [available from their downloads page](http://szfvt.com/en/download-6.html):

Here is the version as reported by the config tool:

No more random acceleration after releasing the brakes!

Wait what? You guys were having random acceleration after releasing the brakes? I;m still using the first version with my own configuration and its running fine.

That only happened in the sensored mode, see [this video on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kasparsdambis/36822343695).

i don't see a video. If you're talking about sensored then that would explain why my older sensored motor kept moving by itself even after Im at standstill. interesting, this really solve a lot of questions i had for those motors.

Even worse for me when running sensored and forward/brake/reverse mode, at low speed (luckily) and at partial forward throttle, the motor randomly went into low speed reverse while I was riding. Happened a couple times, the most shocking incident being on asphalt, riding at about 10mph and instantly coming to a screeching halt cause the motor switched into reverse. Good thing these boards are so long and I had foot straps and only running single drive at the time otherwise I would have been thrown off. I switched to forward/brake mode after that and haven't had that problem since. Freaking scary though.

Sounds cool. Wonder if they fixed random full throttle on startup.

Nah, same thing. I apply full brake, then start from standstill and it goes full throttle. Using 70% PWM limit for brakes helps, but there's still a small chance it'll do a wheelie on startup.

So the key to smooth riding on these escs is to use brakes as little as possible and not to let it freewheel :smiley:

@vap That sounds very similar to the issue I was having before. The latest update fixed that, though. Are you running it sensored?

Which remote are you using?

I'm using my own NRF24l+arduino remote and receiver, so yea it could be the signal noise.
I also tried one of my frsky d4r receivers and quadcopter controller when i first installed them, i could reproduce same behavior. Haven't tried it with the new firmware though.

Hmm, i've already added capacitors everywhere, i might try adding LC filter to the receiver.

So how did this turn out in the end? Are the breaks comparable to the vesc's or not?

Hi! I am struggeling a bit with the brakes myself. The firmware you are linking in the top of the thread, is it for the FVT 120A 6-12S single ESC, or the Dual?
I've got the dual, but I am guessing it will work on that also?
Just to make things perfectly clear; the firmware you provide are for this ESC:
[Link to FVT official site](http://www.szfvt.com/en/proshow-105-3-54-54-100-16-3.html)

Because I've got this:

Hope you will get back to be. 
Best regards.

Hey all!

I'm trying to flash the firmware on this ESC:
![image|500x500](upload://iIGISx7BQaFNUBsQRNB7wFqRiWq.jpeg) 

When connecting the USB programming card, I can't get the software to recognize the ESC. Do you have to provide external power to the ESC for it to work? I think I need to connect a BEC to the other servo cable but I don't wan't to damage the logic boards.

Thanks!
```
