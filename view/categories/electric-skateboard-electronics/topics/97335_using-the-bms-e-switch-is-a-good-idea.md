So I have a Bestech BMS with e-switch but the board has to be ON to charge, which means the FOCBOX's are also ON while charging...

Is this a problem? Should I just keep the e-switch always ON and add an ANTI-SPARK SWITCH between the battery and the FOCBOX's?

No its not a problem, more of a feature is you ask me :) 
With the focbox on i can get a notification when charging is done via the metr app :)

I have the Metr Pro bluetooth module, how can i configure the Metr App to notify me when charge is complete?
