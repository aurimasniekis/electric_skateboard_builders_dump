Yes! But it's not that easy for you.
I suggest you to do some research first, cause you aren't in the topic that's clear.

A all in one solutions comes from Enertion and TorqueBoards will offer one soon.

You can go with Lipos too, but therefor you need some knowledge first.

You would need a battery with at least 22.2v and would recommend 5000mah. I use the venom fly 22.2v 5400mah. Hope I could help!

I changed the title & category, putting the question in the title allows people to easily find this later.
