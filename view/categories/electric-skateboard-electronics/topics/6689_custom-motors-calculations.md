Trying to build a small hub motor myself, I would like to curate some equations about internals of motors.

If someone has the answer to a question, please give the equation, the source and a simple explanation. Experiments are forbidden. Only theorical stuff :slight_smile: 

- How to determine KV from Turns, AWG and Stator Teeth?

- How to get maximum Power in W of a motor?

- How to get maximum Cureent in A of a motor?

- How to get no load RPM of a motor?

- Relation between Torque, RPM, Mecanical Power and Eletric Power

- Some equations with magnets power, and stator lamination?

Don't hesitate to add formulas, this is a curation post.
