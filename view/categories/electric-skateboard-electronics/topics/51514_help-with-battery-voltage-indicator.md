My battery indicator has percentage and voltage options. On the back it is a function button and a set button. When I turn on the board is showing battery percentage and I press function button to switch to voltage and then when I turn off and on again it goes back to battery percentage.. Anyone familiar with it? There is anyway to stay always on voltage?![20180407_154105_HDR|281x500](upload://a65u7NXc6TzHNIMow8yqSJDLf3p.jpg)![Screenshot_2018-04-07-10-32-18|250x500](upload://o7b700C8GliNNWw4Sd22Nrr7qCZ.jpg)
