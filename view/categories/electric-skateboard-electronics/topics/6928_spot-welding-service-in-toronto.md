Hi guys, I have a bunch of batteries coming in and I plan on making a 7s6p pack out of Panasonic18650's

Do you guys happen to know anyone in the Toronto area who could possibly help me out with combining my batteries together to make the pack? I've been searching everywhere for a spot welder and or battery pack maker for 3 weeks now and no luck :frowning:

Or this route as another option. Also arduino controlled, but uses mains power and microwave oven transformer if you feel like living life on the edge :fearful:

Anytime! Id be happy to help,  If you JUST want spot welding, itll be 35 bucks plus shipping.  (i use souble stacked 10mm thich nickel strip)  If you want to pay a little extra i can heat shrink, add all the leads and add a soft switch and bms +charger to your pack.

Hey, I'm in mississauga.  I'm making my battery pack as well but I've chosen to go the DIY route. I've got the spot welder 90% of the way to complete. Just got to make a frame to hold the electrodes in the right place and spacing.  Once I get my nickel strips I can start practicing and if it works out as its supposed to then I can help you put with that no problem! It's still like 1-3 weeks wait on the delivery of everything but the batteries  though :disappointed:

@JuniorPotato93 hey man! Tell me how it goes :) my stuffs coming in too, for those who read this I decided to see how gearbest will treat me so, I guess I'll be able to help figure out the authenticity of it, Hopefully your thing works and we can work together!

@barajabali That sounds like an interesting proposition :) , I have all the parts already coming in (BMS, charger, input jack, etc) would you be alright if I send you the package and you put it together?

Hey whats the watthours of the battery you want to make. Once you exceed 99wat hours I think you have to have a certification to be able to ship it. That's why I couldn't get mine shipped up.
