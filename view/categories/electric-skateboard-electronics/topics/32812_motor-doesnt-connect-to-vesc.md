I have not found any thing that helped me whit my problem. 

 I use the BLDC tool to program my vesc but my motor doesn't spin when i start detection or when i try to use my remote. When i press start detection my vescs blinks red and my motor doesn't spin at all. I know that the remote is connected. I have tried it with two identical motors and none of them spin. So i would be weird if i gott both broken. (I have not gotten no fault code) Thx for your help! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/7/575a53f631197a041d45ccd027416f426cfb13cb.PNG" width="690" height="412"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/2/429b337c083362a592d4bdb6518c04e3fa46f1a5.PNG" width="690" height="408">
