So I found a supplier for the highly anticipated Samsung 30T and 40T, but I not sure which one would be better for my build, so I'll lay out the info and hopefully someone can give some good advice :slight_smile:  Now I'm planning on building an AWD setup and would like to make a 12s5p pack, but I may have to settle for a 12s4p, due to size, so which of these three cells would you guys recommend (ignoring price). One thing I've read which I don't really know how it applies to Esk8 since these reviews are done mainly for vapping, but it says that the 40T is a better cell for regulated use, and the 30T is better for unregulated use.  Also, with how powerful these cells will make the packs, will I require a certain level of ESC, (FOCBOX, VESC 6 (ESCape)) 


Samsung 30T $10/cell (as a rewrap Vapcell)
3100mAh 35A

Samsung 40T $11/cell (as a rewrap Vapcell)
4000mAh 30A

Also, the supplier is promoting another cell which is a rewrap of a Sanyo NCR20700A , it's a Vapcell 20700 3200mAh 30A , $6.50. Now this is a pretty good price I think for a cell that is so similarly spec'd as the others.  Now I don't mind paying $10 or so a cell if it is for the best cell available, but if there is another cell that's pretty close and about 30% less, I'll certainly consider that.  What do you guys think?

https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/bench-test-results-vapcell-gold-30a-3200mah-20700…accurately-rated-a-sanyo-ncr20700a-rewrap.837069/

Personally I'm leaning towards the Samsung 40T, I think that would be the ultimate, most powerful cell to use, especially if I'm going to be restricted to a 12s4p pack AND be running 4WD...  Anyway, thoughts???  Thanks for your help guys!

Well I might end up using the N.E.S.E modules, so that would mean none, but if I don't use that and build it normally, why would that require less spot welding?  Though, I'm not really concerned with that.  I want whichever is going to be the best cell for my build.

```
The 21700 have almost 50% greater volume than an 18650, which means you'll use less cells for a given volume. So if you have a 2500 cm^3 of volume to work with, you could fit 150 18650s in that volume or fit 107 21700s in that same volume.

The 150 18650 will probably get you better results for the money spent.  150 18650 will be more energy than 107 21700s

## \#7 Posted by: aethyr Posted at: 2018-05-15T17:46:56.617Z Reads: 326

Yes, it will be cheaper to buy 50% more 18650 since the 40Ts are 2x more and he'd get 50% more capacity and equivalent current rating with an 18650 pack. We've repeatedly said this but he's really dead set on the superiority of a _single_ cell, so at this point, let him build his 40T pack at 2x the cost it needs to be. What's really going to be interesting is how he builds his pack. 120 amp continuous capable arrangement of cells, but probably going to use 0.15x7mm strips

1) 10S not 12S
2) depends on what you're optimising for.  You need to let us know.  It can be probably any two of

weight
cost
power
range
size

Whatever the argument up there is ^.

Only if you truely are doing 4wd...

Otherwise anything above 3p is a waste IMO... Your talking cool 35a/cell, 3p is 105a continuous.. the point of these is weight savings.. to get 100a out of something like 30q is 5p minimum.

30T = 68.2g
12s3p = 36 cells
36*68.2= 2455.2g

30q = 46g
12s5p = 60 cells
60*46 = 2760g


Let's up it one to try to match current.
30q, 12s6p = 3312g
30T 12s4p = 3273.6g

Not that different.. pretty sure 18650 is less volumetric space.. someone can correct me if I am wrong, but likely cheaper then 30t as well..

Anyway...

```
30T and 30q are both rated for 4a max charge. If you run fewer 30Ts then you won't get the same braking ability.

I've never reached my boards battery max in any of my rides, but I have seen battery min several times. In my mind this would probably rule out the 30T.

If you're making a AWD board your cells still won't powerful enough in 4p configuration to Max out all four motors at once.

With that in mind 120 battery amps split in four is 30a.  
So basically any VESC will do because good luck pulling that kind of power continuous.  

[quote="uigiroux, post:3, topic:55450"]

I'm assuming from your track record you didn't look up the amp limits for these.  Even for V2 it appears to not have enough amp draw for high power builds.

Please tell us why...

I feel like every one of these questions has been discussed in detail, specifically by you and many others throughout this forum.

You won't convince him. He's dead set on the 40T and doesn't know how to math. Let him waste his money how he wants. I'm actually curious how he's going to build his pack. I thought nese modules are only 18650?

Just repeating what everyone said, for now, none of this cells have an advantage for a regular build, the only place I see them being better only in a XS1P config, the rest, when you do the math for weight and volume they are worse, even you keep the price out of the discussion 

That being said, I can’t wait for some people to crash their model 3 so we can get our hands on the cells, if the rumors of the cells being lower rated to increase cicle life are true, maybe them they are worth due to a bigger energy density

Or when the price of a 2X700 is the same as a 18650

Actually I'm very good at math.  This topic has been discussed a lot, but it usually goes along the lines of trashing all cells but the 30Q, and saying how all others are over priced for what they are.  NESE are for 18650 but I spoke to the owner and he said he could make them for larger cells.  Ok so why exactly are 30Q's better than the 40T in a 12s4p/12s5p?  They're 3000mAh and 15A, the 40T is 4000mAh and 30A.  For the amount of space, and ignoring cost, how does a 30Q out perform the 40T in a 4WD build, or even a 2WD build?   Just facts please?

Bro, if you wanna spend your Money. Spend it. Noone will stop you. Only good argument here is that you need the extra drain current for those hungry hubs. 

(3000mah) 241 wh/kg, 3 euro/cell vs. (4000mah) 220 wh/kg, 9.3 euro/cell. 
Hvn't even done the space calculation, but you're good with math etc.

I've done the space calculations, and putting 18650's doesn't allow me to put enough cells to make it comparable.  Also, your main point you made was cost related, so you're clearly not good at reading instructions...

If looking from math side of things:

18650 = π * 9^2 * 65 = 16540.48mm^3
21700 = π * 10.5^2 * 70 = 24245.24mm^3

So for 46% volume increase you get only 1Ah and 15A

so compared *S2P 30Q and *S1P 40T

xS2P 30Q = x * (2 * 16540.48) = x33080.96mm^3 = 6Ah 30A

xS1P 40T = x * 24245.24 = x24245.24mm^3 = 4Ah 30A

2P 30Q is 36% larger volume than single 1P 40T and you gain 50% more capacity than 40T so math explains really clearly why 2P 30Q is much better than 1P 40T it's more efficient in volume and capacity than any other cells


P.S. don't blame me if my math skills is bit out dated :D

No your math is solid, but that would mean I'd need to essentially double my cells, and I'm trying to keep this a single stack, and as small as possible.  Running 4WD with just a 12s4p/12s5p of 30Q's I imagine would be rather under powered compared to the same setup with the 40T.  Yes it is smaller, but only enough to where if I was running a 12s4p, then maybe I could squeeze it up to a 12s5p.  Showing the area of these cells is helpful, but it doesn't take into account the wasted space that isn't getting used since they're circular...  That's basically what I'm trying to say and why I believe that for the space and weight, the 40T would be the best performing cell for me.

I'm planning on using one of Hummies decks, and routing it out a bit to make some extra room in the enclosure, then possibly reinforcing it with a layer of CF or fiber glass.

Even if you account for the wasted space 30Qs give you more Wh/mm^3 than 40Ts
The optimal packing for circles is the hexagonal packing which offers a density of 0.9069 (Wikipedia).

So it is only a factor you apply whatever is the size of the cell.

I tried to do this with a 10s2p made of 26650 cells that where rated for 60a and it didn't work.
The voltage sag was very bad.
The cells I used had great specs but no track record.
I wasted money and a lot of effort on that venture.
So I turned to Lipos with 60C rating and had much better success.
So for a compact short range high discharge battery, I think that Lipos are still the best choice.

Most builders who want long range and longevity use 30Q's because they have been proven to outperform there specs.

- 4wd should draw less (R * I²)
- your battery max was 30A at 12S per focbox? (120/4)
- when i drive my r2 (10S4P 30Q) 2wd i have no problems. My battery max is 30A per focbox

I cannot imagine that a hub will have problems in a 4wd setup…
Why did it not work with your batteries? You have two more Motors and the same battery max amp?

If you don't give a shit about money
If you can eliminate the Z axis by routing into your deck and not weaken it.
If your enclosure's better optimised for 21700
If you feel you really need that much discharge.
If you can be sure voltage sag wont be a problem with your 40T pack. yeah you will be the beta tester.

If your NESE modules are certified for what? 5P * 30A = 150A (I would be surprised if they're not hot @ 40A, but of course yours will be custom)

Essentially that.  Since space is quite limited, I want the most powerful cells that'll allow me to run my 4WD hubs at max power, with minimal sag, and I'd hope for a range of art least 20 miles.  I'm not trying to make a super portable Penny board or anything, I think that's obvious.  I do want a very powerful board, but I don't want it to end up weighing like 30-40ish pounds like the Master Evo build with 13s5p of 30Q's.  With the enclosure cover in designing it should look just like a normal longboard, just a bit thick... That's the plan at least :smile:

To get the full performance regardless of the range you should stick to lipos. the only cells that can Output enough and can be used in a 1P configuration to save weight

Well I am not sure exactly, depends on the roads and what types of tires I'm running, but I would like to have a top speed of around 35ish, and probably cruising speed somewhere between 15-25.  I can't really be more specific I haven't ridden an Esk8 in the city I'm at now.  If I was back in Houston, there's lots of good flat roads and bike trails everywhere, but not so much here...

I'm not sure you understand ( like I did when I started) the amount of torque under acceleration you will have with all four motors. You are going to be the limiting factor on the board, not the batteries.  These high battery amps you want to pull are mostly transient for under a few seconds because 0-35mph doesn't take but a few seconds.  Once you're safely cruising at 35, amp draw drops and even up steep hills it's not that high. 

Which is why we keep pointing you to 30q batteries because you get more for your money.

Lipo will give you the most power for space, probably more amps than necessary.  If space/power is your primary concern this is your best option.  Don't buy crap lipos though.

Maybe it's about time you start a build log thread.  You can have all your questions contained in one spot. Plus once you start adding your intended parts all of us can get a better idea of what you're doing and better assist you.  That would be helpful.

I built a12s6p of 30q for my board.  I've managed to pull about 118a from the battery.  It only happens for a half a second.  But I'm more interested in the range because on a48" deck I've got room for days.

Now I understand that when you get to 6p, you also have much less voltage sag, as well as it extends the life of your battery pack quite a bit.  If I had the space to do a 12s6p I would likely go with the 30Q, but I think the largest I can do is 12s5p...  How about the Sanyo NCR20700A at 3100mAh and 30A for about $6/cell.  That seems like a reasonable compromise...?

I am running 8 x 3S 6Ah 65C Lipo from HK Graphenes ones, they cost a lot but they don't sag at all even at low voltages they still deliver their power like its nothing but prices are high for evo I thought I will use 8 x 6S 6Ah 65C ones but the total price is like 800£ So I am thinking of using maybe 30Q with like 10P minimum one problem I see is low charging C compared to lipos as I am able to charge them with 5C without even warming them up :)

What’s the cutout size of the @Hummie deck? Isn’t it 590x140x15? A 12s5p of 21700 batteries would be 30 cells long by 2 cells wide. That’s 690x140! You’d need to make the area 100mm longer and 10mm wider. But that barely leaves enough space for the battery, let alone the esc and VESCs. @Mikenopolis only has a 12s3p of 30q in his board.

As I am not restricted to dimensions of existing enclosures I am still thinking, a lot of stuff will be needed to be adjusted like my modular bms as the splitting in groups will be bit hard compared to lipos. But 30Q is definitely cheaper ;)

Regarding dimensions there is battery selector in HK page ;)

That's the correct dimensions, but I don't plan on orienting them that way.  I plan on having 6 rows of 8 or 10.  So 4/5 parallel group going up the length, then at the top row, run the series bridge all the way over and then the other 4/5 of each row going in series, to make a 12s setup so that is 70*6 is 420mm + 60mm bms + 2(77mm) ESCape 156mm, so that's 636mm, that's just an extra 46mm that needs to be routed out.

That's figuring 2x700, so if it was 18650, that would be 606mm, or an extra 16mm needed to be routed out.

That might work. If you orient them that way then you will need to make the pack flexy. So add at least 5mm between each series connection.

I’d think that by adding 2 more motors, 2 more VESC and the fact the fact that a 12s5p of 21700 or 20700 will weigh more than the 13s5p of 18650. Given you don’t have those heavy 107mm wheels. I’d guess this will be just as heavy if not heavier.

If I do go with 30Q's, then I would make the enclosure large enough to fit 12s5p.  That's just 20mm from each side.  I think as long as I reinforce it with fiber glass or CF then it should be ok.  I'd prefer 12s6p with the 30Q's, but I think I'd be good with 5p.

Think about this for a second. @psychotiller enclosure for that deck is 15mm deep. So 30mm of space inside. @bigben wanted to make his 10mm deep so 25mm of space. He also said that he would design a double stack version. If it was 20mm, giving you 35mm of space, that should be enough to double stack 18650. Then you could easily fit a 12s6p if whatever cell you’d like with the enclosure only being 10mm thicker.

My 12s3p decision was made just because it was an existing pack I already had, with a little neater wiring and BMS position I might've been able to fit more cells? The next build with another deck might be a AT board so I'll probably do with a larger stagger pack with a thicker enclosure.

@Mobutusan posted a picture with some cells in the deck here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-wood-and-carbon-decks-group-buy/43245/62

With that in mind, this will give you an idea of how much space I used/wasted for wiring, splitter, switch, BMS, BT module etc.![cb487545914220dbefad3537f022bfc56f763197|375x500](upload://eYLXQU6XFd0ylDMZdn5DDR3QWJs.jpg)

you'd think I would take a picture of it considering how many times it's been opened up. Nothing 

Here's a screenshot from a video I recorded when I was running into issues. The yellow bit at the bottom is the end of my "pack", the BMS is there. That mess of wires can be cleaned up. If you decide to put your LCD, switch and charge port on the flat side of the enclosure instead if the edge like me, there's is really no room left.

The 30Q is underrated at 15A. Look at the discharge curve here, you'll see that at 20A the capacity is the same as at 15A. Everyone rates the real world continuous draw of the 30Q at 20A: ![image|690x340](upload://7DnA0mdmEYkYyHFWUmRuOt5WkgO.jpg)

The 40T discharge curve at 30A continuous:
![Samsung 40T CC Tests|690x340](upload://897dRSjGy21KMReEczMC3r76Tlb.jpg)

Both batteries have reduced capacity at their respective 20A/30A draws. The 30Q is at 2550mah and the 40T at 3500mah.

The temperature of the 40T at 30A is 77C, while the 30Q at 20A is 83C. While the 30Q is 6 degrees hotter, its within operating tolerance.

So the 40T gives a 50% increase in continuous current draw, but only a 33% increase in capacity, at a 46% increase in volume, but at 37% increase in cost. The 40T loses in every metric except current draw - where it's just about equal to the 30Q. By simply increasing the number of 30Q cells by 46%, you get a 46% increase in capacity vs 33% and same current draw.

You said no cost, but a 30Q build will also save you 37% vs equivalent 40T build. It outperforms the 40T, is cheaper, you can actually buy it and there's support for 18650 everywhere.

[quote="uigiroux, post:25, topic:55450, full:true"]
Actually I’m very good at math.  This topic has been discussed a lot, but it usually goes along the lines of trashing all cells but the 30Q, and saying how all others are over priced for what they are.  NESE are for 18650 but I spoke to the owner and he said he could make them for larger cells.  Ok so why exactly are 30Q’s better than the 40T in a 12s4p/12s5p?  They’re 3000mAh and 15A, the 40T is 4000mAh and 30A.  For the amount of space, and ignoring cost, how does a 30Q out perform the 40T in a 4WD build, or even a 2WD build?   Just facts please?
[/quote]

If you ignore cost, it changes everything.

I [asked you above](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/samsung-30t-or-40t-12s4p-4wd-better-for-esk8/55450/9?u=b264) what you wanted, but you never answered.  You seem set on using the 40T no matter what, so do it!  Use them!

They are lighter than either one of those, but if you're optimising for lightness then the MJ1 is better

While I want the board to be as light as possible, I'm ok with the cells weighing more if they have the good specs to justify it.  I'm only going 12s5p at most though, probably 4p actually, so I want the battery pack to not be super heavy.  That's also why I'm not double stacking it.  Want the enclosure to be barely noticeable.

Is this your first build btw? It kinda sounds like it is but i don’t wana assume...
Edit: and if this is your first build, depending on how long you’ve been riding i don’t think going 4wd is your best bet tbh. In DIY no matter how much planning goes in, things will go wrong, the more you have the more there is to go wrong. This is Les sa daunting for an experienced builder but if it’s your first, you will be thoroughly frustrated and out of a whole lotta bucks. Now, I’m saying you should maybe go for more conventional components as it would make your life much easier. Have you thought about how the many components you’re looking at interact with each other? 
Just saying, it seems like you’re overloading yourself with this build, but maybe work up to it with smaller builds. Of course, this is all if this is indeed your first build.

I will revive this thread a bit with an ongoing choice for batterys.
I'm limited by the 4p count in my future board, it will be a 12s battery in a slightly higher end build.
I can go either 20700 route or 18650 and money wise I have no issues. 40t seems to be the best thing to use in my case, nkon atm has a good price on them, any reason not to choose them? I don't see an option of building a higher amp and bigger cappacity pack from any other cell out where. Will be used with pnaumies and most likely 6380 motors.

I really like the samsung 40T.
I made a 'small' board with a 10S2P battery and get around 20km.
This dual hub esc pulls max 24A and the pack has exactly the same voltage sag as my previous 10S4P with 30Q cells when pulling 24A.

Both packs costs the same but you get much more range with the 10S4P 30Q of course.
