As the title says, how often do you turn off your board? I usually leave my board on for weeks at a time, almost never turning it off. Can that cause problems?

I don't get how is it bad? The only thing that's draining my batteries would be a bluetooth module and 2 lights for the vesc.

I drained my pack dry by leaving it on for 2 weeks. (A123 are tough!) Learned my lesson.

Vesc has a decent amount of drain just being on.

I step off my board at the end of a ride, and turn it off.

I kept it on for a while once and noticed it dropped in voltage just over a few hours. I said 'nope not again'

You risk dropping cells below their empty voltage, which is especially bad if youre running lipos. At a low enough voltage, even a few days with low power consumption of vescs/bluetooth modules is enough to cause cells to drop to harmful levels given the steep drop off on the voltage curve.

If you really want to test this, run your cells empty till theyre at 3.4v and leave your board on. Tell us how long it takes for cells to get unbalanced or drop below 3.0v.

I turn it off every time i dont use it, i had a board turned on once for more then a few days.

The entire battery was below the limit so i had to get all cells charged up again before the BMS would charge the pack, i never do that again.

that seems extremely excessive.. well unlike most of you, i will give this a test in the name of science to see how bad the drain actually is.

you can call it stupid, but i'm doing this in the sake of science and weight reduction, no power switch + b.s mosphets that don't even work means i save time and money if it eventually fails, and i always charge it to full anyway so not like i'm one of those guys that will leave it on for 2 years and never check it or use it.

how do you leave a board on for a few days without charging it or even using it..

I ride eboards every day. can't go one day without it.

so you def. need a power switch.

what a terrible terrible example.

it's more comparable to like leaving a monitor in standby always.. sure there is a risk the monitor can have some plasma burn, but what if it isn't a plasma TV, what if it's so efficient that nothing goes wrong.

oh well, that's my hope..

if the voltage doesn't drop more than .5v/day (which still seems like a lot) i won't bother with a power button.

Also, something much harder to test is longevity of the battery. if the battery is constantly draining, even slightly, then the battery will most likely fail sooner. You would probably save money by adding a power switch in this case.

you're just evading the question, not answering it.

do you unplug every single electronic in your home at night in fear that it might fail and catch fire too?

cause some people do the same thing with fans. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_death)

what do you gain from having a switch, it seems highly unnecessary. and other eboards have done away with them.. like the inboard m1. 

basically the point is to make it as simple and clean as possible and lower the chance of anything failing/going wrong. if the switch consistently fails then i don't see a point for them, you wouldn't buy a lock for your home if it constantly gets stuck and won't let you in... would ya?

.. where is the source for that?

cycles diminish battery life sure, but once again, no one here knows how much exactly the electronics on a board will consume.. it's negligible at best since actually using the board will diminish the battery life WAY more then a switch ever will.

anyhow, i'm being quite repetitive. I guess i'll update with results soon, if it worked you'll know, if it doesn't i'll hide and cower away like a sewer rat. :smile:

Like I said previously, I have monitored my board for 4 days while leaving it on, and it did drain all the way to 0%. Your board might somehow be way more efficient then mine on stand-by, so you will have to check that out for yourself. 

Asking for a source? Yet you even said yourself that "cycles diminish battery life". Not sure if a source is really needed.

not many people wake up and think about there esk8 I know I don't
and I  often on short notice have to make some large trip,
which then after I'm drained and jump straight to bed.

And if the cycle continues My batteries that are at 3.4 can drop very fast and get unbalanced

Edit: I never leave my lipos at 3.4V I'm just trying to prove a point LoL.

Source for this statement 

"if the battery is constantly draining, even slightly, then the battery will most likely fail sooner."

seems like utter shit, no way it slowly draining is worse for cells then getting the cells really hot during rides.. as they usually get.

so show me a source where slowly draining batteries will destroy it, if anything it's the opposite as heat is what diminishes battery life most.. and slow draining would mean no heat.

Well that’s enough tak and let some put the science where our mouths are shall we? 

For this experiment , you should test your board averagely (multiple times) 

Condition A) Single Motor (1 ESC) 

Condition B Dual Motor (2 ESC) 

Condition C) Single Motor + BT Module (1 ESC + BT MOD)

Condition D) Dual Motor (2 ESC + BT MOD) 

Condition E) Single Motor + BT Mod w Phone BT Off

Condition F) Dual Motor + BT Mod w/ Phoen Bt Off 

Conditons E & F will serve as a control group? to see if the BT drains more energy if it has an existing connection with a device (condition C and D) or if it drains more energy searching for that connection. 

The existence of the single and Dual motor test are just to ensure that a full set up is tested. 

For each trial the boards must be at 100% charge

Yeah slowly draining them still creates more heat than not training them at all. No matter how you look at it it batteries have a limited cycle count, and no matter how slow you drain them it still reduces cycle life. Sure it's less hard on the cells than doing high amperage pulls.

I recently linked in Martin's post about auto on/off from an eneloop conversation the only thing taking power when idle is the LEDs and quiessent current of the arm chip in the vesc.  From the eneloop forum a few guys who tested said it was about 20-25mA (I'm assuming they were on 10S or so).  You can easily measure this with a multimeter to see how much it drains when idle, while it's not significant enough for me to go along with the auto off idea I still unplug my board when I get home, there's just no good reason to keep it on and out wear on the batteries for nothing.  I take out the loop key to turn it off and throw the loop key in my helmet with the remote, when I want to go I plug in the loop key and flick the switch on the remote this isn't digging into my time really (probably spent more time writing this than I have plugging and unplugging an xt-90.

Correction meant endless loop forum not eneloop I mix up that battery company and forum all the time.

that's not a fair comparison, as that uses way more energy then a few electronics being on..

let me ask you this.. do you leave your fridge on when not in use? how about your clock.. does that stay on?

why? you turn off your clocks to conserve energy.

there has to be a line, and if the electronics don't consume enough energy then there is no reason not to leave it on especially if you're like me and use the thing literally everyday.

but ok, just add a button/switch that will eventually fail, not my problem. :wink:

putting a laptop to sleep is the perfect example..

when it's in sleep mode it's not being used much, and thus barely drains.

i always put my laptop in sleep mode, and that gives me about -1% per day. AT MOST.

easier to deal with then having to reboot everything and lose all my work.

Right but we don't gain anything from what I gather from leaving the esk8 on I get it for convenience and quick start on the laptop.  What's the loss with using an XT-90 loop key.  I'm just failing to get the advantage of always on board.

.. it's like having a xt-90 loop key in car/ on my laptop.

looks ugly and destroys the A E S T H E T I C i'm going for.

also.. it prevent the issue of the switch failing in the first place.

I had a eBoosted button and a LHB mosphet and they both failed.. so.. no thanks. that's 55$ gone already.. 

i'd prefer always on and just have a smaller chance of things going wrong.

@Deckoz integrated an antispark switch using bullet connector and 3d printed mechanical parts. More aesthetically pleasing than loop key. If the vesc incorporated an auto shut off, then this wouldn't be an issue. But you're proposing to not include an important safety device for the sake of looks. I get that you're very focused on your skate. But heaven forbid something happens in your life that prevents you from being near your eskate for whatever reason, wouldn't you want to have a way to isolate the batteries from all load? How many videos do you need to see of batteries going thermal before you realize the potential energy stored and how dangerous that can be if not handled with care. Do what thou want @never4getf150forums, most on this forum are trying to help you prevent messing up bad.

Has there ever been 1 instance where someone took their loop key off during thermal runway and it prevent the battery from getting damaged?

that seems about the same as closing all the windows/doors of a house on fire in order to prevent the fire from getting oxygen... will it technically do something.. sure, will it stop a thermal runway or a battery fire.. doubtful.

Don't think anyone is saving packs from thermal runaway but loop key is good if your transmitter or receiver start acting wonky and decide not to go idle or brake when you need to stop. Basically don't want to end up flying through an intersection out of control because I don't like the look of a loop of wire.  Only place I see it really helping with preventing fires is stopping one from over discharging and then attempting to charge cells that have gone over the voltage cliff.![15310560854111046814893223031373|666x500](upload://ehx9WMB1xhIrmWDh2ehFzOUMqon.jpg)

Measurement with my custom receiver hooked up and the newer metr Bluetooth module.  26.34 mA in case it's hard to read.

On my battery this means if I had it fully charged at 5000mAh it would be 200 hrs or about 8 days of idle before it would be entirely drained and I would have wasted one cycle on the batteries.  To put it another way every 8 days you are losing a cycle just from idle power... You have roughly 300-500 cycles per cell so would take 2400-4000 days or about 10 years if all the cells did was idle and get recharged but given you are riding daily I imagine that means recharging every day as well in which case you probably really only have a year (maybe 2 if you recharge every other day) before the cells will be under 80% their original capacity. The drain every 8 days means in a year you lose about 45 cycles just from idle power.  In two years with that loss you've sacrificed 90 of 300-500 cycles or 1/5-1/3 of the usable cycles have been wasted.

Granted above numbers are all run with my relatively small battery.

Once people have had some hands on time testing these and they're proven I might be more inclined but XT-90 loop key or antispark bullet are pretty safe options in terms of not failing or doing something unexpected (my loop key hasn't once tried to jump out or plug itself in and when I take it out the circuit turns off every time)

Not a good argument - xt90s have failed (see @whitepony) and are not as bullet proof as you want them to be. Also this thread is not about which switch is the best but convince @never4getf150forums to use one.
So if it makes @never4getf150forums use a switch the push to start one will be better than nothing.

Well I'm not arguing for Xt-90s just the most reliable solution in my mind right now.  Didn't see the issue white pony had but only issue I've personally experienced with them is when I didn't plug it in all the way to the high current draw went through the resistor in the start of the plug and it fried in there (had to use pliers to yank it out).

If it turns out Martin's thing is ultra reliable and never fails after people have been reporting back for a year or I've had my own hands on time I can report about with it I just don't want to suggest it (no offense intended)

I am trying to get it as close to perfect as possible, but of course the true test will be the first batch to ship out.

And I understand how important it is to make it reliable, since some want to use the switch without any push button at all. I will do my best to test the switches as much as I can, the last thing I want is to be responsible for someones board to break or get damaged.

Nice, someone with numbers.

My thoughts on this subject, based only on your testing:

If you actually ride your board every day and use a small lipo you could still be treating it better by turning it off when not riding it. The drain when not riding the board won't affect your range by that much though. If you have some hugeass batterypack like 30q 10/12s 3/6p the drain shouldn't be noticeable at all anymore. Also the cycles of your battery don't matter anymore. It would take decades to wear it out.

What I would be more afraid of is the electronics wearing out. I don't think  the most esc's are made to be always on.

I'd agree with most of what you said.  I should add I have a 10S battery so 25mA x 10 x 4.2 = 1050mW or 1.05W about 1W so looking at it in terms of Wh I have a 185Wh battery so can run for about 185 hrs idling if full and basically lose 1Wh per hr out of the battery.  If you are at 12S the idle amperage should be lower probably where the 20mA figure on the other forum came from (and or lack of receiver/telemetry).

Regarding the electronics it's just the arm processors running when you're getting an idle signal and I don't think it would be an issue.  Not sure what cpu utilization looks like on the vesc really but imagine it isn't super stressed.

Normally after every ride I turn it off. And if I leave it for more than 3 days I also un-plug my voltage alarm. 

But just last week I left it on for 36 hours as I forgot about it. Inlaws visited for the weekend. Two out of 12 cells where at zero volts. F*&^%!

There most likely has never been a thermal runaway with the loopkey removed and the board not in use. I view the loopkey more as a measure to isolate the battery from all potential load for safe storage. It's a preventative measure rather than a reactive one. Anyhow, gl with your builds brother.

it'll take about 35 days to completely drain my 10s5p 30q pack.

that's 1 cycle a month, 12 charge cycles/year lost out of about 1,000 cycles total.

i plan to replace my battery at least once every 2 or so years for the next best cell. so it won't be much of an issue.

"Don’t think anyone is saving packs from thermal runaway but loop key is good if your transmitter or receiver start acting wonky and decide not to go idle or brake when you need to stop. Basically don’t want to end up flying through an intersection out of control because I don’t like the look of a loop of wire."

would this happen even with a gt2b? i thought this sorta problem was only prevalent on cheap remotes that you have to manually reset/re-trigger after every start.

If the wrong pin comes loose from the wrong component pretty much anything can happen depending on which pin on which component.  I've generally heard positive things about the gt2b but I don't have personal experience with it.  In the transmitter the trigger could mechanically break or the potentiometer or hall sensors used for detecting position could have problems that develop over time or come from changes in environmental factors around the components between calibration and usage.  The receiver can have pins come loose from the RF chip and the main mcu on the receiver may or may not be programmed to handle any given pin on the RF chip coming loose.  

Have personal experience with things going wrong while developing my own remote so there's definitely good reason for me to not trust them.  That said even if you are using a known good remote there are lots of things that can go wrong not to mention most of our parts are customized or custom made (one offs without much testing)

Basically nothing is full proof, but having some sort of emergency cut off button or loop key on anything with this much power and remotely controlled still makes sense to me even with a ginormous battery.

To actually test out this theory you would need more than 1 board to have anything statistically relevant.

Your board will probably be fine. It's just more risks and we won't learn anything from 1 board not breaking while always being on. Buy another 100 and we can talk!

I am curious how this can happen? I have not personally tested the BMSes I have access to but I thought they shut off at low voltage like 29V for 10S I believe. I am working on a BMS I think will be superior hopefully and it has all these cut offs and features so I am quite surprised that such a basic thing is not implemented?

I used a tiny BMS for charging only and also 3.3V per cell is quite low for lipo that's why it drained down to 0.87V per cell within 28 hours only (2 vescs connected). The turnigy graphene's were puffed and dead.

Now I use a Bestech BMS for discharge/charge with a custom over-discharge protection at 3V per cell, that's the highest value they can set. That should at least safe lipos from total destruction.

With custom I mean Bestech can adjust some settings within a certain range e.g. over discharge detection and release voltage between 2.3V and 3V per cell. If you look at Bestech homepage you'll see the data sheets have some values marked in red, they are adjustable.

going on 2 weeks, so far no issues, the battery drain from being always on is about .4v ~ .5v every 12 hours.

I use this thing every day, and I have quite a big hill from where I start, usually after a full charge and when I get the chance to use the board it's at around 41.8v, perfect so I have some room to brake after going down this hill and not worry about over-voltage disconnect/cutoff from braking with a full battery.

my plan is to check each cell inside and make sure they're all good aroundabout every 4 weeks, last thing I want is an unbalanced cell.. 

so far.. so good. fingers crossed.
