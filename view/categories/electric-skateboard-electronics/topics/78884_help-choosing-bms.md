Currently building my first from scratch build and was wondering what kind of a  BMS would be the best for my build. Im gonna use N.E.S.E module for a 12s4p pack with samsung q30 cells and FocBox unity with 6354 190kv motors

This one is very popular at the moment for it's small form factor and Bestech is well regarded:

I would not suggest that BMS as it seems to lack balancing.

He mentioned charge only

I am pretty sure he wants balancing too.
Most people here differentiate BMS into charge only and discharge types but almost all want balancing.

I'd also advise against one that doesn't balance

This one doesnâ€™t balance? What does it do as a bms??

Stop the charge when it reaches the preset value when charging.

edited the post im kinda running low on energy so didnt read what i wrote completely, yes im looking for both charge and discharge bms. Was gonna put that charge only bms prob isnt the best option.

(im shit at typing sry for fuck up)

That doesn't look like the one you're using. It has an integrated switch. Need your exact model

Add some balancing boards, bestech makes some absolutely tiny ones

I can now recommend a charge and discharge bms. I just overdischarged 2 Lipo cells yesterday due to now low voltage cut off
```

Thats why I have a lipo alarm on very single pack.
If one cell gets too low than others iâ€˜ll get a notification even if not reached the total cut off voltage.

this is why i don't like charge only. you can't cut out when theres a faulty cell it just keeps running

I used to but itâ€™s a pain to have them connected as you can switch it off

thatÂ´s right!
If you have them in an enclosure itÂ´s not practical at all.
i can just open my top mount lipo box and take them out or attach them.

I personally went for the D140. It seems many have had good results with it and it is thin so you will probably find somewhere to put it.

Let me know if you find out ðŸ˜…
Till now I donâ€™t see that this would be smaller than a usual bms. Only thing is that you can get higher balance currents.
