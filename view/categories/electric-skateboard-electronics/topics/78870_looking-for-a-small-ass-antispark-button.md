I'm in the midst of building a board with limited space. Most antispark switch buttons that I know of, is usually very long and takes up some space in the enclosure. I'm looking for a button or a whole antispark switch that is low profile like the unity's switch. I believe it's a momentary switch. ![20181218_214036|690x388](upload://2YlMruLUxzGdmWyunsZWEAYOIq3.jpeg)

I've been looking too but just couldn't really find one.... The only LP switch I have is the enertion etray, I just used the whole etray as a antispark in my build

Do you have a pic of it? And does enertion sell them by any chance? Or is it discontinued and hard to come by

Looks like if you removed all the shrouding and what not it might be similar to the space cell system they used to use, which probably has more documentation..... might be a place to start

Or you could incorporate the whole etray into the build, as the etray uses a 11 pins bms

Momentary switch is easy to find https://pl.aliexpress.com/store/product/12MM-Metal-Button-Switch-Flat-Ultra-short-Reset-Electronic-Smoke-Button-Small-Button-Stainless-Steel-Waterproof/4208011_32875882448.html?spm=a2g17.12010615.8148356.3.2d5ea0bb0yhmIZ

I need one for Bestech BMS and I need self latching one which is impossible to find in that small form factor :(

Shameless plug, but my antispark mosfet switch is about as small as they get and they have worked very reliably for me and many others. Attached are some pics, PM me if your interested. Dimensions: 33x22x11

I made my long one shorter by removing the shroud and soldering the wires direct onto the back of the switch - can be seen here.

Yea seems like a thin momentary switch would be best. But i'll have to see which button would work with the flipsky antispark. I currently have that and the antispark PCB is the smallest i have. 

But their button is so god damn long

It is open source lol, I meant to post the link to the post about it, but I forgot. 
EDIT: Just realized the Eagle files are not up to date so I will upload latest ones tonight.
EDIT #2: Post #23 on my thread has the updated Eagle files.
