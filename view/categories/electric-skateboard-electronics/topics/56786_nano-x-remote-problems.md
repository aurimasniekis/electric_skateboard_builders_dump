nano x flashes green twice then pauses then flashes twice again when connected to reciever. Never becomes a solid light. When riding it suddenly cuts out. And it's brand new.

Did you try to rebind it? I suspect you maybe did. If you just bought it then perhaps @EnertionSupport or @barajabali can help you out. It should be covered under warranty. You should prepare a video of the issue to show them to speed things up.

That sounds like the exact behavior for low battery. Try charging it?
