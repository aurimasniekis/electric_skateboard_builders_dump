Just as the title says.....

In reference to my last post (http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-shows-no-leds-or-usb-funtion-but-powers-reciever-after-being-connected-by-can-bus/14841)

I can't seem to track down the issue with this controller, and also can't seem to get any further input on that last thread for more help with troubleshooting.

I'd hate to have wasted the cash on that controller, and am not really enthusiastic about buying another one from them (so that the hardware would match, allowing dual via can) given their shoddy manufacture and quality control.

I am in the process of repairing a DRV chip for a guy in NZ. If you figure out the problem I may be able to solder a fresh component on for you.

EDIT: Just realised that you have a hot air station. Probably not worth me fixing it if you have one.

I'm certainly not an expert at using the hot air station, but every time I use it the end product is better than the last....

Its more the figuring out whats wrong with it that i'm having troubles with.|

Thanks for the offer anyway though.

Hey lox897 any chance you'd be interested in doing another DRV chip repair/replace. I'm pretty sure I've blown mine due to my phase wires shorting accidentally. If so any chance you could send some dets and pricing? Cheers mate

Hey mate, I've only done one repair and it didn't turn out well at all haha. Don't have the time nor the money right now to invest in some good solder paste or tools. @JohnnyMeduse might be able to help you.
