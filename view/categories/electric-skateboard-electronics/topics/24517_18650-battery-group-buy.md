Didn't grab any yet so I am in too!

30q is good for me as well.
Onepunch, the premium for the 30q is worth the extra capacity. Price would be 4.95 a cell. If we all ordered 40 each than the shipping would come to 41.02USD

Where is everyone located?

I am in Caledon, but commute to toronto for work.

i actually ended up buying mine alone from nkon.com because the price was great and bulk discounts only took of like $10 or $20. But i might be doing another order of 30qs from nkon if anyone wants to join in

@Conor and All - group buys can only be arranged by L3 members. We established this policy to reduce risk to members who join group buys. Thanks.

I saw this rule but in this case it seems that would leave us SOL unless you have a suggestion?

@killahbee @Conor you can ask a more senior\L3 member to organize the buy, or you can hang out here a bit longer and you'll eventually be L3 yourselves. If you are just coordinating between a few people you can take it "offline." We've had a few group buys go badly and we're trying to help protect everyone.
