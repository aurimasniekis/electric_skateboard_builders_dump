Do you mean when you start from stand still ? 

I mean if you give it a little push does it work ? 

also from a fast look on Alien's page they say : MAX VOLT: 10S. Idk tho should be fine with 12 probably :-??

Also post some screenshots from the bldc tool with motor config

60kV is extremely low, even for a hub motor. What kind of gearing are you using?

I currently have the system on a ebike with 9t on the motor , it's cogging even if I pedal with the motor , I have a problem that the vesc disconnects from PC when the motor is working and I can't do a proper motor detection ,(I want to make it sensored so it can work perfect without cogging or any other issues but APS 63mm hall sensors are out of stock üòïüòï

if you disconnect the pulleys the motor is working ok or still not working ?

You have to get through the motor detection. 
It is not optional. 
Check your phase wires. You may have a bad connection. A cold solder joint is all it takes.

I'm surprised no one mentioned sensors. This sounds like normal behavior for a sensorless setup. You just gotta kick push when you start up.

It does have the power to move you, it just can't negotiate the rotor position since you're not running sensors.

Post up more of your board specs 

Without knowing them, I blindly suggest you bump up your motor current settings.  90A motor max will give you much better startup torque

 The problem must be in the motor connection , it diassembly the ebike kit and hold the motor with the vesc connected ( mounted not with bare hand) the motor worked for a few minutes ive done the motor detection and i was using the keys *D ,I ,RPM* just to see if it works , i stop and after i went to press the RPM button again and i saw a spark i diassebly the motor but i didnt manage to find any burn , and now its back to the same it makes a tiny sound and still does not move . :/ im tired of that :/  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/8/38c8eee4a22924fa858202ba3d4ed727d28b7b19.png" width="690" height="387"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/e/6e7a8d508881f88fd6e1948c85e187002be5eb4b.png" width="690" height="387">
