ok guys i need some help here. bit unsure whats best.

everyone seems to be using 3000mah 15A 30Q correct?

mate of mine builds paks and repairs for eBikes. he said because i am gonna use
2x 6384s 4000watt
(12s4p)

i should order the 18650 samsung-25r 2500mah 20A

so what 18650,s should i order?
the 20A are cheaper from nkon.nl (144ish)
the 15A are 184euro for 50piece

any help would be great

I'd say 30q but I've basically completed my board and have ridden it a couple times but I feel like I'm not getting the range I want. I'm using samsung 30q batteries in 10s2p and am getting around an estimated 6km max? That just doesn't seem right to me. According to the battery module I use I cannot charge the board past 87% which might be the start of the problem. If anyone has any idea on what to do to fix this or any ideas whatsoever please let me know

not charging past 87 sounds like a bms issue... could be a charger issue but less likely... a few of my packs all tend to stop at 99% (as per my LCD meter), u should get like 16km max on agressive riding if my math is right

So the 30q just come out better in the bench tests bassicly correct?
And 90% are using them
Was just worried that the 6384s 4000wat wpuld be to much for the 30q as i have 0 experience with them

Ask yourself if your controllers can handle more...
Now a days I see everybody going bigger and bigger...
For sure it’s nice to have big motors, but honestly, I guess most even can’t use 70% of the capability of there motors.
If there is a bottle neck somewhere you can’t get full performance.
So let’s look on the 6384 4000w motors
You run 12s, means 4000w/44,4v=90A
Don’t know which esc you use but for this you need one able to handle 90a constant.
90a constant for single motor, 180a for dual....
So to get the power you could get out of your board you need a battery, able to deliver 180a constant....
Sorry to say but a 12s4p is far away from this.
Even with a pack of VTC5A and 35A it’s still not enough

It doesn’t not have anything to do with safer.
Just more weight and more money to spend for no real effort.
Your battery pack should fit to your esc.
The motor for sure can handle the load.
Doesn’t matter if 6374 or 6384.
If you go dual focbox, limited to 40a constant for example than you need a better which can handle 80a constant.
Means 5-6p would be better than 4p 30q
Or you go 4p on vtc5a batteries.

And the 60a constantly the focbox can only handle if the cooling is perfect. Means as min mounted outside with good air flow.
If you interested there some heat sinks made from @Kug3lis which seams to help pretty  good with getting rid of the heat.

```
all the vescs you can adjust the current from the battery to the motor..the power.    so you could use any weak battery and lower the settings on the vesc but of course you dont want low power, but it starts with the battery and you need to chose one that can put out the current, power, you want.  look at the output of the 30Q and its really a 20 amps cell.  it can put out 20 amps continuously and not drop the voltage much or damage the cell getting it hot.  if you have 4 of them in parallel then you can do 4x so 80 amps.  there's power.   the motor doesnt decide the power ..you just hope its big enough that the power you send to it wont make it hot..so it needs to be big enough

With 12s you just can reach higher speed.
10s4p is very common too and even a bit safer as the focbox can handle up to 60v peak and with 12s you already run the focbox with 50,4v.
Just remember if you built a 10s4p pack than also buy a charger for 10s not 12s as it’s mention in the list

Nice torqy motors

10s4p will be a safer option for the focbox it seems
The 12s4p is just a bit to much?
The enclosure i wish to order is a 4p setup either 10s4p or 12s4p

And run 10s4p with the focbox. The motors are rated at 10s so think this will be a fair setup. Sound like a good call andy?

Yes for sure!
I was running 190kV on 11s Dual and it was a good board. With max speed up to 55km/h and nice torque.
You can run the alien motord also 12s just in case one day you want to upgrade.
It’s written 10s but 12s fine too.
I just ordered the same motors you plan to buy and will run them 12s.
To start with 10s is a good thing.
If you use a bms, look for one which you can set up to different S batteries and loads.
With it you can just update your 10s to 11or12s by simply add 1 or 2 packs of 4cells and buying a new charger.

![chrome|690x388](upload://sSE6F9Z7ymv9cunN6BEkrPXUT3w.png)
The 25R can maybe handle 20A better but they get a bigger voltage drop.
Your friend has 2 of these powerfull motors,
If you're going to make a 12S4P, he must really go for the Sony VCT6 cells. they can handle 30A continues with no problem. I'm sure these will give the most power with your 12S4P setup.

Charge and discharge are on the same place. 
It’s + and - from your battery.
Once you put energy inside, once you take energy out of it.
That’s logic, no?

Hey not trying to hijack @tricky-fpv thread but I'm about to install a new 12s4p 30q in my dual 6374 build and after some advice on settings  for dual focboxes.  The focboxes scare me a bit with their tendency to fry (already blown 2 canbus) and with the extra voltage I need to be careful.
What are good battery max settings per vesc that will utilise the extra power without causing meltdown?

Battery current I would set to +30a -10a for each for beginning.
If you have a app to monitor your ride than use it and look how hot your focboxes come. If they stay cool like under 60degrees than you can slowly rise up to max 40a.
With 4p 30q 80a it’s your battery max

Check out this switch
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/push-to-start-switch-out-now/60879/64?u=andy87
It’s a push to start switch with auto off function.
But this I think you need to fuse separate as it cut out only at 100a. 
Your pack will be 80a so your fuse should be the same value. There are different kinds of fuses. Which cut out faster or slower. I would go with a 80a fuse. If it’s slow blow 60a should be fine too.
But i‘m not a expert in it. Maybe somebody else can give his opinion about it too

## \#56 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2018-08-08T12:23:13.046Z Reads: 94

```

a fuse choice isnt related to how many amps the cells can put out and if you short it will be putting a lot more than the cells are rated for.   you want a fuse that can do at least what the cells can put out and then some.
there's more energy in the cell between 3.3 and 3.1 than 3.1 and 3.
the high voltage cut off is programmed by you on the vesc.  you want it high and leave the default alone probably safest as things will get higher than your battery voltage with braking spikes or maybe some other time.
if youre only able to charge to 4 volts its not necessarily bad. they cells will last way longer and if it gets you the performance you want ..

If you go with LiIon you can go with a lower battery cut off. 3v some people even go to 2.8v.
If you configurat your vesc like this you would get more range for sure (besides you don’t have a bms which already cut off at 3.5v)

![-8274025931318208117|600x484](upload://xhVmxYq2rFz1bBf4BiUObWqww9D.jpg) or could I connect it like this? (The wire from load would just go straight to the port not connect half way)![sketch-1534912630324|281x500](upload://du4S8vy7GIddNsda9sod1leG534.jpg)

It’s basically the same.
They just draw it like this as it’s more easy to understand.
Important that the charge and the load parallel to each other.
So you can just solder the wire for charge and discharge to your c-. No need for a small split wire.

Thanks man really appreciate it! Do you know of any type of good balancer/ charger for 18650. All my individual cells are messed cause my old BMS was absolute complete trash

no, not really.
I guess you don´t want to make your pack new, right?
If that wouldn´t be a problem, than just take apart every cell and charge or discharge them with a normal stock charger so that they all have the same voltage.

Yea I made a little charger thing cause I really don't want to spend a couple hundred to buy new cells. ![IMG_20180815_180801_015|281x500](upload://2pAQnvmw5WBMWJUWT9QZR5Elmip.jpg) but I was just wondering if there was one with fast shipping that I can just plug the cell in and leave it till it gets to 100 and then do the next one

Look in your local electro shop.
In mine they had a cheap 4 cell charger for 18650s

Yeh I think soldering a wire will be your best bet as these strips can only do 7A max at best, I think.

Though.. u will need strong flux / acid to get it to work.. at least i had real trouble soldering on nickel, not to mention on cells directly.

It can be done but is a bit tricky..

Also soldering iron with at least 60w is recommended, i think.

Or.. just find someone with welder but i guess at this stage it is not really viable

Up that to a 95W soldering Iron at least. Small soldering irons slowly raise the temp to melt point which has the problem of burning off the flux and the solder doesn't stick. The heat has more time to disperse into the cell with potential to damage the cell. High wattage iron will heat the area up quickly and the solder will stick before the flux burns off.

Yeh I guess that's the iron to get if there's no strong flux / acid available but soldering is still needed close to the cells
