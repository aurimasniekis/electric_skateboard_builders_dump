I know it varies from case to case but under the assumption that board is maximized for performance what would be the biggest limiting factor? Motors, Batteries, or ESC?

Unfortunately with traction, adding weight won't help you from sliding out. It'll just make your acceleration slower. If you want more traction then the answer is migrating away from smooth urethane towards textured vulcanized rubber wheels.

Bottleneck for why it's not more popular? Cost. We're in too early for the tech to be reasonably priced.

Bottleneck for me personally? Waterproofing and parts wearing out too fast.

The batteries are often the bottle neck. Having a battery that is capable of lots of amps as well as long range is not cheap, nor is it light weight. Currently Lipo is the best for power density but range wise it’s not great. On the other hand Li-ion is great for long distance riding but to get a large amount of power you require at least 8p just to overcome voltage sag, but at this point your board is like a lead brick

Well.. theres a liion for every application really. You can build a 10s2p sagless pack with 35a cells. I get what you're saying though, with 30q's being the most common cell at the moment there are limitations.

For a board to be sagless, do you just need to have a big discharge pack or do you have to configure vesc with high battery discharge also? I find that my 30q 10s5p sags like a bitch, wondering if has anything to do with vesc settings.

That's unusual. How old is the pack? When does it happen, early in the ride or in the last percentages? 

I'm not much of a battery buff at all but I have had two 10s5p 30q boards, I'm riding one of them right now and sag just doesn't exist. I've got down into the 20% region but never lower really.

Have you got any telemetry?

I would vote for batteries also.. Any 'decent' / high range battery (for mountainboard) comes close to 300-400 eur range

Power wise I think 3-4kw for 'general' riding is more than enough and vesc/motors can supply that amount of power without going and exploring new options.

So yeh.. as mentioned.. wallet and weight are the biggest factors.

If someone asks my extended opinion about mechanical parts, then it would be lack of cheap suspension system.. 

E-scooters get suspension much easier than eboards do..

Personally I think its the motors/power train.

Everything is a compromise with motors, and they're just so big, getting them to fit in setups and mounted you run into so many restrictions.

Direct Drive is Awesome, but hub motors are awful due to the restrictions of wheels and also the terrible urethane depth and lesser urethane quality.

Direct drive inline with wheels is incredible, But then you no longer have any room for an actual truck and your motors are very close to the ground.

Belt-chain drives get rid of some of those problems, but they have their own can of worms.

I gotta say reliability, especially in the motor and battery departments.

Motors take a lot of abuse being so close to the ground and depending on the use case can get overly hot or knock into something and shatter a magnet or damage a bearing. Batteries only last a few years of heavy use before decreasing in capacity and are not a very good investment imo.

Reliability is a big, ***huge*** problem, but it's currently solvable -- people just don't want to pay for it.

Battery weight is the biggest bottleneck that isn't solved yet.

If you had a choice to buy a $1000 new car that worked awesome for the first 5 miles but then breaks down, you wouldn't buy that.  But people think it's okay for esk8, for some reason.

There is [one company](https://forum./t/jed-boards-interview-what-are-they-doing-over-there/43) treating esk8 engineering as automotive engineering....  can't wait to see what they produce.

What exactly to we stand to gain from lighter batteries? They only amount to a small percentage of the overall vehicle weight so there wouldn't be any performance gain. The only thing we get from that is less muscles. Do you mean a greater energy density? that takes into account volume and then we can start cramming MAh onto boards and cruise from here to LA without a recharge

Really, I don't think most people here are going to be average users.

Advancements in batteries I don't think is really going to increase the number of people interested in spending their money Eskate.

I think for that its waterproofing, reliability, and lifetime and that sort of stuff.

Waterproofing is definitely very doable currently.  It's not really a bottleneck if you want to do it.

Although most folks confuse that with "water resistance" which is not the same thing.  Ideally, you have a moderate amount of water resistance and a very high amount of waterproofing.

Waterproofing is the one that matters after water has already gotten inside.  Because it *always* does, eventually.

The motor you have to use conformal coating on the sensor board and any low-voltage wiring.  It helps on the high-voltage phase wires and terminations, but isn't absolutely necessary.  It is absolutely necessary for the sensor assembly.

A sensorless motor is rather waterproof as-is.

Except bearings.... those will need replaced after a certain amount of time.

Not sure waterproofing the gear train matters.But for motors I think they already take a beating, it isn't like you're going to submerge the motors in the rain. My batteries have more problems in the rain than the motors, I think the bearings are the biggest problem in the motors in the rain.

For me, the biggest problem is traction. With 10kw under my feet, even with 78a urethane and 4wd, I can break traction. Now I do get decent traction... I was the only one to make it to the finals in the last evolve k1 race on urethane, and I blew away all of the pnuematics in the semi final race. It's just I couldn't ride the way I can on stooge wheels with 40 duro nitrile.

Batteries... well put together the right lipo pack like I did and you'll have 1200 wh, 1250 amps at 50.4v peak power draw. It's very doable and it doesn't have to be insanely heavy. With this battery, 4 focboxes, a bms, and 4 beefy hub motors, my board is still only 35 lb... Now I know you'll say that's a lot, but 20 lb is pretty normal for a 5 mile, tiny dual motor drive board. Compare that to derricks 50 lb trampa setup... It's reasonable and it can still be carried like a skateboard.

I agree that the major bottlenecks are battery/traction/safety. To me, traction and safety can mostly be overcome with better firmware in the motor controllers. There is no reason for any wheelslip with 4 sensored motors.  The current traction control firmware is very simple because it works decently, but improvements could be made to it that would significantly increase racing speed with 0 wheel slip.

@b264 I second that. Which is why I'm building it bigger and better, to get it wetter . Although I have to rethink my new prototype cuz last check was over 50lbs without the battery so... Yeah weight also. Although once I convert the design over to carbon fiber it should lighten up a lot. Which makes me want to ask this... Just how heavy is everyones batteries?

You guys know that boards are meant to be ridden and not carried right?

If you have a longboard you can drag your board (unless you have a pintail :rofl:) cause the tail won’t scrape and that essentially eliminates the weight

Put it in to eco, and you can do 100 miles on a single charge. Put in in to max mode and you can still do 25 miles and ride faster than anyone other than moe or @Lucifer, who are nuts lol.

When you consider the power and range and overkill in parts so things last, it's not really that much. There's only a handful of boards in the world with this kind of power and most are heavier than this.

I do all of the time... lol. I run to corner store to pick up rolling papers, luckys to get milk or eggs or toilet paper... or to hardware stores cause I ran out of hot glue. I can also use it to get to work downtown and back on a single charge... None of this "last mile" bullshit...

What's not practical is having cars aggressively ride your ass cause you can't accelerate as fast as they can... Or keep up with their speed on side roads, which is generally speaking the safest place for us to ride if you don't have trails... Having to go 25 mph on a 35 mph road where cars are doing 45 mph... That shit is dangerous. Going 35 mph behind the last car in the train is a lot safer.

You mention a grocery store... Well you can only carry so much in your hands anyways, since you need one hand to operate the remote. So it should always be a short shopping spree anyways...

What's interesting is everyone has a different outlook on practicality. Maybe if I were 120 lb guy, they yes, 35 lb is a lot. I'm not... I'm a 200 lb guy and 35 lb is not a heavy weight to me. I curl 45 lb in each arm in the gym lol. Not trying to brag or anything (cause 45 lb is still not much, lol), but just put things in to perspective. Different people have different uses and what's fast one is slow to another, whats heavy to one is not to another. To bring weight to down to 20 lb would mean putting a lot of weak sauce into my board which is a big no no to me.

Biggest pet peeve of mine when riding. Happens to me on this road maybe 25-35 zone (what speed I assume people usually go compared to me going full throttle) It has a pedestrian cross in the first 1/5th then a stop sign shortly after at 2/5ths then the last open 3/5ths of the road until a stop light. Where the stop sign is I have seen multiple people just run straight through it. When riding on the small stretch (first 2/5ths maybe) to the stop sign and through the pedestrian crossing some cars get up close behind me and just ride my ass since I am stopping them from speeding through the zone (since there is a stop sign up ahead it literally would only make like a 5-10 second difference in getting there if they sped without me in their way). It has me scared eventually someone behind me isn't going to be paying attention and slam into me. Hopefully one day I'll build a board that can keep them off my ass.

20lbs and 35lbs, your boards are pretty heavy guys ! Now for a 4wd I totally get it though...

A 12s4p of 18650 can be worth approx 5 to 6.5lbs by itself excluding cables, when you try to shave weight down that's already a handicap.

I'd vote for both traction, reliability, weight as bottlenecks and add _wobblity_.

Wobbles still are a thing and counter is done mostly by the rider's skill (which isn't a bad thing) + tweaking truck angles (very clever indeed).

Still that might not stop people to eat shit occasionally : wobbles + limited traction (read : random no traction) is likely to bring a fall.

I cannot say if there's a way to improve on the wobble area with trucks as they are, since the pivot and pu wheels are core parts in the "feeling". But it would be nice to have a little unintrusive help on that area.

For me it would component compatability and warranty related things. Coming from a former bike rider, I am used to lifetime warranty or 2 year no questions ask warranty. The first time I had to deal with esk8 parts warranty, I just could not believe it. also the second and the third time. Now, (it's only my opinion) if you have 3+ grand to spend, you can build a board with out any bottlenecks, a board that you will not gas out in one day and probably will not reach the max speed it can. I personally think, that if you have some money to spend, all of the majority of mentioned  bottlenecks can be avoided. This is a means of motorized transportation, weight I think, should not even be a question. if a motor brakes after hitting a rock, well it's just regular wear and tier.

Just being real, my friend.  If I park an esk8 outside, it will be the last time I ever see it.  A 24.4kg (54 lb) esk8 is essentially worthless to me.  I have one that's 34.2 lb (15.5 kg) and it's a nightmare carrying it.

At 24kg, you might as well have an ebike, because you still have to park that outside like a car, but it's easier to lock up.

I think a "bottleneck" like others mentioned is just a safe place to ride in the city. Or maybe even a "socially acceptable"... or "cool" place to ride in a busy city. Sidewalks have cracks and are too crowded anyways, wouldn't want to accidentally give someone a shinner.

Bike lane is almost the worst, I've lost track of the number of times a bicyclist has felt it important to share with me their delusion "the bike lane is for bikes". Which is odd, because the same person will get upset if a car thinks they own the road.

The middle of the road if there is no cars, that is of course the best but in a big city, that barely happens except at midnight.

Bike paths, or more appropriately put "mixed use" paths are where it is at.

Am I crazy for thinking about moving to a different city now after getting into esk8? One that has awesome bike paths everywhere?

Marketplace specific bottleneck: If you are building a board, you can get just about everything ordered "off the shelf" except for enclosures. That seems to be the part that requires you to go to a community builder or get creative. It's such a niche market though, and they any good enclosure should be fit to the deck anyways. So it's a challenge, but it's something I felt during my current build.

You just have to learn how to ride with traffic. Wait for them to catch lights.

Also, when you are going nearly as fast as them it is less of an issue.  But putting around sub 20mph in the road doesn't work to well.  But if you maintain speeds close to theres it is much easier.

Also, bikes do it just fine.  A big part of it is knowing your city and increasing your comfort level.

I’m pretty new to the esk8 world, working on first build. But first impressions? There is a terrible markup and price gouging going on in the esk8 world. Complete boards not so much, but some of the components are just silly. Motor mounts for >$60 per side is just crazy. Don’t buy into this 7075 aluminum crazy. That material is ridiculously expensive and unless you’ve got a top 5% power/ usage setup, it’s overkill only hurting your wallet. 
Same goes for gears. I love finding 3D printed gears for $30. Metal should be the only option if your soending $30 on a single pulley. 

This goes on and on. Standard longboard components like trucks, wheels etc are ok. Most of the esk8 components are way overpriced. Fortunately, the community has some members making components at much more fair pricing.

This is a byproduct of an industry in its infancy.

There just isn't a big enough market yet.  I don't mind paying because it needs to be worth it for innovators to innovate and then provide you a product.  If the prices aren't high enough with relatively so few buyers, there wouldn't be anything to buy because it wouldn't be worth it for the sellers 

As the market grows, this will change.

Not as bad as it used to be. First motor mounts where like $120 each 3 years ago...
The reality is that people need markups because things fail. If they have any decent warranty or stand behind their product, there's a keystone markup or higher. This is the same in every industry.

You have to think about how much time goes into designing a part, having it made, and testing it... Takes months of time, and if your only going to make $3000 profit from 30 hours of work... A lot of guys smart enough to this stuff are making more than $30 an hour... And usually, it's more like 100+ hours, it's really like $5-$10 an hour. The market is small and it's getting really crowded fast.

There's sort of this race to the bottom, and I think it's not good in some ways. Cheaping out on quality will bring prices down, but when you start building serious boards, failures could be lethal, especially on public roads in a city. If you want to ride around your own property or on trails, then the lower quality is more acceptable. But one wrong move and your head is hitting a parked car like a rag doll, or you could get ran over.

The markup seems crazy, but when you get into quality, you'll see the difference. Weak magnets at $1 per motor or strong, high heat magnets at $15 per motor. Cheap shitty epoxy for the magnets that results in broken magnets for $1 or proper magnet glue for $14 a motor. Cheap epoxy for windings that results in wires coming lose resulting and shorting and keeps heat trapped in like a blanket for $1 or engineered motor winding epoxy for this exact application for $14 a motor...

I can go on and on, and for the most part, end users have no idea what goes into the parts they buy. Some are selling cheap hub motors that they call premium hub motors that cost less than $100 to make and selling them for over $500 a set. And that kind of markup I feel is wrong. But for a lot of stuff in eskate, prices do reflect actual costs. The differences posted above are why those cheep china hubs sell for $40 per motor while a good hub motor will cost over $100 per motor to make, none the less before any markup. One will feel like a Ford and last like a Ford and the other will feel like a Rolls Royce but last like a Toyota.

If something like this can be slimmed down and made more appealing, and designed to be widely compatible to just bolt on to the most common setups, this kind of addition would make a huge difference.

I modestly agree with basically all above about the main issues : 

Huge progresses have been made in the last years on the E side, ie electric/electronic (I confess that I've been monitoring decreasing frequency of fried motor/esc, broken belt,... on forums). 

Price/mark up is still an issue but it improves, same for reliability/accessibility/safety..... but not much progress has been made on the ultimate bottleneck : contact patch, grip, traction, wheels, tires...

So, I would dare to say that the last bottleneck is the old skatetruck design itself : you can't expect much performance from a XIXth century techno meant to dance waltz on a wodden floor.

Brakes. I always want more braking.

I don't like that braking force is related to battery charge state, and braking hard in the right circumstances (usually in the time of most need) risks all the electronics blowing up and consequently, no brakes. I'll also mention hot hot motors here.

I don't like that if there's some electrical glitch, no brakes.

Some mechanical brakes on the front wheels would really ease my mind. Would still worry about electrical failure taking out the remote receiver. Not sure if this can be dealt with nicely. Foot stompable emergency brakes maybe...

Oh I don't disagree with that. Im a bit suspicious about the quality of most of the branded motors out there that might just be re-labeled Chinese motors. Stick a new paint job on it and sell it for 50% more is not out of the realm of possibilities.

Some of this obviously stems from companies desire to get you to buy there finished product, so they mark up individual components. But come on, $100 for two PLASTIC drive gears and two $6 ea belts. That's just obnoxious. I think some of the complete boards are pretty fairly priced for what you get. Having said that, evolve/boosted and everyone else should not be using plastic drive gears on a $1500-2000 board. Especially when a drive gear failure could cause a lockup at speed. 

As far as motor mounts go, I think they remain significantly under-engineered for what they are. The block on the trucks by far needs the most work. From a cost perspective though, that's a single 2D machining process for a CNC --  most parts don't have threads either. Sure there is R&D time, I understand that. But theyre producing these at high volume and using them with a commercial product. Its $3 of aluminum + large batch machining cost and then selling for $30+ ea. Maybe $45 for two brackets? okay. $30 for bracket and trucks block, okay. But $30 for a single bracket, an additional $30 for the block. That's just getting silly. 

Evolve sells the TWO GT motor covers for $12. I can guarantee you they took 3 times longer in CAD to design. But they only fit evolve equipment, so the markup is reduce because the product is only applicable if you paid big money for one of their setups (which looks very nice). That's not unreasonable, but its a major disadvantage to the DIY community and should be a huge motivator to these start-ups. 

Electronics are a tough thing to stay competitive in. As the market grows and competition grows, electronic devices have razor thin profit margins because overseas manufacturers can get very competitive in that space. I think its smart for companies to reduce these markups to get more people on their equipment. As the DIY community grows, competition for individual components gets even tougher. Boardnamics is making motor mounts for $16 now per side. That's a big big difference from what the high end mounts that are going for $50-90 per side --  especially if things like 7075 aluminum doesn't make a difference to 90% of the riders who aren't doing extreme performance setups. 

This theoretical conversation could go round and round. To be honest, the DIY community will never exceed the standard customer volume for companies like boosted and evolve. DIY folks are not as big of a threat to their market share as we might think. 

Im not sure im a big fan of the direction electronics is going as far as VESCs are concerned. Combining components is nice from a design perspective. But in reality, the new VESCs that have integrated anti-sparks and other components are just asking for individual component failures requiring replacement of the entire device - which are far from cheap. Boosted and evolve are moving to manufacturing everything in house. And while combining components makes assembly and manufacturing processes easier, its a nightmare when something breaks. To make matters worse, warranties are relatively short. I mean 6 months for a $1500 board can be a lot of riding or not a lot depending on the rider and time of year

Lastly, safety is taking a long time to catch up. The big manufacturers should be leading this with standard or easily upgradeable light kits. They know that the majority of their riders are commuting on public roads and sidewalks with their products. They can wait for regulation to severely screw them, or they can get ahead of the curve. Im surprised that the new VESC design has not integrated automatic brake lights and front running lights.

I would say the biggest bottleneck of all is the lack of manufacturing available basically everywhere but China. It would be nice to have access to factories that don't have crazy if at all any minimums and decent turn arounds (not including transit time). Most Places like here in the U.S require you to have a business license to buy from the factory as well. It's all very disappointing to me, but on the bright side atleast there's still China.

That's much bigger than esk8 but a good point.

Almost 100% of our current electrical technology is limited by its energy consumption. For most portable electronics, battery capacity is the #1 limitation to almost all technology R&D. Since the development of LiIon, most of the technological advances in consumer electronics have been focused on power efficiency. We still see improvements in performance, but that's simply because the efficiency is improved. 

There will always be limitations for electrical current, resistance etc.

Germany. Our boards are considered identical to unregistered cars, but because not a single law covers this type of transportation you simply can't predict what the officer in question will do nor what the outcome of an investigation will be. What I noted down is worst case scenario that happened to a few. Others had their board taken, gotten 500 Euro fines and yet again others were let go with a warning and/or got their board back after a while.

Main issue is no law and no insurance that will cover us. No insurance equals illegal e-skating. 

Now that there is a small start in legalizing  electric scooters, we start noticing resistance from several industries. One being public transport. They want us to pay extra if you take an EV onto their train/bus/etc. The government is also afraid that they will miss out on tax (many people would no longer require a car), so they are figuring out ways to monetize it all. Would not be surprised if my e-bike needs to be registered in the future with a need for plates.

If the efficiency is 90%, it can only go to 100%, simple maths. I guess that 5% of the loss is in the copper, 4% in the iron and 1% in the ESC. So fixing these things with magic can only give you ~10% performance  increase.

What are we actually talking about?  Bottlenecks where?   You build a set up to handle your battery.  It is all the battery.   
You want to build a fire breathing dragon capable of supplying 200 amps then get an arc 200.  You want to build an 80 amp set up use a unity or 2 focboxes.  Bottlenecks only exist in pre built boards or badly designed diy's.  As things progress in battery tech so will the rest.

And as for what pushed this pastime forward in leaps.  Well thats Benjamin.

True, but all these technological progresses have to pass through wheel contact patch and generate enough traction forces ... it seems to be still a bottleneck there.

I would say biggest improvement should be made in stability and turning radius 'sector'.

Also the fact that mountainboard / airless tires consume 2x times more energy is not very good.

So if soft tire with less consumtion or stiff tire with suspension would be made possible, less weight/cost batteries could be used for same distance/range

This is comical. So let's say power in watts is equal to volts times amps. Amps are limited by electrical resistance. 

Let's say our overall electrical system is 1 ohm and our voltage is 50 volts. Volts divided by one equal amps. So to find power in watts we can:

50v/1ohm=50a   50v*50a=2500watts

Okay, now you change ohms to zero and tell me the watts, what percentage is that?

Holy shit.  Really.  Do the boards we ride today perform to the best of OUR abilities?  Yes they do.
This is a nothing thread.  Until we attain superhuman powers then there are no bloody bottlenecks to the performance we require.  All the technology is already here.  You want good traction off road then look at rally cars.  You want good traction on road then look at F1.  The electronics are already here.  We are the bottle neck but continue cluttering up the the forum with your pointless bollocks if you want.

Money is the biggest bottleneck. There are no really big fish in the industry no one with real money to invest. So all the esk8 innovations and innovator's come from this website that means these people if they want to sell their new stuff need to invest their personal money and basicly start a new buisness. This process takes a long time imo bottlenecking the progress in the esk8 world.

I don't agree, a lot of this comes down to rider skill. We are still riding skateboards here.

If you are happy with it, that's fine!

Coming from a boardriding background (ski,snow,surf), I expect much more G from my boards, much more carving and generally much more control.

Drifting hopelessly is a bottleneck to me...but again, if you are happy with it, that's ok for me.

We just don't call a board the same thing.

Your just not riding it correctly if your not hitting the G's you want. The other board sports you listed aren't powered so your basically talking about carving. This comes down to skill and setup. What duro are you riding? Are you using high quality wheels like abec11  or better yet abec12 jk

For me the bottleneck is the roads. Too rough and bumpy to ride fast, even with 150 mm AT. The sidewalks and bicycle lanes do not have the same requirements as for the roads in terms of smoothness etc. it seems here in Sweden.
And of course, the weather is a bi*ch!

The first attempt of our mighty german government was the limitation to 20 km/h and a driving license for a gasoline scooter and the person must be at least 15 years old. And on top a general operating certificate.That point is complete bullshit. And no esk8 and hoverboards were included in this law draft. The next attempt, after some critic from our folks, was to lower the minimum age to 14 and 20 km/h and 12 years for 12 km/h(there is no electric scooter for that speed lol). And the driving license was been tossed. You won't believe me, that this law draft is about 50 sites long. I would be fine with 25 km/h. 
This law draft converts also 250.000 electric vehicles on the german streets to scrap metal, caused by the general operating certificate.

Do you know me?  Do you know my background?  Of course you don't but still presumed to write off my experience as a typical skater.  Wonderful.  Now go and electrify that creation of yours and then we will see if it indeed does what you think it does.  I for one would love to see that board with power because I too have been riding boards my whole life.  I was using a landsailer in 1980 which is probably before you were born.  I was on the british funboard windsurfing tour when I was 15 which was probably before you were born.  Sponsored by sailboard when I was 16.  Still surf and windsurf every chance I get and am a member of my local cable ski joint because I can wakeboard too. Don't do too much snow boarding anymore because I have dislocated both knees more times than I can remember.  Never presume my friend.  Love your work btw
Now as @Andy87 has so succinctly pointed out we have massively derailed this poor guys thread.  :sunglasses:

Actually, yes, I know your riding habits quite well since I have had this talk with hundreds of different clients (downhill skate or mtb, kite, wind, ice, motor...) during the last 20 years. Typical truck/thane/no questionjustrideharder (and same courtesy :) ). (please don't mention my age).

Eboards are still boards and the same bottlenecks (lack of traction, wobble, busted bearing, melted hub, torn tires,...) happened in the 2000's mtb era, specially on Kitemtb, and were somehow addressed.

I simply remind the "lost memories" ...and believe that it will be much much worse with Eboards now that the electric/electronic power is widely available.

Again, you probably don't know but the whole boardriding business collapsed in the 2010's, specially mountainboarding, powerkiting... and it has been pretty painful (for insiders)! 

For the rest, I prefer to try hard, fail, try again... and face ironic comments from outsiders who have been there, done that, ...behind their screen or in their youth.  

As it turns a bit too "personal" and away from topic, I will initiate a separated post about Eflex where you will have the opportunity to express all your disagreements, hopefully technically documented.

That goes both ways.  Taking an elitist, "papa knows best,"  "I know what you do and need better than you do"  "you're not an insider" approach is irritating.  Especially when your goofy little setup is the answer to all our woes.  Feels more like baseless self promotion.

I like @dareno 's sentiment and I also think there are no bottlenecks in electric skateboarding today. The feeling of riding on a urethane wheel is the only reason I ride, anything else just feels dead and boring. Weight... I have found a heavy board to be quite nice, I have a little death whip that weighs 35lbs and it feels amazing in a hard turn. 

Try not to forget why a quality skate wheel is made the way it is today. The freewheeling they give from just a few kicks is and always will be exhilarating.
