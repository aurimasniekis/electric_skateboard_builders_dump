Hi! I have a quick question...

I see that a similar question has been asked about the Olin VESC ([link](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/soldering-5-5mm-connectors-to-63mm-motor/29083)), but I want to clarify with this specific ESC. 

I have [this](products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv) motor and [this](https://www.mboards.co/collections/escs/products/single-belt-driven-motor-esc) ESC.

The issue is that the bullet connector for the ESC are different sizes to the motor. The motor came with different bullet connectors that I can solder onto the ESC, but I want to make this this is the correct solution before doing this. 

Is it okay to solder new bullet connectors on this ESC?

Thank you!

Personally I like to elastic band a pair of pliers to clamp the bullet. Then use long-nose to feed the cable in. Tin the cable and the connector prior. flux wouldnt go astray too
