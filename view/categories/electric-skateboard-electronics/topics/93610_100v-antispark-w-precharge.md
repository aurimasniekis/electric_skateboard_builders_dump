After 3 iterations and far too many dud pcbs, here's a new antispark i hope the community will appreciate.

This started with @b264 and his excellent explanation on why the vedder switch blows. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vedder-antispark-design-problem-or-implementation-problem/77967?u=deltazeta

In designing this, I had a couple goals:

1. overbuilt current and voltage ratings for eskate
2. as small as possible
3. momentary button

To satisfy goal 1:

* this design uses 175A midi fuse blocks I saw on the DieBieMS.
  * The midi fuse standard allows for much higher currents than the old blade fuses.
* The mosfets chosen are rated for 100V and 260A, doubled up for a theoretical 520A continuous.
  * You'll never be able to get that much current through this design but this removes the mosfets from being a bottleneck in either voltage or current.
* Traces are beefed up with solder to improved current capability across them.
* The 5v regulator is rated for 150V.
* To handle the issue of precharge, the design uses a 10ohm resistor and a small 10A continuous mosfet.
  * This combo is enough for precharging even at 100V.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diy-6s-to-12s-bms-with-can-diebiems/2639?u=deltazeta

For goal 2:
* the pcb is shrunk down to a 23mm by 40mm size, restricted by the size of the midi fuse
  * If you don't mind forgoing the fuse, the design can be even thinner. 
* The 2 power mosfets are mounted on opposite sides of the pcb to further minimize the size of the pcb.

With goal 3, I personally couldn't come up with a solution that didn't require a microcontroller, so I ended up with an attiny85 running the show. Honestly could've gone even smaller, but this works great. But as many people have found out, these momentary button designs incur a cost of power drain while off. Luckily @Blasto made a post with an excellent design to disable the 5v regulator while off to minimize power. The 5v regulator used sips 1uA while disabled, which results in less battery degradation than the battery would see just sitting on its own. I didn't have equipment sensitive enough to measure that little of current draw, but I imagine its effectively 0.

@Winfly gonna be testing this on the road, so we'll see if anything funny happens

What a wonderful piece of engineering, I need exactly this. Can you please confirm that it can use a momentary push button and is auto reset to off position when you plug the batteries ?

Edit : Is it press ON / hold OFF?

Yup, uses a momentary push button, no latch required. The switch remains off with or without a battery, until you hold the push button for a set amount of time. I personally selected a 1 second on, and a 1.5 second off, but technically it could be personalized.

@deltazeta when this switch releases the power to the esc/vesc does is it a soft power release or it is a hard on off like a loopkey?

## \#29 Posted by: deltazeta Posted at: 2019-05-13T00:41:49.491Z Reads: 159

The power release will be similar to a loopkey. The precharge circuit is just a 10ohm resistor, like the xt90s' 5ohm resistor. The release will be "hard" compared to mosfet-based methods that ramp the power up, but slightly less hard compared to a loopkey.

Whether or not it will be sufficient to solve your problem is anyone's guess though.

I have also attempted this, and also failed to succeed in a way to design this without an MCU.  I feel like a certain combination of flip-flops and comparators should be able to do this, but I never came up with a way, especially after you add 50ms (on) and 2700ms (off) debouncing.  (the latter in case debris hits the power switch)

Could use just one MOSFET for some savings?

The Wurth screw terminal for fuse are from DieBieMS BOM? They're awesome but $4 per piece, and I think they have to be press fit into pcb using special equipment? I wonder if there's a cheaper and easier for DIY screw terminal.

Very nice, thanks for posting!

Then make it a little less, the point is hold-to-turn-off so if debris hits the switch it's very, very unlikely to be misinterpreted as a powerdown instruction.

My bicycle lights feel like they are about 50ms/2500ms

You could always try 50ms/1500ms

I specced the terminal holes according to the spec sheet and it fit no problem. I haven't looked into other options, but I'm sure there are some likely at lower current ratings. A single MOSFET is probably sufficient, many ways to strip down the bom cost. You could even just ignore the fuse entirely and just solder wire across :stuck_out_tongue:

It's 1000ms/1500ms now, but only because I have the precharge time tied to the on timer. Can be easily modified for user preference. To be honest I'd be very surprised debris is going to hold the button down continuously for more than 1.5s.

For the momentary function, my Logic Design class taught me something very simple, given any logical function, it the the question is "can we do it?" The answer is always: "Yes but how?"

Found this simple little guy. The term "Soft latch switch" brings up a number of.possibilites. I however do not see a switch in the current design and have not yet modeled it or found time to mess with the original design. So I am unsure where and how to implement a switch, of any kind, in your design

The other problem is you will need two bits of memory, not just one bit like that circuit has.

* device on or off?
* precharging or discharging?

So at a minimum you'd need two of those wired up in a convoluted way.  Likely with a couple comparators and a couple voltage dividers to get the signals under 5 volts.

Yeah! I did see your design, it was really quite an ingenious way to leverage analog logic like that. I considered how to borrow your techniques for a momentary switch based design but never quite figured it out.

This is the 3rd iteration of the pcb, used to be a bit bigger :stuck_out_tongue:. Needed to make it small to fit the eboosted vanguard enclosure, everything felt a bit too cramped.

I was on that page for so long when I was initially brainstorming :dizzy_face:. But as @b264 mentioned, it's a bit weird trying to get a precharge circuit in there, but more of my lack of expertise than anything. I also give up due to the sheer number of components needed.

So what exactly is the drawback to having the microcontroller? It doesn't have to be icp, except on debug boards. Once everything is tried and tested, there's no reason not to omit the header. Sounds to be like attiny is the simplest solution. Maybe I misunderstood, I'm working under the assumption that you are trying to replace the microcontroller.

Gotcha, I spent lunch thinking this over and the controller actually adds a ton of flexibility. Integration with other microcontrollers, choice of pretty much every type of switch. Temp sensor etc. All of it just a firmware patch away.
The reason I'm so interested is I'd like to use a teensy controller to control various components via nfc. This makes it more interesting.

Thenet me ask this, any reason **not** to order a set of PCBs and components as per your design, right now?

haha, yeah possibly adding roll to start in the future (maybe @Gamer43 could help), and idle time out would be easy with the mcu. I'm mainly holding off on "production" to really make sure it works. With the vedder/fechter antispark known to last for anywhere from 1 min to several months before randomly dying, really want to be thorough. I've been overconfident with my design before :stuck_out_tongue:

Also, roll-to-start and auto turn off will require high side switching. This can be done using a photovoltaic optocoupler or the LTC700x series of MOSFET drivers. I use the LTC7004. The LTC7000 is a 150V version if you want higher voltage ratings. This solution will opt for dV/dt inrush current limiting instead of precharge, only two passive components as opposed to multiple active components and a dozen passive components. There are many datasheets and application notes from multiple big semiconductor manufacturers that recommend the dV/dt limiting method.

What really sucks though, is the STM32L0 has a maximum supply voltage of 3.6V, while the LTC700x VCC UVLO kicks in at ~3.5V D:<. Have to go with a crappy attiny85 or an expensive 5v low power MCU, or bite the bullet and add a 3.3V LDO (and another three components reeee).

The LTC700x is better to use than a photovoltaic optocoupler, more stock available and easier to design around.

so a mosfet driver allows an n-channel fet to switch high-side?

Yes, it has an integrated charge pump to support 100% duty cycle.

The downside is that the chip is $4 in single quantity.

but can't i just have the fet driver go full on or off and keep the precharge circuit? Seems more reliable imo

Precharge has to move to high side along with the primary MOSFETs. It requires two transistors, a zener diode, and a bunch of passive components.

If an RC circuit works good enough, screw precharge. Details of the method can be found in the LTC7004 datasheet, page 9, no I lied, page 11.

hmm, I'll see what I can do...

I'm not too familiar with using fets as resistors, but the better the Rdson is, the worse the soa region.

If you really want precharge, use an appropriately sized P-channel MOSFET. It can be driven by an MCU using a level shifting N-channel MOSFET. Add zener diode and appropriate pullup and current limiting resistors accordingly.

The RC circuit controls the dV/dt slew rate and limits the inrush current to a constant value. The power dissipated in the MOSFETs is limited accordingly and decreases as the capacitors charge. Now the design consideration is to ensure power dissipation does not exceed the maximum rating of the MOSFET, i.e. SOA.

Rise time is now fixed and can be calculated (or user determined) easily.

Yeah I've looked into that one before, but as you said, its a bit of a hodgepodge of components just for a precharge.

If the RC circuit is based on dV/dt, wouldn't a significant change in capacitance or inductance adversely effect the current? Isn't this what vedder/fechter did in the original design, albeit with only passive components?
```

## \#82 Posted by: Gamer43 Posted at: 2019-05-14T08:09:38.037Z Reads: 99

```
Yes, you're right. It means there is a certain capacitance that will make it fail, so we'd have to design for worst case, i.e. maximum capacitance the switch would encounter, smaller capacitances will not be a problem.

And no, the original Vedder switch did not do this, or at least, not properly.

I have already tested this on a switch of my own. A pair of IPB014N06N have survived several cycles charging up to 6mF capacitances.

According to fechter's original design, I'd say they were using this technique, and with properly selected components it would work.

hmm, sounds good, what values are you using?

also does the slew rate maintain a constant dV/dt? that fet is restricted to fairly low current initially at full voltage difference

Hmm, looks like it does actually, not sure why those explode and mine haven't yet :man_shrugging:

I used 20k and 1uf, really should be 200k and 100nf. The rise time is actually significantly longer on mine because the bootstrap capacitor is only 2.2uf, maybe that's why mine haven't exploded yet? I have two, one in a mountainboard and another in a scooter.

Yes the dV/dt is constant, this also means the inrush current is constant during the charging process.

## \#86 Posted by: deltazeta Posted at: 2019-05-14T08:25:56.878Z Reads: 105

```
ok, I guess as long as the rise time is significantly long enough, there's minimal risk to the mosfet. At 60V across the fet, looks like you're limited to .1A, so under that constant current should be 100% safe. You'll probably have a bit more headroom at 50ish volts anyways.

It would be cool to see a rise time graph if you can manage one, real world data is always better than simulations.

I'll think about these ideas for a v2 probably, if the current design works for what it is, no reason to scrap it.

I don't think you should use that. Especially if not in parallel. The fet has an Rds resistance of 72mohms. That's way too high. Imaging pushing only 30amps through it. 30^2*0.072=64.8W You are not gonna get away without a huge heatsink.

Ah but that's only for the precharge, which has a 10ohm resistor to limit current. The main fets have an on resistance of 1.5mohms, and with two in parallel you get .75 mohms of resistance.
