Anyone tried this? 
https://flipsky.net/collections/accessories/products/antispark-switch-smart-280a
* Max continuous 280A, burst current 800A
* Max voltage: 13S (60V)
Sounds to good to be true and it have a push to start to and only for 49 dollars?

The BoM for an AS is quite cheap, especially in bulk. No idea if they can keep the stated current promise since no schematic provided that gives us a clue of the components.
Probably not the direct FETs that @Kug3lis lis is sporting tho.

Well wasn't too long :D

No way this stuff holds 280A with that "heatsink" :D

" **Smart: skate your board to power on , Stay still for 3 minutes automatically power off LED button:**  press 1second to power on, press 2seconds to power off"

3minutes is like a joke some stop lights here in UK are longer than that..

P.S. Looks really similar to @Martinsp

Well these kinda shits really "wants" me to go create something new... I am working on nice light controller which integrates with vesc/bluetooth and now don't even know if its worth to release it :confused:

LMFAO...I knew Kug3lis would be on here.  If the topic said FLIPSKY tshirts or key chains you would be on the thread saying...oh the cotton they use is cheap, it's going to tear after the first wash :wink: . Or the key ring is made of a brittle plastic, I'd be surprised this last a week :wink:

You have a special hard on for them.  I'm not an electrical engineer or anything but you sure are pressing the shit out of them more so than anyone else on the forums. I will say at least you are consistent :wink:

I don't give two shits if he hounds them into hiding...I find it hilarious, for the simple fact that I know I will see his name on any Flipsky thread. 

That is comical. All I know is the one product I own has been solid. Can't say that for all the other items I have bought from vendors on here.

you know, sometimes itÂ´s good to show the companys that we not totally idiots and they shouldnÂ´t continue cheaping out imortant parts...
I think what @Kug3lis does is not a bad thing and just keeps Flipsky holding on not totally produce the last sh**
In the end itÂ´s always up to you which product you choose from which company.
DonÂ´t think Kug3lis does so.... 
I also got two Flipsky 6.6 and will hopefully be happy with them.

Do it! Pour it with some resin and should be good ;) Price like stuff from China plus 50% (not 200% or more) and it will be win win ;)

Looks like MartinSPs.

But finally they did so you could remove the button! hated that on their antispark pro.

Their old antispark wasnt that good, so i doubt this will be amazing.

I picked up one of these but tbh.. even if the switch can deal with 280A.. can the wires actually deal with 280A continuous without heat issue?

Probably going to save it for a future less amp hungry build.  
For my trampa I am gonna stick to running 2 100 amp switches in palleral to ensure no bottleneck 

To flipsky's credit though dual 6.6 has performed, minus the setup quirks and the voltage reading quirk its been great so far

This is the antispark switch you are getting, it won't hold 280A

I am sure they don't mean 280Amps continuous draw. That would be insane. It might be able to sustain burst draw of 280A for a short period of time(They should specify what that period might be)

They are using 6 NVMFS5C628NL mosfets. The same ones as in almost all their ESCs. So not exactly 280 amps but should be adequate for almost any electric skateboard build. Plus they have copper bars to help increase the PCBs copper mass, lowering temperatures a bit. 

Although I haven't looked, I don't think very many other anti spark switches have this much cooling. 

As for the 3 minutes not being enough. It detects any pulse from a phase wire between the motor and ESC, so I'm pretty sure in that 3 minutes at a stop light, you'll touch the brake, or throttle, or roll back a foot, even if it's just for a split second.

Have 3, when I first tried connect one to my battery with 40 V it worked, connected it to my full charged 12s (50,4V) and it stopped working, same for all 3 they seems broken now and I havnt even used them, just tried to connect them
And they state that they work up to 13S.. I gues they only tried them on 10S..

I have one installed in my mini board 12s2p. After the first charge, the antispark cannot be switch off forever. I might switching back to a loop key after this.

Ok well i know they have problem with their antispark on 12. All my three was broken after first try with 12s like yours.
But they said it was the combo 6.6 and antispark smart that didnt work out.. But i gues their was more problems with 12s and that antispark

Their 6.6 vesc is running fine on 12s. But not on the 4.20v mini version.  Thats why I chose their 4.12v... and it costs 50$ each ðŸ˜‚. 
I am going to try to replace the new fets on this antispark and add a resistor to gate to slow down the current rush through it and also a loop key between the Battery.

My words don't mean anything because I'm too lazy to look back at my math, but I should have a post on the forum about these from a while back...

Those mosfets are NOT rated for NEARLY that current.

To maximize their performance their PCB would need to quadruple in size to allow for ambient cooling. And even so I think the max current would be closer to 200A peak, not sustained.

And adding copper bars will not help with cooling substantially. It increases thermal mass, but does not increase heat dissipation significantly, which is the only thing that matters for sustained current. It will help with peak, but NOT with sustained, which is already an incredibly inflated value marketed by them.

I hope you know what you're doing, because increasing the "turn on" timing of the fets could also just as easily blow them.

Any more info on this? I went to turn off my FSESC 6.6s with integrated antisparks the other evening only to find they no longer turn off. I'd originally ordered them without the antisparks too. Sigh. Less than 3 months of use.

Yes, all my 4 single vesc 6.6 did get same problem after first charge. They told me it happend because the button was not connected when I connected them. Not sure if I believe that. Their vesc is great but their antispark not so..

I have to see to PCB first. Might just adding the Loop key between them.

Part NÂº for the Fet is NVMFS5C628NL.
