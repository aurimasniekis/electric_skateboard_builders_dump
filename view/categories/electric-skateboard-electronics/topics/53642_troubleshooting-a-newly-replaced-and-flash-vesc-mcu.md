Hello,

I've got a vesc I recently fixed by replacing the MCU and DRV chip and flashing the MCU with a bootloader and the 2.18V firmware not when I connect it to the PC it reacts aight and can read the device firmware but when trying to do the motor test and move it at all it doesn't move the motor but shows the red led getting brighter when pushing the arrow keys.

Also have to mention that nothing on the board gets warm or hot(Except the MCU a very little but I assume it's ok sins it's a high speed arm processor)

Nothing in the faults although sometimes it gives me this error when the motor is connected but not consistent: 



The following faults were registered since start:

Fault            : FAULT_CODE_DRV8302
Current          : 0.2
Current filtered : 0.3
Voltage          : 23.30
Duty             : 0.95
RPM              : 4.6
Tacho            : 4
Cycles running   : 0
TIM duty         : 3990
TIM val samp     : 1050
TIM current samp : 3150
TIM top          : 4200
Comm step        : 5
Temperature      : 21.98

Any idea what is going on?

Thanks for helping.

Did you use a reflow oven for replacing the chips? If so Iâ€™d recommend rechecking all pins have enough solder, that nothing else got dislocated or bumped, then applying a generous amount of flux and rebaking.

 Can you post the output of st-util info and when you flash the boot loader. Then read back the on chip firmware and compare checksums.

Well, 

I did not reflow it just used the hot air to desolder the chips


That's the programming settings:
