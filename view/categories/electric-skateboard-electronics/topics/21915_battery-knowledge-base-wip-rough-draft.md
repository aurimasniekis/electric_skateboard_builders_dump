Hello everyone,
I've been meaning to get this thread going for a while. This is a tutorial on everything about batteires. From chemistries and their dangers to how to assemble and get your settings right. 

#**Disclaimer**
#Batteries are dangerous. If not treated right, you may burn your board/self/home. So please be careful 
#This is still in progress and very very rough draft at the moment
Here is the general layout for this post:

---

#Chemistries
Li-Po Li-Ions and Lifepo4
These are the main three types of cells to look into.
Lipos are mainly used in RC due to their high power density. 

**When to use Lipos?**
The only time you should use LiPos is if:
You have a very low budget 
You don't have the tools/skills/time to build a liion pack. 

Another exception is wanting a pack with tons of power and you don't need great range

**When to use Liions?**
In any other scenario that isn't described above consider using Li-Ions, whether DIY or bought. 

**When to use Lifepo4?**
In my opinion, never. 
They are safer than both technologies above but they are wedged so tight between the performance of both Li-Ions and LiPos, that there really is no use for them in electric skateboards
---

#Lipos

**Dangers and precautions:**


**Where to buy:**
The main source of Lipos is hobbyking

**Performance**


---

#Li-Ions

**Dangers and precautions:**

**Where to buy**
There are several places to source Li-Ions but in my opinion the most reliable with decent prices are the following

Liionwholesale.com for the US
Nkon.eu for Europe

Gearbest offers really cheap batteries and members of endless-sphere seem to agree they are authentic but I have personally never bought from them as they ship from HK and it usually takes months

Hey! You should mention lifepo4 can be used for a powerful little battery, like boosted one! 70amps continuous is pretty useful if one doesn't want to use lipos and can't stack liions up to 3p or more

Not wanting to use Lipos, doesn't mean that it's right. Unless you're constrained in space, in which case I still think that a good Li-ion cell (not 25R) performs better than Lifepo4

Im a little bit on a fence on this.. but I will get back to this in about 2days.. Ive got my own ''esk8 building'' seminar in two days and I still got to put a few info piecies here and there.. after that (on Sunday / Monday) I could think about some sort of contribution to this..

I think for now @PXSS just continue as you started.. when I will see some progress and areas which might need further ''develeopment'' I will maybe step in and offer resources / quotes / graphs and other stuff I have found on the net, which might adress these additional issues / fields not covered in the text.

@SirDiff I think he meant can you easly buy / access 123A cells.. to make lifepo packs with 70A discharge..

I know they've been used a couple of times and Nkon Eu site actually does have some in stock but they cost crazy expensive for regular builds, I think.

Yeah, they do cost a lot, like double a normal 18650, but if you compare it to a basen for 8 euros, you just pay the extra for the discharge rate instead of capacity. Basens have nearly double the capacity, a123 have nearly double the discharge current. I wouldn't actually buy them, cause a compact liion 10s3p could work just as well as a 10/12s2p of a123, and take the same space, but if one wanted a better boosted board with like 140A continuous in a split enclosure configuration, that would be key

I compared **sony vtc6**, **sanyo GA** and **a123 26650** to see more clearly why a123 does not fit well in esk8 applications.
If we consider 80amps as the optimal max discharge rate of an esk8 battery pack, these are the following results:

* **a123** "wins" only for 1p packs; adding parallels will just increase dramatically cost and max amps.

* **sony vtc6** wins for 2p,3p....7p packs; after 8p, further gains in max amps are useless, range and price is worse than sanyo.
* **sanyo GA** wins in any configuration above 8p; price and range are the best, amps already reached the optimal value at 8p

@PXSS  To be honest, while you are still ''recruing'' the crew for writing, I think we should adress the problem with mountainboards and some unclarity for typical power consumtion.

This comes into play when designing the power output of the battery for the build.

For example, with longboard builds it is somewhat clear, that the ''expected'' consumtion is: ~10wh/km or even less.

With mountainboards it gets a bit more tricky, where a somewhat average figure is 20wh per km.

This does not really include dual drive setups, about which im not super clear about too, how much more do they actually consume and how much extra power / watthours per battery pack are needed to run a dual.

So yeh, if you got someone to recommend for these matters, that would be cool!

I know @Ackmaniac should have some extra longboard data, @Duffman also knows a thing or two about power consumtion.. but generally, there is info lacking in this field or it is scattered around the forum in short one post type replies under different topics.

So yeh, If I were to make a more detailed list of battery info, I would go extra deep on what the typical power consumtion might be.. This, unfortunately, includes speed / terrain data and this is where it might get a bit tricky..

@fedestanco some good info there!

I remember someone made a list of prices of nkon batteries and the best cell for the money in terms of capacity per $.

[quote="lowGuido, post:23, topic:21915"]

[/quote]

Definitely not. 
- A LiPo pack can be made with simple wire harnesses (one for mains and one for balancing) without any mods to the individual packs. Just soldering a harness. 
- You can go further and solder the packs together. The process is still fairly simple with descent soldering skills.  
-If you really want to go all out, you can unfold packs and make yourself a "slim lipo", but again, all that is required is soldering skills. 

For a Li-ion pack, you need more than just soldering. 
For starters, you need a battery tab welder, which is a very rare tool even for an electrical engineer or a hobbyist that does a lot of electrical junk. Welding batteries is also not trivial, as with soldering. If you have a high power pack you also need to solder copper wire on top of the nickel or do several layers of nickel tabs which cannot normally be done well with some welders. If you decide to solder batteries, you have to be very careful with heat and melting the heatshrink around the positive end as this could result in a short. Then, you still have to solder balancing leads and main leads which requires the same skills as soldering Lipos does. 

I'd like to see your counter argument as to why soldering Lipos would require more skills than building a good Li-ion pack. I've built both not only for electric skateboards but also for rc boats, rc aircraft and military grade UAVs and I would always say that the Lipo packs are simpler than Li-ion packs.

show me an 18650 that 5mm wide? plus the cylindrical package of 18650 means that you can fit more lipo battery with less air... so while what you say is true that lion is chemicaly energy denser than lipo. they are not as energy dense per space.

they have a higher volumetric energy density despite the packing ... and in praxis you get your factor of 2 without any real downsides. 

i sold a few sanyo ga 10S6P batteries for replacing the evolve carbon stock lipo battery, typically more than doubling stock range (in praxis, not theory!!) and everybody reported a subjectively stronger board with better acceleration and top speed. my guess is that compared to the stock battery, the large liion battery apparantly also didnt have as much sag!

even your 5mm argument isnt entirely true, because you cannot run lipo under enclosure pressure like the physically way more robust cylindrical lion cells because the lipo pouches can swell and build up pressure (up to 8mm thickness).

the only reason for me to pick a lipo pouch is for cheap high power densities (!= energy densities). most of these power densities are beyond what our setups can properly handle though ... and in praxis id probably go for the much more robust A123 chemistry in that case.

First I shall tackle the A123 and Samsung 25R cells

Here are some basic specs for the cells, you will notice that my continuous current values are higher than the datasheet values. This is tested maximum current for at least 5 minutes and not their entire charge. Also the volume has been calculated as if they were squares and not cylinders.

**Energy Analysis**
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/6/e64ef8e5bf5693b4357a3b9a1c6cb631bfe40f24.jpg" width="476" height="121">
The most energy dense are of course the Sanyo GA cells with a whooping 578 Wh/L and 268Wh/kg. Not too far behind are the 30Q and Sony VTC6 cells. 25Rs have 71% energy density and 76% specific energy which is not great but also isn't terrible. The one cell which is absolutely horrible in my opinion is the Lifepo4 cell with only 32% energy density and 40% specific energy of the Sanyo GA cell.
 

**Power Analysis**
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/2/e21e11d8c8a13cbdeebde2cb44df19bdcd04c84a.jpg" width="690" height="64">
Here is where the A123 shine. They can produce lots of power. Up to 200W per cell! The issue is they also produce a lot of heat at this high power output. If you limit them to 30A per cell they only produce 13% heat which is better than both 30Q and VTC6 and on par with the GA cell at twice the power output which is pretty incredible. The issue with doing this would be reducing the specific power and power density to the same levels as the GA cells.

Another good thing to point out is how mediocre the 25Rs are. They produce a lot of heat, 21% of the max power generated is heat. They packs good punch for their weight but get left behind by the VTC6 and 30Q cells when it comes to power density.

The GA cells only produce 13% heat but they also only output 50% the power of the 30Q and VTC6 cells both of these cells are more efficient at 15A producing only 8.1% heat. The 25Rs produce 14.8% heat at 15A in comparison.

The cells that shine the most here are 30Q and VTC6 in my opinion by producing almost 95W per cell and keeping the heat produced relatively low. They pack the most power for their weight and size when you take into account that the A123 need a heatsink in order to take full advantage of their 70A rating. Plus both of these cells can do higher bursts of power as long as the temperature stays below 80C.


**Cost Analysis**
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/c/8cf518424b176a15431b218657aced2e0c98c537.jpg" width="476" height="120">
This is where the A123 fall apart and the 25Rs start looking like not such a terrible cell.
The A123 only bring 0.89Wh/$ to the table while the top three are well above 3Wh/$.
They also dont bring the best to power per dollar to the table, in fact they come in third just barely edging out VTC6s 20.78W/$ to 20.40W/$. The top two produce above 30W/$.

The 25R cell is the most economical one with 3.59Wh/$ and 34.1W/$. The downside being that you'll have to have a larger and more inefficient pack whether you want power or endurance.

In my opinion, the 30Q is the best cell overall when taking into account cost. They are slightly inferior in every way to VTC6 but they also only cost 66% which is not worth it to me. The GA cells are the best for endurance packs but the 30Q cells cost 78% of them.

@SirDiff
@Okami

Once I add Lipos to the top end, you will see how these are wedged out of the race, since Lipos cost even less than Li-ions and have a higher power density than lifepo4s

to be fair I never said that lipos are best or better.. its well known that LiIon is a superior chemistry, but it was insinuated that they are only the poor mans choice.

this is not the case. I choose lipos because I can fit 12S into a 15mm deck thickness and that would be impossible with 18650s

Thanks for the comparison of the different Li-Ion batterys. I would like to see how they compare to these LiPo batterys:

Until now I mostly used these Lipos (in 3s 2p) because they offer a good tradeoff in terms of price, capacity, discharge rate and convenience: 
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-4s1p-14-8v-20c-hardcase-pack.html

These would be the choice for absolute high power racing use. Two packs (2x1kg) in series for 12s could deliver 17kW constant!:

@PXSS which source did you use for battery price points?

Maybe one day someone makes a tool that compares battery prices from different sources and outputs them in one place :D with customizable options to choose / complect the battery pack you desire.

Nice work non the less :)

Could you shed some light where did you get the heat data? Did you obtain it yourself?

@Okami 
I used Nkon with a quantity of 40 cells for the price. 

The heat data was calculated by taking the voltage drop across the cell from no load to the loaded condition and multiplying it by the current.
Heat = Vdrop x I = IR x I^2

@Duffman
I will look into these. I will most likely end up buying a few to do my own testing as I can't find discharge curves for them.

@PXSS  Ok, so as I understand, you just took maximum current rating of the cell + voltage drop witnessed at 1.5ah capacity (no load/load) and then just extracted the watts for heat from the formula, correct?

The ''truth'' that Sanyo GA produces the least heat for its power level was an interesting find.

Though, it is also the least ''power dense'' cell but still manages to show that at its max rating it does not overheat excessively, correct?

In contrast, 25R at 20A cont, produces a whopping 24W of 'lost energy' as heat.. That is quite a heater, if you ask me :D 

And I also remember vaping forum's tests, where it showed cells beings at 80+ degrees C (~176F) when outputing constant 20A current.  So yeh, I might say numbers are convincing..

---

Now.. when ''investigating'' this further, it would be interesting to hear why you chose **''1.5Ah''** as reference point? Was it because it somewhat resembled nominal voltage for these ~3ah cells or it was something else?

I must assume this also plays a bit against Samsung 25R, for the reason that most of its capacity is spent beyong 1.5ah point, as less than 1ah of 'usable capacity' is still left in the cell..

If you read the text, I mention what the heat produced is for cells at 15A which is what the GA cells max output was. The A123 generate the least heat, only producing 6.97% heat. The VTC6 and 30Q produced 8.85% and 8.89% respectively. The GA cells produced 12.73% heat and at last place the 25R produced 13.13% heat.

I realized that I had made a type when inputting the 25R data and it seemed worse than what it is but it still comes in last. I want to take more time to do the analysis properly and double check all the values before adding it to the main post as well as adding Lipos to the mix.

Okay, now I see it.. So it still points out that basically, at 15A, the Sanyo GA still outperforms Samsung cells right?

This is also fascinating, in a way that Sanyo Ga is usually 'labeled' as 10A cell, where 25R is 20A cell.

So yeh, in contrast, 25R is a good cell to use (because of cost) with its shortcomings in terms of heat / capacity. Then comes the 30Q which is quite a lot better but a bit more expensive.

This is why I hate when people quote the limits without truly understanding them. Most of the time the limits are based on using the cells for their entire charge at said current and meeting a life cycle threshold that varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.

So yeh, in contrast, 25R is a good cell to use (because of cost) with its shortcomings in terms of heat / capacity. Then comes the 30Q which is quite a lot better but a bit more expensive.

[quote="PXSS, post:38, topic:21915"]
This is why I hate when people quote the limits without truly understanding them. Most of the time the limits are based on using the cells for their entire charge at said current and meeting a life cycle threshold that varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.
[/quote]

This is a good point you are referring to. The same thing happens with VTC4 and maybe VTC5 cells too. They were initially ''labeled'' as 30A cells, when tests showed,  they are more like 22-24A cells (for safe usage and no overheating)

Mh, so this probably brings us back to the ''heat problem'' that some cells just heat up more than others, which then again shows the 'true picture' of their real performance I think, and how much (and whenever at all) they can be pushed past their limit a bit more for momentary gains of power etc..

Maybe this can be pointed out later on about Li-ion 18650 cells.. that their ''safe usage'' is in between 2-3C of their capacity, with 5C usually ''topping them out a bit''.

Of course, for vtc6, this ''C rate'' is a bit higher than for Sanyo GA, but still.

--

This was somewhat the early ''confusion maker'' for me, when deciding which cells to use, as the lipos used C rate and I had to do the calculation all the time myself (plus, no reliable way of telling whenever max rating labeled on the lipo pack is true or not).. 

So when different C rates mix up together with different Ah pack's it gets confusing..

So while li-ions use amps for their rating usually, the c rate still remains a good way for telling the max or recommended power level of the cell I think.. also works good for when deciding at what charge rate to charge your cells (0.3c , 0.5c, 1c)

I hate the C rating. Think about it, a 20C 5000mAh cell can output twice as much as a 20C 2500mAh cell. Whereas 30A is 30A regardless of capacity.

@PXSS hah yes, we are on the same line here :D

Though, for low 2-3 and 5c calculations it is not as bad, as long as capacity is not over 4ah or something :D 

At least for Li-ions I find it much easier to calculate capacity, of course it is still messy, because the capacity's number change but at least they dont go over 100-200A mark.

Maybe they should make some sort of ''standard'' to include both numbers automatically, Amps and C rate, though I think the c rate is partly because of rc stuff's guys, who use it a lot to determine the battery's output, since they tend to use very narrow bands of capacity's.. For example ~2-3ah for 3s battery. Then, since they are working with 3s all the time anyways, they can multiply the C rate easly with the right data straight ahead..

Or some, just like to refer 20-25c rate as good for their size battery.. and lower as bad :D

I don't understand how you calculate the Vdrop at peak current (from datasheet?) but think that this website will help as it has loads of discharge curves and battery reviews (http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Common18650comparator.php). I would also like to know your opinion on these two batteries (https://eu.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/panasonic-ncr18650pf-3-7v-2900mah.html) and (https://eu.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/samsung-inr18650-29e.html) as I am planning on a 7s 6p setup for commuting and found these are cheaper than the samsung 25Rs have a larger capacity and still a decent discharge (hoping that I won't need to pull more than 40A on a 7S on flat tarmac roads.

@Print3r  To be honest, u might as well try in this topic:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/choosing-18650-cells/6240

I think more users are hooked up there, plus maybe this topic for now could be kept for general questions related to all batteries and the finalization of what kind of info needs to be gathered / told about etc.

--

I cannot really compare these, maybe take Sanyo GA or 30Q and then take a look how they compare.

If you are not straining them to the max, it might be okay, especially considering that you wont pull 40A on flats probably.. unless going like +40kph I imagine.

@PXSS, You should really stop creating this on here, it's a horrible medium for making a factual in-depth review of batteries, and it's going to be messy (and already is).
Make a website, and simply link it, that way you can make it properly. For example, when saying something, link it to things that prove it (more things the better), and try to offer alternative thoughts as well to show you're not just thinking of one scenario, @lowGuido has already given you a shining example of how LiPo's can be arranged to make an ultra-slim and cost-effective board.

Also some constructive criticism: -

If it's a battery knowledge base, why are you starting with your conclusions? You should present information and let people make up their own minds, and based on what you wrote you're definitely biased. Why can't you think of a single reason to use LifePo4? And why are you insinuating that only poor or un-skilled people use LiPo's? You should phrase it more tactfully, like listing the pro's of Lipo's as "being cheap" and "already come with connectors"

I personally think that without having all three types of battery to test on a board, you can't really present anything substantially useful, it's all good shouting out numbers, but you ideally need hard evidence to back up any performance claims.

Your spreadsheets in post 28 look good, but you should substitute it for bar charts, it'll display that info far more elegantly (even better, present both the spreadsheet and bar chart). Also, why aren't you adding in the hidden costs of making packs? Where's the cost for the spot welder factored in?

*Sorry if i'm attacking your post, really didn't want this to read like it, but I think I failed that

@PXSS I have to agree with @riva_00. The organization could use some work. I could be beneficial to make a pros/cons list in a google sheet and share it here. Then when people have new ideas they can comment/add to the sheet and we can arrive at the _best_ Battery Knowledge base that is easy to come by, rather than having to read through an entire thread.

@PXSS I hope you dont mind what other folks are saying here.. just keep on doing the work, man ;)


As to @riva_00 I understand your concern about some of the ''flames'' PXSS made.. though I think he will explain his beliefs.. and once he makes the info more structured, it will be way more easy to look through it..

He just said he spent a night during calculations or such, so I must say his output (visual style) might not be the best one yet because of the time constrain..

He just put the stuff he made, so we can see and share our thoughts onto..

--

If not him,, it was already outpointed to, that Lifepo pack out of A123 cells are very good for ''power dense'' system, utilising only 1P config of batteries but for them to perform to their ''best potential'' they need to be properly cooled, otherwise they just get too hot to continue their current delivery..

If im not mistaken, this might be some of the early concerns the A123 had.. or what might have caused them to cease their operation a bit..

I agree with both of you, @riva_00 and @Challlsss. 
My post reads horribly right now. It was something I whipped up at midnight and really only posted by accident before I had any time to put any real meat and substance to it.   

I do not want to create a website as I feel that defeats the purpose of reaching members of this forum and will eventually be forgotten. Here, it will get more visibility and help guide people. 

The OP will at some point have all the information to help people make the right choice on batteries. That is not the case right now. It also reads very biased as is right now because as I said, it wasn't meant to be published just yet and most of the little snippets were just self reminders to fill certain sections and some points I want to touch upon.

I have lots of experience with both Li-ions and Lipos in skateboards and other applications. I have a lot of test data to back up my claims that i will hopefully be able to upload to a google drive at some point. The main reason I don't want to do this right now is that I need to make sure that everything I post on here doesn't overlap with my job. I am an aerospace engineer that does performance analysis and design on electric powered aircraft and my work is proprietary and some of it government property, so I need to walk a very fine line on not using any data that I have acquired through work. This makes it hard for me not to seem biased as there is a lot I cannot share...

As far as scenarios I have not taken into account, like the one brought forward by @lowGuido. That is trully the purpose of this thread. I fully appreciate that input! The more people find holes in the OP, the more I will be able to add to it and have a better guide for all!

I appreciate your input and it'll take some time to get this thread to the point of being a true database and guide but we have to start somewhere...

I tested the voltage of all my new batteries.
They range from 3.407 to 3.61
Does the state of charge out of the box mean anything? Should I mix up the high and low ones to make parallel groups or put the ones with similar voltage together and let the BMS fix it?
I have 4 extra should I just discard the ones with the lowest voltage?
```

The voltage can and will vary. Usually batteries within the same batch and shipping come with the same voltage. In my experience close to 3.5v per cell, sometimes there are some cells with lower voltage and some with higher. I wouldn't worry too much about it. You can't really tell the health by voltage.

The best way to check health is by checking the internal resistance of the cells. This can be done manually by fully charging the cells and then waiting at least 5 minutes for the voltage to stabilize for no load. You can then load the cells at 1A and measure the voltage. Unload them and wait another 2-3 minutes, measure voltage and then load them at 3A and measure voltage drop. Repeat for 5A. Then with this you can calculate the internal resistance by using this equation:
Rint = (V0 - V1) / I
R = internal resistance
V0 = No load voltage
V1 = Voltage under load
I = Current
Then you can take the average of the three values.
Some RC chargers also do this process automatically, for example my iCharger 308 Duo, has 2 channels which can measure up to 8 cells in series. so I can measure the internal resistance of 16 cells in less than a minute.

The lower the internal resistance of the cells the better. So you can choose the 4 cells with the highest internal resistance and not use them, or if they're all fairly close then you can just use them all

[quote="lowGuido, post:29, topic:21915"]
to be fair I never said that lipos are best or better.. its well known that LiIon is a superior chemistry, but it was insinuated that they are only the poor mans choice.
[/quote]

My feelings exactly. I use lipos because li-ion sag too much for me in a 12s4p config. I am going to be trying a 12s5p config soon which should hopefully be a bit better, but for my own personal boards, lipos perform way better. You stay at a higher voltage for longer, so late in my ride, I only lose 1-2 mph in top speed. With li-ion, I lose 5-6 mph later in my ride. Also, because of less sag, I get more range from an 8Ah lipo than a 10Ah li-ion. A lot of the energy near the end of the li-ion can't be used without sagging it to levels that could damage the cells.

I wouldn't say lipos are only a poor mans choice. They are good if:

- You need to save money
- You need to minimize sag (which is for anyone with steep hills)
- You want to maintain performance through out the entire ride
- You want to fit the battery into a small space that li-ion simple can't fit.

Saying they are a poor mans choice only is simply not true.

@evoheyax What Li-ions have you tried?
I'm sure your issue was either having the wrong liion (25R) or wrong settings.

IMO, Lipos are good for the first and last of your points.
Steep hills can b e conquered with the right Li-ion cells as I've stated before. 
Now if you want a board with serious power, I mean lots of power, then yes. Lipos are the way to go.
Maintaining performance through the entire ride is a matter of wrong settings IMO

Ask @mmaner, he's got a 25R 10S4P pack, a Lipo pack and a 30Q 10S4P pack. I think he's also tried a Lifepo4 pack before. His 30Q pack is anything but lacking in power

I have and I have.  I love the 30q pack, it has as much torque as my 10s lipo packs.  It's obviously more expensive but you get more charges/discharges so it comes out pretty close to even.  I only use my 10s 25r pack on my beater board, it says in hills pretty bad.  

I still feel that lipos have a place in powered boards, they are cheap and powerful, they are easy to purchase and easy to build series packs with.  

Given a large budget, I'd probably go with 30q's but when you constantly build boards that's not really an option 😀.
