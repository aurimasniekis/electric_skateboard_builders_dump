Am i missing something here?.... is it possible to create an anti spark out of an XT90s and a normal switch. Instead of a loop key? I've never seen it done but cant figure out why as it seems like it would be a cheap alternative to the loop key for those that want a switch.

So could a switch not be wired in where the loop wire goes and it would still work as an anti spark? Excuse me if this a complete noob question ha

This topic has been covered before and the answer is still no, it won't work because the function that prevents spark happens when the connector is plugged in
