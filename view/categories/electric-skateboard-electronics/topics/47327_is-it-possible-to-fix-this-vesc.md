The DRV8302 got burnt and I tried to remove it with my soldering iron, but as you can see in the picture below, things got real nasty. Should I lose hope?

OOOOOooooohhh boy.  lol maybe @JohnnyMeduse could fix it if you send it to him but it looks like some of the pads might have burnt off.

The DRV chip has a ground pad underneath it, so you pretty much require a hot air/ reflow station to get it off cleanly

I'm sorry to say it looks like you've destroyed a lot of pads on the PCB :disappointed: That may well be unrepairable :/
