Against the advice of nearly everyone on this site I did a boneheaded move and bought a Flipsky 6.6 FSESC (not to be confused with the Flipsky 6.6 FSESC Plus) anyways.

I have to live with the repercussions of bad buy so please don't beat this dead horse. In short, my goal was to build a 4WD board and the Flipsky website for the 6.6 FSESC mentions nothing about being unable to support 4WD (but go the the 6.6 'plus' page and it mentions 4WD support), needless to say I spend $550 on FSESC that are useless to me now for my project but here I am trying to salvage something form it which leads me to my question:
 
I have used the VESC tool (even bought the bronze edition) to program and setup the ESC to connect and ride (setup went smoothly) but when I connect and try to ride the board it won't go. It just struggles to do anything but when there is no weight on it, it bolts like a cheetah- WTF?

I am either the dumbest person ever or the Flipsy FSESC is shit

did you get two dual 6.6's or 4 single 6.6's? they all support 4wd if you know what your talking about lol

with 2 x dual 6.6's you use split ppm

with 4x 6.6's you do canbus turning 4 esc basically into 2 dual esc's than you use split ppm

i think this quote might be accurate

anyways you prob have your board on sensorless mode which requires a kick off

These is nothing wrong with FSESC6.6 except minor voltage sensing issue.

No, I have not tried a kick-off. Didn't think it was necessary.

I thought that was the purpose of these types of VESC's - to allow sensorless (which is the type of motor I am using) motors a smooth start-up?

yes sensorless requires kick off sensored does not

smooth meaning the acceleration is not jerky

And minus the fact that the 6.6 does not support 4WD and the website focusing on the product fails to mention this - that's a pretty big fuck-up. I'm out $550 because of it.

The Flipsky 6.6 FSESC definitely supports 4 wheel drive.

There are many ways to do this.  I recommend having a separate remote receiver for each ESC/motor but there are other ways like Split "PPM" (PWM) and CANBUS.

Nice. Good on you dude. In the real world sometimes people are new to a forum or forums in general. They don't even know what a search bar or searching is. Or maybe emotions of a first purchase happens. Or maybe they search under the wrong search terms and can't find what they're looking for. Or something else. These threads only become useful if we help. 

No hard feelings at all on my end dude. I like you. I think I've just had it with the rude shit going on around the forums lately. Just remember when you were brand new. It might help the empathy levels a bit. ;)

Love my FVESCs. What's up with the attitude? Look, you don't just blame others or their products, when you just had difficulty figuring it out for yourself. So in answer to your question, it ain't the FLIPSKYs.

The information about how it could work was too short. As someone exposed to VESC's for the first time, split ppm, Canbus and all this terms are not understandable. And on top of that he got wrong information from the vendor. As a noob being deeply disappointed can lead to a rush of emotion. A link to a thread and a more detailed explanation would have helped.

To be fair... if you don‚Äôt know what is split ppm than better don‚Äôt start up building a 4wd...
I‚Äòm all into explaining new people here the basics, but I also think there is a good amount of information here in the forum to find things out by your own. People should understand how things work when they build there boards to don‚Äôt fuck up the electronics or even worth crash so somewhere. A 4wd is a powerful board and you should know what you doing when you build one.
I hope the OP as min know what fail save is... if no, than it‚Äôs time to let him know before things get south!

But all this can just take place if also the OP is ready to take on advice and don¬¥t get ignorant to suggestions.

You can also pair a gt2b remote with two receiver. In this case no can connection or split ppm between  the front and back, but your 4wd will work just fine.

I got nothing to add here, except to tell OP that basically all vesc can run 4wd with the right setup. Or prob 12 wheel drive too. üòã

What a sandbox thread, Yes, you can make a 4wd.

Regarding the motor not turning, try searching on the sbuject. Its one of the most common questions. Alot of settings to fiddle with.

[/quote]

Im not sure anyone learned a thing here. Lol

Well, other than karam knows venom doesn't hate him.

OP hasn't replied in a bit. 

Basically dude @kchxaz if a vesc can do one wheel drive. It can do 4wd. You just gotta know how to hook it up. 
If you don't believe us...... cool. Don't care,  it's nobody's job to hold your hand.  Figure it out yourself.  
OR, you can try to hear what people are telling you. 
People here wanna help, even if they are asshats about it.
Good luck with the build.

These is nothing wrong with FSESC6.6 except minor voltage sensing issue.
[/quote]

This. 

I've put 4600 miles on my pair of FSESC 6.6. They're solid. It's the cheaper ones that have had some issues in the past.

Edit: hopefully you didn't get the ones with integrated antisparks. Because there's no good integrated antispark. I ordered them without and got a 'free upgrade' to the integrated antispark version. Womp womp
