Hey guys, I bought a cheap esk8 here https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/AU-250W-18km-h-Electric-Skateboard-Wireless-Longboard-Deck-with-Remote-Control/362607369454?_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20160908105057%26meid%3D6e11ff513fdc4b7581fc0de40e6df7d0%26pid%3D100675%26rk%3D5%26rkt%3D15%26sd%3D142936868503%26itm%3D362607369454&_trksid=p2481888.c100675.m4236&_trkparms=pageci%3Abc0cb17c-6ca6-11e9-b14a-74dbd180f4de%7Cparentrq%3A7750170b16a0ab1cb633a4d5fffa258d%7Ciid%3A1
Was planning to scrap it for parts once it predictably died.
So it showed up today and lasted about twenty minutes, was working awesome then just cut out on me, started up again then died properly.
I only get a quick beep and flash of the light when I hit the power button, a couple times when I pressed it rapidly the power button glitched out and connected/disconnected rapidly till I pressed it again.
It works fine when plugged in. I'm guessing the battery or power switch are busted. 
Anybody feel like guessing which? Should I put it out in the shed or something till I know what's up? And how dangerous will it be to pop open? It sparks at the charge port when I plug it in. Not super confident they've insulated everything in there properly.
and I know. "don't buy eBay crap" I was fully expecting this board to fail, I just want the battery case, motor, trucks, remote and charger from it, planning to move those onto a trick deck and upgrade the battery/esc/BMS.
I'm just a little bummed it died so quick, I got literally twenty minutes of riding on my first ever motorised board. It was glorious, and now I can't do it anymore :'( 
If I can patch it up with a loop key till the other parts arrive I'll be happy. Gonna buy a new battery next week, even if it works the capacity on this one is tiny.
But seriously should I wear rubber gloves to take the case off or something? I don't wanna get shocked, definitely gonna do it outside, with a fire extinguisher.

You bought an obviously cheap china hub motor board, expecting it to fail, and now want other people to donate their time helping you fix it?

You can easily take this case off.  I think it has a 7S1P battery in there.  There isn't much you can use here.  Not the remote, ESC, or cells.  The motor is very low quality, and you only have one truck, so you'll need another one of those at a minimum... and the charger is 7S which won't work on other voltages...

You essentially have a deck.

Mate I'm not asking for charity just a simple "yeah it's probably the flimsy little power switch, build a loop key" 
Or "nah the battery is clearly damaged" 
I'm not standing on a street corner asking for bus money. This site is specifically for people to ask about eboards, that's what I'm doing.
You're not gonna build much of a community by being a pretentious wanker to every noob who asks a question.
I'm not trying to make this my forever board, I just want a dodgy piece of crap to cruise around on while I wait on parts. 
I'm happy to stick with whatever voltage this battery is I just want a longer range, it's like 2200mah, my phone has more juice than that.

the insulation isn't bad, nor is there a need to buy a fire extinguisher.

it sparks because you need to plug it into the wall first then into the board.

it's a common thing, and i'd wager that board is built about as well as most current boards on the market, just with cheap parts. 

also, i'd say return that broken board and just buy a good deck with that money instead.. the parts aren't really worth the cost if you won't be using the remote/battery/esc/ itself.

it's about the same as paying for 300$ for a cheap laptop but only keeping it because you want to reuse the shell and not the hardware which made the cost high in the first place.


start from scratch and pick something that will actually last you longer then a month.

Thank you :) that was much more constructive, honestly though I am just looking to make this barely work for the time being, I have a parts list for a dual chain driven system I'm slowly buying up, this project is just to keep me occupied while I do that as It'll take me a few months to save up for a proper vesc, motor, and everything else, already spent $300 on a Longboard to mount it all on.
The end result I'm hoping to get from this is a trick deck that goes about jogging pace I can put my friends on while I ride the Longboard, and a bunch of experience fixing/replacing dodgy parts.
It's like giving a 17 year old kid a toolbox and a car that'll barely make it down the road, he'll either learn to fix that car or get used to walking.

Where are you based?  I'm reading in australian now.  Open it up and take a look.  Deconstruct the thing and see what you actually bought.  Realistically if you get to use the motor deck and enclosure then you've probably broke even but don't let that deter you.  This is how most of us got into this hobby in the first place. (Shut up Brian).
Take a crap pre-built and make it better.  Great learning curve.  I'm guessing theres a chinese sinewave esc in there and a cheap 7s low quality cells battery.  It will move you along but thats about it.  Again no drama.  We can rebuild it.  Get it opened up and post the pics.  Lets see what we are dealing with before too much advice is given.  Charge ports spark if you plug them into the wall first btw.  Unplug it and plug it into the board first.  Then plug the wall plug in and switch it on.  Chargers retain voltage so leave it alone after unplugging it until the light goes out.  Takes a second or two.  Keep me posted, I love re purposing.

Thanks heaps for the encouragement man, yeah I'm Aussie haha, half the reason I went with this board is the lack of range in goods here, it's either eBay crap or top of the line stuff I drool over and can't afford unless I slave and save. Which I am doing, it was just sending me crazy not having something to cruise on in the meantime, I've been riding a normal board a lot but my legs suck and it's nice to give em a break.

Definitely the same hardware except I put it on a better deck.  Still crap.  It's in case a kid wants to ride a board or something.

Probably the best thing you can do with that -- besides keep it as an emergency backup or a trainer board --  is to find 21 higher-quality cells like 30Q or even 35E and replace the 7 cells in there with those.

But for all that work and cost, you could just build a better one like you said.

There really isn't much there you can use.

No, but mine has roll-to-start and auto-poweroff, so the power switch is an optional accessory.  Mine is an older model, though.

The worst case is if you accidentally short out some of those cells and they go into thermal runaway and start shooting fire.  That's the worst case.  You won't get shocked from any of it.  At least not very badly.

It was turning on when I rolled it, thought that was part of it being faulty. But yeah, it works fine when plugged in, soon as I unplug it it dies.
The battery pack seems to be glued in there with hot glue.

Check the voltage on the battery when it's not plugged in.  Don't accidentally short it.

Should be over 3.0V/cell (3\*7 = 21V total) and not over 4.2V/cell (4.2\*7 = 29.4V)

Got nothing to do that with right now, uhm the street was a little wet but the inside all seems dry and I was going up a mild incline when it messed up. My guess is the current running through the switch while pushing me up the hill shorted it.
Gonna jump on YouTube and find out how the switches are installed then uninstall it. If I set it without a switch I can just plug and unplug yeah? Not as good as a loop key but should work? If it's the battery I'll know next week when I get the replacement lipo pack.

Uhm, could it be loose connection? I was going over a red brick promenade when it messed up and this connection for the power switch looks a tad loose. I once pushed my new motorbike for an hour till I got to a streetlight, popped the seat off and realised I'd knocked the engine management thing loose.
Also noticed a kinda not good bit of soldering at the charge port.![15567924180561956361485|375x500](upload://1Eek0GngjCF3yKvQukHbxp5x2Dp.jpeg) ![1556792480447-522651977|375x500](upload://omCxfVxHDZoGt5iIlJEa1RcUTha.jpeg)

I was going to suggest if it had an antispark, that you replace it. I've only heard bad things about those cheap(er than most) Chinese ones. 

Can we see pictures of your esc? With the green paper off as much as possible?

It's also probably worth it to try and do some proper cable management.... Might help you diagnose your board at the very least

Can I replace this with a lipo equivalent and use a voltage alarm/balance charger?

Well yeah it's the same voltage, but it's also a completely different shape.

That pack in your board is made of 18650 cells, the round type.

Yeah I realised right after that it wouldn't fit in the battery case. At this point I'm thinking I'll get a couple of 3s lipo's and running them in series to get 6s. They'll definitely fit. 
the esc says 22v-50v so I'm guessing that won't be a problem though I might lose a bit of speed?
I'll be getting a balance charger and running the balance cables to a voltage alarm set in the board near the main case so I don't have to crack it open every time I charge.

While it may support various voltages, it may require you to reprogram it for the proper voltages (not possible) or to resolder some jumpers on the PCB to "manually" reprogram it.

This is really starting to feel like a classic case of throwing good money after bad. You're trying to resurrect a limited board instead of spending your time and money in a more beneficial direction.

You do you, but a used Wowgo or Ownboard would be 
a significant upgrade in power, reliability and range for not a lot of money.

exactly! I bought a similar board for my 5yo nephew , it at least had dual hubs, I got it cheap mainly for samsung cells in the battery - sadly I screwed up instantly and plugged the 7s into a 10s charger and destroyed all the cells - I was going to do something with this board but its sat in my junk box since its SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE TIME AND $$$ to fix.

Most likely all you did was kill the bms.  Remove it and the pack will probably come to life.  I have an old chinese 10s3p that I killed the bms on and it is still going strong,  in the board for a few months then now as my bench power supply.  Holds its balance through charges too.  Worth a go.

Okay, after all that I'm thinking you guys might be right, anything I buy to get it running is gonna be underpowered to use as spares for my next build. 
I'm in touch with the eBay seller, they want a video of the problem, hopefully once I do that they'll just send me a spare battery and I can use it till I have something better, if not I can at least keep the motor/trucks and parts case for my trick deck commuter, I only want that to cruise slowly to the park. Will I be able to re-pair the remote to a new reciever? 
Expensive mistakes are pretty much the only way I learn it appears.
Also if you guys have any suggestions on an affordable and reliable complete deck or hub kit that's available in Australia that'd be cool.
Thanks for putting up with the noob, I appreciate it.
