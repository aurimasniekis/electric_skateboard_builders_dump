Has anyone actually done this. I couldn't find any posts besides lipo ones. Obviously range would be less but theoretically would this affect the top speed much of just in general is it a viable/good idea?

What type of cells are you using? And I dont think 2p can supply enough amps to power 2 motors lol

that depends entirely on the cells. 

Samsung 25Rs could dump those kinds of amps easily. With some conservative ESC settings and some managed expectations you could still have a decent slurpee runner with a pack like that. Mind the brakes.

I'm looking at getting a complete battery pack with bms power switch etc. But the tb 12s4p back comes with an enclosure that's like 2.1"/5.5cm thick. That's just too much. I can't seem to find any other ready packs for a similar price. So I was looking at their 12s 2p pack.

densely packing cells into an attractive box is a challenge. Its difficult coming up with a one-size-fits-most solution that doesn't look chunky.
