I was thinking of possibly using these [APS 63100 Outrunner brushless motor 140KV 4500W](https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-63100-outrunner-brushless-motor-140kv-4500w/) from alien as an over kill board.
but the main issue is finding a 14s vesc, and recommendations?
i would run it at 14s if i can, i would make this into an ATB using a trampa deck with pneumatic wheels.

You did not set a budget so...

can you run 2 motors with that, or does it have to have all 3 running?

It is a single vesc. The reason for the multiple wires is to keep them flexible.
This means you will need two of them for a dual setup.
It was not designed as an esk8 specific controller hence the price and current capability

would you recommend running two single ones for a dual setup

Most of us are running 2 single vesc based escs for a dual setup.
The dual escs such as the Unity have only recently hit the market.

But one question, why not to run the motors on 12s? Whatâ€™s the problem?

i want more power, an i also want to test 14s out since i have a 12s board already

Ok.
You know the basics of repairing motors?
Because itâ€™s very likely that you will need that at one or the other aps motor ðŸ˜‰

Just for us craaazy boooyz who would even think of this, what causes them not to be durable?

Nothing about him or his uses

APS motors have a reputation for poor quality.

Most VESCs are rated to 60 volts. 14 times 4.2 is 58.8 so it would be possibility using a focbox or other vesc the problem is voltage spikes from braking so I think it would be okay if you ran 14s without breaks and used some disc breaks or something to stop. All that said I still wouldn't recommend 14s. 12 or 13s and high amps will get you plenty of power.

Hereâ€™s a good video of what to do if you get those motors, and the previously mentioned trampa 75v 300a would probably be the best VedderElectronicSpeedController, developed by Ben Jaminâ€™  Vedder.

Is there a special kind of epoxy that should be used? For my hub motors I would need something that can handle heat because it get really hot in there :P

Thatâ€™s good.
And they have a good customer service.
If something broke contact them, with a bit luck they will replace it.

Letâ€™s say, I have 9 of motors from them.
4 of them are broken.
1 had a broken magnet after I made motor detection.
1 had a defective bearing
2 others had broken magnets during the first 300km.
If you hit over 40km/h you get a high pitching noise from the 6384 motors I have.
Thatâ€™s all issues which can be fixed if you know how, but that shouldnâ€™t be non the less.

Other reported issues I heard from,
The retainer ring gets lose and slightly lose windings which cause strange noises while driving.
The 80xx motors donâ€™t have silicon phase wires and the big bearing seems to be low quality.


I would first check if the motors run without issues when you get them and then directly do what @ninTHIENdo already linked.
