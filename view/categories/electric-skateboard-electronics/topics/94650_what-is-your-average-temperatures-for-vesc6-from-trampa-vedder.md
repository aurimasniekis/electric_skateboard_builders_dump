Hello everyone, Im trying to gauge whether or not I will need an external heatsink to dump heat out of my enclosure or not when I get my VESC 6s. Frank says 'they dont get hot' but if I'm being honest, I'm skeptical.

 I mainly want a heatsink to avoid slow cooking my battery pack (the VESCs and battery will be fairly close to each other, and I want to keep the cells as healthy as possible), and to keep the VESCs as cool as possible.

Can you guys post some average temperatures please? Additional information about your builds(if the VESCs are exposed or sealed within an enclosure), Metr data or any other supporting information  would be appreciated :)

Mine have never gone over 50C unlike the motors which regularly reach 80-90C.

No heatsinks but the bottom of the vescs face the open air (old pic)

Thanks! 50c is pretty good, but thats with a side exposed to air :thinking:

65c is probably my limit on what I want to expose the cells to, so I guess Ill wait for more data points to roll in :P

I'm running the escapes fully enclosed in the haya deck with hubs, maxing out around 120 battery amps during hard acceleration and they never went more than 50 degrees.

Is there any correlation between cooler vesc and hubs? Vs hotter vescs and belts or gears? I feel like gearing probably plays a role

Thanks for your input though!

Hubs are less efficient in some moments 1 to 1 gear doesn't fit well in all situations, more power consumption

Why not just to start without. Get a cheap Bluetooth module and track your temperature. If you will exceed your set limit just add a heat sink. Donâ€™t make your life more complicated than it is ðŸ˜‰

What battery are you looking at?

Trampa has some lipo suggestions on their site.

Not really. I used to get my lipos from Hobbyking and I use liions on my esk8s that I make myself.

Here are 2 stores that sell lipos

I think I never saw mine above 58 CÂº deep inside a Hummie deck with no airflow and plastic enclosure

What was your issue with hobbyking? They sell pretty good lipos in what ever size you need. It was just about shipping?
