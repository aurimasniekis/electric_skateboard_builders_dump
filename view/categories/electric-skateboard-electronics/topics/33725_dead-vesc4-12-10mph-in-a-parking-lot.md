Do these things just fail randomly?  diyelectricskateboard doesn't even warranty them unless you buy a warranty for 2/3 the cost of a new one.  Which...of course I didn't, I didn't plan on pushing it too hard.  And... 80miles later it just dies doing 10mph in a parking lot.

"You have two choices, replace the DRV chip yourself, or Buy a new VESC"  

Pretty great Customer service!!!

I'm the 5th one among my group, others had been attributed to FOC, over voltage braking downhill on a fresh pack, and road dust.

If you can prove that the Vesc was damaged before you used it and that fault caused it to break. then you should be able to get a replacement.  99% of products that dont come with a warranty still come with buyers protection ( **depending on where you live** )  aka, if it arrived borked then its not your fault so you dont need a warrenty to protect you.

Mine also died 2 months in. BLDC mode nothing crazy ran fine then  one day nothing. Also have 2 other buddies that have 3 dead vesc also all within 2 months or less. Im thinking a bad batch or just shit components.

I think that everyone thinks that it's a good price at 100 dollars not realizing u can get a focbox for $40 more which has had much fewer issues and have yet to here of a burned direct fet or capacitor on them

@notepad, unfortunately it's got 80 miles on it.  So it's not like it was a "misconfiguration" issue, I've been riding! Nothing's changed, no road dirt, it's in a box on top of my deck, not overheated 44degrees, not wet.  Just not a good product I guess.  

@willpark16 Have you been using a focbox? people seem pretty happy with them? 

I'm looking at sending it in to some guy someone in the group knows for repair, but if that's just gonna be 40bucks down the drain...

Translation: Ollin and Axle VESC's have better mechanisms dealing with voltage spikes, FOC mode, and just overall breaking.  Not to mention Ollin VESC's come with a 2 year warranty

I ride foc on my foc boxes with zero issue, I switch between foc and Bldc daily, and have never encountered an issue, they are much better at dissipatingbheat and have fets instead of drvs, You can look through many threads but will find few of any customer complaints about them, highly reccomend these or an ollin but lately I think Olin has been a bit behind on some orders so if you want a fox box hit up @yummyblobs he's honest and legit and fulfills his orders with complete customer satisfaction

Yeah, but I think that is just due to the fact that more people on this forum buy from DIY Electric Skateboards rather than Maytech since everyone already knows Maytech is garbage.

I've had 2 DIY VESC's blow cruzing around at nothing more than 15mph, on flat ground. First one got me just down my street on the debut ride, and second lasted about 100 miles. Definitely something wrong with hardware or just poor quality over all. I was running pretty conservative settings as well.

Sadly I'm more American than anything. Can't even teach my child to speak the Chinese. She's probably just another broken Chinese product 

Nothing offends me which is probably why I "offend" others all the time

Good choice of word!  This has been going on a long time. All vesc's including FOCbox have had a high failure rate. Mostly due to user error. 

I've had muliple vesc's fail. Personally, I've burned out more Ollin and DIY than Maytech.  Chaka and @JohnnyMeduse can confirm this, because they did the repairs.

The funny thing is @mmaner and @psychotiller gave me a hard time when I joined the community as if the DIY escs were my fault.. 

Lol. But y'all are great, just funny every time I see these posts compared to other escs.. even the highly popular focbox...

Every dead VESC I've ever seen, doesn't include maytech as I've never had any, has been caused by user error or conditions.  What I am saying is that I have never seen a defective VESC, only VESC's that were broken by people not installing or configuring them correctly or installed so that environmental conditions, vibrations, electrical conditions, etc could have conceivably been the cause.  That's just my personal observations.

While id agree. I'd say setup a focbox and diy exactly the same with the same motors and see which one fails.

Have yet to see a focbox fail(locally) except one that had a cap shorted on the housing(Manu defect). Just my experience. But hey I like you and psycho, not wanting an argument just respecting our cumulative findings ;)

I would guess the TB would not last as long as a FocBox under abnormal conditions assuming those conditions are power input/output related, but that just because of the upgraded FET's on the FocBox.  As the TB VESC is a 1/3 cheaper, I feel like that's a pretty good trade-off.

Same here, I just tend to defend our retailers a bit vehemently as without them we would be locked down to HK crap, and that would just suck balls :slight_smile:.

Im mostly talking about the HK motor mounts and motors, not good imho.  As a consumer we tend to make assumptions that are not always correct.  Like the HK VESC is prolly crap because the motor mounts are crap.  

At the same time, I dont think anyone would argue that a HK VESC is better than a FocBox.  When I'm slinging my old ass down the road at 30mph on a rocket powered murder board I want the best equipment I can get :slight_smile:.
