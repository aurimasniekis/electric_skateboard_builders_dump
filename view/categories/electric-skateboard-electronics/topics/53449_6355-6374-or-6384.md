Hi

How big are the differences between 6355, 6374 and 6384?

I could fit dual 6384 on my tb 218mm Trucks, but I don't know If I should do it. Price is also no problem. So what would you do?
My Board is no mtb, just for the streets.

Thanks in advance.

If money is no problem go for the best  you can get, but a single 6374 will do the job just fine or even double 6355.

You get around the same amount of power on the 6374 and 6384 in a single drive form that you would get on a pair of dual 6355

I use a single 6374 and see no reason to upgrade.

If you have no hills, you don't weigh over 100kg and you don't want to drag race, dual 6355. 

6355 would save you some weight and you'll still have a lot of power. Only thing is that it kinda looks weird on a 218 truck.

To be honest, even dual 5065 feel powerful, but 6374 is where all the fun begins! So if you are after a seriously powerful board, (it'll most likely throw you off the first couple of times) get 6374. I feel like 6384 will be a waste.

If I was you i would go for a dual 6374. A single 6374 is for a guy of 60kg more than enough.

I'm running dual 6374 on 12s and I've yet to encounter a production board that has half the amount of torque my board has and I own a Raptor 2..

I know people have faster boards here but production boards are years and years behind when it comes to power and range.

If you talking about two of these bad boys on a longboard
http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-6384s-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-170kv-4000w/

Yeah they will fit on a 218 hanger

MAX POWER: 4000W
TORQUE: 4.5 NM

Let's put that into a calc
![image|626x189](upload://w8xvZ2nirFu3DATO7tlavEcQrYi.png)

So effectively you will create a longboard which could weigh anything between 10-30kg depending on board and battery and mechanicals choosen. Even if it were really heavy 30kg it would still be a third of the weight of a moped with the same power, and remember you don;t have anythign to hold onto...footgrip and position.

Outside of ATB there's little point and increases the risk of injury for sure..powerslide anyone?

You might run into trouble using two 6384s as there are no trucks out there that can handle them side by side. Maybe as a diagonal setup on a Torqueboards 218 mm? Or you could get yourself a set of the soon to be released Arbor trucks if @GrecoMan gets his stuff together :slight_smile:

How did you do that? Got a model for it? This is the width I need pulley to pulley. 
Distance between the inner bearings is approx. 254 mm which you might squeeze to 248 or so max.

Wouldnt you be able to get a bit more belt space if you shave the wheels down so it would be smaller on the motor side? Like remove enough so its flush with the rim of the wheel .

Similar to our 6374. Sensored, Rubber bearings instead of metal shield bearings. Bigger stator size it's a 6384 in a 6380 size. You should be able to run Dual 15mm on it (at least with our motor mounts). Entry Price should be about $130. What other info were you looking for?

It's funny that nobody in this thread talks about the motor max and battery max settings. Because that defines how powerful your motors will be.
Especially when somebody says that his motors don't have enough power.

6355 can be very powerful but if you leave the motor max low a bigger motor won't make a difference. 

@ARetardedPillow what are your settings and which battery do you use?

APS 6384(true 84mm) fits on tb218s with TB mounts and 20mm metroboard pulleys... Leaves you with 2mm between the pulley and motor mount, and 5mm between the motor butts. So about 1cm of clearance, Between all.

This is similar clearance to 180 trucks I've setup with 15mm belts on dual 6355s. It's tight but doable :slight_smile:

Edit: just to clarify, this only works with 83mm flywheels, or 107s Superfly. As 90 and 97mm flywheels are not offset they are centerset. Until 90 and 97 Superfly come out. Don't try this with them lol..

Nice I missed that post scrolling through. But yeah if you run 15mm instead of 20s, that's still quite a bit of room 9mm from the setup I mentioned + 8 shorter motors, + 10(-5 per pulley).so should still have a little over an inch of clearance between all. 

But really, new bigger motors ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

It will depend on what battery you are going to fit.

The 6355 are 2200W you need 81A motor max, 10S4P battery with 30Q would be recommended. 

The 6374 are 3200w you need 87A motor max, 10S5P battery with 30Q would be recommended. 

The 6384 are 4000w you need 108A motor max, 10S6P battery with 30Q or even better a 12s4p with a maximum motor max set at 90A

Motor max isn't necessarly related to the battery's max amps. It only depends for battery max.
In theory you could raise motor max even for a 6355 to 120A with a decent esc. Question is if you really want that. One the one side it's impressive to have that power and on the other side the board needs to be rideable. I prefer 80 or 90 motor amps each for a dual drive with a reduced throttle curve at the beginning. 
Could go higher but then the the power can let you loose your balance. Depends on if you want to race or enjoy the ride.

And if I want more or less power it only is a few clicks away with the app.

[/quote]

While the TB hanger is 218mm it has long 48mm axles so you can space it out for different wheels pulleys mounts etc. 

84mm motors will fit but the axle nut will be very close to the end of the thread so I would not advise it. 74mm motors will fit fine with 15mm belts a gap between the motors and a safe amount of threads left on the axles.

Decky so i use TB vescs, apparently rated for 50A batt max. I wanna run 40A batt max for more power, i plan on increasing motor max from 70A to 80A. Also gearing from 16/36 to 16/40. You think the batt max upping would be safe? Iâ€™m currently running 30A per vesc. @torqueboards if you can chime in. I just put it in this thread cause i didnâ€™t wanna make a whole new one

Edit: @Deckoz

the only issue I have with my TB vesc is heat.... I have my battery, vesc and antispark in the same box and its not uncommon for me to hit 80c, and im only running 30a batt max and 80 motor max.... how are your vescs holding up(temperature wise, of course)?

maybe mine is defective? lol.... still toots like a champ though :man_shrugging:

Well Iâ€™m in Houston where we have 100+Fahrenheit. Mines never gone above like 57celcius even with partially hilly terrain. Granted my enclosure isnâ€™t airtight and i have a sizeable gap in the back for air flow. So i donâ€™t think temp would be a problem even with the dual 6374 drawing like a champ

Mine Focboxes get into thermal throttling pretty quick in the midday heat when I am getting after it...

Hi everyone, 

Iâ€™m about to build my 2nd board and want to try with belt drive system (my previous built are dual hub from diyeboard with 10s2p). I still can not decide which setup i sud go with, single 6374 or dual 6355. Will be running 10s3p Samsung 30Q, 90mm wheels, 15/36 or 15/32 pulley ratio. Weight about 46kg. 

I know that single 6374 more than enough for me, do you guys think that iâ€™ll need dual 6355 for any reason. I do have read about the the advantages/disadvantages about them, just want to know what you guys think. ðŸ˜‹

Dual for the traction. Acceleration and braking is much better purely because of both rear wheels being driven.

Dual for redundancy and safety (brakes).

Go 10s4p if you can. Less stress, things will last longer and behave better.

I agree with the dual part however at 46kg IMO 10s3p will be more than enough.

Hey all..
Anybody know the exactly the algorithm of vesc?
I have dual 6374 and use rc esc, thats very powerful with 15/36 90 mm wheels with 52km/hr tops speed , and massive torque, i use 12s lipo 4200mah 40c..when i upgrade to vesc seems it lost the power, i already set to max current 140a bat current 80a still dont equal to rc esc, the problem with rc esc that dont have good brake algorithm..
Anybody can help?

Well, you shouldn't be messing around with your max current, that should stay at 130a

You should probably search a little bit on how to confirgure a vesc

Here's a start: [Link](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-vesc-user-read-this-complete-walktrough-of-the-vesc/2980)

The values you should be changing are 

motor max

Motor min

Battery max 

Battery min

As well as setting your cutoff values properly, checking to ensure your preferences on can vs ppm are set correctly, and please do motor detection. There's no reason to not, and every reason to

Also, please link me to the vesc you have because different hardware versions of the vesc have differing rated power values, you don't want to pop the DRV by putting too much through it

I use fsesc6.6 with max dual burst upto 800, so 300a burst is safe..motor detection already..my previous esc have max 120a each..

I can't help but I totally agree with you

[Getting power from ESCs based on VESC6](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/getting-power-from-escs-based-on-vesc6/88869)

Only few seem to believe :roll_eyes:
