Okay so basically i set out to make a better way to keep my lipo chargers. Previously i just had them permanently on a bench but after moving recently I'm short on space <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/c/8cafd223e8aa5a436e9a623d61976bb1d6c4d727.jpg" width="690" height="388"> my old charging setup

 I decided to go with a plastics box (pelican ripoff)

It successfully holds a 1200w server powersupply and 3 chargers. 

Because i live in a very hot climate i also added 4 60mm 12v fans all pushing into the box and out the powersupply adding ti its own fan.

I will be adding (when it shows up) heatsink to the powersupply and chargers.

That is the finished results atm. Still needs a usb charging port, voltage indicator and exra 12v ports to hook up more chargers. Also a voltagein so i can power it off a battery if i want 

Anything i should add or have missed?

sweet.

maybe leave a bit of space for the lipos to rest while charging?

a quick voltage check station? Build that blue cell checker top right in pic#1 into the case somewhere

Yea that's a good idea thanks. normally im only charging 1300mah packs ( racing drone) so it has plenty of room. Anything larger  to much larger will only be 1 pack per charger
