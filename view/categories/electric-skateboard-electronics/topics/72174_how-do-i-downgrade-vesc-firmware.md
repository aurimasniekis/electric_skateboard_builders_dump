Im trying to downgrade my focbox firmware from 3.40 to 3.39 as part of troubleshooting some problems with my setup. Does the vesc tool come with the older versions of the firmware stored somewhere? If not where do I download the old firmware versions? 

 This seems like a common question so I'm sure someone will be able to link the info I need even though I couldn't find it. Sorry if that's the case.

You can find them in Vedder's GitHub page, https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/tree/master/build_all just click on history and browse to the version you want.

Seems that is just all the built firmwares for the latest version. I don't see a catalog of old versions.

I don't want to lose the ability to use Bluetooth and metr.

Like @Wajdi mentioned can just go through the history on the github to see any version in the history of the git repository https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/commit/a20c35b33863b85bc5a11b80d30e4df3d8066cc3#diff-00a64554bd590b5d21cdd76c4998d52c

Think you can just hit view button there on the one for appropriate hardware and then hit download button on the top right of the 'file view'

For 4.10 4.11 and 4.12 HW versions would be this one:

Oh wow. I'm dumb. I didn't expect the commits to be organized so well. That worked perfectly. Thank you. Too bad downgrading the firmware didn't help me figure out my canbus problem.  ðŸ˜’

With ackmainac's firmware in the past I have had problems connecting with Android and through other apps then just ackmainac's.
