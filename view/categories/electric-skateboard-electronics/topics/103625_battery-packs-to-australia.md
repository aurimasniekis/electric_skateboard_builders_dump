Long time reader first time poster.
I'm looking at building up a board mostly with a kit.  There's quite a few posts about issues posting battery packs to Australia, but none recently.  Quite a few sites say they still can't do it.
Has anyone had battery packs posted to Oz recently and were there any issues?  
Can get them made here it seems, but slightly easier not to mess around with the kits when everything will fit etc.

Why? We have Marsen, Tinnie Sinker, Glyph, Zillboards, @Tony_Stark all building batteries here in Oz.

Zill boards is in Sydney and did a few 18650 packs for us Sydney siders. He's doing mainly custom graphene-oxide lipos which are bloody awesome!

Here is a build post with those batteries and a pic of the individual lipos. I had them custom made to be 3x12s1p packs that just fit into the Evolve GT enclosure.![20190818_143320|281x500](upload://uoFs2wXOuK2XllIYwqatUkZITP8.jpeg)

I didn't expect so many replies.  It's more a matter of it just being easier to get the battery as part of a kit for a relative newbie so I know it fits, is compatible etc.  

Looks like I should be getting one from Oz in any case.  Thanks everyone.
