Try [Jacob's site](http://vesc.net.au/). It's a little more intuitive. If you don't want to deal with terminal in ubuntu, go that route

Ok, cool, now I have the BLDC tool on my screen, I turned on the Vesc, plugged it in to the computer, and nothing... It is like the computer does not even see the vesc....

The only mini usb I have at the moment is the charging cable for the Enertion controller, I wonder if this is a power only cable?
