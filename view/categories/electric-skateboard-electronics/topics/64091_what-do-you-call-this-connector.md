What do you call this connector? Where can we buy it? And how much Amps can it handle?

You might try contacting Koolwheel for their source of these connectors

Looks like they took a DB9 housing and potted 2@ 3mm connectors into it.  I don't think it's off the shelf.

That connector gave me a lot of problem. I changed to a XT60. Cheap and strong. No disconnection problem anymore

Has anyone designed an enclosure system like the koowheel for 3d printing?
