I'm looking to build my own electric long-board and I need some advice/help before I go ahead and buy all my parts, fist Id like to know everything I need to build one, second of all... I don't know the difference between what a VESC, ESC, FOCBOX, Etc. 

**Here's what I'm thinking so far:**

**Trucks:**
Caliber Trucks Cal II 50° RKP Longboard Trucks  (set of two)
**Batteries:**
ZIPPY Flightmax 8000mAh 3S1P 30C Lipo Pack with XT90 (5 of them or 6)
Gens ace 5000mAh 11.1V 3S 50C 3 Cell LiPo Battery Pack with XT60 and Deans Plug (OR THESE)
**Bushings:**
Venom Bushings - High Performance Formula
**Wheels:**
MBS All-Terrain Longboard Wheels 100mm
**Motor mount:**
TOURQUE BOARDS BOLT ON MOTOR MOUNT W/ DRIVE WHEEL KIT (x2)
**Motors:**
Hobbysky 6374 170KV 190KV Brushless Outrunner Belt Motor 8mm /10mm Shaft (Two)
**Remote:**
Not sure if somone could plug a good remote that would be nice :slight_smile:
**VESC,ESC,FOCBOX:**
Don't know the difference between the three and whats best for the board

That's all i have so far... do I need anything else and is the parts list good??
**P.s** If there are any better battery options for long range let me know!!

If all goes well, I'll create a build topic that people can follow and watch progress!

This inclusion in your list is a very clear example that you my friend need to do a hell of a lot more reading.  Its all here just use the search and do your research.  Welcome to the forum and good luck with the studying.

Acually, If I'm being honest I know a basis of what a VESC is, Its the brain of the board and controls everything and speed or what not I just dont know the difference between VESC,ESC, and FOCBOX

@ethanfields  just fyi, standard builds are 10s and 12s because VESC are rated for 60V max . 12s puts it at 50.4V at full charge. some of use do 13s at 54.6v but when you break, voltage can spike over 4-5V. default overvoltage protection is at 57V, so if you hit 57 it cutoff.

I have hit 58v personally by raising that limit but that's me. me take risk for POWAAAR . As a beginner, I suggest you go with 10s or 12s.

I would highly recommend 10S (42.0V max, 37V nominal) and definitely not more and probably not less.  This means you either need an even number of "5S" lipos or you need a multiple of 5 quantity of "2S" lipo.

If you want 12S instead (I *personally* don't recommend this) then you need multiples of 4 times "3S" or multiples of 3 times "4S" or even numbers of "6S"

Also you don't want to mix and match them.  Get them all at the same time from the same place, and all the same kind.

Out of curiosity, why don't you recommend 12s? Or are you just not recommending 12s for a first time builder?

I don't recommend it on any ESC that uses a DRV83xx series part, like all the VESC4 and VESC6 motor controllers.

How much do you weigh?  30+ miles on flat or with hills?  You definitely want 10S at about 25Ah+ then

Then you can get that with 15Ah at 10S

Okay sweet! And do you think the massive motors I chose for the build will shred alot of the battery life?

I've never heard of Hobbysky 6374 but as long as you stay 100kv to 190kv you should be okay.

You get what you pay for, so don't buy cheap motors, because you will get cheap motors.

What the continuous current rating on the battery?  Who makes it?  I'd be worried about vibration resistance on any battery that's not specifically designated as being for a skateboard.

This isn't really that high but it's not so low you can't use it.  However, the other more important questions all remain....

You don't want to spend multihundreds on a battery just to have it burn down on the twentieth ride

What about a few of these batteries? (4-6 of them?)
# Gens ace 5000mAh 11.1V 3S 50C 3 Cell LiPo Battery Pack with XT60 and Deans Plug

Specifications:

- Minimum Capacity: 5000mAh

- Configuration: 3S1P / 11.1V / 3Cells

- Discharge Rate: 50C

- Max Burst discharge Rate: 100C

- Net Weight(±20g): 380g

- Dimensions: 155.3mm x 46.3mm x 24mm (L x W x H)

- Charge Plug: JST-XHR

- Discharge Plug: Deans and XT60 plug

Would 4-6 of these give good range?

I would recommend getting an even number of "5S" ones instead of 3S ones

You do want to make sure they are at least 30C, the higher, the better

For such a long-range pack the C rating is *slightly* less important

I would look at hobbyking lipos if you want to go that route
