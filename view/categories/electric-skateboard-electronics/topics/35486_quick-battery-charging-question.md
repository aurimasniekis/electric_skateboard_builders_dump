So I got a quick battery charging question for you guys. I recently built my own 10S 5P battery pack out of 3000 mAh LG H2 li-ion 18650 and was wondering what's the charging Ah equivalent of charging this pack in 1C? I'm looking at the [Evolve 4A fast charger](https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/products/super-fast-battery-charger) and I want to know if this charger would be fine for this pack..and if it will damage it over time. Thanks!

1C is 15 amp for your pack (5 x 3000mah = 15 aH), so you're more than safe with a 4a charger
