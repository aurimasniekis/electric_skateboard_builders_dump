As most of you know, exway make pretty good boards, but their range absolutely suck due to the small pouch battery. So I wondered if I can just remove the guts and transfer them to a different deck with a bigger battery. so pretty much replacing the deck and the batteries for extended range.
Do you think is possible?

I thought the Exway had 18650 cells?

Yeah but they don’t get you very far. If you’re smart rider you can get the 14 to the 16 miles but going in the second speed, that’s like 20km/h. If you go in the fourth gear, that’s like 4 to 5 miles at 42km/h
Very fun but short.
