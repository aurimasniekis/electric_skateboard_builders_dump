Hey Guys,

I've got a trauma over here with 4x3s 8000mah lipos.
It is time for a battery upgrade to Samsung 30q since I don't trust lipos that much.

I can't choose between a 10s6p pack or a 12s5p pack.

I am running a dual motor set-up with 2 149kv sk3 motors. With E-toxx system(direct drive?)

Use 2 focboxes.

Also any safety tips configuring the focboxes? With this kind of pack? Or isn't it anything special?

Hello ! 

You need to choose between speed or range, 10S6P should give you more range but a lower max speed than a 12S5P.

Generally the type of Esc is a good help because some of them may not handle 12S for a long time use but I think that focboxes can manage it.

12s5p is the choice for you, same if not better range, faster top speed, more efficient, less amps required, running closer to motor efficiency range of 8k rpm and more punchy torque.

However 10s is more reliable

Wrong! they have the same amount of cells in the packs therefore the same Watt hours, therefore the same range. However 12s will use less amps due to higher voltage meaning more range.

[/quote]

I'd question that statement.  So long as you use the correct vesc then there is nothing wrong with 12s reliability.  See me being me would run a 10s 4p pack at max amps and then ride it like I stole it.  With the 12s 4p to get the same punch the current can be lower and therefore less stressful on the set up.  Also I tend to not flat stick 12s everywhere because that way lies madness.  Had more vesc fails on 10s set ups than 12 so far.  Remains to be seen whether this will play out in the long term as this 12s is only a few months old.  It definitely doesn't run the motors as hot though compared to the same parallel 10s.  Just saying so far so good.  

I've just put the kiss of death on my 12s set up now though with that statement.  :grimacing:

12s will run a higher risk blowing up the FOCBoxes (but that chance is still pretty small) in exchange for a higher max speed. To reduce this risk, I'd recommend undercharging the pack by one or two volts to 48-49V.

More cells in parallel means higher battery current settings (depending on how you ride, this may not make much of a difference).

What hardware version and current settings are the VESCs running, also what was the failure mode and use rate between 10s and 12s? When my friend switched to FOC on a 12s4p setup, one of his VESCs immediately died. 
MOSFETs are only rated for 60V, meaning transients will trigger avalanche breakdown (the IR fets, despite their poor electrical characteristics, actually have really rugged avalanche characteristics) and the DRV830x is only rated for 65V on VIN and phase nodes.
12s fully charged barely passes the 20% headroom rule. This is why DRV failures are not uncommon at 12s.

Not game to run 12s foc even on focboxes.  Too many horror stories.  I like reliable and don't need the bells and whistles that come with foc.  I build very simple set ups for this reason.   **K**eep it **S**imple **S**tupid **S**afe.  Works for me.  
The 12s is running the latest version of the foc boxes but I did have a drv fail when I ran some HK 4.12 for a while. I was at the testing stage so was pushing the current settings too hard.  Hard braking etc for science.  Focboxes are imo the most reliable 4.12 vesc derivative and its just my opinion based on experience before the inevitable flurry of replies.  Once something works for me I stick with it because if its not broke don't fix it.

According to all the tests and Alan eboosted they are the tits.  Been scouring the vapers for info and they can safely discharge up to 40amps.  Thats crazy.  They state 35a but as the 30q states 15a and we all run them safely at 20a  Bigger size 21700 but when you factor in less P it makes sense.  More dollars though

That's not entirely true.  If the 12S can offer more acceleration then in theory you could use the same amount but in reality, you will use more which means less range.

No. what it is, is that some of the bms's they sent me like to stay at nominal voltage. So, if you charge your board to 4.2v per cell and ride it works perfectly. If you charge to full voltage and let your board sit for a month it will take your cells back down to 3.6v per cell. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it means your bms always feels warm until it gets back to nominal. just annoying really, because it's not what I friggen ordered!!

The way to check is fully charge your pack. check the voltage to confirm it's 100%. Then wait 10 or 15 minutes. Feel the bms. If it's cool to the touch you're good! If not we can switch it out if you want. (when I get new Beemusses)

The new 6 type vescs, focboxes, and unities are great with 12s anyway.

I'd say go 10s. 60 cells is 60 cells.

*EDIT* Not worth your time

I have an honest question. Do you guys think the electric skateboard industry will gear more towards more and more distance? Once you hit 35mph on a board, very few people are willing to go over that. But it seems like we're limited by the amperage of ESCs as far as I can tell. How can we break through to 13s or 14s, etc? Real commuter vehicles.

There are far more failures that I know of using 12s compared to 10s. 
Don't know why but it seems like a hit or miss. 
Been using 10s for over 1000km with zero problems. 
I would go 10s if you are on a budget and want reliability, 12s if you like power and can comprise on reliability. This is my opinion and experience. 
Will probably be bashed now after this post...

These 2 terms are not mutually exclusive in my opinion.  I run 10s and 12s and both seem to be the same reliability wise.  Used 10s for longer though so had more failures but thats time related.  Actually had more failures running 8s back in the day but that was due to ignorance.  So many factors at play its a really a moot point.    
Do you run 12s?

*EDIT* Not worth your time

I've only seen what people have been talking about on here. I haven't seen anything above 12s, so I was wondering why it wasn't more popular. Especially with the DIY community. For me, a commuter vehicle can go all the way across the city and back. 20, maybe 30 miles per charge. I may be wrong about what the limits are, I just haven't seen anything above 12s yet. And I haven't been here that wrong either, which was why I asked in the first place. I'd be interested in the boards you're talking about

? donÂ´t get what you want to ask. more more 3p, 5p, 20p doesnÂ´t have an influence on the vesc. just with 3p your constant current you can run through your vesc is smaller than with 5p or 10p of the same cells.

for sure not.
with your 12s5p you would have 100a constant discharge from the pack.
so max battery max setting at 50a per vesc (depending on your vesc, some should set only to 35a)

12s5p -> Will have no problems seeing my current set-up
Both focboxes should be set to -> 50a bat max Which also means i put 50A in motor max?

It still doesn't matter if I run in FOC nor BLDCS?
Don't even know anymore what my current settings are.

But following this will have no issues at all?

if you set up your focboxes right, there shouldnÂ´t be a higher setting at the moment with the old lipo.
you set the bat max value always (maximum) to the constant current rating of your battery /2 (if you run dual). if your your max output ability of your pack exceed the vesc rating  (for example a 10p pack) than you set it for sure on the max constant current your vesc can handle (or lower).

your motor max you can set to the max rating of your motors.
idk which motors you use and for which current they rated.

you can run focbox in FOC and 12s.

So battery max = 50A
Motor max = 70A

And that will be Okay

should work!
just have a look that your bat min value is not over the top.
i would start with -10A per focbox

Okay just had a small talk.

I heard that -4A per p is the max so for safety reasons i use -3A per p
Mening a battery min of -15A

I have to focboxes so that means -15/2 = -7.5A per focbox?

And you told me to set the battery max on 50A
Does that also mean in the focbox settings i do
75/2 = 37.5A per focbox or 75A per focbox since a 12s would have 75A discharche

[quote="SynteX, post:65, topic:80810"]
-4A per p is the max
[/quote]
yes but this value is for a full charge cycle 2.5V-4.2V.
you think you can break that long? I guess you need a very very long hill for this.
10A is a good value (thatÂ´s my opinion) probably you will anyhow never reach that value....

[/quote]
how you come to it?
i guess i know from where.
idk who you was talking with but this person told you that the 30q rated to 15a.
so 5+15a is 75a.
but the 30q are 20a cells, not 15a cells.
nothing bad with 37.5A, always better less than too much, but you can set the values to 50A (again my opinion).
If you not sure, read a bit in here, use the search function and than set it to what ever you think is right.

one more thing, with a 10s4p 30q you would have your 75A too same with 8s4p or even with 1s4p.
if somebody told you the discharge capabilty depents on the S count than you better doing your own research.

iÂ´m not fan of posting facebook links... but i couldnÂ´t find the website and i donÂ´t want to search any longer.
here is a real life test with the 30q,
https://www.facebook.com/batterymooch/posts/samsung-30q-3000mah-18650a-great-15a20-batterybottom-line-this-is-a-retest-of-th/2018668968422679/

so in fact you can use them as 20a cell.
read a bit here about cells and there rating and you will understand why i chose the values i chose.

... And you will find that 15A rating in nearly every store that sells these cells, because that's the OFFICIAL amp rating that Samsung has decided to put on the specs sheet for this cell. Real life testing sais what Andy has said already, ie that these cells can safely deliver up to 20A as long as temp is kept at normal levels.

No seriously I thought you have a big lipo battery pack.Something like 4p graphens.
No?

Not yet, I will have a 12s3p pack and for long distance rides an external pack for charging while riding.

@Allofyoush we could have this same discussion about using 12S or 14S on [VESC 7](https://www.trampaboards.com/single-vesc-75v-300a-in-cnc-t6-silicone-sealed-aluminum-box--the-most-powerful-vedder-electronic-speed-controller-ever-p-26293.html) but this is about 10S or 12S on VESC 4-6 and clones

Boom!!  Do not mess about there my man!!  Just don't push the battery amp settings with this set up or whatever 4.12 vesc variant will not like it.  Focboxes will handle it on paper but I personally try to keep everything under by at least 10.  Wiggle room.
