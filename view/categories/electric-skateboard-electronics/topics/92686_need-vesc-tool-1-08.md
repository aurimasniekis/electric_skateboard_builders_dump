Hey there,

Can anyone help me out with a download link for the 1.08 VESC Tool software.

Buddy who just got all his components is having a fault with the new firmware that seems to be a common issue and would like to try a downgrade to 3.54 as has been recommended in a few threads regarding the issue.

I read I could compile an old version from GitHub but I am not sure how that works at all and very unfamiliar with specifics of that platform. If someone is willing to explain that, I am more than happy to do it myself.

Thanks guys!
