Any vesc :) But to reduce shipping, etc. I would definitely go for the Vesc-x. It's the best vesc out there atm.

Ga toch voor een gewone vesc. In Europa is het wat lastig om die te vinden, wat is je budget?

Just go for a vesc. In Europe its quite tricky to find a cheap vesc. What's your budget?

If you're referring to the group buy , then they have VESC 4.12. Enertion is the only one that offers a "VESC-X", which is their trade name for the VESC 4.12 but with slightly different components.
