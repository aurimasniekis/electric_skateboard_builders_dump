You need to remove the broken pins by pressing on the retaining tab with a pin. Then buy replacement crimp inserts and install. 
A not very strong bodge would be to solder to the crimps. You will need to remove them from the plug first. Make sure you get the wires in the right order.

If you’ve got a spare plug kicking about then wire to wire soldering and a bit of heat shrink will get you on the road again.
