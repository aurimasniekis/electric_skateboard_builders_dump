Hey, so I'm looking into a motor for a build I'm making. Some experienced builders say the Tacon Bigfoot motor is better, but in the pictures alot of builders are using turnigy Sk3 motors... Though the Bigfoot is cheaper... Thoughts?

I beat the crap out of my old Tacon.. I bet the thing would still run today if I have it juice.

I have run a Tacon 160 and a Tacon 110 and they were both great!

My board has dual Tacon 160's. I have no experience with the Sk3's but I feel my Tacon's are plenty powerful. I have no regrets.
