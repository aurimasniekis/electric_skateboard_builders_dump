Hey everyone,

I am having some problems with my BMS setup.
I went for a charge only BMS and set everything up according the wiring schematics in the image below.
But my batteries don't seem to charge. What am I doing wrong here?

Not sure to be honest, your wiring looks good. Maybe double check all connections again and if nothing is found you may have a bad bms

Is there anyway I can check if my BMS is bad?

I unplugged my balance wires and it is charging now. Could that mean my balance wires are in the wrong order?

Thanks for your help!
I checked the voltage on my balance wires:

1. 4 V
2. 7.6 V
3. 10 V
4. 14 V
5. 17.4 V
6. 17.4 V
7. 21 V
8. 24.3 V
9. 28 V
10. 31.7 V 

The values seem oke right? So would the BMS be broken than?

Did you plug them in that order?
Make sure that your 1-5 wires come from the battery that supplies the negative lead to your esc
