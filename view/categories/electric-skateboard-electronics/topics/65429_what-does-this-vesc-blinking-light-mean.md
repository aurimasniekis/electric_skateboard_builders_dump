What does it mean when my VESC blinks blue several times and then The led light turns off? The power switch is bright upon switching it on than dims.

I’m using the ownboard 4ah 10s2p battery. I have not gotten my esk8 up and running yet. Right now I’m having problems connecting the VESC to the computer to program the Vesc. I’m trying to troubleshoot all possible causes. I believe the battery has a BMS on it. I’m wondering if the Vesc is not receiving power and that is why my computer won’t connect to it. I’ve already downloaded and installed all the drivers and also bought a new data mini usb cable.

First picture is when the VESC is not plugged into the power source. Notice how much brighter the LED is.

Second Picture is when the VESC is plugged into the power source. Notice how the LED is less brighter.
