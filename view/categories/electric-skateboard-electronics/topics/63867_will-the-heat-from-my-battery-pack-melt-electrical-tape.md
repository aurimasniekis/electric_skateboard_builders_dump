I know electrical tape is usually good to around 500F, I could buy better heat resistant tape but don’t want to unless I have to.

All the red circles I have are electrical tape covering up wires that I soldered together.

Just want to make sure the heat won’t melt and cause a short/fire.

The answer to look up is the max temperature a li-ion cell can handle before thermal runaway. 500F is 260 Celsius. You'll lose your pack before saving the electrical tape.

I'd say the adhesive is more of an issue. The tape might hold a high temperature, but the tape starts to unwrap easily/easier if the adhesive heats up.
