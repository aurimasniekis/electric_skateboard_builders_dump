Hello,

I am building my first 18650 pack. Now, I have seen a lot of people building 10s4p batteries. Since I am thinking about building another smaller travel board, I would like to be able to take my pack apart, so that I have 4 packs. Either 10s1p or 5s2p. Then they will be less than the max. of 160Wh that you can take on a airplane.  Now my question is, if there is any issues with that? There will be only one cable connecting each batterypack together.

I don't think that'll be an issue. Just make sure you have a solution for your balance cables and bms too. This is basically what you would do with lipo packs
