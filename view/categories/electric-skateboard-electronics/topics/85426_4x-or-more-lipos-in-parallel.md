so I was searching online for a harness that could handle 4x xt60's but there were none... (1x xt60 to 4x xt60)

The only solution I came across was this:
https://usa.banggood.com/XT60-Plug-Lipo-Battery-Parallel-Charging-Adapter-Board-for-RC-Model-p-1338537.html?gmcCountry=US&currency=USD&createTmp=1&utm_source=googleshopping&utm_medium=cpc_bgcs&utm_content=zouzou&utm_campaign=pla-usg-rm-all-purchase-pc&cur_warehouse=CN
So im wondering if the board can handle high current draw (probably not) and would someone be able to make a board that can handle high currents? maybe thick copper PCB?

And would something like this be suitable for spot welding (boss welder) (just broke my 10s3p 3 days ago... fml)

I have 4 zippy 2200mah 30c 3s flighmax that I would like to use in parallel, and I know I can just use 3 xt 60 harnesses (1xt 60 to 2 xt60 to make one for 4 lipos but that just seems sketchy)

Making them in to a 12s1p or 8s2p

uh, i said paralell... :rofl:

so it would become 8800mah 3s 120c lipo

Yep... :grinning:

i think the @aulakiria spot welder should get real strong welds with 120c

4s really isnt going to give you much in speed. 6s only give about 15-17mph. You know this right?

That makes more sense lol. So why not just solder up your own paralell plug with xt60'

because soldering 4 10awg wires to a xt60 or a xt90 would be presumable hard

thats why im wondering if a pcb can handle high currents because it would be much cleaner

You would use 5 connectors... One for total output and the other four for paralelling them. Follow me?

Yep, it‚Äôs easy to make. You just need a nice fat tip and good soldering iron.

Just clamp them together, strip enough wire. Twist it, and solder one at a time. Tons of flux and solder, good joints are important.

Then pot it or tape it.

@evoheyax @Sn4pz @J0ker3366

Thanks for the help guys, im still super parodied about my connector even after using copper 10awg wire  and a ton of solder

@Sn4pz but at least when i think about what this guy did to his focbox bullet connectors i feel better about myself sorry @Sn4pz :rofl::man_facepalming::grimacing:

You should be fine. Just make the connector before hooking it up to your battery (don‚Äôt do it on a live battery, neg and pos are way to close together haha). Then there‚Äôs no immediate risk and you can check it after. Once you have a good connecttion, treat yourself like an artist with the solder. You want to brush it to smooth it out. A lot of heat is really important for this, thus why a good soldering iron is a good invest. It‚Äôs not about max temp, but maintaining the correct temp.

[quote="AlanZhou, post:1, topic:85426"]
probably not
[/quote]

That's indeed a nope. These boards are meant for hobby chargers and those rarely surpass 20a.

You might be better of just using a car battery if you want some big amps :slight_smile:

Copper bus bars would be your easiest solution and replace the xt60s with crimped connectors, then on the other side something like AS150 or any connector that can handle as much amps as possible

i mean the boss welder wont pull that many amps anyways @Acido , if we go off of specs this setup can pull 1000+ amps which is more than most car batteries @Friskies
