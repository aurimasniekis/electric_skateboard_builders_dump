Since I'm new to configuring VESC and didn't see anything specific about this, i thought i'd start a thread for it for myself and anyone else. 

I want to start from a stand still without kicking, but it seems like my motors are just jittering as i slowly pull the trigger. When i kick and squeeze, its fine. But i want to not have to kick.  How do i do this? I'm not running sensored motors, so is it possible without them?

I've got twin R-SPEC 6355s on here  and I'm using FW 2.7 FOC.

That's interesting. I've never used a vesc, but I thought one of it's selling points was good startup torque using a special algorithm. Maybe the algorithm doesn't apply to foc.

@longhairedboy I'm not the resident VESC expert, but I've been using one for a few months and with single motor I have always been able to take off from a standstill with only the tiniest bit of "jitter" when using the motor in "BDLC" mode. I'm assuming you've run the config for each motor already, correct?

Just last night I started using FOC mode and it's the smoothest startup I've ever experienced. If you haven't tried FOC already, start there!

You can bump up the "startup boost" value a tiny bit and that might get you moving from a standstill more easily.

Also, are you giving the throttle enough juice to get moving? I've found that w VESC the throttle curve is very progressive. Can you get moving if you "gun it" a little more?

Huh, I can start from a standstill no problem with the VESC and a single enertion 6355.

I'll post a video this weekend (if I get to it)

ok Sorry for the false alarm! 

I was just too terrified to squeeze the trigger enough. I admit it. This build scares me. lol

Luckily i got a full face motorcycle helmet recently for free.

@longhairedboy I've found the "Soft RPM Limit" in VESC (in the PPM tab) to be a huge help when I'm testing. By default it's set without an effective limit, so bringing it down (I use 25K-30K) means full throttle won't be a scary speed. Then you can crank it higher once you've got everything resolved.

i havn't yet. i tried simply enabling it but that was a terrible idea. thy just went in all different directions and stuttered.  I'm not sure yet what values go where for FOC on these, i'm still digging around. 

if anyone has known good FOC settings for Enertion's 6355 190kv, post them here. I would like to export a known good XML file with FOC enabled and anything else setting wise that can sweetly tune these motors to buttery goodness.

@longhairedboy Slowly working on that, patiently waiting for onloops wood-cf deck and doing some layout mods to the vesc to directly use the motor sensor without changing the connector. All this bldc controller research i've been doing convince me that i need a eboard.

[Here] [1] is a post by okp on ES with the steps to setup the FOC parameters.
Tried it on the R-Spec @12S : failed. Back to BLDC mode.
I don't feel like mucking about in all these settings without knowing what I'm doing so either I start reading up on FOC or I wait till some friendly soul finally figures out how to do it and posts a decent step by step tutorial.
I don't even know if it's worth it. Less noise ? Don't care.
More efficient like in better range ? Do care.

I just ran the tests then applied the settings that the program discovered.  Once that was done my board was amazingly quiet and will now barely stutter at all when starting from a standstill.  Breaking is quiet too.

How long are the battery cables between capPCB pads and your battery? They should not be longer than 20cm for FOC, I had the same error (and some more) when the cables where to long. BLDC is less sensitive though.

I ran a battery from the front of my board to the back, and didn't have any problems. 

If you look at some of the DIY boosted boards on ES, they run their cables from front to back and I know I've seen a couple using VESC's.

@elkick my cables are certainly longer than 20cm so that may be the problem. 

Please excuse my scepticism but I would like to hear some objective opinions from real life experience why FOC would be better than BLDC on an e-skate.
At the moment it all seems like much ado about nothing, really.

Quoting Benjamin:
"Don't expect any magic from FOC. You will hear a big difference in sound, but you are not likely to gain any noticeable difference in efficiency. The FETs will most likely get warmer and the motor efficiency might increase a bit a low speed, which can be good for hub motors and ebikes. Also, the top speed (or motor kv) will get lower with FOC with a factor of sqrt(3) / 2 or 0.866 since the modulation is a bit limited when full sine waves are modulated. With a three shunt version of the VESC the modulation could be increased to 100%, but that means that the commutation at full speed will be trapezoidal, the same as bldc. Another way to increase the top speed is using field weakening, but I don't know how well that works and how efficient that is on our motors. The difference in sound is really worth FOC for me though :-)"
```

So basically the only real difference is less sound and hotter FET's.
I'm sticking with BLDC.

better sound isn't much of an improvement. They already sing my favorite song. 

So we now have three bullet points that are great on paper and mean ~nothing on the street:

 - regenerative braking
 - traction control
 - FOC

However, whatever they are doing is hella better than any other ESC i've ever used.

probably BLDC since there is a lack of documentation on properly setting up FOC with Enertion R-SPECS. @onloop is great about sharing his findings, so i suspect there are no findings yet from his camp, or they are still being gathered. 

And after test riding this build for the past two days i suspect there's no rush. Its already sooo good in BLDC mode.

## \#33 Posted by: treenutter Posted at: 2016-01-10T22:08:46.870Z Reads: 376

@longhairedboy @trbt555 I think that FOC might be a matter of preference in terms of what it means on-the-street. In early testing I'm experience much better low-speed control and smoother startups. Silent operation (if it doesn't come with a major performance hit) is a big benefit in my usage. I ride amongst other people and I definitely prefer the quiet operation. All just preference, but I think it's fair to call FOC legit a benefit of VESC, especially over other ESCs that can be neighborhood-waking loud at times. Now to see if I can actually perfect it in implementation :)

Am still deciding... I've got a few more days until the new remotes arrive and i have to ship the Raptors. So I will be testing to see if there's any benefits having the FOC for raptor...

if the start-up performance is better it is worth it... but the startup is already very good....

Agreed. ITs already quieter than the road noise on most pavement, and the startup is already good. 

I'm just not sure i want any more heat in my boxes. no fans, no sinks, and no ventilation means they need to operate cooler, but i definitely want to try it out.

I read a lot of threads trying to smooth out the acceleration from stand stills but they all end up talking about something else.

Are there any settings or tricks on the VESC we could set in order to accomplish butter smooth acceleration from a dead stop?

Maybe I'll give sensors a try but for now couid anyone suggest to try something?

super smooth, even in those shitty conditions. And there's nothing special going on in the VESC settings, just ran motor detection on my new sensored motors.

Im aware of that thread, in fact i just saw it again yesterday while derping around on here. 

My motor housings are basically identical  to R-SPECs and i've had no less than 50 of those motors come through my shop in one form or another, either doing raptor repairs on highly abused boards or using them in my own builds. I have a bin of about a dozen of them with various things wrong with them such as wire shorts, gashes in the motor can, wrecked bearings, or other mechanical failures resulting from heavy abuse or impact with objects. 

Not a single one has ever broken like that. I've never seen with my own eyes in person a motor break like that. Whatever happened with that motor was probably due to a factory defect affecting a short run of motors and/or seriously extreme circumstances that other people just aren't seeing. 

My personal suspicion on that one is that three of the screws broke loose just enough to cause undue stress on the single spoke containing the bolt hole in question in which the bolt was still tight enough to allow the spoke to stay put while the rest of the motor flexed, causing the cast aluminum to break off in a chunk on impact with some sort of immovable object. Religiously using thread locker on the motor mounting bolts would keep that from happening.

My source is Maytech. I emailed them directly and we had a conversation over email. I didn't go through a third party. 

If i ordered 1000 motors with zero modifications save the anodize color and laser etching, i could probably sell mine for $63 too. But i didn't, i only got 20 of them. And since they retail individually from maytech for $160 without keyways, superworm phase leads, VESC sensor adaptors, keys, or 5.5mm bullets, $130 is kind of a deal.

Hello,
      Not to bring this thread off topic but I have a question regarding your sensored motors @longhairedboy. I have the sensored 190kv motor from the electric-skateboard.market and I couldn't find a place to plug in the sensor wire that fit on my VESC, is there something I am missing here? 

P.S. The sensor wires/plug look exactly the same as yours except white.
