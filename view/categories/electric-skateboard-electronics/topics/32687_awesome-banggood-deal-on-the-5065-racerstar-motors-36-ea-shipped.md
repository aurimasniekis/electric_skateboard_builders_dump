I saw an add for these on facebook at $41 ea, and then noticed I had an email for some coupons as well for 10 percent off. I bought two, and if i didn't just get a tons of other parts I would buy like 10 of these for future builds but i'm trying to control myself :stuck_out_tongue: . This code should work for all other motors on their site too.

There was one more topic about them.. them seem to be quite good.. though hole / screw placement might be different from others motors.

Yes, I run a couple of 5065 200kv. They have been excellent so far.

compared to turnigy sk3s with same kv they have 2 to 3 times more W they can handle and double the amps, it seems to me that these are a lot weaker than turnigys

Quite possibly. 
I am 90/95 kilos and can hit close to 30mph where my trucks get a little funky. 
Dual motors 10s4p lion. I have no probs with the hills I encounter. 
If you're going single a 6374 motor would be better perhaps though.

Sounds like a good plan. 
You could also look at the slightly bigger turnigy if you wanted max power for your dollar.

I can't comment on the smaller motor. I had another build with a 6374 and it had plenty ooomph. Most people probably over spec their builds!

I am currently using two racestar 5045 motors, and I would purchase this motor again.  They are built solidly, the sensors work with a bit of tweaking and even the smaller 5045 motor has a ton of power (at least enough for your more average rider).  I give racestar the thumbs up.

Anyone knows how many poles these motors have? I'm trying to calculate the actual kv of my 200kv Racerstars
EDIT: found some useful info [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/more-40-55-motors-from-banggood-5045-200kv-5060-280kv-5065-200kv-6368-280kv/15433/95)

I used them in a build. They are good motors. Good turque and braking. I ran them in bldc and foc. In just regular bldc tool the braking isn’t that great in foc. I haven’t used them on a focbox yet. But tested fine on a maytech esc.
