Cool project. I would consider mounting those trucks in reverse, as an RKP truck should be mounted in the first place. Also, pls use the Esk8 News forum in the future üëå

Looks like quite a monster indeed.. though do u plan to run 2x of these batteries or just 1x acton pack? Otherwise, the battery pack might be a real bottle neck for such power dense setup.
