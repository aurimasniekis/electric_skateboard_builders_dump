Hey guys,

I have recently removed the first lipo cell from my 8S battery because it dropped to almost 0V. So far so good, everything works well, but when I check the voltages on my multimeter, the "new first" cell is always a good 0.1V lower than the other 6 cells in the pack. I am currently charging them with only 1A, because i've read it might help them to balance out again, but actually it seems to be getting further apart. What can I do to help the cells balance again? 

Cheers guys
