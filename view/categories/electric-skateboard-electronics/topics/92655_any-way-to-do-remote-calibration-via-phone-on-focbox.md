I have focboxes and Metr BT module, it has motor detection, sensor detection but no remote calibration. Any way to do that on the go via phone?

Oh ok, nice to know, I am using ackmaniac firmware and I don't think the mobile vesc tool supports that. Though I will have a check, thank you for that info.
