Hello! I want to reuse my Meepo mini 2 Standard  battery for a future DIY build. Is it possible  to take the current 2 stack of cells, and lay them flat to a 1stack of cells? I want to achieve a thinner electric board, without spending  money to buy more stuff.

10S2P packs typically use a square nickel strip. So, not easily, you'd pretty much have to dissemble the whole pack and rebuild it into a flat pack.

Remove the heat shrink and let’s see if it’s easy or difficult
