I have an Evolve Carbon Gen2 that after a couple of miles riding on a hot day it shut off, I restarted and sync'd with remote and it went 20 feet and shut down again. After trying this a few times & no change I searched the forums and it was suggested possibly a blown fuse. I took board apart and found a 30 amp fuse that did appear blown my question is looking at the photo of the circuit board does it look like there is damage to the solder and if so is this a easy fix?

That looks like crystalized flux to me (from hand soldering). Don't think your problem is there.
