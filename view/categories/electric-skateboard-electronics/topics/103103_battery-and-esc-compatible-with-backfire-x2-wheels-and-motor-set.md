I can’t find this info anywhere and need some help on my diy.  I have backfire ranger x2 rear wheel hub motor set, front and rear trucks, X2 front wheels, and a longboard.  Just need Help with a battery and esc and remote.  I don’t need to do 110mph.  I just want something reliable that I can cruise around on that will work with my set up.

I’m piecing it together.  I bought some items from Backfire and another guy on this forum.   Probably going to build a couple and see which one I like and sell off the other.  One will have the X2 components and one will have belt driven motors.  Still working on getting all of the components.
