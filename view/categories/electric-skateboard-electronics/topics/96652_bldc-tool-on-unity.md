Hey guys,

I don’t have a pc on me currently- I connected my unity to my board- paired it w the remote- and wheels don’t spin- I imagine the settings need to be tinkered with- can I fire up the bldc tool that I have and connect that to the unity? Any advice for iOS users? 

I’ll be damned if I have to go buy a new computer to complete this build!

Cheers

Wait are you talking about Ubuntu or another Linux distro running unity? Because there is a vesc tool for Linux.

Get someone with android, download the Focbox UI from the play store and update your firmware, perform motor detection, set your current limits and you are set. You don't need to buy a new pc, don't worry :smile:

Get second-hand android phones from friends and acquaintances.
