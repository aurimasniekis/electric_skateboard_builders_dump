Are you using a VESC? If so post some screenshots of your settings.

Generally this happens if the motor wires are shorting inside the motor. Sometimes related to when the motor wires are positioned in a way that results in movement when truck turns.

Open the motor and look for burn marks. put some insulation around any wires thato look burnt.

Try to secure the wires so they cannot be tugged or vibrated excessively.

Some type of strain relief for the wires is a good idea. A basic cable tie can work.
