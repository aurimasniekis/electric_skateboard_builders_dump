I have two unity's and one broke after 48 days, send enertion a mail for warranty and after 4 emails in two weeks still no response...the warranty is over now (around 70 days old now) but i send the email after 50 days (60 days warranty)....

Do anybody knows how to claim a new one and where to send it to for the warranty?

Thanks!

you'll be lucky to get a new one as enertion's customer support is basicly none existing. if you  can, request a charge back through your bank. if you can't do that, good luck

Get Paypal involved. Request support from your Bank/CC company.

Don't let Enertion play games with you.

Try sensorless motor detection, with sensors disconnected, also inspect for visible damage

I have a unity.  They are ignoring me.  Keep asking me to plug in to read faults.     Nothing detected when I plug it in.  

They ignored after that email.  I emailed 4 more times.     40 days old...   Lovely

Same with my situation i have a motor on my raptor 2 that makes grinding sounds and stutters until i manually spin the wheel. Enertion support stalled on getting to the core issue then stopped responding to emails once it was time to make good on the 2yr warranty. Thinking about putting them on blast on my YouTube channel lol
