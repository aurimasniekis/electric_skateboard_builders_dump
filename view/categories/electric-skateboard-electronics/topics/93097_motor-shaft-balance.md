Is there any practical consideration given by the motor manufacturers or us builders in shaft balancing?  

Flats are milled, keyways are machined and keys used on shafts.  Pulleys are notched for keys, single or dual threaded holes and hex screws are sometimes installed.

Just wondering from a vibration and/or longevity standpoint if anyone thinks it matters at all.

I don't think it matters because that's the last part that could fail. The most important are the magnets and how they are attached, then bearings, then sensors.

the centrifugal force and distance from the axis determines that any perceptible inbalance comes down to magnet density & a good motor company will balance the magnets like so

this is also why it is really important to keep the orientation and placement of any magnets that need re-glueing. They also need arrange the magnets for polarity reasons
