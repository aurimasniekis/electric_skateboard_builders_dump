* Yes. It works fine
* No! Nothing but trouble!
[/poll]

Just want to gauge input. I want this remote to work out so bad. I'm recharging and re-pairing it to give it one last chance. I just want to get some input before I take my enclosure back off.

It seems I am part of the lucky few that haven't gotten any problems with this remote. Had it for almost 3 weeks and used it about everyday.
In a few hours I will be testing the failsafe and range of the remote.

The problem with this remote, is when the receiver and the remote are not connect, the receiver sent 0, witch is the same as full brake, command to the ecs... And that is why, the board brake when you loose the connection between receiver and remote.

Once I set up the remote initially, it has worked with no major problems. Occasionally when I brake the trigger gets stuck on brake but that's not a major issue. I do charge it every day to be safe however.  4/5 stars from me

Once the failbrake is correctly set, I think it's a fine remote to use. I do still encounter the same issue as @Luke, sometimes my throttle gets stuck but that is when I accelerate so it can be dangerous but once you are aware of that you just have to push down the throttle instead of letting it go neutral by itself

I don't have any issue with mechanical trigger issues. That's fixable. I only care about signal issues. I think there's a group that got a bad batch of batteries. I may solder in an 800 mah battery

Just re-did the proper binding procedure and took the board out. It works great until the brakes cut out. Happened twice and I had to bail. Once the brakes cut there is no response and I have to restart the board.

This only happens if you dont rebind to reset neutral throttle. The opposite can happen too where it'll accelerate when you turn the remote off or it loses signal. But again, rebind fixes this.

Sorry, it was not LHB explanation, but Kaly as above.  I did have an issue prior to following the instructions as upon cut off of remote/battery, board would keep going at about 20% power.  Not good.  After recalibration to new "dead center," all is good.

Took the board out for a longer ride than before and had two drops that reconnected somewhat quickly. 

1.) I was accelerating, felt a jolt then slowed down, the "trigger/wheel" didn't respond forward nor backwards and I was just coasting for a second or two before it worked again.

2.) I was going at roughly 15 mph and holding the trigger. Decided to slow down by releasing the toggle and coasting, the board did not slow down when I let go, brakes didn't work, then it reconnected? and slowed down.

This thing seems to be possessed. I'm amazed that @onloop actually decided to ship this to me instead of the Steez that I ordered. I hope his Nano-X is more than a reshell because I like the thumb wheel control

Mine is working pretty well. When charging, the light is green, goes red when fully charged, which is the opposite of what the instructions said would happen. I thought I had some disconnection issues, but on inspection I think it was just bad connections elsewhere. initially I blamed the remote though.... perhaps that's our instinct, to blame the remote first?

Well given they wired up the lights the wrong way on mine, I definitely believe there are real issues too. It's a shame they can't sort out the quality, but I guess we're sort of still in a beggars can't be choosers kind of situation here. There's surely a few people working on quality versions of this kind of form-factor right now. I'll take 2!

Little update on the winning remote, it's Been randomly applying the brakes at full force when I begin to accelerate. This happens only sometimes. When the remote is fully charged this almost never happens. Within 30 minutes of use this happens frequently. I have re-binded the remote, and even used brand new servo wires and checked my parameters on the vesc, all seems normal, apart from the random braking. It's made me scared to go faster than a walking pace.

they work really well for me, they are also much harder to break when compared to the steeze who's buttons at the front are exposed.

**Check out these instructions before riding..**




Please test the fail-safe functionality (like moving the transmitter as far away from the board and checking if the motor shuts down if out of reach). If the motors doesnâ€™t shut down or applies brakes, please perform the following steps for binding and calibrating:

Check and make sure all the wires are connected and that the REMOTE is OFF. Insert the bind plug into CH3(Bind) on the RECEIVER.

With the REMOTE OFF: switch on the ESC to power up the RECEIVER, the red LED light will flash.

PRESS and HOLD the bind button on the REMOTE and then turn the REMOTE ON.

You should notice the REMOTE and RECEIVER LED light go from flashing red to solid red.

Once you see a solid red light, the binding process is complete. Then without turning the REMOTE OFF or touching the THROTTLE pull the bind plug out (for the receiver to record the throttle mid point, neutral, to engage the fail safe)

Then you can test it again by turning OFF the REMOTE and the RECEIVER LED should flash. By turning the REMOTE ON the RECEIVER LED should go back to solid red.

Before riding, it's better to test the fail safe functionality again. Leave the board powered on and switch the REMOTE off: if the motor isnâ€™t moving, the fail safe function is working, if the motor is moving fast or abruptly braking while throttle is applied: you have to repeat step No.1- No.6

About the sticking throttle/brake: this happens often, when the plastic part on top of the remote is pressed to far into the case. 

You can remove the 3 screws, turn the remote onto the other side, open it and remove the plastic part from the metal pin of the potentiometer. Now apply some glue to the pin, put back the plastic part, close the case again and pull the plastic thing out as far as it goes. Test, if it moves freely. If so, just let the glue dry over night.

At least that solved it with my winning remote, the problem was gone.

I think it's a quality control problem. Some worker/s at the factory is screwing up somewhere in China. There are those who have connection issues and some that don't. Like @Jinra said, it's 1% too many problems. I rode once with two disconnects, one was no throttle, the other was no brakes (much scarier). This weekend I rode 8 miles with zero issues. Same route too. That Nano-X better be more than a re-shell or it's a bust.

Since @onloop said it's been working well for him, I assume there's been no change to the electronics?

Maybe i shouldnÂ´t have read this topic before leaving for my afternoon ride.

Left my flat with both board and remote fully charged. After about 5 km, riding on a completely flat bikelane with about 20 km/h the board suddenly stopped and dropped me of. Luckily i reacted quickly and was able to run out but you all can imagine that the rest of the ride wasnÂ´t much fun because i had absolutely no explanation for this sudden stop and was afraid of the board stopping again.

Since i read a lot of these horror stories about the winning i donÂ´t want to say that iÂ´m done with it but i for sure have to look out for alternatives.

@onloop: Please double and triple check your new Nano-X batches if itÂ´s just a winning in an other shell.

FWIW, I've put hundreds of hours on my Yuneek E-GO (gen 1) and the remote works great. I charge it about once every 10 hours of riding, it's super small/slim, and has a big range of movement for accelerating and decelerating. It's the only esk8 remote I've ever used, but having read all these horror stories, maybe you guys with issues could consider getting one of these to work with your boards. 

It used to cut off when I first bought it but I realized it was getting interference from my phone in my pocket. I disable bluetooth on my phone when riding and since doing so it almost never loses connection. If it does lose connection, nothing scary happens; it neither accelerates nor decelerates, it coasts for about a second before the board 'beeps' letting me know it's reconnected. This maybe happens once every 10 hours of riding.

I don't mean physically stuck (though that's sometimes a problem too). The throttle will sometimes keep inputting a throttle command even when it's physically neutral, or not respond to brake commands.

I experienced the same problems as yours but I noticed it was always in the same spots, I've quickly come to the conclusion that the problem is radio signal interference. It happened near speed cameras and IP security cameras, I think that in Asia/Aus they may use another frequency/bandwith/channel but here in London, UK there were too many clashes. I went back to the other winning remote (same as tb remote), the [mini](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2-4Ghz-mini-remote-controller-with-receiver-for-electric-skateboard-longboard/32728989829.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_7,searchweb201602_3_10057_10056_10065_10068_10055_10054_10069_301_10059_10058_10073_10017_10071_10070_10060_10061_10052_10062_10053_10050_10051,searchweb201603_4&btsid=46c3df46-64b1-4aa2-9709-87018e6d992c) one, not the nano. Are the issues happening randomnly or always in the same spots? Does crouching keeping the remote near the board help (in my case it did, but it wasn't really a solution)?

up until last week I would have said: no issues with my Kaly Winning Remote. 

But ... then I lent a board to a friend so we could go for a ride together. 
He on my first build with the modded GT2B, me on my hummie hubs cruiser with the winning. 

Result: massive drop outs when we rode close to each other. No issues when we were like 50m apart. 
Don't get me wrong, he was not controlling my board. But when my winning remote was close to the GT2B I couldn't control my board anymore. 

At the same time, the GT2B had no issues. So please watch out with whom you're riding and what remote they have.

I had a suspicion that my random braking was to do with battery voltage, as they got more frequent after some riding. I tried fully charging the remote and leaving it plugged into the power bank for the entire run. I experienced no issues with random braking in the usual areas of riding/dropouts. I'll probably need to try it a bit more before I'm certain, but it was interesting
Edit:disregard this, it still randomly braked

I'm having similar issues myself. This "winning" remote seems to work great 8/10 times, by times I mean in any one stretch of road before needing to brake/turn etc. but pretty frequently I'm having connection errors or something. It cuts out when I accelerate and often comes right back a second later, others I need to restart it to get the connection back. My main issue is going low speeds and trying to accelerate smoothly with it cutting in and out, or holding a steady speed, because when it comes back it's often at full-throttle. Already had one spill due to this. Using a brand new Raptor so I'm confident all the internals are sound, I just think this remote/connection is not super dependable, which is critical if you want to feel secure/enjoy riding.

I could also probably use some settings adjusted in that BDCL tool thingy I keep hearing about.. Is it possible to make the acceleration linear to the thumb-stick? I seem to go from nothing to everything with very little in-between...

If you crouch and hold your remote by the board it saturates the signal and works correctly. So I took mine and moved it away from the electrical components and mounted it outside the enclosure. Problem solved. Just too bad I had to mount outside....

@Strawbs -  I have sent Jason/Enertion 3 emails since Friday evening regarding my new Raptor Duel, which is completely unrideable currently due to either this "Winning" remote or some VESC settings. I'm not 100% sure where the problem lays exactly. But what I can say is that at present when accelerating it cuts out basically every time and then returns at FULL power. Now had two tumbles due to this error (one badly damaging my Raptor's carbon fiber) and have decided not to use it again till fixed - It's a death-trap presently!! Trying to figure out this BLDC thingy now... anyone with experience I would seriously appreciate some help.. Here are my screen-shots I just took:

this should not be causing you any issues, but I'm pretty sure you only need PPM, no need for UART with the winning remote.
Can you show app configuration/ppm too? I doubt anything on there could be causing issues

I had to set my minimum pulsewidth to 1.10 and max to 2.18, that could just be me, but it's only difference i can tell. maybe try check read configuration in case
only do this to the master vesc-the one with the remote going into it
Go to app configuration/PPM
read configuration
show display
put remote onto full power
read what number it tells you (mine says 2.18 at full power)
enter whatever it tells you into max pulsewidth
write configuration
Your video i saw one some other thread made me think that your max pulsewidth is low

I've been an advocate for enertion, and bought their raptor.  It's a great freakin board when it works, way better than the commercial options.  But I just wish enertion would improve their customer service and responses.  They will fail as a business if they can't provide good service and prompt responses that help resolve issues, rather than ask to make videos to show what the issue is.

I had a bad experience with Enertion, but I still think they have what it takes to be a great company. It's not too late for them to turn it around. 

But this ridiculous. This customer contacted Enertion to address an issue that is potentially dangerous, and puts their customers at risk of serious injury. And their response is, "Can you get video of it?". Okayyy. Let me go risk my life so you have video of an issue that is widely known among the community. They are ultimately asking you to risk injury to prove a point. This is a law suit waiting to happen.

I completely agree.  If a customer emailed them that issue, they should resolve it immediately no questions asked.  No one is going to make up these issues for fun...

@onloop please train your staff to resolve issues immediately.  It's really going to effect your business, there seems to be more and more negative experiences being posted about enertion when I kept hearing from you that customer service will continue to improve and that was months ago.  I want Enertion to be a reputable and respected company.  But that won't happen if customer issues are not resolved swiftly.  No need to doubt your customers, if their boards are working fine you wouldn't hear from them.  They're emailing you because they really have an issue.  Showing video evidence for the issue above isn't easy.  I understand shipping all over the world is complicated, in which case you will have to send out whatever replacement parts needed asap or send it to your repair agents same day.

Morning bro, yeah I've had success! Enertion responded first thing Monday morning to the emails I sent over the weekend about this disconnecting remote issue. Jason immediately offered to send me a free replacement when their new remotes arrive in the coming days. Personally I'm very happy with their customer service! The video they requested was most probably so their techs have a better idea of the exact issue if they've never seen it first-hand (obviously I get this is less than ideal tho if potentially dangerous).

Every phone has a camera and Internet, so it is actually very easy and normally our customers have no issues with this request.

Asking for info is standard protocol (in nearly every industry) as it is best and fastest way to solve problems.

The other option is the customer can return a product but we prefer not to burden our customers with the hassle of shipping parts across the globe when some simple information is often good enough.

If we simply replaced every single product "no questions asked" that means every single enertion customer could email and get free parts sent out without ever providing any evidence of a fault.

This would be a very costly and inefficient way to provide our customers a service. We would never solve any issues, we would never gain any knowledge or insight of problems and as sad as it is to say, this approach would be easily taken advantage of by fraudsters.

No to mention we would have to increase our prices to cover the extra cost.

At enertion we strive to offer excellent warranty and service. We have 14 hour per day 7 day per week chat/support. Our vesc and raptor come with a 12 months instant replacement parts warranty and soon more products will have this same warranty level.

If other parts are faulty please emails us some proof and you will get your issue resolved in a timely manner.

bluetooth? or wifi? or both? Weird, why doesn't the steez or GT2B suffer this issue... 

All three (BT, WiFi, and these RC controllers) are on various sections of the 2.4 Ghz band. BT also uses FHSS and jumps around between 79 of the 1 mhz channels available there according to what I've read. So i guess maybe its a hog. 

I know that the GT2B and Steeze receivers pick up noise from WiFi as well as bluetooth because if the board's on and the remote isn't the motors twitch in their presence. Yet for some reason neither the Steeze nor the GT2Bs suffer this kind of interference. I've almost always got BT and WiFi radiating from my pocket while riding and have never had this issue. 

So if that's what's going on with the winnings, its lame electronics. And so much for bluetooth transceivers in the board with those remotes around.

They do. That's why i settled on wood and fiberglass instead of chasing down carbon composites or full carbon decks, and its also why the new raptors have black dyed  fiberglass lids. 

If i do a carbon composite deck it will not have any carbon between the receiver and the rider. I have some ideas in my head for a wood topped-bottom lidded carbon composite single piece deck-n-box but its a loooong way from prototyping still.

Bluetooth from my phone (maybe Wifi, too) definitely interferes with my Yuneek E-GO's bluetooth remote connection. 

I've heard of Boosted owners loosing signal in Manhattan where there are tons of other wireless signals. I don't think this issue of the remote loosing signal is unique to Enertion or Winning or whomever. 

I'm mostly concerned with how the board responds when signal is lost. Ideally, it just beeps to let you know signal is lost, the board coasts (or SLOWLY decelerates), and then it beeps again as soon as the connection reconnects. 

Obviously, not losing connection in the first place would be ideal, but if Boosted riders are having this issue - a company with tons of resources - then I think that's about as good as bluetooth remotes get at the moment?!

The main problem with esk8 remotes is jamming/interference, although Boosted Boards can no longer be taken over, the signal can be jammed and cause the rider to panic or whatever. In NYC there are a lot of wireless signals and many BB riders have had issues. The board can be programmed to react in a certain way when signal is lost, ideally, failsafe is set to turn the motors off, when it reconnects, it will be fine.

## \#81 Posted by: Alexander Posted at: 2016-09-20T08:17:10.650Z Reads: 237

Yes I agree completely, an industry standard fail-safe for all esk8s over a certain rating would be ideal. Some security/safety software that all VESC's or alike are outfitted with that prevents unpredictable motor behaviour at the moment of reconnection (if/when a rider's remote becomes disconnected), as this behaviour "could" become life-threatening under certain conditions.

Although as you say NOT becoming disconnected in the first place is really what we're shooting for. I know Boosted added a second bluetooth channel which seems highly logical, could we not design something similar using our radio connections?

My Winning is certainly interfered by my GT2B. 

I did a bench test on the weekend. Switched on board and winning remote, light push on the throttle (don't push it too hard on the bench!) and breaks work - no issues. No enclosures, the receiver is far away from any cables. 

When I then switch on my GT2B remote, the light on the winning receiver goes out and I loose connections. I don't even have to push the throttle or anything on the GT2B, just switching it on in the same room is enough to heavily interfere with the Winning.  
Connection comes back eventually, but throttle and break are very unreliable when the Gt2B is switched on. 
When I switch the GT2B back off, everything is fine again with the Winning. 

Vice versa there is no interference, the signal of the GT2B is not affected by switching on the Winning. 

The Winning is not so much winning any more for me ... going to "mad scientist" more GT2Bs.

@mrjonnyjones yo dude, check-out the comment above ^. Maybe your Mini remote (as similar to GT2B) was what caused that Sunday disconnect of my Winning remote after all, you were skating right next to me when I lost connection remember? So I've got the GT2B arriving tomorrow now (couldn't wait;) and the Mini arriving anytime 7 - 14 days from now as its coming from HK. Guess I'll test them both and see which functions better. If it's the GT2B I'll buy that mod kit..

I'm fairly convinced it's the remote itself and not the receiver. The receiver was changed out with a gt2b receiver and paired with the winning remote, and the problem still occurs. I'm guessing power issues with the remote, maybe needs some caps? Not sure.

possibly. I'm sticking with steezes for the forseeable future because its the most reliable one i've tried besides the GT2B signal wise and i can't use the GT2B because it vaguely resembles a gun. Basically anything with a trigger is off limits for now because of the way they're shaped. The only issue with the Steezes is the stupid little momentary switches on the front of the PCB that can snap off or blow the backs out on impact if the remote lands just right. I've fixed maybe three of these now and its a very, very simply fix. 

I've started experimenting with different ways to reinforce the buttons before i send them out now. I have a glob of hot glue in one, and resin in another, and i'm also trying to find a beefier switch with the same footprint that could be a drop in replacement.

To quote something @Ackmaniac said to me yesterday, if it's too powerful (using BLDC) "lower the Motor max to maybe 50 or 40. And if the overall power is too much then lower the Battery max to 20 or 15. Motor influences the acceleration especially at lower speeds and battery the top power."

I'm planning on greatly reducing these numbers just while I do the testing to be extra safe, then once the connection is working flawlessly I'll incrementally raise their values again. Glad this safety concept is catching on. If you have a Raptor Duel on order you're going to be blown away by its power. I seriously underestimated it. With the more torquey boards/builds it's definitely a smart idea I think. Safety first n all that :) So I kinda turned my nose up to the idea of safety equipment tbh but after just one day's riding my attitude has done a total 180. Get yourself some good pads n a helmet also - trust!

I'm having the same problems as well. It doesn't look to be as bad as everybody else, but occasional losses in signal are happening. It's a right pain in the arse, haven't even been able to test my boards top speed yet for fear of being thrown off. I've tried every trick on this forum to fix it but to no avail. 

If only the Maytech Steez would come out with a decent thumbstick design.

At this point, I'm just waiting for @onloop to finish up with the Nano X. Following that, my Winning remote will meet a swift end at the hands of the almighty Poseidon just as soon as I find a high enough cliff to throw it off.

Today my first test with the winning nano remote wasn't that good. I use a ferrit ring and mounted the receiver on the top of the board to be closer to the transmitter in a direct line. At first I did a range test: I only can go about 6 or 7 metres away and the signal get lost. This seems to be really week, isn't it? While driving I realized that when I put my shoe on the receiver the signal can break off as well.

What is your range with the Nano Remote? Do you think it's more a problem from the TX or the RX. Did anybody try the GT2B receiver, I red it should work. How is the range with it. Can I do anything if the problem is the transmitter.

How can they sell this stuff???

For what it's worth, I think why risk it? The GT2B has zero threads regarding drop outs or issues. And with @FLATLINEcustoms mad monkey enclosure you can have the reliability of the GT and the comfortable size of a much smaller remote. Just my two cents. Oh and I also have a winning remote for sale if anyone wants it? ðŸ˜‚ PM me...

I have a brand new GT2B and small case for sale [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/50-gt2b-remote-bad-wolf-mini-case-receiver/11031/7). I'll pay shipping. 

I have the Winning remote that shipped with my Dual Raptor. I fully charge the remote before every ride, hold it somewhat loosely with my hand, and put my phone in airplane mode.

The only thing I can compare the Winning to is the remote that came with my Yuneek E-GO. I haven't had many issues with either, they're about the same. They'll both cut out a LOT if my phone has bluetooth on and is near the remote, but my phone on airplane mode either one might cut off 1-2 times per 1hr of riding, and only for a second or two max. 

I don't like how the Winning/Raptor setup doesn't have a 'beep' letting you know when it's synced or lost connection - my E-GO makes a beep each time so you know and can act accordingly.

I didn't have interferences with my phone or wifi-towers or other things till now. But I have a range problem. As long I don't stay on the receiver and the nano remote is close to the RX I don't have dropouts. Yes the Remote is fully charged.
So please you Nano Remote Users make a range test for me. How far can you go away with the remote from the board till it dosn't work reliable? Thank you!!!

I'll do an outside range test later but inside, I run out of line-of-sight apartment before the range cuts out (10m+).

Maybe it's the luck of the draw whether or not you get a good one...

Okay so I tested the remote in the empty basement carpark of my building and measured about 25 meters before I started getting some unreliability. Perhaps I'd get more in an open field, but there aren't many of those around where I live!

Can't stress enough to make sure your fail safe is set correctly as even when it was getting to that unreliable range, it would just cut to coast when it dropped the signal.

After I just had a range of 6 or 7 metres I soldered coaxial antennas to the pcb antennas of the remote and the receiver. The shielding I didn't solder to anywhere. Don't know if it is all the same and the shielding works or not. In the original old TX and RX where I found the coaxial antennas the shielding was on minus. But in the winning TX and RX the pcb antennas are on minus so because of that I didn't solder the shielding. 
Howsoever I did a range test at first just with the antenna on the remote and I got almost 20 metres. Then I tried it also with an antenna on the receiver but the range was the same. But now I can put my shoe on the receiver and didn't have any problems on the test ride.

Today I tested the GT2R receiver. It was easy to bind it with the winning remote. It works on channel 3. The receiver has only fail save on channel 2 but the vesc has a timout function, so when the signal is lost the vesc goes to 50% = 0 throttle.

In my case:

Winning remote and Winning receiver = 7 metres range
Winning remote and receiver with extra antennas = 15 metres range
Winning remote with extra antenna and GT2R receiver = 23 metres range

I belive I set it up correctly because when I turn off the romote  the motor does not spin by itself. It used to that before but I fixed it. 

When I ride there is some sort of lag between the remote and the reciver. When I throttle,  the motor would not work for like a second and then when connection comes back it just gives instant boost to the motor and then I fall down lol. 

What I mean is that he the board starts "drag racing" 
Which is so fukin dangerous. I am kinda scared to ride at higher speeds

I mean you can see at the bar the throttle/brake range. When you turn off the remote the green bar should stay at 50%. With remote on the bar in trigger neutral also 50%. Full brake 0%, Full throttle 100%. If this is not correct you have to set the values of pulsewith in BLDC-Tool and failsafe (look in the manual of the remote).

For example: This is ackmaniacs version of BLDC Tool 2.52 so maybe yours looks different.

I was using this remote with the tb 6s esc and it was a nightmare. Constantly dropping signal causing the esc to hit the brakes for a split second, the throttle range is also so short that it is almost impossible to accelerate smoothly. This made riding the board terrifying and i found myself bracing to fall the whole time never going over speeds that i felt safe to jump off. I switched to the gt2b and it solved all my problems, all I can say is DONT USE THIS WITH THE TB 6S ESC

The graph is only at ackmaniacs BLDC-Tool. Probably you use version 2.18. If you want to have 0% at brake you have to adjust the pulswith. Did you try to turn off the remote after it was on? Is it 50% then?

Used the winning remote (from /TorqueBoards) for a few weeks with satisfaction, but the receiver stopped working. I'm pretty sure it's only the receiver, since also the little red light on the receiver suddenly went off, while the one on the remote still works. Did many people encounter this problem? 

I'm now searching for the cheapest way of getting a fully working remote controller again. Found the same winning remote on Aliexpress for just $37, but delivery was around a month, which I don't really like waiting on. Does anyone know a cheap and preferably fast way to replace the receiver? It needs to work with the Ch2 switch since I use that one to turn on my lightning through an Arduino. Read something about the Hobbyking 3Ch receiver as a replacement ([HobbyKingÂ® â„¢ GT-2 2.4Ghz Receiver 3Ch](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tm-gt-2-2-4ghz-receiver-3ch.html?___store=en_us)), but still looking for someone who can confirm this receiver is compatible with the winning remote and is able to turn on lights like the original receiver.

Anyone able to help me out? Also considered buying the [Enertion Nano-X 2.4Ghz Controller](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/nano-x-enertion-2-4ghz-controller/), but it's quite expensive combined with shipping costs and import costs and I don't know if its that much better than the normal 'winning' remote.

OK the fun was short lived . Today I busted my ass with this crap. It started cutting out after a couple seconds cruising and I had to let go the throttle and give it throttle again to get it to go. Now something is screwed if I give it throttle it goes for like 3 secs then cuts out , the signal is also really delayed if you command it to brake it won't do it for a couple seconds. 


Is there a better quality remote that's compatible with the hobby king receiver I bought ?

Seems like if I hold the remote 6" away from The receiver it will work right but I cut ride sitting down.


UPDATE: I bought this one http://www.ebay.com/itm/262779892776?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT

I've connected the remote with the esc / motor as described in the manual. 
When I pull down the throttle my motor begins to "beep". Second time pulling down the throttle the motor "beeps" again and starts to run. If the throttle is in the middle position the motor is running. For braking I have to pull down the throttle.
Why is that? I want the motor inly to run when pushing the throttle up. 
What am I doing wrong? 

These are the parts I am using:

I have just bought the winning remote from esk8.de and the transmitter and remote seem to bind, they both have a solid red light, but when i push forward nothing happens not even in the BLDC tool.
Do anybody know why this happens?

I havenâ€™t had issues with mine.

You have to go into the ppm tab and calibrate the remote

Sounds to me like you just need to calibrate the remote itself (if youâ€™ve not already) by turning that calibration screw:

Yes i have it set at ppm, i think you might be right about the throttle trim
```

So if you set ppm to none then display the throttle does it give you values? I think mine was 1.11 up to 2.1

Issue with the servo connection or binding then Iâ€™d say.

Cable in the right way and remote bound?

I have plugged the servo cable into channel 1 and have tried 3 different cables, so i have no idea why it wont work

V1 winning came with my Raptor 1 and worked fine for a few months then all of a sudden it started to randomly loose connection and was getting worse and worse untill coming to an intersection with no brakes i had to bail and messed up my knee lol.

I have 1 V2 remote and 3 Nano x (same remote difference case) never had a failure on these so far

Jumped off my board (skatebolt) at 22mph tonight. Not fun. It has the winning remote. At first it wasnt responding to acceleration, and then reconnected and took me at full throttle without slowing down. My instincts kicked in and told me to jump off, so I did and was able to run out a few steps until my knee locked up and I fell forward. Busted up knee and foot because of this. I need to get a new remote for this board. Also unsure how I would go about pairing a new remote.....

Get a [Mini Remote](http://www.esk8life.com/remote-controller) or [Benchwheel](https://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/handheld-electric-remote)

On my second flawless mini. First one was made inop by myself so no fault of the remote. Second is working flawlessly. No cutouts, no sticking, no problems.

then you need to get a new remote for that unit.  Any meepo/wowgo diy e should work.  It has a built in receiver and only pairs to the same handset.

So you are saying I need a new esc too because it will only pair with that specific remote?

That depends whether they will sell them seperately.  All you need is the handset.  Try the chinese sites like diyeboard or ownboard etc.

Ok. I could probably find it somewhere. The question is will I be able to pair a different remote  like the nano or bench wheel? Really dont want to use the winning remote again unless it's the only option

Keep in mind that this remote has a bug where you first need to power on the remote BEFORE the board is on, and give full throttle and break so this is calibrated correctly.

In my case if I would not do this step the braking curve get's all fucked up and brakes inconsistently with the remote (brakes strongly on the slightest touch), this could throw you off your board if you're not expecting or familiar with this. Not really recommendable, but you can get used to it and save some money on the remote.
