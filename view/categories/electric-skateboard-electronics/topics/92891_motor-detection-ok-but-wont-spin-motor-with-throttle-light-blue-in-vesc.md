Hello! I recently received 3 vesc repaired by @Martinsp, the detection of motors in BLDC is OK with all the vesc (the wheels spin perfectly), but when I try the input setup wizard the wheels do not move, I have tried with several remotes but the problem is the same. The light in all the vesc is constant blue, it does not change to green.
Attached 2 videos of the configuration with vesc tool.
