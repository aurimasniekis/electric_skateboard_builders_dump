Guys, this may be a silly question, but my sensor connector from my motor doesn't fit either of the connectors on my VESC. Am I missing something?

Yep. An adapter.
Search for hall sensor adapter in the forum and see if you find yours.  Or an alternative

I ended up buying some plugs with flyleads and soldering the new leads to the old ones and heat shrinking them.
Something like this.

Cheers mate, I'll grab this.

What about the wires though? I understand Gnd & 5v are at each end, but do we just miss out the temperature sensor wire and wire up the blue, white & yellow?

Just as an example.

I would buy some of these and make your own...

MOTOR SIDE  >>  JST-ZH 6 pin 1.5mm pitch
VESC SIDE   >>  JST-PH 6 pin 2.0mm pitch

Don't wanna take this off topic, but IMO the perfect low cost kid setup has to be the ego2 rear truck/motor(160kv) assembly, it's $30 and comes with everything minus wheels and gear for wheel. Indestructible covers on motor and belt. 90mm wheel set with gear installed is $40.

This is an inferior VESC from somewhere unknown, I bought it second hand from someone here on the forum, before I find out it was inferior (of course) and then had to buy another one!

I've already replaced a couple of caps, which one is c37 then?

I'm using this because it's quite underpowered, perfect for my son... Lol

You know where I could get one? Rs-components?

I'm surprised it works without it, is c51 on there? They're the same component. You can put 4.7/10/22uf 100V 2220 cap there. 22uf is best if you can get it or stack the others if that's all you can get. Also if you any dead vescs you can take it off c37/c51 on there

It was a while ago, I'd forgotten what reference it had.

Yeah c14 tends be left off cheap vescs, it's not required but helps. I may be mistaken but I think that was one the changes between 4.10 and 4.12, adding c14. 
It's between the red and black wire

OK, so definitely can't use the same caps as C44 & C49 for C14? The ones I have are 0805 though?? :confused:

I'm not aware of any 0805 on the vesc...
0805 is 1/8 watt 1206 is 1/4 watt..
Clearly it works if that's what you're using but it can't be healthy
You need 16V cap for c14

The red is always POSITIVE and the BLACK is always negative, don't mix those up.  The sensor wires can be in any configuration so straight through is best.
