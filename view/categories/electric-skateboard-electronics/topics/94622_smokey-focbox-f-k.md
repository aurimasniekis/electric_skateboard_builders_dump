Rage. 
Hoping someone can tell me what I did wrong. 
Or tell me it's fixable....

Sequence of events...

I just got finished running a motor detection on my 6374 and got the hall sensors working (another storey but it's fine) 

Turned everything off. Plugged the canbus cable back in, (other focbox was already configured, set as the slave and all G .... I had previously had everything running) 

Plugged in. Throttled up. Perfect. Motors in sync, no cogging (previously mentioned storey), lookin sexy as fuck.

Power up again, then gave it a bit of brake. And then smoke..... (From the master)

Other deets
- All the other focbox settings were default I didn't mess with anything 99% sure on that.
- 12s5p 30q battery. Charged to about 46v. 
- the slave focbox still worked / other motor spun. (While still connected to the master even though it wasn't working) 
- off an on again - nothin. Just sits there with the blue light. 


Anyone know what's fried looking at these pics? 
I'd never opened it up so I can't spot the difference..... (Also not that electronically savvy)

Needless to say ... I'm pretty bummed. Been putting this together for about 10 months and it's my first build. ðŸ˜¢

Thats what I was thinking but, when my esc went up in smoke it was also the capictors so just want to check.

Taking it back out of its case.... It does 'smell' like the problem is on the underside. Hilarious as it sounds it was noticeable after taking the underside cover off again ha.

@dareno I'm pretty sure I was reading your thread not long ago about you frying something :open_mouth:

I hope I haven't just done the exact thing you have after reading the thread

There is no where and I mean no where you can get esk8 related esc's repaired here.  I have tried.  Can bus well then you can snip off the chips but DRV's well no.   If you find an Aussie wizard then share.

The irony in that Australia, the home of the Focbox, has nobody to repair them is not lost on me :grinning:

Bought these late November last year.... What are the chances I'll get it replaced you think? Seeing as they have never been 'used' 

(I didn't buy the replacement warranty... Welp)

50dollar is not the deal breaker on a whole board.

I suppose because its an Australian company, it should be obliged to comply with Australian consumer law?

The question is are you buying from an Australian company?

Maybe this is one of the reasons they have no local shipping.

I think a major factor is voltage. They're only capable of handling 60v, and occasionally (obv depending on setup) spikes above that occur

Any Laptop/phone repair buisness that is worthy to be called **repair buisness** should be capable to replace a DRV8302 for small money. At least if you provide the part and state that you cover the labor and risk (that the repair fails if more than the DRV is done). 

It's a 5-15$ chip and maybe 20 min of work + flux, a hot air station and maybe a 
magnifying glass/
microscope thats it.
