Hey all
Second VESC here. TorqueBoards one. First one I shorted a motor wire and blew, replaced. Got it yesterday and installed it today and was doing about 15 miles of riding. Next thing I know....

I am using a 12s4p, and their 6374. Motor limit was 80, -80 watts. ERPM limit was 60,000 and -60,000, and battery limit was 70 and -12.

So I have two questions. What the heck coulda caused this to blow? I was literally riding it and it stopped. Not pushing it hard. Also, anyone know any VESC repair services on here?

DRV blown - are you running FOC on 2.18 firmware?

@Martinsp repairs 4.12 HW

You run single VESC right?
70A bat max definitely too much.
Not sure whatÂ´s the limit for 4.12, but should be around 40-50A max with heat sink.
I know your battery maybe can supply that, but your VESC as you can see canÂ´t handle it.
Do you have some logfiles from your ride?

```
UNITY can
So can a single one if properly cooled
And motor amps aren't necessary the same as battery amps

Unity is a other topic...and a unity for single setup ðŸ¤”...ok 
I think only @Kug3lis got that focbox to such a high current with his special heat sink case.
But thatâ€™s also a bit a tuning of the focbox ðŸ˜‰
The standard focbox will not last long with that settings.

Dont do 12S on 4.12 HW...Switch to 10S and make sure you have 4.2uF on C18.

I have a hot air rework station. Kinda wanna attempt to replace the DRV again. Last time I didnâ€™t have solder paste and messed up a pin on the PCB when I tried to remove. If I canâ€™t find a service for 40 ish bucks in the US I will try it. 

Also, I didnâ€™t know the VESC couldnâ€™t handle those values. Should I reduce them or heat sink the mosfets and DRV?

PM @JohnnyMeduse, he can fix the the VESC for you.  FYI, anything over 50/-50 on the TB VESC is dangerous.   With a focbox you can go to 60/-60 with no problems, in fact i've run 70-70 before.

No........
I run batt max 50a
Motor max 80a
On 10s
On 12s you should start with @mmaner suggested motor max and go from there checking your motor temp. 
Running motor max too high can cause the motor to overheat

```
The vesc converts your amps and voltage coming in to what is going out.
That means that the motor current can be higher than the battery current but the voltage on the motor will drop in this case.
So U*I input is U*I Output but the values of U and I is changed by the vesc according to your response on the throttle.

I've run 40 each on TB vescs and have blown 2

I've read that they're just problematic

I just ordered focboxes myself

Won't matter. The letters only affect the way the DRV is packaged (eg: comes in plastic reel or, paper reel).

I replaced the DRV with one I had lying around. The DRV was new but it had previously been attempted to be soldered on another VESC. The DRV does not show any signs of failure though. After I replaced it, I powered it on. Found I had a short on one of the DRV pins and fixed it. Powered on again and found that the D5 diode was hot. I replaced it and the board turned on for about 2 seconds before going dark again. I have a short between the D5 diode I think, the 5v and GND on the servo connector have continuity. I have another diode to try, but that doesn't help me if it is going to short again somehow. I believe D5 and D4 are both fried somehow since I am getting .12 volts either way I test them. UPDATE:
Turned on the VESC even though it was getting hot. D5 got so hot it unsoldered itself, but after it did, the board came on and I am connected in the VESC tool. What does D5 do, and can I run it without? And what could cause D5 to short?

[/quote]

D5 clamps any overvoltage on the 5V rail before it destroys the microcontroller/CPU.  The DRV8302 provides the 5V.  It can run without it, but it's a safety device which should probably be replaced.  The servo receiver also uses the 5V supply rail for power.

Maybe the diode I pulled off another VESC was broken, but when I replaced it, it did the same thing the other one did. NO power and and gets hot. I pulled it back off and it was working. Could there something else that could cause a good diode to go bad in that case? Or did I have a bad diode.

Using a multimeter, check the voltage on the pads when the diode is removed, or the voltage on the servo power and ground pins

Does anybody know what the reason for this could be? I have ran the same setup for 2 years. I installed a new button on my anti spark switch and after a couple of rides, this happened.

Not sure what happened. Had the system on and tried to spin the motor up and it blew up the mosfet switch and the motor didnâ€™t spin. If I use a lab power supply, is there a way to see if the VESC is sending power through the phase wires?

Yea I messed the VESC up. Suspected reason: I had polarity wrong. No resistance between positive and negative Vin on the VESC now. Anywhere from 0.0 to .01 ohms. How fun.

If it was operator error and not equipment failure, you should consider removing the "TB" from the title :slight_smile:

Yes originally I suspected equipment failure, but the original failure of the VESC was supposedly from having the battery amps too high. Title changed. 
Anyways, is it possible to fix a VESC damaged by reverse polarity?
