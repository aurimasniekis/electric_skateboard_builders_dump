Just curious as to how big of a battery some of you are using? I'm building a pack right now which is a 12s 16000 mah, which is massive 710 Wh. Never heard of anyone using a battery this large,

So whats the biggest anyone's used before?

probably biggest i know about being used is probably @chaka's.  6-700 Wh iirc.

I'm a fan of smaller lighter setups - ideally swappable if i want to go further distance.  A spare battery in my bag or pocket is easier to carry than more weight under my board IMO.  Different strokes for different folks!

I use a 10s8p on my mountain board. 720 WH

What about the guy who build a 13p battery out of laptop cells? 

Never saw a picture though

How is your pack 806? if youre using liion your nominal is 3.6 volts/cell. so 3.6 * 12= 43.2   and 43.2 * 16= 691.

and lipo is still only 710.   From what i know i have the biggest pack lol   even the 13P pack is smaller due to old cells.  I remember calculating it.

ok, maybe I did it wrong. I did the calculation at 4.2 volts per cell, since that's a full charge.

You do the calculation at the lowest voltage per cell?

 you do it at nominal so 3.6 for liion and 3.7 for lipo.  3.2 for lifepo

ok, I'll edit that than, thanks for the heads up. It's a lipo 12s2p. multistar pack, aka, the weaksauce filled packs, but they won't be weak at this size.

Yea if you run them at 2p then theyre fine.  ive done a 10s2p with multistar before and it was totally fine :)

Do you know how many amps you've pulled from them at once? I might be building an over kill, but I'm build a 4wd with these and I want to pull 100 amps (25 per vesc/motor). They advertise 10c discharge, but on ES, some guys said 4c or 5c was really their limit.

How many miles do you get with that massive pack?
```

oh man you shouldnt be using multistar for a 4wd board...  mine was find with 2p on a single drive.  your acceleration is gonna tank! I don't know the amp pull sorry!

and its on a dual rear chain drive on 8 in pneumatics I havent measured range yet! but i think itll get me like 30 miles.  on a single drive street board it would get around 55miles

```
Why do you think the acceleration will tank? It's a question of how many amps I can draw.  If I pull 100 amps to one motor or across 4, whats the difference? It's just spreading the work out across the four motors instead of one or two doing it all.
```

```
2 motors pulls about 30% more amps than 1 motor with the same load. 

I'm not sure how that math works out with 3 or 4 wheels but I'm sure it just pulls more amps. 

There is less amp pull PER esc 
But more amp pull from the battery since all the esc's share the same battery
The question is-can that battery give you 100amps.  I don't think it can

If there are 10c discharge at 16ah, that's 160 amp discharge. If I pull 100 amps, that's like 6-7c. I guess only time will tell

But they are actually 4-5C in reality. If you can afford 4 wheel setup, don't save at the wrong place.

Wouldn't the total amps pulled be similar on 2wd vs. 4wd? That same 50 amps would just be split 4 ways instead of 2, right? You're still moving the same load. I'm also going to try a 4wd hub board, and I'm planning on running off a 12s 5200mah multistar, so I hope you should be ok, cause I hope I'm gonna be ok. Lol
I'll hook up my watt meter when I do it and see what's really going on.

It's not about money. It's about space. They have the highest density of mAh for the size. If it doesn't work out, I will use another battery. The next best option I could find was half the mAh and only slightly smaller, but a 20c rating.

What would happen if I try drawing more than they can sustained? Will the blow up and catch fire? Or just die early?

If you draw more amps than it candle handle, you already listed your options:
-blow up
-catch fire
-die early
combinations of these effects also are possible

So if accept take them to be 5c, I'm still at 80 amps, or 20 per motor. Right now, I'm running 10s and max amps to 50 total in a dual drive, and only issue I have is heat in motor. With 80 amps at 12s, I assume I should have much more power than 50 amps at 10s, which is hill climbing and acceleration wise fine with me.

It's possible this will work.

I previously use a 12S 15Ah 30C Lipo on my eMTB.  On this post http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/emtb-and-vanguard-built/995?u=kaly

In my experience a 10C Lipo will work but the performance for your application will be average at least you'll be better serve if you go with a higher C rating if you want to get the best of that 4wd setup.

What about someone using these 5500 shockli cells or 4200mah ijoy cells to make a crazy long ride? If the 5500 work and someone made a single drive emtb you could make 12s8p with 88000mah hahah!

No, your math is wrong
In a 12s 8p it would be; 5500mAh* 8= 44000mAh 43.2v* 44Ah= 1900.8wh

With my 5AH Makitas i have 720WH now. 8X18VX5Ah
After finishing my 8X 18V 7,5 Packs it will be 1,1kWh

And to be honest i could really use that. with the altitude i have here in the Austrian Alps a big Battery is not a fault at all for a Daytrip.
