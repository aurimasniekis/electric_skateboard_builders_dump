EDIT: nvmnd just ended up splitting a power line and splicing then together. 

@stewii 

I’m hooking up my voltmeter, I can see where the ground goes, which I already connected, but is there a place I can solder the red (power) wire on? I see there is red wires on the backside of the esc but I can’t flip the esc over because it’s glued into the enclosure.
