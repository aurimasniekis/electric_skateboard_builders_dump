Found this video with super cheap chinese links to a 6S esc and batteries ect.

11.1V 3S 5200mah 25c Lipo Battery:

Tacons for X2 @$70

List for cheap chinese eSK8:
Tacons: $140
ESC X2 : ~$80
Two TQ mounting/ belt kits: $260
TX/RX: $20
Batteries and charger: $60-80
Deck with trucks: $100
Miscellaneous connectors 
velcro box for mounting shipping ect: $100
TOTAL: <$800 

I also realize you could've made a awesome dual hub board with @Hummie motors and used 12S and dual vescs but this is budget. for the heck of it

List for @Hummie dual hub motor on a budget when a set was $200
Vesc:$200
@Hummie   Motors:$200
Deck and trucks:$100
Batteries and charger: $100-200 
TX/RX; $50 
Extra stuff and shipping: $100

Total: <$800

Just some ideas for cheap stuff as I have a WIP single belt system.

Edit: @Hummie motors are $400 instead of $200 so you can still make a cool board dual rear under $1000
