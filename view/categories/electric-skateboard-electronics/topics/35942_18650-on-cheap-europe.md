I live in Poland and waiting for parts sended from China/Australia/Usa is killing me. So I want to order 30 pcs of 18650 batteries locally to build my 10sp3 battery pack for my electric longboard build (enertion raptor 6355, enertion vesc, 83mm wheels, custom build deck, caliber 2 trucks, no gearing choose yet).

Options that i consider (taking price into account) are: (from most expensive to cheapest)

1) Samsung INR18650-35E 3500 mAh
2) Panasonic NCR18650B 3400 mAh
3) SANYO NCR 18650 GA 3500 mAh  
4) SONY US18650VTC5 2600 mAh
5) LG INR18650 MH1 3200 mAh

(in perspective: one Samsung 30Q cost as much as almost three VTC5)

Are those any good? Im planning to buy VTC5, but first i would like to know Your opinion. At first i wanted to use old laptop cell, but i had bad luck and find only couple cells worth using and over 50 dead ones.

You can get 30q's for 3,39€ / piece if you buy 40 or more. That's a good price imo
