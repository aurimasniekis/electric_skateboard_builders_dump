Don't screw it up for the rest of us, insulate your P's and fuse your positive terminals on your cells!

One fire is too many. Maybe if most of us were riding down desolate highways it would not matter but when we see a board go up in smoke in the town square it makes me worry. I worry that overly strict regulations will form or worse...

If you do not want to go through the trouble of fusing a pack at the very least you should be isolating the paralleled cells from the next group of cells with a strip of fishpaper and insulate the edge of the positive terminal if you are bridging cells with nickle strip.

Edit: Over the course of the next few days/weeks I will be adding photos and tips for cell level fusing. Handling bare cells is extremely dangerous and I do not recommend using any of my techniques. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!

Step 1.

Build a gluing fixture. It can be two block of anything, in the photo I am using some scrap aluminum blocks but wood or other non conductive material is better. I am holding the blocks down with a few spring clamps. You also need a straight edge to align all the cells before running beads of silicon to hold the cells together.  Use "natural cure silicon", I use Dow Corning 737. It is non acidic and will not harm electronics are cause corrosion like the common acid based silicon. There is a reason that stuff smells like vinegar.

When applying the silicon between the cells be sure to push the caulking gun not pull. This forces the silicon into the gap and leaves a nice concave behind, no need to smooth it out with your finger. Trust me it works. much easier to do it without holding a camera too! After a few hours, to allow the silicon to cure, you can flip the group of cells and repeat the processes on the other side.

``
Step 2.

Cut insulation strips using the adhesive backed fishpaper and apply them to your cells. Pre-fold the strip that goes on the positive side to protect the negative ring that surrounds the positive terminal. Make sure the strips are long enough to wrap around the end of the cell group, more on this later.

Prepare your tabs. They need to be flat, cutting can curl the edges. Pressing them between to flat surfaces flattens them nicely.

Step 3.

Spot weld your cells gradually. Do not hit one cell with 8 spot welds all at once our you will heat it up more than if you had used a soldering iron. Do it in several passes. Also notice that we to not fold the insulation over the edge of the negative terminals.

First pass.

Final pass.

Now we weld a bussbar to the tabs. Be sure to provide enough of a gap to allow the strips to bend around the edge of the cells.

We weld thinner gauge strips to the positive terminals and fold them over. These provide strain relief and allow us to solder our fuse wires without heating the cells.

Nice concept, i will do it on the next build. You know the positive terminal inside the cell has a diaphram that deactives the cell if it overheats or gets shorted before a fire breaks out.

@Rinzier correct me if I'm wrong, but they don't describe the technique, they only describe the implications and benefits.  I don't see a schematic anywhere on how to actually do it...

## \#7 Posted by: Rinzler Posted at: 2017-10-07T18:21:38.835Z Reads: 839

```
Yes, but the cell gets very hot and vents flammable gasses which catches fire. The diaphram exists but it can only protect you when one cell has a runaway, and it is alone. Look at a tesla car battery, there are a bunch of cells with the diaphram, yet they built a cell level fusing on every cell because the diaphram isnt enough.

I use cell level fusing to make a connection to a bussbar that is in series with the next group of paralleled cells. It is also important to insulate each group of paralleled cells from the  neighboring groups.

Hah! I still got fuse on my cell however last month it seem 2 of the fuses came loose and 6 cells ended up dropping to 2.5 volts! I was running 10s but now back to 8s.

I think I just did a bad job soldering a couple fuse. I redid a lot of them now though so I don't think I will have this problem again however I installed a lipo beeper so now it will beep whenever a cell drops below 3 volts! Can believe I didn't think of it before but I'm is a must have for anyone running bmsless. However you will need 2 if you go higher than 8s still super easy to install though!

I do it differently than chaka since I soldered straight to cell, but basically you have a buss bar (brass for me) that lays on the side of the cells. The fuse gets soldered onto the buss bar connecting to the cell creating a parallel connection. If a cell outputs too much current, it'll blow the fuse disconnecting it from the rest of the parallel group.

I don't believe heat was the main cause because the wire was breaking right where it connected to the solder blobs (at cell and at brass). Those spots seem to me like weak points where vibrations could fracture to the metal.

I don't know if this means anything but I have a 40 amp blade fuse before the battery's xt60. So I don't draw much current for my battery. 

Heat would definitely contribute though. So maybe I should try 20 awg like you suggested.

I used 22awg wire and it's been holding up surprisingly well. I've pulled maybe 3200 watts max and driven plenty of back alleys. I made sure my cells and buss bar were well secured to each other. Maybe I just got lucky. Doubling up will be a nightmare to solder as there is already hundreds of solder joints might consider going even bigger than 20awg if you already defeating purpose of "fuse" wire. Wonder what guage @chaka using for fuse wire

So if I were to use two fuse wires, would I have two separate wires coming from the cell to the buss bar or would i double up the wires. I've added a diagram below because I don't really know how to explain:

If I read that chart correctly for 10s4p average would be 18 awg and for 10s5p 16 awg atleast thats what I read.if we are using the max amps of 60a on the vesc. But I doubt we can get all that from the vesc

I usually refer to this chart when I need a nickel plated fuse. Keep in mind that "fusing current" is referred to very short cuts of a wire (1cm). 
You have to look at "current rating" if you plan to use the wire over bigger distance (1m).

22 awg works well in a 60 cell pack. If you go to a lower cell count you might need to use thicker wire since each cell will need to discharge more rapidly in a small pack but I worry that it will be too big to blow if you use thicker wire.

@jinra I think you needed some strain relief. I get the needed strain relief from the folded tabs that the fuse wires are soldered onto. Never had an issue, and I have been doing this type of construction for a several years.

Doesn't it go well because 6p relieves a lot of strain being put onto each individual cell? pulling 80a on a 4p pack would put 20a current through each cell while pulling 80a on a 6p pack would pull only 13a~.

A good rule of thumb is factor in 13% headroom over your max when fusing. 22awg is right in that range for a 20 amp cell. However, if we are pulling 20 amps constant from an 18650 on a regular basis we are killing the cells. Just because we can doesn't mean we should, discharging around 2c max/constant is what I try and shoot for. 1c would be better but would require 120 cells!

Also, the entire can of the 18650 besides the small anode is the cathode. So if the wrap were to break and short, fuses on the cathode would not be able to do its job. Therefore, my thinking would be to eliminate as many factors as possible and fuse the anode.

so on a 5P it sounds like the 20awg fuse wire is the way to go. regarding vibrational damage mitigation, @chaka are you recommending a sort of fuse tab, like a balance lead tab in fashion.. for soldering the fuse wire to the cell or the bus bar? And what's the exact length requirement there? it seems like there may be a way to put slack in the fuse itself to allow a minor amount of movement, but at the same time, a hot wire jiggling around may also lead to breakage. 

mad solder skills doing it quick enough to not keep the cells hot too long. That's part of the reason i weld, the heat is consistent and i can mitigate it easily with just pacing and pattern. If the first attempt of a solder doesn't take it has to be reflowed. Of course a bad weld has to be rewelded as well.

Yes a tab on the positive end folded onto itself after making the welds. I then add another layer of fishpaper over the buss bars and fused tabs for insulation and to provide a small air gap before heat shrinking. I also make my series connections with a small section of 12awg silicon cable for strain relief.  This allows the pack to conform to a boards curves without inducing stress on the connections.

[/quote]

that is EXACTLY how i do the evolve packs. 12AWG jumpers between the twin P groups.

Since i use a trapezoidal stack pattern to cram more cells in less space in my own boards, i'm in the process of drawing up a nickel plate that would be laminated to fishpaper. The outside shape would have the same shape as the P group stack, with holes cut out where the cell ends go. The holes would be about the size of the area you would normally weld. Then i want to jump fuse wire from the plate to the cell through that hole. if i can also ice the cake with a sticky backing on the fish paper, it will drastically reduce pack construction time while increasing the safety factor. 

So this would be a really short run and would likely require a thinner fuse wire, so i may need that chart posted earlier and a few iterations to get it right, but this is the direction we're heading.

I think in our case durability is equal to having insulation. This video surprised me that arcing can occur at DC 80V 6A. The arc occurs when he pulls the wires apart, so drawn arcs don't require very high voltages. 

I have a feeling this could happen in our packs, but the cell fuses should help.

I see two main connections :

- fuse (thin wire) to the large strip - nickel or copper plated  (classical weld ?)

Where is the spot welding ? Is it that you spot weld the negative pole of the cells directly to a nickel strip without fuse ?

Have you tried extending the strips on the positive terminal so they bend up and just over to the top of the cells like on the negative side and then welding a thinner strip between the positive strips and the bus bar on the top of the packs to act as the fuses? 

Means you'd be able to completely avoid soldering and would also mean you're not bending the fuses (ie the weak points) over the edge of the cells? I think the biggest issue I had when I soldered fuse wires between the bus bar and the positive terminals is that heavy vibrations would sometimes cause the bend point in the fuse wires to break

While that might help, it doesn't really solve the issue of the the fuse wire being more of an unnecessary mechanical weak point than it needs to be and the idea would also be to try and completely remove the need for soldering fuse wires. 

Fuse wires also end up sticking out from the rest of the side of the pack just slightly because they're thicker than nickel strips which means that you need to take this into account when shrink wrapping the pack etc as the fuse wires will end up digging outwards slightly and become the first point of contact with external objects in the case that your battery isn't 100% secure etc.

I have well over 4000 miles on this type of battery pack and it is still holding up. Most builders go wrong by not stabilizing everything inside their enclosure with a dampening material like natural cure silicone. My guess would be that you had excessive movement or you did not fix the buss bar from moving. Batteries should always be 100% secure. Any movement at all will eventually wear through the battery casing over time due to vibration.

 I lay down strips of foam rubber and lay beads of silicone to fasten the pack inside my decks. A second set of strips go on top of my packs to allow for a compression fit once the hatch is on. 

@trigger4point7 the batteries are like little flares when they go thermal, the whole point of this is to stop that from being a possibility or at the very least limit the extent of the damage if the board is compromised by an accident. If you are worried about the adhesive flaring up just be sure to buy from a reputable distributor and stay away from Alibaba for your insulators.

A fuckload of flex. I could pot an entire sled in silicone and if i arancged things correctly i could mount it on a loaded deck and bounce around all day. 

the problem is that silicone is soft so a damage and puncture resistant shell is still needed, but no reason it couldn't be scaled like armor to allow flex. 

shit that sounds like an idea there. If you properly footed the silicone into the deck you probably wouldn't even need fasteners of any kind, just clever ridges and etchings to give it some grab.

Yeah that whole thing seemed sketch to me. i'd rather use a thin gauge superworm because i've seen what happens when those smaller wires, 22 guage and below, do when they wick up inside that silicone sheathing during a hard short on an 18650 pack. It's awesome to watch. You can see the light from the melting copper travel up through the center of the silicone tube and then nothing. MEanwhile, the insulation is 100% in tact and the wire looks as if nothing has happened to it at all. The fire was completely contained, so to speak. Burned up copper safely inside the silicone sheathing. 

what gauge do you think would be appropriate if we tried that as a fusing technique?

Yea I've gone with a new design for my new board where I've used your original cell level fuse design as inspiration. My packs are two cells thick so I run the bus bars on the side. 

One of the things that's made designing my packs more difficult is that I wanted them to be able to be easily removable from the enclosures and split up into sub 99Wh packs which makes securing them more difficult. 

Atm I have the batteries wrapped in kapton tape, then a thin layer of felt for vibration dampening and then shrink wrapped and stuck to my enclosure with velcro. They didn't come out as cleanly as I'd liked, but so far they're holding up really well but I guess we'll see how things go.

i glue my cells, use electrical tape to bind the wires down and prevent balance leads from rubbing against nickel, and then heat shrink the whole thing. I don't use kapton. just in case anyone was wondering. 

I'm still looking to have custom nickel or copper stamped though. I may even try to machine out a few myself once i get Shirley leveled again and rig up a jig with an engraver bit. 

I want to do cell level fusing not only for the safety of potentially preventing thermal runaway and over current discharge, but also because if done right the process can can take a lot less time than welding.

I am currently working on a PCB for my next build that will have SMD fuses for each cell and also a passive temperature sensing which means that while the cell is not over heated the temperature "measuring" does not require any input power yet still is active.
**Are you guys interested in such a thing? Like this if you are so i can gauge the interest. :)** 

Here is a thread with a simpler design, which I have already improved and I am waiting for a quote from a factory. That will be up this week hopefully.

The temperature will be probably set to 70°C which is 10°C above the safe temperature. At that point it is about having the board explode/burst into flames (or other catastrophic scenarios) or to stop the temperature from rising.

Plus the temperature difference of inside the cell and the case + plastic wraping will be like 10-20ºC off

If you reach that temp even cutting power will not help you it will be prompt to catch fire by self igniting.

In a scenario where the cells are actually getting to such temperatures the difference between the temperature sensor and the inside of the cell or its metal body might be different but there would be a small time difference/delay between the cell reaching say 60°C and the sensor reaching this temperature, the delay may be a couple of seconds because of the minimal distance between cell and sensor.

I did not mean that this is supposed to prevent your board from being damaged (not in first place at least) but to prevent your board from destroying more things or hurting the user. Say you have your board charging in your garage and the cell is slowly climbing in temperature, when it reaches the temperature threshold of the sensor it will get disconnected and stop charging therefore stop heating up more since the power source is cut.
Another scenario would be (in most cases) when you are climbing steep hills and your battery is providing high current to the system, in such a scenario you dont need to worry about brakes.

If your battery is on fire as you said you wont be able to stop because the battery would not work. Inside the battery is a plastic-like electrolyte in form of a film that separates the two other "films" being the opposite potentials. In this case when the film melts it shorts the battery which would mean that the battery is useless which results in the same thing, your board would turn off plus the fire. This is what I am trying to avoid.

When the battery catches on fire/gets pierced etc. it becomes a 0 ohm resistor since the two terminals become shorted on the inside.

The temperature (70°C) is a temperature where the battery can still operate but it is getting to the dangerous state. I had a look at a 30Q specification and that is the temperature to which a 30Q gets after 20A discharge which is 5A over limit.

You should try it. It's pretty easy. You can buy A4 size, 2mm thick copper sheets from hobby stores. They use them to scratch build model trains or WW2 scenery. It's cheap and you can cut it to any size buss bar you want. Here in Australia, old houses still use fuse wire in the electrical mains box. So rated fuse wire is readily available. 

Haven't had any issues with my battery set up so far.

How much of an issue would it be if the p-groups are laid out long ways. Would that mean anything at all or would it be fine and dandy? 
I am thinking that it might be an issue with the closeness between the two groups potential still making the fused cell in series with the next group. Especially with the hauge strips welded to the positive terminal. 
I guess you could just make sure to isolate with fishpaper between groups if that makes any sense. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/9/c9f44fbc2460658bd799867c1997d3c2f0bfca9e.JPG" width="375" height="500">

@chaka @Jinra

What happens when a fuse blows?  I mean, do  they blow one fuse at a time, or the whole P group of cells blows?

I worry about the following scenario: If someone rides hard so that a fuse blows, then the current through the remaining fuses in the same P group sharply increases, so that all these fuses are also likely to blow at the same moment.   Now this guy ends up in a situation when he rides very fast and cannot control the board - not good.

I guess this is a lesser problem for a 6P setup.  But I am planning to build 10S4P pack with 30Q cells.  Should I worry about this?

@scrapheap   Thanks, I've carefully read through that thread.  But my concern still remains.

For my first build, I was thinking a lot about using a fuse on main battery terminals, but after I read that @Jinra had an accident because of a blown fuse, I decided not to use it:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-fuse-do-you-use/6457/41

Cell level fusing looks like a safer option because one blown fuse does not mean that your esk8 shuts of.  But it may not be that much safer in this respect.

As many people wrote here, fuse wires often come loose (because of vibrations, bad soldering, etc.)     If one or more fuses wires come loose, you many not immediately detect it unless you balance charge your board every time.   (And even if you check balance every time, you can detect it only when you charge.)   The cells will become unbalanced, and I am not sure that a BMS can help with this.

So the battery pack may be compromised, but the rider will be totally unaware about this. 

Say, in a 4P setup, if one or two fuse wires in the same block are disconnected, then this P block is effectively 3P or 2P.   If the rider puts it under stress (hard acceleration, going uphill for a long time, or both at the same time, etc.) it may easily reach the breaking point, where it was working fine last time.  If this fuse blows, this immediately makes the current through the remaining fuses in that P block (which are already close to blowing) 2 or even 4 times higher than they should be.  I am pretty sure that these fuses will immediately evaporate.   So the board will shut off at the moment when the rider least needs it.

Tesla uses cell level fusing, but they have huge number of cells in P blocks.  If a few fuses blow, it will not have a big effect on currents through remaining fuses.   For esk8, where people typically use 3P or 4P setups, cell level fusing is more questionable.

I am not trying to say that it is bad.  I am actually trying to figure out if and how to do it in a safe way for my next build.  But there are lots of questions here.

With commercially available fuses, we know exactly when they are supposed to blow.   With fuse wires we can only guess it.   There are so many parameters here, not only the gauge of wires, but only the length,  the amount of space and ventilation around them, heat dissipation, etc.    Basically, there is no way to figure out the blowing amperage, unless one does a thorough testing of a given battery design under various conditions.   Apparently @chaka does it for his packs.  But I am not sure that I can do it (or even have means to do it).

If the amperage is too low than the battery is not safe (can shut of easily), if it is too high than cell level fusing defeats its purpose.
```

@Jinra  Thanks.  While I was typing my post, I found that you already answered some of my concerns.

So what is your recommendation?   No fuse on main terminals, but cell level fusing?

Do you recommend 20 awg wire?  (In earlier posts I found that you advice against 22 awg.) 

I am trying to figure out how to do it for 10S4P pack arranged in two layers.

Here is my idea:    

For each 4P block cut a blank PCB to the rhombus shape that covers the positive ends of the cells.   Drill 4 holes in the PCB for the cathodes of the cells.  Solder a 12 awg flat wire to the PCB so that it goes between the holes.  Glue this PCB to the positive ends using silicone.  Solder fuse wires between the cathodes to the flat wire.

So fuses wires will be very short - probably a few mm.   But I don't know how to figure out the correct gauge without doing extensive field tests under various riding conditions.

Any suggestion?  Do you think that this will work?

Seems like a bit of a design limitation in the way we use BMSes. In theory they should be able determine when a P group isn't healthy (say a cell fuse blew), as the voltage sag would be higher. With the way we wire them up they have two choices; keep the current flowing, or shut down to protect the pack (and forget the rider).

Really what you want is for the BMS to tell the speed controller that the battery pack isn't doing so well, and to back off the current. I'd imagine something like that happens in Boosted/Evolves.

It would be much better if, instead of shutting down, a BMS would make a warning, say, a loud beep if something is wrong.   There is a simple LiPo voltage tester that does just this - gives a loud beep if voltage of some cell gets too low.

Actually, I am not planning to use a BMS.  I will make VGA balance connectors and charge the battery using a balance charger.  This way I can easily see if there is a problem at charge time.  But I want to implement some protection.  

My main priorities:

1.  Safety while riding.  I don't want to add risks of blowing a fuse or blowing a BMS.

2.  I don't want the battery to go in flames.

Cell level fusing sounds like a great idea.  But it has to be done correctly.

So, why fuses have to be on the positive side of cells?  This was discussed in this thread, but I did not get the explanation.   A fuse on the positive side can short as likely as on the negative side.

If I eliminate any possibility of shorts (thinking to use fiberglass fr4 plates between cells and fuses), can I put them on the negatives of cells?   Is there any other electrical reason for them to be on the positive side?

More precisely, for easier access, I want to put them in alternating way: 1st P group - all fuses on plus side, 2nd P group - all fuses on minus side, 3rd P group - fuses on plus, etc. 

Also thinking to use flat wire like this instead of busbar:

I'm all for cell level fusing, but it doesn't mix well with any kind of BMS, even if it's charge only.

If a fuse blows, then the others in that P group take extra load and likely blow as well during riding.

And if any series connection breaks within the pack while you're riding, suddenly your VESC turns off and you're now feeding your full pack voltage through the balance wires surrounding the series connection instead of the expected 4.2V max difference. This situation would very likely burn up your BMS and i'd even go as far to say it's an unnecessary risk of fire.

Why is that ? 
Sorry, did not read the whole message. 

Regarding the first point, if you design your fuse to blow with the continuous discharge rate of the remaining cells, then it's true. But if you assume that a shorted cell can deliver much more current in a short that its max continous discharge, you could design the fuse to be large enough not to blow with the remaining cells, couln't you ?

You could, but then you have the issue of uneven discharge because you wouldn't necessarily know that you blew a fuse, it's inside your enclosure. For a 2P pack that means you'll deplete the p group twice as fast as the rest, and after that... cell's dunzo. A BMS can't correct for that kinda difference in capacity.

You cant technically distinguish missing cell in P group. The only thing that can change it will discharge faster as capacity is lower which would make P group voltage lover than others but balancing can hide it...

It changes, but not right away, the voltage will drop faster in this group, and also the sag will be bigger

I didn’t get the problem with the BMS and cell level fusing, or are we talking about the main fuse blowing and all current count through the balance wires? If that’s the concern just add fuses to each balance leads, there are some smd fuses that are really small

I chose to use 2 12 gauge wires as I don't have any braided copper wire. I read someone say that the braided copper wire also wicks a lot of solder making it rigid. I don't know what the amp ratings are for the braided copper wire but when choosing a solution for my batteries I wanted to try to reduce the amp draw over the nickle strip so I put 2 pieces of 12 gauge wire between the cells so fewer amps were being pulled across the entire nickle strip.

No it would be better if the main fuse blew. But if all the cell fuses blow in one P group then the balance wires surrounding that breakage will be exposed to full pack voltage instead of 4.2V. the current is irrelevant (but inevitably more) and the extra voltage is what will do the damage. The components on the balance board portion of a BMS are not rated for something like 42V. And last I checked, there's no such thing as a fuse for voltage 🤔

Actually, if a load is connected to the battery (like a vesc) then the two P-groups that have been separated effectively become the new + and - terminals of the entire pack. So the voltage will not drop to 0, it would drastically increase. A vesc always uses power even when idle and is therefore a load.

Well, unfortunately the most likely time for breaking a series connection is when you're pulling a lot of current through the vesc, which is what would blow your cell level fusing (theoretically). So that resistance I would say is negligible.

It doesn't matter what the resistance is between those contacts is. normally, it's infinite actually, when the cells aren't being actively balanced. But the voltage is far exceeding any spec for components, a transistor can only prevent a certain amount of voltage from passing through before it blows up.

So yes, going from 4.2 to 50V is inherently dangerous. You may not start a fire with that, but at the LEAST you're going to brick your bms.

Yeah also remember the ratings on these wires are at way longer lengths, we use mere inches of wire and run short burst of high amps not really constant. My battery will be capable of 160 battery amps constant but I'll never encounter a situation where I'll use 160 amps for more than a few seconds at a time.

No. it won't. It will break. The components on the balance leads are not rated for 50V. Everything else you said is completely irrelevant due to that fact.

I suggest you convert your 50V esk8 charger to have a USB output. Go ahead and plug it into your laptop, see what happens.

A BMS will be damaged by a series connection break within the battery if there is a load on the main battery terminals, full stop, end of question, no other possible outcome, period.

But you haven't explained how in a real world scenario there would be a load on the main battery terminals? Which is exactly what the rest of my post was about (i.e. not irrelevant).

Using your example of a 50V battery capacity meter. If you put this in series on a 50V circuit, the voltage would be 50V across the battery meter, yes. 

Insert two leads of a BMS in series into that circuit. Nothing will happen. The internal resistance of the battery capacity meter is so high, it's effectively as though the circuit is broken. It has to be this way, otherwise it would blow up in everyday use. V=IR

I don't know what would happen if I put 50V across the usb terminals of my laptop - I've never tried it. But is it really the slam dunk you're going for? Would the laptop actually complete the circuit? Regardless the point is irrelevant - the USB circuitry of a laptop is not a battery management system designed for use with a 50V battery. And before you get all sassy on me, yes I understand a BMS is not designed to handle 50V through its balancing circuit. Just... redundancy etc etc... I'm not saying the internal resistance of the BMS is high enough to withstand 50V at 80A... but at 1A, would the current be strong enough to overcome the resistance?

An ESC with no throttle must have a fairly high internal resistance. I appreciate people disconnect these when not in use because they always draw a current.

Lastly, maybe dial down on the churlishness? This is a discussion in a thread for people asking for help with battery packs. I'm not claiming to be an expert. There are plenty of people who seem like experts in this area who are using cell-level fusing. I'm only trying to work out whether I should bother, because it does seem like a lot of hard work.

This does not affect anything. The resistance can be as high as you want, but so long as it is not infinite, you will read voltage across the load. Try taking a 100k resistor, in series with a multimeter, touch the other end of the resistor to the positive terminal of a 9V battery, and the negative of the multimeter to the negative of the battery. You will read 9V. Even if it's a million ohms, even if it's zero ohms, if there is not current flowing then you will see full voltage.

The current would be 0 amps in this scenario (until it possibly fails closed or something). Current doesn't matter, it is still being exposed to high voltage. Transistors, especially small ones like these, are VERY sensitive to overvoltage.

Yes, which is why I'm trying to explain how people making battery packs should be cautious of this.

If for some reason your fuses blow inside of your battery, don't assume that the BMS is functional. You could end up causing more damage by using it again.

Know the risks. You reap what you sow.

I've explained the risks. It is okay if you don't comprehend WHY this is a risk. Just understand that it IS a risk. I've done my best to try and explain this in simplest terms, and I can't do more. The youtube video is a GREAT simple explanation.

just because you don't understand something doesn't mean it's okay to potentially misguide new users who want to learn. It is a risk. BMS's have been broken this way. It doesn't just apply to cell level fusing, it applies to bms's in general. it's simple. Don't disassemble your battery while the BMS and the vesc are connected, simple as that.

Anyways, this is getting too off topic. I'm done discussing in this thread, if you'd like to start a new one just for the sake of arguing a moot point be my guest.

Cool, thanks. Sorry if I’ve misguided anyone. I’ve been careful to frame my comments as questions for this reason.

I think I’ve more or less figured out my last question as to why this is specifically a risk for packs using cell-level fusing. In packs which don’t use this fusing, a bad 18650 will effectively act as a short for the others in that p group... eventually the whole p group will go bad, and just act as an extended series connection between the p groups either side. Is that correct?

So... cell level fusing - you are suggesting the risk outweighs the reward? Anyone advocates for cell level fusing care to weigh in?

I'm pretty sure I don't want to get into this discussion about BMS and cell fusing together. :dizzy_face:

If I was going to cell level fuse I would have the fused sized to only blow in a short circuit situation to prevent thermal runaway but not to prevent thermal runaway from heavy amp draw, that issue should be solved with good pack design and safe Vesc amp limits. 

And cell fuses or not I would not trust a regular BMS to keep my pack in good condition. That's just blind faith. :fire: I would only use a BMS if it monitored P group voltage sag or I was monitoring them with another method so I could see when one of the P groups lost capacity or was acting weird.

I decided against cell level fusing after the above discussion. At the time based on my limited reading I considered it the gold standard of battery building. I weighed up the stated benefits of cell level fusing against the risks set out by @TowerCrisis and figured it wouldn’t make sense for my situation for the following reasons

- considerable extra effort to do cell level fusing
- planned build is 10s3p... the risk of a bad cell ruining an “entire” p group is not such a big deal if we’re only talking about 3 30qs
- my bms is from aliexpress and took over a month to be delivered, blowing it would be a total PITA

@TowerCrisis Cell level fusing is to prevent catastrophic damage from a resulting fire. Not to prevent damage to components. 

Say your board has been run over by a car, cell fusing will help prevent a fire should the pack become damaged. Or lets say the box you shipped your board in becomes crushed, the cell fusing will help prevent catastrophe and possible loss of life. 

I haven't gone through this whole thread since I have been back but I don't think it is a great idea to dissuade people from this method of construction if they have the desire to and means to do it.  I know I sleep better at night knowing my packs are fused at the cell.

Why do automotive makers do it? I like the idea of isolating a rogue cell.

This would be much more your knowledge area I’m sure. Surely a rider would ‘know’ something is up from the time the power/current drops a bit? 

The premise of destroying the rest of the pack due to a loss of 1 cell of the P, I dunno.

You would have to be pulling more amps continuously then that P could provide for some time to make it also go bad and then the fuses should start going on that too. I guess it depends on the current demand on the battery config
```

Well, it depends.

Plenty of electric cars and hybrids don't even have significant P groups because they use very large prismatic cells (like 80 Ah each) so they don't do cell level fusing.

Ones like Tesla baby their cells so much that I'd be surprised if a single cell ever fused out on their packs. I'm no expert on their batteries, but if we're talking 50 cells in parallel, then one cell going out isn't really bad. 49 cells vs 50 is only a 2% difference, which could be corrected by a BMS. In addition to that, Tesla's cell level fusing is mostly for complete failiure, like a piece of rebar stabbing through the underside of the car. It will slow down the thermal runaway enough so that the passengers could get out of the car.

Keep in mind, their battery management is far superior to anything we use. It monitors P group performance, keeps track of which cells have likely gone bad, and has a multitude of safety features and a level of "self protection" that our BMS's will likely never reach. They need this kind of ultra safe environment because they need a tremendously low failiure rate. Even 0.1% of these packs having issues would lead to a recall.
