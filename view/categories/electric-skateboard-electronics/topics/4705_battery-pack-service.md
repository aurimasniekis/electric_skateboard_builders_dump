Hey guys I'm looking for someone to build a battery pack for me. I'm thinking about purchasing 20X Samsung 25R batteries to make a 10S2P pack. The only problem is I sold my battery welder and no longer have the ability to make a pack. Would anyone be willing to let me ship them my batteries to weld the tabs and ship back? (I would pay of course) Located in US.
