Yesterday the twin 6S ESCs I ordered from @torqueboards arrived in the mail, so some cables and adapters had to be made. I didn't have what I needed to make a proper signal splitter for the receiver, so I left that out of the post. But oh my do we have power and motor cables!

I was expecting something totally different when I came here.
and I gotta say. 

I'm disappointed.

*very* nice work LHB!  Surprised you are running an adapter for the ESC's.  I'd expect you to swap connectors on the ESC or motors?

I thought about just replacing the connectors, but i decided to keep the ESCs in original condition just in case i needed to send them back for some reason. I doubt i will have to, they are performing very well so far. Also, making the right cables for the right job is pretty critical for cable management, and i think we're all trying to find ways to cope with the spaghetti monster that lurkes inside our boxes. 

Since I already had both sizes of bullet connectors laying around, i made those motor wire adaptors by grinding down the outer diameter of the solder side of the 4mm male bullet connector and sliding it into the solder side of the 5.5 mm female bullet connector, then i filled the whole thing up with some lead-free solder i'm trying to use up. 

I usually use my lead-free solder when making connectors and cables because typically i'm just filling holes with it and i don't really care about how messy the puddle of flux gets or its slightly higher melting/flow temp.

These all look really nice @longhairedboy ! Here's my entry; I just finished my first homemade serial connector. I've been practicing with my new iron; honing my soldering skills before I attempt to solder wires to my VESC. If we're following the pron [sic] analogy; your cables are "triple A" titles, and mine are amateur gonzo! But still, progress!

I made this after getting some good advice in this thread about [wire gauge][1].

looking good @treenutter  here's a little tip for deans connectors: always solder the +ve lead first.
It makes it much easier.

on topic: while I wouldn't exactly call it cable porn I recently took a photo of the inside of my box with wiring. Unfortunately I ran out of red and black heat shrink and had to resort to ugly blue stuff..

as you can see I minimized connectors by removing them all. with the exception of the deans charge port and balance leads.

Awesome @lowGuido, and thanks for the tip about soldering deans! I'm trying to figure it out from your pic, but how did you connect your balance ports together?

this is if you don't want to make one yourself- you can also see a little better in the ebay picture if you want to make your own.

yup. that's pretty much the one.
although I custom made mine to fit a lipo alarm in parallel as well. (its hard to see in the pictures.)

Thanks @cmatson, now I understand how this is possible. I'm using two 4S Lipos in series to make 8S. If I had a charge that could handle 8S i could make a port like this one, but mine only handles 6S :frowning:

Great diagram @lowGuido. I sketched mine on a piece of paper, doesn't look nearly as good!

Something that picture doesn't show you so well is that a 6S balance charge conncetor has 7 leads, but a pair of 3S balance connectors will have 8 leads between them. What it doesn't show so clearly is how to resolve that. 

I believe the black wires go together to make a 7 out of the 8 and the other 6 just line up in the order they are already in with the black one on the end. 

Also, here is an 8S charger:

You may be able to find a less expensive one, but once you get past 6S the price just keeps going up.

I thought I made it pretty clear.
here's an edit with less clutter
