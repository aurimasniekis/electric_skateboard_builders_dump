I reached out to battery bro to produce my batteries and this is what they said.

Low aH for a 5p pack - they are 25 amps per cell draw - 125 amps at 44volts?
would Samsung 30Q's be a better option? 15 amps per cell - 75 amps and 15 aH's?
What application are you building this pack for?

I agree with you and have already asked for batteries above 2500mah also for 100a safe continuous current. Building it for dual drive boards and to resell.
