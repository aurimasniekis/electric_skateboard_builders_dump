Thanks to Josh Hess & His forum here: https://www.radicalcreation.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=23

We now have a great photo comparison of:

**Enertion R-SPEC 6355  -VS-  Alien Power System 6355**

_Let me firstly say that josh seems a bit biased towards Alien in his review, he also recommends you buy their products at the end of the review & his tone used during his review seems to be anti-enertion. This is what Josh had to say;_

> I have had an excellent experience buying from them and their (alien) products are by far the **best price for the quality you get**


NOTE: Josh is wrong... 



## **So let's look at the FACTS!**
----------------


**The price of both these motor options delivered to the US for a dual drive eboard.**

2X Alien Power System 6355 + Shipping to West Coast USA is  **approx $186USD**
2X Enertion R-SPEC 6355 + Shipping to West Coast USA is **approx $235USD**

## **ALIEN IS 20.85% CHEAPER** 


----------


**Now let's look at the stator size difference. Because if you didn't already know that is what determines max power, torque & horsepower of a motor.**

Josh says the Alien stator is the same diameter but shorter, it only has **55 Laminations**
The Enertion Stator has **70 Laminations**

## **ALIEN STATOR IS 21.42% SMALLER**

**NOTE: This also means approx 21.42% smaller magnets, 21.42% less copper**


----------

**So which motor has the cheapest stator cost ratio?**

Cost per lamination of the Alien Motor is $186 / 110 =  $1.69 per lamination
Cost per lamination of the Enertion R-SPEC is $235 / 140 = $1.67 per lamination

## **R-SPEC Stator Laminations 1.19% Cheaper**



----------


**Now let's look at the Build Quality**

Here is a photo showing the Alien motor with a bend in it. Josh said he bent it with his thumb when reassembling the motor.

You can clearly see the differnce in the thickness of the alimunim parts, the enertion R-SPEC has much thicker profiles making it less prone to deformation.

----------

## LET'S SUMMARISE THE FACTS

**Enertion R-SPEC 6355 vs Alien Power System 6355**

1. Enertion Stator is 21.42% Larger - Higher MAX Power, Deliver More Torque & Horsepower
2. Enertion R-SPEC has larger magnets & more copper.
3. Enertion Cost to Stator Size Ratio is Lower than Alien by 1.19% (You pay less & get more with R-SPEC)
4. The Enertion R-SPEC has a more robust design with thicker aluminium profiles.
5. The Enertion R-SPEC is also chemically treated to make it water-resistant.


----------

## I have said it before & I will say it again, You get what you pay for!


----------

"Moving on the the rotors. Enertion made a big fuss about how all inexpensive motors use only "glue" to hold the magnets on to the rotor and that they use a special spacing ring to hold theirs. Again, this is just a bunch of BS hype to get you to pay more. Number one, this is not "glue". It is application specific epoxy formulated specifically for this purpose"

WOAH WOAH guys. I support Enertion in everything he does except his motors due to the iron curtain behind what would give you the best value, and what would give you the best yolo performance. Untill Enertions motors get more unbiased testing  , the enertion motors will be a Ferrari that no one wants to buy and SK3s will be the Nissan GTR that everyone loves. Dont flame on Enertion just because of the motors.

Well before everyone starts to crucify Jason for running his own business the way he wants to let me ask you these questions. 
How would you do it differently? I mean, if you were actually providing "any" parts to the community. Providing 1 part in quantity is difficult enough without crowd funding. How about 10 different parts?

I think it's kinda bad PR to just defend your motor 24-7.. 

If people say something that's wrong, correct them, but I don't think you have to attack every detail.

Mercedes doesn't try to sell it's cars to honda or toyota customers... they know people will always gravitate towards the cheaper option, even if the better German engineering proves to have much higher performance. 

you just gotta accept that no matter how much promotion and numbers get thrown around, most people who are dead set on a cheaper budget are going to go with a cheaper motor..

Like it or not guys.....


The photos above are not mine.... 
The calculations are based off facts...
The cost to lamination ratio favours the R-SPEC...

**But everyone still happily goes around saying the R-SPEC are way too expensive! More than all the other motors....** 
**Of course i am going to speak up!!! don't expect for one minute i am going to be silent about the truth in front of our own eyes**.

_A real estate agent who has a 4 bedroom house is going to walk you through it, she will show you the inside and the qualities so that you can better understand why the price is greater than the 3 bedroom house you are comparing it too..._

So now we have 3rd party evidence that they are in fact bigger & cheaper than another motor on the market....

And you guys a bitching about it? This info was actually show to me by my competitor, otherwise I would not even know about it.

So as consumers you don't you want this info?


I am more than happy to delete this thread? 

Just reply with this statement "I don't want 3Rd party product comparisons and facts about products"

the alien motor reviewed is a higher kv rating witch could explain the smaller size.
[/quote]

motor KV & stator size are not directly related.... you can have a larger stator & a lower kv!

increasing the stator size costs more, requires bigger magnets & more copper, so it not something the china factories like to do.

Anyone is capable of purchasing my motors to see the insides of my motors.

Because you take a hit you want to throw me under the bus? lmfao..

I don't claim to have the best motors unlike you try to do. There's a difference between quality and over-paying for fake quality.

The false economy - Don't get duped into paying for something you don't need.

My motors are ridden and tested and climb 20-30% inclines on a daily basis. What more do you want/need? You want to dip them in gold and pay $100 extra? Nah... no thanks..

People just want to ride..without breaking their bank. Something that's reliable and works that's not overpriced.

Why am I going to go out of my way to please you? You must think I got all the time in the world. :dizzy_face:

I'm not the one claiming I got the top of the line motors. That's for you to prove. You like to pretend to hold the big stick.

I obviously got smaller stators. I have sensors in my motors. Doesn't take a genius to figure that one out. I do this because it's not needed. My motors are tested and they meet my demands and my price point. If someone else isn't happy. I'll be happy to provide a refund and/or upgrade my motors to 24k gold if the community demands so. They can then go buy your overpriced paperweight.

So what are you trying to prove? Compare apples and oranges again?

Your motors are nothing to be proud of.. Anyone can make your motors.. LMFAO.

Everyone is so salty. Enertion motors are for people who want to have fool proof motors that wont quit no matter the price. Basically Plug and play. Other motors are going to require a little more diy at a lower cost. 
It is up to the consumer to decide what motor is best for them. Some will pay more so they wont have to think. Some will pay less and tinker and modify the motor.

Agreed. But this goes for all motors regardless of price. There's a lot of quality for low cost available.

The false economy - Don't get duped into paying for something you don't need.

This goes with my own motors as well. I'm not biased. I send people to HobbyKing, Tacon if they are looking for a more affordable motor.

The end of the day as long as there are more people riding. The hobby lives on :slight_smile:

@seanpain4 - You can purchase my motors. However, I'm currently running low on motors though and I'd rather have my customers enjoy the motors then send them to onloop. That's common sense.

I hope onloop has better motors than myself he charges more. I obviously have a sensored motor which takes about 5mm off the stator. So that would make onloop's motor bigger anyhow. Do you need the added power, No? You only put 30amps to your setup so what's the difference? Bragging rights?

I don't claim to have the best motors unlike onloop. You don't need the best motors to go 20-30mph.

I could immediately make the best motors and charge $120 but that's not my target market.

Hiding nothing. I've already stated.

Why pay more for what you don't need?

You don't need a Ferrari to go 80-100mph.

I climb 20-30% inclines all day with my motors and they meet my specs and needs. I'm sure, they would meet yours as well.

You are more then welcome to purchase from Enertion.

I've got two alienpowered motors, http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/6374-outrunner-brushless-motor-170kv-3000w/

They haven't let me down. This is not a competetion on who-ever has the biggest shaft (pun indeed intended)

It's simple really, they work, they go fast, good torque and they are reliable, the same goes with torqueboards, enertion, tacon and whatever brand / company....

Its just the best bang for the buck.(for me) 
I don't need to compare, it does what it has to do for a cheaper price.

This is just a consumer opinion.
