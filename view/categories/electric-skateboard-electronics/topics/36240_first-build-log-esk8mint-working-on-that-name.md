_WARNING: Noob Alert. Prepare for some cringe in case I chose totally incompatible parts or too overpowered/underpowered solutions._

Hello! First time posting here after lots and lots of reading around for research. I am now starting to plan my first build!

I didn't want to be that one guy that just blatantly never uses the search function and just straight up asks questions about every single detail of basics to how to build my first esk8. I tried my very best to research everything I need for my first board and I think I came up with a decent plan, but I am posting this just to clear out any mistakes I am not aware of or even better suggestions from you all. Think of this post as an assignment report from a student for all you expert teachers to evaluate and give feedback!

**My Design Specifications**

I started planning my build by just listing all the features and functions I wanted my first board to have. This is what I came up with.

- Budget Range **$350 ~ $400**

This budget was decided without any knowledge of how the parts were priced. The budget was solely based on [one YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdylrv1iSHI) I watched when I first learned about DIY esk8s. So if my specifications require a higher budget, it may be arranged.

- Top speed **30 km/h (18 mph)** with 100 kg load (myself + extra weight)

- I live in a hilly area, so better torque is a priority over top speed

- Range **16 km (10 miles)**

- Max weight 120 kg (265 pounds) in case I carry a lot

- Charging solution plug and play style portable solution (BMS for LiPo)

- Portable, reliable, and small remote (like boosted board remote)

- Would prefer VESC unless there is a ESC that is reliable enough for my needs and significantly cheaper than VESC solution

**Other specifications (These features don't have to be included with budget)**

- Battery indicator

- ON/OFF button

**Optional specifications (Just to be a bit unique, but not needed)**

- Speed indicator

- Lights _(with its own on/off switch?)_ for visibility for others to see me, not necessarily for me to able to see around me. _(I'll just use a headlight for that)_

- USB charging port for phones _(According to my really shitty searching ability I couldn't find much information about that. I need a bit of help to learn how to do this)_

- Terrain friendly airless wheels _(Just like [these](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/all-terrain-flat-deck-loaded-fattail-deck-mbs-matrix-pro-ii-trucks-mbs-wheels-dual-ollin-170kv-custom-mount-8s-vesc/7419) but airless, I just found them a bit expensive to me but if there is a product that is reliable and similarly priced to good 90mm wheels please let me know!)_

**What I'm still not sure of**

- Single or Dual? _(Since I weigh about 95 kg, I first thought that I definitely needed a dual setup, but you might prove me wrong)_

- Slightly flexing deck or sturdy as possible deck? _(I would obviously want comfort over bumpiness, but I'm also aware of the risks of getting flexed decks for setups that have electronics built on the middle of the board. Are sturdy decks that bad?)_

- Basically the math behind picking the right motors and batteries. _(I am aware of the website http://calc.esk8.it and also learned the basics of battery numbers and whatnot, but I can't really find people that are as heavy as me that found the perfect combination for a 30 km/h 16 km range board for 100 kg loads. Halp)_

- Gearing ratio for a powerful torque board that can climb hills like a  boss (Help)

**My Plan!**

This is the list of parts I am planning to get. Note that I didn't pick a deck yet because I wanted to pick my parts first and get the needed area later to pick the right deck afterwards. Also keep in mind it is my first draft! Mess it all up if you need to! I want to learn! (Or should I plan it the other way?)

[Google Sheet Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EcvpTkqyIVEbhrwzhfnvyirS5_ZNcUg6DnTLYAtBY2o/edit?usp=sharing)

The list doesn't include all the small parts like serial adapters or tools just yet, I just want to make sure my base parts are solid and ready to go!

Man, writing this post took me a while, it's bed time already (awww) I won't be answering questions for the next 8 hours and if I do come back I want to have a very solid discussion with you all! This is so much fun so far!

This won't be a complete set of recommendations, but I'll give you a couple pointers.

With that budget, you probably won't be able to go dual, and you'll probably be limited to lipo batteries for the same reason.
A single 6374 will have plenty of torque as long as you go with a 10s or 12s setup.

A speed indicator won't be that useful, since you really don't want to be looking down at the deck at speed.

Pneumatic wheels are awesome. They're expensive, but it's great not to have to worry about rough terrain.

yeah i realized my budget isnt that good for duals, but i think the setup i put on the google sheet has good enough torque? i just need a good gear combo and stuff i think

I would recommend spending some money on decent bearings, I doubt the bearings supplied with your wheels are going to be good... Also a bigger motor like the 6374 would probably suit your needs more.

Other than that, this is a pretty tight budget if you want such a system imho... I'd say you will probably end up spending around 500-600$+ in the end :smiley:

I've been riding a stiff non-powered board for years. They're not as bad as some people say and I like feedback from the road. Plus if you're going to run with all-terrain wheels, your ride should be plenty comfortable almost anywhere you go. Since you weight about 95kg I'd say go for a stiffer board. If you place your electronics right a flexible board isn't going to hurt anything, but the stiffer the board the more space you have to place everything.

UPDATE: I decided to buy the non electronic parts just to get used to longboards before I got into electric skating (The [parts list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EcvpTkqyIVEbhrwzhfnvyirS5_ZNcUg6DnTLYAtBY2o/edit?usp=sharing) got updated with darker colors for bought parts). I didn't buy a deck yet though

 I found decent looking decks on Amazon but I want to take a bit of extra time to research more about better decks for me. With @maxhost4's suggestion I decided to look for stiff boards so that it holds my weight enough plus more space to put the electronics underneath. Do you guys have any good website suggestions to buy decks with the price range of around $80 and below? I'd prefer a design looking similar to [this](https://www.amazon.com/Magneto-Longboard-Bamboo-Dancing/dp/B076DLJXB6/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1508801244&sr=8-6&keywords=twin+tail+longboard). If you have any other suggestions that you think I should consider, let me know as well!

How are you planning on charging your board? Gotta add the cost of a charger which is like $50 if you don't build one yourself. Overall you'll probably end up spending about $600 and that's about the minimum for a decent board. Alsos a link to a cheaper battery monitor that's also smaller.

That'll probably work. You might have to mount the trucks as standard trucks, not drop-through trucks, because space under the board is limited. You'll also have to grip the deck yourself, but that gives you a chance to do some cool artwork on the top. Nice pick man.

I've got a few more thoughts looking through your parts list. First, you're gonna need an enclosure of some kind to keep everything on the board. I don't know what you wanna do for it, but most people go with vacuum-formed enclosure/3D printed parts. 

Second, I'm not an expert on batteries (if anyone has more experience, please correct me) but I think you can increase your capacity relatively easily by using [these batteries](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-3000mah-5s1p-20c.html). By my math you'll get a full Ah more and it'll still cost you about the same.

Third, if you want to save a little money, look into a loop key instead of an antispark switch. More involved, yeah, but also about 90% less money.

Fourth, you might wanna think about supplies you might not have laying around. A sautering iron, loctite red, and wiring hardware aren't gonna be THAT expensive, but it's something to think about.

Finally, I agree with @ARetardedPillow on motor and VESC comments. A nicer VESC from OllinBoard Co or even Torqueboards is gonna go farther than a HobbyKing VESC.

I second another post about the motor. You will go over the Vesc erpm limit with 10s and a 260kv motor. Try to choose one around 190kv. Hobbyking has one I use for about $45. Just search for Keda 190kv

1. Thank you for your words for the deck choice! I am aware that I will be mounting the trucks under the deck not through it PLUS risers! Grip tape designing sounds very interesting. I will look into that too myself!

2. I am thinking of getting a standard lunch box enclosure for now, because I expect myself making many mistakes and opening the enclosure very often. I did take a look at some enclosures like @psychotiller’s enclosures and they look so good! Just that for now I will stick to a modular and a bit ugly design until the electronics turn out to be solid and reliable enough for it to be permanently attatched to the board. Just to also mention how im planning to mount it to my board, im planning to put two enclosures, One having the batteries and the other having the rest. Even though my deck wont have much flex I liked the design of having two separate enclosures at each one side. Also in the future Im planning to build extra battery packs!

3. I will look into the battery selection later today Im outside right now

4. I was planning to have an anti spark key too, I’m actually probably going to have that first before I even get a power switch for testing purposes. But you mentioned that I save about 90% my money? Can you ellaborate on that? I thought the only difference was simply a switch vs a key. Is there extra wiring and such that im not aware of involved?

5. The extra tools and small parts like wires and adaptors will be added to my list once my main parts plannings are solid. Plus sottering iron and such tools dont have to be included in the budget, I will need them in my later projects!

6. As I mentioned on the reply to him above, thank you for the comment! I will consider a much more reliable vesc than my “as cheap as possible” vesc i found myself.

Overall, thank you for the time for your recommendations I greatly appreciate it!

Take a look at this post [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-anti-spark-xt-90-loop-key/204) by @sl33py. He does a good job of explaining how it works and how you can make one. I'm pretty sure you can also buy them pre-made, but I'm not sure where (hardware stores?). Either way, it's way cheaper than a switch and gets the job done.  

Happy to help out. Best of luck on the project. Can't wait to see the finished project.

Thanks for the info!

I knew what it was and how it worked before I planned my parts list, but I still went with a switch just because it felt easier to use. Also I initially thought that it would look bad if u see a little connector with a loop sticking out of the board while using it.

However, now that I think about it I think those keys are good enough plus they look cool to use (for bragging purposes). I think I might be able to wire my deck up a bit so that I can plug the key inside one of the two holes of the deck that are normally for drop through mounting, and fill the other with a battery capacity indicator! Ideas are flowing through my head right now, but I am still in the planning process for the electronics. Gotta make sure everything i get is reliable and solid.

I will definitely be posting board pictures as I build it up right in this thread!

firstly: Make sure the loopkey is watertight if you're going to put it in the droptrough hole. maybe a 3d printed cap to put over it or something like that?

secondly: what are you going to use as a casing for the batteries and vesc?

1. May I ask why it needs to be water tight? In case of rain coming from above or something like that?

2. As I mentioned above, I'm thinking of getting 2 standard lunch box enclosures for now, so that it can be modular in case I need to fix a lot of things.

Yeah in case of rain or when there's puddles. I live in the netherlands which has the same weather patterns as the UK (rain. Lots of it.) so for me it's important averything is waterproof. Or at least rain/splatter-proof.

Modular cases are indeed a good plan for your first board! I accidentally read past the bit where you said that, oops

That actually leads to a question I wanted to ask, since you seem to know a bit about water proofing, what are the recommendations to do so? Just a lot of hot glue/silicone around spots I think have an entry point to the components? Also how do people get their motors water resistant? Isnt it basically a piece of electronic sticking right outside of the board being so vulnerable to everything? I heard hub motors are mostly fine with water (except for the wire parts)

actually, i don't have that much knowledge. I'm also working on my first build right now. 

As for waterproofing the motor, idk. Maybe it spins so fast it throws out the water as soon as it touches it?

As for waterproofing the rest: you can use soft silicone where the wires exit and enter the lunchboxes. I believe there are lunchboxes that have a silicone string inside that lid that makes them waterproof anyway.

I just realized what you said waaaay up there regarding the batteries...

I'm probably the stupid one here but how is 2 x 3000mAh 5S1P 20C going to be better than 2 x 5000mAh 5S1P 20C? How does the math work? My entire stupid knowledge of batteries come from phone battery capacity stuff where "oh 5000mAh lasts longer than 4000mAh"

Update that I think I should mention here,

According to some users apparently ZIPPY brand batteries arent the best quality... One of them suggest Turnigy.
I'm looking at [this battery](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-5000mah-5s-25c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html)... but it is a 25C rated other than the original 20C I planned.

1. Are Zippy batteries really not the best?
2. Would changing the 20C to 25C affect anything? I know it determines the peak amps of the battery and all but would it matter since I'm controlling the peak amps and all that with the VESC?

I'm an idiot- you can buy 4x 3Ah 5S1P batteries for about the same price as the 2x5Ah 5S1P batteries. You'll have a 10S2P setup with 6Ah and a 40C discharge rate. I should've explained better- my bad. As for which battery brands are best, I don't have the most experience with that kind of thing.

Yeah you’d wire 2 in series and 2 in parallel. Sorry for my piss-poor explanation. As for total capacity, you only add the capacity of batteries when they’re in parallel. This article here (http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/serial_and_parallel_battery_configurations) gives a decent explanation for basic circuit rules. 
Generally, the more batteries you have in parallel, the more range you’re going to have. The more batteries you have in series, the more power you can pull from your batteries (in general).

waiwait hold on I understand that total capacity is only calculated when in parallel, but does that mean the range of the board will be equivalent to 6Ah? The sole reason why im considering this was cuz probably the range would be slightly bigger than 10Ah..

No. The range will only be 6ah. You will get slightly more range with the 6ah than you will with the 5ah or were you going to put 2 of those 5ah packs in parallel?

Notice how I said "truck" instead of "trucks"

Yep, Amazon screwed up and sent 1 instead of 2. No worries though! Their amazing support gave me a full refund and allowed me to keep the truck! They also provided priority shipping for my new trucks. I chose the black version of the caliber trucks this time! It will look a bit better!

But what do I do with one single caliber truck lmao... I'm thinking of maybe selling it once I confirm that I get 2 proper black trucks. Or maybe just keep it and hang it on the wall in case I do my next project I guess...

I really need help with 2 things though. A motor pulley and the belts for it.

I'm currently looking for a 15T or 16T, 15mm wide motor pulley. For some reason all of these specifications didn't match up with online hardware stores.
I'm also looking for the 15mm wide belts. I seemed to never figure out what was a good length of the belt as well, and I really need help with that.

The rest (BMS and charging set) is on hold for now. I'm looking for a better solution for charging (maybe a custom made charger that uses XT90?) that can do 4-6 amps.I also couldn't find a BMS that was going to take literally a month to ship here (Virginia, US). I got myself the balance charger IMAX + parallel plate as a temporary solution. (I needed these to figure out how fast it charges in 6 amps and whatnot as well as just a solid charger in case the BMS solution doesnt work out)

[TL;DR below]

Alright been a while since update but basically everything except the BMS charging solution and extra hardware is now ordered!

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/4/248de1cfeb82cf98e3f43df6ef3718071592c436.png" width="690" height="265">

EDIT: [Here's the google sheets parts list link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EcvpTkqyIVEbhrwzhfnvyirS5_ZNcUg6DnTLYAtBY2o/edit?usp=sharing)

I also got a balanced charger for a more solid charging solution just for the few weeks until I get my BMS charging solution figured out plus in case the BMS breaks down on me.

But there are some slight regrets on my decisions, that can probably be resolved by refunding them to replace with better parts. I kind of want to switch my motor solution from the 6364 motor suggested by @pat.speed to a 6374 motor for a couple of reasons.

1. I tried to go for a slightly small motor just so that I might be able to do dual motor setup in the future, and dumb me thought my standard caliber 2 trucks would be enough to be dual motor proof for the 6364 motor

2. I didn't realize that single motor is really common and enough to get decent performance in my case. Now that I slowly begin to learn that single motor setups are quite common and powerful enough, I kinda regret it and want to get myself a [6374 192KV](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html)  from hobbyking.  _(Also, I see some other options that are 6374 168KV and 6374 149KV... price wise not much of a difference but how much of a difference is it performance wise?)_

Thanks to @b264 I got myself 2 [280mm-5M-15mm belts](http://www.vbeltsupply.com/280-5m-15-synchronous-timing-belt.html). The 280mm length was recommended by  live support when I asked what was the recommended length for a 40T 16T setup (I know im getting a 40T 15T setup but I was being polite because I realized they didn't sell 15T motor mounts). 

Also huge thanks to @mccloed for helping me out with the wheel pulleys! I bought 2 40T wheel pulleys from him with a set of mounting hardware for $25. He had some difficulty with his printer which ended up shipping my item a couple of days later but in return he offered me a couple of used 36T wheel pulleys in case I want to go speedy in the future! What a guy! Because of this I also got 265mm-5M-15mm belts for the 36T wheel pulleys (length also recommended by DIYelectricskateboards.com).

Now the things that I didn't decide on yet. The charging solution.
I did get a [10S BMS](https://www.ebay.com/itm/182822468137) from ebay for charging only and bypass discharge. I asked the YT channel I got the BMS solution idea from (I AM DELUXE) how I could charge my batteries faster and they replied I simply have to get higher amps with same voltage to get faster charging speeds than what they had (a hoverboard charger 2A 36V 10S). So I went looking for a charging solution that was compact, portable, and safe to use. I first got the idea of making my own charging port out of a XT60/XT90 connector set from one of @Tampaesk8er's comments on a thread. I directly asked him for suggestions and he mentioned that having higher amps than 2A can be a risk for the BMS because of its heat. However if you check this thread you can see up there [quote="JdogAwesome, post:15, topic:36240, full:true"]
Yeah I get that though in that video he didn't address the PSU at all. For $50 on AliExpress you can get a charger that will fully charge your board in an hour at 5A.

[/quote]

Considering that @JdogAwesome recommended a 5A PSU for my BMS charging solution I was kind of confused if higher amps for charging was going to be a risk or a great solution. It's probably obviously both risky but also functional, however I wanted input from you guys, the experienced ones.


TL;DR

1. I bought everything but BMS charging solution.
2. I regret getting a 6364 and want to get 6374 192KV if refund is possible.
3. Is a charger that is higher than 2A for the BMS solution a risky thing for the BMS or is it a functional way to charge the batteries faster?

I dont see any reason that it would be "riskier" though the faster you charge LiPo's the shorter life they have, though I think the decreased charging time is definitely worth it. And anyways even at 5A your still charging at below 1C so you'll still probably get around 300-400 cycles before you even start to see any capacity degradation. Oh and personally I was charging my 6S 10Ah pack at 8A and the BMS didnt even get warm, now at 12S I charge at 4A and it still doesnt get warm, except for when its balancing.

So, I recieved a lot of things today, including the genuine IMAX B6AC V2... but there is a bit of a problem with that product

The screen is flickering like crazy, the product seems to function well when I click around the buttons but I didn't plug in my batteries just in case something was wrong with the product. I contacted hobbyking for support for possibly a faulty product.

I know the product is genuine because I checked the code beneath the product on the halo sticker and it said it was genuine and the code was checked only once.

Other than that, my parts are all arriving very shortly! I hope it turns out well in the end!

Prototype seems to be finished and functional! Today was an exhausting but fun day.

Problems so far:

- For some reason if I turn off remote while vesc is on the motors suddenly go full throttle until I turn on my remote.
This seems to be my own settings issue, I will do my own research later just not now..

- Motor mount on caliber truck seems to be too loose, I might have to get help with welding or buying a better caliber truck adapter or something to be confident about the mount.

- Motor is doing some weird vibration movement instead of rotating sometimes.
I asked hobbyking about this sending them a video and they offered me in store credit of the same price of the motor to let me buy a better one! I ordered the 6374 168kv for better torque since torque is a priority over top speed for me!

- Enclosures might wobble a lot when riding in real environment.
This was a prototype made with a solid looking hook tape design but obviously it is not enough. I am planning to drill holes so that I can attatch the lid solid on the board with the hook tape still there as a secondary backup.

If you have any tips on the stuff listed above feel free to give suggestions!

About the motor going full throttle there is a setting in the Vesc setup under the name of fail safe or something to stop that from happening maybe someone else can explain better. 

As for the motor vibrating, is it happening at the start at low speed? If so this is normal for sensorless motors.

What motor mount are you using? Some people put heatshrink on the hanger to make it slightly larger so the clamp fits better

(I just realized my post written from my phone was so badly formatted lol)

1. Thank you for the info! I actually researched just a bit before I went to bed yesterday and I think I know how to fix it too!

2. Oh. I mean here is the video I sent to hobbyking but if this is normal then I guess I have a free motor.. lol

3. I'm actually using a sorta cheap-o one from amazon that uses a c shaped clamp thing which i thought would be enough but now that I see it really isnt the best way to mount the motor mount. What do you mean by heatshrink, you mean that tube that shrinks when heat is applied? How do people do it?

Well looking at the video of the motor something does look wrong with it. I actually have this motor and love it, so you might have just gotten a bad one from HobbyKing. It actually looks as if the screws/bolts holding it to the mount might be going too far in and hitting the stator. 

As for the heatshrink they just used it to make the truck hanger slightly larger so the mounts would clamp on tighter. Does your mount have set screws the go into the truck?

- Yeah I didn't request the 6374 just because the motor looked bad or anything, I just considered getting a better motor since the day after I ordered it after looking at some threads about their experience with their motors.
- I see how they're doing it now with the heatshrink.. I'm wondering if it's going to work with just tight electrical tape?

I forgot to add, I fixed the full throttle when disconnected issue. I had to re-pair the controller with the little turning notches all set to neutral in order to set the default fail safe action to "do nothing" when disconnected. It wasn't in the VESC settings as I expected.

2 weeks since I updated (because of stupid china customs holding on the motor pulley) and I tested the board outside and geez it was so powerful! Starting acceleration was nice, it handled small hill bumps pretty good and surprisingly smooth ride.

After the test ride I figured I might as well install my BMS and charging solution because it already arrived while the motor pulley was stuck in customs.
While installing, I did get some scaaaary sparks coming from some of the balance cables from the battery. I also did get some smoke but hopefully it was from the sparks and not the battery cells. I carefully tested the battery after that incident and everything seemed to work fine so I decided to continue.
After everything was wired up I tested the capacity using the capacity indicator, got the initial value and plugged in my 2A charger. After like 10 or 15 minutes I unplugged the charger and tested the capacity and 3% rose! Yay charging seems to work well with the BMS!
Currently I am trying to test if the BMS cuts off the charging when it hits 100%.

Overall, going great so far! All the parts have arrived except for one extra charger I found that had 4A charging. Hopefully the final version gets done by the end of this week!

These are the problems and questions I have so far.

- When I let go of the remote trigger while moving I get a sudden brake first and then start to slow down. I'm going to try to look for a solution where it makes the vesc slow down gradually when I let go instead of just cutting off the power to the motor.

- Should I be worried about the one battery that caused some sparks on the balancing cable while wiring it up or should it be okay?

- Can I plug in the loop key while charging to see how much capacity I have left? I never did this because most of the posts here say that I should leave the loop key unplugged while charging. I had to unplug the charging cable every time I wanted to see how much capacity it has.

if you read the specifications, yep

performance, I think it works great but do know that it is still in new condition and it might not perform well in the long run. Many many people in this forum recommend [Bestech](http://bestechpower.com/) but I went with this one since I don't really have the best budget plus I have a LiPo balance charger anyways just in case the BMS fails on me.

I have the same problem, bestech seems great but you need to buy 2 and shipping is 1/4 of the cost, supower is decent (debating on buying one) but on the pricier side, the one you showed looks promising, I have a balance charger at home and there is a balance board. Thanks for the response!

EDIT: Here's the balance board. I think @Hummie uses this one, im not sure, but seems good for a charge only bms alternative.

still haven't gotten them yet and are coming slowly.  I'll maybe hook them up but lately am into making a charger with these or a higher power version

But using that to charge a battery would be super slow, isn't it ? It says 68mA only.
And in the description:
> 2.This balanced board has no function of charging or discharging,and it cannot replace the protection board.When the battery is in the end of full charged,it will discharge by resistor to first fully charged battery,namely shunt and balance function

68ma is what it will burn off as heat in the resistor to balance I think.  it will charge at whatever rate your charger is charging at.  if charging too fast,  since only 68mah is possible to discharge, you could potentially be putting much more into the highest cell than this device could possibly be able to burn off and therefore have a cell go too high while charging.  how out of balance it would have to be and charging at what rate I don't know but it's not much.  @scepterr or someone has changed the resistor to make it discharge more.  without the higher discharge than the 68mah, and with a way out of balance cell, and a high speed charger, could be bad.

unfortunately it only balances a cell once it goes to 4.2 (adjustable to different voltage maybe with different bits?).  Isnt there a version possible that would balance constantly so even if only 68ma discharge ability it would be balanced before it was charging and that would enable the weakest cell to stay more within range? In that case it would be less likely to be charged beyond 4.2 with a fast charge.

  If the device wont keep the weakest cell under 4.2 or something not much more than that while charging then  it's just giving a false sense of security and asking for disaster

That means that balancer isn't really great. Given the price, it's not even surprising. I was curious as it's clearly different than a BMS.

but it's a part of a bms.  maybe your bms isn't discharging any faster?

The bms that @HumanMint is better to use in this case and probably most. 
My understanding is that the balance board just moves charges between the different cells to make sure they rise at the same rate, correct me if I'm wrong.

I didn't go through all of the ones they sold at bestech but looking just at this one it has the same functioning balancer as the plain discharge balancer I was looking at and works with 84mah, and only works with cells that have reached full charge.  

theres more going on and it has "overcharge protection".  How does that work?  it wouldn't make sense to disconnect a cell that was charged to 4.2 AND also use a balance function as described above.

Id heard there were balancers that were always on and not that just work when fully charged infact I thought that was the norm and now cant find any
