I have a 12s D223 BMS when I connect the battery and balance leads there is 41v at the load side even when the switch is open. What is the safest order to connect the vesc to it without causing a large spark?

The BMS has a e-switch so there won't be sparking during normal operation but, when I am connecting everything up for the first time what order should I make the connections. Should I connect the battery to the BMS and then the VESC to the BMS or connect the VESC to the BMS first then connect the battery?
