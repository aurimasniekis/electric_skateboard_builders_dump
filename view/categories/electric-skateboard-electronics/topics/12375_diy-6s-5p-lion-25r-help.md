Hey guys. Currently planning on building a lion pack for my esk8. Just wanted to get some opinions and advice. Going to get the Bms from battery supports and the cells from nkon. What's the best way to connect them up without spot welding?

Cell level fuse. Just search for it.
Currently i want to buy 18650 cells too. Would be good if we could buy together to get a nice bulk discount. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/18650-group-buy-eu/12067
