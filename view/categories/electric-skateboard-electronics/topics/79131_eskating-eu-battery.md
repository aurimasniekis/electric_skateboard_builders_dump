Customer service from that place is less than ideal in my experience.  Long shipping delays, wrong parts shipped, then rude customer service.

Hi, maybe some other owners will come here, i can just say we entirely build them in Italy with 30q and bestech bmss, as lots of users suggest here too. if you need more you can contact us via WhatsApp that's the best way.

I've only ordered from them twice, first order was 2x Focboxes, second order a motor pulley. No issues so far (haven't been able to test the pulley yet though). Shipping to Sweden was super fast with UPS drop off point. The Focboxes got sent the same day I ordered and arrived just above 24h after time of order. The pulleys took a day extra or so since they custom make them on order, but again, shipping was blazing fast.

But that's just my experience so far, not having to deal with customer service at all. For a battery I guess the risk of having to contact customer service is a bit higher than for my two orders.

I had nothing but good experience here.
All came in as expected and quality is sturdy.

Customer support is quick and solid.
The webshop interface is pleasing and works flawlessly.

Shop is well sorted and for european builders one of the best imho.

I can recommend @fottaz and made several orders and it have never been a problem.

Ive used a 10s4p battery from him for over 1000km with no issues.
Recently i orderd a new 10s4p with the besttech bms for my new build. 
Great custommer support imo

I order and make ordered much time from Alberto (VESCs, Motors, custom motor, and wheel pulleys, remote,..)  and I can say it's a really great service from my experiences.
(I'm a lipo guy but if I have to used liion pack, I will seriouly concider to order it from him.)
When he get delais on a parts he let me know or it's noticed on the website.
And the price are good :+1: 

Plus, I really like the good work made on every Eskating Beasts !

Awesome job @fottaz I wish you best wishes and good continuation for 2019 :santa:

I ordered a 10s3p enclosure from @fottaz it took about 1 month to get to Vancouver, BC, which is reasonable. No complaints from me.

Hi and thanks for your feedback! I love ups point too because is fast for you guys, and cheap at 11,99 eur is nothing in 24h, the fastest is possible if doesnt include batteries, drop off and batteries mean a day more or so...via road, not express

If you need any help you will try our support, let me know ;)

Personally never had issues with e-skating.
Three separate orders, fast shipping and instant communication via chat during and sometimes after office hours.


Never had to deal with their aftersales.

I have ordered a 12S5P from them 1 year ago'. The battery is still working fine.... But not thanks to the quality of the battery , thanks for the constant repairs re- doing all the packing, I even had welds come off. Fortunately I had a spot-welder by then.

Honestly Alberto is a all around nice guys, his store is great cause he has a wide range of products. But I'll give my honest opinion on this the man can be a bit greedy and his 6 month warranty is a joke we're not In china. The products  are outreagously expensive IMO. But he is enjoying the fact he is the only one in Europe having such a catalog.
 Europe laws state that there's should be a 2 years warranty yet when I told him and linked him the specific laws he laughed at my face and told me " you know European laws in Italy we don't really care". It's an attitude I cannot hear, I had spent thousands of Euros on this store. Now I won't buy anything else than fish paper and such when I don't have enough. 

After ordering a lot from him , I don't think his service is worth high € order. Everything is overpriced , guarantee is BS. I had to negotiate for some time to get a replacement 4A charger that broke on the spot ( 76 € the charger I thought I had a customer service for such a highly priced charger ) I had to negotiate for so long until he accepted , but not really happily it was just more to get rid of me and my complains.

Pure Italian attitude.
I don't wan't to be rude or anything, it's just my experience for ordering multiple time and throwing too much money at Eskating. 

I'd rather give my money to the true innovators of this forum 
bevilacqua , hummies , kug3lis , pimousse you name it....

Hi , I'm sorry to read all that bad experience with eskating. 
The prices I think are more than great and I don't remember when you ordered but we have improved month by month specially on batteries (we have 2 years in total). I thought we had a great deal via whatsapp that time, isn't it? Thanks anyway this help in any lack we have.
If you compare with the friend @e.board_solutions, we are higher, just because we make almost everything in italy and by the 1st january we'll get to the new vat system that will charge in vat. Our friend by solutions for example is still having the 0% vat system, maybe for the next year too, he can do what he want with prices.
I'm courious if he will be able to keep those low prices when he'll start paying the real taxes

Of course there are a lot of super diyers here that can send you something at a really low price because they donìt eat with it, they already do something else that pay the bills.

I pay 21% percent VAT since June  :see_no_evil: I think my prices are in line with other vendors. I indeed don't have to eat from it and I wouldn't be able to do that with the sales I have ...

Also the battery packs I sell are made in Belgium :) 

Anyway I think @fottaz offers good products for correct prices but we as vendors should always try to improve on service, quality and pricing :slight_smile:
