# Single Turnigy SK3 speed vs Dual SK3

While taking into account that i have a 66T wheel pully, 15t motor pully, 7 inch tyres and Space Pro 3, what speed would I get with a single Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-149kv motor compared to a dual setup? How would it manage hills compared to a dual? If need be, how do I make the single faster?

Thanks,
Cal

Why does the wheel size affect it so much?

```
It's mostly because smaller wheels have to make more rotations to travel the same distance.

Do you know how I could make it faster? I can't afford a dual setup sadly...

I would say the easiest and cheapest way is to get a higher kv motor and decrease wheel gear from 66t

What wheel size do you have? 

How many hills do u plan on climbing?

Its an all terrain build, 7 inch. There's not many hills in the area, I just want as much power as I can get...

Ok, I changed wheel size to your measurments, and this is the top speed you'd get in the current setup

This is with a 190kv motor

@ajaynagra he has a shop and sells some 190kv motors, he's also based in the UK

his shop : 

https://eu.electric-skateboard.market/store/polar/

you can also get the sk3 190kv from hobbyking, they have a UK warehouse, but keep in mind that these motors need a few modifications before you can use them in a build

or the 6355 190kv from alienpowersystem based in the UK

http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-6355-outrunner-brushless-motor-190kv-2200w/

All three are good options.

If you are very knowledgeable about motors and you know how to make adapters and modifications to suit your needs, then I guess you could go with that one...

I only recommended the ones I know people use in this sport

Do you already have the components listed?  If so, the easiest (reed: cheapest) way to make it faster would to increase the size of the motor pulley, at the expense of less torque

```
space cell can't put out half that power... so...
it would end up costing more then a dual

149kv is already 20mph... 15/60t gets 22mph. I think it would be a good speed for the ride height of pneumatics.

the 190kv would be good if you want to roll kegels...or hit 30mph but your range would be cut in half....

torque is what makes you go!
more torque = more acceration.

the setup you have would work fine. or you can use lipo but that is more work....
flier 12s esc seems to be the way to go for offroad wheels...

You would need to drill a small hole in the shaft, in order to be able to fix the pulley. The other motors come with a keyway from factory

Sure

In this thread, you can see OP using a SK3 motor, and how he says he flatened the motor shaft

https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=78970 

Ctrl + F shaft and read :slight_smile:

and here 

https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=80808&start=25

Ctrl + F shaft 

''finally I drilled 2 small dimples into the SK6374 168KV shaft. took a while until i figured out how to do that properly with the drill press but Im really happy with it - I hit the exact spot so that the pulley "snaps" into the right place by the 2 grub screws. dont think Ill have issues with traction like that and probably the shaft is less weakened compared to a keyway?'' 

So basically, the sk3 motors comes with a perfectly cylindrical shaft, which needs to be modified in order to fit a pulley. If you don't modify it, you won't be able to use it really

I simply don't have the tools to do this, however, I still would really like this motor. Is there any other way of modifying it so that it works with the pully system?

You could use strong glue but personally, I wouldn't do it. The strong vibrations would eventually rip the glued part away.  

You either drill the shaft, or buy a motor which already comes with a keyway.

LE : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4S9gxzQ39g this is how you could do it if you decide to go with the hobbyking motor

That's grinding a flat not drilling a hole?
```

---
## \#28 Posted by: jujet Posted at: 2016-10-20T10:29:17.594Z Reads: 113

Yes, there is grinding a flat which uses a key to lock everything in place

Or a hole, if you're going to lock the pulley using a small screw

Risk management. How much do you want to expose yourself 

Are you ok with the risks involved? (ie: going +20 km/h and all of a sudden the super glued part comes off ) If the answer is yes, then super glue would work just fine

I don't know mate, you're a pioneer if you're going with this method of fixing pulley on the motor shaft.
 Everyone else does it like I said above, either by drilling a hole, grinding a flat or just getting a motor which has the fixing mechanism already

What do you do once you grind the flat?

Edit- do I need to buy a key or does it come with the sk3 (it doesn't say)

P.s Last question, I promise! (;

No idea, I got the aps motor which comes with the flat already grinded. But I suspect you need to get a key from somewhere or make it yourself

It depends on which motor you get. The one I bought mentioned this in description : 

SHAFT: 10mm with 3mm keyway

If you're determined to "glue" it, use 2 part epoxy. However, this will be practically permanent, so make sure you've lined up things right and your happy with the pulley size/ratio.

Old thread i know, but as someone else revived it... there is no reason at to grind flats on motor shafts, just use retaining compound, its what its designed for.
