Hello
A couple of weeks ago I got a flipsky remote for the vesc
This is the remote and it’s module

And will be connected in this pattern

If I connect it to my vesc will I also be able to connect the xmatic Bluetooth module for iPhone?
If it won’t work, will it work if I connected the remote to one of the vescs and the Bluetooth module to the other vesc? (I’ll be running two vescs)
