After learning the electric skateboard in the market for now, I found some interesting things, most of them are not mass production, especially the boosted Dual, I knew it first, and then compared with two Chinese manufacturers from several aspects ,  the following is a comparison of the details：

Why don't you use a Boosted Board Dual +?

I'm guessing you are looking at the V2 Dual. The battery is replaceable. The remote is not using a push rod system. It is using a Hall sensor. Also the Boosted standard battery pack is using 26650 A123 LiFePO4 cells. 12S1P
