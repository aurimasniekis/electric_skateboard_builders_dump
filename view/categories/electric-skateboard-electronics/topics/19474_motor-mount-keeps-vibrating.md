My motor mount continues to become loose and vibrates on my trucks and I'm not sure what to do. I've put lock locktite/ thread locker on all the screws and have to keep tightening them. What should I do??

Might have to clean the threads thoroughly.
I had the same problem with one of my mounts, i used acetone and after that the tread locker worked the way it should.

Put them in a jar and shake em around a little bit after letting them soak for 10-15 Minutes.

post a pic of your mount, some of them having problems in the way they are pressed together.
