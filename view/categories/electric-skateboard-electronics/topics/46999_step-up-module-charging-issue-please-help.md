You need to connect another step up module to your current one, one isn't enough for 50v and 4.5 amps

Lol. Sorry man, you can't step up total watts. That would be getting free power. If you step up the voltage you use of some of the amps to do so. You're probably drawing more current than your power supply can supply.

Also @ARetardedPillow is messing with you because your post shows your lack of understanding about electronics ;)

You can probably step up the watts if you use extra step-up modules.  You might need 3 or 4 though

Haha I was kidding, what you're trying to do is trying to use a small battery and a module to power a nuclear power plant, it won't work

You need a power supply thats capable of supplying 60v 5a

got it. this sucks.
any ideas where to get a 12s power supply for less than 50

I could loan you some, but they are all currently in-use.  I'm selling all the extra power to the neighborhood

Your power supply can do 12V 2A which means **24 Watts** so thats as much as you'll get out of it

At 50V that's 0.48A

thanks but i think i will pass.
i will just have to shell out more money for a power supply.
damn it

Watts = volts * amps. You can't get more watts than your power supply can give you. If your power supply can supply 2A at 12V, that's 24W of power. Theoretically if you stepped that up to 50V, the maximum amps you could draw would be 0.48A. Due to non-perfect efficiency in the step-up transformer you'd normally get less that. The fact that you're managing to get to 0.82A could mean that your power supply can supply a bit more than its rated amps (but maybe not consistently or reliably, or for very long) or perhaps your current measuring is not accurate.

Also, once again @b264 was messing with you ;)

Do you have an old computer power supply around? The yellow lines are 12V and can usually do at least 15A. That would get you about 3.5A at 12S (50.4V). Solder the yellow wires together as a bundle (+12V) and then the black wires as a separate bundle (ground)

The safest and simplest option and the one I would strongly suggest is just buying the appropriate charger.

Charge it at .4A with what you have now. It'll give you plenty of time to read about how elecrocity works.

And just buy a charger until you've learned a bunch more. Else you'll have lots of fried parts and maybe a fire.
