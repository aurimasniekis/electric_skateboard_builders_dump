About a year ago, I accidentally blew up my battery. Over the year I’ve managed to find most parts (I ordered a new battery pack) but I can’t seem to find my Enertion nano x receiver. I’ve heard from this forum that the HobbyKing GT-2 receiver (not the gt2b or gt2e) binds with the Nano X controller. Is this correct? If not, is it possible ordering a replacement receiver without spending over $100 on a new controller?
