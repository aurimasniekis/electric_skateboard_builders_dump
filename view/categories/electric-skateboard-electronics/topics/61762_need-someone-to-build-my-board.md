Look no further. Find a mirror and you will see the most honest trustworthy builder that you can find. 

Seriously if you got all the parts, whatâ€™s keeping you from building it is your inability to learn from your mistakes. 

Start building it and read/search when you hit a roadblock. Make a few mistakes and try not to make them again. 

I knew nothing of building one when I started this hobby with a first gen meepo board. 

Now iâ€™m running carvon sdr with a battery I built myself.

Best advice ever!

However, there is always a big risk involved.

My first boards were build in a very poor and unsafe way, now that I look into the past I can understand that and bang my head with such rookie mistakes, a lot of shorts, insecure welds, poor solder jobs, overheated batteries, balance wires vaporizing, didn't know what fish papel and kapton was for, Damn being a first time builder is dangerous but if you are willing to risk you will learn a lot which is the most important thing in this hobby

Why did you suck so badly on your first build? Not enough reading? Or was there not as much information as we have now? I feel like in 2018 we have so many helpful people and info that even my wife can do it with guidance.

I still have not built my own battery becuase I look at my house and just canâ€™t imagine setting it on fire. I just kept saying I donâ€™t need to get all that supply for one battery....5 pack purchases now ðŸ˜’

Thank you for your reply but I only like to ride I'm not interest and really in building I just wanted to escape war that to go 35 miles an hour plus with a good range of 20 miles or so with a nice drop  Down deck at 60 years old I probly won't be riding much longer lol but I have a nice evolve carbon fiber but I ride to death but it's just too slow for I'm riding

My first build had these issues that I though were just normal procedures:

I used only one layer of 8mm nickel strip, it broke after a couple of months riding
I soldered the nickel strips because I didn't have a spot welder, cells overheated a lot, even changed color
I used bad quality nickel strips  they rusted after 1 month
I cutted the strips to be easier to solder decreasing current flow
I never used protectors on the positive terminals of each cell, got shorts a after a while
I didn't use fish paper between packs, they rubber and caused shorts
I didn't use fish paper between balance leads and battery, just heat wrapped, they vaporized after some months and could have caused fire
My soldering technique was not good, lack of heat and too much contact time
I used 37/63 lead, pretty difficult to solder, bad quality soldering jobs

I'll post if I remember more errors

Sent you my contact number. Iâ€™ll be riding to Venice beach tomorrow afternoon, so better to call me between 10am and 12pm tomorrow. What deck do you have? 12s4p is a fairly large battery which requires a long wheelbase to mount properly.

Yes Michael, that was one of them. I never used fish paper on those first builds, that should be mandatory.

The battery built is a thing itâ€™s own and you should have the right tools and knowledge to build a proper back.
The rest shouldnâ€™t be an issue.
Lot of people start there built from 0.
Like I did too. 
This forum is great! Canâ€™t say how much hours I already spend with reading and research...
But usually I found an answer to all my question.
And if no just ask, usually there is somebody here to help you out.
For sure it takes time and effort to do a proper built...but the more you can be proud after...for me the most satisfying feeling to look at my board and say...all this I made by my own...
If you donâ€™t have this time or donâ€™t want to investigate that time into this hoppy than it would be better if you directly would have bought a prebuilt board...

Maybe from here we will start to solve your troubles?!?!?...so

Whatâ€™s with your VESCs? What you donâ€™t understand? Where you stuck? What makes you frustrated?
