HI guys,

Tried searching the forum for other topics like this and didn't find any.  I was trying to re-config my unity with new settings because i changed the remote, and I can't seem to apply any of the changes.  I also tried to uoload the firmware from the app and it now times out at like 0.45%.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the android app on one phone, and I also tried another Android phone, and both give me the same issue.  

When i do the guilded setup I can get past the test and such, but when i get to the apply changes part after motor detection, it just hangs there.

Any suggestions and help is welcome!

I dont have a windows machine handy as I use Mac
