Where do I find **charge per cell** on hoppy king batteries?

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-5000mah-3s1p-30c-hardcase-pack.html

I'm trying to fill up the last part on the calculator

What do you mean? Fully charged is always 4.2v for li-ion and lipo. Charge rate can be anything up to 5A.

It's max charge rate, look to the specs on hobbyking.
For this battery it's 3C, so you can may charge this battery with 15A max
