Has any body got any good research resources for winding your own motors?
Thus far I've found more info on the EV forums than anywhere else :unamused:

Make a search for motor rewind and you'll find plenty of interesting things.

all the machining is done.  Id give you the bell with the magnets epoxied inside and the stator mounted so all you'd need to do is wind it and add phase wires and get some really thin high heat epoxy to paint the windings to keep them solid from vibrations.   omega sells an envelope of stuff you can heat and it turns to almost water consistency, remove the envelop separator to mix it and coat the winding but not on the bearings, wait till it dries and good to go.

Thanks @Hummie, I'm still in research phase for the moment. 
My initial thought was to take something like this scorpion [HK-4535](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/catalog/discontinued/motor/hk-45/HK_4535_10_Mkit/) kit that scorpion wind like this [HK-4535-450KV](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/catalog/helicopter/motors_4/hk-45_1/hk-4535_450_8/) for example, but with a delta wind at a lower KV.
Found some good info here and some more on other sights now like this turn [calculator](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2228201-Turn-Calculator-7-2&highlight=turn+calculator).
Have you got a link to the LC meter (hope I got that right) you bought for $15 you are using to test resistance and to look for shorts?
& finally what design features optimize a motor to run at a different voltage. For example I see motors of the above linked size rated for between 10s and 14s?

really like the envelop as it's a two part epoxy you can heat with them separated then pull the clip off to mix them and pour.  no mess.  
I don't know how much I'd sell all the parts for and have to see what the flying price of magnets is doing today.  But if you look at the gold motor in the first post,  Scorpion motor kits are definitely more expensive, smaller, and have very similar quality stator, if what I have isn't even better at .2mm lams and there's I think .25, and the magnets..they might win there as they have access to some unknown supply I've never seen anywhere for what I think are n50sh and I have n48sh these days.  both curved.  I could go on and on.

the voltage that is best to "optimize" would be the most efficient for the speed you run the motor at.   Lets say you have 12s battery and a 100kv hub motors and you ride at 20mph.  you will be sunk at maybe 60 percent efficiency.  but if you have a 60kv motor doing 20 you would maybe be at 85 percent efficiency.   the motor is most efficient when youre riding at close to its max rpm.  you can adjust the kv, or voltage to suit.   so you could go max 20 and be much more efficient.  60 vs 85 equates to over twice as efficient.  but if you want to go 30mph your out of luck cause your motor will be too small for the job unless it's big enough, and has a better km number.   kv tells how much torque you get per amp and that could be a motor as big as your car or small as an eraser, the lower the kv, means the inverse, kt, which is the torque constant, is higher, kv being the speed constant.   so any motor if would to a lower kv will have more torque per amp, but the km, motor size constant, reveals the efficiency of the motor, so a big big motor will have a good km number and be most efficient regardless of the wind.   
if you do a search on amazon you should be able to find a lot of sellers of the L/c meter I have.  does inductance and capacitance with awesome accuracy.  one day I'll hook up some long wire and see what 
strange shapes could create inductance or capacitance.  I use it to not have to count the turns I wind on the tooth.  you can just look at the number and try to match all the teeth or phases.  it also is a great revealer of shorts.  it also shows you if youre doing a crappy winding job and not keeping the windings in line.

stated motor voltages are really only based on the bearing top speed.  you can go higher voltage especially with better bearings.

so .2 lams they have in that.  very nice.  I know they do others too.
niodimium mags just like all of us.  but bit stronger.  and good machining at .4mm air gap.  better than you'll get at hobbyking.  got that.
but the price for the size you get....compare it to the 4752 stators and magnets I have and there's no comparison.  not that I have a price yet but know it will be much cheaper

Ive been doing a little bit of research in this area to try and make my own direct drive motors.
But is there any real difference between winding my own motor to a specific kv say 90kv and reterminating a ready made motor to wye to decrease the kv instead of just rewinding the whole thing?
Cuz i was thinking about just buying some turnigy sk3 149kv and changing them to wye to lower the kv and get what i need instead of just making an entire motor from scratch. Any insight?

I'm sure there is more to it but rewound EV motors are all _delta_ wound because they end up with ~20% more torque than the same motor/volts with a _wye_ wind. I imagine it is the same for us.

Ah, I see.
So Delta is just an all around better way to terminate them because it gives you more torque as wye just lowers the kv but wont have torque proportional to that of an identical delta motor?

from Ivan at [ivanbennett.com](http://ivanbennett.com/forum/index.php?topic=26.0)
_With a wye connection you would loose 20% of your torque, cause you would have 2 phases in series, almost doubling your resistance._
from memory the difference in resistance equates to a 1.73 difference in KV

Right, not sure if thats also true while acceleration.
I would wind mine wye anyways. You may ask wye:p? the answer is thicker wire can handle more amps. not to forget its less work to wind:p

I think Greco is going to do the 3D thanks mike

I'm curious about that Ivan link. He says 4 phases instead of 3 from the start which doesn't make sense. 

Yes three phases in series w delta one getting twice the current of the individual others based on the winding resistance. Ohms law.  And the y is simple with two phases (poles) in series. Does that mean more torque?  Will the amount of torque In the 3 equate to the 2?  It makes total sense to me that a delta has a greater potential for torque based on the 2 vs 3 phases electrified. More steel core to potentially use. Less magnetic saturation under heavy load. more teeth in operation. But i don't think in practice it works out to have more torque no matter how it's defined. (and I read with foc all three phases are energized in y which makes no sense to me).  but this is basic circuitry seemingly but not I guess and still confusing.  The lower kv and higher kt will have more torque per amp regardless of the winding termination or size of motor.  That's more torque.  But under extreme load makes sense for sure.  Less iron core switching losses as less saturation with more core to work w.  I'll read past first post.  
I mean y worse than delta w more switching losses because hysteresis is worse in the steel if it's magneticly  saturated. 
but they're talking about motors with fixed voltages.  different than us.  if you had a fixed voltage of 50 volts and had the option to go y or delta and you want more torque you chose y because it gives you almost half the kv.  almost double the kt.  kt and tv are the measurements of torque per amp so they decide the answer as to what motor has more torque.  so maybe I disagree with part of what they're saying.  and then the end the idea of having less copper....the whole thread is filled with confusion and at the end it's revealed.

Found a mention on [the scorpion web site](http://www.scorpionsystem.com/building_technic/HK-4035_build_and_review/) where the magnets are listed as _N 50EH - good for tempatures up to 200°C._
not sure what that means but it might be of technical use.

In short yes, but you will need to get in to the individual motor to see how hard/easy it will be. It is possible that it could be simple for example LMT build some of their motors terminated with 6 solid posts.

You can simply swap between winds externally by how you wire them ([pic at bottom of page](http://www.lehner-motoren.com/doc/man_30_series_en_11_2013.pdf)), or you can use their strap kit.

To contradict my earlier quote of _delta_ having 20% more torque: [here is a quote](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?666877-Rewinding-brushless-motors-WYE-or-Delta) suggesting _wye_ has 1.7 times more torque...

_Definition of terms_
_Stator - The metal thing that holds the wire._
_Rotor - The rotatin part of the motor. This is the can on an outrunner._
_Armatuer - houses one winding. Each motor has a number of armatuers divisible by 3. 9 and 12 are common._
_Turns - The number of tims a wire is wound around each armatuer_
_Delta - Most common commercial termination. **has three leads and no neutral piont**. Spins 1.7 times faster than a WYE termination._
_WYE - Less common in commercial motors. **More efficient in some cases. Has 1.7 times more torque than Delta**_

Why the differing information? Who knows its probably a first year EE error. Could be to do with the number of motor poles, inrunner v outrunner or voltage... we might be missing something fundamental.

@Hummie I think maybe the above neutral point could be what "Ivan" was referring to when he mentioned three v four poles?

I'm making it confusing.   torque per amp is determined by the kv or kt.  100kv is 100kv and same torque per amp regardless of if it's y or delta.
you can vary the kv and kt with the winding or termination.  if it has the same amount of copper in a motor and is the same design it will have the same km regardless of the kv kt.    kv or kt determine what voltage and speed the motor is best run at and km tells how efficient the motor is at producing that torque.   a big motor has a good km.  it will have very low winding resistance.  more efficient torque produced.  but more torque goes to whatever has the lowest kv,,,highest kt

More torque, lower kv is more torque.
You lose efficiency, but you won't recognize it probably. cause we don't run our motors on their limits, or just for short.
