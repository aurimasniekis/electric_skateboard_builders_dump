This controller is a little pricier at $60. It looks similar to the boosted board controller. Has anyone gotten a good experience with this?

I like the size, but the travel on the thumb dial is fairly short. Haven't tried it on a board yet, but I'm not sure if that may make the board harder to control.

It's a much different feel. I really like the GT2B and trigger control but where I ride, I like to be as inconspicuous as possible. This nano remote is about as close as you'll get to appearing like you're not holding a remote at all. If you're not concerned about looks the GT2B is still the best bang for your buck.

Well that depends on where you are located, i got mine on Aliexpress with freeshipping but it'll probably take a couple of weeks (i'm located in Europe, so i didn't want to buy from TorqueBoards or Psychotiller, which would probably be a lot faster if you are in the US).

I'm wondering if anyone can share their experience with this remote in combination with gloves, i have a feeling the thumb-trigger is to small to be able to feel through a glove, is this true?

The bump is actually a decent size, the movement is the small part, full throttle is 1cm. They are very lite and with practice will work well.

It is way to sensitive especially if you want to start from a standstill (compared to gt2b). If you're not leaning forward good luck. I wouldn't use it on a fast board or a high torque board.

Hi guys, 

All is in carbon under my deck so i guess if i put the receiver inside, i will loose the signal ? 

I found this pic of the PCB :
![](http://i66.tinypic.com/hrjyj7.png) 

I guess the right thing is an antenna ? Can i extend it outside my deck ? 
What kind of wire could you advise me to do it ? 

Thanks in advance for your help, 

J

Cf will block your signal ...the squiggly wire on the side of that pcb is the antenna ...need to get to the bare metal and solder a wire to extend the antenna outside ... Hope that improves the drop outs

I was able to bind a Hobbyking reciever to the controller. My winning reciever died as well. The hobbyking should be better at reception because it has a larger esternal antenna, not a pcb antenna. Also, HK recievers are very cheap. The inly detail is that the trigger works on channel #3 not ch#2 as I was expecting.

## \#30 Posted by: jallart Posted at: 2016-08-10T23:07:48.566Z Reads: 486

So, 2 solutions : 
  - to try to extend the antenna by solderind a wire to go outside. Any thin wire could work or i have to use a specific one ? 
  - to use another reciever, like this one ? [aliexpress receiver](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Flysky-FS-GR3C-FS-GR3E-3CH-2-4Ghz-Receiver-Fo-FS-GT3B-GT2-GT3C-GT2B-With/375156402.html). How could i be sure that i could bind it ?

I don't know if you can bind that specific reciever, but the hobby king 3ch works.

Nope, the trigger on the remote works on ch3 on the reciever. Haven't tried to see if the button in the remote is Ch1 or Ch2 on the reciever.

Gonna try to solder a wire as an antenna first :)

I tried one like it with my TB12s Esc's.
IMO, the TB mini RC remote works much better.
With the nano remote, I did not get full brakes and, if I went a little distance from the board, the remote would loose connection and the receiver would default to throttle on and runaway board. Same thing happened if I turned the remote off while the board was on. I was chasing my board down the street until it crashed into something and flipped over.
I never had these issues with the TB mini RC remote

```
The failsafe when losing connection can be set to coast by rebinding the remote, and unplugging the bind key while the board and remote are still turned on. If your motor is not spinning when you uplug the bind key then your motor will not spin when it loses connection.

Would be nice if these remotes came with more detailed instructions like that. 
I tried the nano for a short time and did not like it. 
I did not know how to set the fail safe, the throttle range was too short and I couldn't get full braking. 
Much better control with the mini RC, anyway.

Try not to get this controller if you can avoid it. It will drop out loads and its very unreliable. People have hurt them selves loads because of this controller and when it disconnects it would go fucking mental. Try to avoid it and go with this one on the right. Its a little more bulky but its very reliable! : <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/5/95c071673fa5e6a749c9a7a0398e5ef57300de27.png" width="281" height="499">

I've got the TB nano remote, while I'm not a huge fan of it (travel on the thumb switch it too short for great control) I've had no complaints about performance. It's never dropped out, the battery life is incredible, it even survived a spill on asphalt.

Yes, i got it from this seller. The first remote i got had a problem, as it would not keep its charge. So i could only use it, if i charged it right before i'd go out and ride. Fortunately the seller send me a completely new set without to much hassle, so i would definitely order from him again.

That must be the antenna, right? Btw, this is the Nano receiver. I think it would improve the range if it was possible to put the antenna outside of the casing.

Thanks guys!

It's not bad (but 60 bucks is too much). The pins on the receiver are long and stick out a bit! On one of my DIYs those pins shorted with the pins of the charging port! I bet you guessed it!!! VESC + RECEIVER = fried. Since the remote was programmed to that specific receiver, it won't pair to a different receiver So I had to get a new controller + receiver.

I bought this remote and it worked fine 2 days ago. But yesterday I tried to go riding and it wouldn't make the motor spin. My remote binds to the receiver with no problem (both lights go solid) but the remote will not control the motor. I tried going into the VESC tool and recalibrating it to see if maybe there was an issue there, but when I get everything setup for calibration my computer doesn't show the throttle neither up nor down. I'm very confused, does anyone have an idea if how to fix this?
