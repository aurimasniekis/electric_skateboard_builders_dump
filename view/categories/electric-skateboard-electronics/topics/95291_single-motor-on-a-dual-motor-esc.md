I am building a longboard with a single 6374 motor and plan to add a second when I get the money.  Is it possible to run a single motor on a dual motor esc such as this one:

yes, it should work. read some more here:

but just to warn you, this is probably oldest of all cheap chinese esc. you will be better to buy newer esc from wowgo/meepo/ownboard, braking is much much smoother
