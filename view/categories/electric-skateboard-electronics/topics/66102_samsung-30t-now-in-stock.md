Hey guys just wanted to give you a heads up, IMRbatteries.com now has the impossible-to-get Samsung 30T, the highest discharge battery in the market, a 12S3P of 30T (105A total discharge) will blow away a 12S5P of 30Qs (100A discharge) even if you run them at 20A instead of the maximum 15A suggested by Samsung.

Another interesting battery is the new NCR20700C (30A and 3500mAh) even though they are unicorns they are outperforming the amazing NCR20700A (30A 3100mAh)

I had an email from fogstar saying they had them in stock at what looks like a pretty good price.

NCR20700A is just like a VTC6 with a slightly better thermal performance. And bigger. Dont know much about the C version.

But the samsung 30T is really impressive in the thermal side of things. Runs damn cool that one.

Edit: ok, not that much diff in temperatures between A and 30T, until you factor in the available amp hours at the high current discharges. The most impressive part of the 30T to me is how freaking stable the available charge is at all the different discharge rates. wow.

I was planning a 12s3p to upgrade mi eMTB but USD 500 for only 36 cells is still making me feel uncomfortable.

Unfortunately, Fogstar does not ship to Peru or USA

Also perfect if you want a small pack with good range and low voltage sag.

I found these at 

https://www.18650batterystore.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=Samsung-30T&CartID=1

The reason why I posted this is because they have a Deal of the Day price of $10.99 for these batteries. 

First, does anyone have experience with this site? I have heard horror stories of fake batteries from places and this is my first build. Are these guys reputable?

Thanks,
Chad

What about this?

From what I read it comes from the same factory as the VAPCELL 20700 3000mah

This cells looks great but it's again not available in USA and Fogstar won't ship to USA. On the other hand I'd pay a little extra just to have 5A more discharge capacity with less sag for only 1mm more of diameter

Yeah that sucks

Although, fogstar only shipped to the UK a couple months back and I think someone got it shipped to EU because they asked for it via email

But then again it's a bit different

Also there's one that's similar to 40T

Those seems to be pretty bad only rated at 15A

The samsungs 30T can handle an insane 35A!!!!!! that's the king of discharge.

The Samsung 30Q is a 18650 cell, that means 18mm diameter 65mm length
The SAmsung 30T is a 21700 cell, that means 21mm diameter 70mm length

I've being waiting for these cells for a while

The samsung 40T looks also like an awesome cell!
40T max continious discharge = 25A
30T max continious discharge = 40A

40T has a better curve with 20A discharge and packs more capacity.
This 21700 40T cell performs much better than the 21700 Sanyo 4Ah cell.
![chrome|690x388](upload://pb7MKwfb8xsP5yVAWKMgadUL0tq.png) 

For small or big powerfull packs 30T is just a beast.
Below 20A / cell, the 40T gives just better performance.

That comparison is pretty nice, however if you are only going to discharge at 20A why wouldn't you use a regular/smaller/cheaper Samsung 30Q?, just because of SAG?

A 12S2P would be crazy with the 30Ts, I hope I can fit that on a Loaded Kut-thaka SS enclosure

Well at the moment the 40T is just very expensive but will drop after a couple of months just like the 30T so then it should be a nice cell to make a light but powerfull pack.

The 40T and 30T can handle double the current of the 30Q and the VCT6 and still remains the same curve, so if you draw 30A from the 30T will +- have same curve as you draw 15A from a 30Q (so they will have the same voltage sag while they are drawing double the amp)

It's just a nice battery if you wanna make a light board with less cells but still want the power.

Yes, but then you will have no room for switches, charger port, BMS, XT70 and wiring. You better stick with a monster 12s3p made of NCR20700A for 90A of discharge
