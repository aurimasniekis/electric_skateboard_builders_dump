Hey guys first build I have everything together now and now need to do the tool. I don't really understand what info I need to put into the thing. I'm running a tb 190kv motor 12s at 8000mah 35c in series. What info should be good let me ride over the weekend.

Thanks guys

@Vermontstig The three main things you need to do to get rolling with VESC are:

1. Configure your Battery Voltage and Amps
2. Configure your Motor
3. Configure your Remote

These three threads will get you up and running:

Do you have any idea how to configure the Vesc to reverse with the help of the motor itself.  If yes, could you explain exactly how to.
