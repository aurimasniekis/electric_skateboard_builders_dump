The gen2 has this silver stuff under all of this rubber. Was wondering if it was safe to route through it to fit a bigger battery. Don't want to go with a spacer. Want it to be slim.

The silver is aluminum tape to increase antenna reception for the remote. 

The white wires and aquare are a thermistor that monitors pack temperature. 

Iâ€™d add the aluminum tape back after routing.

What happens If I don't add the aluminium tape after routing?

Put the thermistor inside the pack.
