Hi guys have all the parts to my board but can't move the motors from the remote. 

Modded the HK-GT2B for badwolf enclosure. 
And when I use the bind key on the receiver and turn on the remote while pressing the bind button the flashing red LED on the receiver goes stable. However when I power down both and turn on the vesc after removing the bind key it starts to flash red again looking to bind. 


Anybody have a similar experience?

Remove the binding clip right after binding, don't power off.
