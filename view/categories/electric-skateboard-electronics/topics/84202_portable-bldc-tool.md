Hola everyone,

My main PC died few weeks ago and currently I only have the one from the office, with no admin rights to install any software.

Do you know if there is a portable or zipped version of the BLDC tool?? For FOCBOX!

I tried to install if but it got stuck, no errors but I had to reboot the computer every time I tried it :frowning:

Thanks!

Just to clarify, do you want the BLDC tool or the FOCBOX tool?
