"Best" sensored 6374 are the Dark Matter motors

Not the cheapest though because they're really good motors

I use $5 switch from Lowe's :joy:. 1.5 Years later still works great on 12s pulling over 100 Amps. I don't understand the allure of $40 anti-spark switches

Go into any Lowe's and tell them you need this switch. Should be in with the lights/electronics.

For me it's Overion 6374 130Kv 3550W sensored (completly custom from maytech base)
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/dsc_0033l.jpg
Hardly used seens this summer on my Darth Vapor all terrain, all weather, with pretty hight demand from vesc6 and 12s12Ah Graphene pack.
Now got 5 all them :smile: for all my e-MTB, eDirt, esk8 AT I'm building and probably a little e-mtbike coming... :blush:

(The best I try before this, a sensorless one, the Diamond gtx 6374 200kv, maybe a killer with an encodeur ...)
