I know everyone is excited about their [VESCs arriving][1] (and with good reason!) But I've been waiting on [these guys, back in stock][2] after a long shortage. They arrived today! $55 a piece; 245KV. I'll use these on a dual-rear build.

They must have found more old stock to get rid of. Didn't someone state that they were no longer making these and the price was so low because they needed to clear old stock? Glad I got two before they are gone forever!

These new Batch of TACON motors are not from the R-SPEC motor factory @chaka should be able to confirm this as he claims he has been in talks with my factory to get some of their incredibly high quality motors. 

The R-SPEC motors cost me MUCH more per piece then these TACON sell for at retail @chaka could easily confirm this also.

I suggest anyone with these new batch of TACON motors open one up and post some detailed images, I will also do the same with the R-SPEC motors.

Post here a clear photo of the bearings, the windings, the shaft, the magnets, the magnet retainer rings, the colour of the balancing epoxy... etc etc.

I would do the same but if i take apart my R-SPECS they won't go back together the same color. lol

And i would probably get hair in the bearings or something.

Treenutter, you say that you are going to try a dual rear with the tacon 160.
Which truck would fit those monsters in dual rear ? I thought only the 110 would fit a dual rear ...

I think you're right @psychotiller, I think I could cram these on my Paris 195mm in a dual rear config. However, as I think about it more I'm feeling pretty good about my single drive setup and I'm not really sure that the extra cost for dual is worth it.

You will find you absolutely don't need a dual motor set up. These motors are capable of producing amazing amounts of torque.

Ahhh, my build isn't even complete yet, but I may just have to buy one while they're in stock again!

Anyone know if I'd have a problem of slapping a brand new motor on later alongside my existing tacon for a dual drive? Would one being brand new, and one being used cause any problems?

So two Bigfeet will fit for a dual rear setup? Do you need 195mm trucks for that to work, or is 180mm enough?

these are 6364s right? that's the best i can tell from the bobbypartz site. on 180mm trucks, 6355s leave about a 8-10mm gap or so between the motors when using 9mm belts, so you'll probably want the 195mm trucks. That's my best guess without having them in front of me to measure things.

The 295kv, I believe is 54mm in length. This would fit on a 180mm truck dual rear.

http://www.hobbypartz.com/96m607-bigfoot110-5325-295kv.html

Might be much faster, you can set it up on 12/36 or 14/36.

63 refers to the diameter of the can in millimeters while the second number refers to the length.  50mm and 63mm are the standard diameters for e-boards.  I think the next step up would be an 80mm motor which @jaybird used on his 3-Wheeled FrankenBoard.

Has anyone noticed how much smaller the Tacon 160 is compared to the Turnigy SK3 245kv? They are both spec'd as 63mm x 64mm, but the SK3 is about 10mm longer. Anybody know how these motors perform compared to one another?

@Mobutusan I used to have an sk3 213kv, and I do remember it being longer than my new Big Foot 160's even though they supposedly have the same dimensions. I measured the BF 160 with my digital calipers, and it appears to have true dimensions. There is an extra 2mm where the shaft extrudes out a bit on the back side though.

In my experience these motors are very similar in performance, but I have to say that the Tacon definitely feels like it has more torque. This is on 6s.

## \#64 Posted by: Mobutusan Posted at: 2016-02-28T22:25:54.990Z Reads: 163

Interesting. I've heard that these are torquey little motors. 

So, when I turn each motor by hand, I can really feel that the Bigfoot provides a lot more resistance than the SK3. So, even though the magnets appear to be about the same size in both motors, the Bigfoot must have better, stronger magnets. It's amazing to me that the smaller, cheaper motor has such a great track record, and performance. So glad I picked one of these up. Can't wait to actually use it now.

I love the tacon 160 and made these mounts around it. Take them all please..6 or 5 forget. I even have a couple belts and motor pulleys I'll throw in. No wheel pulleys.

These are as tight as possible fixed mounts with 17 motor teeth and intended for the 36 tooth 3Dprint eBay wheel mount by voodobar.  Or u can print it.  

Polyurethane resin carbon and some Kevlar. 

 The mounted bigger silver one is an old mold and gone.  

These sit around and I'll never finish drilling them.  They drill with the motor mount that comes with the tacon 160 and a bearing inside. In the picture.  Tighten up the belt and drill. It's not hard. 
150$ and I'll pay shipping in US. Maybe someone wants to make 5 boards!  I want them out.  I also have a tacon, let's make a deal.  With base plates and bushings and hardware
