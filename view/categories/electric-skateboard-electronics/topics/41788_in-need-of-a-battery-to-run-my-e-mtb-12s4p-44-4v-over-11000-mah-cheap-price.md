Have you considered using Lipos?
A custom battery might be over budget

You would need 4 of them. 
There is another source let me see if I can dig up a link

go with lipos!
hobbyking has quite alot over 6s +10000mah ones.

also, range is a matter of driving style!

Yes, 2 of these would give loads of power and maybe get you close to 20 miles depending on gearing, rider weight and if your climbing steep hills or not

Higher C rating means less voltage sag which increases range

yes i know its just achmed was saying 10000mah on hobbyking but they all have 15c witch is bad

sir, you want to do some math first!
20c x * 10000mah = 200 amps
and thats not even including burst. a single motor wont handle more then 80 amps usualy

## \#24 Posted by: Achmed20 Posted at: 2017-12-24T00:32:22.858Z Reads: 99

since motors usualy dont pull constant 80Ah, its probably still fine.

im running 2 of these (also 2 190kv 6374 motorts)
https://hobbyking.com/de_de/turnigy-graphene-professional-12000mah-6s-15c-lipo-pack-w-xt90.html

also 15C and 30C burst rating. not many hills arround here ^^
so far no problems. also, you can still limit the max amps in your esc.

20c x * 10000mah = 200 amps
[/quote]

This is not reliable math because when it comes to Lipos, the C rating x capacity does not give true discharge capability

Only SMC Lipos state true discharge rates
```

you can set max current (amps) for a motor on your VESC.
considerinng the max amps are only beeing used anyway when startinng from a full stop (and thats also jsut a Burst [a second or so]), youd be fine anyway.

in short: buy lipos :smiley:

neither is the amps rating on a motor. if they have any at all.
my current draw from one motor on my board averages at about ~10A
max is somewhere arround 70Amps which happens for a fraction of a second whenn starting from a full stop

how much range do you get with these at close to max speed?

Your right, I have likewise tested current draw from my battery using an inline meter while riding. 
At 12s I was only drawing 18a going uphill
And only 32a at 6s. 
With a dual setup
Still, higher C ratings are better however there are some high capacity Lipos with lower C ratings that are good like the Tattu 22ah 25C batteries that @PatRocks  uses. Those batteries are beastly but they’re not cheap.

havent done any realy rangetests with my E-MTB yet. still in building phase :)
on the street it should reach arround 25km.
in the woods ... no idea. probably alot less  

also .. you do not want to drive 55kmh on these things. you have to tighten your trucks so much,  that steering would become a real chalange. my personal limit is 35kmh. everything beyond that is way to stressfull for me ;)

speed on its own is a matter of gearing, motors and on an MTB tires as well. 
use this to calculate your speed

Hey, if you still need a battery pack, I have a suggestion for you. The LG HG2 18650(3.7v, 3ah,20amp const.) is up for sale ($4.49) at www.18650batterystore.com (no I am not getting sponsored). 12s4p will be 48 cells, which is only $216. You can solder the connections yourself and find a 12s BMS with the overall cost under $300. A 530wh pack that could bring you 3.5kw const, and 35+miles! Just a suggestions though.
