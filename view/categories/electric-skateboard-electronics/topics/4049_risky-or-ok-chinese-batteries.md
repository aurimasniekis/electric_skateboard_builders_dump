Hey, I am trying to complete my build, and I need to buy the batteries, as you all may know, hobbyking is 75% of the time out of stock or on back order, so I decided to find other alternatives, I looked on other rc websites, amazon, and Ebay. Then on Ebay I found these

http://www.ebay.com/itm/HRB-6S-5000mAh-Lipo-Battery-Pack-22-2v-50C-T-plug-XT60-EC5-Airplanes-USA-ship-/111873533139?hash=item1a0c2ea4d3:g:2uoAAOSwaA5WlgII
 
AND 

http://www.ebay.com/itm/You-Me-6S-5000mAh-Lipo-Battery-Pack-22-2v-50C-Helicopters-Airplanes-RC-Hobby-/111869726836?hash=item1a0bf49074:g:dqcAAOSwaA5WkKwY

And basically those types of Chinese batteries.

Have any of you ever tried these? Do you think they are reliable?

Can't give you advice on the Chinese batteries but 50c is high. You might get away with if you are only using the one battery (not running two in series or parallel) but it could still shorten the life of your long board. 

On loop wrote a good post on c ratings.

@ArmandR to the degree that it's possible, I think you're better off choosing packs that have been tested by the community here already. These don't seem to present any cost savings, so I don't understand why you'd take the risk. There are other vendors that carry tested packs.

@nfed163 is right that the C rating of these is higher than our needs demand, which might explain the high cost. 

I'm not saying that these are guaranteed to be poor quality, just that there are other packs that we've all tried that are less likely to be DOA or otherwise problematic.

Just get this, around the same price and a decent brand. I have put a lot of miles and so have a lot of people on this forum with these batteries. I really doubt you would need a 50C rating, what is your setup you are trying to build?

I've gotten hrb ...

They have gone up in price the past few months .... (The 6000mah was the same if not cheaper than the 5000mah)

Seem to works well... I can get a solid 13 miles with plenty of room to spare on  6s running two 6s 6000mah

Edit: only seem to get slightly warm full blast till the end of my voltage cut off at 3.4v ... If I'm just crusing till the battery cut off..it's not warm at all

same, they're good batteries, one of them I've beaten it a bit and it goes slightly off balance after discharging it but overall it's good, I get 12+ miles with 2x5A 6S

Yeah agree...I just let warm batteries cool before charging...
I like the fact they don't get hot like others I've used
