So I've been using the space cell 10s3p for a couple of days now, and I just got it off the charger. It says it's at 100% but it won't turn the motor. I tried to connect it to my computer to use the BLDC tool, but it won't show up. I connected my setup to a lipo battery I had lying around and it works fine. Not sure what' wrong with the battery.

There is still power to the vesc because the lights are on. I tried to replace it anyways and no difference.

Did you run a motor detection?

can you maybe post vesc data? In particular the voltage? Or if you have a voltmeter that works too.

I second the volt meter - what's the Space cell output measuring at?  At the XT90 plug w/ meter?

I'm going to buy a voltmeter today and i'll check. I left the battery disconnected and on all last night. It still read 100% this morning, but it worked.  Hopefully this doesn't happen again.

Good news, but i wouldn't trust the battery display...  Especially if it reads 100% after being on all night.

Measure it w/ a meter and let us know.  Hopefully you just need to adjust/replace the battery display if that's not working right.

GL!

I think you might have some funky setting in your, if you don't mind posting them just to be sure there is no problem with them ðŸ˜‰
