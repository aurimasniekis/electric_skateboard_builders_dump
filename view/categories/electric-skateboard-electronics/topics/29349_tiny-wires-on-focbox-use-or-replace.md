I have just received two FOCBOX and they look great. I am very excited to use them on my new build. My only concern is the small wires. The xt60 I guess should be fine but the phase wires are tiny compared to what I have always seen and used. Is anyone having problems with these? Should I just replace the connectors to 5.5mm to match my motor?

I'm planning to replace them with 5.5 bullets and 12awg. They come with 14awg and 3.5mm connectors

Glad i'm not the only one concerned with the size. These wires are TINY!

According to @onloop in the Official FOCBOX Thread, The wires are just fine and can handle 60a continuous.

I'm sure they can as one of my builds uses a 14 awg parallel connector. But I'd feel better replacing it myself.

He says changing wires does not affect warranty and if you kill the 14awg wires he will send 12awg. Therefore, I'm just going to change connectors and see what happens!

Yea i'm sure you'll be fine. I think it'd be a bit difficult to solder 14awg wire onto 5.5 bulelts though. You'll need to fill the well with a bunch of solder

Yea that's my concern as well. May have to change the wires to 12awg.

You don't need to, 14awg is more than enough... (and it is probably a Warranty void)

Swapping the wires does technically void your warranty, as any modifications to our product will. Don't worry though - you can always purchase the platinum warranty on the FOCBOX which covers user modifcations too!

Well then... I guess that means I need to figure out how to get 3.5mm connectors on a 12awg motor wire.

I just swapped out the connectors and have been golden since.  However, I do have a little play with my heat shrink.  I might have to go back and add a smaller tube as a buffer.

They are 4mm bullet connector and they should fit perfectly on 12awg wire since 4.0mm is for 12awg and 5.5mm is for 10awg.

Thak you for this! That makes this much more simple if the connectors fit.

They're definitely not 4mm bullets, at least not inside diameter. My 4mm banana plugs aren't even close to fitting.

Yes as @Jinra said, the last batch of FOCBOX does not have 4mm bullet connectors.. O said something in the other thread about it maybe being a mixup with the manufacturer and Pete said that the R2 uses 3.5mm bullets so the new FOCBOX has them.

Well i didn't exactly say the R2 used 3.5mm connectors. I said i wonder if they do. I have no idea what the r2 uses.

Talk about capitalizing on a market! Are there any other motors running 3.5mm connectors? Guess i will just have to throw these motors away and buy a pair of Enertion motors to work with the FOCBOX... NOT! The latest 6374 I got from @JLabs came with 4mm connectors and I thought they were kinda small, although they are doing just fine. However, 3.5mm is a bit small for my comfort.

One thing to notice, XT60 connectors are 3.5mm bullets with a fancy shroud on it.

Test it out, **WITH NO POWER** you will be able to plug the female 3.5mm bullet perfectly in the xt60 male. 3.5mm are perfectly fine.

Changing connectors is a pretty common practice in the diy scene...

Sorry... My Bad ðŸ˜… I got mix up with all those number. But still there is no issue for soldering 12awg wire over 3,5mm bullet...

I assumed he was going to replace his connectors which would mean soldering 5.5mm to 14 awg which he'll need to fill the bullet well a bit with solder to make it work.

This is certainly true and I did plan to replace my connectors. However, I do not want to void the warranty as I plan to run FOC.

I just picked up some wire adaptors. They are sold as "wireless" because there is no wire or soldering just metal bridging the connections. Had to get two sets because I all ready soldered  my wiring with 4mm plugs. Silly me, pretty sure I read that Focbox used 4mm plugs ðŸ˜‹.

Question, if I have insulated copper wire ( strands, not solid) roughly the same thickness as 14awg could I use that? Actual braided wire is hard to find here.

4mm are more than enough. Those ugly 5.5mm connectors are overkill. Just take more space like xt90 which are overkill too.

Why not keep the 3.5 connectors on focbox and just swap the motors down to 3.5? Curious about the reasoning

That's certainly an option depending on your phase wire size. I have 10awg silicon wires so they will not fit in a 3.5mm connector.

You may be fine. When you tin your wires, do it while they are inside the casing. This will tin them in the tightest way possible.

So my motor has 12AWG wire with 5.5mm and the focbox has 12AWG wire with 3.5mm. What is the best solution? I am trying to order the right stuff lol I got 3.5 male and fem bullet connectors around that I can use.

You might as well try the 3.5mm if you have them. No need to order stuff youbdont need.

Why are the connectors 3.5mm? 4mm should be the minimum being that is the minimum size connector you are going to find on motors we use...Skimping on wire size and connectors when everything else is finally better seems counter productive and pointlessly costly to the end user.

hmmm. i've been toying with the idea of dropping from 12 to 14 on the phase leads too. Thing is, they might do the job just as well, but they don't _seem_ as beefy and that perception can be conflated with the totally subjective notion of "cheapness"

To the general consumer if it looks cheap is should be cheap so I agree with you.

I've been running two FOCBOXs with some Ollinboards 5065 Motors. No issues here, though I am only running 25a continuous on the battery side for each ESC. It's a rocket ship for a board tuned under 2kw!

I swapped the 3.5's to 5.5's (looks kinda funny) to match motor.  I only ordered 5.5mm connections so I just figured keep it all the same!  Hopefully it won't come back around and bite me in the ass.
