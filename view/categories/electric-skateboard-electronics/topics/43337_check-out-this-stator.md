I work at a dealership and we're replacing a head on a hybrid car and you can see the stator for the electric motor with the oil pan removed. Impressive.

Im actually going be be purchasing one soon to convert a quad bike into a <a href="http://emrax.com/products/emrax-348/ ">150Kw</a> racing beast. (might actually change the idea to a full on small racer).

the ESC's on them are insane.  need to handle ~100V-500V and ~100-1000A    cant wait to get my hands on some of them!

Yea I'm gonna do a 4wd set up on a mountain board with this set up but I may not be possible cause my deck doesn't have the space for a 500v anti spark switch.

Btw that car is about 11 years old with over 100,000 miles and that stator looks brand new, I guess when it's covered up they never even get dirty.

Why reinvent the electric wheel? Just bolt some bindings to the roof. ðŸŽ¡

Btw, what kind of car is that?
