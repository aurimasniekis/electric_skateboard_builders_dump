What's the best material for making a lid ??? If I remember well Enertion Raptor 1 had problems with lid's made out of Carbon Fiber. I am wondering what's the strongest lightest and thinest material ??

You could use sheet aluminum and have a channel box that runs bottom side laterally.

GF/Fiberglass will work well too.  Lighter than wood and still pretty strong depending on thickness and shape.

I know my marbel board is CF and they have a GF window in them to allow signal through easier.
