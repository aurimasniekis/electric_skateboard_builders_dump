I'm interested to know peoples ride time and what battery they are using.
there is a lot of discussion about distance and speed, but I don't think there has been one about Time.

Please share the approximate* ride time that you get and what battery pack you are using :smile:
I'll start:

I'm using a 6S 5000mAh pack and I get about an hour of ride time.


*obviously this will be different for every one depending on hills and other factors, but I'm interested to know..

I am using 6s 10AH lipo, I got about 2hr ride time if I constantly hold 50% - 80% throttle. This could even be further improved with some kick push and occasional neutraling the throttle position (let it cruise).

On my eMTB I have a 12S 15Ah Lipo and get around 2.5 hr on pavement and 1.5 hr on off road terrain. 

For my vanguard I have a 12S 8Ah Lipo and get around 2 hr ride. 

But mostly I prefer to talk on distance when it comes to battery performance.

That's impressive. I rarely ever got more than an hour  out of my 6S 10ah pack, even at 50%. I've never used a VESC with that pack though. My 6S upgrade will likely consist of VESC and one of those 12Ah graphene packs. 

I get about 90 minutes out of my space cell because i just can't keep it slower than 10 consistently. Here's my last range test with a 1:28:43 run time on it. looking at my averages in the splits you can see i was trying to keep it slow but its hard. lol

Well don't get me wrong completely, I didn't stand on my board for complete 2 hours in total :) but it can reach around 1:45 ish. I ride in Netherlands, we have bike paths which is quite smooth and flat. My weight is also 60kg. Literally kick starting and cruising as much as possible combined with large wheel and ceramic bearings make the difference in time and abit more in distance.

@lowGuido great question! I get about an hour of ride time with 8S 5000mAh. I start with 4.2v and aim to finish with 3.6v or more. I usually stop at about 3.7v or 3.8v.

EDIT: Adding more detail in case @lowGuido decides to use it. Single motor, 4.29:1 gearing, belt driven, mixed terrain (10-15 grade hills and flats), 127mm pneumatic wheels, rider weight is 150 lbs.

I have been using a 750 watt hour pack for quite awhile now and I honestly never even have to think about how much range or time I have left. I don't think I can ever go back to anything less. A big battery makes range or ride time a non issue for most riding.

I have been using 2x 8000 mAh zippy batteries is parallel, giving me 16000 mAh of juice running at 6s. However, it is about a 20 mile range or about 2 hours of ride time. Bear in mind, half of that ride has 15- 20% hills. So I'm sure I could get better if I lived where its flat. But San Francisco is the opposite of flat, lol.

I use a single enertion 6355 motor, and I get about 55 minutes ride time. Only about 5% of the way is uphill. I use 2x 5000 mah 6s batteries which I have connected in parallel for 10000 mah.

 Also I live in Copenhagen, Denmark, most of our roads are really smooth. I weigh 70 kg (154 lbs)

Seeing you guys' ride times, shouldn't I get a bit more? I do ride with 100% throttle (around 17 mph) though most of that time, maybe it has to do with that?

Wether you're connecting in series or parallel for 2x 5000mah it reach the same amount of distance. I also have around 1 hour ride time for 2x 5000mah in series.

[/quote]

thats not correct, if you connect in parallel it will increase the distance, if you connect in series it will not increase the distance, but it will increase the power.

I would expect 10000mAh to go for longer than 1 hour, unless its up hills.

Yes I understand. Practically one increase in speed and one increase in distance. However in overall no matter how you connect them, you end up in same distance travel. Those batteries contains certain level of energy, it doesn't matter the way you use them, it will only contain that much (kwh / energy rated) and doesn't increase by doing different way of connection.

Theoretically:
2 lipo parallel at speed of 10km/h reach 10km distance in 1 hour
2 lipo series at speed of 20km/h reach 10km distance in 30 min
Same distance right? only different in time.

Maybe to get it running for around 3 - 4 hours I should connect 4 of my lipo packs all in parallel, then someone gona try 2s configuration for 8 hours ride time hahaha.

Totally. Some build have different:

- Battery capacity 5000mah / 10000mah / 20000mah
- Longer / shorter cables (cable length has higher resistance)
- Higher density cells / lipo packs (nano tech / graphene / flightmax)
- Battery resistance / C rating / efficiency (higher discharge = less resistance = less heat = more distance)
- More connectors / loose joints / electric switch / breaker (known to consume abit of charge)
- Different receiver / use of BEC for opto ESC
- None / smaller / additional capacitor (higher rated capacitor known to improve efficiency)
- Use of other ESC besides VESC, some ESC use mini fans that draws quite some energy
- Quality of bearings and or wheels size and or wheel durometer
- Quality of wheels (fake vs original)
- Throttle input / motor rpm (some motor runs more efficient in certain rpm for certain amount of load)
- Regenerative braking

Other factors:

- Weight of rider
- Track smoothness
- Total board weight
- Degree of incline
- Temperature (not so significant, but might effect battery capability)

---

Actually this put me in concern about VESC vs normal ESC efficiency (without fan). As VESC use big fat MOSFET while normal ESC spam many small FET. Theoretically this big MOSFET should be more efficient.

Also no one seems to put wheel durometer in consideration. I wonder if I should get 76A / 83A if I want to get longer distance. 76A is softer and it should roll better on rough surface compared to 83A as more bumps create more resistance. But smoother surface 83A would win over roll distance as it remains round almost all the time, in which concerns me back on how rough and how smooth wether to go for 76A / 83A.

@rogerd i understand that there are at least 100 different variables for each build/rider/area but this is a simple set of battery and time figures. 

Oddly enough if you look at all the data. Regardless of all the other variables it all seems to plot quite nicely.

That's the point I guess.

It's your data, but just pointing it out. I'd hazard that someone at 60 kg would get at least 20% more ride time than someone 90kg so if there are big weight differences in your samples then the resulting data is fairly meaningless.

Btw according to my experience guys, having extra capacitor especially really huge one help improve the distance travelled. I can't proof this with great evidence but I have the feeling that I ride for longer distance.

I suspect that the battery and capacitor deliver energy in different way to the VESC and motor. If I open the VESC graph, I always see the motor current is higher than the battery current especially during acceleration.

I am not quite sure if this is correct as watt hours is just watt hours, but I have quite some noticeable difference at the moment.

38mph isn't too fast but I usually top out around 30-32mph on a single drive. Yeah you will lose a little skin if you are not prepared but crashes are much less dramatic than you would think with the proper gear and experience. Shorts under your pants gloves on your hands and a helmet for your face!

Here is the speed and elevation profile from that recording:

That's some good info. I'm still wondering what it's gonna be like when I end up bailing for the first time. I guess I just need to go faster until I get used to it. I've got a full set of knee, elbow, wrist, helmet pads, and decades of tuck and roll experience, so no fear, right? I know when I took off on a powered board for the first time, I felt unbalanced and awkward, and I've been doing all kinds of board sports my whole life. But nothing self powered until now though. It feels perfectly natural now, but I haven't broken 25mph yet, and right now, that feels quite fast. I'm about to go 12s, so lack of speed will soon be a thing of the past, but it's interesting to see you spending a lot of your time between 25-30+mph. I bet the adrenaline starts flowing a bit at those speeds, huh?

Stay within your comfort zone and don't let yourself become too confident. Hitting a stationary object is a big deal at these speeds. But it's a board with wheels and a  motor, I can't imagine anything more obvious and inherently dangerous.

6S Lipo 5A - single motor from enertion, bad hobby esc (waiting for the vesc) that is not really reliable when breaking so I'm rarely topping the speed (~18mph / 28kmh) of my build because I know that car and bikes can break much faster than me 

Max range with these conditions is around 8 miles (13km) draining the battery from 25v to 21v (3.5v per cell), that is around 1h of continuous riding time at those low speeds ( compared to the other guys here ;), I think over 25mph will be scary for me because I know that here drivers don't care much about pedestrians and bikes, they think the road is theirs, I think they care even less about skates ^^ )


First is commuting to an event, speed drops because I'm walking into the underwater tunnel, also they're both door to door logs so the first and last part I'm walking, also I try to not go over 10mph when I'm on busy sidewalks, at least that should increase range

@makevoid can you tell us which Enertion motor and your approx weight
Thanks!

Even at that speed 8 miles on a single 6s 5A is great performance 
Now I'm interested to see a graph of speed vs distance too

The 6372, this one: http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/6374-190kv-electric-skateboard-motor/

I'm ~95kg, I think [this battery](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/XXL-22-2V-5000mAh-50C-6S-6-Cell-Max-55C-LiPo-Battery-22-2-Volt-for/32389994950.html ) I'm using is very good, I got it for 60 usd, I'm waiting for another one to go 10A but it takes 1 month to arrive :no_mouth:

I'll try to make a 8 mile run and post the graph, that app I'm using graphs speed vs distance (graph on the bottom), do you have another app you suggest for android?

Thanks for the info
Wow that's even more impressive for a big guy like me. I weight the same.

As for the graph I meant in general like the one lowGuido is doing for this thread but charting people's speed vs distance ratios. To see if there is a sweet spot for efficency, just curious, you know for science (as LG would say)

Sorry to hear about your long wait, that's the toughest part of this hobby

I didnt think this question was worth a new thread so i want to ask it in here. 

Do you guys see a significant difference between ride time with Lipo and Liion with the exact same spec packs. 

for those of us who use both. 

I feel like my Liion pack drains faster than my lipo.  It might be in my head.. or maybe i just abuse the speed on 10s.

Some angry bike riders on bike lanes sometimes but no majour issues, be careful of cars popping out from intersections,  they don't know that you can't brake as fast as a bike. 

on park paths and in general when riding on sidewalks and in smaller roads there are a lot of cracks and rough asphalt/terrain, because of that I switched recently to bigger wheels and it's slightly better now

the physicist in me is weeping :stuck_out_tongue:

firstly, riding time is a function of battery size, so you would usually swap axes really. and while time is already a nearly pointless measure, mAh is truly pointless. next time please use Wh! no offense meant, I would love statistics about drive train & battery efficiencies, i.e. max range as function of Wh. even that is flawed due to different riding speeds, but everyone can try to be as efficient as possible, i.e. run quite slowly, on flat terrain without much braking & accelerating.

on endless sphere we also had a graph of power consumption as function of velocity - that has been really useful for me to determine what kind of battery current Ill have to expect. so please, more threads like these, but think about the relevant quantities beforehand! :innocent:

common dog fuck maybe, but can you link a graph with range as function of Wh? I havent seen one and it would be great to have, especially with the large enertion forum memberbase. there could be actually some halfway meaningful statistics! would be particularly interesting to compare efficiency of vesc vs other escs, single motor vs dual motor vs hub motor setups. I can tell you are offended, I would be too - but doing things different for the sake of doing it different isnt the best motivation in my eyes. :yum:

Is there some sort of online charting tool where we can add our stats and it will add them to a graph that is then dynamically linked in this thread? So that every change will automatically update the graph in the top post? That would be nice and really helpful for determining the size of your next battery pack.

Check the photo for distance and time stats. I returned home with 18% remaining on the last two batteries.

I carry two extra nanotechs in my napsack so the range is huge at 32km or 20 miles. By then I've had enough. It's a good workout especially after running 5km in the morning.

With this setup it's like hills don't exist. I can start and stop in the middle of any hill I want. It also deserves respect. This is a lot of power and speed.

I'm more inclined to say it should be 18 kilometers. 36v x 5000mah is 180,000 divided by 1000 is 180WH. With only 2P though voltage sag will be a factor. I  would expect maybe 20%+ less as the ballpark cause the batteries will get hot. Other factors come into play as well.

I'm 95kg and use 12wh per km. Seems to work for me. Not too many hills here.

the correct answer is "it depends"
depends on your wheel size.
depends on your wheel compound.
depends on your drive setup.
depends on your gear ratio.
depends on your weight.
depends on how many hills.
