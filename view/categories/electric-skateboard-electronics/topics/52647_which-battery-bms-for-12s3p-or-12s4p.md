I dont think so. Now you have the ability to customize the board to your Needs and build more in the future! that is a huge plus

Dual 6374 is not 2k deep without battery  bro... Were u getting your parts ðŸ¤”
I'd say at most you would spend 1.5k with battery,
A regular 12s4p from Baja or torque boards should be fine being that much of  high amps and never going to use them , just a thought.

If you just want to ride and have fun and occasionally hit 32+ get torque boards battery , If u are a adrenaline junkie and want to ride fast get @barajabali battery pulls more amps because he has a higher amp BMS and you can request it to be bypassed if u choose

u r speed freak ah?, lol with esk8 when u pass 35mph u will starts to feel death. I mean if u can go without speed wabbles before that (do bushing setup before u try) 
baja use 8 giant lithum iron cell which out puts less amp than 30q 12p4s. thats why they use 4 seperate kelly controller. this thing is freaking high off ground without straps no thanks.

and on side note, when u thought it is enough you'd wants more torq more speed in the future

@Hellcat17 - Go with the 12S4P. It's double stacked though to fit within a 26" wheelbase deck. Otherwise, you limit the type of decks that will fit all your components. 12S3P will be discontinued.

Next build I'm going to try and build 4 motors front and rear 6374 with 16/32 gearing with dual 12s2p packs if I like how this setup comes out with a 5 channel Rc car radio and reciever with motor rpm and motor temp and battery voltage and speed connected to BT , I have tons of ideas from my RC car and drone projects not to mention I have a ton of friends in the auto fabrication industry with mig and tig welding experience and CNC lathes ..I'm jumping way ahead here though i need to finish 1 thing at a time here Lmao ðŸ˜‚..Thanks for all the input guys

Hi ! Do you've built a fast sport eSk8 ? Cause I want to build one that can reach 60kph minimum, I can reach 70kph may be more now (because I'm better than last year) on a normal longboard. It is hard to find some example of config on the web... 20kmph is cruising for me... I've tried some normal eSk8.

I just want to say going fast on a car is easy putting your ass  on a stick of wood going 30+mph  with no weight  to back it up you will feel death. It takes skill to ride or stabilize at that speed
