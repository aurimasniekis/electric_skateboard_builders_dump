Hi, has anyone experienced this?
I purchased 2 vescs from diy...
I connected everything and it seemed to work. I connected the vesc to their recommended vesc tool and updated the firmware as the tool suggested. After the update I am unable to accelerate or do anything with the remote. If I use my arrow keys on the keyboard I can control the motors. The remote light says connected but am unable to do anything... 

Anyone have a solution?

Thanks in advance

Sounds like you need to setup your remote again in the PPM tab of Vesc Tool.
