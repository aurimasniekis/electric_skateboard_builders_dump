hi there,

can someone tell why using a 18650 pack is so much prefered over a lets say zippy LiPo Packs?
they all seem to have the same specs and im kinda sure that the space they need is also the same.

edit:
nevermind ... found my answer allready ^^

Thats a real good question and there are a lot of different opinions.
Here are a few facts about the two.
Matching cell to cell, Lipos have much higher discharge rate than Li-ions.
Therefore, in order to equal the discharge capability of a Lipo pack, the Li-ion pack would have to have multiple cells in parallel making it  larger and consequently heavier.
Li-ion cells can discharge lower than Lipo cells.
Example:
10-Lipo cells/5000mah 60C in series = 10s/ 5ah/ 300a discharge
30-25R Li-ion cells= 10s3p= 10s/ 7.5ah/ 60a discharge
```

Hey @Namasaki is it possible for a li-ion to have a 'c' rating as with lipos so they discharge at 'x' times the capacity or is it only possible to increase the capacity (and available discharge rate) with parallel cells?  

...this would explain some of the crazy 12s7p configurations I've seen!! :smile:

```
Li-ions are discharge rated differently than Lipos.
Lipos use the C rating
Li-ions have a set max current and capacity per cell like 
Samsung 25R are  2500mah with 20a discharge per cell.
A 60C Lipo with 2500mah would be 150a discharge per cell

I guess that you could say the 25R is a 8C battery but they are not normally referred to that way.

Don't forget that there are pro's and cons of each, I myself prefer LiPo's like Namasaki, but it's all about what you want from your battery.
I've found Li-Ion's are more expensive and require more work and (ideally) a spot-welder, but they reward you with a lot more re-charge cycles.
Ease of use and price swung me over to the LiPo camp.

I would say that Lipos are a good choice if you need a lot of power in a small, low cost and light weight package.
Li-ions are a good choice if you have plenty of room for them and don't mind the added weight and cost.
Note: the added cost of Li-ions is not only the cost of cells but also manufacturing cost.
Either having someone build it or buying the proper equipment to build it yourself.
Proper equipment means at least a 60a spot welder. The 30a welders will not cut it.
Believe me, I tried both. The 30a just kept tripping the breaker. The 60a worked but I had to set it on full power & 8 pulses to get a solid weld nugget.

Well said @riva_00

I started with Lipos then switched to Li-ions and then back to Lipos.
My reason for going back to Lipos was the ability to have a lot of power in a small light package. 
I feel that low cost and ease of maintenance and replacement makes up for reduced longevity.

Like @Namasaki I have run both li-ion and lipo in multiple configurations.  My personal opinion is...

10s3p made with 25R cells is ok, but there's not enough available amps and the sag is killer for me.   

10s3p made with 30Q cells is great, lots of amps and lots if discharge (said travel time).

Lipo 6s made with x2 Zippys is ok, decent amps but not a lot of too speed.  Very cheap as you don't need a bms, you can use a 30 bucks hobby charger.  

10s lipo made with x5 2s Zippys is pretty hard to beat, lots of amps and lots of travel time and no sag. Either charge individually, which is a pain in the ass, ot use a BMS which is easy. 

Li-ion packs are good for 500-1000 charge cycles,  Lipo packs are good for 200-500 charge cycles...bith depending on well you treat them.  

Given the choice I would use a 10s3p or 4p pack made with 30Q cells but a 10s lipo pack performs just as good, probably better, but doesn't offer a ton of charge cycles.  I build a lot of boards, for a guy that doesn't cell powered boards, so I use a lot of lipo packs because of cost.

I don't understand this statement, 25R's are rated for 20A continuous discharge while 30Q's are rated for 15A. It'd make sense for the 30Q's to sag more so than the 25R's

I don't really understand it myself, ask @PXSS for specific.  What I know from use is that a 10s3p with 25r's will barely hit 15 mph and won't do anything from a full stop on my RE/PT'ile  board...this is with 6x2 AT wheels.  The 10s3p with 30q's never sags, has a ton of drive time performance is awesome.

Hm, I'll have to give 30Q's a try on my next build. My current 10s4p on 25R's seem okay in terms of sag. Only goes down by about 5-7% during hard uphill/wind.

I was amazed when I first Rose a 30Q pack, I was really amazed when I put my AT build in the grass and still didn't feel any sag.  Going up a 15 deg hill I say 1v.  They are a little expensive but for a primary pack it's well worth the money.  

I still have a 6s lipo pack on my beater board and I have 2 10s lipo packs I swap out in another board that is still in testing.  I gave the board with 10s3p with 25r's to my son because he only weighs 125 so it doesn't sag much in him and he tops at 15mph because I configured the VESCs with that limit.

Took some screenshots from the datasheet of each cell. The sag seems pretty similar in the beginning with both 25R and 30Q hitting 3.6v @ 200mah under 20A discharge, but as the cell depletes we hit 3.1v @ 2A under 20A discharge for the 25R and 3.15v~ @ 2A under 20A discharge for the 30Q. At the tail end the difference gets even more dramatic at 2.6v~ @ 2.5A under 20A discharge for the 25R and 2.85v @ 2.5A under 20A discharge.

While your claims of less sag on the 30Q seem to be true, they may be a bit overstated.

Easier to read version (all 20A discharge):
**25R:**
* 200mah - 3.6v
* 2000mah - 3.1v
* 2500mah - 2.6v

**30Q:**
* 200mah - 3.6v
* 2000mah - 3.15v
* 2500mah - 2.85v

I'm just saying it's a possibility that another factor is accounting for your large sag on 25R's, perhaps a broken weld, or bad cell in a parallel group. Just 1 bad cell can cut your discharge potential by a lot.

Could it be that the 25R's are overrated?
Could it be that the 30Q's are underrated? 

And here is some shocking news that I found concerning 25R's

All if my packs are fine.  I typically balance charge so I can see the voltage drift per cell.  I always check each cell at least once a week. I test the resistance if my lipo cells every week.  I keep logs via the @Ackmaniac Android app on all of my boards.

@namasaki is your li-ion experience only with basen cells?

Also c ratings are numbers pulled from thin air, there is no standard way of measuring c ratings. Lipos are overrated in their specs, especially hobbyking, still more discharge than li-ion of course. 18650s weight less per capacity and with enough parallel cells have decent discharge. 18650 cells are probably the best for cruising and getting max range. Lipos are better for performance and can pull lots of amps. So that being said I might go back to lipos (from 25r's) because I pull 80 amps on very hard accelerations and don't need capacity as much as I need amps. Or I might switch to 30q cells or 20700a cells

True my only experience with Li-ions was with Basen 4500 cells which claimed 40a continuous per cell.
Maybe they where overrated. They got good range going slow on flat ground but lost more than half that range charging up hills.  Maybe 25R's are overrated as well.
All I know is that my 5ah 60C Lipos have as much range or more on hills as my 9ah Li-ion pack did with a lot less voltage sag and the Lipo pack is smaller and lighter.

Do you have some basis for this claim?
If so, I would really like to see it.
Some may be overrated as some Li-ions are but it seems they must have some way of determining C rating besides "pulling it out of thin air"

Anyway, I have personally compared 5ah 25C Lipos in a 12s config with 5ah 60C Lipos in a 10s config.
The 10s 60C lipo pack had much less voltage sag and just as much range even though the 12s config had more watt hours.

Glad to see more discusion here about lipos. I think they've had a really bad rep when in reality, I think they are just more designed for our application.

With Li-ion, I lose a lot of top speed and performance fast after they are 40% discharged, because the voltage drops. With lipos, they stay a higher voltage for longer.

On top of that, they are cheaper in the short run, which means if you overcharge them or over discharge them, they are cheaper to replace also (which I have a habit of doing, lol).

12s with lipos give me the best performance for the entire ride. I am waiting though for the next gen of battery tech though.

This is pretty typical and is better than lipos IIRC. Keep in mind this measurement is measured with full charge/discharge cycles from 4.2v to 2.5v, which is way below what we typically discharge to. Also, with every .1v we cut short from max charge we also double the cycle life of the cell.

I find it hard to believe that under charging 1/10 of a volt will double the number of full charge cycles in the life of a lithium battery. 
Has anyone here actually proven this theory.
I have been using my Lipos and fully charging them for about 8 months now and I wish I would have kept a log of charge cycles. I honestly can't even guess how many times I've charged them.
I do know that if you fully charge your lithium battery and only discharge it to half empty and them recharge it. that only counts as 1/2 of a charge cycle off the life of the battery.

It's been repeated a lot through various videos I've seen and has its own spot on battery university.

http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries

> Table 4: Discharge cycles and capacity as a function of charge voltage limit. Every 0.10V drop below 4.20V/cell doubles the cycle but holds less capacity. Raising the voltage above 4.20V/cell would shorten the life.

Basen is not a good representation of li-ion as they are not made by a trusted battery company

What I mean for lipos is there is no standard on how to calculate c ratings. Any company can claim what they like. They can claim 100c and still use 12awg wire and 60amp rated connectors. If you get lipos of the same specs from different manufacturers they will perform differently. Your example imo shows this as the 12s pack would be 125amps, Im pretty sure you're not pulling close to that many amps continually. I like lipos, just don't believe their ratings. My main concern with lipos is they're more sensitive and risky over 18650 li-ions.

I think the biggest problem with them is that it would take too many of them in parallel to substantially reduce voltage sag in situations that require heavy current draw.
in milder situations they performed just fine with excellent range. 
I went 28 miles on a 10s2p pack with Basen black 4500 cells just cruising on flat ground.
From what I've heard they may be better than Samsung 25R's

Lipos or Li-ions,  I think it comes down to a matter of choice that depends on individual needs.
For some Lipos are the best fit,  For others, Li-ons are the best fit.

There lots of factors to consider. Basen weigh just over twice as much as 18650 according to specs. So less capacity per weight. According to mooch testing there is also more amps available with something like 30q cells per weight.

I'm not hating on lipos. I might use them for my next board if I can find the right size packs from good manufacturer for my enclosure. What I don't like is the c rating. It's not accurate so it's not useful for comparing packs between manufacturers. Also my experience with turingy 60c is I puffed them first couple of days. So no hobbyking lipos for me

I didn't realize that the Basens weight twice as much as the  Samsung 18650s seems odd since they're only 1/4" larger in diameter and the same length.
They do have 1 1/2 times the capacity as 30Q and almost twice the capacity of 25Rs. Just their discharge rate is overstated like 25R's
Don't know why your Turnigy 60C's puffed in 2 days. Mine have been going for 8 months with no issues.
Isn't Hobby King just a retailer? A pretty large one at that, They obviously aren't going to test every Lipo pack they get from the manufacturers. So I always check them as soon as they arrive and before putting them in use.
I did get a couple bad Zippy packs from them once but they replaced them promptly.

i use samsung li-ion 18650s. 12S at 4P and 5P, both 25R and 30Q cells. I leave that choice to the buyer but honestly i can't tell the difference on the street. My boards use a 60 amp BMS and burn urethane on launch. Even kegals, as sticky as they are, lose traction when i hit the throttle hard enough. 

lion 18650s  last longer. They're safer. They don't puff, they just vent. They seem to be able to completely fail within their own p group and not take the rest of the cells with them somehow. I've had multiple occasions where a dead p group was reading less than a volt and nothing dangerous was happening. They're less puncture prone, far more configurable as far as shaping the over all pack, and store more easily for the same reason. 

trying to find prismatic cells that fit every application as far as shape and size goes is annoying as fuck. 

Also C ratings are distorted at best and grossly exaggerated to the point of fraud at worst, even from reputable sources. 

Lipos are cheaper, that's thier only real advantage other than power density per cell, which can be had with any prismatic. Their cycle life sucks and they come in awkward sizes that don't allow me to get as much juice in the same space. 

but they're pretty much perfect for DIY and hobby boards that you don't have to ship to customers and support over the long term.

If you compare cell to cell it's not the whole story. According to specs a 10s2p (20cell) basen pack will weigh as much as a 44 cell 11s4p 18650 pack. (Not including wire weight)

I did test the turnigy. Don't remember ir but it wasn't to high and capacity was not accurate to usable voltage. My point is hobbyking lipos imo are not the best, i personally like gens ace. 

But thats the problem with lipos, there are just too many to choose from and there is no standard unit of measure. Lipo manufacturers lie. Just try pulling 300amps from your pack continually. Also feel hobbyking lipos give lipos a bad name. I want to see more discharge graphs with lipos across different brands. The community seems to always compare cheaper lipos to 18650s, I want to see other high end lipo packs into the mix. It's hard to know whats a good lipo tbh, I'm not 100 percent sure either, I just know it's not hobbyking.

@longhairedboy do you monitor your rides with something like ackmaniacs firmware and phone app to know things like voltage sag and amp draw? And what brand lipos are you talking about?

I have not used Gens Ace but have heard that they are good quality. 
I have used Venom Lipos and they performed very well but they are very expensive. 
Now that I think about it, a 300/600 amp rating is rather ridiculous, especially considering that the wires coming out of the battery are rated for 75a. 
I do think that C ratings can be used as a relative guide for Lipos of same brand or similar quality.
I wouldn't expect a turnigy 60c to be equal with a Gens Ace 60c or a Venom 60c
I think it reasonable to say that if your going to use Lipos, get the highest C rating possible for the best results.

@Jinra 
There's plenty of threads where I've detailed the difference between 25Rs and 30Qs. 30Q cells are far superior than both 25R and Basen cells. GA cells by Panasonic rated at 10A sag slightly less than 25Rs and have 40% more capacity.  The ratings take a lot more than just ability to deliver power, like life cycle expectancy so you can't just take that number. 

Lipos are cheap. That's their main advantage. A 4P 30Qs provide plenty of power for a mtb imo so the extra power gain from Lipos is useless and the capacity density is not worth it imo.

[/quote]

i have in the past enough to know that 60 amps is plenty and 99% of the time you'll never see it unless you're deliberately trying to get there. Casual riding won't ever see that and hard hot dogging might once in a while, racing and bombing uphill may see it more often. To make my point, my BMSs are supposed to trip if held over 60amps for a small period of time and they don't. Ever. 

I have a 12S4P with dual 6355s on a 16/32 ratio on kegels. With proper vesc settings I got on it full throttle from dead standstill with enough force to put your face onto the back of your head on no more than 57 amps total between both motors. Also my motors are rated somewhere around 3000 watts but i've never seen more than 1200 watts go into either of them. 

doing that on a half charged pack like that might get you 2%-3% sag on the volt meter. the worst case of voltage sag i've ever seen on one of my packs was 12% and it had broken welds. 

12-20% is apparently common and somewhat forgivable on an Evolve Bamboo GT for some fucking reason. I had one in my shop that below 40% would sag down to as low as 25% when you tried to take off. 

I'm moving to 5P packs as they virtually eliminate voltage sag. 6P sag doesn't seem to happen at all but i'm not going to start building hollow core decks.  

over build and the components will last longer because they stay cool and comfortable while still putting a smile on your face.

I do a lot of bombing up hills which is one of the main reasons I use Lipos.

I pull a amp or two shy of 80 amps on acceleration and over 3000 watts combined. Basically hooked from racing my friend and now that's just how I ride for fun. I have a 11s4p pack and it's pretty good for cruising but now I need more amps/less voltage sag

@pxss power gain from lipos is useless, 4p 18650 pack is enough for mtb? Try explaining that to @nowind . Imo lipos are the obvious choice for a small powerful pack. 18650 in a big enough parallel​ pack is the best choice. The question is how big(and heavy), is big enough. Pxss if a 11s4p 25r battery sags 5v, how much voltage sag can we expect if the cells where 30q -asking for a friend lol

Another data point that pretty much matches your statement.

12s4p 25r single 6374 16/36

Steep hill climb at 25mph (top speed on this setup is around 27-28)

VESC 4 got to 80c at the top, at a little over a minute.

Pretty steady draw of 35-40a and 1200w over about a minute, with a peak of 48a and 1700w lasting about 2 seconds.  3v to 3.5v sag.

You also have to keep in mind that rider weight is a big factor. If you put 10kg more on the board, you´ll experience a good amount of more power needed. So a 60kg rider might never reach 60A constant up hill, while my fat 90kg ass (+backpack, helmet and stuff) will easily go over that :slight_smile:

[/quote]

IMO yes, it is. 30Q cells can draw up to 30A continuously as long as you keep them under 80C. 4*30 = 120A. That is more than plenty for almost everything. A 10S lipo of **similar** size would have 5000mAh and you would be drawing 24C at that point. If you need more power then a 6P can provide up to 180A and still be smaller than a Lipo. Anything above that, go with a Lipo. Again, unless you are bombing uphill as @Namasaki does or have other extreme circumstances, 30Qs are better. 

[quote="Titoxd10001, post:43, topic:24079"]

[/quote]

Drawing 80A from a 11S4P 25R should sag it 6.6V at 50% capacity from 39.6V to 33V while the 30Q sags 4.4V from 40.5V to 36.1V at the same capacity. This translates to **9.3% more power and 33.3% less heat produced**

This is very very true. That's why i base my performance specs on a 150-160 pound rider and say that up front. Then tune the vescs to not pull more than the BMS can handle and what ends up happening is the board just kind of gets slower as the rider weight increases, which from a layman's perspective would seem to make the most sense. Tripping the BMS obviously isn't something you want happening. 

we keep creeping up on motor amps and pulley ratios trying to see exactly what we can get out of 12S 60 amp BMSs. 

Also i have 13S BMSs and extra cells and a 13S charger. Soon Ru (review unit, my yellow board) is going to either go faster or smoke the FOCBOXES in there. I feel pretty confident that a FOCBOX can handle 13S if the settings are right without exploding too much. I'm going to do it for science regardless of this project's obvious "hold my beer" flavor. People have told me it won't. I never listen. I do what i want.

its all about use cases. If i was bare bones racing regularly i'd be on lipos and i'd probably have a way of swapping packs that didn't involve dropping the box. Lipos really are a solid option for enthusists who love to tinker because they are lighter and smaller and less expensive but also have less cycle life so they need more attention.

Guys thank you about the Samsung 30Q discovery, I did know about HG2 in 3000mAh but 30Q is a good alternative from 25R.

I mean, never looked at its discharge ratings and temp !

I'm getting a 12s7p and by every stardard I know, the only 'bad' thing about the pack is the weight 😂

Can you be a little more descriptive?

Maybe he's used to big power ? 

That's a 140A / 6000w pack tho so I don't know either :sweat_smile: Sounds powerful to me and big range too !

@Achmed20 - Great Question.  And, Great answers.  

I personally stay with the LiPo's because I want to travel with my board. 

Airlines restrict lithium batteries by wattage, and by the pack.  Now - every airline may very a little in their policy(check with your airline), but for the most part (In the US), batteries are limited to 100 watts, "carry on only", 2 extra batteries. That means - I can take my 5s (18.5v nominal x 5ah = 92.5w) batteries along with me on my trips.  

Note: NEVER allow your lithium batteries in the cargo hold of an aircraft.  It's illegal in most countries, and you could find yourself in a lot of trouble.  Its our responsibility to know the rules.  Yes, Li batteries are shipped NEW from china in a cargo aircraft - that is different.

Second NOTE: Airport security in most countries do not hire the most Li friendly and knowledgeable folks.  Therefor, just because you say the battery is legal to carry on an airplane does not mean they will let it through.  If the battery does not clearly say the Wattage on the battery - they probably wont let it through.  Some LiPo's say the wattage on the battery, some don't.

If anyone has had experience with this, please share :slight_smile:

Couple of guys have made or are using kinda like 10/12S-1P packs in parallel and haven't had any fuss in the check-in so far. Can't find the thread it was on tho  
  
Also the quite short paragraph about batteries onboard airplanes has still room to specially state that no DIY batteries are allowed,  but if you can make it look legit and can spill all kinds of convincing technical jargon at the clipboard warrior looking at it I bet you have faar bigger chances of getting a pass. Also to use all these kinda LiPo 'fireproof' bags and maybe even a small carry-on case for them (?)

I'm also in the process of trying to come up with a universal( read: does everything, but half-assedly;) ) build or something along the idea
![image|690x422](upload://au7EcfAxYr0rFwPQyIfWoXk57zn.png)  
  
Also, I'm still afraid of that happening to a lipo pack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JECJAgRsp-4 tho it's more like phobia unless I'd pinch a penny and'd go for the dirt-cheap factory  third shift's backdoor lipos from taobao and the likes

Well most of the specs that are described in the picture are in some form still in the build (theoretically all Ok but lots of practical testing still to be made) but there are many loose ends still. Kinda apples vs oranges situations:P Tho the batteries are done (theoretically) I'm taking it slowly and holistically - pretty common to be hyper about one idea on one day only to find out how unrealistic and -practial it acctually is later on)  
  
this is the M1:1 size drawup with notes and details of the 'deattachable' middle section, but still very WIP. I'll give a holistic review some time again just to see if anything pop ups again  
  
![image|663x500](upload://b0qgCDUmIhBQmohvR4rwcyhAuh2.jpeg)   

Also the molds for everything have been cut, just need to finish, assemble and prepare.. the whole house is full overgrown bush of work that would badly need trimming a bit x0

Ahh yes I'm still convinced strenght wouldn't be an issue as there's pretty big bending momentum on all the joints due to 20mm thickness. I will also be using heavy unidirectional, medium bi directional and lightweight bidirectional glass reinforcements only. Also very easy to add material later on tho it's still unknown
