It'd probably be cheaper to just buy them yourself...

You're talking about a series connector, right? Or a balance board?

oh like a laptop charger? You can still charge them up at the same time (in parallel)

if you have the proper charger, you can still charge in series using balance leads

yeah just get a 2x3s -> 6s balance lead adapter, plug that adapter into your imax b6 along with the 6s battery.
