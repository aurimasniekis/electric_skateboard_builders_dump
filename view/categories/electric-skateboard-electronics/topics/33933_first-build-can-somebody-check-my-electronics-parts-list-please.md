Hi, 
I'm working on my first build, just hoping for some input on this parts list for the electronics:
Battery: Turnigy 4500mAh 6S 30C Lipo Pack https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-4500mah-6s-30c-lipo-pack.html
ESC: HobbyKingÂ® â„¢ X-Car Beast Series ESC 1:8 Scale 120A https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tm-x-car-beast-series-esc-1-8-scale-120a.html
Motor: KEDA 63-64 190KV Brushless Outrunner 10S 2000W https://hobbyking.com/en_us/kd-53-30-high-voltage-brushless-outrunner-190kv.html
Transmitter: GT2B

I'm not after huge speed or anything. Will this blow up or anything? I'm normally pretty good with electronics but I thought getting opinions from those with experience in this particular application would be wise. Can I run the receiver off the BEC built into the X-car?

Many thanks,
R

190kv at 6s will be slow and not at all torquey. Find a motor with atleast 245kv (I highly recommend the Tacon 245kv motor for 6s)

Also, what are you doing for the mechanical side of things?  Motor mount, enclousure, pulleys, wheels, board, trucks

If i was you i would spend 10dollars more for the remote and hope for the best and buy a winning remote.

Why???? GT2Bâ€™s are crazy reliable and cheaper

I also think the mini remote from @JLabs is supposed to be rock solid and is only $30

How come the higher kv gives better torque? 
For the mechanical side I am using an alien power systems motor mount with the 15mm pulleys from an ebay kit. Using Paris trucks and 83mm flywheel clones. I'm not sure how I'm going to make the enclosure yet, I'll probably vacuum form something until I sort a better solution. 
Thanks for the advice :)

Is that for the smaller form factor? I was planning on making a mod for the GT2B to make it more convenient but if there's another reason to use an alternative then I will need to do more research :slight_smile:
Thanks

Lower kV motors only have more torque when you run at a higher voltage, 245-270kv will be good at 6s.  190kv is good at 10-12s

Ok, thanks, I'll look for a higher Kv motor. Is it better to go for 245 kV or 270 kV if I want high torque and efficiency rather than speed?

Yes, that is what I was planning on getting

245 will give more torque than 270.

That kit sucks. I bought it and was thinking i'd safe a lot of money, but i ended up buying everything twice cause it didn't work well. Worst part is that the pulleys and belts are HTD3 which have far smaller teeth than HTD5, so if you accelerate or break hard, the belt will slip a lot. Also the motor mount didn't hold well on my trucks at all. I ended up getting pulleys, belt and motor mount from @esk8 Far more expensive but it makes all of the difference.

You could always buy a mount from me ðŸ˜‰

Thanks for the warning! I'll look for an alternative source for the pulleys.

I already have a motor mount for this one I'm afraid, but I'll definitely keep you in mind when I look for parts for future builds.

My friend bought this kit and i installed it. it feels rock solid; http://www.ebay.com/itm/DIY-Electric-Skateboard-ABEC-Flywheel-Pulley-Kit-15mm-Wide-Belts-/272850639792?epid=4004135732&hash=item3f872a5bb0:g:2kwAAOSw44BYl4XF
there are other kits that use the exact same image but ive heard they are very low quality

15/36 gear ratio
