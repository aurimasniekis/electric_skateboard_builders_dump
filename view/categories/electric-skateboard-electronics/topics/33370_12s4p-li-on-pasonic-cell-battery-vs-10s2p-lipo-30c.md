I’m looking at buying TB 12s4p. I’m currently running 2 turnigy 5s 5000mah lipos in series and have 2 sets. I have TB vesc and a single motor TB 190kv setup. I have 90 and 97mm wheels. I currently hit about 30-31mph with the 97’s and 28mph with the 90’s. I get about 4-6 miles per pack. 

My question is can the single motor handle a 12s setup and how much more distance would I get? I have an Evolve Bamboo GT and would like it to either keep up or go a lot further in one ride. Then my last question would be, how much faster would my board be. 34+ mph??? I know a dual setup would be ideal but I’m in orlando and literally have zero hills. 

Thanks

Also my hearing is 36t/16t, with 12mm belts. I was looking into 15mm but saw they have a lot of drag? Would a 18t put to much stress on the belt as well? 

Any help is appreciated!

for the belt i would go with 15mm.  12mm can cuz slip and i tighten the tension to solve this but this not only ate through 3 belts and also makes more drag. 15mm actually gives u less drag at the end.

Hi, I'm using a TB 12s4p pack with dual 6355 190kv. I've never ridden it until cut off but during those test that I took I was able to reach 25 miles range without a problem. I assume if you're using single you will get more range (+3 to 5 miles?). In terms of max speed honestly I was to scare to push it to the limit, therefore I can't tell you how fast it is. Hope it helps

I'm using TB's 12s4p pack with a single 6355. I can say that I've also never run it to zero, but have done 15 miles and have had more than 75% left on the meter. Running a 13:36 ratio with shaven MBS's (around 95mm). Also never hit top speed as my trucks are geared towards riding in the city and taking sharp corners. Usually don't go over 22mph for sake of speed wobbles.

What kind of cells are you using, how much mah are in each cell? Use a Wh calculator to calculate the Wh and approx. 10wh = 1km. And with your 12s setup ,34+mph without hills seems like a reasonable top speed with your 97s.

Ok so the 12s4p pack will give me a lot more speed which is great. Would a 15mm belt give me better breaking? I weigh about 195lbs

yes a 15mm belt would help, but with a single motor, you're still going to have belt slippage on hard braking, and it goes without saying that you'll definitely not be able to come to a full stop on even small hills.

@ cwazy1
I just built a 10S4P pack with TESLA cells from a 90D module.
These are the NCA chemistry, similar to the Sanyo NCR1865GA (10A constant, 20A burst for 30 sec) cell.
What are the cells you are using in your pack?

Mine are Panasonic NCR18650PF 2900mAh cells. Your cells' specs look great. If I were to do it again, I'd also shoot for a 3500+mAh.

@cwazy1  

Be really careful when purchasing TESLA cells, there are a lot of people selling laptop batteries with the wrapper removed.
There is only 4 ways to verify that it is a genuine TESLA cell:
1. There is a single, distinct weld on the center top and bottom of the can where a fusible wire was ultrasonic welded.
2. TESLA uses a distinct, proprietary + 
3. TESLA cells have a distinct can bottom.
4. The manufacturing QR code on the can is always in the same spot, same code if the cells are from the same module.
(can supply pictures if necessary) 

Also, there are 2 18650 cells offered, from the 85D and 90D.
The 85D has the 3450mAh cell
The 90D has the 3550mAh cell.
Dont be sold the cells from the 85 when paying for the 90's, request a picture of the TESLA battery pod that was dismantled for the cells.

Now TESLA has the 21700's, these are the next gen cell, but for the cost, Prismatic Cells may be the better route to take when considering the total amount of the build. Even though the cost is 20-30% higher, there is also the 20-30% increase in performance you get from the Prismatic Cell.

I weigh just over 200 lbs and had single motor drive(6374) which was 12mm. I could start and stop everywhere without the belt skipping once. This was with htd5 belts, 15/36 teeth.
To say that a single 15mm belt drive will skip and won't stop you on a hill isn't true.
You may find that a single wheel will break traction but this isn't the same thing.

I can't attest to 6374's or for 15t motor pulley, but I'm 160 pounds, running a 12s battery on 6355 on a 13:36 with 12mm belt. Motor min is -50a and battery min is -14a. I tightened my belt as much as I could with the belt on and using my arm to pull the belt as tight as I could while I set one motor screw. This results in about 5mm of play in one side of the belt.

I definitely cannot come to a **dead stop** using purely the motor braking. And I can definitely skip teeth (probably on the motor pulley side) if I brake extremely hard.

Ummmm .... Not to good for the bearing me thinks.

I’ve never experienced belt slippage on my single 6364 15mm belt 15t to 36t htd5.  I can brake without any slippage and can come to a complete stop going downhill

Coming to a stop downhill is not a matter of belt slippage but the size of your motor. A smaller motor is going to struggle stopping you the same as when moving you. A larger motor is going to stop you easier. The only other reason would be if your belt is actually slipping while you are trying to stop on a hill but I'm not sure you are talking about that
