The best app I've found is the Strava app, it gives the speeds and elevations over distance, but it isn't accurate enough for calculating the torque and it doesn't display over time.  BTW I need it to be iOS compatible and a standalone app, I'd rather not have to buy extra hardware

METR is really your only option kind of there's also
