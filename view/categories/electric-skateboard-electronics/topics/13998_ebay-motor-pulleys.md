Hi there! 

I couldn't get my enertion pulley of my motor, so I destroyed it to get it off. Needed get it off because i needed to weld my motor mount to truck. Mount was handmade and my trucks got terrible shape to fit it good on. So If i reorder from enertion just one pulley + shipping it will be 79$, OMG!!! So i find on ebay 
http://www.ebay.com/itm/142103992126?_trksid=p2060353.m1438.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT

 Is it will be good or i'm totally f**ked? i have 12mm belt, but pulley is 16mm, also enertion one is from steel, but this made from aluminum. Does it change something, i mean size for my case and material it's made of?

Is your wheel pulley 12mm? If it is and also has flanges you will probably be ok. If it doesn't and you dont get your mount perfectly straight your belt will travel off of the wheel pulley.

I've used these before, there is no keyway though. Loctite 609 or similar

Should be fine, I have used these before with same caveats as noted above i.e. Steel over soft aluminum but ok, 12mm to 12mm true mount, no keyway so file motor shaft for grubs and loctite A-OK

I have just noticed this post. I bought 2 of them for 7 euros shipping included. Making a keyway was a 5 minutes job.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/4/a4d55109fd868d9fe093941484a60ffbea042b38.jpg" width="281" height="500">

I ordered a few of those to try out.  shipping took a few weeks. If you want one just let me know.

they come with 3 set screws and a tool. the set screws are at 90 degrees.

I might just have to try this out. What type of saw is that exactly? I am using these types of pulleys on my CGT and it has held up so far.

It is called "coping saw" and it is used by jewellers.

Since my motor don't have keyway, I'll be using just set screws. Will it hold? Also how do you take them off your motor when needed, when you have  it hammered down with keyway?

I used same pulley but with 10mm shaft and using the grub screws haven't even used loctitte and if works fine but to be safe would add some.

Stuff sets like stone, be sure not to get any in the motor bearings.

Yeah, i have it! That was the reason to not get off my pulley, it was holding with one 3mm set screw. So when i tried to open with allen key, it was impossible, even with heat. So head of allen key as well as set screw was broken. So tried to drill it out, even then i couldn't get it off, so last thing i took flex tool. And my loved enertion pulley was gone. Now i need to spend 79$ if want new one! Aluminum will be o.k. for some time, i believe that i'll need to change them every 250 km or so, because it's soft material. Also issue is that it's 16mm, my belt and wheel pulley is 12mm, so belt will be traveling sideways:(

The grub screws that came with my ebay pulleys were short. They work but I wanted it to catch more threads.  I used way longer screws plus loctite, zero problems till today.

Yaeh! I noticed that set screws for those ebay pulleys are way too short. What is your belt width?

Mine were perfect but with mine being 10mm shaft I'm guessing they are using the same screws from the 8mm to the 10mm.

If you have to remove the pulley dont use loctitte (to remove it you will have to put some stress on the axle, thus to the motor; it can be both mechanical stress like hammering it or thermal shock like using dry ice)
A clamping system made of 2 screws (this system is meant for 3d printers)is not quite effective as a keyway system( a keyway lets you spread the force over 27mm2 surface, if you use a 18mm pulley).

One half way between the screw system and the keyway system would be the following: you will have to fasten the screw down into the keyway of the axle. 

Pros of this alternative: much more clamping force than the only-screw system

Cons: 1)you will probably wear off the keyway in the long term.
2)this is not as effective as a key system.
