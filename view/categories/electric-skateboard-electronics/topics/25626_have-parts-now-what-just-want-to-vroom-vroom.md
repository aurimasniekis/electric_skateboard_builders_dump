Who can mentor me or link me to how to make this electronic stuff take me down the road? Hopefully battery will be delivered within next week. Thanks so much. 

Writing from cell and so hopefully images attach properly.

@eboosted Is your fuse to ensure that there is an amp limit and if it goes over will it break?

Yes, well in fact, I included the fuse on the diagram but I didn't use one because of lack of available space, but yes, the fuse will blow if anything goes wrong before it fries a BMS or a VESC

You could use the built in e-switch of the Bestech BMS, however in order to charge the eboard you would need to turn the battery on, I think this is a hassle as I'm not comfortable leaving my board on all night while it charges and wake up at the middle of the night so see if it reached 100% SOC so I could turn in off.

I rather have an independent antispark switch and just charge the battery with the battery off and forget about it until next day.
