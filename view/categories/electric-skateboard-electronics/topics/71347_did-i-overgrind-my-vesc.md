I found this double gRinder on the street and been grinding too many things.  With my boardâ€™s hole ![image|375x500](upload://bV9PPoMiKuEYgIlwwKGP7gLNyiT.jpeg) still wonâ€™t fit. one mm too narrow i ground the 6.6 Vesc. It shows copper.  Are there now connections squished into each other? Should I fire ðŸ”¥ it up and see what happens or do some kind of restoration?![image|375x500](upload://2AGm0B4eWb1YEpi6j5XvIBwQ297.jpeg) `![image|375x500](upload://qC1Mn5reJTkUMnpq3uW55QBlBeM.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://2a6Ei9bDShiQbybGgT2RbKurWdG.jpeg)

why did you do this and not modify the enclosure...

The enclosure is too nice! And this is easier w a grinder

i'd never be grinding a circuit board at all. im pretty sure the vesc is 4 layers of pcb so you might be lucky but i'd be insulating the exposed copper somehow

When u say four layers what u mean?  I can see what look like layers of copper but more than 4 maybe 6![image|375x500](upload://iVDUFlER9GBC33jY5Tl9aW7qpCi.jpeg) 
What u think. I took off max .5mm

Yeah Flipsky uses 6 layer on the 6.6, I reckon power it up and see what happens

Iâ€™ll see if anyone says donâ€™t at least a couple hours!  Those layers do they need be insulated from each other ?

Grinding the PCB is very, very bad.  I'm just not sure what to recommend.  Probably to clean up the edge and make sure there are NO microscopic slivers of copper shorting anything out, then power it up and hope.  But this is really bad.  The PCB needs its edge to be intact.

Yes!

Should I fire :fire: it up
[/quote]

You're not supposed to take this phrase literally

This is very likely to be a total loss.

This is the kind of modification that is frowned up in regards to the signal layer of the PCB.

So get out a microscope n make sure no connections between layers n insulate again?

Hello everyone. I am very new to this website and am very sorry to intrude on your conversation, but I just have one question to ask myself. Do you know how to start a thread? I have a few problems I need help solving. :sweat_smile:

my reccomendation is more grinding. Which is to say a whetstone or very fine grain sand paper, very lightly sand the edge for about 10 minutes to get a cleaner finish then it should be more likely to not be shorted... but its probably fucked. in a 6 layer board some of the layers are only likee 0.2 mm apart.

Maybe some of the layers are intended to be touching in some places and it looks solid copper in spots. Maybe thereâ€™s a good pic of whatâ€™s connecting to what.

The title of the this thread is really confusing, then I open it and figure out what's going on. Now it's pretty funny. :rofl: Sorry I am of no help hummie.

Maybe this is why the person threw it out, it has a curse that makes you grind everything until you have nothing left. :joy: :hot_face:

maybe if I use some etchant or acid that will eat the metal but not the pcb that will isolate.  with that in mind im thinking of grinding some more.

sand the edge to a fine grit and then conformal coating that sucka?

Did I overgrind my Vesc? That's what the heatsink is for, should be fine for a while.
