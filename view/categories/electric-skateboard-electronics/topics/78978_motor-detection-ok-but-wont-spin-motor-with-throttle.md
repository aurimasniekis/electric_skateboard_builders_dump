Hi all, this is probably simple but for the life of me I cant find what to search.

Ive got a, 80-100 motor on a flipsky vesc 6.6.
gone through the motor detection and everything was fine, i had to raise the amps but motor spun and hall sensors detected. In adc i set it to current and i am getting 100% on the gauge but when i throttle it cogs and cuts out

I sent it off to Martin, it had a few issues but thankfully he sorted it. Issues stemed from me blowing a 100a on/off switch, been working fine @58.8v ever since

Do you mean amps? What size is your battery?
