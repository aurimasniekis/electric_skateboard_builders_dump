Hello. i just received my nano x and so far i cannot make it bind properly... i read all posts on forum about the tape in the reciever about the signal wire... tried everything 

so far i cannot make it bind every time. i connected the reciever to 5v and it worked just fine .. some somewhere else should be the problem.. 

Any idea what could i try to make it bind every time ? Thank you.

if i play with the wire it will bind from time to time.. but im sure the wires are good cause i changed 5 wires so far and all do just the same. 

also i tought might be a problem with wire connectors so i soldered but still same result...

I have the same issue as you. But somehow I got them to work now.
