So I'm currently getting into building the electronics of my new build and am running the flipsky Dual FSESC6.6 ([this one](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/dual-fsesc6-6-plus-based-on-vesc6)). This VESC comes with a power switch but a lot of batteries also come with power switches. Which one do I use and if I am supposed to use the one on the VESC, what do I do with the other power button?

Turn the vesc on and hotglue the button to keep it on for good.

Then use the bms button for your main power toggling.
