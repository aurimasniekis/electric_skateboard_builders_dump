Just got my nano x replacement (thanks bara). But now I have another problem,

It has a green light and the receiver has a constant red light which means it's connected properly. 
Vesc tool is connected to focbox.

I'm sure it's not too crazy.  Didn't you disable the motor in vesc tool?  Also very hard to tell from that quick video.  Do you have a different RX to try?

Good. But not good either.  Now you have a remote that didn't work unless you opened it?  Unless you can pinpoint exactly what prevented it from working I would be very cautious.  Random not working while Accel or decel

My best guess is a dislodged or cold solder. About to open it back up and check connections.
