Can anyone supply me with the dimensions, please? I'm trying to work out if I will be able to fit them in dual configuration on my trucks. Are they a decent motor? has anyone fitted hall sensors? 

Thanks,
Shaun.

Ok. I’m using e-calibers so have a little more room. Would you mind measuring the can from the front face to back of the bearing?

Lenght is exactly 65,50mm.
I have already told you in your last topic, you can fit two on e-caliber, even with 15mm belts. :slight_smile:
