  are there any other vesc6-like versions available that are relatively cheap.  Or a vesc4 with all  the updated bits?  looking for whats available NOW.  ive blown up so many including the foxbox.  Im always running FOC

vanda's seems the old standard bom 4
flipsky's is too big (otherwise it seems good)
maytech seems like the standard bom 4
chaka and axle seem to be gone
any others?

Damn dude. What are you doing to all those poor VESCs? Maybe someone here has a couple Ollin/Chaka VESCs they'd be willing to part with. There's the ESCape too, but again, someone would have to have them in hand and be willing to part with them already.

some of mine are still good and i have the flysky 4s waiting...just want something i can rely on forever.  a version of the 6 i guess.  i am always at 100 motor amps and 12s and foc

Just so it’s out there as well.
 FLIP SKY
I have had all of their new 6.6 esc’s and the 2 versions they have. A full aluminum case one and a unit with just heat sink on it. 
They are basically the same units. ( case ) 
The case creates a heat envelope and is definitely a overheating issue. 
They have taken note. 
The unit with just the fined heat sink is on the money when it comes to heat dispersion. 
I have ran them through bench testing and I’m waiting to get them on a build.

flip has a sale that ends today 20% off.  how soon can you test the 6 without the case!?  how do you test because i dont know what damaged mine in the past but it didnt seem current related.  do you know the different parts and what was upgraded for the 6?  I guess parts could be fake too.  think im in for two tonight.  they do claim a year warranty.

  i have other new flipsky 4s i bought like 2 months ago I dont want to try and will sell if anyone is interested

I get that ppl feel the VESC6 is expensive and look for other options, but after never been able to kill myn I'd spend the extra pennies if I knew they would hold up so well. I didint buy mine tho, I soldered bare PCBs so I got off quite cheap. But if I were to need Another and couldnt be arsed with soldering again, I wouldnt hesitate.

They sell them with or without power switch, with or without enclosure. The enclosure imho is perfect for single motor setup. If you go with a double VESC better to get the ones with heat sink only.

@AutoItKing seems to know about the bits connected and he spotted it only has two shunts.   how does having two vs three effect things and what other differences are there on the board?  my only concern doesnt seem to be about amp ability and just not breaking while using 12s and foc

@Hummie HW4 only had two current shunts since the DRV8302 only had two current sense amplifiers. HW6 has three external current sense amplifiers (AD8418). This means better stability and better motor control. All VESC 6 based controllers should share this trait. (including the ESCape and others based on HW6).
Other than that there's just small improvements to hardware and a few added goodies like nRF.

The picture @bigdog referenced up above has a FSESC6, a FOCBOX (and its case) and three other HW4 versions.

The FSESC6.6 does include a low side switch (anti-spark switch) with a button to turn it on and off. Nice feature!

HW6 has a lot of fixes learned from HW4 and HW5. You should be able to run 12S at quite some current and be perfectly fine.

Note: HW4 refers to the "classic" VESC we're all familiar with. This includes the FOCBOX, eSk8.de, Maytech SuperESC and others. HW5 was an intermediate that was never actually produced. I think there is one ESC that used it. HW6 is any hardware based on the 6.4 or 6.6 schematics such as the FlipSky, ESCape, and of course the real VESC6.

you know more about the 6.6?  hard to find info or know what the info means.  can i hook any switch up to the low-side switch instead of their push button?  whats the other switch on the board for?  how good you think this 6.6 is in comparison to the other 6 variants or the real thing?

## \#37 Posted by: AutoItKing Posted at: 2018-08-04T18:52:57.384Z Reads: 144

I don't know, I'd have to get my hands on it to see how they implemented the push button. Best guess? Yeah probably.
I'm not seeing any other switch on the board, what are you referring to? Oh never mind I see what you're talking about. That little slide switch is for selecting the motor sensor voltage between 3.3 and 5V. All HW6 versions I've seen include it.
FlipSky isn't using DirectFETs so the thermal characteristics will be slightly worse than the real VESC6 or the ESCape and others using DirectFETs., but for most people it should be fine.

with such a huge heatsink...and id read the direct fets can be harder to put on the board right...if that's the biggest downside im happy with it as is.   im more worried about some lesser chip that should have a higher voltage rating or something and would blow after a while.  well im in for 2 of the 6.6 and also organized a group buy here too if anyone is interested.  115$ each!

i want to use it but dont want to use their button.   the button is probably a good deal but rather find something smaller.  and if we keep the gb without it i think more would be interested.  if you find a nice switch post it up!  so will any switch work with this?

I would imagine the pin out is something like this:

1: Control
2: Ground
3: LED

Connect 1 and 2 with the switch and 3 powers the LED in the switch.

but what about connecting this esc to switches generally and not the one they offer?  
does the switch have to have a rated voltage or amperage? 
 and not a "momentary switch" right?

## \#45 Posted by: AutoItKing Posted at: 2018-08-04T21:47:20.344Z Reads: 119

It's likely a latching push button, I would imagine the voltage and current rating is fairly low and probably has a 12V or 5V LED. This is just conjecture, an educated guess and I won't know for sure until I get one in my hands. I ordered two on Monday and they still haven't shipped.

It could be wired to a toggle style switch. It would have to be single pole double throw. And most you have to externally power the led. 
As for the flipsky the switch is optional. If it’s not plugged in it doesn’t engage. So you could use a switch before the esc. Or you can wire both into one switch. It’s the same for the new Maytech 100a

Yes it does. It constantly monitors the charge on the pad to know when to toggle the output, the state does not matter.
It uses fairly low power, 124 microamps on a 5V supply. But you will have to supply an always on 5V for it to work.
