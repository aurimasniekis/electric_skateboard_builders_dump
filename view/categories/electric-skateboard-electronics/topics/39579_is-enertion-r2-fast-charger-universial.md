Looking at the Cyber monday sales.

Is the Enertion R2 Fast Charger universial, so it will work with a DIY 10s2p battery?
Or does it only work with the Enertion space cell?

It works for any 10s battery.

Only issues I can see would be difference in polarity between charging ports and the size of the port. Otherwise it's just a 10s 4A charger.

I'm early on with my first build, thinking of picking this up in the Enertion sale, but don't currently have my battery yet.

Is it worth it or should I wait till everything else is built so I know its compatible with my battery? Or are there other better chargers available in the UK?

check ebay.  I purchased a 42v 5amp charger for $ 25 yesterday.  You should be able to find a similar deal.
