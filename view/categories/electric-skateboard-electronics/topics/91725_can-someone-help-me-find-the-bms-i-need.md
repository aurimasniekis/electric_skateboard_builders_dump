Depending on what you want to draw from your pack and if you want to use the bms for charge only or charge and discharge.

What board you building and where you plan to drive with?

You need a bms that can handle the amps your ESCs can output

Or get a charge only one

I guess you mean the unity has 160A

If you expect to pull that many amps, than yes a 160A bms will be fine
