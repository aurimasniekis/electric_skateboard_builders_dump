As the title says I am having an issue with my 6.6 in regards to CAN. I had the board set up and working wonderfully then went to change some settings and it forced me to update the firmware on the escs. I did this then tried to carry on with the reprogramming as usual however I had issues with the PPM programming so that both motors get powered off one signal. I tried to look around and haven't found any smilar issues so I am quite confused. Any help is good help so give me all ya got!
Thank you

Is the CAN switch flipped on on the PCB?

Are you able to run detection on each VESC independently? maybe one side has blown.
