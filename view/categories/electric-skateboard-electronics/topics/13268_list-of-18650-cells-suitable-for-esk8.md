Hi firstly great forum and have been reading up loads.:slight_smile:

Did search first but am looking for a list of 18650 cells which are considered suitable for esk8

Samsung 25R seems to be on a lot of peoples lists but would be interested in what others have had success with.

Weighing them is the easiest way.

Thanks just weighed one of my Samsung INR 18650 30Q (well regarded in the vaping community) and getting 46.1g. That cell was from a highly trusted source from the uk.....
