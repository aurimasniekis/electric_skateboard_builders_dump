Wowgo and Meepo both offer their "extended range" battery packs, both stating usage of Sanyo cells.

What configuration are these?  Anyone use these in DIY builds?

(there is an option for a Sanyo 8.5 Ah)

I'm using the pack from meepo and getting around 26-32km range.

30amp max current discharge.
And I'm on the safe side for charging so just -1amp right now.

EDIT! was a typo. Was supposed to write -1amp.

You get quite good size to capacity ratio. But at 30A (15each) it does såg a bit. Defenlty more than Vtc6.
They are supposed to have low capacity loss though, at least that's what I have read.

How does one of those Sanyo packs compare to a Samsung 30Q 10S3P pack? The cost ends up being very similar and it seems like the Sanyo is composed of superior cells right?

Price wise you can calculate yourself. Unless you have space constraints i wold most likely chose 30Q. You would get higher discharge rate and higher charge rate.  10s2p sanyo will give you 8Ah, 10a3p Samsung will gince 9Ah

Sorry, I’m sort of a noob, been doing a lot of research but still learning. You’re saying the pack of Samsungs would generally be better? I’ve read a lot of hype about the “Tesla Batteries”.

All the Chinaboard companies advertise the Sanyo pack as “Tesla”, but I guess that could just be misleading marketing...

@bobbobman Dont take my word for granted. But in my opinion yes. 
@Bobby Tesla does not tell what they use. But they have used a slightly modified Panasonic 3400mAh for Models S and X. While for Model 3 they use (from what i read) the same battery as these Sanyo. Panasonic owns Sanyo, and has invested a lot in Gigafactory. So i think in principle Panasonic, Sanyo and Tesle batteries are the same.

Tesla batteries are only used in Tesla Model 3 and are not sold anywhere else. So they are not Tesla batteries. But they are Sanyo. Shape and size is tha same and maybe the chemistry is quite alike but they are Sanyo.

I find that the sanyo 20700b cell perfect for lightweight builds but I can be wrong. 
Will build a 10s3p for my next board.

How come?. @CBom

20x63gram=1250gr      sanyo 20700b    8Ahx36v=288Wh(230Wh/kg)        Max 30A C.Discharge      
30x45gram=1350gr      samsunb 30q     9Ahx36v=324Wh(240Wh/kg)        Max 45A C.Discharge


Don't get me wrong I use them myself. But from a performance and price point if there are no space constraints there is no good reason to buy 20700B yet.

Would it be feasible to take the cells of the Wowgo2s (Samsung 18650 10s2p), purchase an extra 10 cells and make it a 10s3p?

As much as I am disappointed at the general specification of the meepo components, I must applaud their effort of selling the individual parts for builders to customise their rides.

And its nice to see that they are offering flight safe 10S batteries! 

With that in mind has anyone taken the shrink wrap off of these to confirm the cell they've used?  I wonder how easy it would be to rearrange these into a flat pack configuration?

Rearranging then in flat pack is as difficult as making a new pack. In that case buy the cells yourself and put them together.

I hear that here and there. But the spec sheet says different. They are like all other cells. Let me  assure you one thing. If someone came up with the cell wich is 10x better that news would spread faster than light.

The Sanyo cells actually perform pretty good.
For the wowgo/meepo/ownboard esk8's they are good enough, because the esc only pulls max 18A (so let's say 20A max)
For a 10S2P the sanyo's and 30Q only need to give 10A max and if you look at the tests, the 30Q and sanyo perfom almost the same.
![chrome|690x388](upload://qzuYpQ36Ej2605yvWDiGYjz3e3q.png)
At the end they even perform a bit better than the 30Q at 15A continue, so I should say these sanyo cells are perfect for max 20A continues discharge.

My enclosure only fits 20 cells, so a 30 cell 30Q doesn't work for me. However, the Meepo 20700b Sanyo 10s2p shouds fit snug in my Backfire 2 enclosure, while doubling my capacity. Only question I have is what other safety features are built into the pack, besides the BMS. Is there individual cell level fuses to prevent thermal runaway in the event of a short?

In 2016, Tesla introduced silicon into the former graphite anode. The silicon oxide is the reason for 10x energy capacity. Check out: The Truth About Tesla Model 3 Batteries: Part 1 on YouTube.

Sorry if this isn't in the topic for the thread. I'll give it a shot. So i got a wowgo 2s with the 8.5 AH sanyo battery. I'm about to start building a Trampa mountainboard build with 2x 3500 watt 149kv motors and 80 amps peak discharge. I habe not ordered a battery yet since i thought i could try using the sanyo battery from my wowgo to test the performance before i decide wich pack to get for the trampa. 

My question is regarding the wowgo sanyo can handle my components since the discharge seems to be limited via the wowgo bms. Will this just limit the performance of my setup or is it even harmfull for the cells if i would plug it into my trampa build?

The label on the pack says 18650 cells. I will get a new pack. I just want to use this pack to determine if i want a 10s (wowgopack is 10s2p) or if i feel like the extra power from a 12s would be better. I'm mostly conserned that i could harm the sanyo packs BMS if i use it on a 7000 watt setup.

@jju17

Don't want to be rude. But if you don't know how or where to start than it is better for you to try and learn a bit more first. I say this mostly for your safety. 

There are plenty of videos on YouTube, I wold suggest you start there.

probably because Trampa vesc has cut off voltages set for 12s battery, so it "sees" 10s battery as empty.

Aoch the things I wrote last year makes me cringe 😅

As mentioned above, if you bought your trampa from Trampa the vescs are pre-programmed for 12s (50.4v) and the wowgo battery is 42v fully charged. 

Secondly the wowgobattery is designed for a much weaker system and has a peak discharge of 40A (if it's the Sanyo battery). So even if you set the vescs to 10S voltage the wowgo battery won't be able to deliver the juice that you trampa craves, hope that explains it.

I bought the parts in a spaced time frame and built it myself. So I changed the input voltage to 10s on the vescs

Hmm I thought Sanyo had 10A dis harge? It's a 10s2p so 20 amp max discharge?

I had issues with blowing vescs due to incorrect settings. But I was able to get enough power out of it to perform better than my wowgo boards hubs. I'll plug in the vesc and check settings when I get home. Current setup does not move the board weighted as it did before.

These are values I have set now as advised by Trampa for my battery 10s2p Sanyo from wowgo

![app|281x500](upload://uOirKfggMTfL3h0NjMYG5hmb6RT.jpeg)


These are the values I had before that were causing vesc t blow but was working for a while with the duel fesc 6.6 I was told these values would work for my battery motors and vesc from a member on the esk8 discord server who helped me set it up initially 

Battery pet vesc
15a
-7a

Motors per motor
60a
