Yep, this was a huge pain in the ass.
So much so that I just went unsensored. I know @psychotiller sells adaptors though

For the sensor wires you usually need an adapter unless you're soldering directly onto the focbox connection.. There are a few people on here selling those adapters I believe. 

Focbox comes with 3.5mm bullets on phase wires, while some motors have 5.5mm plugs. Either you switch bullets on vesc side (and possibly void warranty) or you switch on motor side or use adapters. 

Only the sensor wire that doesn't fit on your setup? 

Good luck

Thanks Sebike,
Yes that it‚Äôs true, the bullets are also different 
But I gues that‚Äô an easier fix, right?
The sensor cable with so many wires is more complicated.
I already sent a message to the adapter seller...
Regarding the bullets...
Now that I am looking at it, how do you know witch is witch, if all the 3 fase wires are black?

One more question:
The motor has 3 phase wires
1 red 1 blue 1 yellow 
The focbox has all 3 black wires
How do you know witch is witch?
Or this means you can conect randomly?
Once again, I would really appreciate your comments 
Thanks

The FOCBOX (and VESCs) will automatically detect which phase lead is connected to which phase and take care of all of that for you...

Just plug them in and do the motor detection and you are good to go

```
The deal is, connect them randomly and if the motor spins in the wrong direction, switch any 2 of the wires around. That will change the direction of spin.

Sometimes if sensor detection fails, especially in BLDC mode, rearranging the motor connections may help.

Thanks for your help

Now that you mention it,
In a dual motor setup, if motors are mounted each one facing opposite sides, then you will have to set them up to turn in opposite directions, so when you mount them, the wheels will turn in the same direction, I guess.

This thread about the phase wires has saved me asking the same question üòÇ The wire diagram doesn't say which wire goes where and I was guessing it didn't matter, but always nice to see it 'in print' üëç

DOES void warranty... pissed me off when I found that out.  Would rather be pissed on than off and re-doing bullet connectors. :rofl:
