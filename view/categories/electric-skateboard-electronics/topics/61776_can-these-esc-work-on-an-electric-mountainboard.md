I used that diyboard esc on my trampa mountain board  just for a couple lof weeks while i waited for my Max6's to arrive, Was ok for roads/paths but dont over work it with serious offroad tracks ect!  In short, Yes it works but i wouldn't trust it to be durable or last a particular long time.

For a  mountain board id definitely recommend Max6, their basically bulletproof!  I believe there's a thread on the forum about, Max6 vs Vesc, i remember reading it when i was was trying to to decide the very same thing.

'Edit' found it - https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/debating-max6-vs-vesc-and-8s-12s/25748/7

I have two differents builds.

1) DUAL HOBBYWING XERUN 6S 190KV 14/45 (sensored)

2) DUAL FOCBOX 12S 130KV 11/40 (sensored FOC)

The XERUNS 6S manage "real" off-road better than the FOCBOX 12S.
