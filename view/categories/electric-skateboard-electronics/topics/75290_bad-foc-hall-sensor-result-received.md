Trying to set up FOC hall sensors, with a SK8 6364 and FS4.12, the detections all work fine until I get to the hall sensor detection, the motor spins but just an error of a bad result, any ideas?

Tried it with my other SK8 6364, same result. What order should the wires be that go into the vesc?

I might be wrong but donâ€™t you need an adapter for the sk8

6 wires, trying to take one apart now to see if the sensor is still intact
