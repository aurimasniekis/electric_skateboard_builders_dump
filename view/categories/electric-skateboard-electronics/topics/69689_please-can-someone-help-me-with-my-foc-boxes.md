U have to connect the FocBoxes together either by CanBus or Split Servos

CanBus

Split servo

If u use canbus u only need to program one FocBox and the other will just follow. One "master" and one "slave"
But if u use servos u have to individually program each focbox with the same settings excluding the motor detection

Yes Dude, I've connected it together, and it works, I can ride it but! One of the motors dosnt seem to be working properly, needs abit of a push to get it going. And wen I'm riding it stutters now an then. It's scary, it's thrown me of a few times,
Just need to program it right? I'm useless wen it comes to computers, 
When I got to motor detection it keeps saying, bad detection?

if it says bad detection than something wrong.
did you made the motor detection with or without belt?
what does the hall sensor table say? they also failed?

Do u have a picture of the motor you r using? If the hall sensors failed then u can still ride it but u have to push off to start.

itÂ´s recommended to do the motor dedection without belt.
try that out later. hope it will already help.

I buy the plugs and pins in my local electric store.
Or get it on amazon, eBay or Ali 
Schau, was ich auf AliExpress gefunden
