Hello everyone, 

Happy New Year! 
I have a quick and small question. 
I want to purchase a new push button for my ESC, but I can't figure out how much voltage does the button need.

Please have a look at the image above, that is the ESC I am using. I am running it at 36V, does that mean my push button must also be 36V or can be less? 
Thanks in advance for the help!

The button itself doesn't pas voltage, it only opens or closes a circuit.  Pretty much any locking button works.
