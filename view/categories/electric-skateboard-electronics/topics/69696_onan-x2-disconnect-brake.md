The only problem with the first X2 (BLDC)model is, that you re not able to break if your batterie is fully charged. That means you can break, but it would fry something inside because of the energy that goes back. So you cannot start your ride downhill with fully charged batteries while breaking constantly going down that hill....that sounds scary but it isn't, because you just have to ride a few hundred meters and you will always be fine. On these first few hundred meters you ARE ABLE to break, but not for a long period of time. I have got the first generation of the X2 and i destroyed the esc while going downhill with full charged batteries while pulling the throttle constantly back like you do when you want to generate power back. MY FAULT! At the other hand I have to say that since then I never had any single issue at all and i am violating this thing hard almost every day. With some little modifications it is almost waterproof, so no worries to ride rainy weather conditions.
After one year of skating this thing i got myself the new version of the X2 4WD which runs in FOC. In this model the "fully charged downhill break issue" is solved and you can start your ride downhill while pulling the breaks for minutes without any damage. The power and the torque is insane and its hard to stay on this beast sometimes hahahaha
