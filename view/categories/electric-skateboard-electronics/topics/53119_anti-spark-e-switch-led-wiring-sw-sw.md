Hi all - this is newbie question, and could not find in the forum the exact answer....here it goes:

I need to plug a LED momentary switch (5pin) to a anti-spark (4 pin) from luna-cycle (i got without a switch; hence the question). Anyone can help me with wiring?

Switch = +, -, NC, NO, C
Anti-Spark= GND, SW+, SW-, +12V

SW- - C
"+" - +12v

Are you sure this will work? I've only seen non-momentary switches used with anti spark switches.
