I'm in need of a 13s BMS.

I have used the D140 charge only BMS, and BKB's has the 10s in stock, but the 13s is out of stock.  Does anyone know if these models are all the same?  The 10s model has pins all the way out to 16s.![0000004_bestech-d140-10s-bms_550|528x500](upload://ykCMFBupFmQ3LbiifEr0B9TRmyi.png)

the pcb is the same but only populated for the S count you buy it for.
why not to get it directly from bestech? shipping takes too long?
