So i havent had a need for a soldering iron any of my past hobbies until now. So im new to soldering irons. What kind of wattage will i need and how hot does it need to get? I have about 50 usd to use on this and i wanted to ask first before i buy some random one from the auto shop i have near me and learn it isnt suitable.

I would seriously try to increase your budget and get a Weller WESD51.

If you must stay cheap, find the chunkiest looking Weller within your budget.

I was going to say the same thing until I saw the budget, then I left :rofl:

I've had many $50 ones fail but the WESD51 just always works, and works great.

For the price weller is a solid choice, also a very solid option is this little guy:

https://www.amazon.com/NovelLife-Mini-TS100-Soldering-Digital/dp/B07D35B75T/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?hvadid=176302638120&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9031939&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvpos=1t2&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=10724625757763024161&amp;hvtargid=kwd-145719817977&amp;keywords=ts100+soldering+iron&amp;qid=1554861454&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;psc=1

It has the advantage of being small, portable and you can power it directly from RC lipo. (Or usb-C battery pack with a QC trigger, like I do)

This is a really high quality iron, you might think otherwise. Search for reviews online, everyone loves it.

The only issue I've had with Weller was a pencil too becoming wallered out. Probably could've just drilled a hole or two for set screws, but I just bought a new pencil. It was probably my fault as I was hot swapping tips and tightening with channel locks.

Hakko is good too! As long as you do some research and maybe watch a review video or two you should be fine. Most soldering irons are "you get what you pay for" category. The one exception being the small little guy I mentioned, but yeah for battery stuff you'll want something with more punch.

Maybe I've gotten lucky... I found a cheapo $19 variable temperature, I think maybe 40W iron from microcenter that's been going strong for about a year and a half, maybe two years. I couldn't say what it is, some totally off brand, but I love it. It solders 10AWG and 5.5mm bullets great... But I'm thinking about picking up one of those cheap 100W $20 Weller irons for soldering 8AWG and below... I don't want to hold heat on nickel longer than I need to.

TS100 or TS80

TS100 is about $55, TS80 is about $80, but includes everything you need.

TS80 has better performance.

Both irons feature temperature control, 100°C <-> 400°C.

TS80 can solder TO-220 drain tabs to 6"x6" ground plane, and I have no problems soldering 10 AWG wire with it.

Honestly, I've used a hakko benchtop station (cann't remember which one) and the TS80 definitely beats it.

I think 450°C is much better for XT90 and battery stuff.  It's counterintuitive, but you can keep things cooler with a hotter iron.

Is this real 450°C or just a 450°C setting?

Flux vapourizes instantly above 350°C and almost every iron I've used oxidizes at those 
temperatures.

The tip technology has a much more significant impact on heat delivery than the temperature difference from my experience. As I said, it can solder a heatsink to a huge copper ground plane.

Hmm, I can't imagine why you would need such high temperatures, I had an other iron with analog temp settings, was not fun to use, but I would have to set it to max (450°C) when soldering thick wires and stuff like that.

I saw in some reviews of the TS80, the TS80 actually heat up solder and copper planes faster than the TS100 despite being LOWER power :man_shrugging: . 
The Weller uses the old tip technology correct? The one with the ceramic heating element? The newer tip technology has the heater and thermocouple embedded in the tip, making heat transfer and temperature regulation much more efficient. I noticed this on older tips using the old ceramic technology, while the station thinks the tip is at x temperature, the component being heated is at a significantly lower temperature, so a higher temperature is set to compensate. 

When I set the temperature on my TS80 to anything above 330°C, literally everything starts burning unless I touch it to something with significant heat capacity; above 350°C, doesn't matter what it's touching, can't stop the burning. 

I've had no issues myself with soldering to huge copper pours and ground planes as well as XT60s. I haven't soldered XT90s yet, but I will find out how it performs this weekend.

Just to be clear, I'm not saying you *need* such high temperatures.  I'm saying it's easier to use and you can keep things cooler sometimes if you have the ability to use higher temperatures.

Especially things like XT90 or large 10AWG wires.

Also, protip: plug the XT90 male/female together when you solder them.  It will keep the pins straight.

```
I understand. What I am trying to say is, despite the lower max temperature setting, the TS80s set at 300°C or 330°C may very well end up performing better than the Weller set to 450°C, due to the difference in heater and tip technology.

Like, although you are setting a higher temperature on the Weller, you may not be  getting that higher temperature at the end of the tip. 

What matters here is heat delivery, and the various tests that can be found on youtube demonstrate the TS80 excelling at that feature. 
Increasing the temperature setting is one method of increasing heat delivery.

What I'm trying to say is, the TS80 can also keep things cooler by heating up the critical elements to solder's melting point faster (without heating up other elements).

But, we won't really know which is better until someone does a head to head test.

I've got a really nice JBL station but it struggles to push the watts, it's a surgical tool for surface mount stuff.

The TS80! I forgot that came out! I saw a prototype of it a couple years ago and forgot about it. USB-C, so good.

I have a very cheap soldering station that works just fine even with 10awg wires. I use the Dibotech 48W analog soldering station. It works perfectly fine if you just give it a few minutes to heat up properly.

What you need to thing about when soldering thick wires is to pre-tin everything and also put some tin on the tip to help transfer the heat onto whatever your soldering. It's only about $30 in Sweden :)

I know some people have mentioned it but I actually just bought 2 TS 80's (one extra on accident)  so I was just going to return the extra one but thought I should throw it up on here first and then I saw this post. lol. I Literally just got it in the mail last Friday. I am semi new to soldering as well and taught myself (youtube actually did) in Nov/.Dec a few months ago. I bought a cheapo kit from amazon and it was ok but already broke (I just use it for esk8 as well). I fucking love this ts80 though. It had crazy good reviews and everyone thought it wouldn't be as good or as powerful as its TS100big brother, but seems it is, if not better. Highly recommend. The fact you can use it with a USB-C cable and quick charge power bank is just awesome. Small, sleek, cnc'd, tips are dope and can be changed in .5 seconds. If anyone wants it for what I paid lmk, I think I spent just short of $90 for the "more" kit that comes with a really nice silicone USB-c cable, wall plug adapter, tip, and something else. I've been researching different firmware you can add too since it's open source which is another pretty cool feature. And its "smart" so cools down when you set it down and aren't using it then heats up as soon as you pick it up back to where you and set it at.

TS100 is a champ for the money, I've had mine for maybe 4 years, power it from a lipo battery and it's never missed a beat, different tips for different jobs. It can do the fine stuff and has no problems stepping up to heavier duty jobs, I've done Xt90s, and even amass150s on 10awg.

Top tip though, get a good iron to start with, it will save you a ton of trouble in the long run, cold solder joints are a nightmare of intermittent faults that will take a ton of time to troubleshoot.

There is a difference between temperature and power. 

You solder the best around 300-350 degree depends on the solder you use. When you go higher then the temp then more toxic fumes are released. 

If you have a low wattage solder iron you must set your temperature way higher because the temperature dips much when you solder a big wire. If you have a high power solder iron it has enough wattage to keep the temparture the same while soldering.

Would highly recommend the ts100.
get a 24v mean well power supply (Mean Well LRS-100-24) and wack it up to 25-26V and you got a killer iron. Dont skimp on the voltage, it makes a massive difference.
I use the C4 tip for larger stuff and D24 for the circuitboards and smaller things.
make the power cord yourself with some 20-22awg silicone wire.
if you got a 3d printer there are some nice accessories and stuff you can print out for it.

From my experience, you do not need precision or anything fancy but just raw power to solder these thick wieres

Im currently using this [station](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/soldering-station-with-adjustable-heat-range-with-eu-plug.html?___store=en_us)   get the tips package for another 6$ and you will be able to solder all the wires without problems, It still did not fail on me after being used each day for 3 hours

But when you get some more money to spend on a soldering iron go with weller, I have one thats almost 25 years old and it still works!

Also if the hand gets broken, worn out burned or whatever a new one costs 5$ and the heating element is around 5$ as well so you will not have to worry about it :D

The first soldering iron I purchased was [this one](https://hobbyking.com/cz_cz/turnigy-947-iii-standard-eu-plug.html) for ~5 EUR from HobbyKing. I managed to do pretty much any soldering job with it... once I learned how to do it. IMO soldering is much more about technique than about the iron you use. The way you apply the solder is everything. If you do it right such that you have thermal bridges and good heat transfer, it will work even with a cheap iron. If you do it wrong, an expensive iron won't help. 

I upgraded my cheapo iron to TS100. I like it a lot but it's mainly because it heats up really quickly (in less than 10s whereas with the HobbyKing one I had to wait over a minute) and because I can power it from a LiPo battery. However, though it's certainly noticeably easier to work with, I wouldn't say it's actually THAT MUCH of a difference.

That said, don't worry too much about which iron to get, but be sure to learn how to use it correctly because that's what makes the real difference.

I wrote a bunch about irons before, but the short version is, cartridge tip systems like hakko t12, the weller @b264 has,   ts100/ts80, pace, metcal, jbc perform a lot better than the older tech stuff. Absolutly cheapest nice iron will be the nonam arduino controlled t12 irons. Ts80/100 are nice but you have to add a nice silicone wire, psu and stand to make it nice to use. My money would go to a used pace station, around 50w. Used industrial/commercial over chinzy new hobby stuff every single time.

The thing that makes the biggest difference for soldering big things is a big tip. Whatever you get, get a small and medium chisel tip, and the biggest tip the system has.

@b264 stop abusing your nice station! ;) Get the biggest tip in the system and lower the temps!

I would get this. I have a couple. It's a bit of a weird system for assembly line use. Temperature is controlled by a plug-in thing with a resistor in it, so workers can't change temperature willy nilly. This one comes with "8" which is 800F, a bit too hot, but it's easy to make one for 650F or 700F. Heats up in about 10 sec. Tip looks like the biggest tip already. The pace system has really cheap and durable tips. Really nice station to use. Missing the iron holder though!

The Heatwise are a bit older and more rare. There's an adjustable temp version. The used ones often are missing the handle, which can be a pain to get ahold of.

Hm $13 shipping, and missing the holder. Maybe offer $50 and see what happens.

I have a hakko that everyone raves about, but I also have an Amazon One that was brilliant. 

Unfortunately, it’s sold out. I’d by two more in a heartbeat. It tackled stupid big 6-7mm bullets and double 8ga wire like a champ. It’s the blue and black one. After 8 months of hard service, I think it’s going bad. RIP. 

I got another amazon one and it works but struggles with xt90 loop keys. It’s the grey, non-hakko one. Only buy for small jobs if at all.

Anyone use this Milwaukee one? It seems like such a convenient gadget. I suspect is disappoints like every other cordless iron.

Milwaukee one?

The TS100 running off lipo just absolutely kills this. Or the TS80 running off a powerbank with usb-c.

For $60 you can get this one. I use it and so do a few other family members, the oldest one is atleast 5 years old and still doing great. I love have the hot air gun.

Has anyone tried this: https://www.weller-tools.com/professional/USA/us/Weller+Consumer/Soldering+Guns/Soldering+Guns/9400PKS

I just picked one up cause it was the only one that could do 100/140 watts locally and was cheap enough. 

Says it heats up in 6 seconds, I swear it was less and it immediately melted lead free solder... I'm sure this thing will handle low guage wire easy and soldering to nickel strips as fast as possible.

TS100 owners: What is the thermal mass of the chisel/bigger tip like with this iron? Can it easily solder 10 AWG wire?

I'm currently using a 60w iron and it's impossible to solder such thick wire because the tip doesn't have enough thermal mass to heat the wire all the way through. Even with a chisel/bigger tip installed.
