Anyone in Canada build battery packs? I don't really trust myself to put one together and I was wondering if anyone could make a 10S2P outta these https://liionwholesale.com/collections/batteries/products/lg-hb6-18650-battery-genuine-tested-30a-continuous-1500mah-flat-top-wholesale-discount?variant=13978272644 with a 60A BMS and a switch.

I'd be interested too for future batteries. I guess you like those for the higher current draw? Space is an issue? 

I know @landonkun had a battery made. But I'm not sure if the person still does that or if it was a favour.

Yeah, I wouldn't advertise the fact that I can have them built (as I don't want people to think it's a business), but I don't mind helping out people here and there :slight_smile:

 @NickTheDude send me a pm and we can talk details if you want.

It's not that space is an issue, just that I like to keep things as small and light as possible and I really don't need much range. It opens the door to using some of these high discharge/low capacity cells.

Ya both of my boards are really heavy. I've been debating making my grocery getter much smaller and lighter. Like the riptide sort of... winter project.
landonkun is a good guy. I've dealt with him and chatted many times.
