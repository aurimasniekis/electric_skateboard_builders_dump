How can these be legit resellers when in their specs it says max. cont. disc. at 20A when the datasheet for 30Q clearly says max 15A? I know that they _CAN_ do 20A but still.

They are aware that 15a is what Samsung says

I havenâ€™t done a discharge test but inspecting the cells they look identical to my Nkon 30Qs. The only difference is that Fogstar seems to print this on them:

![image|375x500](upload://h7PHBt0Fa4DWyVjE4UwBGrg7wd8.jpeg)

But apart from that the wrap is the same, labels the same (including the numbers underneath the pink wrap, on the body of the cell).

@egzplicit You going 12S4P too? I'm in contact with BesTech about getting a 12S HCX-D596 BMS (90A), let me know if you want in.

I actually have 60 cells in total so it might be a 10s6p. Iâ€™m thinking getting into trampas and while I like the smooth looks of an under deck battery and electronics, it limits clearance and battery size... so I might go with the 10s6p in a box in the middle.

I also have chargers and bms for 10s systems so thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m sticking to that. Iâ€™m also scared a 12s might damage the focboxes.

```
Bms that doesnâ€™t balance? They all balance. Bypassed for discharge means you discharge straight from the cells but charge via bms, so it balances just fine. A bms also usually only balances when charging anyway.

Got them ages ago, canâ€™t remember. Should be around Â£30 or so.

a lot of people bypass them because it allows you to have a small bms instead of a massive one, saving space. Just use a fuse for safety and should be good.
