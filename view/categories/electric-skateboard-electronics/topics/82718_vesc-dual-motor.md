if you're tight on budget, the sk8 esc from Hobbyking works great for their price. you can run 2 of them together so if one blows, you can pretty much hot swap one of them out. whereas the dual esc's, if one side blows you gotta buy the whole dual unit

Location on your profile my friend then we can point you to items/vendors that can be easily obtained shipping wise.  As for motor controllers well theres a whole forum full of reviews about practically every variant out there.  Personally speaking the best 4.12 is a focbox.  Now the Unity has taken over that mantle but its a dual. HK sk8 are a great cheap option and work very well.  I use both focboxes and HK and both are reliable and strong.
