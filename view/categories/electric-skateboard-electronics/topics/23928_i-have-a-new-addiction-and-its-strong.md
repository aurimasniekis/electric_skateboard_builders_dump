@blasto actually digikey is on it! they shipped within hours! its ups i'm waiting on! 
markups for components on prime are too high and lots of fake/low quality stuff.

next time i'll try mouser since they are in tx instead of mn.

@wmj259 its a surprise till I get the rest of the parts! but i'm sure someone could figure it out if they look close enough...
