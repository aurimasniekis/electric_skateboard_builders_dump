Im looking for a 10s3p pack made with 30q cells. I have very tight dimensions. shipped to NYC. Can anyone on here help out. 
@barajabali @evoheyax @JLabs @psychotiller @thisguyhere @willpark16 @longhairedboy 
      
Honestly I would like to fit the biggest pack I can in there. But I estimated it to be 10s3p but maybe u can put larger after u check the pictures.

A normal 60amp BMS I'm sure won't fit in the thickness that I have to work with. It has to be a very small BMS in the front just used just for charging not discharging so it can be tiny and very little amps BMS. 

This is what im working with. Ruler is included.

What would be your max height?

We can do it. We have some pretty small charge only 10s bms's too! (And cells)

Let me lay out the cells just to confirm dimensions. $320 shipped ($335 with charger)

What kind of amps do you need?

You could fit a 10s4p technically. But wouldn't have space for a bms on the battery.

Is there space for a tiny bms around on on top of the esc?

you think i can fit 10s4p?
@evoheyax  pack should handle as much amps as the cells can take since im not discharging from the bms.

Technically, my calculations say you can fit 20.4 cells per row, assuming the cell is 18.6mm wide.  You have 324mm of space, divide that by 18.65, you get 20.4. So yea, you could fit 40 cells if you wanted, but yea, don't know if theres a bms small enough out there to fit somewheres else in the board.


Do you know if those ESC's do 12s?

You could do a 12s3p, get better power output and range than a 10s3p, with 36 cells. Leaves space for small bms :)

interesting. This is the halo board. Not sure what kind of chinese esc it uses. or how many volts it can handle. i know that it comes with a 10s battery.

Let me look into it. I know that ESC is very popular these days, as it's $40 for a dual drive, instead of $300 ish for proper VESCs.

If it uses the $63 dual ESC then they only go up to 10s.

Yea, that's what my research is pointing to.

So 10s3p with bms, or 10s4p with no bms or reposition the bms elsewhere.

It looks like there could be some space on top of the ESC for a small bms, hard to tell from those pictures though.

No room for a 4p, without relocating the bms.

Though we do have a seriously small charge only 10s bms.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/f/7fc2fe5e7414add0c413fb4673ffa78e063b96a0.jpg" width="689" height="390">

If charge only bms, why not routing balancing cables to a 10 pin (or more..)  connector and having bms hooked up to the charger externally. Would save you some space ðŸ˜Š

Just need to make sure balancing cables and +/- are plugged in in correct order every time you connect the charger not to burn the bms.

We could do a 10s4p if you did the balance charging port, which I have in stock also (must be special ordered and can take months otherwise). I'm on my phone right now, but can give you some prices in about an hour if you can wait :)

You can make a 3d printed case and house the BMS on top of the deck at the back easily. I think its worth having the extra 10 cells IMO

We only have enough cells to make you a 10s3p right now. Could order more cells and have them in a week though. $400

So I don't have 30q cells on hand, so it could take a week for cells. I don't have a small bms on hand, though we have this cool balancing board in the mail were excited to try (auto balances over time).

Lead time could be a few weeks to a month (depending on the shipping time for the bms), but for the 10s3p, I can quote you at $250, and for a 10s4p, $350, both with a small discharge only bms.

Ok everyone thanks for your help. @evoheyax i dont wanna wait too long for that BMS (could take forever). 
@psychotiller can you do the 10s3p with small bms and charger for $300 total.

Not to hijack the thread but I could use a quote for Li-ion pack I plan on using racerstar 5065 200kv and a focbox. I am on a somewhat limited budget for the total board as a majority of my money currently goes to my custom skateboard side business. Also not sure if I'm going with 1 motor or 2. PMs are best so I dont totally hijack @Mikeomania12 thread.  Thanks everyone for your time and I apologize to Mike for hijacking your thread
