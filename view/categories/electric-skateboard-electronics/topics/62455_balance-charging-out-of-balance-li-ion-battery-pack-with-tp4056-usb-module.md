I want to charge out of balance groups of my battery with this USB charging module through the balance leads. What do I have to be aware of? Can I just proceed from one end to the other? Is there any particular lead which I should not bridge? Do I need to start at the negative end or positive of the battery? 
Any help would be really appreciated!![20180721_224720|690x388](upload://4d2Wa4ONqYg8Gwu4B9KEHdtdENQ.jpg)

You can start anywhere. Just make sure to always do the two pins immediately next to each other. There are no particular pins you shouldn't bridge but brodging two pins not right next to each other might blow your module as the voltage will be too high. I recommend starting at negative and working towards positive.
