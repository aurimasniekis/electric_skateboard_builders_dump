looks exactly like the one I posted from aliexpress:

Edit: funny how they seem to not be available anymore for order and vanished from the hobbytech shop overview. Maybe someone has a deal going on with them? :wink:

They look exactly the same, except a lot cheaper. If that's the case, are torqueboard's hubs a total rip off? Or am i missing details that make torqueboard's hubs superior?

well he is including wheels and trucks. Plus he gives you warranty and customer service.
My guess is they are the same motors but price is always hard to compare when you deal directly with the manufacturer in china or a shop in the US

These hub motors are upgraded from the ones you see on Aliexpress. Original one has a stator of about 20mm width if I remember correctly. The new one is 30mm in width so it's a bigger stator which means more power.

But yes, you would get our warranty and customer service.

Coming next week we'll be more active once again. So count on a new website and more products coming soon as well as better support :slight_smile: We'll be revamping a lot.

Any questions feel free to let us know.

Would the 75 or 130 KV have more torque if I don't care about top speed?
I can make whatever battery pack would be ideal
```

## \#9 Posted by: torqueboards Posted at: 2016-06-15T17:22:16.071Z Reads: 263

75KV would have more torque. 130KV for 6S. Although, you could go 12S on 130KV too for more top speed.

I'll have more testing and videos soon. Originally, I wanted a 90mm option but still debating on it.

What's there to debate ?? 90mm is the only right size, these 83mm have very little urethane..and 90mm could solve it  :slight_smile:

The fact that they don't let you order them anymore makes me a little bit suspicious...
@torqueboards Did you make a deal with the manufacturer?

I'll try and get the 90mm size. I like 90mm too :)

@philipp Yes, they should not be selling it anymore. I personally like the use of the axle nut locking the hub motor into the axle versus other designs.

gotta keep in mind that these 107mm wheels weigh at least a pound of two. I visited the dudes at Eglide last weekend and they had the 107mm Abecs and dear god, they are insane! I feel like they may theoretically reach a higher speed, but they'll take forever to get there.

Hey guys..

I can do 90mm wheels. Any preference in color?

I like the black on black. :slight_smile:

I was just ordering all the parts for my next build but now you stole the wheels. I like the design too and they fit the trucks I already bought, while being very stealthy.
When will single ones be available and what's your price+shipping costs to switzerland?

@philipp - They are better now then they were before. :slight_smile: Free shipping over $300 and so pretty much free shipping. Now, you get a 90mm wheel, bigger stator + black on black.

@Nordle - I'll probably go 90mm black on black. That's what I wanted too. I might be willing to go a second color if people show interest.

Why did you make an exclusive if you made them better, there'd be no need for it. (see hummie)

I actually wanted to get them in 83mm for a smaller build and without trucks and without wheels, just the motor+urethane.
The motor was 155$ shipped before, now I cant get it under 300$.

I'll post videos when I get the latest ones with the better stator.

@zeno - I might be able to offer the 83mm option if you really want it.

@Lizardking0069 - I'll see if I can get it down more. Will let you know.

Good to know. Have 83mm on my current board and don't really see the need to go bigger. Someone mentioned there's not a lot if urethane on the 83, wondering why that would actually be a problem.

Depending on where you ride, 90mm on hubs is helpful against cracks on the road, rocks, gravel etc. If all you ever ride on is smooth, flat roads 83mm is fine.

I have custom built hub motor, Kegel's on sk3, exactly 10mm urethane. The problem is that the rubber on my drive wheel worns out much faster than the others. But maybe thats with every 1 wheel drive e-board? Don't have anything to compare.
