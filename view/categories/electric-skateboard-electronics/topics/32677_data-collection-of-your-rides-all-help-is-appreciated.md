Hey guys,

Recently I've wanted to get more information on what all the other builds are getting as a max power output. Mainly because I'm fast approaching the point where I'll have to start ordering Li-ion Cells (LG HG2) for my Frankenstein build. So as the physical part of the build is coming to an end, and I need to start buying the electrical components I wanted a better feel of what the general power draw is based on weight and motors. So if you would kindly take 1 minute and dump your basic info here in [this Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rysa_QX3nfE6u9G9ICfYHyn8bOEvFiRioIKk9vbp7g4/edit?usp=sharing), that would be greatly appreciated. 

Info on Doc:
-Max Power Draw
-Avr Power Draw
-Dual or Single
-Top Speed (flat)
-Motor Specs (Size (ex. 6374)/KV/brand)
-Weight of Driver + Board (KG)
-Notes (What ever you want to add just stick it here

Thanks for taking the time to send some help my way
