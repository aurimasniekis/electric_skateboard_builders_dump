So it took months and research upon research and multiple ideas. However I have finally finished the model and have a working prototype for proof of concept. I am curious as to weather or not there is any interest in this and will upload photos once I get some feedback! This Ronny knowledge has never been done before and while removing a bad cell was previously an issue and this is no longer the case, the best part is that the battery can be shrunk or expanded to allow for more range or even more voltage

The only issue I was having was weather or not to open source it or not and if so just post on a thread or some other way to make it available, it's not limited to skateboards but bikes also or even scooters maybe. Recvommendations from someone who's done this before?

If I open source I'll release schematics first along with the solid works files, then I might sell prebuilt packs, not trying to be stingy with the photos but once it's out there I won't have the option so I want to make sure

I will be keeping it open source but will first do beta tests of the final product as I will also be selling finalized packs for those who don't wanna build them @onloop @rwxr would it interest either  of u to be beta testers?

Ps: to everyone checking out this thread sorry to tease but the pronto has been finalized however I will be doing a few beta testers in the coming week or month to test the product and once it's been thoroughly tested to the point where I believe it's safe to release to u guys I will post it up right here(stay tuned!!)

@willpark16 I really appreciate the offer. However, I think there are people on here that are better suited to do the beta testing. People with proper equipment to test all of the aspects of a battery.

I really like the idea of this battery and I will be following the development closely. If the prototype and the tests turn out good, It will surely change a lot in eskating. Keep up the good work and big props for going open source!

Cheers!

Can't exactly go too much into detail yet about that but it's capable of being a smaller pack and building a 10s 4p for example right after u get off the plane. Also I will keep the first iteration packs at 10 and 12s since those are the top two

Honestly, open source is the best way for the community. Look at the badwolf mod for example. That opened the door to all matters of other GT2B mods, which improved upon and fixed the problems with the badwolf mod.

If you want to really profit on it, open source will make it harder. However, people will still buy your batteries due to the need of equipment that most people don't have. Even though I've open sourced my app and the BT modules, I've still sold about 25 of them. Some will do it themselves, and donate though also. So it all works out. Your just not going to make big bucks if you open source it.

i come from the 3d printing community where everything is open source and open hardware (except for they who shall not be named who rhyme with "baker rot"), so this sort of secrecy and "how do i sell this" mentality is really weird for me

the way to "Sell" it is to open source the design but perfect the process of making the printed bits on your own, at some point you'll master it and can sell your services of taking cells from people and enclosing them and sending them back to folks. It isn't as easy as just keeping your design closed source and selling the parts but it's much better in the long run and you'll get a lot more business through an open source model

I can tell you I am an advocate for open sourcing this, but will be a first customer purchasing it from you as I have no skillz there lol. In fact have an extreme need for this for a US to EU trip in a month where I have not decided on esk8 transport option. If this would work, I am game to be an early customer.

After you sell one, it will be open source and someone will most likely improve upon it. 

Either way, interested in seeing this as I've been looking at modular packs and have a few ideas of how to accomplish it on my next build.

@caustin @evoheyax @Eboostin @osbor thanks for the advice and I think that open sourcing is going to help better this community, since most of what I know came from people contributing I think it is only fair I do the same. The schematics and files will be uploaded as soon as the 1st design is finalized I am not the best with solidworks so that is taking me a bit longer. Hopefully in a week tho, the parts for the new batteries will be ordered friday and will take about a week!!

Let's see some previous work and your working prototype. 

This concept is very easy on paper- but making a battery that can have cells added to it in series and parallel and making it reliable when strapped on the bottom of a skateboard is difficult. Remember having a modular pack means that pretty much nothing can be glued or taped down which is the main reason battery packs usually break. Adding a bms further complicates the process by adding wires that most people have no clue how to wire. Also, if you change the voltage you will need to change the BMS unless youre basing the BMS off of a 12s. No offense @willpark16 but ive never seen you build a pack let alone a pack like this.

Please be careful with this. Don't market it as safe for travel. I have a solid idea of how youre going to construct this as there arent many correct ways to do it. You dont want to set a plane on fire my dude. Make sure the work is SOLID.

Just because i dont want to see a plane get set on fire- let me review your designs before you release this stuff.

Ive made some modular pack designs (not actually made) and there is a way to do it and make it fool proof and safe.

misunderstood that then, well I appreciate the criticsm and it will be able to be safe for air travel so long as each pack is under 99wh, but I will probably not advertise it like this just because of liability. I think we can talk about a way to develop the designs but will need u to pm me

Edit: Safety requires patience, but if anyone doesn't believe I have managed to do this thats a fair statement and one that they are entitled to believe. For those who are willing to wait however I can't wait to relaese the finalized and tested product in the upcoming weeks/months.

i'm going to guess he's hesitant to show a WIP design that could potentially be dangerous and someone could copy the WIP version and run into issues involving fire.

it's understandable to wait until the design is good enough before open sourcing it.

This sounds very interesting.. too bad we can't see pics right now, but I support you in the way you want to make sure it works before you release it. I had a similar idea but with the balance cables coming out of each pack and a final negative and positive pack, but you'd have to wire it yourself.

If you did 1s4p packs and had BMSs in each, that would be a good idea but you'd have to find a way to charge them all at once. And there aren't many (if not any) 1s BMSs that can do 60a continuous.

Very excited, good luck

Not sarcasm. You said you weren't posting pics for safety reasons. 

You are not liable for someone's actions if they see your pics then try to do it themselves, was my point. 

If you are not posting for other reasons, that's fine but safety shouldn't be one of them otherwise this forum wouldn't exist. This forum is proceed at your own risk.

Obviously there is some interest in this new battery pack and I have been trying to be kind, however I will just take the next few weeks and finalize the design then rather than open source patent it and sell them myself and make a nice profit. I wanted to offer this as a gift to the community however the current feedback of rudeness won't be tolerated and if it proceeds I'll have a mod close this thread

yes well, this is the internet, need to have a bit of a shell, and your response to prodding is sometimes just as telling as the prodding itself. 

although to be honest 99% of my interest in this design is because it sounded like a no-weld design using magnets or compression or springs or something, but you mentioned it'll still involve some spot welding so...
```

Magents were believed to get too hot and become unusable at the discharge rates we use them for, there is in fact compression however! The spot welding is a part of the original design but will most likely be removed if this new method works. Either way it will have three upsides, voltage increase or decrease, airplane travel ability for those who would do that(won't be advertised this way) and the ability to remove old cells to replace with new ones in minutes

I understand this is vague rn but Im currently short a lot of cash to fund this project and the parts I do have im waiting for. I am aiming to retail some packs that are safe for travel through an airport with zero issues while also posting the designs so they are available for modification by others

Don't market this as being air travel safe. Unless you have a Air Transport Certification, it is not worth the marketing.

If there is a BMS for each cell, what happens when the pack as a whole is shorted.

Well it's not idiot proof if that's what you mean but i believe the bms should protect it from short circuit. Only more research and tests can give u a solid answer though

10 BMS units and each must be able to push 60amps.. well that sounds expensive

I don't know what to make of this honestly. 

You're saying each pack has a BMS, but they're all connected in series. And the BMS i bypassed? If so, then it shouldn't balance the cells because you seem to have connected the charging leads with the discharge leads? That's what I assume because on the last picture it looks like each battery only has two leads.

Is the BMS variable? What happens if I want to go from 12S to 6S? 

> 30a is possible though, basically u sacrifice current

Ok, but amps(current) isn't really something you can sacrifice very much of and still have a functional board...

Read your original post then look at your prototype. Does it look like anything you described in it? No
That's why a lot of people give you crap. You described the holy grail in your post and then presented nothing special. I think @Eboosted has a better solution so far and he didn't make the claims you did.  

Modular pack with removable cells: I don't see a way for you to remove anything but groups of cells.
Bad cell goes out: you still have to replace modules which are more than one cell. 
Removable BMS: I'm not even going to entertain this one

I didn't say this was all I had I said this was all I had pictures of currently but I'm in no rush if you wanna follow the thread then do so if not then oh well. As for eboosted I made that design months ago he only made it faster because he was able to afford all the parts at once. (I mean no disrespect to u @Eboosted) I went for a redesign to make the charging more like that of a rechargeable drill. I'm not really here to entertain this is for people who have a bit more of a broader view though I do wish I had taken more photos before switching designs and such the final product will be done as soon as I can afford parts not all of us have money on demand for this sport. The bms I have currently is 6s which I do have photos of if you want to see but I'm now upgrading the pack to 10s so once I get the money the first thing I'm ordering is a bms and some connnectors to at least be able to do a test run. I can assure you however that the only thing slowing me down from finishing this is money and a research paper on cell regrowth

@Eboosted has had a working modular pack in his reaper since before you started this thread, his splits in 5 I believe. I've had a modilar pack in my gfs board since December but hers only splits in 2 for charging. 

It's not because we have all the money in the world. It's because it's really not all that spectacular...

A true fully modular pack like the one you described in your first post has never been done. Not even by you even though you said you had a working prototype which we have seen nothing about.

Are Tesla style packs designed to have cells individually replaceable?

When a cell goes bad, can't you just replace the fuse write and reload the new cell?

Seems to be a lot cheaper than having a BMS for each cell.

I looked into doing modular packs awhile back and spoke to Dr. something on ES who made several videos of all the cool electric stuff he has made.  He said if I had a little knowldge of how an BMS works and some soldering skills I could take apart some BMS and use a CAN bus to connect the different packs for LV and HV cutoffs and + and - for charging.  I didnt have the time or the skills at the time.  I still think it is a great idea to make an almost idot proof and replaceable packs.  My concept was to have a main compartment with BMS (brain), some sort of RX, and a VESC or two.  This would let you add packs via CAN bus and power for 6s up to 12s. If one of pack goes bad the others would still work to get you where you need to go and not have to repalce the entire battery.  Maybe too ambitious for the time and I didnt know enough about how everything works. Hope something becomes of your idea, either way you will have learned something.

The most appealing, idiot proof battery I have seen is the Ligo battery that Grin Technologies recently released. They are pricing at $140 for a 10S1P and only 10A continuous discharge but has some neat features.

I think its just a bms with a thin module for bluetooth and led connection. but yes I agree this is also the closest I have seen and I think 10a is good enough if you do 10s 3p we dont use much current anyways

Yes, I read that also and is very cool with bluetooth com and potted cells as well.  I didnt get as far as costing the idea out which may have stopped me as well if it was out of reach or didnt make sense.  Right now I have a 10s3p with all the bells a whistles for 300.  The modular pack at 420.00 didnt make sense for my stiff bamboo board, however I am making a hybrid mountainboard and street carver with a flexible trampa deck and modular is the only way I want to do this. I was thinking about making 5 2s3p packs for my space , bought the batteries and now have to figureout what to do.

Thats great - so is the plan to put a full BMS in each pack.

Here is what I found a while back.  Adaptto BMS is a modular bms that can be attached to each pack, would have to make something like this that can be broken into individual boards.

and this is what I posted on ES
