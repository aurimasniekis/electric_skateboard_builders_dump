im having a problem with my gt2b remote. i recently got a vesc and before that i had an esc. whenever i trigger the remote about 10% it goes to full speed. previously on my esc the remote didnt do that, it only go full speed if i hit the full throttle now with my vesc it goes full speed with very little amount triggered on the remote
