Here is my board finally working reliably now goes ok to be fair needs more power now to 36v 
Will the two 18v batteries running together only give me 4 mile range ?![image|281x500](upload://p77OEvH9Rik79a0nhos7KbJe88g.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://1BLxXqVhBunzFaSFmkceZuvGlki.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://1SkZINpP9KGw54kZxuYcsNegLtI.jpeg)

Voltage has nothing to do with range. It is all about capacity. However, the more batteries you have the further your board will go.

Get you like 5 or 6 of those 18v packs and you could.

Theoretically you can go as far as you want, just chuck a few of those drill batteries in a backpack and ride off into the sunset!

This is an interesting swapping battery solution that I’m surprised no one has yet to fully attempt. 

How hard is it to replace the cells in these?  How many could fit? 

Or rather 

How hard would it be to mimic or find the manufacturer that creates the casing and charge units for these power drills? This has really got me thinking. Ganna make a separate thread for this.

You won't need a thread, they are 18650's inside, every brand uses a different cell. There's thingverse holders available and many people have done this. Just do a search.
