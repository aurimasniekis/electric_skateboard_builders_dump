Hello guys, how are you all?

I want know why my motor stop working when I'm climbing.
Happens two times already...I was running, and suddenly the motor "turn off" I couldn't control with my remote, i turn off and next turn on, my remote and nothing.. I turn off the safty cutoff from my board and put it again and nothing... after a 2/3 min is start working :).

the second time it was the same thing....

I thing is when I climb in full power the board turn off, because I climb the same hill, but the second time I was running slower, and nothing  happened.

Do you know How I can fix?

More information on your set up will be needed.
I'd have no idea how to solve this but I'd imagine knowing motor kv, battery,  and vesc settings would be important to know for someone knowledgeable enough to solve this.

It sounds like your BMS is cutting into protection mode, but we need more information.

Or vesc is throttled because of heat?

I had the same problem when i put my remote on fast/high mode and tried to accelerate too quickly. I lowered my battery max to 40A. Problem solved. But like @Skunk said, more information on your set up will be needed
