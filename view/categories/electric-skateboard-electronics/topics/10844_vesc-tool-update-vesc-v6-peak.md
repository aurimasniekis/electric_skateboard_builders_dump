Maybe I missed it, but why will single drives be more beastly on VESC 6 than 4?

V6 will handle much higher constant current, similar to what we get from an ezrun pro esc. V6 has direct fets which will allow us to pull heat away from the VESC much more efficiently and use more power on one esc rather than splitting our output into two separate circuits and drives.

I can't remember, but will it allow also us to push the ERPM limit a little higher? I know many that have set it around 60,000 for added protection.

Yes, Vedder has stated that we will be able to use very high kv and use the vesc for many other applications. Exciting times!

It depends on what you are trying to accomplish. V4.xx works great in a dual drive configuration but you may want to wait for v6 if you want a powerful single drive. V6 is definitely going to be more expensive due to the added manufacturing time and machining cost for the enclosure  but it is also relatively untested. I cant say for certain how reliable it is until we build a few and abuse them.
