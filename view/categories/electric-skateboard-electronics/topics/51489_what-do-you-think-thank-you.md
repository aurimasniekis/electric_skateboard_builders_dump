But are these specs per motor or for both together? For what max Amp is your BMS rated? Motor Max and Min sounds about alright (quite powerful). Got this from a mate. Running the Max currently at 60A which is sooo powerful compared to my previous setting.

I don’t know the specs of the focbox on top of my head (google may help). A post has to be at least 10 characters long otherwise you can’t submit it
