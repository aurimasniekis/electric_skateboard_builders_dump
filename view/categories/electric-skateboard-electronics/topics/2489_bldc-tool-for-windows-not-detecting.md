Is anyone else having problems with the latest BLDC tool for windows?  

I just noticed today that when I go to the Motor Configuration tab and the BLDC side-tab, then hit the Start Detection button - the motor spins up as always, but in the window to the right where it says, "detection results will be printed here"  nothing appears and no error messages are generated, or it generates an error message, "Bad detection results received".  This is 3 different VESC's and 3 different motors.

All VESC's are running version 1.16 of the firmware.

Am I the only one seeing this or is it a bug in this version of the tool?

Thanks,

DougM
