ROFL! üòÅüòÅ
@stefik58. There are tons of build threads on here with a lot of information.  You should do some more research before trying to get such broad stroke answers.

1.  Read and research what others have done (not done)

2.  What range/speed do you want (done)

3.  What is the budget?

4.  What is your skill level with DIY/what tools do you have access to.

5.  Find a similar build that someone has done and has a good explanatory thread that you can model after.

6.  Start a build thread


7. A bunch of other steps.

Although I am sure it is possible, 200$ is gonna be pretty difficult. At that point, you main as well just spend 400 to get a rebuild like meepo or something. My build, although it is a bit crazy, is ~1400$. Maybe either spend a little more money or just go for something prebuilt. It is difficult to get a non-motorized good longboard for less than 200.

The real crazy thing is $1400 is not that crazy.

very true! I have seen people in the upwards of $2000's. It would be super cool to have a board like that, and someday hopefully when I graduate collage and have money, I will, but that is just insane! It would be awesome making one of the fully offload boards with 4WD and independent suspension. Those things are pretty bonkers!

@stefik58 If I were you, I'd check out this article. It has some pretty good advice.
