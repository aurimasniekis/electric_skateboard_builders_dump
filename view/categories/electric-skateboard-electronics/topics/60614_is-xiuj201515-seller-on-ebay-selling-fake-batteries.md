So I recently bought 48 batteries from this seller on eBay. When I went through to voltage check them one did not even read and 7 of the other ones had significant lower voltage than the others. I contacted them on eBay but have not heard back. I decided to inspect one to make sure it was real. Under the shrink wrap the battery had no markings. If I could get some figuring if this out that would be great. 
Here is a photo of the profile on eBay. ![image|230x500](upload://b1wpYdFWY34dvlADcSQDqZmt8j0.jpg)

you didn't state the brand either way if there name brand like Sony,Samsung,Panasonic or  LG they will have printed or stamped numbers and or letters possibly even a barcode on the metal casing of the battery. this is put there by the manufacturers to keep track of battery's before there sleeve is put on. now its different with cheap unbranded battery's they do everything sleazy possible to save a penny including lying about mah/ah max rating, using thinner wrapper's, thinner casings and even saving a penny on ink. in my honest opinion stay away from cheap battery's there not worth the risk of fire or injury.

post some photo's if you can also have you tried charging them then testing them. they may have sat in the warehouse or the sellers place long enough to fully/partially discharge.

From the outside they look good, but that doesnt mean too much. i bought mine from a reputable source not on ebay. But that variation of voltage shouldnt be and the dead one is suspicious.
Mine came all precise 3.38v
Where are you from? Europe/Asia/US?

Always look at the reputation of a seller. This one has a habit of selling fake products and is generally described as dishonoust.

Most certainly fake without a doubt.

Totally agree! 

Personally I would never risk buying unknown cells from an unknown source, not a part of a build you can really cut costs and be safe

Why buy something as dangerous as a battery/cell from an unknown source? One bad cell is enough to burn down your home.

you can have countless negative reviews, yet still have a ''positive'' rating. That's ebay for you. Always read the negative reviews.
