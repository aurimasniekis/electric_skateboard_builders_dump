Could anyone give a comment if [this BMS](https://www.aliexpress.com/item-img/12S-30A-li-ion-48-1V-BMS-PCM-battery-protection-board-bms-pcm-for-electric-bike/32380916723.html#) would work with mij 12S3P lipo's?

It says it's a li-ion BMS, would it work safely with my lipo's?
I will only use it for charging and not for discharging.

If you are only using it for charging you could get a 12s 5/10/20a BMS. It will be cheaper and you don't have to use the BMS for discharging, so the amperage won't matter.

I just haven't found those on aliexpress. Only for 12S 36V battery's.. Not for 50.4 volt charging.

Well the 40a one will work, but if you can find a lower amp you may be able to save some money
