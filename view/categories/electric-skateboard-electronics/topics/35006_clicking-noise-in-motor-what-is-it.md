motor is making a noise, it seems to be happening at a specific spot.

the right motor is the one with the problem.  left motor is good, spun it to compare.

any thoughts?

A magnet has become unfastened from the inside of the motor ... maybe? ?

pull it apart, have a look, just be careful not to slam the bell together when you put it back...

I've had this same issue with multiple TB motors. First one they replaced after months of back and forth. Second I opened up to see what the problem was. It was loose magnets and loose retainer clip. The third one they were going to replace but they decided to just take my money, motor, and then ignore me. I now buy motors from elsewhere.
