After my initial [prototype](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/custom-vesc-controller-prototype/1073/2) I finally worked out the bugs and got version two working.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/568d92f8e07583b74e91bd312b9bde7a5cafc186.JPG" width="666" height="500">

After seeing the GT2b from @FLATLINEcustoms I knew that that design was the ultimate one, unfortunately I asked him to share the step files to modify it but until this date he didn't.  As editing STL files is a pain in the a** I recreated the design from scratch using Fusion 360, but I'm terrible at CAD designs and could not recreate the chamfers and few details that make his work much better. 

Functionalities: 
The remote use xbee radio to connect to another micro controller that handle the received data. I decided not connect the xbee directly to VESC's because I'm planing to add more stuff to the receiver, like GPS, LED's etc... So I don't want to create a bunch of custom applications on VESC.

The remote has 3 buttons, one is a cruise control, the other two can handle multiple or single clicks to different functionalities, for now: turn on and off lights, change mode from rabbit to turtle.

Few more pictures of the design, and build process

As you can see the controller uses teensy-lc as the micro controller and a ST7735 based lcd to display information. I'll put the files on thing-verse together with the firmware of the remote, I can definitely help however wants to reproduce this but you need to have basic knowledge of electronics, I can not explain how to wire a potentiometer

Yeap... 

Next step is to create a PCB and also design the trigger part to be 3d printed, I'm still using the trigger assembly removed from the gb2b controller. I'll also test using nrf24l01+ radios because xbee's are way to expensive, 23 bucks each, but they are very very reliable. 
Another problem is that nrf24l01 will need to share the SPI of the arduino*, not sure if the libraries (for the lcd and the radio) are already handle that, if not, I'm not very interested on updating them to make it happen, and I will leave xbee radios on the final version.

Yeah... I'll share, but I was planing to share once I have the pcb done (for the receiver and the remote). I'll start working on that tonight and I'm estimating two weeks to get it done. If you guys want the hacked version schematics I can do that too.

ops.... thanks! :)  rabbit and turtle are two different modes with different acceleration. Rabbit will push whatever throttle you give on the trigger, while turtle will slow down the acceleration.

I don't think I'll have time to try it before several weeks. If you route a PCB, I'll wait for that.
I still have to complete my "simple" GT2b.

I did not know the teensy microcontroler, there are some many out there now !!
Have you written your code in C or arduino-like ?

Anyway, great stuff here !!

arduino language is actually C with custom functions to access the hardware of the atmega microcontroller. Teensy is a arduino compatible micro, but the specs are much much better, form factor, speed, etc... But for the final version I think I'll stick with the atmega328 with the arduino bootloader.

I'm still not sure about the LCD size, 1.8" is cool, but it may be too big?

@vitormhenrique

Thanks for the informations. I have played a bit with the arduinos ... (nano and uno mainly).

I guess that the main constrain is the ergonomy of the controler in your hand.
Does it fit well with this big screen ?
I have not yet tried the original version of Flatline but I am a bit worried that my hand is too small for this big design.

And the controller still fell good, I need to improve the design a little bit and increase the chanfers to get closer to @FLATLINEcustoms design.

Due to the very good feedback I'm already working on the final version, I'll test few different radios on the first PCB, including the nrf24l01, some lora radios and maybe bluetooth.... 

I spend the last two nights learning how to design a more organic form using the sculpturing part of fusion 360, I'm pretty pleased with the new design...

The curves are much more smooth and it should have much better grip on the hand....

I'm working on the final design and the PCB.... 
I ordered a bunch of different components and different radio modules..

My goal is to design a controller that is reliable, I started the pcb design and will be testing few radio units this weekend.

I also have a friend that is mechanical engineer and very good with cad and industrial design, today we will have a session and try to finalize the design.

Once I finish the pcb, I'll order from OSHPark and test it out, if it proves to work as the prototype, I'll share the code, design and pcb. 

@Eboostin this is already a potentiometer version :stuck_out_tongue: as the thrigger is connected to a potentiometer but I see what you mean, you want a slide potentiometer... I'll only consider that after finishing this version.

Hi, very nice work you did there!

I've also made a remote similar to yours.

I've created my own PCB that includes a charger for 18650 lithium battery, arduino nano, adafruit screen and bluetooth HC-05.
I don't use any GT2B or anything else.

The receiver is another arduino with bluetooth module.

PM me, maybe we could do something even nicer!

I'll release the code and other files when everything will be finalized. 

In the meantime, I suggest that you look at serial communication between two arduinos.
The addition of bluetooth is simple, because it's the same thing as having a wire between the two arduinos, except it's wireless :stuck_out_tongue:

Here are some links:

Code for the Adafruit screen is given by them, so it's also pretty straightforward. I've managed to make it running in less than 10 minutes.

Quick update!

Things were a little slow on the development, due to few issues, mainlyI had my electric skateboard stolen, so I did not had anything else to test and I wanted to ride a sk8, I had no spare VESC and I prioritized building a new esk8 first, and you guys know how difficult is to get VESC's especially. So I finally got to a point that my esk8 is working, few minor things to add but I can work on both the remote and my esk8 at the same time.

Pictures of the new ride....

Definetly a very interesting project, now if I only had a VESC lol. You might want to look into using a ESP8266 module for the wireless communication as well, the normal model has two GPIO's which you could use to communicate with the receiver, but you may need more GPIO's to communicate with the VESC. The ESP8266 ESP-03 has 7 GPIO's so I think that would definitely be enough. This would eliminate the need of having a second microcontroller on the board.

Only disadvantage with the ESP8266 is that it consumes around 100mah when Wifi is active. No problem for the board side but a bit much for the remotes battery.I recommend to use UDP as communication protocoll. And the Wemos mini D1 is very very nice and small device. Cheap as well.

Good point @Ackmaniac, I've actually heard it can draw a lot more current, around 500mA so that would suck lol. I think then the HC-05 Bluetooth module would be a better idea because I'm pretty sure it draws far less current.

Actually I just found [this](http://bbs.espressif.com/viewtopic.php?t=133) article that highlights ESP current draw and it seems like working current would be more around 120mA because it's not like it's going to be transmitting a lot of data. And if you can fit, let's say a 1.5Ah battery in the remote then you would get around 12 hours of battery life, which is pretty good considering an average board only has a battery that would last around an hour.

What hardware are you using on the VESC side?  Are you connected via PWM or I2C slave (i.e. the Nunchuck interface)

Has there been anymore progress on this project? I'd like to see if I could get it one to work with the Torque Rocket Dual.

This is what jason @EnertionSupport should be doing . Make an upgrade vesrion to the vescx remote . I would buy it in a heart beat . Bet everyone else will to . Like evolve sells an upgraded lcd one for for 120$.

I'm working on it currently. Search ultimate vesc controller with OLED. Still prototyping though.
