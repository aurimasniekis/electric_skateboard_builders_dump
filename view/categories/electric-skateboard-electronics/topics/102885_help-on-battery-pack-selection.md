Hi everyone!!

I'm new to DIY eskate, I just bought some parts from flipsky @aliexpress recently.

Dual FSESC4.20 Plus (Based on VESC ) x1

BLDC Belt Motor 6354 190KV 2450W x2

So I have a few questions to ask related to the battery pack.

1) Can I buy 10s2p for my build instead of 10s4p, its 10s2p enough current for vesc or I should go for 10s3p/10s4p?
2) choice for 18650 battery( cheaper is better), I'm from Malaysia so most of the parts I can get from aliexpress.

I need some guidance and recommendations for my build.

Thank you.
