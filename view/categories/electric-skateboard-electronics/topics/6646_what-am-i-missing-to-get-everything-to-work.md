Hey guys, so no i have most of the parts but i  need to know what am i missing in order for everything to work?

I have the board and the wheels etc...

For the electronic part i have

190kv dual motor (/w motor mount) 15t/36t
x2 Vesc
CANBUS
watt meter
10s LiPo (x2 5s 5.5mm Bullet-connector)
XT60 Harness (for series wiring)
 
and i am thinking about a BMS, but what do i need to buy to link all of this together? and what am i missing? do i have the correct connectors?

a charger that can charge batteries in parallel?
a remote?
enclosure?

I've heard charging in parallel is very dangerous? isn't it better to just charge separately? and remote i am now looking into and enclosure i am going to custom make.

Was just wondering what sort of connectors i needed and wires etc

Buy a parallel charging board, plug your 2 batteries in, make sure you have the right setting on your charger, charge. If you do it right, there wont be any problems. Always stay near your batteries when they are charging.

Hey guys,

I was wondering what is the best connector type. The LiPo batteries i am ordering have 5.5mm bullet connectors but i find the XT60/XT90 to be more common, from series connectors to parallel chargers and so on. 

but i am wondering if 5.5mm Connectors are better or what are the benefits between them as i see many LiPo batteries with 5.5mm connectors.

Also what do you guys think of adapters. I found some 5.5mm bullet to XT90 adapters so you don't have to solder, but do you think they would work? or are there some incompatibilities?
```

## \#20 Posted by: Raf Posted at: 2016-07-27T09:42:24.951Z Reads: 97

okay, that what i was planning on doing, gonna have to solder the XT90 connectors on to the batteries as they come with 5.5mm connecters.

Do you think a 5.5mm Bullet to XT90 adapter could work instead?
```

It would work, but why not practise your soldering? It may also add resistance, and another connector that could wiggle free.

EDIT: Make sure you get the 5.5mm connectors with a full circle where the wire goes in, not a half circle where the wire is soldered on top.

Hakko fx888d is a really good station to get started with. That is what I have and I am still a beginner. If you don't want to learn to solder, you could use the adapter. It is a very good skill to have and I have a long way to go before I am good at it. Practise makes perfect.

You can use an anti spark loop plug or an anti-spark switch. A BMS with an e-switch works too.

The charge board should work, just make sure your plug everything in correctly. You can have both anti-spark switch and another on/off switch, but I'm not sure why you'd want to.

I use a much cheaper soldering station, Aoyue 469. Not on the same level as the Hakko, and it's not digital, but it's a fairly decent unit. Especially for $30. 

Also, don't forget to pick up shrink tube, adhesive backed velcro, jumper cables, power source to program your VESC, Cable clamps/clips, and some 1/8" adhesive foam padding. Always helps to have those around.

And watch some youtube videos on soldering. It's not hard and you'll be glad you learned this skill as now you don't depend on pre-made adapters, wires with a pre-set length, nothing. Also order a solder sucker for desoldering. Comes in handy.

@Jinra @Mrmoonlight @mcfly777

At the moment i have these item for the setup...

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/ebe6a4e6de62e0d445b8f873ea4ae5a6cc3c847d.png" width="404" height="420">

I am going to order the VESC from DIY

And I've ordered a soldering station from amazon.

All i think I'm missing is the controller/reciever and enclosure right? or is there more?

Its actually beneficial to have both. The resistor in the anti spark loop will limit the sudden rush of current when the switch is flipped on, making the capicitors in your esc and the mosfets in your switch last longer. The soft switches we all buy should really have a resistor built in, this is why the mosfets fail "on" so often.
```

Yea but he said "anti spark switch" which already acts as an on/off switch.

Yea it acts like a switch but if you take one apart they actually have zero anti spark functionality. The mosfets just open up and then it's as if the switch was just a standard wire. There is a load from the capacitors on the esc so there is a quick high amp load and this wears out the mosfets and caps. Either wire in a resitor to the switch, or use a loop key between the battery and soft switch.
```

You sure about that? It seems weird to me, that a device called "anti spark switch" would have no anti spark features, and would be damaged by doing the thing it was designed to do. Wouldn't R1/R2 be the resistors?

I know for a fact im right about the high in rush current https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-charge . And i know for a fact i've had 2 out of 3 mosfets in my own vedder switch fail because of it. I'll have to look at the circuit later tonight more in depth but i dont remember seeing a resistor when i took the physical board apart i had at home.

No questions is a stupid question.. Volt meters in my opinion are necessary, it tells you when the battery is going to die, before the VESC/ esc does, so it allows got to get slowed down before you come to a grinding stop. (Not sure if vesc does this). I also find it useful to tell me about how much more riding I can get in before the battery died.

I am wondering if a Watt/Volt mater is necessary for the board and what is it used for? sorry if this is a stupid question. I know it can measure the watts/volts whilst riding, but with a VESC cant you set a max input so that the volts will only go to a certain amount. Or is this used to find out what that amount is?

I took another look at the circuit there is no resistor connecting the input line. The resistors you see are just passive components.
