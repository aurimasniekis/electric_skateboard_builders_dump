Hello,
i messed up my focbox bootloaders and will now need to use an st-link v2 to manually upload the bootloader and execute a fw update.
As i have no time and no experience with st link i am looking for someone in EU (preferably in Belgium) who could help me with that. 
It becomes urgent as i should receive the final parts for my build this week and would really like to ride my new toy as from next week at latest. 
Thanks in advance!
