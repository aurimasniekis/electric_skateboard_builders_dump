Building a Dual Drive Skateboard can be very expensive also maybe not required for some riders who weigh less & don't have many hills to climb.... so to save some money the best thing you can do is go single drive!

**Well....Now you can build an absolute weapon of a single drive with the NEW R-SPEC 6372 Motors.**

SPECS:
800 grams
63mm diameter
72mm length
190KV

@CSN @sk8ace

Jason said 1.5 r-spec's, and an r-spec is just over 100 USD... so I bet you are looking somewhere around 150-160, maybe even a little more.

With just a beast single setup, you can save money by only buying buying **one** esc, **one** mounting system, a **lighter board** overall, and possibly have better efficiency-  The efficiency point might not apply as much for this r-spec, but I'd still bet that it is better than having two original r-specs; just maybe not by much...

I've gone with single motor setups on all my boards, ranging from a 6s single 50mm build, to a 10s r-spec build. Now, you have to realize I'm only 16 and 140 pounds, so single motors are just fine for me- even the 6355 r-spec is fine running in a single config. I also don' have any hills (florida life) so I don't need to worry about that either... 

The main things to take into account is that a dual motor build (despite what people say) will not go faster than if you just had one motor geared the same: the dual motors advantage is just having **more torque** for **faster acceleration**, which leads to **better uphill performance**, and the ability to **carry more weight**.

*So, bottom line*: If you live in a hilly area, or just want super awesome acceleration and performance, than dual motors are for you. 

**BUT**, this new r-spec seems like the perfect middle ground between single and dual, if you are wavering in between: so if you think single would be fine for you, but you know you want more performance than one motor can offer, this might be a good option for you. 

That said I think the turnigy 6374 190kv is around 80+shipping, so this may end up being close to double the price of that... Granted though the turnigy doesn't have a keyway, the wires are super stiff, and it isn't built to the quality of the r-specs, I still think it might end up being a better deal for those on a budget. 

Basically, if you were thinking of getting a dual config, and you don't really need it than **this will save you money** 

if you were going single motor config, than for an extra 50ish usd you can have a board that is *way* better than what you'd achieve with a single r-spec- again, worth the extra in my mind.

It's only not worth it if you don't need it, or are trying to build a cheap board (which could backfire on you in the long run)...

haha, a lot of reading, I know... hope it helps though!

and check out TB's new 63mm motors.

If the big R-spec is too expensive then can get two of these for the same price.

Nice long shaft for wider belts and keyway etc. Plus it's sensor'd.

yep- 230kv is higher though, so it would take more gearing down if you were running 10s or 12s: it is basically the same as the original r-spec, just with a longer shaft, higher kv, and it's sensored.

The r-specs biggest flaw is its price...

yep, it is. Torqueboard's esc is also compatible. I haven't actually tried a sensored setup, so I can't give any feedback on that :smile:

Thanks for the replies! So much to think about hah. The order was already placed so I am getting one or the other no matter what. I would need to know the price and send the difference before he ships the smaller motor. (If the price is competitive).  My area is pretty hilly.. It seems I would be better off with the bigger r spec for now.

if it hasn't shipped, I'm pretty sure you can cancel with no penalty.. then, when the bigger r-spec comes out, you can either re-order the smaller one, or order the bigger one.

Don't need a longer shaft, the 12mm wide belt & pulley fits on this shaft perfectly - Any wider then 12mm and the motor mount is forced into a position on the truck hanger that isn't completely square (the truck hanger starts to taper away around the bushings mount) this prevents a true 90 degree / perfect alignment of the motor mount - Basically it makes the mount sit at a very slight angle which introduces alignment and clamping problems and will also affect torque transfer and, therefore, counteracts any of the benefits you would get by having 15mm belts. As you know proper alignment and high clamping strength are critical.

In fact, even a 9mm wide belt is ok in single drive applications, but for the heavier guys, 90kg+, and for those that want maximum performance the 12mm belt offers a 33% increase in acceleration & braking torque.

In terms of how it performs, I haven't built a single drive eboard yet (ever).... so ill let you know. I expect it to be pretty good. It's fairly flat where I live now so maybe ill ride it.... I am very interested to know if a single drive is more / less energy efficient. 

**What I do know is the maths in terms of how much you can save.**

*Assuming you have the trucks and wheels* 

**DUAL DRIVE**
2x VESC = ($169ea) $338
2x R-SPEC 6355 = ($159.95ea) $319
2x MOTOR MOUNTS = $359
TOTAL = $1016 for dual drive eboard components

**MONO DRIVE**
1x VESC = $169
1x R-SPEC 6372 = $219.95
1x MOTOR MOUNT = $179.95
TOTAL = $568.9 for mono drive eboard components


Dollars saved = $447.1
Mono Drive is 44% more affordable.

In terms of Max Rated Torque Transfer a dual drive with 9mm belts is double the equivalent mono drive with a 9mm belt - Meaning a 50% reduction in torque transferred to the wheels in a mono drive.

With the NEW R-SPEC 6372 Combined with a 12mm Wide Belt (which offers 33% increase in torque transfer) a Mono Drive is now only a 17% reduction in Max Torque Transfer when compared to a Dual Drive.

**The question is, do you spend 44% more to get a Dual Drive to increase torque transfer rates by just 17%?**

*There are some other advantages of DD to consider, such as no torque steering/braking, traction, brake force, etc*

ALSO, In terms of acceleration, the ability to transfer more torque is only useful if the motor outputs more torque! So that is why combining the 12mm wide belt/pulleys with the 6372 R-SPEC makes a lot of sense. It outputs more torque! The 6372 R-SPEC is 30% longer than the 6355 R-SPEC - It has a longer stator, longer magnets & more copper it can produce more torque output at any RPM and it can also handle higher current.

@onloop
Don't understand why a 12mm belt should increase the torque by 33%.
I think it can handle motors with more torque where the 9mm will get destroyed, but I don't see why the torque with the same motor should be higher. Maybe you can explain it more in detail.

@jakeyb2525
You say you can't use a 12mm belt on your 6374 motor. Why?

I'm using a Turnigy SK3 6374, they have a shorter motor shaft so its harder to mount a 15mm wide pulley, i've not tried 12mm 

Diy & Enertion's motors have longer shafts so you can run a wider pulley & belt.

Oh, I see. Sorry for the noob question, but that means that the currently used 9mm belt will "lose spin" (don't know if the word has the right english meaning) with a motor like the 6372 or his little brother, when you accelerate to fast?
When this is correct is the attrition high so that one should change the belts often?

Edit.: Do you know a roughly date when the 12mm one will be in the store?

If you have one motor I highly recommend wider belts, if you have two motors with 9mm wide belts (which is all that will fit) technically you have a total of 18mm wide belt. Two motors is always better than one - but just more expensive.... It was my goal to maximise the performance of a single drive eboard.

Hi Guys,

I have the same motor and I have some questions.
I installed 10s2P battery that can give 40A continuous but I don't know why te current of the motor is different and more High than the current can drain the battery.

Then having this motor and this battery setup some of you know what are the maximum values in the current limits of this configuration that I can put without problems in the BLDC tool? (Motor max, Motor min (regen), Batt max, Batt min (region) and absolute max.

 Best regards.
Rutx

You can fit a 15mm wide belt on a sk3 motor ,..depends on what mount you use<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/d/8d61113ea1c9d7bc1c260f0a6c80a074864f2e87.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/8/e8b2fa1ff1ecb903b9c548d738514f2f38f903fc.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Out of curiosity, going with a new improved R-Spec2.0, why not make the openings a little smaller to help keep dirt and debris out? Has that not really been an issue you've experienced with the previous R-Spec or is the cooling benefits outweighing the desire for that change?

I wouldn't want a board with nothing less than 15mm belts, thats just me tho. 9mm belts is too narrow for my taste, 12mm belts are harder to find in various sizes. 15mm belts can last forever and there are tons of different manufacturers who make 15mm belts in all sorts of sizes, they are simply way easier to find in stock.

I have the r-spec 190kv 6372 motor (the larger one)
now that the old motors aren't anymore in production, what can be a good replacement for that one so i can make my long a dual motor? (1 in front and 1 back the board)

what´s your setup? You can´t see something!
I assume you got a FVT 6s and the green thing could be a 6s Multistar lipo?

First of all don´t throw a lipo around like that. Treat them like little kittens or they´ll bring you some magic smoke ;)
You´re using a 190Kv 15/36 drivetrain with a shitty 3s multistar battery.
Here´s a calculator to see what´s going on:
