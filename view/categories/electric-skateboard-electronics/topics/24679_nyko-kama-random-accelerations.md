Ok...so my Kama remote/board will every so often begin randomly accelerating on its own. This typically happens after a hard acceleration or high speed. Has anyone else had this happen? Is there a solution? Wheb it does occur, I can tap the brakes and cutoff the acceleration by sending a new signal. Therefore, I'm assuming it's an interference issue, and definitely not safe. I've nearly died a few times.....ðŸ˜‚

All help is appreciated because I love the remote otherwise!!

the kama had some known issues which is why most people have stopped using them.
a replacement is coming soon, get yourself a mini remote till then!!

You are getting dropouts.  I got this even when after i soldered the board directly to the ESC.

Get a gt2b and call it day/

Hmm :/ ya

As bad as it sounds, I have gotten use to the accelerations. I am not sure what happened with you, but when I feel the board accelarating on its own I tap the brake to send a new signal and it stops. I am to the point that I can do it almost instantly...I just love the feeling of the Kama..

No, I don't want to ruin the housing on the board knowing my solder skills :smile:

Did this work for you?
