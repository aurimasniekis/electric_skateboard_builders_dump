Hi guys,

I'm trying to decide what battery pack will fit best for me.

So I put my options on here below. You can see Wh/ euro but also how many km a battery will bring me for the euros spent. 

Daily commute is around 11 km but I like to have 20 km as a minimum so I can also travel around my city and surroundings.

Lipo batteries are significantly cheaper but on the downside, they are a bit heavier. I've read in the post about Lipo vs Li-Ion that Li-Ion theoretically has 3x the lifespan of a Lipo, does anyone have experience with this?
Are Li-Ions worth the cost?

I'm leaning towards lipos because of the initial cheap cost.

The prices of the Li-Ion packs are from @pjotr47 btw. 

**Wh**
Samsung 30q
10s 3p = 1.85 wh/ Euro

10s 4p = 1.88 wh/Euro

Zippy flightmax 5Ah 25c = 2.67 wh/Euro


**Lipo** 
19.85 km = 75 euro 12s1p Zippy 5Ah 25c
39.7 km = 150 euro 12s2p Zippy 5Ah 25c 2.74kg

**Li-Ion**
19.31  km =  140 euro 10s2p Samsung 30q

28.97 km = 175 euro 10s3p Samsung 30q

38.62 km = 230 euro 10s4p Samsung 30q 1.92kg

My experience with lipos is that if you can connect them to a bms you are golden. Once they have reached the end of theyâ€™re life span, you can easily replace them and keep your bms since they are plug and play. But those are just my thoughts

I have 2 lipo powered boards and 3 li ion.  The 2 lipo boards have had 2 battery swaps in 2 years due to failure with age and the li ion ones are all still going strong for about a 18 months and a year respectively with no discernible deterioration whereas the lipo's do drop off significantly as they age.  
imo li ion is a better solution for longevity and ease of use but each to their own I guess.
