Does anyone have any images of this battery and case on a build? [This one](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-10s3p/) They sent me an image, but it's a little too small to make out details.

My google-fu is failing me, thanks!

Mainly just confirming width and height and just the way it looks/quality. I want to do a basic mockup on my board to make sure I have enough room for turning and such. They told me it was 21" by 30mm in height.
