Hello,

I want to make a 10s4p battery but unfortunately in my country (Argentina) the BMS is not reached to load / download the package correctly.
It occurred to me if it is possible to divide the package into two of 5s2p each with a [5-cell BMS](https://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-717305700-placa-proteccion-bms-para-345-baterias-li-ion-18650-100a-_JM) and put it in parallel to turn it into a 10s4p one.
Is it possible? Would it work well?

P.D: The load would be carried out by placing two independent ports in the enclosure.

I mean, yeah i think it will work. Just draw a diagram and triple check each path for shorts
