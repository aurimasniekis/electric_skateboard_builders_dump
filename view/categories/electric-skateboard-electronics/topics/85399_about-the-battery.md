Oh wow here we go.

Short answer: NO

Pouches expand, not good for a flexible board. Also it's aliexpress so I can almost guarantee you it is crap. I would never ever ever buy a battery from aliexpress. The battery is the component you absolutely **can not** skimp on

I can get a 12 pack of these delivered to the UK for 99¬£ (less than postage of a normal battery!)

I doubt the lifespan would be great but value wise I can see the appeal!

how bad could these really be?
