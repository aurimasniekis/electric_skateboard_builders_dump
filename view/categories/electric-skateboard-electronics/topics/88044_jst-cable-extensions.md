Hey guys- waiting on an order of extension cables... if I get a longer cable with a male end, can I solder those 5 or 6 cables to the cut end of the original cable and make it longer? I donâ€™t see why not but wanted to ask before I made a boo boo

Yes you can. 

Pro tip: stagger your cuts /solder joints so they don't all line up. Keeps overall cable width down and chance fit failure.

I just got a matching male to female adapter and added it on the end with liquid electric tape for security
