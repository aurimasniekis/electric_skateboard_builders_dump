I have decided to also get a Trampa mountainboard.
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-mountain-board-buy-or-build/72702

The monster battery box they use states an internal available space for the battery of 205 x 190mm.
I have played a little with the layout and so far I have come up with this

![image|639x500](upload://7cBICOHXTUBIRBngm0DNvOeR9Qt.png) 

While using these nickel strips which would mean I could reduce the number of the spot welds. 

![image|500x500](upload://qTb3Qi4z5yAhk6YpLBxil6XRtJP.jpeg) ![image|500x500]

I believe the slit on the strip should be on the center of battery and should not be as shown in the picture.

This would leave me with enough space for a [charge only bms](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/BMS-6S-7S-8S-9S-10S-11S-12S-13S-4-2V-25A-Adjustable-BMS-Lithium-Li/32931097519.html?spm=a2g0s.13010208.99999999.260.56b73c00zLmCUZ) , a [charging port](https://eskating.eu/product/dc-in-battery-2-1mm-socket-with-dust-cover/) plus all the required wiring and connectors.
I have drawn the batteries with a diameter of 19mm (samsung 30q datasheet states 18.3mm) so I should have enough space to put fishpaper between the p groups.

What do you think?

If you have an EU source for pure nickel 10mm x 0.15mm strips, fishpaper and heat shrink I would appreciate it.
nkon seems to be out of stock for all of these items.

are you sure the messurements are the inside messurements?
i couldn´t find that on the website.
the thing is, that the two vescs also mounted inside of the box which will take some space too.

just out of interest, why you don´t want to go with lipos for which this box was desinged?

I got the dimensions from Trampa's site.

![image|690x462](upload://gdtCr5B2WcxlhJMTzAIiuB0QOdg.jpeg) 

HRB lipos would cost me originally 580€ and probably over 750€ after import taxes.
Hobbyking lipos would cost around 300€ but then I would only have 12.4Ah
The 30Qs would cost 310€ + nickel strips + heat shrink etc = around 350€ and I would have a 21Ah pack of a higher quality compared to lipo.
I could try and fit my 6S 5000mAh batteries from my RC helis but will have to measure them to see if they fit.
Two are thunder power 

http://file.espritmodel.com/battery/tp/tp5000pp65c.jpg

and the other two are turnigy

With the 18650 pack I would include a bms in the battery box so I could use one of the chargers I have for my current board instead of my charging station or the Graupner charger trampa supplies.

:see_no_evil: ok sometimes i have tomatos on my eyes.... :joy:
i was only reading the discription and there wasn´t written if it is usable space.

makes totally sense what you planning!
just don´t forget to add some damping material to your calculation too.
i mean like neopren tape or similar.

For charge and discharge

For charge only you can go with the bestech d140

No I bought mine from bestech directly and they delivered really quick. Was like 20€ plus shipping. The thing is that you need to order min. 2 of them. Honestly it’s always good to have a spare bms at home 😅 or you can just ask here if somebody want to order with you. I‘m sure you not the only one whos looking for a 12a charge only bms.

30Q cells ordered from nkon.nl along with the nickel strips I linked above and some oversize 350mm heat shrink I hope I can make fit.
nkon is out of stock for most types of fish paper, nickel strips and heat shrink so I ordered all the other items I need from eskating.eu.
The malectrics spot welder is already on its way and the Trampa board will be here next Monday :sunglasses:
Now I just have to find a BMS and I will have everything I need to build the battery.

Board is here, batteries just came in, the spot welder is lost somewhere in the German post system :disappointed: and a second one is on the way, BMS is on the way from the USA
The vendor that I ordered the fishpaper and such as usual has not shipped anything yet :roll_eyes:.

My RC heli batteries don't fit in the monster box so I tried the board with only a pair of 6s 5000mAh. As you can imagine I just got a feel for it since I did not want to damage them.

Now, since space is really tight to fit a 12S7P in the monster box, I am considering not using fish paper between the p groups and using superglue. The pack layout will be the one shown in my initial post.

The things I do for love (errr, esk8 :laughing:)
I did not have a big 3s battery for the spot welder, so I had two options:
Connect in parallel my 5pcs 3S 1300mAh batteries or repurpose a 6S 5000mAh that had one dead cell.

![20181115_090817|666x500](upload://less0RHjhR7LlVxOFxktCIxl4iN.jpeg)

What is the thickness of your fish paper? And how tight does it need to bend? I think you could use some kind of plastic sheet as replacement. It just needs to be abrasion resistant. I think fire resistance of insulatoros is overrated as once the cells start to burn ain't nothing stopping it.

Fish paper is not meant to be fire resistant. As you said it just needs to be abrasion resistant.
It is not that thick, I have not measured it but I guess 0.2-0.4mm.

Fishpaper is meant to be more abrasion resistant than most plastics while not being abrasive itself. This is especially true when vibrating against other things could cause a rubbing action and wear through plastics.

Fishpaper is not meant to be fire retardant. It is simply a very good insulator that is free of any conductive particles, has very good abrasion resistance, can absorb small amounts of moisture and is foldable/easy to conform around electronics.

Why different nickel?
If you swap the last two 7p groups like this 
![image|525x500](upload://56TZi33yL7WMT6SKz4Zo50jRd2G.jpeg) 
You just need one connected soldered with 2x12awg wire to the other packs.
You still have enough space than for the bms.

![image|598x499](upload://fUPaHtnFF2j5JwqqzvWJ151Js2u.png) 

I could put the cells not staggered like I have them now but I would need this type of nickel strip.

Sorry 😅 but I still don’t get it.
You don’t need to change anything in the nickle lay out.
Just one side of the 2s7p group has only one nickel stripe, plus you need to connect this pack with 2x 12awg to the other ones.
No need to change the layout of the cells to quadratic scheme.

Yes why not?
Just use some foam or neoprene to fill the gaps and you should be good to go.
Why you think you should need to change the layout? 
The only advantage I can see in the quadratic lay out would be that you have a bit more air inbetween which gives more oportunity to cool down the cells. But I think that’s not really a big issue.

I have enough space to make it like in the photo, even with fish paper between the p groups.

I just asked if I could skip using it but in the end I have enough space to use fish paper and even if I did not I would rearrange the pack in order to use it.

First thing: welds looks very clean. Good job

Do you gonna put your battery under your board? Or in a case on your board? If so watch out with those nickel strips. I think they can hit the other packs if you place it in a flexible enclosure ![image|390x500](upload://xFvzJCrMzaaqnTCL5mpTRe80wOZ.jpeg)

They will be placed as they are in a Trampa monster box. It will be a whole "brick" and all the p groups are held together with hot glue between them.
There is a photo somewhere up in my thread that shows approximately how they will be placed in the box.

Technically it is two Lipo batteries.
I tried with one at first but I could not get solid welds when testing nickel to nickel.
Nickel to battery was fine but I am too anal to let these things pass.
So I sacrificed another 6s 5000mAh battery to make 2 more 3s.

I have another question concerning the BMS (Bestech D140 12S)
I will use it as a charge only, so the load will not be connected to the P(-).
Before I plug in the balance cables, I have to connect the B(-) correct?

![image|544x500](upload://zqjjX5n5hTx8HSYH6PZUZAiEjkR.jpeg) 

Also it seems I must not connect the B(-) balance wire, is that correct?
It seems strange they would include a pin that should not be used.

## \#44 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-11-22T10:26:07.030Z Reads: 143

```
Take a multimeter and measure the resistance between B- and the first pin. 
It’s 0ohm, means they both connected via pcb intern. That’s why you don’t need to wire up the first balance pin from the jst plug.

Looking good, wish my welds were this clean

For less work you could completely skip one of the parallel connections on each group, doing it only at the ends of the battery, they aren’t/shouldn’t be carrying any current anyway, and having them doubled does no improve current handling

You would not believe what gave me grief. The freaking heat shrink.
Nkon did not have the size i wanted in stock so I got a huge one that tried to make it work.
It did after 2 failed attempts and my OCD compels me to change it at the first opportunity.
Now that is see all that empty space I think I should have gone for a 12s8p or 9p. :joy:

```
I know that and for the D140 there is continuity between the B(-) and the first pin.
However I have read about a lot of BMSs going up in smoke if the balance leads are connected before the B(-).
Connecting the B(-) separately ensures that even if I connect the balance connectors in the wrong order, I will not damage the BMS.
I am not sure about that but since the manufacturer suggests that way of connecting, I figured it would be better to follow his instructions.

I didn’t said anything about the connection order.
Just that the B- is connected via pcb with pin b- pin and that this is the reason why it doesn’t need to be wired. What you can also see in the schematics

if the bms has only positive on the balance leads, there's no chance of short circuit or anything
so it doesn't matter on bestech bmms or d140 what comes first

What do you mean by only positive?
As long as you have difference in potential there is always a chance of a short circuit.

I would like your opinion on the series connections.
Right now I have 7 x  8mmx0.15mm strips between p groups.
I am aware of the various tables concerning nickel strip ampacity and according to this post in endless sphere my series connections are good for 7x5A=35A.
https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=68005

My objection lies in the fact that according to my logs my battery sees currents over that value only for a few seconds.

Do you think I should double my nickel strips on the series connections?

So right now you have 7 layers of 8mm wide and 1.5mm thick nickel strip?

According to the table from es it would be like 7*7a so 49a in total.
But i‘m not sure if you draw 49a for a full discharge cycle.
I think the values from es are for constant current.
I‘m sure 7 layers of 0.15 nickle can handle more current for peaks of 15-60sec.

That is my thinking too. Looking at my metr logs from my other board the time I spend above 35A is very small usually only 5-10sec.

Look at the battery builds with cell level fusing.
There people use even very thin copper wires for each cell. So this slim wires can handle like 15-20A for peaks without to burn out.
If to compair your 7 nickle strips to it I think you don’t need to worry with your 80-100A peaks max.

By the way, would you mind to share with us how you managed to get your motors run cool?
If I remember right you had some issues in the beginning that they overheat very fast.

@taz
I hope you mean 0.15mm because 1.5mm is really thick.

From what I know 1 nickel strip that is 10mm X 0.15mm should be able to handle 15A and 20A for a really short time.
That means 1 nickel strip that is 8mm X 0.15mm should be able to handle 12A? (15A*0.8) 0.8 because 8mm is 80% of 10mm.

I think I finally solved it today.
After many unsuccessful attempts from lowering currents, taking out the v-ring to reduce friction, printing motor fans and reducing gearing the problem was that one of the bullets for each motor was barely inserted.

I only managed to test it for 10-15min but I used some really steep hills that I would normally not try to get up on a board and the motors did not overheat.

@trampa has been really helpful through all this and checking the phase wires was actually his first suggestion.

The thing is that there is no real information about that. I couldn’t find any real tests or data sheets to it. If somebody has something like this for nickel strips than i would be happy to get it linked.
The thing is that the max current a nickel strip can handle also depend on the length of the strip itself. Same like with a silicone awg wire. The constant values for silicon wires are usually give for a specific length. The shorter, the more current they can handle.

If a 10mm 0.15 nickel strip could really just handle 15a for a short time I think companies like nkon wouldn’t sell 35a rated cells with 8x0.15 nickel taps welded on

if your worried about heat, just add some copper cable on the strip, since you have 7 layers it wont heat up the cell at all while your soldering it, especially if you put solder blobs and let it cool down and then just touch it so the cable sinks in the solder

I have been doing that on my 12s6p packs, I put 5 layers of 10x0.15mm nickel and 2x 2mm2 copper cable per series connection that's around 50A only from the copper from a chart that I just found online
but lets say its more 30A or so just to be safe

Maybe add a temp sensor to one series connection and see the max temperature, IMO this is too much work and if your super paranoid add some more nickel/copper

I was looking a bit more around because of the nickel strips.
Here is a test with 12mm 0.15 nickle.
The test ramping up to 28a and the strip get up to 51degree after 3min of load
https://youtu.be/xwzVra9WvVQ

If now to calculate that one of your strips will see max 15a for some seconds... 🤷‍♂️

Hello Taz.

I really like your battery build, going to build a 12s7p myself and now looking for components, welder and to learn how to do it according to best practices.

I have a concern regarding the picture with the discharge cables.
The discharge cables are soldered on the nickel strip at only one point of the strip.

From what I understand this will make all battery current flow through the last nickle strip and not be divided as between the series connections.

As an example lets say you put max 70A "battery amp", then the 70A will be divided between the 3 and 4 cells around the connection point like 30A and 40A depending on how the resistance divide it. 
In the series connection with 7 strips there would be 70A/7 = 10A each.

Am i wrong with my assumption?

Other than that i think the build is looking great, will copy a lot of your work!

You are not wrong.
If you look closely you will see there is more than one nickel strip on the first and last parallel groups.

Sick build. Did this come stock or did you make it, or can u order it? This would have saved me so much heartache !

Sorry, the divider. I didn’t see on site. Maybe I am a dumb.
