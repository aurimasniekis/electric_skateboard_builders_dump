Hi Chaos,
I'd suggest reading through the builds and any other posts that look of interest. You'll soon close down some of your questions and get an idea of what you need.

There are multiple battery options depending on what your preferences are concerning performance and convenience. 
To help steer you in the right direction:
With a Vesc and 190kv motor you will do well with a 10s battery. Good performance with dependability. 
10s meaning 10 cell in series for 36-42 volts. 
The simplest way is to get 2 5s Lipo packs and connect them in series and charge them with a hobby balance charger.

You'll need a high voltage high amperage E-switch or an anti-spark connector.
