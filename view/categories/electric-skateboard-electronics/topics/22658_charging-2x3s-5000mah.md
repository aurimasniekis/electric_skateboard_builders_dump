parallel charging Lipos is not the best option anyway.
You can charge them in series since most hobby chargers will charge 6s.
For a 5000mah battery, it's best to charge at 5a which is a 1C charge rate.
Just get an adapter harness that does 2x3s to 6s for the balance wires.

which wire is cut off?
The middle black wire is not really needed so if it is cut off, no problem.

This is the easiest solution. You can charge without removing anything. This connector handles charging as well as balance wires.

Ok I received one of these to charge. To use it I would have the batteries in series then have what type of plug to run one to the vesc and one to the port.

That connector only hooks to the batteries, not to the vesc. I suggest also ordering the MEB power switch and everything will wire together perfectly.

For example would I connect it from a series plug or a parrallel plug.

It would be a parallel connector up there/XT60 splitter. This would work as it is pretty much the same thing I am using on my board.
