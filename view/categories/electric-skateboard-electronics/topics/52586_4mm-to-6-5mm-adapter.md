Is there an adapter that allows me to plug the 4mm motor (SK3 - 6374) leads into the 6.5mm bullets on my Max6 esc?

 i dont wanna solder wires if i can get away with it.. i found this (https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/3pcs-4mm-Female-to-6-5mm-Male-plug-ESC-No-wire-adapter-for-Motor-Brushless/222616797524?epid=2213437151&hash=item33d4fec154:g:M3YAAOSwo4pYLslC), Anyone with similar  options?

Maybe you can find some copper tube that's the right diameter to make a sleeve?
I'd do it right and solder if it were me though...

@scepterr will do any 4 mm adapter to any other bullet mm size.

If you're not comfortable soldering, and you really should learn to solder if you're DIYing electronics, you could always post in some local forum/facebook group (marketplace or local yardsale group) , "Hey I have these connectors I need changed, any competent solderers want to it for $10?" It'll only take 5 min if they are in fact a competent solderer.

Highly recommend you just soldering 4mm's instead of using adapters.
