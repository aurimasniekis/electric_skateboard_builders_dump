Hello,

I am currently building my first esk8 ever. I think I've read a lot about it by now so I decided to put some affordable parts together. I just want to be sure it will work together and maybe hear some improvements to make it work even better. I am not sure if it deserves its own thread but I will try :) .

So as an ESC I've chosen [this one](https://www.banggood.com/2436V-Dual-Motors-System-Driver-Noninductive-Longboard-Skateboard-Controller-Remote-ESC-Substitute-p-1381109.html?rmmds=search&ID=516800&cur_warehouse=CN), mainly because of price and simplicity. Do you have any experience with it?

I want to make a dual-drive that would perform great in a hilly area. That's why I would choose [this motor](https://www.banggood.com/BRH6355-140KV-Brushless-Motor-For-Electric-Scooter-Skateboard-DIY-Kit-p-1464905.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN). The same motor is available also in 220kv version. What do you think? Which one would be better? 140 or 220kv? Isn't 140kv overkill a bit? I've read somewhere,  that optimum for belt drive is around 170-270kv. I just desire it would handle some hills with my weight (80kg). If it would be able to hit 30 km/h it would be great though.

My next question is about the battery. I would like to build a 10S4P battery pack from [these](https://www.nkon.nl/rechargeable/li-ion/18650-size/k-tech-inr18650p-2500mah.html) cells. They are super cheap and that way I would get 50 amps discharge rate I guess. Do you think it is ok to use them with the ESC and motors I mentioned above, or should I buy batteries with higher discharge rate?

And the last question ... the BMS ... Would [this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32875971231.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.304343c8FvdBP7&algo_pvid=e4e3bf04-ace3-457d-bba0-9ff007fa943d&algo_expid=e4e3bf04-ace3-457d-bba0-9ff007fa943d-0&btsid=0ce1a2d5-748a-4ddb-9d6a-c58d06f6f5cb&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_6,searchweb201603_52) BMS work with my battery and ESC?  I would like to buy the 60A version with a separate charge/discharge port. 

I am looking forward to your answers :slight_smile:

I have a similar ESC with remote controller that I can give it to you $20. I'm basically giving it away for free as the $20 is to cover the shipping fee and my time to go to the post office. Mine does not come with a battery meter though(battery meter on ebay is like $5). One word of warning is that since this ESC is not programmable the acceleration and braking aren't very smooth.
