Hi, I was thinking about buying a factory built electric skateboard like these.

They are pretty cheap and has a good top speed and range. But will they last for long?

Does anyone know if I could build a better for a little bit more or cheaper? And if so what parts should I use?

Thanks

Search search and then search some more. Obviously we're all building them for a reason. There are hundreds of threads dedicated to "is diy right for you" or "intro guide to diy"
