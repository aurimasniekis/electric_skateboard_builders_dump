Hey so I've been looking at the prices for buying in bulk from Trampa on the VESC 6 and if we can organize a group buy of at least 10, we can get them for $275 (including shipping to one address, so the shipping from there to each buyer would be about ~$10 give or take.  This is pretty good considering just one on its own would be $341 shipped.  ($325 + $16 shipping).  So anytime else interested in signing up for a group buy of the new VESC 6 for $275 + shipping?  I'd add one of those polls, but I don't know how to yet, lol.

I'm afraid you cannot start a group buy before you are a level 3 for security reasons @treenutter

Yes you are correct here, unless another forum member wishes to help coordinate this, you will have to spend a bit more time on the forum :slight_smile:

Oh, well that's fine, honestly I didn't want to be in charge of any group buy, I just wanted to put this out there and hoped someone would take charge and set one up!

I posted a TSG group buy but I think it will sink since interest has been low recently.

Would be happy to set up a group buy for VESC 6 since I live in the UK and reckon shipping would be cheaper to me (but prob balanced out by being more expensive to others across the pond). 

My hesitance is that I don't think people have builds that require the extremes that the VESC 6 allows for.

Well I think it's at least worth a shot... I've read through so many forum discussions here where people are talking about really wanting them, but they just can't justify paying almost $400 for one, so if we can get them at that price point, then that's really only a bit more expensive then the high end VESC's a lot of us already use, so I really think it'll work.

I'm going to be building my dream board starting now and for the next few months.  The VESC was one item I have really been hesitant about and doing the most research over and I don't see how I could build my dream board without these VESC 6's.  I might end up getting 4, eventually so I can have a 4WD Carvon with V4's.  Until then, I'll have dual V4's and I want the VESC 6 running then!

Don't mistake my hesitance for disapproval, I think we should go for it and I was just voicing concern. Money saved is always a must in this hobby.

Awesome, so you think you'll be able to set something up then?

I would wait, there are other manufacturers that are just about to release new, and most likely better, versions of the VESC 6.  They will be significantly cheaper too.

I'd be happy to help out where needed but as others have pointed out it is probably best to wait a bit.

If you're eager I can get one sorted considering I think you can get the cheap prices with 10 VESCs, yes?

How much do you charge for your ESC?  Will the final product have a aluminum heatsink or something similar to the VESC 6?  I didn't realize others were derby) developing ESC's for the 6th.  Obviously now that makes since, given there are so many options for them running 4.12.

It's not mine... its @stewii VESC6. Price? I paid $160 and bought (2). Please just PM him :)

That thread has the STL file for the housing. We were going to get it CNC aluminum milled by @Kug3lis but he has too many projects going on I guess. I sent the housing to 3dhubs.com -- they will print and send me (2) for about $25 + $4 shipping. I guess that would bring my total outlay on them to about  $350 for (2).

The cases would be made by my father not me. I am just a middleman :D Next week he is getting a new CNC machine so production would be way better and quality also better. Just at the moment, there are preparation jobs to get CNC installed in the workshop.

We are still just working out the details of potentially sourcing from a PCBA house... since admittedly hand soldering the VESC6 is time consuming (seriously a steal for what @stewii is charging). Assuming things work out,  I predict 3 weeks to a month for units to arrive at people's doors. If something turns up, I'll see if arranging a group by with one of the regulars is possible. We'll need a higher order quantity for the prices to be reasonable.

Maybe ... likely but i think @Kug3lis will mill them for us from the stl files that @stewii has provided.

I mean the vescs are very close to identical but if they are off by a few millimeters it would be annoying. The dimensions on the casing you linked aren't on their website

Currently reaching out to my PCBA contacts from both the US and China. Hopefully a decent price estimate turns up.
