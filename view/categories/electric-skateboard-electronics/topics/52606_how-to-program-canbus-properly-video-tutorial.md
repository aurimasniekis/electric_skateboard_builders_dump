Some people are afraid of CanBus. But there's little to fear in my opinion. I have used this method to setup many many ESC's and never have had a Can chip failure.

Important Notes:
- If canbus is connected, always power both ESCS together
- If you run Canbus, ensure your power wires are taped, or solid connections and that they will never come apart from vibrations.

Enjoy 12 minutes of the most boring s*** on the planet.

Definitely a helpful video. I had read the several how to connect via can threads but seeing it in a video is always nicer.

The only reason why people are afraid to use the CANbus connection is because of possible ground loop or short. Correctly designed circuits never have this issue.

Here’s a video from Miami electric skateboard that does a good job going through the setup. 
His other videos are good as well.

It’s mostly following the wizard in the vesc tool.
