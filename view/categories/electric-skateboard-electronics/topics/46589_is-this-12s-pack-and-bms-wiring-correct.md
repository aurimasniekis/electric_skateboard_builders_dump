So I am reasonable certain that I have everything correct but I need someone to review this before I go forward and start assembling the pack. Is there anything wrong with the pack or the BMS wiring according to the schematic below?

For a 6s2p pack. Would you need a 12s bms? I cant really find them, so 2x 6s bms is the answer?

No. You need a 6s charger
