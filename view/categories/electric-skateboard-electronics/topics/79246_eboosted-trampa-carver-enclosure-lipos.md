Anyone had any luck or know any lipos that may fit in it? Kinda ran out of space so I'm tempted to run a few lipos for a 12s setup in it.

Don't care much about the mah, just needs to fit.

I should be able to split them if needed.

You can flat out nearly every lipo.
Or get the dimensions on the trampa website and just look for 2s lipos which will fit the hight and length. Length shouldnâ€™t be a big issue.

Small rooms = 7x16x2

Already had a few Turnigy packs splitted and put in only been able to fit a single 6s pack in the lower big one :/ Damn hard to find anything that fits and hobbykings website is a solid pain in the but to find information and slow.

Yap hk is super Slow...
But all dimensions always written in the specs of each lipo. Together with the weight etc.

Yeah for some reason the information page is blank on some of the lipos.

Currently looking at 3S lipos maybe theres hope in a few of those.

Gonna be a pain to solder up to a BMS though.

@ 2" depth you can go 2s maybe 3s. I dont have my lipos in front of me to measure. @ work. 2 lipos in each small room and maybe 5 or 6 in the big room.

Yeah looks like 2S may fit.

This looks like it may fit in tight.

Go for something @least 5000mah and 40-50c. My 12s made from 5600mah 50c 2s packs are lacking in range (6-7miles) but the power it transfers into is amazing. What's your setup?

Yeah i was really hoping to find some 5500mahs since thats the turnigy ones i have they should be ideal for what i need.

My setup is just a pair of 6354 145KV 15/66 gearing 125mm gummies with some dual focboxes.

Original plan was to do a 12s4p 30Q setup but if i do that i have no room for a BMS at all.

Just from looking @ the enclosure, with 2s, you could get away with 12s2 and a lot of running wire lol. I'm not 3s would fit but if they do, you can do 12s3 and a lot of running wire.

Need a lot of amps though, i was thinking about 12s3p 30Q but thats only 60A.

Main reason why im trying to go with lipos, its not made to go for long rides but more to be a simple power house that recks everything else at grouprides haha.

May have found the perfect option.

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-1s-20c-lipoly-single-cell.html

With these i can do 2x1S per 4.2CM that should allow me to use just shy of half of the enclosure so plenty of room for the BMS and wires.

That would give me 100A output (50 per motor) 5000mah thats about 10km per charge as well. (Not really alot but hey power)

Sorry but that doesnâ€™t fit together.
If you want a powerhouse than I wouldnâ€™t start below 60c @5Ah. So with this packs you would need as min 3p.

I cant really use 300amps though, everything in my setup is rated at max 50a per side.

The 100A i would get out of the other would be cutting it at exactly my max safe amp usage.

I would recommend you to read a bit about lipos before you decide which one you will buy.
The thing is, c-rating isnâ€™t a normed unit.
What that means? There is no standard which defines what is 1c. 
With this said your calculation c rating* capacity is max continues current is also not true.
I promise you with a 20c cell @5Ah you will have a horrible sag from 20a per motor, maybe even more early. This will also shorten the cycle live of your cells etc. etc.

So in fact, every lipo producer can write what ever c-rating they want on there lipos.
The only thing you can barley believe, is that with higher c-rating the cells also better. 
The past has shown, if you use quality cells you can calculate 1/3 to 1/2 of what you get with your calculations as true continues current.

Letâ€™s look
5Ah*60c= 300a so in best case 150a means 75a per motor or good that you have some headed room to the max limit of your cells.

@J0ker3366 is that so ok?
Need to continue epoxing ðŸ˜…ðŸ™ˆ

Yeah I know, this lipo thing won't be a permanent thing that's also why I don't care much about mah but more concerned with the size.

It's more an I need power, small size, and a working board now if it sags and runs like shit after the first mile that's "okay" since my plan is just to take it out to have some fun once or twice with a few mates to see how well it fairs.

Shipping the enclosure to my place in China and leaving it for the people in a battery factory to hook it up with some 30Qs when I'm down there or VTs and letting a different place optimize the enclosure for more room.

But that's not in a solid 3 months so while I would love to wait I have to try it out :P Can't have a trampa here and just look at it.

Just get you six 5000mah or above, 40c minimum but no lower, 2s lipos. Wired all in series for12s1. It'll give you all the power you need and 6-8 miles depending on how aggressive you ride.
