So i have been trying to get my board right but my sk3 6374 kept coming apart and being wiggely untell the point where you can't use it i have tried changing the screws (m3) because they kept breaking or wiggling lose to the point where it damaged the screws holes and I tried replacing them with lock tight and it still didint work, are there any other motors I could use that are better I'm using a vescx rn so if theres a motor witch is bigger than the 6374 that it could run it's be cool

SK3 are some of the best motors out there, just make sure all the screws are tight,...if not add Loctite and re-tighten.

Only other thing you can try would be to is use a 5mm Tap and redo threads one size bigger , new 5mm bolts and use Loctite.

If you try this ,take motor apart not to get any metal chips in motor.
