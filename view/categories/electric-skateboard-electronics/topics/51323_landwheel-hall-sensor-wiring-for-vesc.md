Today I tried to connect the landwheel hub motors on a dual setup with maytech vescâ€˜s.
Just in case someone want to do the same
here is the wiring i figure out from left to right.

The blue cable is not needed.

 1        2         3         4         5          6   

5V | empty | hall1 | hall2 | hall 3 | GND |

Hi @Luke23

Did you use sensored FOC mode with that connection?

@esk8jpn,
 we are testing bldc hybrid mode with the landwheel hubâ€˜s right now. 
I heard itâ€™s not the best idea to run foc on the maytech vescs ðŸ¤” 
Maybe we try later an check the pcb temperature in foc mode.
