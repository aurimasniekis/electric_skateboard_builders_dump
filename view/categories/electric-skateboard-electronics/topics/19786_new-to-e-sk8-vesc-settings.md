On my current setup I have a Space cell Pro 4 10s4p battery, a single enertion r-spec 190kv motor (the larger one designed for single motor setups), and an ollin board vesc. 

Questions:
-What settings should I input into my bldc tool? 
-How do you calculate the numbers to input?

This has been covered multiple times.
Please do your research, read build logs and check the [VESC FAQ](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/search?q=vesc%20faq).

Come back if you hav specific questions or problems.
