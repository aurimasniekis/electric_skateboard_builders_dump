That esc can only handle 6s so it is probably going into some type of failsafe. At 6s that esc will be asked to pull a lot of amps so you will want to be very careful when accelerating or going up any kind of grade/hill.


Looks like that esc doesn't have any brakes in the programing either, any particular reason why you chose it?

Thats not the right type of esc for this application.
It might be easier trying to figure out what is wrong with your vesc.

Because the help center at hobby king said that even though it's a 6s they said that it should be fine knowing my motor won't pull that much.
