Alright, I've been reading quite a bit about this but I haven't found anyone who's run this setup and reported back. I'm building (rebuilding) my old setup and due to some lapses in initial judgement I have been going on a 13s design. That is to say 149KV sk3, 13s3p q30 battery, vesc 4.12 from torque and a Vedder Antispark Switch. 

I have gotten the very clear sense that 13s is risky due to voltage spikes nuking the drv chip on the vesc. At this point I want to stick with the 13s for science and to see if we can't push some boundaries.
What I am hoping to collect here are the improvements that can be made, whilst keeping the 13s, to ensure the best possible reliability. My approach to this is to minimize the chance of voltage spikes at all. And to understand how they occur.

I have read that a TVS Diode across a the battery inputs will help. Can anyone detail this some more? Specs on the diode? I'm guessing one with 60v brake down voltage but what about quiescent current and power rating? This sounds similar to ESD protection setups I've heard about.  
Along the same.lines I've heard of adding more caps across the battery terminal on the vesc? 
Another topic is braking. It sounds like braking is when the voltage spikes occur. Is there a way to perhaps set up the firmware such that I retain some braking but reduce back EMF spikes? 

A definite possibility for me is to move to the vesc 6 or any other esc (esk8 specific preferably). From my understanding that vesc 6 is also only recommended at 12s. But still rated for 60v in theory. Is this a much safer option? Does this or any other esc have the hardware that protects from spikes?

From what I understand even 12s is pushing it on 4 hardware if you are running in FOC anywhere near 50amps.

You might be able to do what you describe running in BLDC, but I doubt it. This is almost certainly a path to melted VESCs.

Not really, this is just a bad idea. It it's known for not being able to handle it's rated capacity and you are planning to go over this. Nobody else is commenting because they don't want to touch this with an insulated 9 foot pole.

Fair enough. Thanks for the input. Nothing's built yet. I'm still working on the campus cruiser for a friend. Sounds like I'll just cut my losses on the charger and BMS and go for 12s.

My Darth Maul has been runing almost 3 years wuth 12s4p, no issues related with FOC as 12s.

My Trampa 12s4p has been runing for over 1.5 years on v4.12 and FOC, not a single issue

My Sidekick 12s5p has been runing for 8 months pushing the shot out of the system, VESCs are 100% perfect from day one

My Century 40" 12s4p made of Samsung 30Ts is runing 100A of battery discharge and it's a fucking rocket runing Unity and it's the best eboard I have riden in my life, again zero issues.

This is has been my experience, would I recommend 12s and FOC, yes but only with Focbox or Unities as I never tried anything else besides them

@AgressivStreetLamp Voltage spikes are what could most likely kill your vesc. I think @Winfly run 13s and has some data logs where he hit like 58v during breaking.

That is the most important point.  Focboxes.  They can handle the voltage no drama.

Yeah I can't say I've had that much luck.  Focboxes are reliable though.  Very much so.  Alan rides like a nutcase too.  I have bought 8 of those things and only killed 3.  Of those 3 two were my fault and the other one just randomly died on me. Middle mosfet and drv.    So 1 out of 8 is not bad for esc's.  Killed far more than that with rc.  They are a bit tetchy.

```
So a failure like this is similar to what happened to me, mine was just about 5% of that. Heat causes a component to catch fire, which is what is seen at first but then a secondary more violent reaction occurs and that is the arc that is being formed when the short circuit results from whatever component dying.

The runaway arc is a superheated gas that consumes everything remotely flammable around it until there is no longer enough material to sustain the arc. (or you pull the loop key) I mean it's not accurate to say this but with plasma is so hot the air itself is burning.

I didn't say that. 

I had a lot of issues but none related to Focbox/Unity failing because of runing 12s in FOC at high current.

I must add to my previous statement, I did try other 4.12 vesc and they have failed at 12s and FOC within hours

It can come from too long and too thin battery wires as inductive voltage spike (this spikes are flattened by the capacitors on the input) or from the motor side, but honestly this I didnâ€™t fully understood how the spikes build up there.

So to converge some thoughts here. 
Sounds like 12s is safe on focbox and unity vesc 4.12 hardware. And risky on most/all other 4.12 hardware. What about flipsky hardware?

13s is doable but risky on high quality vesc 4.12 hardware but not recommendable. Impossible on cheaper hardware.

So what that tells me is there is some difference between.the two hardware designs or component list that makes this possible. Anybody know what it is?

For the record, at this point I've resolved to using the TB 4.12 on a request build with 8s and moving to a flipsky dual on the build.in question.

But a focbox is also a 4.12...

I will be running 13s on the unity (13s10p) and see how the unity will do

Chaka @chaka 4.12 can handle 12s

They claim other names because they are not allowed to call their vesc 4.12 (technically) because it is trademarked, even torqueboards refers to their vesc as torque esc

[/quote]

No they upgrade their vesc to be more reliable and handle higher amperage. (Ex, using direct fets and a heatsink) both 4.12 hardware, and unity and also focbox's use hardware rated up to 60v (drv is the limiter)

So how does this summarize it? 

List of max voltage usable for various VESC hardware:

Most 4.12 hardware including Torque Vesc 4.12: less than 12s to be reliable
Focbox : 12 or 13s (experimental) 
Flipsky 4: 12s
Flipsky 6: 13s (experimental)

What about other vesc hardware I'm missing here?

that thing is garbage for anyone over 100 pounds. The dual 100 is also garbage. The flipsky vesc 6 variant is decent but its self contained with its own switch and enclosure so its not ideal for dual builds, or any builds that i would do, seems solid for off road apps maybe.

When you say "garbage" care to elaborate?

Would it be accurate to state:
 The flipsky 4 is not suited for 12s  applications. 

And the flipsky 6 is solid  from an electronics hardware perspective but has unfavorable configuration of accessories.

Thereâ€™s lots of bogus components in some escs.  So theyâ€™re 4.12 but with capacitors which arenâ€™t capable of their stated capacitance and stuff like that.  Even a model from a single manufacturer could be different in different batches.


If u have gearing why bother risking it doing 13s and u could just change gear.   It shows even more likely to be inefficient at higher voltage ironically unless youâ€™re alwats hanging at the higher speed   The esc wonâ€™t be at full duty cycle as often and ilthe increased pwm is a loss.  If u look at the grin motor simulator u can see

What i mean is we ran them at 12S and within a week they were dead. By dead i mean they weren't functioning anymore and  there was smoke and blown components involved. This happened three times in a row, we were part of the beta test group for flipsky. They sent us units, we blew them up and reported back. We did the same for brother hobby, that company with the motors that throw magnets. We did it for skate machines, we broke every board they sent us. Probably the only thing we haven't broken that was sent to us for feedback was Boa Wheels, which reminds me: i still have to break some TorqueBoards wheels.  

If you're stuck using a dual420 or dual420 100 then run it at 10S or less and keep the total battery amps below 40. And make sure you run motor detection without the belts on, they need to be unloaded because they're quirky. And it probably wouldn't hurt to say a few Hail Skatans while you're doing that.

Awesome thanks for the advice guys.
Glad we could nail this info down in one spot. This has kept me from melting a vesc needlessly. Hopefully it will do the same for future builds.

   Sounds like the 4.12 will be moving to the 8s build and a focbox or flipsky 6 will be on order soon for the 12s build.
