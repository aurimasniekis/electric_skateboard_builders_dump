I have two VESC-Xs from Enertion and one of them is being replaced under warranty with the new FOCBOX. As I understand it, the original VESC-X was manufactured in the US but the new FOCBOX is now manufactured in China.

Is the hardware exactly the same? (Aside from different gauge phase wires).

Will I have any problems running my dual motor setup with a VESC-X and a FOCBOX connected via CAN-BUS?

There is a few difference in the placement of certain part, but nothing that could create a problem in your situation.
