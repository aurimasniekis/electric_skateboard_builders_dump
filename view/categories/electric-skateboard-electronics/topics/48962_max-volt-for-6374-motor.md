Hi,
I want to use [this](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-6374s-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-200kv-3200w/) motor and it's just for a 10s battery but I want to use a 12s battery pack. If I just go up to 60Amps could it also work?
Motor with 3200W
50,2V(full charged 12s pack) Ã— 60A (max Amps) = 3024W
Still under 3200W
Could this work or should I never go over 42V (full charged 10s pack)?

Thanks!

Alex

Maytech vesc, 60V 50A  (dual setup so I use two)

As far as I know maytech vesc's have the ERPM limit  of about 60.000 Erpm. 
Most motors have 7 Poles so you have to divide by 7 and get 8570 rpm.
The Motor has 200KV so 200RPM per V that equals 10.000 RPM at 12s (50V)
So at the top end you are pushing your Vesc to an area where they are prone to failure.

Its why I am selling 170KV 6374 Motors as they will not break most people's ESC's.

Yes anything over 170KV will over long kill your ESC at 12s.

Okay thank you very much, I will look for a lower kv motor because I really want to go with a 12s.

By the idiom you used I am assuming you are German or Austrian.

You speak german too, bimmer is probably out of range^^ 
I can recommend APS, has almost every kv you want or can order them for you, also his motors come with sensors if desired and all i got have silicon wires.

I took my 1200gs through the Dolomites in 2013. Pretty sure that should be close to you.

Btw.

With DHL and a small reduction in price my motors are the same price as APS while being plug an play for vescs. Sensor is already 2mm micro jst and at 200mm better suited.
