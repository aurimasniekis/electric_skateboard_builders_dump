I accidentally cut my phase wires too short when soldering bullet connectors. Before i start to resolder the Phase wires from the motor itself, i ask myself what could happen if 1 phase wire lost connection while riding. No shorting in this case, only lost connection.

Will the lost connection instantly burn my drv up?

Your back foot will get trapped inbetween motor mount and belt, set screws will come loose, batteries will become severely unbalanced and then you'll face brake. Other than that, no worries.
