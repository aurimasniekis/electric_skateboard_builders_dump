Hi All,

I'm a heavy dude and wanted to build a board that would be able to carry me uphill on my daily commute.
I'll share details of my build another time, but wanted to share the calculations I used to select my components.

I feel confident about all the calculations except the Kv-Kt conversion:
I used Kv[(rad/sec)/volt)*Kt[Nm/A]=1
Hopefully that's true...

Here's a Link - [Leav's Board Calcs](http://goo.gl/ng68Hk)

Would appreciate any input you have, and if it's correct - maybe It will be useful for others.
