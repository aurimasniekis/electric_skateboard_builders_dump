There have been many VESC iterations since it first was released.  However, I can not find a topic which says which types of connections the latest VESC has. Does it come with bullet connectors, also which diameter? I believe the power connectors are XT60, but would also like a conformation. Also, does the VESC come with a servo cable or do you have to provide that for yourself? Which USB type is being used (probably micro?). Consider this post as a summary for the VESC connections

I am talking about the VESC fom Enertion. Adding info for other VESC is also welcome.

Thanks in advance

yes, I ordered two VESC's from Ollin and each one came with a servo wire to connect to the remote. Wish I would've known that before buying some online though.
