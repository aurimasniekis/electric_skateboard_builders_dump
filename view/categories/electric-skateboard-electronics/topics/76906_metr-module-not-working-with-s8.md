I tried connecting with the metr module (The original one not the pro variant).
But my s8+ can't find the module. Is there anyway to get this to work?

I tried the following apps:
- Acmanaic vesc monitor
- Metr
- Perimetr
- BLE bluetooth reader

The s7 edge from my little sister hower does work with it.

But yeah I can't work with that.

s9/s9+ wont work either. its android oreo on samsung devices whats messing up the older BT modules. you would have to downgrade to android 7, bind the module and then upgrade to oreo. the new metr pro module works with oreo though.

Jezus, is there any hope for android 9? Since that update is likely to come next month.

I heard that you need special electroica for that. If I could flash it with an Arduino I would ;(
