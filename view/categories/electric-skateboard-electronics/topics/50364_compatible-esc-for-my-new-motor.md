Hello, thank you all for what I am learning in this forum. I recently bought a 6368 190 Kv sensored and I want to know if I can use a esc that I have from a cheap skateboard. Would it be compatible or will I have a problem? In that case, what economic model would you recommend me? This is the esc...

Thanks!!!

Do you know the ESC model? It looks like the one diyeboard is selling. Was it installed for hubs or belt drive? Because these ESC are not open source so that are programmed differently based on drive sistem. Which battery are you going ti use?

It comes from a 200w hub motor skateboard. Do you think it will work with a belt system? I had thought of a 10s2p. Sorry for my English...
