So I just inspected my VESC from  and i found this sottering job...

For me that looks preeetty weird to me that there is way too much sotter that is touching other stuff which is not be supposed to be touching?

It does say on their website that they test every vesc before they ship so i guess it should work but im kinda scared to connect it to any power source until an expert tells me that this is fine...

EDIT: The holes were cut by me so that I can inspect the vesc a bit better

It's fine, nothing looks shorted to me, that isn't supposed to be

1st, it's solder. 2nd, there's nothing wrong. 3rd, if you'd bother to search instead of taking an uneducated dig at a productive member of this little community you would have found at least a few threads were those exact questions were answered...so tired if this shit.

1. Alright my bad about that word choice.
2. Thank goodness
3. I actually did search it up, but one of the only reasons why I decided it to post it was because i felt like not all vescs in the world are *soldered* the exact same, and I thought mine was a unique case. Other posts that  I have found on this forum were these:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/probably-shorted-vesc-how-to-fix/13913

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-short-uart-ppm-question/7819

And if you see those pictures the *solder* doesn't touch tose pins coming out of the black chip thing. In my case it seemed like it did.

Trust me, I manage and moderate a forum and community that has about 4000+ members and I fully understand the frustrations coming from noobs like me, but I did my research, and even after doing my research I felt like if just because others say it is fine for others and decide to connect it to my battery and by a chance actually destroy my VESC, which is my most expensive hardware I got out of everything, I would have regretted the shit out of my past self so I feel like what I have done here is OK. I did not blatantly ask "what vesc should i get for my build" or "What are the the gear ratios for high torque and high speeds?" without doing one single research. I posted my unique problem to the forum to verify it is ok to connect these to my batteries and not destroy a 100 dollar piece of hardware.

If you cant admit that your post was inflammatory then I'm not  sure why you replied.  Good luck.

never admitted my post was inflammatory, only mentioned that I was a noob but a trying researching noob and only admitted my wrong spelling. I'd rather ask than carelessly kill expensive hardware you know

Edited 

@mmaner For some reason, I hope it doesn’t go well so that a lesson can be learned.

How’s that snowflake? Better?

I just googled “VESC” and found these images. The soldering “issue” you see looks to be normal. So plug away! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/f/2ffdeb08de4f4b6641bbfbf6fceac36bc615f626.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/a/baf36fff5b6d05af2c8b2b3351136b24718cf8a9.jpeg" width="690" height="460"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/e/4e3f5dd9bc1d45545d48bca6c64850bcfd11bd9b.jpeg" width="406" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/0/60c1c56474e52c60d5e78a786e591c0b70b03f36.jpeg" width="690" height="460">

You know what I'll react like an adult to this. I'm sorry.

I might have sounded rude above there and I would like to apologize. I was simply worried if it was going to burn down and it seemed more severe than other posts. I will try to do a bit extra research before I do anything from now.

I was in that night mood when I do such things that I'd never do when sober. I want to be nice and helpful instead of annoying and disruptive.

If anything I want to take down this post but before that I just want to apologize. Sorry about all this mess.

And just so you also know, that part when I mentioned that I had experience with big forums at all, it is still all true (I am one of the news crew and translator for a youtuber called ohnickel. I manage all his korean resources and keep things down and healthy in the communities such as discord and the website underwatch.com. All I wanted to say through this was that I understood the frustration from you all because this post simply sounded like a standard post that seems to not have done any research before posting, but I thought it was different in my case. Again, my mistake.

I noticed that my comment was flagged. I assume you were offended by my snarky remark, for that I apologize...but only because you were offended by a joke. If you were experienced in a forum then you have to realize how annoying it is that we get the same question asked again and again and again. Use google. Use search. No need to post various thread to prove that you did your search. It just tell me you didn’t search hard enough or read enough. We are all keyboard warriors in one way or another.

Yeah, at first I did that simply because I was pissed but I tried to keep it together and calm down for a little bit and decided to apologize. I understand that searching this forum isn't enough. I just instantly thought of asking all of you about this instead of googling "how to tell if vesc/pcb is shorted" since you all were experts in this. Again a mistake I made without thinking for too long.
