 first of all im newbie in this field. Just want to ask if my winboard esc dual setup is already busted. Use it once then suddenly the power is gone. I checked the battery its good. 10s2p but every time i connect the esc the connection blown out, as if.,it is shorted somehow. I checked the esc i cannot see any burned mark in the esc. Thus it mean my esc toast already?

Correct me in this if im wrong. Im not technician. When i try the esc of hoverboard its not making a sound and its working properly when the battery is connected.
