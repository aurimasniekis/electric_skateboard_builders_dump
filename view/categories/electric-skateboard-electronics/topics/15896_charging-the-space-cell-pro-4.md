I know this may seem to be a peculiar question, so apologies, but is it safe to charge Enertion's SPACE Cell Pro with any charger that fits into the port? 

I'm in my office at the moment, having run low on battery on the way to work. I'm looking at the charge port and it looks like your average laptop charger. If one fits into the port, will it charge it the same as the charger Enertion sent?

No!
The charger's output voltage needs to fit to your battery.

Hell no!!!!

Plugs can be interchangable, but the voltage and amerage outputs can vary greatly. The transformer (black box) usually will have every different values.
