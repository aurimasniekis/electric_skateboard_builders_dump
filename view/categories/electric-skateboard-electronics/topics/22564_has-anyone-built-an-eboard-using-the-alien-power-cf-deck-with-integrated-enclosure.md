I just got this deck and although is sweet looking, I don't know how I'm gonna get my motor wires into the enclosure. Has anyone else built and eboard with this deck? I'm guessing I'll need to drill holes somewhere. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/5/05027129cb0d1fbb8cbbe4fdc2822fbff013cd18.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I also don't know which is front vs. rear!

Thoughts on this guys?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/e/0e43b45245b85e4e9e4582289b786d26cec6d568.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/4/c4fec246bd553bc7c03b0c9ff66e929a0eecea1c.jpg" width="666" height="500">

This looks like it uses the same deck

That may give you some help on how to run the cables

Sweet deck... hate that they branded it so obviously though. Anyways, a drill and some careful dremeling and you'll have 3 ports for motor wires in no time.

@hornet90 I haven't seen any pics of completes.

@gordy I looked at that complete and its definitely a different deck.

@anorak234 the branding marks are just decals as far as I can tell. I might just leave it though. Yeah I'll be drilling it but wish they would have incorporated the holes into the original design.

Thanks guys

Find some proper grommets before you commence the drilling, it will add a nice finish.

Possibly. I will be in Los Angeles in about a week. What exactly was involved in repairing the mounting holes? Did they drill them in the wrong place, so now there are extra holes? Or did they not use the correct drill bit, so they needed to be widened? Do you have an exact weight on the board? Is it still unused, and in new condition? Lastly, how much do you want for it?

Yeah they drilled the holes in the wrong pattern. I just expoxied the holes and redrilled then correctly.

It unused, I think it was like $400. Make an offer of youd like.
