The blue 90mm listing is mine. If ya want to buy them directly from me on here instead of on ebay, it will save you a bit of money. üëçüèª

Glad you like them. Sold quite a few sets and not one unhappy buyer yet. Not sold many through the forum though, so my post in the market section kinda died. Enjoy :)

Looks pretty good! Are these mixed or hot-poured?
