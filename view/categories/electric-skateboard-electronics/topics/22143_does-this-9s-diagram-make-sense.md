There are a few things that stick out to me.

- Make sure your balance is hooked up correctly or you'll get sparks. I have mine below.

- Not sure on this, but you don't show how your changer is connected to the positive and neg ends of the battery, is there a way to charge off the balance plug?
- If there isn't I think you'll need to charge liiike this:

- Of course the loop key would need to be disconnected while you are charging...

I think ill try to bms it in the end, I just have to figure it out :) here the plan was to use a series adapter for the 6s, but you are right for the 3s part, Id need a parallel charging port..
