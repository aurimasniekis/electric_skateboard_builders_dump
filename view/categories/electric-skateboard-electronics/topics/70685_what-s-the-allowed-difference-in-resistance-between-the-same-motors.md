So I recently bought a couple motors with exact kv and everything. I would expect the resistance to be somewhat similar but during motor setup in vesc tool I noticed one motor has a resistance of 6–8 while the other one is around 14-16. Is this a notmal thing? I’ve tried switching the vesc’s around and tried moving the max voltage around in vesc tool but nothing is helping. I can definitely feel the restance when I’m just trying to spin the wheel by hand. Now the setup was done without anything attached to motors so there’s no other interference that could cause any sort of drag or anything.
