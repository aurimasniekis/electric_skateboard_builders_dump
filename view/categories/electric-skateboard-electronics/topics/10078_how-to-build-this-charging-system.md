Hey guys, i was watching great scotts diy electric long board, and wondered how he managed to charge/use the batteries.

If you see, he has a switch with 3 positions, on off and charge. in the instruct able i can see the schematic, just wondering how hard/expensive a solution like this would be, and how fee-sable it is. Thanks

Not hard and pretty cheap. Just a switch and some spare battery connectors for the charging part of the wiring.

I would buy some switches rated for the current.. the ones great scott used are way underrated for the current.., I dont know their resistance in the contacts, but I would guess they get really hot :-/
