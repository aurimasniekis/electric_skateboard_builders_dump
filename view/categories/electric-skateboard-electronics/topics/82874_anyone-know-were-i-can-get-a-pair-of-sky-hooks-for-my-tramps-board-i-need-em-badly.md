They were very funny jokes that should be appreciated more, and the pics you added didn't load so we don't know what you're looking for

But yes what you're looking for are sky hooks

Sky hooks are something you send the apprentice to get at the hardware store like a left handed screw driver or long weight.  Maybe there are some called sky hooks but not sure even so it was funny and make sure the pics upload in future so we can help.
