Does anyone know a relatively easy way I would go about adding USB ports to charge other items through my space cell pro? Any and all advice would be appreciated! :slight_smile:

You could wire a buck converter to the discharge leads and then run a 12v-5v usb charger off that

Do you have any links to a buck converter that would work for me?

So I just bought something similar to that from another site. Is it as easy as just buying a parallel xt60 splitter and plugging  the step down in one port and the vesc in the other?

I guess you could do that, but it's just extra cables. I usually make a small cut somewhere along the wires and solder to that.
