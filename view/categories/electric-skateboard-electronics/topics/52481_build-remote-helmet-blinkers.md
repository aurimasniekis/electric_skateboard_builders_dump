Hi guys,

I would like to build Remote Helmet Blinkers and I'm wondering where should I start ?

The goal would be to have : 
- 1 front white light
- 1 rear red light
- 2x  side orange blinkers

I guess my best option would be to connect some led strip to an arduino and a RF receiver.
Then control that with a switch connect to another arduino and a RF transmitter.

Any idea or reference to help me ?

Thank you. :slight_smile:

I think the first problem to solve would be detecting the turn.  What did you have in mind?  You'd need a way to electrically detect the truck lean...

Well I was thinking of two switches add on the remote.
Left and right switches with a wireless connection to the lights

The mini remote has a steering wheel already, you mean something like that?

Some bike lights in aliexpress have this functionality already.

@b264 Well, I don't have a steering wheel on mine so I was thinking of a complete add-on.
Maybe a second mini-remote for my left hand.

@laurnts Any links. I might be able to savage one to fit my needs

Or maybe, just two switches directly on my helmet.
I could add those near my chin...
