Hey guys so I was riding my board just fine the other night and then I came to it the next day and my motors were not spinning up. I tried to see if it was my remote but it was not, nothing is blocking my motor from spinning and my VESC turns on. The problem I am having now that I've connected my board to my computer is my VESC is not showing up as plugged in or connected. The VESC has the lights on and everything shows it's getting power but I've got nothing. Please help
