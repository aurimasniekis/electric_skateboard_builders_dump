Hi

i'm looking to build a Loaded Vanguard e-board, here's my ideas so far:

[VESC](https://www.scramboards.com/vesc-vedder.html)
[Alien Drive Systems Electric longboard DIY kit](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/cnc-kit/alien-drive-complete-kits/alien-drive-systems-electric-longboard-diy-kit-63mm-motor/)
[Alien 6374 Sensored Outrunner brushless motor 170KV 3200W](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-6374-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-170kv-3200w/)
[XT90-S Anti-Spark](https://www.hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-s-anti-spark-connector-2pairs-bag.html)
[2.4Ghz mini remote controller with receiver](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2-4Ghz-mini-remote-controller-with-receiver-for-electric-skateboard-longboard/32573238408.html?spm=2114.10010108.1000013.3.7Z0izV&scm=1007.13339.33317.0&pvid=f069ba64-320b-4ad4-9e4b-e2c844f328fb&tpp=1)

Ok a few questions:

1. What kind of Trucks should I get? Caiber / Cailber II / Paris V1 / V2 / Surf Rods indeez / Liquid Attack Black Star / Alien Trucks
2. Whats the difference between all these trucks and does it really matter? :) will any fit on the Vanguard Board?
3. Which is better ABEC 11 or Orangatang Kegel?
4. Can anyone recommend a 10s battery that would be suitable for the Vanguard? or maybe 2 x 5s? or 2 x 6s?
5. What kind of flex should I get? i'm 75kg

I'm hoping to ride around 25 mph, I live in a pretty flat area so hills aren't a problem.

Hi

Are you in Europe? Have you bought the board yet? 

Look at my build thread, maybe you'll find some answers to your questions

If you decide to proceed with this build, I could sell you my board as I'm looking into buying a different one now, with less flex. I've only rode this board for 30 min to see how it performs, it's practically new

It's not that I don't like it, it's great. I weigh 80kg

I just want a smaller 36'' deck and less flex. I would keep the Vanguard too, lol, but I'm not that rich :(

Maybe I'll rebuy it next year, and make a vanguard e-sk8 too :smiley:

I'm abit confused about deck flex, the guide on here says go for a stiff board (which is easier to control at high speeds?) but alot of people say a flexible board takes out all the bumps in the road and makes a really smooth ride, plus the boosted board is pretty flexible.

You are selling the whole E-sk8 or just the Loaded vanguard deck? What price are you looking for?

I don't know about stiff boards that much, what I know is that the Vanguard is great at high speeds. More people on this forum can confirm this as well. 
I'm only selling the board, I'm keeping the rest of the parts because I would be buying a new board.

I bought a few months ago from sickboards for €182

https://www.sickboards.nl/en/all-deck-only-s/386-loaded-vanguard-bamboo-deck-only.html?search_query=loaded%20va&fast_search=fs

It's brand new, there's no extra holes or anything, I only rode it once for 30 min outside to see how it is. Pretty awesome :smiley:

I'm asking €160 

Board would ship from Spain

Whats the difference between all these trucks and does it really matter? :slight_smile: will any fit on the Vanguard Board?[/quote]

Depends mostly on what kind of motor mount you get.  *MOST* folks here (DIY) go with Caliber II's as the shape of the truck hanger gives you a solid mount w/o rotation.  I ran v1 ADS mounts on Paris 195's and did not like how frequently they rotated (and scraped on the ground).  So personally i'd avoid round trucks.  There are ways to fix or help prevent, but even easier is Caliber II trucks!

Both will fit Vanguard.  No matter what trucks you get - spend the extra $ and get good bushings setup correctly for your weight!  Makes a HUGE difference.  Truly.


[quote="nonstop, post:1, topic:12653"]
Which is better ABEC 11 or Orangatang Kegel?[/quote]
Vanguard has a lot of room for bigger wheels - so either.  It's preference and like asking if you like blondes or redheads better...  I think there are more options using flywheel wheels and gears, so usually stick with them.  Kegels are REALLY nice though and i'm setting up a pair to try out more.  But you're stuck with kegels if you go that route.  later, rough roads, or want bigger wheels... no bigger kegel options, or softer, or smaller, or less $$$ clones (that i've seen).  So with all that i'd suggest Abec Flywheels to start.  Tried and true, and flexible down the road when you know more of what you like and want.

Li Ion or Lipo?  Budget for battery/batteries?

[quote]Flex 1 (42"/107cm): 175-230+lbs / 80-105+kg 
Flex 2 (42"/107cm): 150-210+lbs / 68-95+kg
Flex 3 (38"/98cm): 150-200+lbs / 68-90+kg
Flex 4 (38"/98cm): 120-170+lbs / 55-77+kg
Flex 5 (38"/98cm): 80-140+lbs / 35-65+kg[/quote]
I am a big guy and have 42" Flex 1.  I like the flex, but still might stiffen it a bit.

Flex = PITA when you are building esk8.  The best solutions i've seen are OKP and whitepony's builds, and squad's...  When done correctly i think it looks better than Boosted!

[/quote]
25 is totally doable w/ almost any setup - look at some gear calculators.  15/36 is the most common (enertion's kit gearing motor/wheel)

There is definitely a trade-off with flex.  It does help with bumps, but it is not as capable toe-to-toe with a stiff downhill board at speed (everything else being the same - mostly dependent on skill).  I'm not a downhill guy, so that's just my opinion.  I've yet to see a downhill race w/ vanguard being used.

There are a couple 3d printable enclosures for vanguard too i'd look at.  You will want to separate your batteries and electronics with the middle bare to allow flex.  I'm sure you know this, but just a reminder.

I know it's a lot of info - HTH and GL!

Lipo, not sure on budget... cheap as possible ;) 

i'd like a good range tho maybe 7 - 10 miles or more

I am using a Vanguard Flex 1 for my E-board build. I weigh about 70 kg and the board sags approximately 3.5 cm from its nominal height (me standing on the middle of the board). Bit jumping on the board brings it down to about 5-6cm from nominal height. A flex 3 for instance does flex way more and could also bottom out (depending on your weight). I did not like it ....

Yes, it's great but still a pain to mount the stuff since the board still flexes quite a bit. You need to think a bit how to mount the components. Also, as shown above, a flex 1 is several inches longer and therefore heavier than a flex 3 deck but I don't mind the extra weight. If you can get your hands on a Boosted give it a try (just to get a feel for a flexy board)

Hey nonstop did you start your build? 

I'm looking to do the same build but with a lot more range, maybe using a 10S4P battery, however I'm not sure if it would be possible to mount it on the Vanguard. 

There was a Vanguard build around here with very slim profile CF enclosure that looked amazing.

Are you using the Space cell pro 4 or the pro 3? Those enclosures allow some level of flexibility? 

Does it work on the Vanguard flex 1? Does the enclosure bend at all? 

Would you mind share your build log?

I am using the Raptor Space cell on a flexible mount (still waiting for the parts). The board doesn't flex that much and it should work in principle. Let's see how this goes ... 

I don't think the Spacecell 3 or 4 would work for that amount of flex. I will put all together when the parts arrive for the battery mount.

No they don't. Just do enclosure in 2 parts like Boosted and everyone else.

This.

It's really simple - pick any stiff deck w/ no flex and spacecell and similar work great.  If you want flex - you need two enclosures, or just one so the middle can flex.

trying to cobble together a stiff battery under a flexy deck = failure eventually.  Either the mounts will flex and slowly wear out the bolt holes, or you will flex a battery pack not intended to flex (solder will break - bad things inside pack will happen), or both will happen.  NOT A GOOD IDEA.

You can make your own battery in a different configuration to better fit, but use the right battery for the board would be my strong suggestion.

I'm having a hard time looking for builds with 10S4P split in two enclosures, just one guy did it in France but had to do a custom carbon fiber enclosure.

Anyone would like to share their build log?

Maybe you should do singledrive with 6374 size motor and 10s3p if you are sure you wanna do another boosted copy?

I love the Vanguard design on the Boosted. I don't like the Boosted range and low speed capability. 

I'd like a dual motor setup, but it's not the easiest build.

I have a 2 enclosed setup with a big battery. And it wouldn't be much bigger for a 10S4P.
I will be uploading my enclosure templates today.

Denton, I saw your build already, it was really nice but it's a process I won't be able to do, there is no artistic side on me to design and build an enclosure.

What I'm looking is to 3D print the enclosure, It'd hold a lot better than CF or fiberglass.

I still feel like mine turned out okay in the end, but I would like to try out this 3D printed model.
