Please, please, please **Please** read up on the forums before you try to undertake such a task
Batteries can be super dangerous when done incorrectly, and the forum contains a wealth of information that you can easily access all through the use of the search function. There no way that you're gonna get years of information given to you here. 
If youre not up to the challenge of reading, youre not up to the challenge of building a battery
if thats the case- just get it built!

Have a search around for similar builds.
Such as..
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-single-motor-10s5p-bms-vesc/25710/8
Search function is very useful.

I would suggest that you contact @psychotiller about him building a battery for you because that is by far the easiest part to mess up and can have horrible outcomes.

Not to mention the tools and supplies to build a battery pack aside from the actual parts you need that are part of the pack. If you plan on just building a pack and that's it. You'll be hard press to break even. If you plan on maybe making more or continual upkeep, then sure. Go for it. When you factor in the time to research SUFFICIENTLY and gathering what you need, there's nothing wrong with just saying I rather get it premade. This is the one aspect of building DIY you don't want to take lightly.

Its cheaper and safer just to pay someone to make you a pack because he know what hes doing and has experience
