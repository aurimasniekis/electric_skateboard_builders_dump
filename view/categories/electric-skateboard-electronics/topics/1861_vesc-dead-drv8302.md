I bought two vescs from enertion back on the end of January but only had the change to play with them this week.

I tested one on my electric skate using only one 5s lipo cell. And it was ok, them I connected two 5s lipo in series, to get a 10s battery. Well, the new tests did not end so well...

As you can see in the picture, clearlly the DRV8302 died. 

Do you guys have any idea why that might happened? I don't want to blow another VESC.

I was using FOC and a 245 kv turnigy motor, with a total 10S.
