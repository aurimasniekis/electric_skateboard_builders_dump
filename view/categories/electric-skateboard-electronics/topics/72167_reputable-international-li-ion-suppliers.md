Hi Guys,

I live in Cape Town, South Africa, and I'm finding it difficult to source Samsung 30Q 18650 cells, or any other cell for that matter, as the majority I've found are either fake or cost an arm and a leg. 

Do you guys know of any reputable sites / suppliers that ship internationally, and specifically to SA?

I've tried eBay and AliExpress, but from what I've seen, most offerings look too good to be true and are probably fake.

http://ru.nkon.nl
 

From what I gathered from various sites, nkon seems to be very reliable

Thanks for the reply! Doesn't look like they ship to SA though, I get "Sorry, no quotes are available for this order at this time." when checking out. :/

Send a mail to c.s and ask whatsup. I do think they can ship the cells to SA

Yup, even though it's available in the drop down, when you proceed to checkout and enter an address, it displays the error message. 

I mailed them and asked if they deliver to SA: _"Hi, no sorry. Only sea freight but that will be expensive (like 600 euro) for small qty."_

I'm also from SA. Unfortunately it's really difficult getting cells here because of shipping restrictions. In the end I brought 30x 30Q cells back from the States when I visited over summer.

You could try asking this seller if they have a shipping option to SA: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4PCS-LiitoKala-100-original-New-for-Samsung-INR-18650-battery-3-7V-3000mAh-INR18650-30Q-li/32809823573.html They have been around for 5 years and have a good reputation.

Alternatively, BatteryBro quoted me $360 for 50x 30Q cells shipped via "Special Line Shipping", which apparently includes all customs/duty fees. So about $7.20 per cell.

Thanks for the link, I'll give that a go!

I've mailed BatteryBro as well, and they look like a viable option, although they do state that they only do B2B, which might be a problem.

I've also just found these, https://www.illumn.com/18650-samsung-3000mah-inr18650-30q-high-discharge-flat-top.html, and it looks like they offer shipping to SA, at $93.50 using FedEx International Economy. I've not used them before, but I'm assuming I would still be liable for duties and taxes above and beyond the shipping fee.

I hadn't, but I'm looking into it now. 

Do you perhaps have any recommendations on good brands / battery packs?

I would look at turnigy, that’s if Hobbyking will ship to SA. They have a wide range of cells. The best are graphene, then turnigy or zippy. I would advise against multistar and I’ve heard some bad things about nano tech too

You are saying that Illumin is selling fake cells? 
The link you posted is taking about a different seller.

Thanks, I've had a look on HobbyKing, and [these](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-graphene-5000mah-5s1p-65c.html) graphene packs look to be the best. Although, a friend recommended Gens Ace. :thinking:

I'm thinking two of these in parallel should do the trick? To which I plan to add a 10s 36V BMS.

I'm not that familiar with lipos, but I've heard that they suffer less voltage sag, assuming they're decent cells.

Graphene packs are good, if you want maximum battery protection order a bms from bestech and have custom parameters like discharge cut off set to 3v or more

You should put them in series. 36v and 5000mAh instead of 18v and 10000mAh

Thanks for the link. I had a chat to Mike not too long ago via your website, about shipping a FOCBOX to SA, and he said that it can't be done, due to issues with customs.

@onloop  is the head of enertion, if he says it can be done I’m sure it can. Also that’s an insane deal.

@onloop
It's not possible to ship to SA due to custom issues and less express lines

Older thread, but reviving it as I am looking at getting 18650's into SA. How did you carry the 30 x 30Q cells? I'm guessing hand luggage, but did the airlines not enquire about them and their capacity?

## \#32 Posted by: Bataleon Posted at: 2019-09-26T18:40:34.726Z Reads: 26

```
@jezza Yes, all 30 individual cells were in my hand luggage, in their original box. As long as each cell is below 100Wh you're allowed as many as you like. Samsung 30Q cells are 10.8Wh each.

I also printed out the specifications sheet listing all the technical data, in case there were any questions/issues. Never needed it though.

From what I understand you can only take 2 spare batteries under 100Wh. Have you got a link to any regulations that says you can take as many cells as you want if under 100Wh?
If I can take many cells that would be awesome!
