Hey guys,

I want to buy a spot welder to make li-ion packs myself but I don't know which one to get.  I have heard mixed reviews about the Sunkko 788h.

I was considering buying this DIY spot welder from the following website: https://malectrics.eu/product/diy-arduino-battery-spot-welder-kit-v3-2-2-full-bundle-lipo-battery/

Does anyone here know about this welder or should I stick with the Sunkko?  Any advice from someone with a little experience would be greatly appreciated!

A lot of people on the forums use [this](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/boss-level-custom-spot-welder/25980) spotwelder.

Comes from South Korea, so might have to pay VAT when it gets delivered if your in EU.

I have this one, a version slightly older.  It is great.  I hook it up to a car battery...

Just got the Boss,  the Sunkko 709a started giving me problems after the first small battery. (7s3p)

It still spot welds but for some reason the soldiering iron is no longer working. 

I tried the Boss soldering iron with a 19v power supply and it got hot quick I like it. I'm waiting for my Lipo to come on to start using the spot welder.

The Boss welder sounds great!

I really like the DIY one I linked too after watching a few videos, but I'd rather buy the Boss welder everyone else has so they can help me learn how to use it or fix it if it breaks.

Hopefully someone on the forum who bought the DIY welder I linked and will see this thread to give a recommendation.

Check also kweld. I think it's the most robust but maybe overkill for 1-2 packs

Hmm I was looking at mine and I'd have to remove the heat shrink to see how the tips come off I dont have any that size so I won't be taking it apart till I get more heat shrink but for now I'd use sand paper and sand down your tips to make them look like new.

I'm gona do that soon I'll post pics of before and after cause my tips look to be in not the best shape( I got my welder used) but I'm positive I can clean them up.

Just recently got a maelectrics spot welder to build my pack. I love it! I use a 11.1V 5000mah turnegy pack to power it and it works great.

I got one from AliExpress

SUNKKO 737G 1.5kw spot lasser machine led light lasmachine voor 18650 batterij spot lassers
 http://s.aliexpress.com/7vQrMnYz?fromSns=Copy to clipboard

It sometimes blows my main fuse. But I guess all high-power welders will do that on 230v 16A

Good luck! The title is not indicative, but I thought this thread had good info on malectrics.

My Sunkko blew something on it's startup from the buttons.. haven't looked into the guts, but no worky-worky atm

It's sodding iron comes easily off from it's holder

Sunkko works okay but I did have issues with it when I had it on for a long period of time it just stopped working all together I tried a few hours later and it was good to go again. I use the Boss spot welder now it works as long as your lipo has power lol

I have brought this one - https://www.keenlab.de/index.php/product/kweld-complete-kit/
Have not yet used it properly, so i cant say if its good for long time use

You can see more about it here on youtube - https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kweld

I've been practicing at Psychotiller's shop with a Sunkko 709 seems to work good and he's probably built a lot of packs with it.

I wonder if the malfunction is using it continuously for too long. With my Malectrics spot welder I donâ€™t use gloves while spot welding and as soon as the prongs on the end get hot to the touch (after about 15-20 welds at 30ms pulse) I stop using it and let it cool off while working on another part of the board. I have soldered over 150 cells with it now and no issues.

I have a sunkko 709a I would be willing to sell if interested. I bought it used on here but never built a pack out of it. I did make maybe fifty practice welds so it seems to work fine.

I have a hakko Fx-100 soldering station and ended up doing fused cells. That station made quick work of the pack.

I think Iâ€™ll probably do cell fusing for a battery pack if planning on making for an ebike. Any advise you can give on how you did it? Could you post any pictures? I am gonna do a 6p20s pack with a max current draw of 90A and Iâ€™m not exactly sure what gauge and length of fuse wire I should use.

22 awg single strand copper is good. It fuses around 40 amps which a short circuited cell will definetly see. I went with 20 awg for reduced resistance as it will fuse at 58 amps. I think a shorted quality cell can deliver as much as 300 amps so I feel protected. 24 awg melts at only 29 amps which feels far too close to what we can see. I donâ€™t want one to ever fail under normal high demand situations. 

Aluminum would be better since it has a lower melting temp but itâ€™s even harder to find ![image|450x303](upload://joJtKYbjwmeNSmUtWtDA1f0ivAo.jpeg)

Nice, I like this. This is how Tesla all builds their packs. Do you know how the pack behaves with one shorted cell?

Unfortunately no. I wish I had a solution to view all voltages or get an alert.

Thanks for the info & pictures! I will definitely be trying this myself. Also, I wonder if making an enclosure out of clear polycarbonate would work to see each fuse without removing the enclosure. Maybe @psychotiller would be able to make an enclosure out of some clear polymer?

They make displays that show the voltage of each p group. That would be best probably. But Iâ€™m not sure how reliable they are or if they drain the battery.

Yeah that would work, but it would be pretty sweet to have an enclosure where you could see the internals.  Would look super awesome with good wire management. I put so much work into making the internals look pretty so it would be nice to show it off!
