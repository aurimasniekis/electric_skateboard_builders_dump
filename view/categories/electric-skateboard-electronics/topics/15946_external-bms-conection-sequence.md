Hello guys, I have the BMS for my next build here and thought of using it to charge the board in am currently riding
Does que order I make the connections matter? I would plug a power plug for the main charge and on a separated conector the balance cable

Since I am balance charging each half (2x5s), I want to simplify charging and be able to charge on the go

Since it took a long time for my BMS to arrive I don't wanna blow it on the first try

Thanks
