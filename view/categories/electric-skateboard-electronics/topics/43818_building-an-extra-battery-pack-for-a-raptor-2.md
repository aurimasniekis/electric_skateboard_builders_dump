So, after more than a year waiting, at last I got my Raptor 2.

I removed the battery before shipping it to Lima Peru, so I could have one battery ready for my trips in USA and wouldn't have the need to make an expensive international battery shipment every time I travel with my batteryless board.

I'm going to build a new battery pack:

However in order to wire the BMS into the battery correctly I need the Enertion BMS pin out order.

Is there a way to detect whats pin goes to what positive side pack? An incorrectly wired BMS could burn the BMS.

There are eleven pins on the BMS, can someone send me a picture of their Space Cell battery just to see which one is pin #1?

@blasto could probably help you with the pinout of the bms

The bms is not part of the battery pack in this setup correct? Thats an interesting design decision. I think it's nice and efficient as you only need one bms for as many battery packs as you desire.

Oohhhh!!! congratulations for your new toy!!! i love the R2!
@Blasto what do you think about to run this hubs with 12S?

Someone will do it soon enough, it should be pretty insane at 12s I'm still waiting for mine to show up to try it out.

use a multimeter on the bms plug on the battery pack...

ahh hang on, do you have access to the battery pack?

I'm building a new battery pack tonight, as soon as I finish it and plug it on the board, I'll measure the voltages from the BMS pins

I‚Äôll probe my battery when i get home in a few hours.

Yes 12S should be pretty insane

Isn't it a 10s bms, if so how will he wire it for 12s?
```

He need to change the bms, but with a 12s3p configuration, he should be able to fit a second bms for the 12s

Yeah it‚Äôs a 10S bms. Can‚Äôt use it and would need to put a zeors resistor on the switch to not use a bms at all (r6 i believe, says by-pass on the silkscreen)
```

So why does he need the pin out then?
```

Because he want to make a replacement battery for the Raptor, not a completely different battery

I understand that but if wants to make a new battery that is 12s he won't be able to use the existing bms? So why does he need the pin out, I think I'm kinda lost here

He never mentioned wanting to do a 12s Battery this only as been a suggestion from other people üòâ

Oh I understand now. I read a post up a bit and thought he was meaning this board was going to run 12s. Thanks mate

Is it not labelled B+ & B- at each end of the 11 pins?

So I understand the black wire goes to the negative of battery pack, the remaining to each positive of each pack in order respectively?

@blasto thanks man!

I finished the battery today, but before connecting the balancing wires I went ahead and connected the battery, however the board doesn't not turn on.

I wonder if there is some kind of safety device that prebent the board from turning on if the balancing wires are not connected.

I checked the fuse and it was ok.

Any input will be appreciated.

thanks!

yes the BMS controls the main switch, the balance wires must be plugged. You also might need to plug the charger once to kick out the BMS of it‚Äôs low voltage state

I'm going to use a 11 pin JST connector but I'm still unsure on the correct wiring.

Would you please help me out letting me know in this picture what is the positive of first pack? does the first wire goes to negative of the battery?

Do you have by chance the wiring diagram of the Raptor 2??? 

I have the Space Cell 4 (whithout bms + switch + plug) but going through some trouble to connect it to my dual FOCBOX diy build! Thanks.

Well today it's the first test.

I'm travelling to Orlando with my Raptor with no battery

[img]https://i.imgur.com/1oxV7d3.jpg[/img]

I wonder if they could refuse the boarding by not believing that the eboard has no battery, I'm taking an allen wrench to take off the enclosure in case they want to verify it.

Can you make a R2 enclosure for the evo with battery meter/power button window? Thx!

You can just switch the Regular enclosure of the Raptor2 to a new deck.

I don't get it, you want the R2 design? or a copy of the enclosure?

The same enclosure you made for the Evo, but with the window cut out, I guess. Trying to keep it as ‚Äúfactory feeling‚Äù as possible. 

Otherwise, I‚Äôm swapping over to the blood slayer

Because they are still working on there design, but Zenit https://www.zenitboards.com/fr/ are working on something similar to the bloodslayer, but lighter... [spoiler]and who knows maybe a version with an enclosure integrated[/spoiler]

Wow integrated enclosure would be dope. I checked out zenit after trying your deck when you were in nyc. I really liked it. 

I already got the blood slayer though, but no reason I can‚Äôt use it for a different build.

It did work at the moment, I was able to cross customs and airport security with no issues at all, however when I went to pick up the spare battery to my friend house I found out he had flown out of the city for work.

So I had to take my board back without even riding it.
