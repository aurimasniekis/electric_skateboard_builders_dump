Wondering if anyone uses this charger? https://m.aliexpress.com/item/32820717696.html?trace=wwwdetail2mobilesitedetail&productId=32820717696&productSubject=50-4V4A-Charger-12S-44-4V-E-Bike-Li-ion-Battery-Smart-Charger-Lipo-LiMn2O4-LiCoO2&spm=a2g0s.12269583.0.0.23f737b6T8Zlqn

I ordered it but will be here in awhile, but want to finish the last 3 connections on my battery/bms. What is the polarity of the 2.1mm plug on this? Meaning is center positive or side. Thank you!

That's pretty much the standard 12s charger that most people use with a 3 or 4p battery. 

Mine works ok still but the LED status light died on me after a few weeks, I know it's done charging when I hear the fan stop running.

Do you remember the plug polarity or is it on the box? Just looking to finish my battery. Thanks!

I don't remember but what I did was plug the charger in the charger port with the charger port not connected to anything and checked the terminals on the back of the port with a multimeter to be 100% sure.

Yeah, I know that is the preferred way, but was hoping to finish the battery before the charger got here. I'll probably have to wate(pun).
