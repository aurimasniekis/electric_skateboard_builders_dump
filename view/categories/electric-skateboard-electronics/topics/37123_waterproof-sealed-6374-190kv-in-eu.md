eskating.eu has exactly [this](https://eskating.eu/product/eskating-pro-motors-6374-190kv-waterproof-sealed-and-sensored/).  190KV 6374 sealed and waterproof.  Am looking at the 6355 version for a build I'm planning.

are you looking for water-**resistant** or water-**proof**
water resistant means you can ride through puddles
water proof means you can ride on the bottom of a lake

brushless motors are naturally water resistant.  just make sure to wipe off the outer case (thing that spins) once your done riding through water

edit: spaced out, itâ€™s called the can

What is the difference between:

https://street-wing.com/product/6355-190-motorbike

and

https://eskating.eu/product/eskating-pro-motors-6355-190kv-waterproof-sealed-and-sensored/

The eskating.eu one seems to be rated at a much higher wattage for example...why? @DavidBanner

It's a different motor.

If you check the specs on eskating.eu: 
"PLEASE NOTE: This 6354 Motors are longer than normal so just use 9mm width belts and pulleys to let them fit perfectly (dual drive systems)"

Maybe they are using longer stators, hence the need for a larger can? Possibly it's actually a 6365 sized motor?
