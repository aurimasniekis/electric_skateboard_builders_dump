Hi guys,

sorry for amateur question, but I just got my parts delivered, and I cant work my head around it. Tried to google it, search it here as well but could not find answer. Got my Turningy sk3 aerodrive 213kv motor delivered and it has got all 3 cables black. No marking on them what so ever and I am wondering how to connect it to speed controler without doing any harm. Common sense is telling me that there should be difference, but why they would make all 3 cables same colour if there would be. 

Thanks for your help!

No difference. These are the motor phase wires. Plug them with you VESC or ESC and do motor detection. If they run in the other direction then disconnect two of them and invert the position. You should get the direct spinning direction.
