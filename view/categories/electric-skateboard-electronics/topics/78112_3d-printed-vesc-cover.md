I recently designed and 3D printed this VESC cover. I have added small heat sinks to the VESC, soldered a PWM connector to the VESC, and switched the orientation of the battery wires. Everything is held in place with 10 small screws. The box measures to be 120mm L x 52mm W x 24mm H.

I will as soon as I finish the design. I still have to add holes for all of the ports on the VESC because right now I only have a hole for the UART port and the USB.
