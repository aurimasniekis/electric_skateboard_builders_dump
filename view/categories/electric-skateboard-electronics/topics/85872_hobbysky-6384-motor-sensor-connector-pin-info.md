HobbySky 6384 Motor is really attractive price($89).
But seller do not provided sensor connector information.
So, I have disassembled this motor for get sensor connector pin information.

Black => GND
Orange=> +5V

Red, White, Yellow => A/B/C

This motor do not have temp sensor.

AFAIK as long as red and black are in appropriate places, sensor wire dont matter the order. I may be wrong though. So dont quote me

Generally, Red is +5V
But Orange is +5V in this motor.
