I've got dual Focboxes, dual 6374 SK3 Turnigy sensored motors.  When I accelerate from standing, one of the motors stutters slightly until i'm at speed.  When I apply the breaks, possibly the same motor stutters / makes a loud noise.  Any ideas what it could be?

The loud noise indicates a skipping belt to me. How loose are they? Is one looser than the other?

Ahh, yes, one appears to be loose.  I put the entire board back together last night.  I might need to use Loctite on all the bolts to keep them from loosening up.

Loctite is definitely a good idea.
