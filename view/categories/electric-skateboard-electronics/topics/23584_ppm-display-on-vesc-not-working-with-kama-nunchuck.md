Hey guys, so I plugged my VESC in for the first time and connected my kama Nunchuck. The Bluetooth transmitter is working and the connectings seem to be fine. However, when I boot up the BLDC, the PPM display does not show any throttle when I move the joystick......any ideas?

im pretty sure the nunchuck dosnt use ppm.You have to select nunchuck as the input and then set it up in the nunchuck tab, not ppm.

@JLabs is right the nunchuck has its own app in bLDC tool and PPM tab can't be used to configure it.
