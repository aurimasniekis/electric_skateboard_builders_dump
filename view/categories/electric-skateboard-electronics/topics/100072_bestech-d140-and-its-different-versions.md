Hi guys,

I got this 12S Bestech D140 BMS a while back and comparing this to the one you can buy at BKB or anywhere else there are significant less parts on it!? Are there several versions of the 12S D140 or are those simply different iterations? I am a bit confused ....

Cheers!

How mine looks like:

I was worried about that too once. Yours is for less charging amps. They range from 5 to 15 amps or perhaps more even.
