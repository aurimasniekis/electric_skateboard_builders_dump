Per the Enertion customer service they suggested I lube up the bearings. I did that in the second video yet the wheel isnâ€™t as smooth as the other wheel. Do I need to take both bearings off and soak them in alcohol or is the motor bad? 

Thank you for your help.

For better reference my latest post on Reddit has sparked some conversation.

I'm just trying to figure out if I need a replacement motor.

Thank you.
