Is that water damage/ residue on the 4th picture?

Might just be dust

I’ve determined that the focbox is ok, but the motor still sounds weird

When breaking did you hear the noise? For going it’s fine but it failed me on a steep hill going down 
The short I’m thinking melted something inside so ima check it out
It sounds like the inturnals of the moter are grinding against the can but with where I am right now I don’t have the tools to take a look...
