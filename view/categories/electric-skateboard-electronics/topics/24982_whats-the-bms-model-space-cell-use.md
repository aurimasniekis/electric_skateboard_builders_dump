Hi all, 

I purchased the SPACE cell (1st gen i believe) from Enertion last year and finally put my board together this spring. After a few rides it seems like it won't charge any more. It still power on and power the VESC and motor, it just won't charge when it is plugin. I have tested the power supply and confirmed that is not the issue. Any idea how should i trouble shoot it? Also, does anyone know what's the model number or how can i get the model number for the BMS if i need to replace it?

Does the battery percent display go up to 100 when plugged into the board and back to 0 when unplugged?

From your picture looks like it's outputing 25.8v which is closer to 6s voltage (25.2v). Are you sure you didn't pick up a different charger on accident? A 10s charger should be outputting 42-42.5v

Ya. The output is 25.5v on the charger.....let me check I might have grabbed the wrong one. Purchased so many battery packs over the year.
