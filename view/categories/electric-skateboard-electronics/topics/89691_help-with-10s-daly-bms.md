Well, neither do we

We need the connection diagram for your BMS, but there's a decent chance that if you connected it and it hasn't melted... You *MAY HAVE* got it right 

check with someone else here first ðŸ˜‚

The B- pin is on the left so the cell count will go from left to right in the picture. 
You got that right.
 
How you connect the main leads together and to the bms is also just as important. You need to show us that as well. 
Normally, you use the red wire from battery 1 for cell 5. Not the ground wire from battery 2.
