So i noticed on some screenshots of VESC settings that the battery min amps (regen) is lower (absolute value) than the motor min amps.  I live in very hilly city, 250 vertical meters between me and the city so i want to maximize how much regen i can get under sustained braking.  

I'm looking at running dual 192kv 6374s on 10s and the batteries i'm interested in are turnigy nanotech 5s 5000ah http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=17255
I'm interested in them because they have amaximum charge rate of 8c meaning i should be able to give them more amps in regen.

apart from getting better range by using more regen (i'm not an expert here) but when you're at the top of a hill you have potential energy and when you go down and come to a stop you either convert it to electrical energy in the battery or heat dissapated by the motors.

Anyone got experience with this kind of thing? or ever wondered about it post your thoughts/ ideas/ research/ stories
