Ok some in now looking for a bms to put along side my pack to allow for easier chargeing. 

https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/331949481204 

That's the bms and would bypass it for discharging but just want to double check its suitable for lipo charging with the right amp and current.

Or this one

the first one is not suitable for lipos! 

second one looks good for charging. but its not suitable for discharging (40amp max discharge current is to low for our 6s currentmonsters)! as you said you only use it for charging you wonÂ´t have problems.
