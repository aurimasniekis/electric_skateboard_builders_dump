hi guys this is the link for my google drive, it contains the Windows and OS X BLDC TOOL and Video Logger applications, i keep them up to date and currently are ready for FW 1.10 that vedder updated just 2 days ago,

i keep older versions of the software available just incase there are bugs with new FW, also for this who don't have a boot loader FW like version 1.2.

i also have a FW and config folder that i want to keep updated, so if any one has a motor configuration that they want share please sent it to me and ill add il to the folder.

as for updates if you update your FW and your BLDC TOOL can't use it and i haven't updated it please just contact me and let me know and ill work on fixing this asap.
