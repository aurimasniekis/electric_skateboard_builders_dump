So I have a 245kv motor that I dont want to waste.
I happen to have an extra 3s lipo and wanna go to 9s on my vesc from 6s ona 15:36 ratio, 83mmm wheels to get torque.

Now chaka in his post (pic) states that 9s on 245 kv is around ideal (as other combos of kv to S).

Mythical creatures:
1) 245kv with 9s -did anyone ride one?
2) 60000 erpm limit - will this defs prevents vesc damage and has anyone done this 

Sorry for the long post, heres a jet potato

245kv at 9s does put you over the ERPM limit.
I have heard that you can limit the erpm in the bldc tool to protect the vesc but I haven't personally tried it 
so I can't say for sure

I've been riding 240kv on 10S for several months using the ERPM limit in the bldc tool without a problem
