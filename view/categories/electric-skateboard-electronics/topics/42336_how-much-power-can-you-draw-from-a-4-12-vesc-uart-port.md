Title says it all

Basically trying to figure out if I can power an Arduino Mega, with leds, from the vesc's uart port or is this just too much?

I'm no expert but I believe it's 5v 1a.

How much power would that be in mA?

Ok, thank you @mmaner!

@scepterr thats 1000 mA so it sound like it might be enough. I'll have to try I guess and see, haha.

Lol no not how many mA is 1A LMAO
How many mA are your power requirements?

I can't remember exactly, the draw of the vesc itself is like 200-300mA?

Seems you might need to step up the voltage. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/6/26b3ea16b5b8c54e9e0cf71caa152296dfa07240.png" width="690" height="80">

oh, haha. I'm not quite sure yet. It seems like the aurdino is about 200 mah, not sure about everything else.

Working on what I think could be the real solution for good headlights, brake lights, and tail lights, combined with multiple vesc bluetooth.

With the Mega, I can have up to 4 serial connections, so 4wd or 2wd could have data combined for sending to your smart phone.

Also will be integrated with an oled display to put on top of your board to give on board data.

Really, I would like to think of it as the central computer of the board. The vesc's control the motors still, but all data is passed to this central computer so we can use it for lights, displaying, and to combine data between vesc's to be sent to your smart phone.

Don't you get access to all vescs via can if using Bluetooth only on master?

No, you only get data from the master vesc then. So if your using it on a 2wd or 4wd, your only getting data from 1 vesc.

If you check out the firmware code, specifically the commands.c file, you'll see that there is no way setup already to share data between the vesc's, beside erpm, which is used for traction control.

No one has yet to create a system that conbines all of the data together. You can "guess" you'll see the same current between the motors, but again, that's a guess. You won't get accurate numbers, and this is what some of the phone apps offer.

i've used around 500-800ma from the servo line 5v. 
not sure if theres a difference on the uart pinout.

this could help with the multiple vescs thing, but i haven't tested it yet.

Also, why don't you use the +5V from the PWM Port? I always did that with my arduinos and it should deliver 1A for sure.

Thanks for the link, I'm trying to get that code working right now actually. Been getting this error though:

fatal error: arduino.h: No such file or directory.

I had the leds up and working in minutes, but this piece has been a bit more difficult since I couldn't just install it like a library and have it work...

The reason for using the uart for power is because it'll mean less plugs. Trying to create a box essentially that has a bunch of ports for you to plug everything into. So master vesc + slave vescs each will have their own uart in port (master would then power the whole systems), then a front led port, back light port, and oled display port.

Like a multirotor! Good thinking! This project has a lot of potential and im interested in seeing where it goes.

i really gotta figure out some way to split the uart port 3 ways...

wanna run bluetooth module
wanna use the firefly remote
wanna use some turn signals

Well the Arduino Mega has 4 sets of serial input and ouput.

Mix this with some led lights, and the right controller, and there you go :P

Not in the size I want though. I need these small pieces for integrating into the deck. I have 2 sample hollow core decks coming in within the next month hopefully, so I'm hoping to put these into the ends of the board :)

Just buy one of these and attach it to your battery. It's cheap and provide decent to power any sort of things on different voltages. https://hobbyking.com/nl_nl/yep-20a-hv-2-12s-sbec-w-selectable-voltage-output.html

I'm working on something similar :stuck_out_tongue: 
It will be a central control station, and accepts the Photon receiver as an Add-on.

Sounds like some kind of library error, man i hate that with Arduino. Sometimes it helps to start from scratch using the example sketch provided by the library. 


I'm currently working on a nrf and Gt2B based OLED remote and settled for using only one VESC as is want to keep the receiver as small as possible. Since each VESC receives the same PWM Signal it should be fairly accurate to just count the relevant stats double.

If the motors are the same kv, then yes. But if the motors kvs are slightly different, you will pull different amounts of amps, and most are. Getting the same kv on the dot requires accuracy that most motor manufacturers can't replicate.

For example, they say a motor is 180 kv. The first could be 178 kv, the second might be 183 kv. 5 kv is enough to throw your numbers off a fair amount, especially if your drawing high amps or running higher kv motors.

Thank you for the idea, I will try that. THe whole reason though I was trying to stay away from something like that is becuase I wanted to keep things simple for end users to install.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Vesc controls by current and not by voltage. You set the current the Vesc is supposed to put out so it shouldn't matter that much.

I have put 2 different kv motors side by side with 2 different computer hooked up to them, and seen a difference in amp draw. Maybe this is due to watt control mode, but I don't think its that safe of an assumption. If you use a higher kv motor, you'll need more amps to get the same torque at the same voltage.

Even if they were to be exactly the same, it would help for trouble shooting to see the data coming from each vesc. The fault codes, and other data is still useful.
