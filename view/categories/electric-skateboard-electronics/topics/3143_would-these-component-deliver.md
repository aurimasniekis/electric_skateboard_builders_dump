Hi everyone. I've been reading and reading, and now I have some questions, and I would also like a final word on my choice of components. I would like to know if these components can deliver a real world performance of approx. 30-35km/h, as well as nice torque. 

**My components:**
**Motor:** Turnigy SK3 245kv
**Batteries:** Turnigy 4S 5000 mAh 25C (2x) 
**ESC:** *Probably* the VESC, but other suggestions would be great
**Receiver:** Not decided yet, but should not have an impact on performance. 
**Gearing:** Motor pulley teeth: 15t, wheel pulley teeth: 32t
**Mount:** *Probably* Enertion's mount, or a DIY copy.
**Wheels:** 83mm

Questions: 
Is 25C discharge rate too high (or too low)? 
If I go with 8000mAh, should I lower the discharge rate (or increase)? 
Should I go for 2x 6S instead, for this motor? Or what's the preferred combination of motor+battery without too many S's? 

I tried understanding the "C" thread as much as possible, but these are still my concerns. 
Any other suggestions are very welcome as this is my first build.
Thanks a lot in advance, *fraannk*

25c is just fine. if u get 8000mah then keep 25c dont chage it unless u go up
Edit: the vesc is still in the prototype phase so if u get it id run it on 8s for longevity. Finally get a gt2b rc controller 2.4 ghz

```
Basically the C rating is how many amps the battery can output. SO a 25c 5000 mah lipo can output a max of 125amps which is perfect.

And if I go 8000mAh, it will be 200 amps, and won't that be too much?
```

no it will still be fine u should be more worried about ur voltage the lower it is the more power u will need to draw and the easier it is to overheat components

Okay, I might go 8S then, to get a bit more voltage. :) Is 245kv on the motor too much? should I get the 213kv or 192kv?

I weigh about 72kg. I would like about 30-35km/h, and a fair bit of torque

i think ud be fine even if you were going up hills 190 is considered a safe zone and garunteed to basically work for everyone.
```

## \#10 Posted by: fraannk Posted at: 2016-05-11T23:09:11.668Z Reads: 79

So would you prefer the 190 or 245?
Thanks, you're being really helpful :D

i weigh 120 and ur not a hevy weight urself so id suggest 245 so u can also get a bit more speed and no problem bro

Fantastic! So 245kv motor, 2x 4S batteries, and 15T, 32T enertion gear/mounting stuff would make a great functioning board then? This is my very first build, so I just want to make sure.

haha we all worry on our first build. However to help u build the best board for uself i need u to give me ur budget and what u want to use it for

I'm thinking 500 euros max for the electronics and mounting stuff. Longboard and maybe trucks/wheels etc should be excluded in the budget :)
and I would use it to travel about 5km to work every day

alright then so i will recommend the 149 kv sk3 as all other motors are out of stock rn plus the 149kv has an insane amount of torque and is basically garunteed to work.
```

## \#16 Posted by: fraannk Posted at: 2016-05-11T23:18:48.508Z Reads: 72

And I would still get 30-35km/h top speed? Don't mind about stock, since nothing is in stock in the EU warehouses...

Yeah, already looking at that. After going through different combinations with 8S (since I would like to stay there), it seems the sweet spot would be the 192kv 6374, no? I'm thinking either that one or the 245 to get the top speed I want, or am I wrong? :)
Edit: And also according to this thread: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/choosing-the-right-motor-kv-for-the-vesc/3125 it seems either the 192 or 245 would be the sweet spot for 8s? :)

Edit: No more posts for me today :( If you see this, I would like to stay at 8s because i think 10s might be a little overkill for me.. Also because of the prototype VESC as you stated in post 1 :)

Well do u want to run 10s instead of 8s for lower amp draw?

Hi @fraannk! I know we all got confused when we built our first board. I built my first board 5 months ago and it is working still working excellent. I am running the SK3 245 motor with 6S (Zippy 3S 5000mAh 20C) and GPS tested my top speed which was about 42km/h on a flat surface (fully charged batteries). <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/9d7fb056155964d62d6a8f77b27469cdd21c9978.PNG" width="690" height="387"> I am rocking with 16t motor pulley and 36t wheel pulley. If you don't want that top speed I would suggest getting a 13/14t motor pulley instead. I weigh 78kg and it takes me up some steep hills if I just get some speed before (10-15kmh). Hope this helps. :)

@willpark16 If I could keep it at 8s it would be great. :) 

@karma That's exactly the setup I was thinking about! :D How's the range? And what ESC, and do you set a power draw limit on that?

hmm ud have to gear the 149 hih or wait for a 190 or 192kv motor to pop up

None of them are in stock in EU anyways, so no matter what I'll have to wait. Would you still go for a 190/192 over a 245? Would I get enough top speed with that? :)

I am getting about 7km on my batteries, that is while going quite fast and up some hills. I have [this](product/single-motor-120a-6s-esc/) ESC from @torqueboards. It's working great and it never gets warm due to the fan.

How is it handling acceleration from stop? And are there any limiter so the motor won't eat as much as possible, as stated as a problem in one of the "read this first"-threads

So far so good. Ordered a VESC as well as SK3 245KV and 2x 4s 5000mAh :D now i need a longboard, mounts etc

You can go from stop, though it doesn't feel nice and it is putting some unnecessary stress on your board. Just take a kick or two and then start giving some throttle.  The ESC i linked has some protection features: " â€“ Low voltage cut-off protection, Over-heat protection, Throttle signal loss protection." You can just read all about it on the site.
