Hello Gents,

Got everything connected....now looking for assistance getting the remote set up.  I got a red quick flashing light and no action with the remote.  Did a quick search on the site and didn't see any post around set up.  

Can someone direct me on how I can set up the Enertion Remote with the VESC via the BLDC tool?  Thanks!

More or less you will need to switch on / enable the PPM control. You can find it within one of the tabs. If you enable this with current control / duty cycle / current control no reverse with brake (which I recommend) you will be able to control your VESC and motor. There are some videos how to do this.

Try a different channel.  If you have red flashing on left led you should be all good to go.
