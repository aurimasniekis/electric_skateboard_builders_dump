Hey I'm having some questions on how to implement the Sparkle mod. I'd hoped that I could post them here and some experienced DIY'ers could help me out.

First question how do I get the trigger to fit the green print plate makes it so it doesn't fit.

Thanks!

Oh another one I suppose you have to cut off some of this circuit board to make it fit? How and where?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/5/d50c9eb92c83be60768cfe379e1a2f0eced4d9cd.jpg" width="281" height="500">

Look at my tutorial on the MasterCho mod. Some similar stuff http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/gt2b-mastercho-chozen-mod-full-length-tutorial-how-to/16005/11. As for the first question, you simply bend it flat. I have pictures on this. For the second one, you may have to cut the edge of it. Go very slow with a Dremel cutting disk and you will be fine.
