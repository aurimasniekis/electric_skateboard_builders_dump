Hey guys, sorry if something similar has been posted/asked, but I'm confused about getting a bms for my 8s 2p (4x 4s 5000mAh batteries) https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-4s1p-14-8v-20c-hardcase-pack-1.html (these exact ones). I'm not sure what bms to get (I want to bypass discharging and only use the bms for charging) and how to wire it up.

Just use the search bar for the first kick in

There a ton of threads about it.
Bestech always makes good bms.

Go through the the threads, choose a bms, make a wiring diagram.
If you than still unsure about something just post it and we will have a look about it
