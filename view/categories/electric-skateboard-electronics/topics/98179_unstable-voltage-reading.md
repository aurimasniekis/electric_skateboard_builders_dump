Hi,

My vesc is reading a voltage level that is flickering very quickly through some values around the correct value. I've used a multimeter to check the voltage coming into the vesc and that reading seems to be fine. Does this mean something is faulty with my vesc?

Thanks

What vesc do you have? If it's flipsky, then it's common.

Its also common for focboxes. That's why in the newest metr release they implemented a smoothing of these readings.
