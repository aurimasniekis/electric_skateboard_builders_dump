I need help.  My knowledge of lipo battery is very limited and I hope ppl here can help me figure out what is wrong with my lipo battery pack.    The pack is 11.1v 3s 5500mah pack.  I accidentally short circuited  the battery and causes a few sparks last night.  I checked all the connections and everything seems fine.  I used a battery checker and it still reads 3s with charges of 3.98v, 3.97v and 3.96v.   But when I try to balance charge it the charger gives me a battery connection problem error.  My changer should be working fine because I am able to charge other batteries.    Thank you.

not sure what you thing might be.. if voltage alarm/voltage monitor shows up the voltages..

Do you have the main plugs connected correctly? (are they connected / in contact with charger?

Check for voltage at the main wires. One of them may have lost connection during the short

Thank guys.  Yes one of the battery connector and a charger connector got fried and solder melted.   A few days ago I have 2 battery accidents and I became paranoid about lipo batteries.  Its pretty scary to have 2 6s batteries shorting out.  It caused a lot of damages to my wireing.   I spent the 5 hours checking and

Lipos are totally fine if you're careful enough and always remember protect wires you are not working. Put some tape on them.
