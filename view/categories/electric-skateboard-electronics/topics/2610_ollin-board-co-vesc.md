If Ollin board co or anybody who can answer my question is reason this any info would be helpful. 
I purchased a VESC with the heats ink and the nyko karma adapter. I know that he makes them by hand and I really don't want to rush or annoy him, I just want an estimate as to how long he takes to ship an order out. I switched to his VESC (from another seller) because it said it was in stock and ready to ship (also looked like it was better quality with more options). Any info is helpful. Thanks

I ordered 2 VESC with heat sinks from ollin board & co. I placed the order on April 5. They shipped the product on April 18th. The main reason for the delay is the heat sink package (btw I don't mind the delay).  Right now the product has reached India (Place I live). I guess I will get the product in a day or two.

Hope it Helps :)

I would agree about the shipping time. Took about a week and some before shipping. At the end of the day, it's still fast considering they are made by hand. And the quality is well worth the wait. Compared to other VESCs, they felt and looked solid. And are working like rockstars.

Hello @Hawkmoon269 

All orders will be shipped by the end of the week. We made a big push on fabricating the heat sink parts in bulk since everyone has been adding them to their orders lately. Tracking numbers will start hitting your in-boxes throughout the week.

Yes I still place components by hand but they are soldered in a reflow oven with precise temperature control ;)

I ordered two non-heat sink VESCs in early April and received them last week. You won't regret your decision...These things ooze quality craftsmanship and attention to detail.

@chaka I have an order for two VESCs w/ heatsinks and a Badwolf mod that I placed in January.  I think it got lost in the shuffle.  Is there any chance that my order will be shipped by the end of this week too?

There is noting more relaxing than manually assembling the VESC :D.

Very nice! Did you do that with tweezers alone? I would be lost without my little vacuum tool.

Thanks, credits to you as well assembling all those by hand! I only assemble by hand when I am inpatient or with prototypes xD. Then indeed all with tweezers, accept for BGA's, those I have to do with vacuum ( which I generate by sucking on a hose, don't laugh :smile: ). Luckily not many projects of my contain BGA packages, when they do:

Looks like we made an error on our shipping labels guys. Staying up till 3 in the morning packing orders might have had something to do with that.  Melissa squared everything out this morning with the post clerk and your tracking numbers should start sending some info.

Reviewed mine today also. It's truly a work of art. Functioned perfectly only had to change the brake force, battery cut off, and cut a hole for the nyko remote. Took my board out for a spin, got to confident and crashed at 25mph+ lol. Amazing torque and response, just need to tweak it a bit so that the remote is not so freaking sensitive (fell off bc I the acceleration is ridiculous). Thanks again Chaka<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7601f3e51bb7d1626baa4c47e937dd2d5746b97e.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Hey @DilatedPupils I have been wanting to contact you. Please know we get tons of messages everyday  in various forums and message boards. If we are a little silent at times it is because we have all hands on deck building controllers and battery packs. 

Your package was showing in the usps system as of Monday.

Just wanted to say how f-ing great oillinboard's costumer service is...
I had my VESC for about 3 weeks trying out my first board with different battery configurations etc. the VESC worked perfectly then I went to wire everything peremently and in my haste I wired a XT-60 backwards and fried my VESC.
I KNOW... I'm an idiot. 100% my fault nothing that would be covered under any warrantee I've heard of.

I emailed Chaka explained the situation and said I'd like to pay for a repair, he said send it in and he'd look at it, well he fixed and wouldn't let me pay or the labor he just asked for shipping. I couldn't believe it, here is a company spending time and resources  to correct my mistake, now that's standing by your product.

Thanks Chaka!

Lesson #2 have a second Esk8 or back up esc cause the days without the ride were painFULL!

I'm glad to hear these stories, but I've had 2 VESCs ordered nearly 4 weeks ago and still don't know what the status of them are :( I got a generic response from his support team 2 weeks ago, but still no eta. I sent another message 5 days ago but haven't heard back. It's not super critical that i get them ASAP since I'm waiting for my space cell, but it'd be nice to know my order is still there

Surprised to hear that.  They've always gotten back to me within a couple days
I'd say try again make sure to include your order#
I do know they're  a little backed up now cause they're the only pace in the states to get a VESC right now, but 4 weeks sounds like something is wrong

Hey @Jinra 
Your order includes a motor so it will ship as soon as they come in. If you have sent an email please send it again and your question will be answered. Messages on this forum sometimes go unanswered  but I do my best to get all of them. I am on vacation for the weekend but I'll be back in the shop on Tuesday. I do remember that your vesc is completed so you will have your hardware by the end of the week.
