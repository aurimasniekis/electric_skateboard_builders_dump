As the title says I fried one of my foc boxes during my first test. Since I can't buy these from enertion anymore is there another vender that has 1 in Stock?

And yes it melted both motor wires off. I have to assume that it would be my own stupidity even after triple checking the vesc tool settings and going through multiple videos. ![IMG_20190804_172620|375x500](upload://jJ0x3wYYSW9OWxogKLV7yIh1sQo.jpeg)

No faults in terminal, I got it home and powered it up and plugged it into pc and no faults detected I wasn't even sure if it was going to power on
