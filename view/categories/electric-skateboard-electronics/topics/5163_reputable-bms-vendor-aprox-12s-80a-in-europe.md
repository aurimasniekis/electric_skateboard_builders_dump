As we all know, import taxes from outside of the EU are darn expensive: 20% of the value of the item + â‚¬20 administration cost. 

I've been looking for a 18650 vendor (but I think I've found one nikon.nl) and a BMS vendor that is located in the EU, as I'm looking into making a 12s3p pack for a dual hub setup (pff this hobby is starting to get expensive :p). Sadly I can't find any

Anyone with any tips?

Batterysupports ebay shop.
They ship as "samples of PCB" with a stated value of 25 EUR which is below the value you have to pay VAT as a private person.
