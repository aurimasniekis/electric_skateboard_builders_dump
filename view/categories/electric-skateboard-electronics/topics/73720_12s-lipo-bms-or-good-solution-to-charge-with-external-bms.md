Looking to do a 12S 2x6S Lipo battery pack, and it seems to be a bit harder to find any BMS that would work for this application.

It will just be used to charge it, does anyone know any that will be good for it or a solution so i can maybe charge it without a BMS inside my board.

Its for a Trampa so i dont want to take it out of the board when i need a charge.

batterysupports has 12s BMS, or you can use a small 12s discharge only BMS from bestech like i do.
