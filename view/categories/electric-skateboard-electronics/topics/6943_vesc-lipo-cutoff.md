I'm completely new to the vesc. Does it do lipo voltage cutoff? Do I have to buy lipo voltage alarms? Thanks.

It has voltage cutoff limit,<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/8ee7a2c2240bcffade6d0fab68875629ab6b767e.png" width="690" height="393">

@Lizardking0069 you don't need voltage alarms. Use BLDC Tool to set voltages for starting point for cutout, and then a final cutout. It works really well. The only drawback is that you don't have a real-time view of your voltage while you're riding. You can install a voltage meter for external viewing if you need it.

Indeed. I would even say that anyone who's using a VESC should watch pretty much every video on that channel.

Someone suggested buying this one in another thread:

Do you know of a US supplier for it?

I bought one from ebay from a supplier in Hong Kong. It should take some time to get here 3-4weeks.
