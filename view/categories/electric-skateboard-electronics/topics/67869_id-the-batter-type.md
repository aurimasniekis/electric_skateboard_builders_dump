Anybody know where to get the type of battery used in this deck?
I've been looking for a slim battery and this one looks to be just  1 - 1.5cm deep Lipo.

I don´t know this battery, but you can open every
lipo and flat them down.
in a 3s lipo for example 3 slim cells which you could
just lay out next to each other.
There is a entire thread about it here.
If I´ll find, I´ll link you.
