I am trying to figure out the logistics. 
So, I have done the calculations and to get 12 s.
190 kv with 50 volt battery that is 2 packs of 6 cells.
I want to have a 3:1 gear ratio. Don't know that part.
 What motor should I go with in spec. I am not asking for a review of motors. I just want to see what rating my motor should have to handle a 12 s? Also wondering what a good set up for the batteries? ex parallel series?

At 100% efficiency The erpm will be 63500, but you will likely never hit this, unless you go full throttle downhill
