Hey guys I have a dual belt set up with a Focbox Unity.  I have this weird situation where one of my motors sounds like it's running in FOC and the other one sounds like it's running in BLDC.  I'm told that the unity defaults to running in FOC and that the order of the motor phase wires connecting to the unity doesn't matter. Is that true?  Am i hearing things?

Perhaps try switching the connection between vesc/motor and see if the noises also switch.

Order of phase wires does not matter üòÅ
