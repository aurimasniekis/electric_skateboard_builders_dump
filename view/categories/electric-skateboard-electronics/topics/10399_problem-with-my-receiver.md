Hi everyone! I used my e-skate for one month every day now and it works like charme! 

In the last two days unfortunately I got this problem: when I turn on the skate the trigger of my controller works only once and it keeps working as long as the skate is moving. 
If I stop or slow down than the trigger stop working and the only thing I can do is to turn my controller off and than on again.

Do you know what could be the cause for this?

Thanks in advance

What brand is the transmitter and receiver? Are you using VESC?
