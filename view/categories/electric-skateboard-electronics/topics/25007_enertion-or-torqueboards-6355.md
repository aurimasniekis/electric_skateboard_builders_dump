i am in possession of enertion and torqueboards 6355 190kv motors, two of each.

it seems [torqueboards are better at torque, enertion top speed](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/whats-the-best-motor/8712/2?u=thisguyhere) (?), but wanted to see what i should go with.

top speed is good but i'm hitting hills so it's all about torque for me.

yes, i know speed and torque can be controlled by gearing, i have [15-40 pulleys](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lower-price-15mm-steel-motor-pulley-40t-abec-flywheel-mbs-all-terrain-pulley/16586) right now.

Um so what's your question? You already have the motors.

My bad, should have mentioned, I'm gonna sell one set to recoup costs, just seeing which ones to keep and sell.

If you're torn, keep one of each

I think you answered your own question.
"torque boards are better at torque"
"I'm hitting hills so it's all about torque for me"

Should have kept one of each. Best of both worlds.

Initially yes, then realized tb's 218mm trucks have enough room for dual 6374s, so got them instead. 

Put the 6355s on sale

Well, Dual  6355's  vs   Dual 6374's  
I would say no contest regardless of brand.
Btw, I got my TB 218 trucks and a pair of APS 200kv 6374's arriving next week !!!!

Thought so, $90 for two new R-Specs would be ridiculous!

Any updated info on the 218mm trucks? I want to run my 6374's dual rear instead of diagonal.

I've been lagging on my dual 6374 setup. I've heard that it works with up to 12mm belts.
I'm gonna try it with 9mm belts

Moving incredibly slow on the new build, but preliminary measurements shows dual 6374 with 15mm belts fits. Going to try to complete this build tomorrow so will report back with results, and like a 45 minute, 3 part build vids for yootoob.
