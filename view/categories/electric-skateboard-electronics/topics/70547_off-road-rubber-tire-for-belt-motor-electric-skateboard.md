This...

The holes keep the weight down and give  aspringiness to the wheel that otherwise wouldn't be there.  I'd personally rather see a flywheel style core, but either is fine since its aluminum.  Im looking forward to trying these, I honestly cant say if they will be great or not, but I feel like they will at least be good.

Also yes to the flywheel core.

Soooo with these wheels if your a heavier rider you will definitely get a lot of resistance, also the standard size bearings (22mm) dont fit you would have to mill out some of the aluminum core for proper fitment. Other than that they are super smooth & grippy and weight about the same as abec 107mm (don‚Äôt have a scale). I would have to ride them more to see how they hold up on real world roads and not my neighborhood nicely paved roads lol... but I did ride them on the sidewalk for a bit and even then they were smooth... ![image|666x500](upload://rDiwWmNu5IVIxgO7sauYEiDY5an.jpeg)

@Phoenix-liuqiu mentioned they fit standard 608 bearings. Which bearings did you have trouble fitting? 

Really don't like the idea of milling anything since I don't have the mechanical tools/knowhow to do so, would be a dealbreaker for me.

Yeah I used the standard bearing 8mm bore 22mm diameter.... I can tell it was cut to fit the bearing but spacing is really bad to get the bearing to fit... it would require a bit of milling.. or maybe it was just the set I received ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.. you can get yourself a Dremel tool and do in like 10mins not hard at all...

If the motor is on the front, this direction is correct.
If the motor is on the back, this direction is wrong, the wrong direction of the tire tread
Tread pattern is used to guide water

I think the range will be affected, on the other hand you will have better grip. It's matter of what you are looking for. They look pretty decent for the price and if the damp vibration and bad roads, I am fine if the range is affected a bit. it means that they have a great grip compare to PU wheels. For sure these wheels are not made for pushing them :grin:

You said your wheels fit standard bearings.

How do you know which orders are in-shipping that require _milling_?

So, I drove them for 3/4 miles. They are pretty amazing. I live in SF in downtown some streets are awful. The front wheels absorbed every thing. Was a pleasure. However, this batch has the bearing issue, and the spacer for the bearings is a little short. On the vibration side, when you carve (so you‚Äôre on the wheel side) you still feel some minor vibrations. Not a big deal for me. They seems to roll slightly better and I think they‚Äôre lighter than the A one because they‚Äôre less wide.

To piggyback onto this, how does it compare in terms of range/comfort to abec 107's(or other biggest urethane wheel you've used)?

Also do you go out to baeske8 rides? Would love a chance to see those wheels live in the wild

I wonder how these perform in the rain. I've had bad experience with urethane.

Did you intentionally mounted those wheels like that? Those front wheels should be switched. The core is offset and longer overhang should be facing outside. Unless you want narrower profile.

Just got 2 sets to EU... Somehow without customs :sweat_smile:. Guess that makes up for missing the discount. 

Just need to wait for black Friday deals for large Kegel pulleys cause 110eur is a bit steep...

For my set, the standard bearing fit fine. One of the seat felt tiny bit loose but no rattle or play detected while riding. But, I also experienced the spacer they provide is short by 1mm or so. That used to rattle like crazy. One speed ring fixed those issues and now it rides perfect. Only downside I've seen is quite a significant reduction in range due to higher rolling resistance. Guess you can't have both comfort/grip and efficiency. So far, these have been great on Boosted.

Why would you have the longer overhang facing outside? I also bought these wheels and had mounted them the same way as Bob's picture.

There's some rubber smeared on them and the drilled holes need some sanding but idc about cosmetics like these. As long as the bearings fit properly and there is no wobbling.

Mine (the new set they sent) started to rattle after 2/3 days. I think that we need some sort on sleeve on the bearing because aluminum on steal doesn‚Äôt seal well. Ideas?

Overhang further absorbs road irregularities. Not that these wheels need it much due to round profile. Kegel core is offset and overhang should be outside. I expect this wheel to have the same design purpose. But, there's no rule against it, if you want narrower profile it works too.

How do they feel compared to something like a 107 flywheel? If you've had that comparison experience.

I'm less interested in grip and more in soaking up bumps on the pavement.

Personally, I haven't ridden 107mm, but I have 97mm 76a Reflex formula ABEC11, and Strom Esk8 wheels are A LOT more cushy. Almost too much to be honest because now the rolling resistance seems a little too high. But, if you want cushy and smooth rolling wheel that grips like pneumatic on Kegel core, there's nothing like these. These work very well for rough roads. And, the machining is good enough to work well at least for me. The rubber/alu interface is not very cleanly finished but it's pretty minor. I might fill up some of the holes to make it less cushy and for more range. Another difference from PU is noise. There no noise while rolling and when hitting cracks and bumps at speeds. Only motor sound. I think it's great.

Thank you for that, I think you helped me make my mind up and try them out. They are going on a last mile board and will likely make up half the total weight but that's not too much of a concern because I lift babies all day and dead weight sleeping babies make the gym look like a playground :rofl:
