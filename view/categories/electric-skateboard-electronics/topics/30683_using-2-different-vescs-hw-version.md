Hi,

Will I have a problem running dual motors with different HW version vescs?
One vesc is Greenmotion 4.12 and Second one is 4.10 Enertion Vesc.
Planning to connect them to the receiver with Y splitter cable and running in BLDC mode.

Thanks!

I will be using @Ackmaniac's Custom BLDC tool, so the versions will match.
Thanks :)
