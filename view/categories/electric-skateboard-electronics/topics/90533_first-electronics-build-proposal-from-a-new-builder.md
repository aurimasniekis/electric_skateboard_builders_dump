Hi newbie here trying to put together my first electric skateboard build. After some basic research Iâ€™ve come up with the following electronic set up.

ESC: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/aerostar-advance-120a-esc-opto.html

Battery: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-high-capacity-battery-8000mah-4s-12c-drone-lipo-pack-xt90.html (two of these, planning to connect in series to make an 8s pack)

Motor: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-245kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html


Ive also looked into a balance charger for the batteries as I know Lipo batteries can be dangerous when charged uncautiously

Balance charger: [https://hobbyking.com/en_us/ecube-e4-with-us-plug.html ](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/ecube-e4-with-us-plug.html)

Am I missing anything glaringly horrid with this setup or is this a reasonable start point? Any advice as to what changes I should consider?

Thanks :slight_smile:
