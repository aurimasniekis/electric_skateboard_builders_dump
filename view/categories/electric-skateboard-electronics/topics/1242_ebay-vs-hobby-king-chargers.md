Looking on Ebay for chargers and HobbyKing and Progressive RC and I see a big price gap. 
Really cheap chargers:

and Hobby King:

Any reason why there is such a difference?

First one is probably a clone.
Second one is different alltogether.
Third one is a clone.
Hobbyking one is genuine.

You get what you pay... cheap stuff, cheap quality and most likely clones.

@Fishy the heuristic I use to make these decisions is: 

Can it start a fire if it malfunctions? 

If yes = don't buy a clone (chargers, batteries)

If no = it might be OK to try a clone (wheels, trucks, decks)

If you're planning to charge lipo with it, better take an original charger / seriously made charger. Lipo are prone to smoking / fire / explode during charging even without a good charger. Imagine how the risk adds up with an unknown charger supplier / fake ones. Added the risk of damaging the lipo / burn your house down. Hobbyking is cheap enough already, recommend you to get it from there.

I have 4 of the first ones and they all do the job just fine.

@Fishy I use this one, and it came recommended from other folks in our DIY community. I like it because it has a built-in power adapter so there is one less piece to deal with. http://www.hobbypartz.com/thac6smbachw.html

Yup, I have the exact same one, very happy with it. 
I've had it for 4 years now, nearly fried it a few times but still going strong.

hi, i have some question to ask about the charger.

i have 2 4s 5000mah 20c lipo battery, not yet buy the balance charger yet. 
due to budget tight, if i buy imax b6 mini, it only can charge 4s battery one by one. 
if i using parallel board to charge together, will it hurt battery? my fren told me that, if two battery difference voltage left, the higher voltage will charge to lower voltage. it will hurt the lower voltage battery. is it true?
if i using 5.0a to charge, it will take around one hour plus to fully charge rite?

or i need get bigger power charger? 
but for my mind set, i wan protect my battery well, will not charge over 5.0a (1c).
hope u can help me. i am setup my first build now.

Or i need spend more on bigger charger with duo charging feature? Passport ultra duo. 
thank you
Ben
