Hi All, I'm currently halfway through an upgrade to my old Evolve board and started getting curious about motor efficiency. Has anyone here measured motor efficiency using the round trip method or similar?

I think I might do this at some point. I have two motors SK8 6354, a bunch of pulleys and belts and 2 focboxes. I will print or machine a bracket and drive one motor with positive current and the other negative recording the net current into the battery. I am curious about the effect of belt tension, idlers, motor speed etc on total system efficiency. I also want to see how much power I can transfer from one motor to the other (for giggles).

For those who are interested, I mounted two SK8 motors to a bracket today and did some quick tests. One motor is being driven from a Unity, the other from a single FOCBOX. They both have 15T pulleys. I wanted to get an approximation of the round trip efficiency of this kind of setup for curiosity. The driving motor is set to a fixed speed and the braking motor is set to a fixed motor current. 

Does anyone have an idea of something else they would like to see tested? This is a link to the spreadsheet with the results.
