Has anybody tried the FatJay Chinese motors? If so, what is your verdict?

True, I do like the KV customization bit, if they allow it for single motors (seems that way) and not bulk , i might order from them next month.

I like the look of those motors actually but with anything Chinese its a lottery as to if it will be reliable or not.  Like the guard though.  Usually with that level of design thought you'd hope they would also be as fussy about Q&A.  Heres hoping.  I love that reply because that to me indicates they are standing by their products and service.  They're proud of that shit lol

It will be interesting to see the inside and the rotor/stator lenght !
I hesitate between 5065 Racerstar and this one ^^ I take the most used.

Haha, I've already discussed their feedback with them to try and establish if they're legit ... apparently the buyer didn't read the description properly and didn't actually select the motor they wanted from the "color" selection. The first image in the advert is the 190kv motor but the advert defaults to the 280kv option if you just add it to your basket. To be honest, I think I believe them. I've got a more "colourful" review of that particular buyer from the seller and it's hilariously awesome!

Anyway, I think I'm going to take a punt. I'm tempted by the 6368 190kv.

Exactly my thoughts. I'm in the same boat. The 5065 Racerstar are well used, well regarded and seem to return good bang for buck. However, these 63xx FatJays seem to be a bit of an unknown. 

If I get them, I will strip them down and immediately change the bearings to something SKF/Timken/NSK anyway so would take all the measurements when I do it. I'm an industrial engineer during the day and have a complex about cheap/unbranded/counterfeit bearings!

Haha, I'm not going to post it because it's obviously a translation/choice of words error (I think) :laughing:
