I just got the space cell and when i started to charge it crazy shit started to happen.
First it started to make noise and then it made sparks fly all over the place and it burned two fuses<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a16f41abb1efc2f354a952b6f92b0be35462240e.jpg" width="374" height="500">

@ArniJoronen show us, maybe there's an explanation we can derive. Also, could you explain further what you mean by "crazy shit?"

it probably actually was satan. We all know what happened on Phobos when the UAC tried to experiment with teleportation. If Shenzen is doing weird shit in those cells, it could have opened a portal... to HELL.

no the space cell doesn't come with a charger but if you buy the space cell and fast charger at the same time you get the fast charger cheaper.

What voltage is your wall outlet? 
What voltage did you select on the charger (red switch)?

Unfortunately I think you have them set wrong. That charger is now toast.

guarantee that's the issue.. 

probably set it at 110v and plugged it into a 220v outlet or vice versa.

the question is, which did you try first? 220v or 110v?

## \#21 Posted by: ArniJoronen Posted at: 2016-03-09T09:21:14.179Z Reads: 129

First the default I think it was 110 but then I switched fuses and tried again but the same thing happened.

Did you put in the same rated fuse? If yes and it is still goes boom, you're charger is toast.

If you plugged it in with the setting at 110v it will have burned out components on the first try, so setting it to 220v setting afterwards would not help.
Unfortunately.

Accidentally switched a PC power supply to 110v once, did much the same as your charger and remained dead after.

Id probably agree with @cmatson  Especially now that you confirmed you did it 110v first.

I feel for you as you probably waited awhile for the battery. The good news is you wont ever do it again for any other such devices, As Enertion are selling internationally the charger is going to be multi country use.

Its unfortunate for you.y

It depends on how it's built, some devices don't have fuse protection on the mains side, relying on the fuse box in your house if a short occurs.
The problem is it generally don't cause a short when you plug in a 110v based device to 220v mains, you just burn up some components inside.

```
In my personal opinion, the voltages should have been set correctly at the factory for their target addresses, and voltages for target addresses are a very simple and known quantity. Relying on customers to remember to check and change their own voltages probably isn't a good thing and will result in more issues just like this. Even PC power supplies ordered for the US come switched to 110. Hell i can't even get the right cord from the factory. Neither of the space cells i ordered for myself came with a charger cord for the US. I'm using one from a playstation, and one from a coffee maker. It makes me wonder if i should have opened all the ones i relayed to people in the US and checked them. Maybe I should have.

anyone would love to befriend this kid ! so hardworking ! watch !

also , an advice to the harworking kid , dont place charger near the space cell or any other items that can catch  those sparks . charger will get heated up , so place it in well ventillated area .

I'll arrange a new one... buy this and write a note saying what you want. http://www.enertionboards.com/how-to-build-eboard/custom-board-upgrade-charge/

a warning label to check the voltage is a good idea... ill also put a label on there to ask people to read the warning label :)

Warning label instructions. You have to cover the1%. People dont read instructions, but at least if you put all that with the product its buyer beware. Just saves everyone from having issues.

No the fuse is not designed to protect electronics. Fuses are in place to protect the user from electrocution or fire.

Manuals are a tool to reduce liability. Nobody ever reads anything, but you can say they should have, and that you included it, and it helps shift liability in the event of a claim. But no one ever reads a manual when faced with the excitement of opening and immediately using a product they've been waiting "a long time" for.

According to the enertion site the fast charger charges to 42v at 2amps

Maybe it has some safety features that are valued but I imagine all that is in the bms and all it really is is a power supply

I don't know what RCAF is but riddle me this:

what causes the high current surge?


nah don't answer, its rhetorical. I'm just going to go ahead and disagree with you and RCAF. (whatever that is)
