Hello,
this monday I received this esc from aps
https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/esc/alien-120a-2-12s-v4-factory-esc-hv-twin/
I plugged it in like so
![problem|690x350](upload://2GsHi4aX9fFInJOBIPIq5xC3QYn.png)
I turned it on, motors started doing *beep beep* sounds (normal)
when they stopped I used remote to see if the esc will make motors turn
one of the motors (Yellow cable) started making sound like it wants to spin but it didn't and few seconds later it started smoking
the other motor (Black cable) did nothing at all
my setup:

burned motor:

I don't know if esc or motor failed 
motors are 90mm hubs from Maytech, I used those with 12S before, with different esc and thay worked perfectly fine
anyone has an idea of why that happened?
PS. I didn't know I can be so annoyed, I was about to finish this build
