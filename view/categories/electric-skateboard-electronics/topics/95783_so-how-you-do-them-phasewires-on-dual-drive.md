Having a hard time wiring it up without the motors running against the wires, cant raise the motors and no more spacers.

Any tricks?

I see it's a front mount. I personally went reverse mount with duals so I could feed the wires through a custom 3D printed riser..

Yeah i was thinking about those but i cant really add any risers, or 3dprint :( 

I hate dual drives while i love them.

When i mount them forward i usually have to motor mounted so the phase wire come out of the can forward as well then they go straight into the box
