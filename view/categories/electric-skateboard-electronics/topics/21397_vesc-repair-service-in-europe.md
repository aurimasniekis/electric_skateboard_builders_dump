Hi, I was doing research about people offering VESC repair service in Europe, I stumbled upon LP Electronics but they seem to no longer offer this kind of service due to registered VESC trademark (why? I don't know), there was also a guy at vedders forum (@xlv) but it seems he deleted his account.

Does any of You know if anyone here offers such service? (preferably in Europe) I know @JohnnyMeduse does but he's in Canada .

LP Electonics is oob? They were really the life-saver guys! +probably the only one in EU.

That's smells like BS. Even if VESC is now a TM for him, the time when v4.x were built there was no TM at all, so those are legally produced and called as VESC (and having the name printed on the boards). So based on this they could keep offering the repair service for those boards, they just should call it VESC 4.x repair.
Or the TM is retrospective? 

...and even if it's a TM now, they could still offer non-official repair service for them. Will be there any warranty or similar and free repair service for now on for those VESCs that are covered by the TM? 
Even if yes, I think they could still offer unofficial repair service (what would void official warranty but that's still the owner's decision).
 
Did they got a message from Mr. Vedder to stop the service? That would be quite a rude step from him.

I don't want to choose any side here, just wrote what an official explanation stated on LP Electronics website is :) BUT seems You're kinda right, and I think Mr. Vedder it also to busy to deal with such things as TM personally.

From a legal point of view I cannot see what is the relationship between the trademark and a repair service. This explanation does not stand.

I think they just don't like bens business desicions and decided to not longer "support" this project, as i see no legal reasons.
