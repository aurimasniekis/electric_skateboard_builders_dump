Looking to find a replacement for the power button on my "meepo" / http://www.diyeboard.com board. Holding the power down works, but pressing it does nothing meaning when i reconnect the battery the board is constantly on. I don't know too much about electronics, but I can solder on/off components if required. the power button is a 4 pin, and has wires for power_key, 2x gnd and then an LED. It goes into this connector on the ESC http://prntscr.com/gptwi2

Let me know if you need any more details, thanks for any help

Search eBay for a hover board button. Or is the actual whole on/ off circuit broken?
