```
I have recently completed a build and I found the performance a bit underwhelming. I decided to optimize the vesc settings so I tried to connect my vesc to my computer. After a while i got it working so i decided to update the firmware. After this was done the board stopped working. It turns on but nothing happens and the remote controller connects. I dont get the same three blinking lights before i connect it to my computer. Right now i am basically stuck with a board that doesn't work so any help would be appreciated. Another thing to note is that when i tried to measure the L&R the board shut of after the motor made a sound, everything is fine and nothing got hot.

Edit: I have had this thread up for 12 days without any response so i would really appreciate any help possible.

Post screenshots of your VESC settings....

Do motor detection and when it doesnt go thru, go to the terminal tab and write "faults"

## \#11 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-08-02T14:50:37.050Z Reads: 65

```
That should be based on hw 4.12
You choose the wrong hw version while flashing firmware 
You can see it, itâ€™s written 48
But there should be different versions be available.
You need the one which fit to hw 4.10 4.12

In case you canâ€™t reload your vesc you need to look here in the forum. Could be that you can load it with the bootloader and st link

No problem.
Where you got the software from?
I mean where you downloaded the vesc tool?
On your picture you sent i can see that the right firmware not in the vesc folder.
Unfortunately I donâ€™t know which folder it need to be (name and ending).
So, my easy way would be,
Ask here in the forum, or uninstall the vesc tool,
Go on the official vesc homepage and download again the service software.
Than open the vesc tool. Under firmware there should be not only 48, also 410,412 and some other hw should show up there.
Try this. If thatâ€˜s not functioning let me know.
Iâ€™ll have a look where to find the files.

You have hw4.12 if I remember right.
So you need the firmware 410 411 412.
Last one

Look just connect your vesc
Open the vesc tool
Go to firmware 
Choose 410 411 412
Push the upload firmware button 
And hope that your vesc after change to the right firmware. You now have the firmware which fit to hw 48 but thatâ€™s not the right you need

Ok i have overseen one pic...
So itâ€™s normal that you get this firmware too old message 
If you click ok you can upload the firmware?
Or you just see the 48 version after?

Look through this thread 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hay-i-accidentally-flashed-the-wrong-firmware-on-my-vesc-help/42928?u=andy87

I didnâ€™t read through all of it but I think you have the same problem.
More down there should be a description how you can fix it. 
Could be that you need a st-link to get you back to the right firmware

[quote="danielz, post:32, topic:42928, full:true"]
Flash the entire firmware bin with stlink instead of just the bootloader. Thats why i did. I got the firmware from the bldc tools program files directory. Then after i fired up vesc tool and it updated to the latest.

Looks like i would need a st-link to fix it which seems taunting

Yes but thatâ€™s how it is.

You could also ask here, maybe somebody will borrow or sell you one used.

Then some fuses are probably blown, You see the first thing i did after i thought i had updated the vesc with the right firmware was to plug it in and try to start it. I think i am just going to sell it to someone who has the experience and then just buy a new one.

oh the fuses aren't on the vesc they are there to protect your battery usually in a black container made of plastic attached to the red or black wire.

Donâ€™t give up so fastðŸ˜œ
I donâ€™t think that you have a serious hardware problem.
Just get a st-link and load the right firmware.
A st-link is way much cheaper than to buy a new vesc

Never made. But theoretically no. Just hook up the right wires to your vesc, plug in the st link to your usb and flash your vesc via the vesc tool.
If you search here in the forum, you should find some information.
Or just ask in a new thread.
There are a lot of people who already made it.

By the way, just ordered one for me to have one in case iâ€˜ll need one dayðŸ˜…

When you get it, youâ€™ll want to download the software from the st link website and then flash your VESC with the FW provided by the VESC tool.

Hello:
I never heard of that message before when flashing the bootloader with a STLink, all I can see is that you wrote the incorrect firmware you should have written 4.12v instead of 48.

This has happened to me by mistake in the past and what you need to do is write the bootloader and firmware following the steps described the aforementioned post, check your VESC connections to STLink again and follow the steps slowly. 

If you already have done that I strongly suggest you get a focbox, install it and move forward, don't try to keep fixing the old one or you might get frustrated and leave the hobby forever, never experimenting such a rewarding feeling that is riding an electric sk8, just because a small piece of hardware failing on you. 

Btw, if you ever repair the tb vesc you should never use it in Foc, I saw you were measuring L&R, stick to BLDC and you will have a working board for years.
