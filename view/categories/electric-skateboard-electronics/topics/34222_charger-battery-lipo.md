They are both capable of charging your battery pack faster than it really should be, since you shouldn't charge lipo batteries any faster than 1C. Go with whichever one has better reviews or is cheaper.

I have a B6 and I like it. Never used an accucell 6, but I imagine they're similar in terms of usage.

The turning 80w is great. I'd get that since it's higher  watts and you can charge faster or at least closer to 1c :)

I mainly use my 250w charger now and ended up buying a cheap 30amp 12v psu for it so I could charge at 10amps if I wanted to. I use to just use a small 7amp  brick psu.

I would recommend getting the genuine IMAX B6 I have a fake one and it doesn't even show the correct voltages. It does charge fine but it gets quite hot since it's only a 50w charger and charging at 5 amps and 22.2v is about 125watts
