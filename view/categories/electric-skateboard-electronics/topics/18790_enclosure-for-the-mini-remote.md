Has anyone got a STL file to print a 3D enclosure to change my mini remote?

There are enclusures designs for the GT2B but not for the Mini AFAIK

Doesn't seem worth it as its pretty small already. I think u can take the wheel off if u want.

i take off the wheel since day one. but i still feel abit big to put pocket. 
anyone have mini remote design? 
last time i saw a banana design for mini remote, but not sure can work or not.

We need to make some kind of badwolf design maybe @jackw can do something. Later we could add a Bluetooth screen and arduino to check speed, current, Watt meter and check balancing of packs. 

For now I could be happy with just the enclosure.

If someone can send me very precise dimensions of the internals, Ill see what I can come up with.

EDIT:  I need exact dimensions to build the model in solidworks.  Better yet, if someone has one to load I could model and then print to test the actual fitment.

@Eboosted heh finally someone digging this up..

I also had thought about modifying it at least a little bit.. battery compartment could be a lot smaller since 2xAA batteries are a bit big.. also.. the trigger play can be extended.. if another enclosure is made.. since the original case has a bit of limitation.. and not allows the trigger to go all the way up or down..

i still havent tried it but I read the wheel can be used as the control instead of the trigger if you hook up the wires to the other channel.
I enjoy leaving the wheel so when I let people ride my board I can explain how the wheel is used to turn:smiling_imp:   then I wait to see what they say

I have a few versions that fit..but still needs the small details.....

the pcb is small, but the pots end up making it pretty thick. and they need mods and extra hardware so i just left them a while ago and moved on to arduino remotes for more features!

```
You need a dual drive so that you can connect the steering channel to the slave VESC. And then you need my firmware mod where you can enable the secondary channel as cruise control signal. You can read more about it in my thread.
I also modified the cruise control especially for dual drive so that I calculate the speed by the rpm signal of 2 motors. This makes it smoother during carving. So I control each motor individually based on the actual situation. That also works for 4wd.

I also have ideas how I can get it running for single drive. But not sure that it will work. And with dual drive you get the better signal when you carve.

Here is a video of the Cruise Control with the mini remote in action

Ben, I'm also planning to use the wheel as light switch

I purchased a switch from HK, it activates if wheel is turned more than 50%, however I also need an UBEC to lower the voltage of the 10S4P battery down to 5v and modify the Shred Lights to make them work with the e-Board battery instead of their own. 

Pretty cool mod in my opinion, any ideas to improve it?

i am using this control for light, but seem not really working. 
this circuit is for drone. 

what i guess is:
this circuit need an on off signal rather then continues signal. Wheel consider continues signal which they control the servo. 
So on this situation wheel signal not really can communicate to this circuit.

That seems to be too complicated.

Here is the switch I bought:

We could use the steering wheel control on the mini remote to turn on/off the lights, I only need the UBEC to do this

If using that receiver controlled switch with the wheel, since the wheel always spins back to its original position wouldn't the lights only be on when you held the wheel in the on position?

This is the min-remote mod I've been working on (a few mins here and there).  My concept is to make this mod use no more than the parts available in the remote already, use trigger or thumb for throttle and be easy to assemble.  By moving the wheel to the top the user is allowed to choose trigger or wheel for throttle & brake based on the channel connection at the RX.  You will notice the trigger is not present, don't worry it is coming.

That's great man!, but to be honest and, as this is design time, it looks similar than the one we got. If you still can modify it and you are open for suggestions, don't use a 90 degree angle, use something like 120, give the bottom a pointed shape and the front a more rounded end.
```

I'm always open to suggestions.  I can do the angle change.  The entire bottom is for batteries, so all of the components fit in the top section.  The trick is to make everything fit snug but not tight, so the rounded front end will be difficult unless I make it longer.

If you wish to keep the AA battery holder, would be cool to integrate some option for folks who later use it, to add led meter or something, to monitor the state of AA cells..

Or, I dont know, at least a place for port, if someone wishes to use battery charger for AA batteries.

This could be a simple cutout near the battery compartment, with a space available to install ''arduino'' header for checking the voltage, for example.

Though this is purely optional and im just laying out my thoughts on how I would do it lol, if I had to design it..

At this point there are apparently a few people working on this, so I'm not going for a ton of features until I get a working model printed.  If you can get me the measurements for the cutouts and locations, Ill be glad to include them.

All I am really trying to do right now is make both the trigger and thumb wheel pots centered so you can choose either one for throttle and cruise control/lights.  I prefer the thumb trigger of remotes like the Benchweel and Nano-X but I know a lot of people prefer triggers, this gives us the best of both worlds.  

I am planning on printing the battery compartment as a separate piece so users can either use it or not, some will be replacing it with small lipo or li-ion batteries.  If the double AA's last for 6 months, I say why fix it if it ain't broke.

Some of the ones which I used, lasted maybe for 1-2months.. before some dropouts started to happen but then again I didnt really focus on whenever these were high capacity AA's or not.. as I just threw in some which seemed to be a bit better than the rest..

I personally don't know, just what I've read here.  I only got a mini-remote yesterday, haven't even used it yet.  I would just like to see a mod that didn't require a user to go out and buy 50 buck worth of stuff, the @MasterCho GT2B mod did this and was hugely popular.  

After I get a working prototype I will likely branch the design to include features that other people want.

Yeh, for now just continue on with the design and implementation of the existing stuff and after that ther can be some versions with ''extra features'' etc..

I just wont want it to be buried under piles of text etc, when u maybe progress further and some people  would want to ''expand'' the capability of the remote and they would either have to redesign it a bit or use hand tools like dremel / drill to cut holes etc.

Here are z precise measurements for the mainboard that was in my mini controller. 

To make the board smaller you can take off the trimmer potentiometers and juste bridge the terminals. 
I am testing how long it can run on a single 800mah cell and it is looking good. 

Maximum thickness of the board is 16mm.

I finally learned how to use Fusion 360 and decided I'd try and make one as well.
I'm modeling it after the BadWolf mod for the GT2B. I kinda liked it and it looked easy. Plus I didn't want to tear apart my GT2B cause I use it for my RC cars.

Anyways, here is what I have so far. This is just day one of prototyping so it's not finished. Only have one side done.

I'm also converting it to lithium power, though I don't know if the 4.2v - >=3.3v will make the transmitter burn and I don't want to use a regulator.
The two AA batteries make up 3v, so would the lithium battery do any harm?

Hmm interesting. The remote is running off ~2 - 3v. I tried making a voltage divider, but it just oscillates on and off. Also tried a tiny buck converted, but it wouldn't turn on. I'm afraid to run anything above 3v.

Anyone done any progress on this? @jackw @mmaner @saul @okp 

I just received 3 mini remotes and some 1s 800mah lipos and I have one of the remotes disassembled in front of me.
Currently watching a bit of Fusion360 tutorials and playing around, but 3D-modelling isn't really my forte to say the least.

I do have one full spool of PLA filament that I'm more than willing to use to do some test prints with if you have something close to completed.

I actually found one person who would be very interested to get a reliable / working mini remote but with thumb wheel.. just like your 3d model.

I know you released 3d files somewhere.. is the 3d model also buried there?

[/quote]

yeh, it sounds problematic.

@will_manners proposed 14500 sized li-ion, but yes, he would still need 2 of them, but the direction is a bit good, since there are smaller format li-ions available, they just cost more and could be easly stacked to make 2S config.

If it is for arduino, then I think he can go up till 12v, since regulator does the rest. So there shouldnt be problems with 8.4v for that matter.

You should theoretically be able to use any size, combination or chemistry as long as it falls within the voltage range for the remote it should be fine. (Note: it goes without saying that I'm assuming if someone is using multiple batteries that the chemistry and capacity are identical for each cell).

Only issue I can think of is that now you have a different end-voltage when the battery is completely discharged but the remote won't account for the different chemistry and will continually discharge a Li-ion, it might be best to use a protected Li-ion cell.

Yes, I have found the cutoff voltage on the Mini Remote to be somewhat in the 2V range, a 14500 cell has 3.7V nominal voltage, this cell would be continuosly discharged down to 2V, so the cell would be screwed after the first full use.

Somebody said a couple of months ago that the components on the mini remote can only handle 3.6V. Fully charged ASAP batterys have a voltage of 1.8V. So 3.6V in total. A 14500 is also a normal li-ion battery and fully charged the will have 4.2V. But maybe the components can handle more. I never tried. Just let me know if it works.

yep, this was the thing I was concerned about! It is not as easy as swap one li-ion battery to another one, like it is with GT2B..

Afterall, someone designed the circuit for taking int 2X AA batteries, not 3.7-4.2v of voltage.

But we will see, hopefully :)

This is the main reason I've moved away from the mini remote mods. 
The mcu is made for 3.3v which means 3.6v is ok, but 4.2? not sure. I didn't try because I'd rather not burn out a remote.

Instead I used an [mcp1700](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/MCP1700-3302E-TO/MCP1700-3302E-TO-ND/652680) to get 3.3v, it has input upto 6v and ldo so it works great on a single li ion.

alternative is to use a 3v trinket, the internal buck can give upto 150ma, and you can use the attiny85 and a few ws2812 leds for a battery meter.
then you also need a liion charger.

the added parts make the mini remote a pain to mod. and not very compact anymore either...which was its main thing...

Charges 1s lithium ion from USB, output 100ma adjustable voltage 1.2v - 4.2v

Gonna see if ebay or ali has a prebuilt board based on this chip. Them maybe Instamorph for the enclosure.

MM so close, but this is boost, we need buck

Same internals, new case, and I make use of an arduino + BT module along with a oled display so you can view board battery, controller battery, speed, and total distance. Hope to have a prototype in the next week or so working while I wait for motor parts. Will be a fun project :)

I took off the wheel and dremeled off the nub. Then slapped on a NFC tag on it to cover the hole. That NFC tag is programmed to open up my gps tracker. Became useless when I went back to an iPhone though.

I'll look into this. I'm usually pretty vocal on here on the latest of what I'm working on, so you'll see it I'm sure before I'm finished.

Are you sure It's correct? You have one thicknes? You turned the electronics so you won't have access to trim knobs....

As long as I set the trim before assembly and shipment, then the knobs are more of a novelty. I havenâ€™t touched them in years with no problems.

Some of my cuts need to be made bigger. Didnâ€™t factor in shrinkage to this degree. But Iâ€™ll keep going. The trigger fits well, as the screw holes are good. Itâ€™ll take a few prints to get it right but itâ€™s not as bad as I thought it would be.

What material you use for prints? In my version knobs are also hiden but the placment of them is very close to wall so if there is a need I can add holes or you can drill them.

I'm finding good luck with printing so far. I did my v2 print today, battery fits perfectly, bms fits perfectly. Still have some work to do on the hole for the screen. I've messed with hips and abs, and abs so far is what I'm printing with. I don't think they are needed, as long as they are calibrated in the beginning.

I would have kept my mini remote if there was a solution or a thumb wheel conversion.

there is the thumb wheel if you connect it to the other signal.

Any news on this? Your print look awesome! Could you share stl files ? I am full of my "big" mini remote and I recently got a 3d printer and would love to make it smaller :D Thank you! @LukePL
