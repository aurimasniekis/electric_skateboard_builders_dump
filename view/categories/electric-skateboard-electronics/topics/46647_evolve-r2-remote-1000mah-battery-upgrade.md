The new R2 remote for Evolve electric skateboards comes with a pathetic 500mah lithium battery. The previous remote's battery was 750mah! Why Evolve? Why!?
This means that it barely lasts over three hours! That's less time than you should get out of a stock Evolve board battery pack, let alone one with one of my upgraded batteries in. Evolve claims it lasts 4 hours... It doesn't.
With this upgrade, in theory it should last over 6 hours! Plenty of time for a decent ride...

Does this PCB look the same as new enertion prototype? I saw picture somewhere....https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3664eecb634a4fca59ae02124561c180/5B16C399/t51.2885-15/e35/27577325_125658248164389_4150123350758260736_n.jpg

It's not my remote...

I tried it, but having the brake in your thumb when you're accelerating I find so unintuitive :confused:
