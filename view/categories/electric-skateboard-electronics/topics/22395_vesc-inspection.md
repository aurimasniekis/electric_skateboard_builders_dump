Hi,

i am now at the point where i could start the motor detection with my vesc. but the more i read in this forum about failures the more i got scared. So as @chaka mentioned in the vesc-faq ([this thread](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-faq-when-to-use-low-voltage-vesc-configuration/1965)) i tried to inspect the vesc meticulously. But thats hard without completely understanding the whole board or the connections. 
So i thought itÂ´s maybe a good thing for every novice to post pictures of their vesc if they find something questionable. A trained eye will see weak points immediately and hopefully can help out before frying the valuable controller.

All looks good to me! But if it hasn't been tested before you got it I would test it on a laptop power supply or a lab supply if you have one. This way if there is a short it wouldn't be enough amps to fry anything.

Not sure if applicable in the ESK8 VESC application, but I have a smoke stopper that I use on all new drone builds to stop from burning anything up from a short when I first apply lipo power (4s in those scenarios). I'm posting a pic and a link below in case anyone is interested in making one.

You can use 2 x 9V batteries in series to power the VESC the first time.
