I purchased a VESC late last year from DIY. It worked for about 2 months and then the DRV 8302 chip stopped working. I got a friend to remove it with a hot air gun, but it appears that there is some solder or something left on the VESC which we couldn't exactly remove. I have a new DRV chip to install but it doesn't look like I can simply install it without fixing the area it goes on. Images:

I am looking for someone who can repair this for me. I am in NYC and I'm willing to ship it anywhere (ideally in America).
