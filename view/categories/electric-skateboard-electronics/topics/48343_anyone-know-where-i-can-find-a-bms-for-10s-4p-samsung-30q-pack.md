Anyone know where I can find a BMS for 10s 4p Samsung 30Q pack? I looked around all morning and couldn't find much. Are there any USA options?

First there's no such thing as bms for 10s4p pack it's just the amount of series so 10s and it doesn't matter the brand battery ect as long it's 10s or cells in series that's all that counts.  
Bms's  in the USA are rare and hard to come buy u can buy them from China but takes time the only guy who I think has bms in USA is @thisguyhere

well...the number P groups does have something to do with the discharge amps rating.

For a welded Li-ion pack I would highly recommend that you get a high amp discharge bms and connect it normally, not bypassing for discharge.
You can get a Bestech with a built in antispark E-switch so that you won't have to add an external E-swicth or loop key to turn the board on and off.
The Bestech HCX-D223V1 can handle 80a continuous and up to 240a peak which is plenty for discharge.
The built in E-switch doubles as a reset switch to recover the bms from protection mode, so you won't have to open the enclosure and disconnect the battery to reset like other bms's.

You can order them by 2's directly from Bestech or someone on the forum might have an extra they would be willing to sell.

it's less than 10a charging current.

this is a super common bms, literally the first result when googling "10s bms"

Most commonly used on the forum are samsung 30q. Samsung 25r. And some have used lg hg2. Sony's vtc. Or lipos. As for those MXJOs I heard they can be just rewrapped batteries like Sanyo or Panasonic. I wouldn't mess with those unless you can physically test them yourself

Wait are you guys sayin I can use the cheaper BMS if I bypass discharging through the BMS? Or should I just get 2 of the nice BMS's from bestech? Since I have 10s 4P with cells that do 15a doesn't that mean my discharge current is 60a? Thanks!

A BMS has a lot of features but most of us only use it to balance charge not to discharge . so if u buy a cheap small 10s 15amps discharge BMS it wouldn't matter because your bypassing the bms . there is alot of benifts to having a BMS not bypassed tho such as it shuts off the cells if they get to low most of us rely on the vesc to do that .
I prefer bypassed because once u go big I don't think there is a 120amp BMS that is not crazy big that will fit in your board .

Okay so if I buy this BMS: DC42-45V Input Battery Protection BMS PCB Board for 10 Packs 36V Li-ion Cell Max 40A w/ Balance https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074WZL5NF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_mEbOAb078WQ0Q

What charger do I need? Would it work since it's only rated for 40a?

Your still not understanding , if u want to get a small BMS like that what u will have to do is not use it for discharge because its only 40a con but to only strictly use it to charge. That's what BMS bypassed means. Now if u wanted to get a BMs with let's say 80a then it would he big and bulky its preference.
As for charger y'all need a 10s charger 36v

Okay I understand that, but what about input current limit? Also the cells charge to 42v so wouldn't the charger need to be 42v not 36v?

36V Electric Bike battery charger Output 42V 2A Charger Input 100-240 VAC Lithium Li-ion Li-poly Charger For 10Series Tangspower https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074SJT6ZT/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_4NbOAbZGTJEBP

This would work if I got the right charging port.

get a charger specific to your pack.  so...seems you're building a 10s pack, so get a charging brick or power supply that's made for a 10s pack.  and yes, in voltage it will be 42v (4.2v per cell x 10).

if i was building an 8s pack, you would get a power supply that delivers 33.6v (4.2 x 8).

for example, i run 12s and use this charging brick:

Just to wrap things up and make sure I dont blow anything up, please give me a sanity check on this:

I can use the lower amperage rated BMS if I bypass the discharge part of the BMS and use a loop key, and I also need to get a 42V charger and matching charge port to charge the BMS which charges and balances my cells? is there an input amp limit i should keep in mind when selecting a charger? would a 2amp 42V charger be good or do I need more amps to charge faster?

[/quote]

yes, these cheap bms should be bypassed.  use loop key (using antispark xt90s) as main power switch.  best thing would be source a high discharge current bms so you can let the bms handle both charging and discharging.  however, many of us use these small bms and bypass dischage.

correct, 42v charger for your 10s pack.  you can use whatever charging port you'd like since you can solder them on.  just make sure your polarities match.

[/quote]

2a charge current for a 12ah pack will take a while, 4a would be faster obviously.  i use a 1.5a charger to charge my 12s4p pack, it takes HOURS, but i just leave it plugged in over night.

generally speaking liion cells should be charged at or under 1c.  meaning, if it's a 3ah cell, max charging current for that one cell should be 3a.  but you're building a 4p pack, which means your capacity will be 12ah, meaning 1c charge current can be as high as 12a.  almost no one has a charger that can output at this rate.

Looks alright. Although that diagram isn't complete. There should be a switch between vesc and battery. The main positive wire of the vesc should be directly connected to the battery. Only negative wires connect to the bms (excluding balance wires).
