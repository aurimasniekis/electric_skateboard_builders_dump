I have an  R-SPEC MOTOR and it seems to not function properly.  Originally it was very twitchy as seen in the video below.  I have no disasembled my board and now the motor in question seems to work properly most the time using the blcd tool.  However, when I turn it a little bit, the motor will shoot a spark and stop.  Any idea if the motor is salvageable?  it is an older model moto.  I had read a post from onloop that said there could be extra coil in the motor that I could heat shrink.
