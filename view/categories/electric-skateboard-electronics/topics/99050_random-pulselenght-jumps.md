Hey, I'm having some problems with my Flipsky vx1 remote. When I connect it with the UART port to the vesc it works fine, however, when I try to connect it with PPM it flips out. The pulslength jumps from 1.1500 to 1.5000 randomly which makes it hard to mapp. Would love some help

Hi,

Try to add a ferrite ring. It helps sometimes with this kind of behaviour.
