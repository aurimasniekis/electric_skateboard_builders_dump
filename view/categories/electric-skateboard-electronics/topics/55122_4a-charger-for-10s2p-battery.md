I got my battery from a guy on this forum, who offered to include a 4a fast charger with it for an extra $60, which I declined because I didn’t have the money. Now I do, and he’s not answering, so I was wondering if someone could help me find one. The dc jack for the battery is a 5.5x2.5mm, (same one that Meepoboard uses). It needs to have a US plug. My battery is 6000mah if that matters.

You "probably" need abit of soldering work to fit your plug.

As I remember default Meepo is 10s2p, so this charger does fit.

Is there any kind of adaptor I could use instead?
