Sadly, it needs to be rewound. There are a lot of guides online, plus side is you can alter the kv/improve efficiency if done well.

Wow ... Need more info bro...there is some reason it heating up... I'd re-check phase wires...make sure the tips of the bullet connectors aren't touching ... Hand spin the motor.... Is it smooth? Or is something grinding or giving it resistance....

I can't even take off the housing because the Allen key holes are stripped. I received the motor like that :confused:

The motor is smooth, only resistance I get it the belt tensions. It could be the wires because I took off the originals and replaced them for less stiff wires. Though everything it wrapped in heatshrink/electric tape.

Were you going up a hill? I find that without a VESC, my board doesn't limit the amount of amps going into the motor, which is a problem up hills because there's more load and obviously too much power can blow your motor. If you have a VESC, try limiting the amount of max power to the motor.

I went on a 4 mile ride, some hills:

The motor would stutter going up hills so I walked them.

The stuttering is some type of short...if the phase wires intermittently touch you can get the jerking motor...also signs of a burned out motor

This whole statement is confusing...How the heck did the motor come with stripped bolts?????

There is another thread going on now that addresses the reason motors and Esc's burn up.
I plan on doing some testing myself on the 3 phase side of the Esc and will post my findings later today.

drill the heads off the screws and pull the can off then remove the screws with plyers

I'll probably do that. Or maybe make a slot with a dremel for a flathead screwdriver.

Smart!  Aren't most of these motors just held together with a circlip like this one from enertion?

I have that motor.  If u can get it off the mount its rotor is held connected with just a c clip like all of them. The pic above. On the shaft closest to the center

I tore my c clip off a long time ago because it was making an annoying noise

Then you can just pull the rotor off.  i stripped those screws as well and had to use a dremel to make no slots too.  But u don't have to do that to take it apart.  It's the same with all these outrunner

You can save the motor, but you have to rewind it, like i said. Here's a instructables guide. You might have to hit up a rc forum to get more detailed help, as this is commonly done to upgrade/fix old motors. 
I count 12 poles, how many magnets does it have? (the part the you numbered in the picture) If it's 14 you can follow this guide below exactly.

http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Wind-a-12N-14P-Brushless-Outrunner/

If you find it to be too much for you, reassemble the motor and sell it, rcgroups has a classifed section and someone will buy it off you most likely if you are unwilling to undertake the rewiring.
