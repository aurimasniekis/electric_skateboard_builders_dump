So I have this 10s2p pack in my [budget build](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-budget-campus-cruiser-dual-flipsky-4-20-10s2p-samsung-20r/73312). But I just destroyed it by over-discharging to a useless voltage level. So without spending too much, should I buy some lipo and enjoy that high discharge rate or just try to find some 18650 pack or make one myself? Is lipo really cheaper? I want something that can fit in this Ownboard enclosure.

Turnigy graphene lipo packs are the highest known form of lipos at the moment. There are accounts of people discharging them as low as 1.6v/c with full recovery!! Sure, they're expensive for lipos, but they are unparalleled in performance and durability. As far as fitment, I can't answer the question, but they are good for 1000+ charge cycles. That is also unparalleled.

Also, liion are far more expensive, especially if you factor in the cost of nickel strips, fish paper, all the other shit you gotta buy to make them "safe", and a spot welder. Lol, wanna know how I _really_ feel about it? Best bang for the buck/cm3/power to weight/etc. =lipo. Especially the HK graphene packs.

Edit: no idea, but seriously. Hk graphene

I looked into buying HobbyKing Turnigy Heavy Duty packs for a while until my current Graphenes went on sale for 50% and I couldn't pass them up. Heavy Duty ones have good discharge rating, around 60C advertised on the soft packs. I don't have any experience with them, they just looked like a good alternative to Graphenes.
Also check out @Namasaki thread on 10S LiPo with BMS. Tons of good info on there.

Yup picked up HK graphenes for $27 a pop. I'm using a 10s setup right now with no issues at all. they are rated for 90c discharge, I don't know how true that is I'm waiting on the metr update to get data. But tons of power.

HK Graphenes are the closest to their stated C-rate out of all lipos. Here's the proof: 
https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?1767093-Battery-Load-Test-Comparisons

To answer your question @mtuan293 , ALL lipos are below graphenes!!

Edit: I _do_ realize that a 3c multistar is closer to its "10c" label, than a true55c HKG is to "75c", but you're missing the point if that's what you're concerned with

In a case that small, I'd probably go lipo just for the extra discharge capability. In my opinion, the advantages of li-ion really shine in either (A) large packs, where longevity is a must and extreme power density is not needed, or (B) in small to medium packs where you want the most energy density, but don't mind taking a hit to power density. 

For small packs where you want ALL the power, lipo is king. It won't last as many cycles or hold as much energy per kg, but it's cheaper and higher discharge.

For a high power build (anything bigger than a single 6355 or thereabouts) you really need either lipos, or at least 3-4p of li-ion to handle the required current.

I guess it's because of that "safety". People tend to afraid lipo pouch can be easily damaged causing fire and all the stuff compared to metal housing of liion 18650 cells. But I feel like using cylindrical cells there's lots of space wasted compared to squared shaped of lipos

True, there is a lot of space wasted. But going by the rated capacity and dimensions of a 2.2ah 4s turnigy graphene, it has a volumetric energy density of just a hair over 200wh/l. A single flat layer of 18650-30Q cells (Including the air space!) has a volumetric energy density of 514 wh/l. Bare cells are 633 wh/l.

I thought cylindrical lion cells are less space efficient than squared lipo cells. i.e., you can fit more chemistry into the corners of the square which would have been lost due to the circular shape of lion cells. Looking at your 18650 pack there's always gap between cells, now imagine you make a battery pack with square corners it would utilize all the gap and give you some extra capacity/discharge.

See above. It's true that there is less room for battery chemicals. But, the battery chemistry is SO much better, that it still way outperforms RC pouch cells in terms of energy/l or energy/kg. 

lipos still win in terms of watts/l and watts/kg though.

Lipo have a nice discharge curve too staying high before finally out of juice.   That’s worth something.  And probably can charge them much faster without damaging.

Because the construction of the layers inside is a jelly-roll. Try and make a square cinnamon roll, and you'll see why. 

Another reason is that the layers tend to try and puff up, expanding away from each other during high discharge, etc. The cylindrical shell applies even pressure from all sides and has no tendency to buckle in one direction or another. This is why large packs of prismatic li-ion cells always have some sort of structure to keep the cells compressed. Cylindrical cells have that built in already. 

If you made square cans, the flat sides would bulge out due to the forces applied to them simply from the assembly process, much less from the layers trying to puff over time.

You can compress lipo. Think it’s good for them.

I think lipo are safer given the track record here.  So many cells and possible points of failure with ion vs plugs and fewer cells.  Just scratching off the insulation on ion can be disaster

Yep. But we don't usually because it's a pain and takes extra space/weight/engineering to do it. 

Buy round li-ion, and they're pre-compressed.

Pouch lipos are in cell phones, tablets and etc. As far as large scale industrial manufacturing goes, companies like the one that makes iPhone batteries have the machines capable of consistent production. This guy, whom I believe is with revoelectric, has some interesting things to say about it: 
https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=29238904&postcount=1774

This is linked in the main article _I_ linked a few posts up.
Tldr, it seems that industry is tooled for liion and small capacity lipo manufacturing, but not really for large capacity lipo manufacturing. And as the graphene lipos are fairly new among lipos, commercial adoption may be limited to hobby batteries for a while. 

My thoughts anyway, but what do I know. Pretty much thinking "out loud"

The shape of that box, I don't think you can get interesting lipos in there.

Plus, the diyelectric esc most likely has voltage cutoffs for lithium ion, not lipo.

Plus, if you do the same thing to the lipos that you did to the 10s2p pack, :fire:

The cheapest decent lipos are usually the 30c or 40c hobbyking, zippy or turnigy. Usually 3s or 4s for the shape (makes 10s difficult).

You can hit 10s with 2s or 5s lipos (usually), both of which will be difficult to fit I think.

Yo, I have the exact same enclosure with 2 4S 4500Mah Zippy Lipo, looking for an upgrade actually because 4.5Ah with 8S is pretty poor, I have an actual 12Km range and a 30km/h top speed.
Mounting a bms need some knowledges, I could do it again if I change for 10S or 12S but i’ll Need some time so it’ll be better to have one bms included battery !

However this is how it look like with my 2 4S +Bms 
![image|666x500](upload://tmLaUPMJwpP7SqhZbdJjVYRbKlA.jpeg) 

Mounting a Sanyo 10S 8.1Ah looks like to be an interesting idea, 27Km range estimated with a higher top speed (10S..) but the max amp is way lower than with my 45C pack from where I can suck 50A easily, there i’ll Need to go for only 30A and I don’t really know what will happen.

However it could be a noice choice because Bms is integrated and they are made to fit our ownboard/meepo enclosure !

Keep me updated tho !

I think the majority of battery failure we have been seeing lately is improper construction or something wearing down. The safety of the battery at that point really isn't the issue.

Both batteries have their pros and cons. I think as far as safety goes, its going to be a personal preference. I feel safer with a well built Lion battery over lipo. I'm personally had lipos from cars and quad puff up and catch fire within a few minutes of pushing them too hard. 

But some people have the same horror story with lion batteries! So that's why I say its going to opinion and application that will help with the decision!

Yea I think the danger w ion is largely the battery pack construction: people are spot welding for the first time then throwing it in one of the most abusive environments.   Ion battery packs often have sharp nickel strip n the thinnest insulationand the possitive terminal is like a mm from the negative under that thin wrap.   It seems the chemistry isn’t as the rest of the variables in my mind and either could go either way

100% agree with you.

I'm working on my first battery pack ever and I'm keeping an eye out for any spot that could be a potential downfall. I'm rounding out all corners, insulating with fish tape, using kapton tape, doing cell level fusing.

I feel more confident with my work so far than a store bought pack from HK. (Unless its a graphene pack, those things are amazing)

This is the point I was talking about. In tight area like mobile devices they can't use a cylindrical shape, therefore square-shaped battery can get the most out of energy/volume ratio. Laptops used to carry the big bulky removable 18650 pack, now with laptop being thinner and lighter, most have square lipo/lion pouch in them. I'm wondering if there's any variant of lion exists that has metal housing like 18650 but rather in square shape.

Lipo have more discharge (burst), less cycle and less range (cut off at 3.3V++ to be long lasting). Li Ion in comparison is slightly heavier, but more durable. It last longer since cut off is set around 3V some can go as low as 2.9V or 2.8V. I have so much good experience with Li Ion compared to Lipo, but I have never tried BMS + Lipo.

I think the Turnigy 40-50c are the sweet spot for price and usable-ness. But it's near the bottom of the barrel. Of course things get better if you add $$$. Graphenes may seem expensive but if you take reasonable care of them, they're much cheaper in the long run.

I'd like to also interject that phone lipo batteries use the same chemistry as 18650s (or very close, there may be slight differences.) This means that if you compare a phone lipo cell and a RC lipo cell, the phone lipo will blow the RC lipo away in terms of energy density. 

Not all lipo cells are created equal. All RC lipos are made for pretty much one thing: **power** density. 
Phone lipos, and the ones in laptops, and 18650s, are made for a different thing: **energy** density.

Yep. The main difference between RC lipos and non-RC stuff (lipo or cylindrical) is the exact composition of the electrodes. To my knowledge, RC lipos are still using Li-cobalt-oxide for the anode, and graphite for the cathode. Non-RC cells use a range of different materials, containing one or more of the following: manganese, nickel, cobalt, and aluminum, for example lithium-nickel-cobalt-aluminum-oxide. This, along with different construction (RC lipos are built for maximum amps, not maximum capacity, and as a result have thicker, less dense electrodes, etc) is where the real advantage of capacity comes from.

Regularly Turnigy are decent if you take good care of them. It really seems like you're going to end up with a big mess and possibly a burnt down house though. Please be careful and research a lot more.

I think you’ll be fine with any. Reviews on the zippy flightmax are pretty good as well from my looking.  Lately thinking the safest thing, maybe even better than checking voltages before charging is feeling the cell’s temp as you’re charging. If not getting hot...it isn’t getting hot...and without heat no fire.

I dont like horror movies.  They’re so formulaic and I ruin it for everyone telling what’s gunna happen.  Or they startle me and that pisses me of.
I’m in a cultural bubble.

These are alot better though. Super campy but they are cult classics and aren't in the typical stream of most horror movies.

They have humour, horror, drama, and everything else....including a chainsaw arm and a boom stick!

Hummies been to busy to see bruce campbell and his adventures with the necronomicon.... but you should definitely check it out with either some brews in your system or some California  legal greenery being sparked. Movies are wild

these were on sale during black friday https://hobbyking.com/en_us/graphene-5600mah-2s2p-hardcase-w-5mm-female-bullet-connector.html

as the price stands right now, i would not recommend these. Just go with a li-ion pack at that price point.

I kept the rwo 5s graphenes and put them in series.  Just got my imax balance charger so im balance charging them for the first time... Should i balance charge them every time i have to charge them?

You don't absolutely have to, but it can't hurt, and if you forget to balance for a long time that can hurt. I'd recommend just getting in the habit of always balance charging to avoid problems caused by a brain-fart.
