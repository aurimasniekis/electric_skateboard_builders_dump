```
hopefully someone here can help me,
new build and first try getting it all running
winning mini controller
12s V-Good ESC
Flipsky 6374  motor

I cant get the motor to turn on, doesnt seem to be pairing with the TX. I run the bind procedure and the red light does what its supposed to on the controller but not on the reciever, the light just goes out when it should be pairing. 
checked voltage at BEC and its 2v, should be 5-6V right??
Any ideas why this could be? Im wondering if its a shotty ESC?
How can i tell is ESC is turned on?
