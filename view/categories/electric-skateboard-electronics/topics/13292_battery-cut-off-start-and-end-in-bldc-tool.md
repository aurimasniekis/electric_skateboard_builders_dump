You should use the forum search function, this has been discussed a million times.
3.5v * S and 3.3v * S

I use 3.3v with 3.0 end. I manage battery life actively, but if i'm in the middle of nowhere and need to get home I don't want my board dying on me when it still has charge. This is for 18650 li-ion cells however. I'd put it a bit higher (like what @chinzw said) if you're running lipos.
