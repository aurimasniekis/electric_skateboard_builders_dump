Hi Everyone.

I am thinking about my new board, and i would like to know how to wire up 2 ESC. I know how to wire them through the direct connection from other threads.

But what capacitors should i use? I guess in theory could just 2x (double size of the ones on a single VESC) But i dont know how many Uf they are

Can someone help me with the uF for a standard VESC and if doubling the uF would work the same way with then only 2 Caps?

I found this great board design for 2 VESC's

I found that each Maytech VESC has 3x 680uF Caps. 

Can i then use 2x 2200uF? like these?

Yes you can do 2x 2200uF in parallel, but aliexpress may not be a good source of components. The caps are under fair bit of stress so maybe go for a more reliable source. But in theory the answer is yes 2200 in parallel will do just fine unless you are doing some crazy long battery wires.

Where exactly?
Uk area farnell
germany area probably TME

EDIT: Farnell is your best bet most probably though, they have a lot of components and shipping is just 4,9â‚¬ or something like that so pretty decent
