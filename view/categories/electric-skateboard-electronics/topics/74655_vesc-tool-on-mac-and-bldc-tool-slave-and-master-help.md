When doing my second build (Dual Motor) I ran into a problem. I'm using two VESC from Torque boards and using the BLDC tool that I downloaded from Enertion's website. For my first build I used the Vesc Tool from the original website, but I can't run it on my Mac. 

1) If anyone knows how to run Vesc Tool on Mac, tell me and that will solve my problems!
2) I can't figure out how to make a master and slave on BLDC tool so that would be helpful! I would rather someone help me with the first one though.
