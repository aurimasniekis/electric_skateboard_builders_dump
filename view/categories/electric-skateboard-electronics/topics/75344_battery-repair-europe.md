Thanks for the mention @Andy87

Can you post some pics, if its only broken, you could just bridge it with a piece of wire until you get a working spot welder

Hey all,
I'm trying to find a part and I can't seem to nail one down. It's a Koowheel board and the part I'm looking for is the part on the battery that connects to the board. It's the two port connector. My son was messing around with an idea of using his battery while at school to charge his phone. He shorted the positive and the negative and damaged the plug. I've tested the battery itself and it's fine. I just need to replace that plug. Anyone know where I can get parts?
