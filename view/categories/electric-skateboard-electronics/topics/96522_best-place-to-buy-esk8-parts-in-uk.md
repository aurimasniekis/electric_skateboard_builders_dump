I'm wondering where is the best place to buy parts for a DIY build when you're based in the UK.  Dielectricskateboards.com has everything in dollars. Apologies if this is obvious, I'm quite new to this!

I'm planning on electrifying this Leafboard freedom cruiser board which I got discounted having bought the Leafboard plus![MVIMG_20190613_183422|666x500](upload://r8quEklr0Zub9KgIS7WSlr6LXHv.jpeg) 
Ideally I want to build something simple, not crazy high spec just useful range and decent speed.

Any help much appreciated!
