I'm in the process of configuring a dual motor setup over CAN bus.

When running the motor detection for each motor, each spins in the correct direction. However when pulling the trigger on my mini remote (after following @skslingo21's guide [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/y-piece-or-canbus/26461/188)), they spin in opposite directions.

Is it safe to simply swap two phase wires of the motor spinning in the wrong direction? Or should this be avoided because I'm running a dual setup over CAN bus, potentially resulting in VESC damage?

VESC HW is 4.12 and firmware 2.18.

Thanks

With the old firmware your only choice if to swap two phase wires indeed.
