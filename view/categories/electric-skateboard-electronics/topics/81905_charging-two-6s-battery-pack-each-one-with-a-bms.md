Hi Everyone!

I want to use two twins 6s Batteries (both with a BMS) in parallel to get more range, so my questions about this are:

*It this posible?, can i use one charger to charge both batteries in parallel at same time?
*Wich kind of BMS are better for this? with separate or common charging/dischaging port?
*If i want to use regen braking it's better to use a separate charging/dischaging port?


What do you think?

Thanks in advance for your answer :D

yes you can use one charger. you can use a hobby charger with a parallel board

a good bms is a 6s bms

you don't need any separate ports for Regen
