So I was just browsing online looking for a 10s3p battery pack we could use for esk8 and I stumbled upon this:
https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/LG-2600mah-battery-cell-10S3P-36V_60566118892.html?spm=a2700.7724857.main07.81.749de7dfdKf75N

Could we use this for our boards?

Yep, as long as you get them to change the BMS to a higher rated one, which from their description they can do.

I guess they skimp on the nickel strip, one layer most likely isnt going to cut it for esk8. I would go minimun 40-45A, but hey if you are a slow rider 30A may be ok.
