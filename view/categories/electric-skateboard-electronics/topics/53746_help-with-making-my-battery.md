Ok, long story short is I haven't got a clue about how many cells and how much money I should invest in my battery pack...I've only recently started to look into making my own e-board but I'm already stuck on the battery.
I want to make a board that is able to go around 7 miles...in short I want it to be a bit better than a boosted board but have only one motor.
I've already decided to go with the LG/HG2 batteries(10 of them) since they are 3000mAh and are high current discharge batteries at 20A continuous. Now I have a couple of questions...
1st:Whats the best configuration of these 10s,5s2p...?
2nd:Whats the best BMS for this configuration?
3rd:How much range would this give me?
Thanks!

I would go at least 3p so you have 9Ah

Thats a 110wh battery you posted (10s1p)
Aasuming you use around 10-15wh per km you would get around 9km

With a 3p you would have around 21km range
