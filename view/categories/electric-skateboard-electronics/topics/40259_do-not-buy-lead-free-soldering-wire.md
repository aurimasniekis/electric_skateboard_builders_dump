This is little tip for everyone, don't buy Lead free soldering wire.
I know it sounds great idea, non toxic  environment friendly and cheaper.
BUT!
 It won't melt, won't stick, will crack, cold solder, and ruins ur components.
I bought cheepo solder wire says 63-37 (63tin/37pb), but it turns out to be lead free.

Honestly I don't see the point. for us hand solderings it is completely useless

 Now I see why some cell phone has dead board and cold solder.

Again stay away from lead free.

I've been using lead-free solder for a long time and I haven't really had that much of an issue with it.  Sometimes it doesn't stick super well, but then I just throw a little flux on it and it is usually fine.  I feel better soldering for a few hours and not breathing little particles of lead, idk, just my opinion.

Good for you that you can manage it. :smile:

  I'm so used to 60/40 that when I tried pb free, I burned my hands, and ruined couple wires. it doesn't even tin the damn wire properly, with flux it worked better. yet it is not as good as 60/40.

I also heard, the long term issue with lead free. tin crystal grows and shorts circuit.

It will be depends on the quality of lead-free wires of course, but generally they suck! I rather turn the noisy fan with lead smoke.

So here's the breakdown, at least in my experience and understanding. Technically it takes a lot of heat for lead to actually burn and produce any fumes, much more heat than a soldering iron can produce, however the fumes from all solder are bad for you and are known to cause asthma, and generally not cancer. Use whatever solder you have a preference with. If you use lead free or any high melt solder, buy some quick alloy to feed into those joints during removal and it will make life easier. Lead free or leaded are both bad to breathe in, so buy a fume extractor for $20 or set a fan up in a well ventilated area. 63-37 is probably the easiest to work with for most people, just because it melts easy and is either solid or liquid with almost no in between.

Oh that sucks lol yeah I have always soldered with lead free so maybe I don't know how easy it can be

My father was an electrical and mechanical engineer. Spent his entire ‚Äúshort‚Äù 55 year life soldering and CAD work. He was diagnosed with lung cancer at 51 and after surgery, chemotherapy and radiology, he died from it spreading to liver and brain. Doctors thinks it stems from the contact andinhalation of lead in solder from the 70‚Äôs - 2000‚Äôs. From what I can remember he‚Äôs always done it at a window or garage with a fan sucking the fumes out. I‚Äôm hesitant about lead solder but they do have better results.

I'm sorry to hear that. It's definitely possible, also solders back then had different chemicals in their flux core than modern ones, so maybe that caused it. Nonetheless, that is a terrible tragedy and I'm sure he was a great man. The last thing I want to say, since this is such a serious issue that's easy to overlook is all of these chemicals can be found in solder fumes:
Chlorophenol 
Formaldehyde
Glutaraldehyde
Benzene
Phenol
Ethanolamine
Hydrochloric acid
Acetaldehyde
Styrene
Toluene
Isopropanol
Acetone

Bottom line is, know what you're doing and never solder without proper ventilation. If you have to wave the fumes out of your face, you've already breathed in the "threshold level" of chemicals for the day. [Here's an article from Weller for those interested](https://www.elexp.com/Images/Health_Hazards.PDF)

There are solid lead-free tin, and flux-filled tin, even flux-filled multi-core tin which is most practical. But 60/40 is still the best for consumer :slight_smile:

60/40 and a fume sucker. IF you can't find one right for your application, you can DIY one pretty easy with a shop vac and some clever woodworking. 

lead free is garbage. Flux fumes are the real killer here in my opinion. pure 60/40 ingut in a solder pot doesn't fume that way.

yea same here...

most of the soldiers on my board are with lead-free matchstick solder üòÇ.  I‚Äôve now upgraded to 60/40 Leaded solder, much easier and quicker solders

also get a decent iron. I hear this all the time: "not everyone can afford a good soldering station, dude."

horse shit. This is the iron i use:

http://www.mpja.com/ZD-929C-Solder-Station/products/460/

480 degrees C, granular tuning down to the fucking degree and its only $50. Not only that, the same store has the tips and the replacement wands all day long for just as cheap. Looks like they're out of stock at the moment but that's no biggie. They'll be back very very soon. I shop there a lot. 

OR you could walk into radio shack and pay $20 for a 15 watt iron (if you can get past all the fucking phones and back into the tiny corner where they still have an iron and maybe a drawer with some LEDs in it) and hate yourself, or go to the hobby shop and pay almost $40 for a 30 watt handheld that doesn't even tell you how hot it is and doesn't get as hot anyway.

Weller makes good stuff, my dad still has his irons from when i was a kid.

Also you have a 100W iron so the most important consideration has been considered. Heat. Some of these crap irons that are marked up are less than 30 watts which is barely usable for anything. I've seen 25 and even 15 watt irons on the shelf for $35 before. ITs retarded. People can get trapped like that.

Good luck but preach on brother. I have been telling people for years, "you need a bigger iron".  Those little pencil tips just don't cut it on fat cables. So many bullet connector out there are barely hanging on, riddled with cold joints.

the horror of dangling bullet connectors! Just get a blow torch, heat the bullet, fill with solder and put the wire in...

yes sir! i fix a lot of that shit in other people's boards. people would be shocked how little solder it actually takes to make a very strong forever lasting weld in a bullet because they forget about flux and heat. The shit has to flow and bond. 

you need a hot fucking iron and the 15845-TL series stations are solid at a rock bottom price for what it delivers. 

I can see myself spending a shitload on a full hot air station one day but for now, i've got three of these things and i love them. And for $50 i mean damn. I seriously want a bad ass reflow station though.

I have three of those rebranded combo units. Two of them live in the bone yard/intern parts haven. I finally broke down and bought individual units. The cheapo hot air units need to be allowed to cool off before turning them off, if you turn the fan off before the element has cooled they tend to fail. Now that I follow that procedure I have not had one burn out on me.

that makes total sense. 

Also i might be making a reflow oven soon. I was looking at that kit you mentioned a not too long ago.

Sorry if this has been said 100 times but you guys have discovered ts100 soldering irons right?

https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F263107820851

that link is just the first one I found on eBay, I don't know if that is a trusted seller or not.

but the soldering irons are amazing, 65 watt, with pid  temp control, filed interface, g sensing.
they can be set to heat up when you shake them and turn off after inactivity.  There are mod firmware. 
they run from a wide range of power sources, I have a lead with clips so I can run it off the car battery, and a lead with connector for my lipol pack.  You can also power them from a usb C power supply through a adapter board.  
Anyway, guessing you have already all.come across them but if not, highly recommended

i have this one (branded as SEEED mini soldering iron) and i have to disagree. It just doesn't get hot enough/have enough power to solder anything large

I have a reflow over, conveyor based, 3 heat zones... picked it up second hand with a pick and place machine.... 
wouldn't do it again!   I can't even source the BOM more cost effectively than the Chinese can supply turn key solution.    
For prototyping of single sided boards I would suggest a hot plate is fine, we used one for years before we had the oven, no issues, plus you can push any components around that don't snap into place.   Hot plate is good because it heats the component foot prints first, important if you have thick components,  no point soaking plastic connectors with heat, when you are just trying to solder the feet.  Double sided boards are a different issue, then I would suggest a single draw style oven but I haven't personally tried one.

It's a 65w iron but only if you supply it at the top end of it's wide voltage range.  Perhaps your power source was limiting it? 

You can also change the tips (which include the heating element) 

I haven't had any issues soldering xt60 or mt90 connectors.

huh, maybe that's that case. I was using the PSU that came with it, which i'm sure is different from yours.
