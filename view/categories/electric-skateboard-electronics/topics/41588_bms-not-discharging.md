Hello,

I've been working on a small battery pack(3s2p) and i've bought a bms for it
https://www.ebay.com/itm/3S-11-1V-25A-w-Balance-18650-Li-ion-Lithium-Battery-PCB-BMS-Protection-Board-st/272698085757
I've charged all the cells beforehand speratly and then connected them. I've used a small part of a LED strip to test. when i put it directly on the battery it works fine. but as soon as i put a load on the output of the bms the voltage drops.(without load the output gives a normal 12V)

anyone here who could help me figure out what is wrong
thanks.
