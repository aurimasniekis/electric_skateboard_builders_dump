Would Parallels work fine? Boot camp? Is there a way to get an older windows for free or do I just have to buy windows 10 as well?

If you’re feeling a little adventurous or don’t have Parallels, you can install Qt on your Mac, get the Linux source files, and then compile the code. 

This is how I run Ackmaniac’s version on my Mac, and it works like a charm.  Installing Qt was a minor struggle, but otherwise it was fine. It took me about 20 minutes to figure out. 

I don’t have time right now to write up the instructions, but maybe someone else does or if there’s interest I can draft something up later.

If you only want to use Windows for the VESC Tool, you probably don't need to buy it. You can download a virtual machine image with Windows from Microsoft for free:

But as @squad said, there's really no need for Windows. You can run the VESC Tool natively on your Mac.
