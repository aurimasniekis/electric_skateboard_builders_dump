```
so the mini usb port on my vesc randomly fell of while i was riding today and so i contacted diy electric skateboards to see if they could help me with the issue and unfortunately they wouldn't help so i came here to see if anyone would know how to repair my vesc. i need someone who could solder a new mini usb port back on there as i am not nearly skilled enough to do so
