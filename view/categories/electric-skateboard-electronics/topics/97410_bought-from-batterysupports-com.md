Hello, I was browsing after a 10S battery pack, and stumbled across this site: batterysupports.com

and I found this pack: http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-37v-42v-6000mah-60ah-30a-lithium-ion-liion-battery-pack-p-376.html

I wondered if any of you have had any experience with these guys and their batteries before?

That packs seems to be made out of low quality cells (guessing from dimensions) I wouldnt cheap out on a battery, because if your battery is crap, everything else will be as well as it is the most important part

@Acido do you have any shops you buy from that are decently cheap?

Actually I'm pretty sure that pack uses the Samsung 30q, I cant remember the thread, but someone on here has used them.

You can PM @hyperIon1 and he can build you a battery... I have two of his batteries and they are great. Plus you can get any size you want.

Shipping batterys isn't fun. Most vendors don't internationally

So the website BatterySupports is actually a legitimate seller and I have bought 5 or 6 BMS's from them and all of them are working excellent still.  They are the only seller besides Bestec that I trust to keep my batteries balanced.

That being said, I don't know about their batteries, I have heard good things about their chargers.  If like another comment said, they use Samsung cells, I would lean more towards trusting them, but again if the price is too low, I don't know.

If you can wait ~1 month I will be getting a shipment of 12S2P packs with a 50A BMS (100A burst) powerd by Sony VTC-6 30A cells, LCD battery readout, and one plug charging.  They will also include a 3A charger and enclosure for ~$320

These are rated for 60 battery amps, 6.2Ah, and charge from empty in 2 hours.  They weigh 3.1lb all up and are 23mm thick.

These are very new batteries too which I am excited about; almost all 2P packs are limited to 30A at the max, and thats usually pushing the batteries/BMS.

That’s so not fully correct though. Vtc6 is not a 30A cell even if the data sheet say so. 
Check mooch battery test vtc6 and you will get the information about that.
Not sure if you wanted to say the cells are new like not used or new like new on the market. They not new on the market just in case...
Vtc6 2.68€ per cell from ru.nkon.nl as legit seller
https://ru.nkon.nl/sony-us18650vtc6.html

Thats 64€ for cells plus shipping.
So charger, enclosure, bms, Material and time are like 250$ ish than.

Nah, just new in factory built longboard packs.  Every state-side or otherwise 12s2p pack i've seen has been 30Q and limited to ~25-30A discharge.  I think some people have built their own with these cells but am not 100% sure. I am totally aware these have existed in the market for a while, otherwise I definitely wouldn't have touched them haha

I've tested some genuine VTC6 test cells I was sent from the factory with a multimeter and 30A fuse at 27-28A for about 2 minutes and temperature reached 150F.  I'm not questioning any testing anyone else did I just know the cells I was sent were close enough to the 30A rated output that I was happy enough to buy some packs.  

I am not expecting these to be 30A per cell continuous, even at 30mph I pull ~20A total from my 12s4p 30Q pack and I weigh 160lb; the 30A per cell is just a burst capability for <30 seconds or when climbing hills.  The BMS is rated for 50A continuous so they would never reach the 30A per cell draw either way.

Also the price hasn't been decided yet but considering these are factory built bulletproof packs with a 3A charger, 50A BMS, and LCD screen the price is reasonable imo.  For example, diy sells this pack with 30Q and 30A BMS + enclosure for $330; which is basically a downgrade of these packs with a smaller charger.  Mine also include a temperature sensor to cutout power if you push the pack too hard.

30q are 20A cells, so 2p... 💁‍♂️
Anyway i‘m not questioning the price. Everybody can sell what he want for the price he want. If people ready to buy it than why not.

One thing I would as buyer ask is, who and how it is guaranteed that it’s legit cells, legit nickel and a good save build quality.

Those things are more important as the price in my opinion.
Unfortunately there where too much people out there building sketchy packs which in best case just not performed how they should and in worst case burned something down.

Don’t get it wrong, it’s nothing against you and i have no idea what packs you get build or build by your own for others, so with all that i‘m not speaking about yours in specific.

Yea for sure, I understand the concern.  I've never had 30Q output that continuously but to each their own.  

The supplier is Matrix Battery out of China: http://www.matrixbattery.com/

Here is their history: theyve been around since 1999 and have held the proper licensure for longer than that.
http://www.matrixbattery.com/About/index.html

They manufacture all sorts of batteries, primarily lead acids, as well as custom built 18650 packs.  They've been in the game for ages and have lots of guarantees and contracts protecting anyone buying a battery from me; in addition they offer one year warranties.  I am not worried about quality from a company that makes hundreds of different batteries imo.  I've seen the manufacturing process and comparable packs they've built and it's top notch.

I understand the worry but in my opinion it's hard to get pre builts better than these and I wouldn't want anyone to have a bad experience with their battery either.  I had a racing drone pack explode on me a year ago that destroyed my entire room and tens of thousands of dollars of my belongings.  It's one of the reasons I'd rather not buy or make my own packs out of fear that a single manufacturing mistake can be fatal.

Matrix you say?

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/brand-new-12s5p-battery-wont-charge-anymore/95819?u=andy87

Meanwhile the pictures are down but they used pictures from the eskating.eu to sell there packs. According to the vendor they never produced packs for them thou 🤔

There was one guy ordered from them a while ago some 10s3p 30q packs and sold the ones he didn’t need off for 220$

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/10s3p-samsung-30q-inr-18650-3000mah-3-6v-9-0ah/71522?u=andy87

Quality seems ok. Definitely some things on them I personally would be considered about but others would ride them.

🤷‍♂️ one person complaining with zero information about what went wrong with his battery vs one guy showing a well manufactured battery.  I'd lean on the side of high quality considering some pack builders dont use protective siding or foam and just heat shrink their packs and call it a day.  Also mine will be single layer and not contacting each other.

There some pictures in the thread of the 10s3p. You and everybody else can decide by there own if that looks enough professional build or not 💁‍♂️

Complaining? Maybe pay more attention to content rather than context. I specifically said: "No idea why the battery did this all of a sudden." What more information can I give other than describe what I had experienced in as best detail as I can summarize? And at no point did I ever dis on the manufacturer. It was in hopes that if anyone else had ever come across this before they could give me some guidance. 

As it turns out - and I still need to update my original posting - because just a few hours ago I found out what the problem was. After much understandable hesitation I pulled the battery apart very carefully and discovered not only some exposed conductor through the insulator of one of the negative lead wires, 

![20190614_005333_LI|666x500](upload://piG2JiC1ivgcAQ9GERsHkJcrZF3.jpeg) 

upon further disassembling of the pack I also found that one of the BMS positive wires had completely broken loose from the [IDK what it's called but it looks to be some sort of BUS bar (seen just below where I am holding the wire in the pic below) where several other positive wires all are soldered to it] metal piece. I consider myself very lucky in that had that wire touched any of the negative "BUS" bars, again lack of better wording so please forgive me, it could have potentially thrown an arc like you are welding something, maybe even have caught fire...Anyways, after soldering that wire back to where it belonged the battery began to properly charge again.

![IMG_20190622_205825|375x500](upload://e7PguGFZrDXwJsQ8kUn4Q3ucM5w.jpeg) 

The small dab of black at the end of the wire is where I applied liquid insulator to protect the wire from shorting as I worked.

A closing thought: Though the battery arrived with faulty power on/off buttons and an LCD screen that does not properly report voltage and % charge, I would still give Matrix benefit of doubt as they worked with me very closely in troubleshooting the issues as they arose. When I reported the broken on/off switch they proposed a solution to put a circuit breaker inline with the XT90 connector and promptly refunded me for the cost of said breakers. Furthermore, they had also mentioned that had the troubleshooting/solution I described above lead to discovering that the batteries or the BMS had been bad instead of just a detached wire they would have replaced the items at no cost. Fortunately it didn't come to that. I realize that your average consumer likely would not have been willing to go through what I went through - and they shouldn't have to, messing with batteries at these voltages and having this much amperage available to discharge instantly can quickly ruin ones day, especially your eyesight, it is no exaggeration to say you are welding at that point- I saw it as a learning experience and am one thankful for it. Inconvenient as it may have been and honestly, I hope it never happens to me or anyone else again, I would still buy from Matrix as they at no point gave me any indication that I would be left hanging with 
a bunk several hundred dollar battery. And lets face it, the fact they are in China I would have had zero recourse to try to recoup any of my money through legal means, and they easily could have done just that.

And they did use foam in their builds as well. It is quite a sturdy battery all things considered. Admittedly, now I have a functional battery but it has been torn down (foam and paperboard all removed) and I'm still waiting for Matrix to reply as to how I am going to return it to usable operational condition (ie: taping the wires in place, adding foam back to where it belongs, wrapping it with paperboard - most of foam/paperboard was torn/destroyed pulling it apart - and shrink wrapping the exterior to the condition it was in when I received it).

The one downside to buying batteries from Matrix is the lead time. I had to wait 6 weeks from the time I paid them to the time I received the batteries. If you are needing battery sooner you may wish to find a prefabbed one in your area or your home country.
