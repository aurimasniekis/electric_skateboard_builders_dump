Hi! I'm going to plan where to put batteries and other electronics on my board, so i was thinking- if i'll put my enclosure on rear side of a board (just near by motor), the board the will be out of balance. Front will be very light, but back heavy. So does it change a performance or not too much?

You are standing with both feed on each side of the board. 
Compared to your weight the electronic's weight does not really matter.

This ain't no RC airplane or heli so center of gravity doesn't matter really. Unless you plan to make it into a multirotor :smiley:

Doesn't matter other than just carrying as @Hummie said
