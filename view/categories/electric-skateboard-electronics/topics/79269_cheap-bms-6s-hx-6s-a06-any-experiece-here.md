Hi everyone
I'm about to complete my first build. For now I have a VESC on a torqueboard motor, powered from 2 6s lipos in series and ON/OFF capability provided by a vedder anti-spark switch. 

Everything is running just fine, but since I got tired of unplugging everything and use a balance charger, I bought two of these 6S BMS here [from aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/6S-22-2V-Li-ion-18650-Lithium-Battery-BMS-Charger-Protection-Board-with-Balance-Z10-Drop/32872955709.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.321.1f5756509NE268&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_1_10065_10068_10890_319_10546_317_10548_5730311_10696_453_10084_454_10083_5729211_10618_10304_10307_10820_538_537_536_10843_10059_10884_10887_100031_321_322_10103-10890,searchweb201603_53,ppcSwitch_0&algo_expid=a8e7362a-03f2-455c-803f-01eb481dd300-47&algo_pvid=a8e7362a-03f2-455c-803f-01eb481dd300)

anyone of you guys have any experience with those cheap things? any real experience with the reliability?

Just if anyone was going to ask: I was planning to use them only for charging of course and to mechanically disconnect the battery series during charging. Maybe with an anti-spark XT-90 connector.

ciao!
Giuseppe

Wrong purchase at first... then I thought: maybe the more the cheap electronic is the more reliable it will be. 

Maybe

Also I can't find a cheap 12s bms

I appreciate the idea process, but when it comes to esk8, or any choice other than this (because I think this is workable) please dont go with the 'cheaper, might work' option. You risk your safety :(
