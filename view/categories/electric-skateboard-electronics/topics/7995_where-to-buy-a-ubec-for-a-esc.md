I bought [my ubec](https://electric-skateboard.market/product/5v-ubec-for-5-12s-esc/) from @barajabali and have no complaints. It can handle up to a 12S battery and outputs 5V. I power my receiver and led's off of this ubec.

So can I use a separate cheap ubec with a low voltage second battery to power my receiver?

As long as the reciever is getting 5V and 3A it will work.  So in theory I cant see why that wouldn't work but I have never heard of it before.

UBEC is basically a step-down voltage regulator. Which you can have for $2 on ebay. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Buck-Step-down-LM2596-Power-Converter-Module-DC-4-0-40-to-1-3-37V-LED-Voltmeter-/161476280982?hash=item2598bc8296:g:-kcAAOSwyDxXhIGH
