Hey guys,
 I have been looking in the last couple of months for someone to built me a flexible battery pack for my Trampa Urban Carver and since I couldn't find anyone willing to ship the pack to Canada, I have decided to attempt and build one myself.
I aim to have the longest range possible (30+ miles), so I chose to build a 12S7P pack. I know that it may have been a better choice to try and build a smaller pack in my first attempt, but I believe I made enough research and took cautious measures in order to build this beast... and hopefully with your help, I'll manage to nail it. :slight_smile: 
I decided to make this thread, hoping that I will benefit from some more experienced builders pro tips and I also hope that this topic will help other enthusiasts building the pack they desire.

Bellow you can find the layout I designed for this battery (the measurements are just my estimations and not the actual size of the pack).
If you have any suggestions to improve this, please let me know.
Also, if you guys could recommend me a good BMS that I could use and a 5-7 Amp charger, that would be great..
Since I haven't decided for a spot welder yet, I am opened to suggestions for this as well.
Cheers!

Damn that's a big pack but everything is possible.
I got this spotwelder and it works perfectly fine and the price was also okey:

Which cells are you going to use?
I think bestech has the best bms because I guess you gonna use a lot of amps with this build?

I have now a 10S 60A smartbms with bluetooth and it's so handy, in like 5sec I can check everything of my battery pack, every seperate voltage, current, temperatures...
This is the 12S 60A version:

@bartroosen12 Yo man! Thanks a lot for the suggestions! I kinda avoided building my own spot welder, mainly because I thought I would have to use scrap parts... like microwave transformers, etc.. but seeing your recommendation, I think I just changed my mind.. :smile:
The smart BMS (something that I didn't know it even exists) seems like a very appealing options, especially since I like to take advantage of every feature that technology has to offer.
As for the cells, I already bought the Samsung 30Q 18650 3000mAh 15A.. just because I have noticed that most of the builders use these cells...

30Q is perfect!
If you're going to use 2 vescs and put them on 25A battery current each, so a total of 50A max, the smart bms will be fine.
If you want more power you can go for the bestech bms.
I have made a 10S4P with 30Q cells.
![IMG_20180724_095458|666x500](upload://1AetNeG2KoGToDjQzXDyw3EKvOZ.jpg)
I think a lot of people on this forum use this spotwelder.

That looks neat!!!

For now, I'll only use one vesc, put I plan to upgrade to twin soon.. thanks for the tip! ;)
The smart bms you recommended will do perfectly, I think... but just in case, do you have any idea how to order from bestech?

As for the spot welder, I am thinking to go with this one, since for the diy one I will need to buy the car battery.

Kudos for taking on the challenge of building your own battery pack!  If you haven't already done this, I recommend also on addition to of course reading as much as possible on the forum about building the pack, also hit up lots of YouTube videos, especially for how to wire up the BMS and balancing wires etc...  Triple check everything before you make your welds.  You know the saying, lol, 'measure twice, cut once'.  Definitely applies here, especially since electricution and fires can be very serious.  That's a HUGE battery pack to be running through one VESC and one motor.  You'll definitely need to make sure you get your settings right or you could easily fry both :wink:

Also, you saved yourself a TON of money here.  A 12s7p battery pack from a pro builder easily would cost you anywhere from $850-$1000 I imagine your costs for the pack with BMS, charger, anti-spark, voltmeter, etc.. Around $400-$450, so just by building this yourself, the spot-welder has more than paid for itself, and you can use it again to build as many as you want, or sell it off and get that second motor with that money :slight_smile:  Best of luck!

@uigiroux Thanks mate! I watched a few tutorials on YouTube and I also ordered a book DIY Lithium batteries.. plus with the help of other tutorials that I plan to watch and with your suggestions, I hope I will manage to make the battery.
I'm planning each step very careful, especially since it is my first time doing this, but, honestly, I didn't give too much thought to the settings, yet. If you could please explain more what could be the potential causes of frying your VESC or both, that would be awesome. Or a link where I can find more information would be cool as well.
Yup... the price and the shipping issues are the things that pushed me in trying to make my own pack. Plus, I like building my own stuff, so being able to build my own batteries, could be an awesome achievement.
Cheers!

Hey guys,

It's been a while since I posted an update, so here are the 12 packs almost completed. I'll soon start to spot welding all the cells.

I attached bellow a layout explaining how I plan to do the parallel connections as well as the series connections.
For the parallel connections I will use 8 x 0.15T Pure Nickel strips.
As for the series connections I plan to use the Trampa cables with their bullet connectors. Not so sure about the bullet connectors though, I just thought it would be a cool thing if I could detach the packs anytime I want... do you guys think I should use them or not?

I would only put them if you really need to disconnect each group, and don't forget to put heat shrink after connecting

More connectors = more losses and more things to get loose

@Pedrodemio Thanks for the suggestion! I don't really need the connectors, they just would've made my life easier during the building process, but I think I can do just fine without them.

Regarding the BMS, I am still having a hard time deciding between these two:

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/12S-60A-50-4v-bms-12s-2017-new-Li-ion-smart-bms-pcm-with-android-Bluetooth/32833662628.html?shortkey=imaIJrqY&addresstype=600

http://www.bestechpower.com/communicationbms/BMSD328.html

I know that Bestech should be better, but the first one would fit perfectly in my enclosure. I'm pretty sure I could find space for the Bestech one, but it will be quite tight.
So what do yoy guys think? Is Bestech that much better that I should try squeezing it in there?

I have an HS11 deck (which is basically a holy pro without the holes) that gives me an area of 690mm x 230mm under the deck to mount an enclosure:

![44%20PM|690x443](upload://paKFDMTvvYGBi3zu2LR1jUFnHEB.png)

Your street carver has an area of 690mm x 215mm:

![16%20PM|676x454](upload://vrPPy3aVSc3R0O9fOcnvYVLeizU.png)

My enclosure measures about 8 inches, or 203mm wide so I think you'll be able to mount the same enclosure on the street carver.

I got my enclosure from @Eboosted's shop: https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/trampa-hs11-holypro-35-ds/

Do not use hot glue. It gets soft at high temperatures and the vibration stresses go through your welds. 

I recommend medium ca. BSI brand stuff is my personal choice. 

If you really want something with a little more give then try amazing goop or any silicone adhesive sealant. The reason this is better than hot glue is that it can withstand hot temperatures and not come undone yet it is easy enough to undo if you really need to. CA is pretty much permanent unless you rewrap the cells

Thanks a lot guys for all the information!
 Regarding the hot glue, in the tutorials that I watched, no one had specified anything about the type of glue, so I was wondering if it is such a big deal, or can I get away with the standard one I used, since the packs are already assembled?

@PXSS Could you please post a link with the glue you recommend? 

@neiru37 Yes, the Carver deck has 690mm between the points where the deck changes its angle, but the sides are shorter, so I only have 610mm for the enclosure. Anyways, I send a message to eboardperu asking them if they plan to do a double stack enclosure for the Urban carver deck.

The problem with hot glue is how flexible it is. Specially when hot, as it does soften a little at temperatures above 60c. It isn't an issue in most applications but when spot welding batteries, you do not want any flexing between cells as that translates into strain at the welds and eventually the vibrations will break them.

I use CA which is the generic term for super glue, krazy glue, or whatever you may know it as. I use medium CA particularly as it is thicker than standard super glue and gives you a few seconds of work time instead of drying up immediately. 

Here is the one i recommend from amazon:
https://www.amazon.com/Bob-Smith-Industries-BSI-133H-Insta-Cure/dp/B07GBYJN2G
or this one
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0166FFCHS
This one is even thicker but also comes with accelerator which dries up the glue instantly upon application. 

Good luck with your build!

Silicone is also a good choice. The main drawback would be the same as hot glue, it is flexible and not ideal for cells grouped in parallel as most vibrations would affect the weld joints. The other drawback is cure time, at least the silicone that I use at work takes at least 15 minutes to cure before you can even handle it. 

It is a much better alternative to hot glue though as it can handle temperature upwards of 200C without any softening or deformation. There are also silicone compounds that are thermally conductive so it helps with heatsinking to a certain extent.

Another great thing about silicone is that it is a sealant (duh) so if used appropriately, you can make your battery packs waterproof. This is the what I mainly use it for.

Lastly, silicone is not permanent. The one thing I really hate about CA is that if you make a mistake gluing the cells, you are SOL as the only way to remove it is to cut the heatshrink. Using silicone for experimental packs helps me in that if I a configuration ends up not working out, I can reuse the cells by removing the silicone. It is a pain in the ass to do but when I got interns that work for cheap, it is cheaper to have them unglue the cells than buy new ones.

I used heat proof silicon and after 400 km it is perfect! bonding cells with silicon and then with transparent heat shrink it makes the battery pack very firm and in any case for the vibrations I always add a thin layer of foam.

Hey guys,

Thank you for taking the time to give me all those information, they were really helpful!

SInce @neiru37 share his awesome built with me, I changed my initial plans and now I am trying to build a 12S8P battery.

 I have been looking on Eboardsperu trying to find an enclosure for a double layer pack, but it seems they only have a 12S4P that would fit my Urban Carver Deck.
However, I have contacted Alan from Eboarsperu and he said he is willing to make a double layer version of the 12S4P enclosure( link bellow), only if there would be at least 3 orders for it, so he would cover half of the expenses for the mold.
So, if there is anyone interested in such a big enclosure, please DM me?
Cheers!

This enclosure will only work with the cells in the orientation @neiru37 used on his HS11 deck, @vladmrk have already spot welded your cells?, can you modify the packs?

Is there anyway you would be willing to upgrade your deck to an hs11/HolyPro, that would give you an enclosure solution immediately. 

With such a high discharge power and weight you are planning to run on this board you might consider this post and take my advise to upgrade the deck:

Hey Alan @Eboosted! Thank you for your reply!
I was aware that I had to change the whole layout in order to fit the 12S8P pack and fortunately, I haven't spot welded the cells yet. I just finished removing all the hotglue and replace it with silicon. Since this is my first build, I didn't want to go for CA which is permanent, like @PXSS suggested.

Regarding the deck, I am afraid I can't upgrade to an HS11. That would mean that I would have to change the trucks as well and since I already paid around 2000$ for an Electric Urban Carver, I will end up using only the VESC 6 and the wheels, which means less than 500$. I could try to sell it, but I really like how the carver feels in the urban environment where I mainly use it.

Since I live in Canada and the winter is about to come, the enclosure is not a priority at the moment, though it would be nice to have it. My initial plan was to modify a Trampa underdeck enclosure by adding a 1 cm thick rubber straps between the deck and the enclosure(on top of the rubber gasket), thus creating enough space for the double layers. I could apply the same principle to your carver enclosure. From your experience, do you think that could work?

I have read the tread about the broken carver deck and I understand your concern. I don't plan to hit anything at 30km/h and if I were to do that, I think the deck will be the last of my problems hahaha.

Cheers mate!

Why do you want such a large battery?
I think I have one the largest batteries at 8S13P (1310Wh) on a cruiser but that is so I can ride well over 100 miles on a single charge. Weeks usually go by between charge cycles.

Honestly. If I were to do it again, I would go with a smaller battery. The weight of my battery alone is over 10lbs. 

There is no reason to go higher than 6P. If you really want more power, go with a Lipo.

wow.. 100 miles on a single charge?! that's a lot!
Well, I aim for such a big pack for the same reason as you did, I think... more range. I usually bike a lot and I want to be able to do the same tracks with my board. From my calculations, a 12S4P is not enough, not even a 5P, that's why I aimed for a 12S7P. I assume I could get over 40 miles with it. When I discovered I could get away with 8P, the idea seemed very appealing, but I think I would stick wit the 7P, since it is less troublesome, from the enclosure point of view.

12s7p is too big of a battery you will end up regretting, the weigh must always be a concern, not only because you won't be able to lift it but because it'll be less maneuverable, more mass to accelerate and stop, more time to charge, almost impossible to balance, you won't use the full discharge potencial, very dangerous it it ever catches fire and so on.

I am aware that this pack won't be as simple or lighweight as a 12S4P, but since there are people that have already built similar packs or even bigger, I didn't saw any reason why I shouldn't try to built one, especially since I like to be very cautious when building it.

Could you please explain why it would be almost impossible to balance? Shouldn't the BMS take care of that?
I don't plan to ever fully discharge it, that's the reason why I aimed for such a big pack... having 30+ miles range should be enough for me, though I think the battery is capable of 40 miles.

one 18650 cell weights 46 grams... adding another parallel to 12s is only a little over 500g... On a board with a person... You are adding 500 grams to 90 kg+... that's half a percent of the total weight... That's nothing...

that's exactly what I thought... only the batteries for a 12S7P pack weight almost 3.9 kg... comparing that with the most commonly used 12S4P that weights around  2.2 kg, there is a difference of 1.7 kg. My camera weights more than that. :D
I am more concern about the technically issues like why would be impossible to balance such a pack. I've read Micah Toll's book DIY lithium batteries and watched several tutorial and never heard about this issue. Can someone please explain?
Also, If anyone has some tips about how can I make sure it won't catches fire or some recommendations for a BMS, that would be great. @bartroosen12 suggested to use a smart BMS, which I am taking into consideration, but if anyone has other suggestion, it would be much appreciated.

Cheers!

On batt safety there some tips here https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/looking-for-feedback-on-the-battery-i-built/69287?u=lrdesigns 

And use search For boards on fire those threads have a lot of ideas. 

About the balancing. IF your p groups got out of balance for some reason it would take forever to re-balance them as the BMS balance current is only like 50ma. On the other hand large p groups SHOULD stay in balance more easily.

This makes no sense,

First, if you use quality cells and build your pack accordingly there will be hardly any unbalance at all, I'm probably at 100 charge cycles and can't measure any diference between cells with my 2 decimal digits multi meter, that's without a BMS and never balance charging

Second, no cells will be exactly equal, this can cause they to go off balance, but, the higher the P you go the more you smooth out the diference between groups, so less capacity (and due to that voltage) diference you have between groups


What makes sense is, for the same BMS model, that has the same balancing current, connected to packs that have the same voltage diference but one has more P groups than other, the larger one will take longer to balance since is has to bleed more energy from the higher voltage groups

Do not worry about all the "non sense" about lithium batteries people talk about... You don't even need to balance, only sometimes... If you use new cells and they are all the same... Good cells will not go out of balance and that little will be dealt with by a BMS.

A guy that builds batteries tells me some of his friends don't even use a balancer and have been riding for more than a year, battery holding up nicely... I am not saying that is wise, just that all the stuff about not charging to 100 percent etc... all the way up to "do not use parallel connections, as that is very dangerous" It's all bull... :)

I think the concern being expressed is, on most bms we talk about here, the balancing current is 50-100ma, which is really tiny relative to pack size. If there _is_ an imbalance and you're using a fast charger, it's very likely the charge will be terminated before balance is achieved. If you keep going, it'll fall further and further out of balance.

This all depends on the behavior of the charger and bms though.

In case you're still curious 7 months later (I'm about to build a 8p pack w/DieBieMS so was curious too): it will stop charge current when needed during balancing:

- when any p group exceeds a cutoff voltage a flag will be set to stop charging [here](https://github.com/lazar-us/DieBieMS-Firmware/blob/eea8e1adf956917d7bc3f74e46facd1569777dbb/Modules/Src/modPowerElectronics.c#L327)
- the next call of `modPowerElectronicsUpdateSwitches` will [turn off charge current](https://github.com/lazar-us/DieBieMS-Firmware/blob/eea8e1adf956917d7bc3f74e46facd1569777dbb/Modules/Src/modPowerElectronics.c#L392)
- next time the voltage monitor runs past [here](https://github.com/DieBieEngineering/DieBieMS-Firmware/blob/f2544609d6ab8cce50e43587ef145d9618421624/Modules/Src/modPowerElectronics.c#L365) it'll notice `chargeAllowed` has flipped will call `modPowerElectronicsUpdateSwitches`
- the next state loop will [here](https://github.com/lazar-us/DieBieMS-Firmware/blob/eea8e1adf956917d7bc3f74e46facd1569777dbb/Modules/Src/modOperationalState.c#L68) will switch into state `BALANCING`
- there is no transition back into `CHARGING`, but [once balance improves](https://github.com/lazar-us/DieBieMS-Firmware/blob/eea8e1adf956917d7bc3f74e46facd1569777dbb/Modules/Src/modPowerElectronics.c#L345) `chargeAllowed` will be set back to `true`, and the charge current will be restored
- this can happen even after the transition to `CHARGED`, so your pack may still be balancing when "charged." This is stealth balancing (no indication of it except over uart) which I'm not sure I like. Shouldn't stay in this state for too long but I don't think you'd notice if it did.

(Sorry for necro but with more and more big packs being built maybe that'll be useful to someone.)

Hey guys,

Thank for your suggestions and sorry that I haven't been very active lately!
Since the long canadian winter has passed, I think it is time to try and finish my build.

I have made the parallel connection and now I am planning the make the series connections using Kaly's PCBs. I am a bit worried about the parallel ones, cause my spot welder was acting a bit weird at the beggining. They seem fine, but again, I am no expert. Since I'll be using the PCBs I assume there won't be too much stress on them. What do you guys think?

For the BMS, I went with @bartroosen12 suggestion and bought 12S 60A smart BMS from aliexpress.
I have noticed that the balancing cables aren't long enough to reach the last two battery packs. Would it be ok if I solder some remaining cables from the first packs to extend those?

Cheers,

Vlad

I made my 12s8p a similar way. I didnt need my battery to be flexy but i wanted to connect the p groups in series with silicone wires because it will handle vibrarions better long term than a solid connection.

Good job

Just checked your board man... 12S8P and 4wd, looks sweet man!
 Did you use and anti-spark loopkey or a fuse to protect your board? I am thinking to use both, though I am not sure if it's recommended...

What fuse did you use? I am thinkin to go with a 60A since my BMS has 60A. I assume you must have a 100-150A, since you have a 4WD?!

ah, that makes sense! Thanks a lot for the info! I'll be thinking if I will put a 10A fuse as well, though I'll be using a Cycle Satiator charger, which I know is pretty reliable.
Since I am a bit paranoid about the batteries catching fire, I am still planning to use a fuse on the discharge wire. Do you know if I should put an 80A or even 100A one, just to avoid more the situation you described?

Hey guys,

I managed to finish the battery and I would need some help to set up the BMS. I have connected it to the PC, also to my phone and it connects smoothly. The default settings look pretty good to me, so I am not quite sure what I need to adjust or modify. Since it's a new pack, it looks pretty balanced... do I need to do a manual calibration? @bartroosen12 Do you have some tips or some links where I can find more information about setting up this smart BMS?

Cheers!

That's a sick pack man!

The default setting were pretty good already,
I only changed the settings overvoltage settings a bit higher (4.3V) and the undervoltage to 3V per cell so the unity will do the voltage cut off and not the bms, bms should only cutoff in cases when there's really something wrong.

Then I set the balancing mode only when I'm charging my pack when voltage reaches 3.8V but you can do this setting also on the app, I find it easier to change this on the app.

So balancing mode: turned on

Balance type: charge

And what about the charge and discharge amperage, should I set those too?

@M77 Thanks for the suggestion! Each balancing wire is cover with an extra rubber tube(the black one), except for 3 of them on which I used multiple shring heat tubes. Though I am pretty confident that it should be fine, I might open the pack and use some kapton tape to seal the each pack's terminals. Cheers man!

Thanks man! I wasn't sure what cables to use for the series connections either, so I decided to go for the Trampa ones... you can't go wrong with that haha.
 I attached link below. I think they are 12AWG, but I am not sure. 
The lenght was around 3cm, one cm for each connection, leaving 1 cm distance between the packs (I was quite limited by the space in my enclosure, if you have more space, I reccomend to make them a bit longer).
 So far, it's holding really well I'd say. The Trampa cables seem really good, the only thing you should worry about is the soldering. If you haven't done this before, I'd suggest watching some tutorials on soldering. I messed up on my first attempt, but after watching some videos, I think I nailed it and those cables are going anywhere. :)

I don't know how I thought these batteries were too big only 1 year ago, things have gone berzerk with huge battery packs and now they are kind of standard. Next up will be a 13S8P made of 21700 Samsung 100T or some crazy sh!t

Now there are Bioboards with 12S6P, not to mentioned Kaly and Lacroix having 12S12P batteries on their boards. If I am not mistaken, Kaly posted recently a board with a 12S18P which is absolutely insane haha.
