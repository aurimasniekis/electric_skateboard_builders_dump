Hi there guys, 
I've been doing research for about 2 months now for my eboard build and still haven't really found a conclusive answer to my question. At the moment I have a mono drive diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-single-motor-mechanical-kit/ and a vesc and 6355 190kv motor also from .  I recently made an order off hobbyking for 5 2s 5000mah 40c zippy lipos and plan to build a pack similar to @Namasaki  http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/high-power-10s-lipo-battery-pack-with-bms/10014. In the future i plan to upgrade to a dual motor setup.

 So, here are the options that i think i have and i was hoping for some clarification as to which one to choose (cheaper is better as I'm still in high school :wink:). I just want to add that bestech is off the list as their min order is two. Also, I'm in New Zealand btw. 

So, from what ive seen batterysupports is the place to go after bestech, but i don't know whether to go for a 60a or 80a bms if i plan to climb some killer hills with dual motors in the future,
http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-37v-42v-10s-60a-10x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-267.html
http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-37v-42v-10s-80a-10x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-389.html

Yet, I have found some BMS's on Aliexpress that look really good, and, I was wondering why i haven't really seen anyone using them. 
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10S-60A-version-S-lipo-lithium-Polymer-BMS-PCM-PCB-battery-protection-board-for-10-Packs/32730392818.html?spm=2114.13010308.0.0.BePDpc

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10S-120A-42V-lipo-lithium-Polymer-BMS-PCM-PCB-battery-protection-circuit-board-for-10-Pack/32727287969.html?spm=2114.13010308.0.0.BePDpc 

Then there is this one on ebay that looks identical to batterysupports bms 
http://www.ebay.com/itm/36V-37V-42V-10S-60A-Lithium-ion-Li-ion-Li-Po-LiPo-Polymer-Battery-BMS-PCB-System-/221769582503?hash=item33a27f47a7:g:VV0AAOxywCJRa-m2

Cheers guys for your help

Not really and I couldn't find its dimensions in the description though it looks rather large. Maybe double the size of the one I'm using.
I would imagine that it is rather pricey as well.

L235*W60*T15mm

HCX-D223V1
L120mm*W80mm*T25mm

So like twice as long but thinner

The length is a deal breaker for me. 
Have you inquired about the price?
It has a lot of features and options. 
Sounds expensive

I just emailed them. 
The last company I asked how much their smart bms costs they said $1500 I think it should be a little less than that.

Hey, Namasaki! I was gonna buy one of these, but there doesn't seem to be any order/purchase button anywhere on the site there; also no price indication either. Where do you buy them from then?

Thanks guys for your help, I tried to contact bestech but they still haven't replied. To be honest I don't really want to go with them as, I'm not interested in ordering 2 boards to meet the minimum requirements for an order which from what i've seen is the case. From the other options there which would be best?? 
Thanks again

Im building a 2x 6355 board which theoretically could pull as much as 125 amps from the battery and I see many people use the 60 Amp Supower BMS. I remember a topic of someone measuring the max amps during an uphill run, and it turned out to be much less than the max advertised amps of the motors. Is it correct that in practice you'll rarely pull more than 60 amps and therefore the Supower is suitable, even for discharge?

Just what i do atm:
Take the smallest BMS i can find, bypass discharge and use a fuse with my desired rating. Need the space for batterys!

## \#19 Posted by: smurf Posted at: 2017-04-03T18:29:23.607Z Reads: 434

Unless it's a mountain board 60 amps is plenty

@Nordle for real there has to be a better way to save 20 bucks than cheap out on the BMS.

Bestech 80A 10S smart bms

$150

Do you think that is a fair price?

## \#21 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-04-04T02:41:34.190Z Reads: 412

```
The one I use is only $49 + PayPal fee and shipping.
$100 is a lot to pay more for an onboard fuel gauge and to be able to adjust settings at home. And that doesn't include the extra you have to pay for the module to connect to your PC.
I don't think its worth it. But thats just my opinion.

Money isn't the reason for me, as i told it is space. And i will keep doing so till a decent but still small bms is available.

From Germany:
Smart BMS 10s, about 80A. So you can choose what cutoff Voltage you like, when it should start balancing and so on.
Also itÂ´s one of the smallest bms around:

```
Maximum NCR18650B discharge amp limit is 6.7 Amps under continuous current load.

these cells have too low current capability for Eskate
You would need at least 100 cells for a mediocre pack. Cost $411 not even a bargain.

You could do something like this build I did, it's Small, Light weight and powerful. 300a constant 600a peak 5000mah.
The cost for 5 of these 2s  packs is about $130

If you prefer to use Li-ions, the word on the street is Samsung 30Q are the cells to use.

Can I use this BMS with [that](http://www.enertionboards.com/on-sale/r2-spare-battery/) battery? Because I was wondering vor quite some time now, how it is supposed to be connected. The BMS has 10 balance ports altough it is 10s4p. I thought with a 10s battery you are supposed to have 11 balance cables. Because the battery from the above link has 11 balance cables. Is there anything different in the wireing?
