Just wondering if these wires

http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__102160__JST_SH_6Pin_Male_Plug_with_200mm_Wire_Pigtail_5pcs_.html

would plug into the vesc sensor port, as then I could use these to wire from 5 pin to 6 pins.

Thanks

you want JST-PH 2.0mm 6pin.  The ones you linked are 1mm pin spacing.  Will not fit the VESC.  You need the 6 pin JST-PH 2.0mm:
