I made this video so that people can work out how to open up the dongle to get the receiver out of the nyko kama.
I was going to make it into a whole video part on how to solder the wires on, but circumstances have left me unable to film that part yet. I will certainly get it done some time in the future though.

Those are pretty short wires.
Aren't you worried about RF interference from the VESC ?

no, not really.
Its for testing, so If I do see any affect from RF I'll be sure to report back.

I accidentally put this through the washer and drier this week, because I left it in my pocket when the hack board was in push assist mode. 
happy to say she still works :)

actually these things are pretty solid.. I accidentally ripped it in half the other day, I didn't realise there are actually 2 boards, one smaller one soldered on top of the other. I pulled on the top one and ripped it clean off.
thought it was done for but I soldered them back together and all good!

then I put it through the wash..

still good

Do you think there is a way to add a longer antenna?
