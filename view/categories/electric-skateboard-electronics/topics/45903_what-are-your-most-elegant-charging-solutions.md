Hi, first time builder here, just looking for a good solution for charging my board to make sure that the batteries do not deteriorate in any way too quickly. I was going to the charging port from a hoverboard/swegway + a cheap BMS but that looks to be not waterproof and would take to long to charge / burn out the batteries very quickly.
Please share your top tips for charging your board for me and all of the other eboard enthusiast to learn from. Thanks for you input in advance.

If it helps, here is the setup I have for my board so far. Obviously it is not finished so any other input you happen to have for me would also be appreciated.
