Hey,
I got me a Steez remote from ProtoBoards to replace my Winning. Everything seems to work but I recognized a problem while using the cruise control or constant throttle mode (b-button). The brake is not responding like usual but only at the very end of the negative throttle way. It is literally an emergency brake. Is it possible to adjust some parameters in the bldc tool to smooth the braking behavior while in cruise control?
regards
