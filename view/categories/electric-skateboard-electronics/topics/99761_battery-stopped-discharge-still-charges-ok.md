I have a torqueboards 6s3 pack like this one, about a year old:

https:///collections/electric-skateboard-battery-pack/products/6s3p-electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack

 It suddenly stopped providing discharge current. Toggling the switch has no effect, and the lcd does not show any sign of life. However the lcd turns on and shows state of charge percent when hooked up to the charger. How do i trouble shoot this? Could it be one of the bms leads rattled lose or something else?

If you decide you want a new pack, i can build one for significantly cheaper than them.

Iâ€™d suggest removing the heatshrink and checking for continuity. That will tell you what part is broken. If you post pics once unwrapped that would help or reach out to @torqueboards
