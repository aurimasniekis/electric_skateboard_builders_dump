Hi Everyone,

I recently finished a build using the xcar beast 150a running at 6s.  I'll post pictures soon!

I bought the HobbyKing LCD Program Card, and am having issues programming with both the LCD Program Card itself and through the USB connection.

With the LCD program card, I get extra setting options (e.g., some settings seem to have multiple numbered profiles).  When I enter settings, they seem to take based upon handling of the board, but the display on the card doesn't seem to match the setting.  The USBLink Software doesn't recognize the card or controller.  Itss on Windows 10.  Any ideas?

Quick question.  Did you get the USB connection to work on a Windows 10 computer?  Or did you have to use a prior version of Windows?

```
the program card worked fine for me with the 120a version....
not that the settings made the esc any better...
between the esc, card and usb link you could have just bought a vesc and been done with a much nicer ride....



don't know why people keep cheaping out $30 when it could literally be your life on the line when the breaks fail...
