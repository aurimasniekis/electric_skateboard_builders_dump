Hello,
Do you know a source to buy PCBs to build a 18650 pack. Preferably 3p but 4p would do.
Electricrepair is out of stock.

Also If you have gerber files, I could send it to a PCB shop (if I find one who does 3oz layers).
Thanks

Nice. How thick is the layer ?
How much do you want for 20 (shipping to France) ?

They are only 1oz since thats all I needed for 3p 30q batteries

3oz is super overkill
