I was wondering if there was a specific order to solder/connect the wires on the two pins at the back  of a 5.5 Jack socket. There is a short one and a long one.
Thanks

Its up to your plug, what i did was, i plug my charger to the socket, get a voltmeter,  check where is the + and (-) on the pins, 

Or usually the smaller is (+)  

Hope this could help

Long is normally ground/negative.

I'd put a multi-meter on it to make sure if you want to be safe...
