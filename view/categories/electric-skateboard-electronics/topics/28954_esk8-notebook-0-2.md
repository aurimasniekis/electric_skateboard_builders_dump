Whatever **Motormount** I can find or you can suggest

**One 190kv motor**
[Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-190kv Brushless Outrunner Motor](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-190kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html)

Gets power from 2 of these **Batteries** in **series**
[ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 3S1P 20C](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-3s1p-20c.html)

( so it would be a 5000mAh 6S1P 20C ) 

Speed controlled by this **VESC**
[Unik control HW 4.12](https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/vesc-v/)

[Or this one](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/esc/ev-esc/vesc/)

**Remote** controlled by this
[Enertion Nano-X 2.4Ghz Controller](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/nano-x-enertion-2-4ghz-controller/)

Looks good on the **[calculator](http://calc.esk8.today/)**

This topic is much of a "statement" of where I am in the process
Feel free to comment.

I know it is on the lower edge of my desire, but was tolk a 190kv have a great boost, and would like to have that when starting and stopping on intersections.

Right vesc
How could you suggest to charge the batteries in parallel

If you're going 6s then I'd go for a higher KV motor. Perhaps this one instead?

You mention two batteries at 3s
[quote="Tycho, post:1, topic:28954"]
Gets power from 2 of these Batteries
ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 3S1P 20C
[/quote]
Then using them in parallel? or is that just for charging?

That will only be 3s 10000mAh, or series will give you 6s 5000mAh. You will need 4 packs to get 6s 10000mAh.

Was thinking of having two ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 3S1P 20C in **series**.

Then it would be 5000mAh 6S1P 20C.
