Hey People,

I'm still learning, so please forgive my ignorance. I'm looking at building an electric ride on golf trolley. Here's what I'm planning. Wanted to run it by the community before I buy it all and blow myself up. :blush:

2 x Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6354-260kv Brushless Outrunner Motor's
2 x Multistar High Capacity 8000mAh 6S 10C Multi-Rotor Lipo Pack's wired in serial connection.
2 x Maytech 50A VESC's


------
**Update**
Decided to go with the following;
2 x Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6354-260kv Brushless Outrunner Motor's
2 x ZIPPY Flightmax 8000mAh 5S1P 30C
2 x Maytech VESC's

-------

What does everybody think? If there's anything you think I could improve on I'd love to hear it :slight_smile:

Thanks,
Ben.

Take the higher rated batterys. 10c is really low and will cause some celldrifts.
35c or higher is recommended :+1:

Multistar is actually 4C constant discharge, there is a long thread on endless sphere about these _crappy batteries..._

ok awesome thanks guys any recommendations? I need to be able to travel 10 miles up and down hills so big batter is important I guess! Speed / Torque not as important.

2x Zippy 8000mah 5S is a good alternative!

Awesome thank you so much! I'll get those two added to the order list. 2 of those in serial with the above two motors will be fine with the Maytech VESC's right?

I've only tried it with a single maytech VESC and 245kv, but it seems plenty capable to me, and i've seen a lot of others use a similar setup

Great thanks :) I'm looking forward to getting everything ordered and starting my build log. I'm worried I won't have enough juice to carry me + golf clubs for 10 miles up / down hills (The average length of a golf course)

If you go 10S now i would take a lower kv motor. Shouldn't be a problem with the 260kv but you could use lower gearing ratio then.

I have no experience with them, I say they are bad as others on here have mentioned they burn out rather easily. Cheaper components, no warranty, not all manufacturerers are created equal. I'd personally go with Chaka if I bought a vesc right now

From what I've read around the Maytech VESC's are supposed to be pretty good. I'll let you know the verdict once I've got my hands on them. :slight_smile:

Don´t use 10s with such a high kv motor. Pls choose a combination listed below.
Vescs are best to use with 10s systems - not too much current and not too much voltage.
So I recommend 10s with 190kv.

@TarzanHBK ok great thanks for the heads up. Would dual KEDA 63-64 190KV Brushless Outrunner 10S 2000W be ok? [https://hobbyking.com/en_us/kd-53-30-high-voltage-brushless-outrunner-190kv.html](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/kd-53-30-high-voltage-brushless-outrunner-190kv.html) 

It's like a massive sodoku puzzle, change one thing you need to re-think about everything else! :

Thanks @wmj259 but I think I've decided to go for a bit lower KV as a few people have mentioned them.

haven´t heard of this model before, but should work if you have enough space to mount them in a dual configuration.

Hi!
Sorry for hijacking this thread but I have a few questions in regards to the battery OP had initially thought of purchasing. 

I would like to know why @Nordle thinks that they are crappy, and _what_ do you mean by 4C constant discharge when it says 10C discharge? 

Furthermore, I would like to know why the general consensus is that these batteries are terrible.

I am considering pairing this with the following motor: Turnigy D5035-125KV Sensored Brushless Motor 

As far as I know, these batteries are good for up to 80A motors (10C x 8Ah). This motor is 45A so on paper, this should work right? (2x these batteries in serial)

Moreover I would like to know what @TarzanHBK Celldrifs means and how it relates to 10C. Why is 35C recommended?



Thank you all!

A guy from Endlesssphere named "icecube" tested these and rated them 4C or less, because the quality is really bad and they don´t hold up 10c discharge. They are good for low discharge things, but not our application.
If you only run low currents with only flat lands and you´re a lightweight, you may be ok with them.

About Voltage sag. You´ll find some infos in this thread:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lets-talk-about-voltage-sag-poll/12085

and here:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-is-voltage-sag/34209

To avoid sagging as good as possible, use a battery rated as high as possible or the same battery a few times in parallel to take the load combined.

I ordered my VESC direct from Maytech. No problems with it (10S BLDC). I also own a TB VESC. Funny how some people here who have no personal experience with either brand are quick to parrot "it's shit".

[/quote]

I think so because i read a topic on ES-forums where a trusted member tested them and showed his data there. And the graph showed inaceptable voltage sag above 4C. The manufacture say 10C because that sounds nice ya know...

@Nordle So, for this D5035-125KV motor - which has a max amperage of 45A - will this battery be sufficient? 
(x2 in serial)

Do your maths I'm not here for that. but be sure to take the 4C value not 10C

I have done the maths already. But it was more of a theoretical question. The thing is, limiting the VESC to say 30A to drive the motor which is 45A  would still work, correct? (albeit with slower speeds)

I did some research on the whole 4C topic and it seems like there's not sufficient grounds for it actually being 4C (as opposed to 10C). Could you point me to some good evidence? I want to be absolutely sure that it is actually 4C. Because if it turns out to be 10C, then it is a good purchase. 

Thanks :smile:

Same speed but less torque instead. I told you where i read it, if you don‘t believe, search for it.

Shouldn't that depend on how false the burst is? It says 20c for 10 sec but let's assume 8c (double of the 4) which would at max give 64 amp which is "alot" over the max of the motor. Shouldn't they in that case work when accelerating, then keeping the speed does not drain many amps. Does it then really hurt the tourqe that much?
Disclaimer: I'm pretty new at this but I don't see a big problem with them, would love for someone to criticize my way of thought, thanks! :slight_smile:

A battery doesnt like to be maxed out all the time. You have to leave some headroom.
Otherwise it will loose capacity fast and you have to buy a new one. 
Lipos are even more sensitive to that than liion cells.
Leave them some room and they tread you well.
Best to pick some high rated good quality lipos, like some 60c Graphene pack. If you don't wanna spend this much get some cheaper zippys with 35c like mentioned above.
