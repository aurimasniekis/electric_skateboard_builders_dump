Hi Everyone.

I have been browsing Taobao lately and found some pretty interesting stuff. But i have some questions about it. I hope you can help

1. https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-9375755759.41.3dc2ba8pINvvo&id=539730130107

- Can you guys help me with what kind of trucks these mounts works with. I especially like the silver one.

2. https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a312a.7700824.w4002-9375755759.106.9aed064TLVFry&id=539649943859

- Have anyone tried these? i would like to build a board with such wheels, not for mountain but just for everyday use. we have alot of rain where i come from so it would be nice to have.

3. https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.4.322d38d6JtI8oy&id=556043607306&ns=1&abbucket=14#detail

- motors like this looks very tempting. But are they build with good enough matterials. I have before bought a red 50mm motor from ebay and was happy with it. Otherwise i have primary used Turnigy motors. how does this compare to it?

4. https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.5.38de19edE5hrG9&id=542041900411&ns=1&abbucket=14#detail

- Would this work for a board with the 200mm wheels? or is it to bad quality?

Hey @nikoli280. Can i ask you whats you budget for this build. 
I don't recommend going TaoBao route. I did it and i would be better off. I spent like twice as much money because eventualy i replaced all chinese parts for better and more reliable. (Hard wheels, squeaky trucks are just awfull and not to mention the mounts that you need to weld so that they stay put.:upside_down:)
Only thing that i wouldn't argue are the motors you linked. All/most vendors here on the forum are buying them from China. It makes sense. 
I gave you my opinion based on my experiance.
Good luck with your build! :v:

I completely agree with @rok, if you are low on budget, consider buying used things, they will certainly have better quality than chineese craps...

If you do decide to buy some stuff from taobao, i'd suggest using superbuy as your agent, both orders I made went smoothly and without issues.

So you have tried both the wheels and the trucks? Are the wheel really that bad?

I got paris clone trucks with mount and drilled the holes in it so that the screws from the mount could hold to something. Loctite is a must tho. 
The wheels are not bad for the price but yeah, pretty hard. 

I'm selling the trucks and wheels right now if you want to take a look or try them. Its [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-sale-esk8-de-vesc-clone-paris-trucks-with-mount-clone-abec-11-83mm-wheels/43330).

Hi thanks for answer. The ones you sell are not the same wheels or trucks or mounts that i linked. Have you tried the 200mm wheels? I have the same motor mount on my first board and i know how horrible it is. I have completly covvered it in steel epoxy but not a good option

Lol for some reason i thought this was you first build. I didn't try 200mm wheels no.
Oh well, maybe some new guys will find my comments enlightening :slightly_smiling_face:

I'd be down for a group buy of the pneumatic wheels, number 2, if I could get a set like that for under $100.

About that mount: I have it and i don't recommend it.  If you want details, pm me
Edit: you will pay double the asking price because of shipping and fees. If the motor is 30$, you'll pay 60$, but that's only outside China.
