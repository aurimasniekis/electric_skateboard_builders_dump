Anyone have any thoughts on getting some motors and vescs in the UK/EU.
I like the look of Maytech motors but on the face of it they seem very expensive.
Ideally some nice 6355 motors for dual drives or 6374 for singles, around 190kv?
Possibly some larger abec clones too?
Possibly thinking of a group buy to try to get some good prices.
Anyone interested or have any input?

I´m starting with two trampa builds soon and want to have the sealed version. But only if it´s not too fkn expensive.
So I´m interested in 4x 6374

There seems to be a pretty good group buy for mounts at the mo?
Also pulleys if you are using big wheels?

That's a fair point. Decided to hang fire until this board is finished anyway. I must resist stock piling parts for another board....

Some good manufacturers of motors (both offer sealed motors):
http://www.freerchobby.com
http://www.brotherhobby.cn/goods/36.html

Hope this helps a bit

Email them or contact them on Alibaba. They don't feature it on their website or their alibaba site, but they will send you some pictures if you ask them.

I'm currently in a US group buy but since there seems to be low interest, i might be willing to jump on this group buy...

Slowly finding out why there aren't many available..
