That question can be answered by a wiring schematic of your bms.

I bought the battery online but they didn't add the charging cable to the BMS...

Yeah again, find a wiring diagram of your bms. Get on Google, search the type of bms you have and find a wiring diagram showing where everything connects. Its not that hard and you'll have an answer before anyone responds here.

But I don't know the brand. And I don't want to take any risks since it is glued to the battery itself :confused:

BMS should have a brand or model.number on it somewhere try to find it and then Google.

generally P- is charge / load negative, B- battery negative.  i bet you'll see the markings on the PCB if you take cover off..

but it's hard to tell what's happening with yours so please find a schematic first.

^^ this. Look for a p- or a c- , both usually work.

So I wrote to thw guy I bought the battery from and he tells me that I should attach the negative charge port wire to this wire. I find it strange since it is the main negative lead. ![Screenshot_20181211-081034|690x345](upload://aBQoBTIVRpwFXUIq45ZOeaybVi9.jpeg) ![IMG_20181211_081106|250x500](upload://2gDIPC3WnVz0RsoZwNhECQHMC8.jpeg)

```
Your BMS uses low side sswitching so all high side wires are common. I.E. all positive voltage are connected together.

^^^ This

Basically the red wires don't go to the bms. The positive charge port goes straight to the battery
