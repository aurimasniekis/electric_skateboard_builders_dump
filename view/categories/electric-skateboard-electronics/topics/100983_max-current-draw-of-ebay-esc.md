Hello, I want to buy this controller: https://www.banggood.com/2436V-Single-Motor-Electric-System-Driver-Noninductive-Longboard-Skateboard-Controller-p-1381110.html?rmmds=myorder&ID=516800&cur_warehouse=CN
I think it is called here "ebay esc"

I cant find any information about maximum allowed current. Does anybody maybe know it? 
Thank you in advance for your help.

Just a side note, I wouldn't trust my life on that ESC. Your ESC is the heart of your board, and cheaping out on it could be very painful. Both physically and financially. [See this post.](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/are-diy-electric-skateboards-cheaper-the-false-economy/165)

I know, but I also heard that those "ebay esc" are pretty good cheap option and they are even used in market boards.
