Watt mode using ackmaniac firmware

Bluetooth dongle, app and change max watt in app to preferred power level
Good on you ☘️

Thx for your reply , for using ackmaniac firmware, is it better to use BLDC Tool or VESC Tool?
And do you know if there is a remote that can be configured to do these three speed modes without going through the application?
thank's a lot

You have to use @Ackmaniac's [modified BLDC Tool](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/extended-bldc-tool-with-watt-control-mode-ppm-cruise-control-individual-throttle-curve-and-android-app/12286).
