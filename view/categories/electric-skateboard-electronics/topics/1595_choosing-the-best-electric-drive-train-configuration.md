Depending on your weight & riding environment you should customize your electric skateboard drive train to ensure you have enough torque output without over capitalizing. Additional & larger motors are not always necessary.

**Build a system that works for you.**

12mm belt? Is that necessary?

Id love to see a DD with 2 of the big ones! 
Might even be enough to sway @onloop himself.

Do you often have the belt slipping with 9mm ?

It mostly happens under brake force. I'm 95kg. That's why I got wider.

Will a 9mm belt carry a person up a hill though?

I've never had any issues with 9mm belts.  I do weigh about 170lbs, though.

it's more about belt longevity, 9mm in most cases is fine (on mono drive) and will work well for most people, but will have a shorter life expectancy, especially if you are heavy & brake/accelerate hard.

the cost of having 12mm is the same as having 9mm. So going 12mm only brings benefits.
