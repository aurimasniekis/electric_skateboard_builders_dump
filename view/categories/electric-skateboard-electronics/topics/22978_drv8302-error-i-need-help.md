Hi,
Today I have connected my Maytech VESC and I couldnt get it to work...the BLDC tool says DRV8302 Error :frowning:

I am 100% sure there have been no shorts/sparks or anything like that, before the error occured I had embedded my motor leads into the deck (LHB style) with polyester resin and I might have switched them. I also resoldered two leads to the sensors of the motor. That are the changes I made before reconnecting the VESC.

Before the VESC had been running smoothly and I have never had any issue...

Here are pictrues of the VESC

What is the problem with the VESC? May it be manufacturing mistake? Would changing the DRV chip help?

```
Battery Max is a bit high, also you should leave your min/max voltage alone (8/57 default). Some of these settings may have blown the DRV. You'll need to swap it out or get a new VESC. SMD soldering the chip is a bit difficult though. You may want to consult @JohnnyMeduse for a swap.

Ok...few more questions from me :slight_smile:
My friend studies electrotrchnics so he could repair it cheaply for me :) Is there something importnant he should know? 
I have to exchange just the DRV? 
Where can I buy DRV in EUrope? I know I can buy from aliexpress, but are there any european vendors where I could get it faster than 19 days?

No idea about any european vendors, but people typically order off mouser in the States I believe. Just make sure to show your friend Vedder's schematic from his site. There are two pairs of leads that need to be bridged on the chip.

Hi @aigenic, as @Jinra mention always leave min max voltage to the original limits. 

Also, It's look like the integrator limit are the default one, those should have change after your motor detection, maybe you did push the write button after the motor detection, witch could lead to a drv faults

You best choice to get the part fast is probably MOUSER.

hey, just go with mouser. I changed two DRV yesterday that I burnt and to be honest I thought it would be more difficult. It's really accessible if you have an hot air station and patience.

Don't really care about the different Name for the DRV8302, they are packaging types identification.

I am in the same boat! Although this is happening to 2 of my VESCs which have never been used before..... 
are you @JohnnyMeduse still soing repairs in Europe?

I can do repair from Europe, but the shipping cost a little bit higher, and also the delay (because of longer shipping time)....

Is it still usable, if the DRV would be replaced or do I have to buy new one?

IÂ´d get a new one. Too much hussle

Am I cursed or what?! 
So I have bought a new VESC from goaxle.com...after some time it was dispatched and then the parcel got lost...However I got my money back from axle (really nice customer support :O )
So I orerd from Vandaelectronics.com...the VESC was dispatched this monday and it was delivered yesterday....today I checked all the fucking cables, everything is well isolated...and guess what...I connected it and the DRV blew up!!! FUCK THIS

Check your motor resistance ?  Maybe it has a short somewhere. unplug it and try turning it and then hold 2 phase wires together and turn it again. There should be a increase in resistance. 

Also you could check your ramp step setting in the bldc tool. Older bldc_tool versions had an issue there.

[quote="aigenic, post:1, topic:22978"]
I also resoldered two leads to the sensors of the motor.
[/quote]

Just curious, you say you resoldered the sensor leads, but you're using sensorless right?

when the MayTech VFESC failed, it was in sensored, the Vanda VESC was unsensored without sensore wires connected

Your Maytech (OP) screenshots say sensorless. Anyway, you're now saying your Vanda VESC DRV blew up during detection and now fails detection? Could you post pics on how you have everything hooked up, and what kind of battery you have?

About the pics...I am sure everything is hooke up correctly, I took everything apart yesterday and removed all insulating tape from the connectors, when I was looking for the mistake...I dont think the photos of the board, cables and connectors would help. but I can send them :)

Before I my first blown DRV I had hidden cables inside the deck and I had sunk them with polyester resin to hol on place...from what I know Polyester resin is not conductive and also the cables were isolated...I had been using the cables with same isolation before and they were OK, so the reason of the failure might be only the resin, but since they are well isolated there shouldnt be a problem?

COuld it be caused by too long phase motor wires? They are about 20cms long, but as I said I used them without any issue before...

Also 3 of my bullet connectors under the truck are connected to the wires in angle/from the side so they can fit under the truck...Could this cause the problem?

I have 10s LiPo 5000mAh 20C

Ok...im angry...why the fuck me? 
3rd time, all new wires and connectors, everything seems ok, everything well isolated (2 layers of isolation)...i connected VESC to batteries and it gets hot and starts smelling like somthing is being burned...IDK what is wrong, the heat comes fsomewhere from the drv or maybe the coil next to it i am not sure...just constantly flashing red light...i didnt even hit connect in BLDC tool...

I think I giv up on this shit...I have spend too muc hmoney on these VESCs, IDK what i am doing wrong because i always follow guides and there is always something wrong...........

So I was wondering I could buy a normal HV ESC, what ESC do you recommend? 
[This one from APS?](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/esc/alien-120a-3-12s-jet-esc-hv/) Is it reliable?
[Or the MayTech ESC?](http://www.michobby.com/product/maytech-120a-12s-brushless-esc-for-electric-skateboardse-bike-golden-color/) They have too hard brakes am I right? Where can I buy the FVT ESC?

I want simple plug and play solution, no **** VESC, because I dont have luck with this...

just don't buy 4.12, buy from ollin's enertion etc, modified version. you will have less headache.
if you want, you can try fvt sleeping lion, but you have to update firmware, do some experiment with throttle.
