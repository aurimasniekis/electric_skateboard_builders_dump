Totally sorry for the TL:DR but I'm hoping I have enough cred on this board to get away with it :slight_smile:

Has anyone found the perfect battery meter?  Ideally a coloumb counter rather than a volt meter.  I know a lot of cheap chinese counters are coming out - any of them worth it?  Any custom designs I could pick up on? 

I'm becoming more and more concerned about range because I'm finding that pneumies significantly reduce range and I had several cells on my pack come un-welded during a ride so I'm not as sure of the integrity of the pack as I used to be.

In a perfect world I want to discharge the pack completely, attach the counter, charge completely and get a single simple number that represents very accurately the state of charge.

Thanks,

Comercial product I can say

But from all I've seen, solutions based on Impedance Track from Texas are the most accurate

I recommend watching these 3 videos from them if you are interested
