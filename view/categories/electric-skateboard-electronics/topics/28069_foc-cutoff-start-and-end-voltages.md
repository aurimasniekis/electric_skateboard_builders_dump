I am setting up FOC but the two videos I had watched have extremely low cutoff start and end voltages? I'm curious as to why and one of the videos said that it will only work with those set voltages? I'm running 2x3cell lipos in series. Thanks.

Which 2 videos did you watch? Maybe link them here so we know which ones you're referring to. And the voltage cutoffs should be the same as in BLDC tool. It was probably just that the guys making the demo videos used batteries with only a few cells in series so their cutoffs were low.
