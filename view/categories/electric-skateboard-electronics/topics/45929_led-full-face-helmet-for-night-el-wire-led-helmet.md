Triple eight fullface helmet
I go to company with electric board. I go to work early and work late so I can only ride at night. Therefore, it was necessary to secure visibility for safety.
The summer helmet is decorated with neo-pixel LEDs. But I did not want to put a thick LED on the fullface helmet.
So I worked with a thin EL wire.

Some of the styrofoam inside the helmet was broken and a 1S 2000mAh Lipo battery was built.
There is no inconvenience to wear and it is good to look..

not sure i'd remove the foam in a helmet to insert a battery... and if it broke in a crash i'd discard the helmet...

looks cool dude, not sure how safe it is now though?

I'm imagining a crash and the lipo is punctured and goes off inside the helmet next to his head :disappointed_relieved:

Its size is 60x45x8mm. The inner foam was peeled off and covered with a sponge.

Because it is 1 cell, one JST terminal comes out separately.

That's sick you should make full body protection with el wire on it and you would look like a totally badass!!

Do you mean the soft foam padding or the actual foam core of the helmet?

Some of the styrofoam in the full face was extracted and a thin sponge foam for the summer helmet was added.

Sounds like you mean the actual protective EPS? If so you might want to look at another way to do that. My understanding is that it's important that the hard foam is unbroken because otherwise it will just snap rather than compressing and distributing the force of the impact (as well as reducing the acceleration/impulse). Apologies if I misunderstood which foam you mean. 

I really like how the lights look though, I might have to try something similar on my next helmet. Very impressive

It is wooden observatory of ecological park. The telescope is also mounted. The tower shakes more than you think.:confounded:![C0010001_02|427x240](upload://cXyKXErPxnu4mXElECtZtERLK9I.gif)

What's the relation between your board and @wspark Alani Lani? Seems that you share the same motors, apparently the same Gullwing Sidewinder trucks, same T Board Factory mounts and motor covers with translucent lights... (??)

A colleague of mine has developed a T-board and has fixed and tested the problem. Then @wspark has asked for the powertrain part.![20160506_123211|666x500](upload://rDPSTHrXKUpYrdLMHOQnXXOXzox.jpg)![20160804_124356|666x500](upload://AmNCoJ9OK6oN1gvedZV8xcMlbf.jpg)![20171109_111858|666x500](upload://gAQUEh5ERrOg9ilKHJLK3bKvAcS.jpg)![20171114_172933|666x500](upload://eATv0PMDE8Sj6ATt5e3F8gIONdL.jpg)

Tell everyone that they're about to see some serious sh*t. Then take off at 88mph.

I see you're running tandem axles up front. What's the advantage? I've seen it on other rigs too.

With two 80mm wheels, we see the effect of reducing the vibration of a wheel with a larger size. Vibration is low enough to offload a little.

The one thing I noticed that I don't understand is why you would put an LED behind the visor... All it's gonna do is make it reflective so you see your face instead of through it as clear as without...
