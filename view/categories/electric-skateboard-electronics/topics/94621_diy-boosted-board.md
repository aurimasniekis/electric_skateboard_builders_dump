Not possible, not many DIY can even do that. And definitely not possible with boosted little 5055 motor

If the bms from that board is dead ‚Äúwhat is mostly the case off a broken batter‚Äù then you need a new battery, new esc ‚Äúnon official boosted‚Äù

If you want to go up such a steep hill. You better start with a whole new diy. With 6374 motors etc.

I have also such a broken boosted laying at home. I am thinking off taking a boosted xr battery apart. But a new BMS in it & use mini flip sky vesc‚Äôs. Btw: a unity is to big to fit in the boosted esc enclosure.

You can also buy another vesc. But the esc enclosure from a boosted is not that big

You need high current ESC, 200a. High torque motors like 6364 sk3 149kv. You need high output battery, at least 60-80amps, 10s5p 30Q for example.

I think boosted uses even smaller 5045 motors. Someone correct me if I am wrong

I wonder if it would be possible to gear it down so max speed would be like 10mph and just make it chug up steep hills? At first thought I'm thinking the pulley would have to be bigger than the wheel (lol), but maybe not? Strictly academically speaking...

Yeah, I have a similar situation, I have a 40t pulley on a 83mm wheel. And a 12t motor pulley, the bend is probably too much for it to last very long, but it's for science, so I'm ok with it.
