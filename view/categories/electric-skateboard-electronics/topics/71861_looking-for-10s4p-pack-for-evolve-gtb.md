Looking for someone who can build/sell me a  10s4p for my evolve GT bamboo. Specific cells aren't a deal breaker because I'm on a budget and would be best if the 11 pin connector was added. I could always solder it on after. 

Located in Canada (Montreal) but have an address in NY. 

Thanks!

We are located in Texas. 
We use Samsung 30q 
For the pack it’s 350$ 
Is this a battery replacement, intended to replace the current pack you have and continue using the bms/bldc controller and remote? 
Or a battery for a complete gut and rework?

Battery replacement. Intend on using the BMS. Probably will go with a riser or routing for the extra space.

We use a 3D printed riser to get the extra space needed. Can you remove the bms from the old battery and ship to us?  (or the old battery if you can’t remove the bms)  we will need it to test and charge the pack.

Yeah that's for sure possible, I bought the board second hand with a almost dead battery but haven't opened it up yet so I'll let you know asap. Is the riser included and  I'm guessing I'd have to cover the shipping of there and back?

Riser and shipping to you is covered in the 350$ if to your NY address. 
You only need pay shipping to us.  Ups ground is usually 18$

Awesome. I'll open the board up tomorrow and see what I can do. What's the turnaround time? Never know if I can get a ride in before the snow.

Now that is a service! How do you guys proceed for payment. I always do PayPal invoice just for security purposes. Does that work for you?

Heres my recently finished battery :)

very good quality, nice padding for the cells(feels sturdy and proper)

its just a little thick for the concavity of my deck but i guess that just means Im taking the belt sander to my spud!

That’s the only way we sell batteries. It allows us to purchase cells as needed and not sit on cells. Ensures fresh cells
I can work one up for you tonight and send it over. Once you pop the top and everything else checks out you can pay. 
We do have spare controllers and bms unit for evolve

It is padded well. I was wondering just how much of a dip that deck made. Must be soup bowl

@hyperIon1, I'm looking to rebuild my evolve bamboo gt in a couple months. I plan to use boostedbuilders dual focbox evolve heatsink and would like to use a 10s4p pack in the original enclosure. What material do you print the riser out of? Would I just ship you the BMS/charge port/switch or do you have ones available?
```

## \#22 Posted by: hyperIon1 Posted at: 2018-10-21T04:06:24.423Z Reads: 37

```
We just ordered 20 of those heatsinks. 
Really just the bms balance wires. But you can just ship the pack to us and we will dismantle it.

We have a table mounted tester. With duel motors and bldc controller so we can, test run with out having the board.  go through the settings and check battery info via remote
