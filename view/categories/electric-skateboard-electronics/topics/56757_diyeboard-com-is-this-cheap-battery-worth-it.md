So I have found a battery that is incredibly inexpensive From diyeboards 10s3p
(http://www.diyeboard.com/10s3p-samsung-lg-18650-lithium-battery-pack-p-631.html)
This simply seems too good to be true, should I go for it or should I get something more reliable like this.(https://www.mboards.co/products/10s3p-battery-complete-battery-solution)

Thanks for your time folks!
