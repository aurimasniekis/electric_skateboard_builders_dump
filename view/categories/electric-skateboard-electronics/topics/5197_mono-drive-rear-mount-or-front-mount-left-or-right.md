I'm about to build a mono-drive board. I'm not sure what's the better option. I'm like 200-210lbs (100kg), rides with right foot forward and won't be do much hilly rides. Please advise! :D

The best way is to mount it on the rear side doesn't matter

heel side usually feels way better as @Michaelinvegas said

@quanze most people chose heel-side to rear-mount a mono. I chose toe-side because I liked being about to see the motor while I'm riding. It seems to work fine; no complaints after about 160 miles.
