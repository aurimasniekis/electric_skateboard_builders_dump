Hey guys, I bought this BMS to try to figure to see if it will actually work. I see alot of people using BMS on their packs but i usually see their BMS having 11 wires while mine only has 10. I drew out a diagram , can someone check whether i'm doing this correctly or not.

Some BMS have only 10 some don't they are all different. Where did you get it from? For the balance connector just put the pins in in order of voltage (this is different with the positive and negative) yours probably doesn't have either a positive or a negative, one of the two.
