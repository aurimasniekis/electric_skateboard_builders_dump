I just have found it on Alibaba. Seems like FREERCHOBBY also started making Vescs. So for all chinese fans there is something new to try :slight_smile:

It IS a 1 on 1 copy of the VESC but without the USB port on it and a receiver lead soldered onto it.
Damn those copycats ! :mask:

IF vesc's start costing close to that wholesale number.. (60$ or so.) I think I might be jumping in for one quickly (if the quality and reviews are not terrible)

Strange thing: a lot of people wanting to buy the cheapest VESC possible regardless whether they are safe to drive or not. Fake components might not fail initially, but the can still fail after some hundred miles. 

So, on one hand wearing helmets, caring about personal safety and on the other hand not caring about the heart of your ebord which could make you SYF is sort of weird.

```
It is simple psychology: Nobody buys a product with the intention it will fail.
So the price of a VESC is only being compared to other manufacturers regardless any quality differences (it is ultimately the same product).
Also there is no statistical data telling us that the cheap chinese ones are any worse than the ones you have right now.
So you can't be sure about the SYF thing.

However I am on your side and do believe that it is a crucial part of any longboard and should not be taken too lightly. Time will tell how good the chinese VESCs actually are.

I had some experiences with Chinese ESCs for some time and also with the first batch of Enertion VESCs a year ago (made by Flier, not a small Chinese company either).  But we will see, VESC is not a plug and play device.

Ok, after reading for quite a while the other post about maytech vescs.. I got to the point..

If it is 20$ or so cheaper, does not offer warranty / assurance it works.. then this is quite a risky deal,.. better go with what you know and are confident in.. especially if you can get from the same country as yours.

You got me in full agreement here. We should be attempting to build the finest quality first. Performance is not just for fun. It's a safety thing. When you are cruising down the road at speed, you need to trust your machine to perform as expected. Otherwise, you are gambling with fate. LOL
Just recently I did a fuel injector replacement on a Toyota. The person purchased injectors off of ebay $169 for six, WOW. I installed them to spec and a week later there were all kinds of wonky problems and it threw misfire codes again!! So I got accused of doing a faulty install and yelled at. They looked EXACTLY like the OEM injectors. Even said, "ASRAM" on them. I removed the injectors and replaced them with legit OEM purchased from Autozone $435. BAM problem solved. I will never use cheap parts ever again. If a customer or friend wants me to install cheap parts, they can take a walk... Moral of story is, "You really get what you pay for". 
Buy VESC from respectable vendors and support this craft in a responsible way. These cheap parts that are only beginning to hit the market are going to do 2 negative things to our craft. 

1. Create a bad reputation for the VESC with failures and really an inadequate service and warranty program. Learn from the lessons Enertion and DIYelectricskateboards have taught us. Shit VESCs suck. Unless you can replace a DRV8302 effectively, you are definitely going to want to have some support. I've been waiting since FEB 14, for my DIY order.  WTF right? The VESC got shipped to DIY with the wrong capacitor. OOps...DUhhhh....I think last time it was the wrong USB port..What next, the Mosfets were replaced with jelly beans to save cost. LOL Does anyone see a pattern forming? Why would things be any different with these other Chinese VESC? Think about it...

2. Takes $$$ in sales away from the boutique quality builders that have been making this scene hot in the first place. It's not some kind of charity. These guys are working hard and smart to bring us the "Right" stuff.
So now because it's cheaper people are getting suckered in? If you can't afford the extra $$ to buy from a good vendor, then maybe ESK8 is not practical for you as a hobby. Some things just cost what they cost. 
To all who intend on taking the chance at these new entries into the VESC arena....Good luck...Seriously...
Rant....complete....LOL

Isn't it "OSRAM"? Sounds like your poor friend got ASsRAMmed, and got exactly what he paid for. Lol. 

Seriously though, it's kind of amazing (and sad) to see all the things that have actually gone wrong with mass VESC production even under the watch of our ESk8 vendors who are doing their best to get a quality and correctly built product. 

We should really be working on a @chaka cloning machine, and not betting our hard earned pennies playing cheap Chinese roulette with our faces.

If you buy a Honda because they're reliable cars and put after market parts in it, at some point, it ceases to be that reliable Honda you bought. 

Most of the time, you get what you pay for. There may be someone out there willing to sell you a VESC for less, but while it may look exactly the same, it rarely is. That goes for anything. You can buy Flywheel clones, fake Calibers, knock-off decks, and cheap bearings, but rarely do they stand up to the quality of the real deal. Sometimes having the best quality matters a lot, sometimes it doesn't. That extra $20 or even $100, you save by going with cheaper parts doesn't seem like such a good deal when something fails at 25mph.  

I totally agree with Ulfberht. May of these boutique builders put a lot of time in making sure their products are of the highest possible quality and flaws and problems still come up. These issues may cause delays and the time it takes to put together higher quality goods may cost more, but what would you rather have? Someone who makes sure that the product you put on your board is up to the highest level of quality control they can offer, or someone who simply wants to make a buck and doesn't care?

It's not really a matter of cheap vs. expensive. It's more a matter of quality and most of the time (not always), that comes with a price. I bought a higher end Taylor guitar. Build quality, service and many of the parts were sub-par. My cheaper Mexican and Chinese factory made guitars from reputable companies including Taylor, are of much higher quality. So it can work both ways, and while everyone can site exceptions, 9 times out of 10, quality comes in at a higher price.

Hey guys. New to the forum.

I am an Australian Engineer who worked in China  for a year in the EV industry. My role was mainly designing firmware and microcontroller boards for a multinational company. I can tell you that if there's one thing the Chinese have mastered, it is PCB palletisation technology, which means manufacturing electronics exactly like this one. 

You'd be surprised of the quality control practises employed by some Chinese companies these days, and I can tell you it is highly unlikely they're using knock-off MOSFETs or uCs - the most expensive components found in an ESC. If they're cutting costs, it would mainly be to do with the passive components such as the resistors, caps etc which would pose little to no risk. The greatest factor is the PCB layout, firmware and electronics design. In other words, if the VESC works like a charm in official production then you bet the Chinese can do it almost as well with less than half the price.

@Fundog - Nice to see more qualified people explaining the myth. People sometimes forget everything they make/buy is made in China. PCB's included..

China is capable of making anything and everything. I wouldn't underestimate them. Sure, some more than others... but that's the case for anything.

More so it's just people choosing the wrong companies to make their PCBs. I gotta admit though these VESCs in some of these photos look horrible.

I think some people fail to realize that Apple Products, Cisco Products are all made in China/Taiwan. Most USA companies outsource to China and sell within the USA as a USA made product. Don't get fooled thinking that Chinese products are inferior. They make both high quality and low quality.

The problem with China is not the quality of the product, but the quality of the Work, and most of the time they are hard to audit and don't respect IPC standard. AND don't mix product from TAIWAN AND CHINA, these two country are really different from production point of view.

China may have the ability to put out extremely high quality goods, but the level of QC when you buy directly from a Chinese manufacturer is not always par with others and you won't get much in terms of support. 

If you buy directly from China, you may do just fine and get a great quality VESC at a great price. On the other hand, if the VESC you get has any issues, you're kind of out of luck. Even the VESC's that are throughly vetted by reputable companies outside of China are subject to the same risks of product variation and failure.

Yea, I just wish it wasn't $165 :((  Only because when it comes time to switch I will have to get a 12s BMS (not high amp since mine is bypassed for charging)  as well as 2 more 3s batteries and a 12s dc charging brick

Albeit, I am keen to support a hobby that interests me and I prefer to help those who are pioneering good business practices being an owner myself.  With that in mind, i'll probably pick up one from him or one from enertion/likewise.

Regardless, when the time comes we will see what changes to the VESC have come about.  Im sure in 5 or more months these things will be cheaper, more reliable/efficient, and have many more functions.  Only time will tell I suppose.

Thanks for the suggestion

If you get the Enertion one you'll want to get platinum which comes out to about the same as chakas. You can go cheap and get it without the platinum, but I've seen a lot of blown drvs on VESCs. DIY may be a good option as well though I'm not sure how his warranty is for VESCs.

Solder bridges will cause a short circuit or it may cause intermediate voltages. Vanda uses IPC (Institute for Printed Circuits) 610 standard for our manufacturing processes. Here are some IPC standard for your reference.

Cool! Thanks for not directly advertising your VESC's!

Im sure you will ''earn'' our trust from this forum, especially with such quality and also the service to add the desired lenght cables and connectors! Thanks for showing comparison of these two Vesc's. Quality is on a way different level compared to china made, so there's probably a higher chance for china made vesc's to die or become faulty.

Karen are you with FreeRChobby? I bought my first pair of vesc through alibaba and they worked great for several months then one suddenly died. It seems that mine appear to be similar to your pictures for the china vesion. Many members are telling me several components are missing from the vesc. Please see my thread regarding the issue. Any insight on the missing components is greatly appreciated.

Hello Rafael, we are not with FreeRChobby. Our factory is located in Taipei Taiwan not China. If you order from Vanda, you will find a serial number on the PCB which will let us trace our production process through the source of components.

Does the shipping cost stays the same even if 5 vesc's are ordered? Then it might not be a that bad deal.. I assume it is a stock shipping fee for the courier service and the weight is not that limited.. especially for a component which weights max 200g.. right?

not to go off topic, but he definitely developed the design from the beginning, and it was the Chinese factories that took his design and reproduced it with no credit and cheaper versions- not the other way around as you suggested.

Yes the Vanda VESC can be used with FOC mode. We have used FOC mode for around the last 6 months on our test skateboards with both hub motors and belt drive.  It is important as always to carefully configure you VESC.

HOBBYKING ESC can run in foc (proven in one of the topic)  and your company made business with them, in your test vid, hope your esc can run 13-14s in 190-200kv motors and exceeding erpm limit (60k) without error or breaking.

Actually thats pretty cool to get a video of a 14s setup so quick!

The problem is, we run the vesc on boards with much more load than here on a light heli propellor.
If you put 14s on a board and run that with 4.12 hardware you get voltage spikes, especially from braking down a hill. These spikes exceed 60V fast and kill your vesc.
You have to leave some headroom for the 60V components, that´s why you should do 12s at max on board.
Some are even ok with 13s but you have to pay attention to a few factors.

Sweet spot for vesc (Volt and Ampere) is on 10s for eboards.

That would be great if this $90 flipsky VESC could run it!  That would enable a 4WD build to be much cheaper!

Yeah.. If 2 FOCBOX's are like, what $300... I bet it's between $250-$275ish...  If it was low $200's that would be very appealing.  If these $90-$100 v4.12 VESC's turn out to be solid and run FOC, then it'd be a tough choice I think..

It is impressively small though.  In that last pic it looks like the size of an iPhone 6.

Take it from those with experience. They will vibrate loose if you are only using solder, unless the fit with the case is very precise.

There have already been similar designs where capacitors are essentially only supported by solder and not a combination of solder and PCB running across the cap + glue. Designs without additional support suffer from caps vibrating loose over time.

Not saying this to bash your product, hope you'll reconsider the design. Reliability is important, our lives depend on part on the electronics we use.

There you go. Follow the crumbs. Besides current vesc6 based escs, it also happens with the Chinese eBay esc. Stewii fixed it with hit glue, personally a bigger fan of how the focbox solves the issue. The caps are supported by the PCB.

If its just the caps that could possibly come loose I'll get the cheap vesc and do the hot glue myself.  
What about Vanda Electronics?  or any other?  isnt' there a Chinese manufacturer (cheap) that's doing the upgrades from the 4.12?  I don't know what they are but a couple doubled caps and stuff and supposedly more reliable in foc.   Are companies cheaping out?  I thought through the last years with trial and error it was realized how to make the 4.12 reliable.  Aren't any companies doing it?

this flysky vesc looks nice.  I mean I like the plug (wouldnt know what else to look for).   @JohnnyMeduse you work for another place and are maybe biased but it seems everyone who knows about these things work for enertion but what do you think of the state of vescs out of china these days?  anything look promising?

I haven't done much testing to make sure but it seems the focbox makes the motors run quieter than a set of older 4.12 vescs.   does that make sense?

If I read that data sheet correctly, it means FET's are rates for 150A at 25C and 120A at 100C. But they also dissipate 110 W power at 150A, as far as I know thats a lot of heat and needs a beefy heatsink, maybe even a fan. But I doubt anyone would need 150A from a single VESC. At 100A power dissipated in only 50W which is not that bad. 
So a good heatsink paired with this ESC should be able do 100A continuous.

Well I had a long discussion with Barbie Zhang from FlipSky last night and have some interesting news to share.

First I'll post the pictures she sent.  These are of their VESC 6 in a model plastic case, which will be a waterproof aluminum one when released, and they should have pictures of that by May 20th.

![Screenshot_20180518-075237|690x477](upload://lvZDOpkghclgRoQnWSDCGLgDI1O.jpg)

I'm a bit confused about the dimensions of the case.  I was told it is 100mm x 92mm, which given the size the ESC that seems rather large in comparison.  Regardless, that's the info thus far. 

I sure hope someone who's good at testing these is able to get a hold of one so we can know if they're reliable or not.  They said they've been running beta testing since the beginning of April.  These tests include: continuous current, continuous peak, current peak, temperature rise, etc...   Well that's all the news I have regarding this, hope it helps! :slight_smile:

P.S. From technical perspective those mosfets are not even good for 60A focbox/vesc6 uses direct fet which are rated for over 300A ea and still struggle at 60A currents, this is 150A capacity so it means at 100A they will be burning open fire so maximum is like 60A not even constant cause the case is really bad at dissipating heat. Chinease ESC uses those mosfets but like in 5-6 in parallel for 80A currents :D

I don't really get your message ;) 

All ESCs have mosfets, all mosfets have some Rdson and all correspond to the law P=I² x R ;)
So you will have some heat on every ESC, just depends how you handle it ;) . 
And if you look at that (from [here](https://www.mouser.de/datasheet/2/196/irf7749l1pbf-1228055.pdf)):

and that: 
![IDTemp|378x296](upload://4pjYiZe4dEnqEsdD9QFeSqf3qpr.png)
it is no wonder that you can't do high loads cont. if you don't get away heat.
I don't really think that 36 Fet design has really some better Rdson, just the losses splitted over some more space...

Depends on how to mount them and how waterproof they really are. The screws in the case seem to be only for the big and small closing lid, so i don't know how to attach them anywhere (without drilling into the waterproof case). 
And waterproof means at least IP67 (for me), everything else is waterresistant and can also be done by simple spraying. 

All in all, maximum 3, worst case 0.

just read threw the whole site. there is some interesting stuff going on there:
> 1.Power advantage:
> we added an anti-spark switch to the front of the power supply to allow a maximum current to pass up to 300A. Also, it’s more convenient to use.

not shure about that but hey thats just my 2 cents

>Meanwhile, C37 ,C39 ,C41,C40,C43,C44 were all replaced by 10uF 100V

all good VESC producer do that for years -> ollin, esk8.de

>7.Optimization of PCB layout and process
1). The PCB adopts a gold-thickening process with a 6-layer PCB layout design. The thickness of each layer of copper foil is 3OZ, and the total copper foil thickness is 3OZ*6=18OZ. 

could explain why this board is such big -> they cant produce small traces with a 3OC metal layer, but I doubt that they are really using that on all layer! probalby only on the outer 2 Layers

>6.Optimization of Mosfet
12 Power MOSFETs NTMFS5C628NL is specially processed on heat dissipation and over-current to achieve continuous 80A output and more stable performance.

what´s true? 80A continous or 60A? i am shure that this gernerates some smoked fsesc

> 2). PCB size layout is more convenient to use. We integrated the XT60, XT90, bullet connectors 4.0 and so on, making the overall looks more beautiful. 

why a XT60 and XT90? the desing looks like XT90. but hey, the 4mm bullet connectors are okey


just my thoughts about that side.

I now understand why it states that it can do 60-80A. It can do that at lowest voltage ~21V which is 1400W I highly doubt it could do it at 60V. As they don't mention wattage and only current :D

[quote="fuelre, post:210, topic:5207"]
1.Power advantage:

we added an anti-spark switch to the front of the power supply to allow a maximum current to pass up to 300A. Also, it’s more convenient to use.
[/quote]

300A with that case is like a joke :D Our solid bar of aluminum is hot at 150A so I would like to see it even do 100A but of course, at low voltage, it's not big wattage 20 * 150A is 3kW same as 60A at 50V :D

Why are you talking about input voltage in regards to FETs heating? The throughput wattage doesnt matter for heat generated. All that matters is voltage drop across fets and current through them during. This will be a function only of current and FET on resistance not voltage. 

If a fet is 60v rated it will do the same max amps at 20V as it would at 60V. The whole point of higher voltage batteries is more wattage through the board without extra heat.

Like they released BLDC-Tool / Firmware (running inside shipped focboxes) source code? :joy:

The GNU GPL demands that as soon as you distribute GPL licensed software in executable format you make available the "complete corresponding source code". The GNU GPL also contains a definition of this term:

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.

You are welcome to continue throwing negativity while we focus on creating an awesome product that is going to improve the eskate experience while reducing cost and giving back to the community. This entire focus on focbox firmware open-sourcing is little more than a smear campaign, the firmware is unchanged from existing open-source repositories. The point of open sourcing is to make updated/improved code available to the community for integration in other projects,  the focbox code is already available in open source repositories. The unity firmware which I am developing will contain many new and interesting tidbits which, as the license requires, will be open sourced. To do anything else would violate the spirit of open source license. It is my sincere hope that my work will be used to improve other vesc-inspired designs. 

Back to the topic of this thread, it is good for people to acknowledge when they make incorrect statements to clear up the information for other readers. You do aclnowledge that whether the input voltage is 20v or 60v makes no difference on the driving current which is possible? If a vesc is rated to 80 amps it doesnt matter what input voltage within its usable range you test at. It is my understanding that rating remains pretty much constant. If anything I believe lower input voltage probably reduces the current rating. More fet on-time when driving the motor to achieve given amps.

It will be hard to get the improved source codes unless Enertion makes a github page detailing the changes and posting it. From past post it will be unlikely unless they no longer have a need to profit off of it will it become open source.

Well personally I'm skeptical because of all the access points it has from the xt90, the on /off button, the cables, and the at the center of the top it's got that removable bit for accessing the plug-ins... So I wouldn't call it waterproof, but it seems at least pretty water resistant as long as all these are sealed and closed.

I added some more photos to my post above as they added some to their site.

Listed dimensions are 100×92.5x22 mm I  think. For a dual motor drive thats a lot of real estate eaten up. For reference a focbox is somewhere around 60×65×25 mm (estimate). The unity dual motor driver we are making is roughly 110x70x20 mm and saves you some extra wiring space. Not sure of original vesc 6 dimensions?

Just googled a regular skate deck is about 8" or 200mm wide. So a bit extra with a longboard deck probably. It might fit side by side but It wouldn't be low profile once you add in a case etc and consider deck curvature as you move out from centerline. Suppose you might have to stack them vertically for a better fit.

@moderators anyway this discussion  can be split from this thread... it’s not that relevant. It’s the end all debate upon whom has sovereignty over whom.



Edit: PS. @mmaner I’m with you bro, if we can’t recognize Taiwan then none of the former SU satellites deserve sovereignty either , or hell , everything should belong to Mongolia 🤷🏽‍♂️. But nonetheless  the sovereignty (which that do cough cough) or non-sovereignty of Taiwan’s has nothing to do with VESC

It's drenched in this white silicone for the water proofing, so I can't really get it out of the case yet.

So update on the FlipSky ESC So far... Not good.
1) They do not come with a bootloader... easily fixed with VESC Tool

2) Doesn't actually work. All the setup goes through fine, I can run motor detection and see the controller effecting the duty cycle but no actually spinning on the motor... Really weird, never seen an issue like this before.
Out of the 5 I got, 2 have this issue, 1 seems to be working fine, the last 2 I still haven't tested. (Got pretty busy and annoyed with the first two...)
I'll be reaching out today too see what's going on with these two so far. Will also try to make and post a video sometime of what's going on... I don't feel like I'm explaining it well.

3) @Deodand So far HM-10 does fit inside the case and works on the 10 ft away... I'll walk away further next time :slight_smile:

Yes, they are friggin' massive, the case feels solid in the hand and fits together really well. I will have a play with a receiver and BT module tomorrow and see what I can fit inside. 

Same insides as @oriol360 with the white goo every where but hey, I will deal with that if they make a dual case. 

Plugged a 4S lipo and the vesc tool and both have FW 3.37 installed, bootloader etc. One problem, I can't update the FW's using the VESC tool or Ackmaniac's tool. Uploads all good, but shows the same FW when it re-boots. 

That's as far as I have gotten. I need to go to bed but I will solder some bullets on the then and see if I can get though the setup tomorrow afterwork.

Little update. FW's updated fine, got bullets on the ends. Just need to replace the ones on my motors (different size) and detect the motors and finish setting up the ESC's. I will update once that is done but unfortunalty the boss has banned me from riding until Sunday so I will have to wait until then to have a test ride.

@JohnnyMeduse @EssEnn So it seems the sensor plug on these VESC is backwards. I was told this will be fixed for future batches... So for the current batch you have to swap you sensor wires around:
![FlipSky%20sensor%20fix|554x306](upload://yrv9olU5WOCkQtK3GqBKLobQmlv.jpg)

I did this and it's working fine now... Kinda annoying but, for now at least it's working and I don't have dead ESC's as I previously thought..
I'll finish setting up my board tonight with these, and take them for a ride tomorrow on BLDC. If all is well I'll swap over to FOC and then Dual setups..

Well i got some time this afternoon to mess about with bullet connectors etc. Im just hashing something together with what I currently have on my Trampa. 

Long story short, I just went FOC right away. Motor detected fine first attempt, no issues (I've got SK3 190Kv motors running 8S, no sensors, split PPM) for both ESC's. 

My issue is my original loom needs adjusting by quite a bit so I can mount them. Then I am going to velcro and cable tie them to my deck. I should be able to get it done late tonight and if the weather is good enough tomorrow I will have a test ride. 

OH, BT modules, got to sort them out as well. 

Only issue is the size of the cases and no light for either of the power switches.

I ran conservative settings on both FSESC's, 60A/-60A Motor and 30A/-10A battery as I wanted to give it a bit of a shake down. The Lipo's are back on charge and I will go for another ride this evening and if I get time I will have a look at the BT module that failed.

So far so good. No issues with the FSESC 6.6's. The BT module did not die so I think although they work from inside the cases range is an issue. No biggie, I will mount them outside at some point in the future. 

For context, the first test was on rough grass, 4-5 inches tall, bumpy so everything was rattling like mad. My latest ride was on grass but a lot shorter and a lot less bumpy. 

Log of latest ride - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qC322XoVwOUZWUS0daiSF-aIRXbD9S5h

I'm back to work tomorrow but I will have another ride after work and up the amps but looking at the telemetry things are looking good. Temps are stable and below 40C for the first ride but it was a lot cooler this evening and I hit max 33C. 

@oriol360 How are your's going?

Been going great actually. 
The remote receiver fits inside the enclosure of the Master ESC and there is no drop or cut off.
The BT Module fits inside the Slave ESC and also no cut off or drops from what I can tell.

FOC is Crazy silent at all speeds..... on 4.12 HW going faster than 15mph there would be no difference in sound. 

I'll be testing the up/downhill performance tomorrow in my Parking garage as I have no hills near me...

Currently my issue is with the size.... The enclosure is just too large for dual setups..

Dude, that's dangerous, the full current of the FSESC that you didn't turn on is running THROUGH YOUR SPLIT PPM WIRE. 
The on/off switch is a low side switch, the split ppm wire connects the grounds of the two FSESCs together. When one switches on, the other one now has a path to ground though the PPM wire.
Disconnect one of the ground wires on your split PPM cable.
MAKE SURE YOU SWITCH BOTH OF THEM ON OTHERWISE YOU'LL BLOW UP YOUR PPM CABLE.

This is why you don't f***ing implement a low side switch for this sort of application.
IMO, looking at the board they had plenty of space to add something like an LTC7000 to do high side switching with the 3 N-channel MOSFETs.

Alright, so I went to the hilliest place I know near me... This was with a dual hubmotor build on FOC.
These thing help up very strong! 
Did go from 100-70% in about 3miles in 20minutes so range went down a bit given the terrain. 
Temp went from 100 F to 115 F... It was about 105 F outside..
This isn't my normal test ride since I don't really go there too often. So this test is pretty limited, I can't exactly put hundreds of miles in this place in a reasonable amount of time. However from what I experienced today I believe these ESCs are very good right now.
I'll keep them on FOC and use as my main ESCs for right now.

No, you must disconnect the negative wire on one of them.
The negative wire is what connects the grounds of the ESCs together.
If you leave both of them attached then you must make sure both ESCs are physically switched on before you use them. If only one is switched on, then the other "thinks" it is on because it sees ground through the negative wire of the PPM cable. 
What the on/off switches on these ESCs do is it connects and disconnects the ESC from the negative terminal on the XT90 connector. What your PPM cable is essentially doing is bypassing this through the negative wires.

There are two ways you can do this, BEC or (Ideal) ORing Diodes.

A BEC hooked up to your battery will do the job just fine. Connecting this to your receiver means you only need to connect the signal wires to the ESCs. It'll be the simplest and easiest solution so I recommend this.

If you don't want to get a BEC, the other solution is a little more tricky. 
You need either a pair of Ideal Diode ICs or 
a pair of Shottky Diodes with a very low forward voltage drop.
Normal diodes would be much simpler and easier to wire up
Something like this
https://www.arrow.com/en/products/sbr12a45sd1-t-01/diodes-incorporated
looks like it will do the job. (Forward drop of ~300mV at 1A).
What you need to do is splice the POSITIVE 5V wires and solder these shottky diodes IN SERIES, with the cathode POINTING AWAY from the ESC. So this means each ESC will have a shottky diode pointing away from it on the 5V wire, before they both meet at the PPM splitter.
It will look something like this

ESC#1 +5V -----------|>|-----------Splitter
ESC#2 +5V -----------|>|-----------Splitter

Splitter -------------------------------Receiver/

Both options are perfectly safe done correctly. (The latter is employed in automotive and industrial applications. It is called Redundant Power Supplies.) 

Honestly, it is a huge oversight that the VESC and its derivatives don't already employ ORing diodes on their 5V outputs when it was expected that many people would be using more than one.
Grr, makes me want to develop my own ESC that fixes all the hardware problems/oversights present on the VESC and its derivatives. :angry:

That is where this forum is split. Those who are EE majors and those who are educated hobbyiest. I haven't heard of an ORing diode configuration until you said so. I tried on mine to add a TVS diode to places not original in the VESC 6.4 schematic. It's probably two more layout changes before I finally call my derivative done.

Forgive my ignorance, but can someone tell me about the built in anti spark.  If you leave the switch off, can you just connect your Vedder switch in place of the Flipsky built in AS.  Or can you leave it on, and still connect the vedder switch with your 60amp fuse to this ESC?

You can leave it on and use the vedder switch and fuse to turn on and off.

It is basically having 2 antisparks in series. Both have to be on for the ESC to turn on

So of the three wires comming from the ppm cable, is the servo wire comming from the MCU or the 5V rail more likely to be affected by a random transient? There was a warning posted about using Y-splitter for the ppm and resulting in destruction of the MCU but I could not figue out which line to put the diode on on my version.

Yes, each ESC needs a diode pointing towards it on the negative line.

It will look something like this
ESC#1 GND ------------|<|---------Splitter
ESC#2 GND ------------|<|---------Splitter
Splitter-------------------------------Receiver GND.

You may get a bit of distortion on your PPM signal, so be sure to tune their input configurations accordingly.

[/quote]

I would think the PPM signal is more susceptible to transients, but there is a resistor in series with the signal and the GPIO on the STM32F405RG, which (in combination with the GPIO's clamping diodes) should protect it from EMI or transients generated by the receiver. Or if you accidentally configure it as an output, the resistor should limit the current flowing in and out of the GPIO. Is it the MCU that explodes or the DRV8302 that explodes? Because only the signal wire is connected to the MCU, +5V comes off the DRV8302, and GND is connected to Digital GND of the ESC. 
I can see why the DRV8302 might explode if the 5V lines are connected together WITHOUT ORing diodes, because if one of them goes into fault, it'll start sinking current from the other DRV8302's buck converter and cause both of them to fail. 

I'm pretty sure you need to put the diode here. ![OringDiode|634x500](upload://1CzTFzgyoMvUEBLzMxujlEYtbt5.png)

Between the output capacitor and the feedback resistors, the cathode of the diode goes to +5V.

However, if your VESC variant does not have those resistors in place, then it is the signal wires that causes the MCU to blow up.

Now that think more about it, even with the diodes in place, things might still go wrong and the STM32F405RG might blow up through the signal wires.

I would recommend turning both ESCs on before plugging in any shared wires.

I would feel really bad if the $10 MCU blew up on one of your ESCs.

I understand the CAN-Bus issue requires the same process ... power up both, then plug in the CAN cable.

The elephant in the room is that you shouldn't be able to 'fry' a VESC (or any other motor controller) by doing what they are designed to do ... which is connecting 2 or more of them among other things. 

As far as I understand, even if you follow this process Maytech recommend a 'CAN filter' component between the VESCs.

Got my 6.6 today. They scrapped the on/off switch for this batch hence the rubber plug.  Check out the solder blob on the middle cap. And theres one directly on the DRV too arghhh. 

Testing faired better. This ESC seems pretty tough. I was probably a bit hasty upping current limits in foc and had sensorless loss of rotor position at 120A phase a few times. After more tuning I've done a few dozen full throttle launches at 4kw. This is with 12s 100A battery and 150A phase.

CANH / CANL is the signal carriage to differentiate 1 and 0 from what I can understand. They don't have the ground wire attached. I don't know why, but I do recall reading somewhere on the forums this is correct in some (all?) circumstances. 

According to Maytech, it protects your CAN-Bus from getting fried ... which is supposed not to be an issue any more, but still is according to them with higher voltages.

That's all I know .. maybe more than I know :slight_smile:

Ah bugger.

I also decided to try out CAN instead of split PPM. I reconfigured both ESC's and everything was working but when I tried to check via Ackmaniac's App, no BT module seen. No lights on the module. Try a second module, same thing. Connected the one at a time to an Adruino Uno  and bang, powers up, lights on and I can connect to it. Both these modules used to be connected each to an FSESC and worked fine before. 

I have been speaking with them about the split PPM issue and powering up both ESC's. Just need clarification on some thing they want me to try.See what they say about the UART port as well.

Hi All,

As promised, data from testing two FlipSky v6.6 ESCs ... 

ambient temperature in test room - between 22 and 25 degrees c
airflow - nil
cooling - case with heatsink only
constant input - 48v / 30a (conditioned power)
test load - 48v (1.5kW) BLDC sensored motor
duration of 30 amp test - 37 minutes
maximum temperature ESC 1 - 63.2 degrees c
maximum temperature ESC 2 - 68.4 degrees c

Immediately prior to this we'd done 1 hour at 15 amps AND 36 minutes at 25 amps. So total test time was well over 2 hours. The testing was contiguous. This is the reason the graph starts at 50 degrees c.

![flipskydata25062018|690x342](upload://oMYJfBxSjY6UQxSwExgTmA7HhfD.jpg)

This is a huge step up from the VESC 4.12 even with a heatsink. We are really impressed.

I can see there may be a few component issues based on @district9prawn experience, but in our testing of constant throughput of over 1200w it was really impressive.

FlipSky seem to be on the right track. We've found them responsive and they appear competent and willing to take feedback and incorporate it. 

They also seem prepared to sell them at a reasonable price, so if you can help them it may well just help everyone.

Seems to me that they are close to getting this sorted and they can mass  produce.

Worth supporting with feedback / input and may end up a good commercial option.

Cheers

I went for a ride yesterday after work along some mountain bike trails etc. Here is the log of my ride - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ccv4J5gTz9E-4b-9FYA0GsTlYhx3sx1K

Almost an hour long ride with short breaks during a hot evening +26c ambient. 80/-80 motor 40/-10 battery running sensorless FOC. As you can see I was not able to push the ESC's due to the terrain but the ESC's survived the constant rattling and worked flawlessly.

Flipsky have been in communication with me about the spilt PPM issue, I have a few things to try tonight and will report back. 

Overall I'm happy with how these ESC's have performed so far. Time will tell with regards to overall reliability. I quickly designed & printed a bracket to mount the ESC's on top of each other
 ![IMG-20180623-WA0009|345x194](upload://8y9AHlXwecJShNEtWuayqhVOxET.jpeg) 

It's going to get a total redesign with a BT module holder integrated on the side, a bottom bracket screwed to the old nowind MAX6 mount and then I will try to figure out a way to clamp the top ESC down to the bottom ESC (right now I'm just using cable ties).

It is currently like this - 
![IMG-20180625-WA0000|345x194](upload://c8IVvidUAo7kCMu3hp8djY1umzM.jpeg)

The mosfets are NVMFS5C604NL. They have half the rdson as the stock ones. So low now that with drv8301 overcurrent at lowest setting, current is reported as 50-60A when tripped :joy:

The drv death was pretty unremarkable. I had the esc in trap mode and gave it full throttle. Motor cut out and esc threw drv error. 

140A phase seems to be the limit for how far I can push. Setting higher in sensorless foc causes the rotor position to be lost at full throttle. I don't think it is saturation as I have an identical motor with higher turn count that also has the same problem at the same current setting.
```

I just want to point out that Rdson isn't the only electrical characteristic of MOSFETs that generates losses.

The stock MOSFETs also have less than half the gate switching charge, which means less than half the switching losses.
The NTMFS5C628NL has 10nC of switching charge, the NVMFS5C604NL has ~25 nC of switching charge, resulting in a total of 40nC and 100nC respectively).
With four in parallel on a 44V system at a switching frequency of 25kHz, Switching losses dominate until around 40A with the NTMFS5C628NL with a power dissipation of 1W (total dissipation 2W), with the NVMFS5C604NL, switching losses dominate... well, always (150A). The formula for calculating switching losses is (GC * SW * Vcc* I)/Igs where GC is Gate Switching Charge (Gate Drain Charge plus Gate Source Charge minus Gate Threshold Charge), SW is switching frequency, Vcc is system voltage, I is current, and Igs is gate drive current.  

For reference, the stock MOSFETs have a total dissipation of 1.8 W at 40A, while the NVMFS5C628NL (four in parallel) have a total dissipation of 3W at 40A (most of that is from switching losses). Both at 25 kHz switching frequency. MOSFETs have this attribute called "FOM or Figure of Merit", which is switching charge times Rdson. When paralleling MOSFETs, this becomes very important, as in this case, where there are four in parallel on each phase (well, two on the top and bottom). Switching loses affect both sides of the half-bridge since both the top and bottom need to turn on and off, whereas conduction losses only affect one side of the half-bridge at a time.
In fact, in switched mode power supplies, switching losses is the main source of power loss, not conduction losses, so Rdson becomes even less relevant in those applications.
Trying to exclusively minimize Rdson in a switching application is like trying to overclock a CPU while reducing SDRAM read/write speed. 

Gate switching charge is what makes Internal Rectifier's high performance MOSFETs such trash when compared to any other MOSFET in that performance range. They literally have sometimes up to 4 times the switching charge as a MOSFET from a different manufacturer with the same Rdson. Compare IRFS7530 with IPB014N06. (The latter is also cheaper too). (Well, Technically Infineon owns IR now, but optimos and IRFET are different technologies. The IRFETs released under Infineon are getting better with the switching charge, but are still inferior when compared to the competition).


Has anyone here checked out the ODrive? it's another Open Source ESC that can drive up to two motors and an auxiliary DC motor. It works with (relatively cheap) shaft encoders to provide a cheap but powerful servo solution with BLDC motors.
https://odriverobotics.com/
The 48V variant costs $149. 
I would get one myself, but I can't really install shaft encoders on 8" hub motors, maybe it can be rigged to run without encoders.

@district9prawn They've got some additional detail now on their website which outlines the changes they've made and some key components. I had a message from them and they'll be changing their MOSFETs based on your suggestions and testing... like I said, looks like they want to get this to work. https://flipsky.net/products/flipsky-fsesc-6-6-based-upon-vesc%C2%AE-6-heat-sink?variant=8739261743164 ... and they definitely appear to have some engineering ability at the hardware level which is refreshing as most of the Chinese VESC derivative (and copy) suppliers we've dealt with seem not to ... 

If I can just soapbox for 1 minute ... 

<begin rant> there is an incredibly high level of electronics design skill on this forum and tons of experience. If these people on this forum can help FlipSky make this product bullet proof, this is the chance to finally stop the bins full of dead VESCs that are posted here as a badge of honour. They aren't; they are a complete waste of money if they don't work, but awesome value if they were commercial quality motor controllers. A high spec ebike controller with bluetooth is $50 ... the bar is high. 

Mostly, the group buys rely on one person's design with no ability to do much 'looping' to incorporate changes. Understandable of course as you aren't dealing with a company, but not ideal. More power to them, but it's not the path to mass production and eventually lost cost, reliable, robust e-skate (and other stuff) for all. Then the various e-skate suppliers on here could just focus on making the best boards and know the controllers aren't going to fail. So could all the builders ... 

FlipSky happen to be the ones we've found most willing to assist and they seem willing to incorporate suggestions / feedback and take real world data and use it to make the product better. We don't ultimately care who does it, but if FlipSky ends up being the ones to bring bullet proof ESCs to the world with VESC lineage then we certainly won't be complaining and we're doing what we can to help. We just need reliable product at a reasonable price. Right now, it's not.

disclosure: We are looking at FlipSky as a potential supplier. We have not made a decision yet but hope their ESC can meet our requirements. The no.1 issue for us currently is reliability ... it cannot fail and you don't have to look far through these forums to find them still failing. We are trying to get their ESC to work in our product/s and hope that it can be sorted in time for us to use it. Our feedback and testing is also looping back into the project through FlipSky. We've found them to be responsive and willing to undertake continuous improvement.  

The collective experience and knowledge of a subset of users on these forums could fix the VESC derivative issues ... if they want to. This isn't supposed to be an electronics hardware design forum as far as I can understand as it's over the head of most of the users. 

There's a huge amount of time dedicated to hardware design and re-design because of continued failures. It's been years since BV released the first designs and the improvements on the v4.12. It seems like a good time to stop continually looping through the hardware design and get it rock solid. Sure the firmware and software improvements/iterations and accessories (like @rpasichnyk 's work) should continue and will but it has to be on the back of hardware that does not fail any more. It's got to be smart enough to 'trip' before it fails. <end rant>

So, if you think this is all reasonable, get behind them, get in touch, give them feedback and suggestions ... and help stop the dead VESC problem.  Help them make their VESC bullet proof. At least that'd be one commercially available at a reasonable price that doesn't fail.

It's time to move up a layer so the hardware does not fail and it's all about firmware and software.

Cheers

From what I've seen, most dead VESCs are the result of a blown DRV83xx chip. (I haven't seen any using the newer generation DRV832x though). And unfortunately, many of these users don't have (access to) the expertise to replace the chip (especially since the PCB doesn't have the exposed ground pad on both layers!! This essentially forces you to use some form of hot air, otherwise it could be done with a soldering iron and patience). This is a highly sophisticated MOSFET gate driver IC that has a lot of things on it that can go wrong, from the bootstrap supply, to charge pump, to the buck converter.
The reason for this is because of a few hardware oversights in the VESC's original design, namely, NO TRANSIENT SUPPRESSION. I've seen time and time again in application notes, even ones from Texas Instruments themselves, recommending RC snubbers (in this exact application--motor control, high voltage) be placed very close to the switch nodes, wide and direct gate drive routing, and high side node clamp to clamp negative transients. On both the VESC 4 and VESC 6, the MOSFETs are a significant distance away, with very little in terms of transient suppression. It doesn't help that the MOSFETs on the VESCs are the (very) inferior ones from International Rectifier that have insane Miller Charge and terrible input capacitance values. We are running these chips very close to their Absolute Maximum Ratings, and from what I can tell, not much is done to accommodate for that. And as we saw in the discussion earlier, the 5V regulated output doesn't incorporate an ORing diode, which can cause some users to accidentally blow up their VESCs when using more than one (it also doesn't help that these "anti-spark" switches are low side switches either). I've dealt with the problem of exploding gate drivers myself using less sophisticated ICs (mic4605, a piece of junk; adp3120) where the bootstrap driver blows up because of unsuppressed transients (both drivers are 1A drivers and I used very low gate charge MOSFETs, this resulted in very large slew rates on a less than ideal prototype board). The only MOSFET driver that didn't quickly fail on me was the A4960 from Allegro Microsystems. (It still works, although I might have broken some SPI registers).

One of the big issues for hardware design is that the e-skateboard community demands a very small form factor, something that the $50 ebike controller severely lacks. This forces design decisions such as omitting hardware additions that are deemed "less than necessary" (the RC snubbers and transient suppression, filters on the voltage dividers, ORing diodes, etc.) and the use of a highly integrated driver such as a DRV83xx chip in favor of a more rugged design using separate ICs. The DRV83xx is a great chipset, just not when you run it close to its Absolute Maximum Ratings without any hardware accommodations.

I am no solder expert either. But to me it looks like they have too much solder, they are not as shiny (hard to see on pictures), and some of them I needed to pull to check that they would not fall off, as it looked like they could be cold joints.

Hi,Mikaelj. The FSESC 4.12 is thickened with tin on the board during PCB produce, which makes the product's over-current and heat-dissipating ability stronger and the performance is more stable.

You can never have too much solder on power traces (as long as they don't bridge and short to other parts of the board).

It's either some of that lead-free garbage or cheap chinese solder, I'm guessing the former since FLIPSKY is probably is trying to stay RoHS compliant.

It's a "cold joint", the wires were soldered on without heating up the rest of the pad (ie the transistors), not the best but it should hold. If the pads were heated properly during soldering, the solder joint should smoothly fillet from the wires to the pad. I went through and extra-tinned the power traces on my VESCs. 
The TB VESC also has this problem but to a lesser extent.

I want to thank you all for documenting your trial/error/reviews on the FSESC 6.6, really helpful to a noob like me. The big appeal here over a vesc/focbox for me, who thinks loop keys are primitive and doesn't have an e-switch battery/bms, is the option of having a power switch, presuming they are more reliable than a DIY anti-spark switch on a vesc (which I hear blow easily). Maybe I'm missing something but it seems kind of ridiculous that out of the all the other advantages, the power switch is the clincher for me. Anyways, assuming the 6.6 will be reliable, it definitely looks worth the cost. Keeping posted!

I have just purchased 2 FSESC6, as a customer I would like to feedback that you Estore is well designed, there’s even a message applet. But what’s the point of having that and when I send it through email and I never gets a response?
As I bought 2 of your FSESC6’s and intends to use it as dual, i emailed to enquire if there Is any can bus cable comes with it but no response. 
You do sell them but only in bulk of 10’s?? I’m a user not a reseller, why do I need to buy 10?? So, if a customer were to buy 2 of the ecs’s, won’t it be cool to just throw in a can bus connector? Maybe that’s your practice but I’m a first time customer, replying emails will be very much appreciated and will gain your business reputation and reliability on after sales confidence. That’s my 2 cents and oh by the way, that was not my only email, I’ve sent before prior to my purchase and still I have not heard from you guys.

Actually I'm positive they don't use their own VESC's, which yes, I find to be quite odd given how much they're promoting them.

So how do I know this.  Well I went through every single boards details and not one of them mentioned their speed controller, except for their cheapest one, which had this picture in the details. 

![Screenshot_20180802-220205_Chrome|281x500](upload://eKJ6Mr15JNxK1YvhwwP4K6y6y21.jpg)

Seems like if they wanted to really promote these boards, they'd at least offer the option to upgrade to one.  Hell, even the cheapest one should be offered as an option to get people real world use of these and in turn maybe some good reviews about how their VESC's really make the ride better or something...  Lol, I dunno, I just think that's really odd.  Also, if they're using these cheap ESC's, why not also offer them for sale?

No, I intend to though.  I'm not bad mouthing them or anything, and if it comes across that way that's not my intention.  I just think for a company that is really going all in on their VESC's marketing, especially for the Esk8 community, it's rather odd that they don't run any of their VESC's, or even offer an upgrade option.  That's all.  Not saying their boards aren't good or their VESC's aren't good.  I've heard great things about their VESC's actually and intend on getting at least a few, probably four for a AWD setup.  I think it's pretty awesome that flipsky has asked our opinions on things regarding their VESC's and they've actually implemented some things, so they definitely listen to their customers which is awesome!    One of the reasons I'll be buying a bunch :slight_smile:

[/quote]

Oh. good question. Thats have a positive dynamic in russia. Community is not so big, i can talk we a first generation now in ESk8. But, people have big interest for electric skateboard. But esk8 lose to electric scooters. 

We have a only 1-3 DIY board project based on trampa board in russia. Don't have many big and good project. One of the reason - its money currency. We have some political problem, and sanction )) And for  many ppl thats idea looks so expensive)
but any way, we have guys who made good esk8 without big budget)  Chinese ESC  (like a meepo esc) so popular in russia) That product good way for growth ESK8 community in my country) 
I some times meets ppl who have esk8 from BB,Evolve but its so rare riders)

@BarbaraZ 76x44x19 is only slightly bigger than your single 4.12? It hardly seems doable, do you have any images of the new dual?

Also, will it have integrated antispark/switch as per the dual 6.6? - for a $10 saving over 2x single 4.12 it would need something more to entice people I would have thought

@BarbaraZ I'm guessing that it's the pcb that is 76x44, as overall it is much closer to square, looks good though.

I think that dropping the anti spark/on:off button is a mistake, as most would prefer two seperate units it seems (one burns out, only need to replace one) and this dual is more or less the same overall size as two seperate units anyway...

Wouldn’t you rather have the actual Antispark between your ESC and Battery as opposed to on it? For the former, it’s only a matter of replacing one pluggable upgradable  part, for the latter , if that switch breaks...

## \#476 Posted by: direct_drive Posted at: 2018-08-11T20:51:38.771Z Reads: 268

As it happens, I personally would.

I'd actually rather have a dedicated anti spark with a single switch between my battery and my two seperate vesc/esc (purely because I'm a tinkerer, and things break, and I'd rather replace one esc, or one fuse etc etc)

However, if I was going to design a dual esc, or be tempted into buying a dual module, I would rather it had on board 'soft start' switching to power the dual aspects of the unit on as a whole, as - in this instance, it isn't an "anti spark" switch as such, it's just a button that activates a low amp switch that powers on the high amp circuit.

We only call the anti spark switch an anti spark switch because of the sparks that are inherent with an unswitched esc; with onboard soft start switch, the spark is a moot point.

(If that makes any sense)

Everyone has different tastes, FSESC product line will be completed gradually to try our best to maximum extent satisfy the different users need.

There are two types of builds typically, both requiring their own solution. One where a heatsink cover can be easily integrated into an enclosure (esk8 longboard and similar) and the other is a waterproof case for mountainboards.

Typically, MTB builders are interested in high amp escs. I would consider offering a dual waterproof enclosure for the 150A only. Personally, I would never purchase an esc for which a waterproof enclosure (or close to it) is not available.

I agree with @telnoi
What for me is still an issue with all the waterproof dual cover, there is usually no space for a receiver and Bluetooth module. 
For me it would be great if the waterproof heatsink is big enough to place this two things inside too

@BarbaraZ
Why is the flipsky VESC build with MOSFETs that have significantly worse cooling specs that the original 4.12 VESC ?
The Rds(on) is twice larger with the FESC 6.6 than with the 4.12 VESC. The Rjunction-case is three times better with the 4.12 MOSFET. Both indicates that the flipsky 6.6 MOSFET (which are the same than the 4.20 ones) cooling specs are well behind the the specs of the original 4.12 VESC.

What was the reason for this choice (except for the price which is half for these new MOSFETs) ?

Furthermore if you compare it with the reference VESC6 with directFET, the differences will be even larger !
 
(This is a better place to ask these questions than in the groupbuy thread. I removed the other message).

Price I'm sure is a large part of it. I haven't looked at the gate charge difference on these, but an important point that a lot of people forget is that losses are not only dependent on the Rds_on. Switching losses can in some cases be much larger than Ohmic losses. I'm not sure if they've done their homework on this, but I have a pair of FSESC6.6's sitting in my mailbox waiting for me and I plan to do some testing to see how bad it is, or hopefully how good it is.
Price optimization of a product, from personal experience, is surprisingly difficult.

Edit: so having looked over the datasheets of the IRFS7530 (4.12), IRF7749 (VESC6) and the NTFMS5C628NL (FSESC6.6) I have limited conclusions.

The original 4.12 MOSFET has low Rds_on, but a fairly large gate charge meaning switching losses may be high. But they also have the lowest output capacitance... The VESC6 MOSFET has surprisingly high gate charge and output capacitance, but excellent thermal properties. Switching losses will be very high, but it can handle the heat. Finally, the FSESC MOSFETs have the lowest gate charge of the three and an output capacitance a bit lower than the VESC6 FETs. Switching losses will be lower.
I seem to remember someone doing the math on switching losses and came to some conclusion, might be earlier in this thread.

There's confusion about our MOSFETs from many people, according to the datasheet. Yes, it may not as good as directfet or the original 4.12 VESC mos, but according to our real test, the MOS we used now it's good.

Are you saying that you are not using the mosfets that are in your VESC description ? Are you using other FETs ?

May I repeat my question ? why have you chosen these new FETs and not the original ones (4.12) if the original ones were better ? Is ther an electrical argument ? Is it an availability issue ?

If you haven't realized this whole esc is on cheaper side, cheap mosfets, half capacity capacitors, I wouldn't be surprised that expensive high voltage ceramic ones are missing as I haven't seen any big ceramic caps on the other side...

Just be careful with experimenting with it.. Run on comfy safe limits, I doubt this hardware support real alternative limits like original 4.12 or 6...

Can you comment on the specific point of ceramic capacitors from @Kug3lis ? If I am correct, this point is not explained in the link.
This has shown to be a crucial point of reliability in the VESC design (changelog from VESC4.7 to VESC4.12 and upgrade from Chaka relied largely on higher grader ceramic capacitors).

Hi,

I have been running the ESC in FOC with 240kv motors on 10S without any issues for some time now! I think it is a very good deal for the price so I decided to sell them on my website! [You can check it out here](http://electricskateboard.repair/index.php?id_product=45&controller=product), they are on preorder right now and will be available on the 9th of September (maybe even a little earlier depending on shipping).

My real battery voltage at the terminals is lets say 35.5 V, but the vesc sees 34V (in vesc tool, and the measurement is very erratic, fluctuates very fast in +- 0.5V approximately) when mesuring voltage inside vesc on the xt connector i also see normal 35.5V

Strangely I first noticed this on my voltmeter, which is a 3 wire one - i feed ground and +5V from the ppm output on the ESC and the sense wire goes dorectly to + terminal on the XT conmector. On 4.12 vesc this was ok, i had correct readings. i got confused when i saw wrong reading in Vesc tool too. So this must be an issue in the ESC itself? 

@Kug3lis any idea what might be causing this? Electronics is not my strong suit..
@BarbaraZ do you know about this?

Can you test this? 

I also noticed that the measured to real difference changes with voltage of the pack. When i charged to 41, vesc saw like 40.5v, so 0.5volt diff. when pack is at 35.5, vesc sees 34. Already a 1.5v diff. That is very strange to me.

We have corrected the description in the blog about ceramic capacitors and inductor, thank you for your suggestion @kug3lis
There are 8pcst ceramic capacitors in the mini ESC4.20, you can check the details on our website, or I can mark it here. 
We optimized the circuit design. After our tests, reducing the capacitance has no effect on the controller, works very well. (I have explained it many times) 
On the inductor we use use molding power choke, It has great anti-EMI performace, more costly. 
Due to the 1% deviation in the accuracy of the resistor, resulting in a gap between the actual voltage and the voltage on the vesc tool is about 0.5v.
If you have more questions, wait to see review from others builders.
Thanks for all feedback here.

yes we ran them for performance testing and how the unit functioned over all. We don't pick apart every esc we test, we just don't have the time. In an industry that welcomes diversity at least in the diy community flip sky has brought products to the market that brings more choices. I personally know and see a gap in the affordability side of the industry. Now with that said every version of the esc unit will not have the highest quality of components, realistically they can't. 
to my knowledge we never noticed the difference in voltage, but being that its known now it can be easily compensated for. Does it effect the performance of the unit, NO. can it be corrected or compensated for, YES. 
does it change the overall reliability of this esc, NO.
With all the new advancements now and coming the speed at witch they come will gage the issues we must face building our own boards. AS A COMMUNITY we must maintain the over all willingness to help, give and guide others with our knowledge not confront every variation of something we or (I) don't like, witch is your option and not fact. 
we understand a lot of people on this forum are intelligent engineers, designers and programmers. 
what we don't understand is the bully factor that sometimes accompanies these big brains.

MY OPION is they are fine and can be compensated for. No one should be taking their battery pack down to with in .05v of your batteries min.

I've been running it for a while now. In 100 degree weather and high humidity.. 

It's still running although I had one hiccup when accelerating hard up hill in high heat with my ass being 200lbs. Soo I expected it, but even with that it was after a good a 10 mile ride.. 

I took it easy on the way home. But the next day after cooling it was a beast for the morning ride. Sadly my metr took a shit after the testing phase of my build. So no data although I'm positive it overheated. 

That was the only issue I had, besides that it runs hard.. I run with 60,-60, 40, -12 on a single 6374 setup... My development is nothing but hills and I handle it without issues now.. As long as it isn't 90+ outside it has ran flawless.

If after anti spark switch voltage drops it means either mosfet is not fully open, or its resistance is so high that it decreases voltage which means if you start consuming a lot of current those AS switch mosfets will start burning. 

It's not bully. **WE CARE** about people **lives** here as you go down the hill 20mph and suddenly that AS switch mosfets burn you loose brakes and you crash into something fall down or etc shit happens what will you do then? Who will be responsible for it?

Your ESC suppose to be bulletproof it carries peoples around at high speeds there must not be not a single possibility of mistake in this essential device. I don't see a point of going so cheap just to make it available at a cheaper price range in the cost of quality...

I never understood Chinese people thinking of going all the way cheap... We don't want to introduce global ban the same way "hoverboards" have done it before just because manufacture went so deep into cheaping it out the product that they ditched the most important element of whole device BMS... There is already plenty of shit happening with Chinese boards available at the market. Broken hangers, batteries catching on fire and etc.

If you can't produce a product in good quality don't make a half-ass product and sell it cheap just because you want to grab those lower branch fruits just for profits...

You know that voltage is used in BEMF calculations? and those resistor values need to be used precise ones?

All input values like voltage/current and etc are need to be precise as those numbers are used in calculations you can just put any type of part just because its cheaper...

0.5V in BEMF is a huge difference..

EDIT: BEMF = Back EMF = Back electromotive force/voltage

> Counter-electromotive force (abbreviated counter EMF or simply CEMF),[1] also known as back electromotive force (or back EMF), is the electromotive force or "voltage" that opposes the change in current which induced it. CEMF is the EMF caused by magnetic induction (see Faraday's law of induction, electromagnetic induction, Lenz's Law).

I am leaving this topic and will not be bully for quality just a few regards schematics and specifications are usually done by calculating for specific application not randomly picked from the air, you can't change values and tell everything is alright without explaining (I still haven't heard anything about halving input buffer capacitors) ;) 

Also 10-20$ difference in price is like not going out one weekend for a drink...

You should always remember that cheaping out on essential parts can possibly kill you :blush: (Imagine you ride a car with a frame made out of plastic because it was cheaper.. Would you trust it with your life ;) Now imagine ESC shortens your motor phases which blocks your motor and you sent flying at 20mph)

Good luck

From what I see, most of the answers on the questions about components changes have been : See, we have tested it and it works ... or ... my parts are more expensive, therefore, they should perform better.
To me, this is far from a sufficient argument. We all know that some of the usual problems of the ESCs are happening in specific situations that may not be covered by tests (even extensive ones). Tests are definitively important, but good design supported by theory is equally important.

I very much agree with Kug3lis that important changes in the component choices (like reducing drastically the input caps) should be backed up by detailled argument explaining why it was done. Saying that tests were done is not enough. There is also the change by a factor of 10 of the inductor value in the buck converter (the one that was replaced by a molding choke). There was a discussion on Vedders original blog on this value and there seemed to be min and max value ... and that it is not as simple as "the bigger, the better".  

To put a more positive note, I am very happy to see new actors on the market ... I have bought 2 FSESC 6.6 ;-) but I am also concerned about the reliability of the changes.

I see differences in voltage from 0.5V to 1.5V depending on the voltage in the battery pack! That is a huge difference. And it also not insignificant, since the ESC regulates at what voltage the battery pack is charged during braking. And I want my battery to be operated within the safe voltage limit. Who can tell what the real voltage is fed into the battery now? ESC thinks its 42, but maybe its much much more. I honestly can't form a real argument here, since I really do not know enough about electronics, but having a correct measurement of the most important parameter in the system just **seems** to be rather crucial.

If you do not see the problem in this, its bringing down my confidence in your products a lot.

I can see the point everyone is making. I too can see a safety issue if an unfortunate sequence of events happen. ( speculation ) 
I can also see how critical we can be of this fact. 
I understand the nature of an industry like this and can see the application of this technology well beyond the realm of esk8. 
With that said, it reasonable to say that growth isn’t always in the way you see it. 
We all take a risk every time we step on a powered board or a non powered board. It’s inherently so , regardless of the quality of your components. 
We don’t want to sell something that may hurt someone, but we are not responsible for what the customer does with what they buy. 
I can’t see where a snowboard company is responsible for a customer hitting a tree and braking his back. No
Our goal is to provide choices. Affordable choices. The one thing that is steadily reaching out of control levels. If only a few can afford it. What about everyone else?

[/quote]

Right, let's pay people in Europe identical wages and let's see if they can make a living.
What amazes me is that despite the cheap labour, you find ways of decreasing the cost of critical parts in favour of profit instead of pushing out high quality parts with plenty of leeway to accommodate the ever increasing demands of powerful DIY builds. The high amp ratings are marketed, without making potential customers aware of cut corners nor apparently truly understanding what the consequences may be. 

Sadly, these hacks are not just seen in these new VESC based ESCs. As Kugl3s mentioned, it is also seen elsewhere. Cracked trucks, because someone decided that it was OK just to drill massive holes in them to mount hub motors. Stupid motor constructions where the axis is not properly secured. Cheap glue, causing the magnets to slip and the retainer ring to break loose. Sharp edges, cutting the motor leads. No conformal coating for sensor PCBs, leading to shortcuts blowing up VESCs. I could go on.

Due to all of that shit, esk8 will have a hard time to become legal around the world. Frankly, if I was a politician and had any say in it, I would whitelist certain parts and ban all others until they obtain some kind of certification. ESK8 is transportation. Transportation needs to be safe.

Now to clam that wages and China are to blam is just short sighted. They wouldn’t have that if our countries wouldn’t have given it to them. We all have people that have lost jobs due to out sourcing.
[/quote]

You completely misinterpreted that. Even if certain VESC manufactures here (esk8.de, etc.) were to offer escs with identical components, they would never be able to ask similar prices. To call asking higher prices ''greedy'' is short sighted in itself. It is not by choice that there is a gap in the market that can be filled by others who obtain cheaper resources and I most certainly do not like the fact that the majority of customers are OK with the delivered quality. Their wallets are more important than their safety. I also know that China can in fact produce high quality parts, but it usually requires heavy scrutiny of the manufacturing process, ensuring that quality standards are met and that the parts are actually produced according to spec.

The story about outsourcing is something different entirely. China is becoming automised. The dependency on Human Resources is decreasing and the need for people with a higher education in certain fields (robotics, programming, etc.) is increasing where people with a lower education virtually have no chance. They remain unhappy, complain even more and the world watches. It's a downward spiral.

Then there is the issue of surrounding countries becoming cheaper and gaining knowledge. China is no longer the only country with the knowledge to produce cheap parts.

Anyway, going off-topic. I do hope that your VESC based ESCs are stable enough. Time will tell.

The MOSFETs on the original VESC 4.12 and 6.4 are absolute shit, btw, International Rectifier treats Switching Charge the same way Intel treats Power Efficiency.
The ones from ON Semiconductor are not only cheaper BUT also better. (There's this thing called "Figure of Merit" and if you actually read the datasheet, you'd see it is an order of magnitude better).

The limits advertised on the original 4.12 are bullshit. Quick math on switching and conduction losses shows that over 30A at 37V, the power dissipation (on the power stage) exceeds 6W, way more than the PCB's dissipative power without forced air cooling. The original 6.4 might make it since it is heatsunk to such a large enclosure.

High capacity MLCCs are not necessary on their ESC because they don't do the asinine layout of having the electrolytic capacitors three miles away from the power stage, on a separate board. (Even then, a 10uF MLCC will have the same, or higher, ESR as a 600uF electrolytic, and their electrolytic is already low ESR, anyway)

The accuracy on measuring BEMF is not that critical, all you need to look for is the zero cross. I built an ESC myself using STM32 Nucleo and know this for a fact. I used 5% tolerance resistors in the divider, and 20% tolerance capacitors in the filter (which still left a 30% peak-to-peak ripple in the signal). The algorithm basically sampled the BEMF at random, too. Probing with an oscilloscope, the STM32F446RE detected the BEMF zero cross perfectly, every commutation. Even if you integrate, a 1% deviation is insignificant in the timing. A product that uses 1% tolerance resistors is already high quality, many US manufacturers will use 5% or even 10%  (sometimes even 20%!!) in their products, and those products still work fine. Higher tolerance resistors become ridiculously expensive and can possibly impose stock issues. The original VESC btw, doesn't even implement filters on the phase voltage resistor dividers, which makes switching at high frequency and high duty cycles impossible and really cuts down on the efficiency and worsens noise. (On my ESC, I switched at 40kHz and I could run the eRPM up to 130k+, like over 20k commutations per second, sampling BEMF at 70kHz, it performed marginally better sampling at 400kHz, but then my CPU would only idle 80% of the time instead of 97% of the time;_;, it is currently set to 200kHz according to my configuration in STM32CubeMX).

Even in FOC, on the VESC 4, the current shunt amplifiers are inaccurate as hell (4mV input offset, >1% gain error), and yet it can drive hub motors with literally no noise.

The original VESC already freaking cheaps out on parts. There is literally no transient suppression so to speak of (when RC snubbers are literally pennies to implement), why do you think ESCs from torque boards and other US suppliers break so damn often at 12s?! I saw this happen to my friend's ESC first hand and I repaired it for him.

While Flipsky doesn't address the filtering (would require a firmware modification) and transient suppression issue, (well they partly addressed it by designing a much better PCB that doesn't have shitty ass parasitics and using MOSFETs that aren't garbage), their ESC 4.20 is not only cheaper but superior to many ones from US suppliers: better MOSFETs, proper PCB design and layout (this is a BIG ONE), heatsinks, 6 layer 3oz copper, shielded inductor, etc.
Do you research, and unlike many electrical engineers, FUCKING READ THE DATAHSHEET!

Do you even know why MLCC are required next to switching stage? and for e.g. do you know why they need to be freaking 2x voltage rated? Look at the pictures do they look like 100V capable? Regarding ESR that whole product will not have not even a single component related to low ESR at all. Do you think 600uF capacitors does even have low ESR? They are cheap Chinese no names yes they do have capacity and something looking similar to original values to make it work but it will not have anything even close related to any other capacitors you can get at distributors as Digikey or etc.  Low ESR don't make me laugh clearly you don't know a shit about Chinese products...

[/quote]

Do you even know what tolerance values mean? :D That at higher temperatures and other conditions the resistor will be still within 1%-5% or etc if you use it on a breadboard without any much hard conditions you will still read pretty close resistance even with 5% tolerance rated resistors so it does not matter much, but if you at normal conditions get tolerance deviations when its something wrong with them.

I am not saying VESC is good, it lacks protection, filters, and etc stuff on every piece of the schematic block... Those DRV work perfectly fine in consumer products and etc...

Your argument points would be valid if the parts used in their products wouldn't use no name components...

It's because of transients, at fully charged 12S, the DRV8302 dies to positive transients,
At really high currents, the DRV8302 (I think) dies to a negative transient.

There are countless application notes from companies such as IR, Infineon, TI, etc. that address this problem. 
It is as easy as adding a tuned resistor and capacitor between the node and ground, (RC snubber) that literally costs pennies extra and maybe only an hour of testing on a workbench with an oscilloscope. 
Another device, called a high side node clamp, might be required at high currents, especially considering the godawful reverse recovery time on the IR MOSFET's body diode, to protect the pins of the gate driver from negative transients.

High capacity MLCCs are not necessary on their ESC because they don’t do the asinine layout of having the electrolytic capacitors three miles away from the power stage, on a separate board. (Even then, a 10uF MLCC will have the same, or higher, ESR as a 600uF electrolytic, and their electrolytic is already low ESR, anyway)
[/quote]

Do you even know why MLCC are required next to switching stage? and for e.g. do you know why they need to be freaking 2x voltage rated? Look at the pictures do they look like 100V capable? Regarding ESR that whole product will not have not even a single component related to low ESR at all. Do you think 600uF capacitors does even have low ESR? They are cheap Chinese no names yes they do have capacity and something looking similar to original values to make it work but it will not have anything even close related to any other capacitors you can get at distributors as Digikey or etc.  Low ESR don't make me laugh clearly you don't know a shit about Chinese products... 
[/quote]

I actually do know why bypass capacitors are needed next to anything that switches, I don't think you do; I also know that you don't use ceramic caps to bypass power stages, (their power density is insufficient). Ceramic capacitors need to be 2x rated because they lose most of their capacitance at their rated voltage, you learn something new everyday.
Fun fact, did you know the original VESC 4.12 schematic calls for 50V rated ceramic caps on the supply rails? 
Another trap people fall into is using a ridiculous amount of bypass capacitance on power stages, you don't really need that much.
Is it really a "Chinese no-name"? is the capacitor unmarked and unbranded? You can always ask them where they bought the capacitor from. Even then, it's not a problem if it falls within specification.
Do you know what "ESR" stands for and why it is important?
Do you also know why it is such a horrible idea to put your electrolytic capacitors on a separate board from the power stage, separated by several inches of wire? If you do, then you'd understand why it was somewhat necessary to have a giant 10uf 100V MLCC on the poorly designed PCBs of the 4.12 and not necessary on a PCB that actually HAS THE ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITORS ON THEM. 
You are just using the lack of a ridiculously overpriced (and unnecessary) capacitor as an excuse to devalue the ESC.

And btw, nowadays, most of your Integrated Circuits and passive components from big name companies, like ON Semi and ST Microelectronics, are actually fabricated in plants located in China. I don't understand your obsession with marking products as "Chinese" and then immediately devaluing them for no reason.

The accuracy on measuring BEMF is not that critical, all you need to look for is the zero cross. I built an ESC myself using STM32 Nucleo and know this for a fact. I used 5% tolerance resistors in the divider, and 20% tolerance capacitors in the filter (which still left a 30% peak-to-peak ripple in the signal). The algorithm basically sampled the BEMF at random, too. Probing with an oscilloscope, the STM32F446RE detected the BEMF zero cross perfectly, every commutation. Even if you integrate, a 1% deviation is insignificant in the timing. A product that uses 1% tolerance resistors is already high quality, many US manufacturers will use 5% or even 10% (sometimes even 20%!!) in their products, and those products still work fine. Higher tolerance resistors become ridiculously expensive and can possibly impose stock issues. The original VESC btw, doesn’t even implement filters on the phase voltage resistor dividers, which makes switching at high frequency and high duty cycles impossible and really cuts down on the efficiency and worsens noise. (On my ESC, I switched at 40kHz and I could run the eRPM up to 130k+, like over 20k commutations per second, sampling BEMF at 70kHz, it performed marginally better sampling at 400kHz, but then my CPU would only idle 80% of the time instead of 97% of the time;_;, it is currently set to 200kHz according to my configuration in STM32CubeMX).
[/quote]

Do you even know what tolerance values mean? :D That at higher temperatures and other conditions the resistor will be still within 1%-5% or etc if you use it on a breadboard without any much hard conditions you will still read pretty close resistance even with 5% tolerance rated resistors so it does not matter much, but if you at normal conditions get tolerance deviations when its something wrong with them.

I am not saying VESC is good, it lacks protection, filters, and etc stuff on every piece of the schematic block... Those DRV work perfectly fine in consumer products and etc...

Your argument points would be valid if the parts used in their products wouldn't use no name components...
[/quote]

I don't think you know what tolerance means. TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT is a completely separate parameter used to qualify resistors and other passive components. It is normally expressed as parts per million per degree Celsius. Vishay has a really cool (and expensive) resistor that completely mitigates temperature effects. 

Tolerance is the initial deviation from the nominal value when it leaves the factory.

Were the 10k resistors I used 10k Ohms? More like 10.2k and 9.7k when I measured with a multi-meter. Was that a 5% deviation? No, of course not. Was it greater than 1% deviation? Yes. What does this mean? It means 1% tolerance is already more than good enough for most products, including professional U.S. products. 

How do you know they are "no-name" components? Do you ever see a passive component (that isn't a giant electrolytic) branded with a part name or manufacturer name? Even then does it really matter? The reason why passive components are COLOR-CODED rather than branded is because their production is standard and no secret to anyone. The manufacturer doesn't really matter unless the components were consistently out of specification, in which case if they were, problems would arise very quickly and would've been reported on this thread. No, a 0.5V difference is not significant unless you are trickle charging the batteries (which this device does not), and if you're really worried about overcharging your batteries during regen, then just charge your battery pack to 90 or 95%, or just change the voltage cutoffs in VESC tool to compensate, sheesh. 

You'd be pretty hard pressed to find the DRV8302 used in a consumer product other than the VESC (which honestly really should use separate gate driver ICs anyway, that's why ebike controllers do, and they don't break unless you crash into a building). The reason why people still buy the chip from TI is because they don't subject it to (or beyond) its absolute maximum ratings on a regular basis, most engineers are rational enough to use the chip in 24V maybe 36V systems, but they don't push it further, and if they do, they take precautions to ensure it doesn't explode, transient suppression being one of those precautions.

I'm not sure what was going through Benjamin Vedder's head when he decided to use inferior International Rectifier MOSFETs and completely leave out transient suppression when designing the VESC, maybe it was so he could sell more VESCs as many would inevitably break, or he completely derped out and forgot that switching transients exist.

@Gamer43 
You may well be very competent in electronics but you are very misinformed on the history of the VESC. It is only recently that Ben began to make a substantial amount of money with his design. Before that, he sold a couple of hand soldered VESC (I have one of these early birds) and published the design fully open source.
You don't need to make a contest of offensive statement with Kug3list trying to prove who's got the biggest !

If you have better to share as a fully open source and applicable design, please don't restrain yourself and do it ! We appreciate very much your knowledge (well at least I do), there is no use to humiliate those who have other arguments (or less knowledge I cannot judge).

I apologize for that, Ben must've been using it in lower voltage designs and felt transient supression was unnecessary (because it is in that situation, and would be a waste of time figuring out the right values to insert for a snubber of any sort). It just really bugs me that sellers of his design misled customers into thinking it could handle 12S at 60A, only to leave them with a pound and a half of electronic waste because they stressed the controller beyond its limits.

I am working on a controller for a college thesis, and I will most definitely make its files open-source once I complete it.

So, for no-electro engineers guys like me, but huge VESC fan, user and rider :blush:, what will you suggest guys ? I ask to all of you Kug3, Gamer, HyperIon etc

We should use vesc at alf what said the seller ?
What could we do to upgrade it with what we could, more than buy heatsink case ? Change Caps ? air forced etc ?
But most important good parameter set !
I saw that Enertion engineers recommended 30amps batt max? (Right?)
I ask cause I used VESC at 12s like alf of us here, without any problem, but I never set them at the limit too (except V6 that handle a lot) .

What will be the "real"/"more safety" parameter and setup for the 4.20hw ?
Thanks for your help :v:

12S is fine for BLDC mode since there is a lot less switching going on than in FOC, and problems normally arise on a fully charged battery, since the voltage is so high (50.4V).

If you have no heatsinking or forced air cooling, I wouldn't run more than 30A continuous through the motor, I have a VESC from TB and one I hand soldered (with different MOSFETS, IPB014N06), the power stage is almost too hot to touch running only 20A (around 10 continuous) motor current on the ESC from TB.

With proper heatsinking, you could probably get away with 40-50A continuous motor current, but the TO-263 package is very difficult to heatsink properly with an external heatsink, especially since the high side and low side MOSFETs are on opposite sides of the board.

Max battery current is whatever your battery can handle, since it is the motor current that is run through  each phase in the power stage. 

For the Flipsky 4.20 hardware, I would be very comfortable running 40 A continuous through it and don't doubt the 50A rating, especially since it comes with its own heatsink, and doesn't suffer from high switching losses that the 4.12 hardware does (in fact, it has minimal switching losses and is not even worth calculating at this point since it is so low with the NTMFS5628NL, it never amounts to more than a watt within the usable current and voltage range). With forced air, you could probably pull 70A out of the Flipsky 4.20, but take that with a grain of salt.

Always be careful with fully charged 12S, one stray transient and you have to heatgun or hot air a new DRV8302, but I would bet that the failure rate is lower since the parasitics on the PCB will most definitely be better. Again, should be reasonably ok with BLDC mode, but with all the extra switching in FOC, I would not run FOC at fully charged 12, I would undercharge the battery to 48V or even lower. My friend's ESC from DIY ElectricSkateboard died when he tested FOC at fully charged 12S (on one of those huge 6374 motors for that matter).

Thanks for your very helpfull feedback ! 
I charge 4.16v/cell so I'm a bit less than 50v and no direct downhill around my house (I wiil set it at 4.15v/cell or even less).
So a 10s setup I more appropriate/appreciate by the vesc ?
When do you say 40A for the 4.20 its motor or batt max ?
I ask cause I used 12s on all my setup now single or dual all set at motor max > max amps from reseller characteristics, batt around the max too but a bit less (5 / 10Amps less than) whitout any problem. But I prefer to ask Im waiting my 4.20 dual and mini.
Once again thanks you ;)

10S works great on the VESC, and I am guessing that is the application it was originally designed for. 

40A max for batt and 60A motor should be fine, since you won't be running those currents all the time. 

Were you running BLDC mode at 12S? Since you undercharge your batteries that's most likely why your VESCs haven't exploded, which is smart, improves battery life and keeps the controller safe. 

The VESC killer is fully charged 12S running Field Oriented Control, BLDC mode (slow decay) seems to skirt by because it switches only one phase instead of all three.

Thanks, I am trying to figure out a way to do an on-the-fly resistance measurement so that my controller will be able to estimate motor temperature without a sensor and compensate accordingly.

My idea right now is that every once in a while, when a zero cross in the BEMF is expected on one of the phases, the controllers pulls the phase to high impedance before the zero cross, and measures the BEMF. Really close to the zero cross, it will then inject current into the phase and then measure the rate of current decay. Using the previously measured BEMF, it could then extrapolate the BEMF into the current decay period (since the BEMF is linear with respect to time for the most part in this region) and then do a resistance calculation (accuracy may vary greatly). Problems I could see with this is whether it'll end up interfering with the Sliding Mode Observer, but there should be a way to compensate for it considering it directly measured the BEMF on one of the phases. 

Or I could be approaching this totally wrong and there is actually a way to measure resistance using d-axis current injection, but I have yet to see an implementation or paper on this.

No problem. If your controller has been working at 12S for a while, there shouldn't be anything to worry about as long as you keep your set limits where they are. Some DRV8302s are more rugged than others, and I guess my friend just got unlucky with his.

@BarbaraZ why not make the heatsink like the dual escape esc heatsink or dual focbox heatsink from @Kug3lis , in that way the PCB is more protected, and we can cut out in the enclosure for better heat dissipation, and it also gives a little more space in the enclosure. If it increases the price a bit, so be it.

I agree price should be lower if possible without significant reduction in quality. But what Kug3lis is saying is that the modified opensource schematics should be released. He was actually asking FLIPSKY people to publish the modified schematics as is the law, your brother came in FLIPSKY's defence when Kug3lis commented that they didn't reply.

To clarify one thing: If you distribute GPLed code (convey the code) you have to pass on the GPL license to the customer. You need to sow the copyright (in this case Benjamin Vedder and relevant other contributors) and you need to offer the exact source code that is being distributed. Since the Hardware comes with the firmware installed, you distribute the GPLed firmware code together with the hardware. It's like selling a computer with pre-installed GPLed operating system or flashed GPLed bios. 
So you need to make sure that you meet **all** requirements of the license.
If you don't meet the license requirements, your license terminates itself automatically (section 8 GPL) and a case of copyright infringement is the consequence whenever you distribute the code together with the hardware.

So make sure that your supplier can offer you the exact source code of the firmware used, so that you can re-distribute it to your customers. It's a chain that doesn't want to break up somewhere. 
As a distributor it's your liability to follow the terms of the GPL-License! 
If your supplier can't hand over the exact source code used, you better stay away from selling the devices.

Benjamin and I have made the decision to go down the line described on the VESC-Project website. 
Otherwise we would not see the kind of innovation we have seen in the past. Only if you design something yourself, you know all the details which are essential to actually produce something that works.
Benjamin has stated pretty clearly why he thinks it is best to publish the schematics only. 
Some people have reverse engineered the V6 (without understanding some really important details), other have taken the chance to make changes and designed something new or different. 
If you are able to reverse engineer a VESC 6, you could have just designed your own, more specific ESC in less time. You would have had USPs and would have pushed things into a different direction instead of copying an existing design that is available already.  

Personally I think the current situation is a very good compromise in between the different opinions about OS and Hardware. Schematics are a great way to allow people to design something themselves. 
This way more and more hardware will get available in all sorts of different markets.
99% of the work is in the software. There are millions of different hardware designs possible, all running the same software/firmware. Software and hardware are two pair of shoes.

That is exactly what I have said. You garantied during months that you would publish a full desilgn with hardware. And you never did. To me, it looks very much that you said that to cool down hot discussions that were very much critics against your agressive arrival in the VESC world. At the end, it served well your purposes, and you abandonned your commitment when things were enough advanced for your buisness.

Of course you think that it is a good compromise !! No wonder !! 
You should restrain yourself from lecturing people after what you have done with your own commitments torward this community.

Just received two FSESC 4.20 in the mail via DHL today.

So far, I am impressed by the build quality; it works much better than the TorqueBoards ESC from DIYElectricSkateboard. The size of the entire ESC, including the bus capacitors, is as big as the PCB portion of the TB ESC and other 4.12 boards. Wire insulation is silicone, JST connectors are heat resistant plastic. Lead-free solder is a bit annoying, but hey, that's because of RoHS.
The heat dissipation of the PCB is much better than the TB ESC; the STM32F405RG would get warm on the TB ESC when idling, the FSESC 4.20 stays cool all throughout the entire board even when running 5 - 10A.
It pays to have 6 layers of 3 oz. copper. 

I don't doubt the 50A continuous current rating, on trapezoidal control (BLDC mode), that's about 12W of heat dissipation in the power stage, which the heatsink can handle just fine. 
On field oriented control, 50A RMS (which is 70A peak) would result in closer to 20W of power (more due to RDSon variation with temperature), which would stress the dissipative power of the heatsink, so the controller would probably only be able to handle 40A RMS continuous in FOC.
Switching losses are literally negligible on the NTMFS5C628NL (like, 0.3W total), so they are not included in this calculation (which is nice because now your current ratings are independent of switching frequency and system voltage).


An interesting peculiarity is that the TB ESC (and the ESC I DiYed) measures 27uH of inductance on my deltawound hub motors while the FSESC 4.20 measures 65uH, but the FSESC runs much better (a lot less cogging, lower current draw for same load), anyway.

One qualm I have is that none of the components have silkscreen (which can be explained by the component density, haha), meaning if I ever need to replace the DRV8302 and accidentally knock something off, I'm left to probing with my multimeter to figure out what other components and pins it was connected to. Hopefully it won't ever have to come to that, though :) but, I for one would greatly appreciate if Flipsky could release the gerber files so we know which component is which :).

They are currently in the process of making that available. I had time to explain exactly what was required with reference to all the material on the vedder site to Barbara and her team. Once this information is available she will update the community. 
Going back over some of the conversations in this post it is apparent that a language/ translation issue may have a lot to do with the confusion. 
Once the material is available that should satisfy the license requirements and we can let flipskys products speak for themselves. 
I hope we all try to understand.

Just did a road test with the fsesc 4.20 minis.

I wasn't able to collect any telemetry data, but the ESCs handled more smoothly than the previous VESCs I was using. 
I was drawing somewhere along the lines of 15A from the battery on each ESC when climbing hills, and phases currents went up to the 30A range.
One issue I encountered is the ESC throws a DRV fault during high torque stall conditions and sudden changes in acceleration, I would think it is an overcurrent fault, but the VESC 4 schematics shows that OC faults are disabled, so not sure what is exactly causing the DRV fault. During bench testing, the reported current was well over 40A and into the 50s when the max motor current was set to 40A.
Just to be clear, the fault is thrown only in extreme situations that most riders should avoid in the first place.
I had motor current set to 40A, battery current set to 20A on Field-Oriented Control.

Overall, I am pretty satisfied with the mini FSESC 4.20. Sometime later I see if I can hook up an HC-05 to collect telemetry data.

Only when you tell to controller to go from 0 to +-40A in under two seconds. 
When it does throw the fault, it simply lets the motor freewheel.
The fault clears quickly, letting your remote return to center resets it.
Like any controller, always best to ease up on the throttle.
I am almost certain that if I tried to same thing on my TB ESC, the DRV8302 would've blown up a second time.

That's because I normally avoid the situations that cause it to throw the fault, which were very high torque stall conditions (like 30 or 40% grade from standstill to vroom), and very sudden changes in acceleration (lets go uphill at a calm 8-10 mph then FLOOR IT AND SLAM THE BRAKES!).

Just to be clear, it only throws the fault in extreme situations that most riders should avoid in the first place. I'm guessing the firmware for the VESC 4 has issues with current regulation at stall, (since it only uses two low side shunts; any piece of software would struggle with that since current changes so quickly and you can only measure it so often. Changing the current control PID loop to accommodate stall would make it unresponsive everywhere else) and my previous 4.12 VESCs (one of which is from DiyElectricskateboard) had even more issues with hill starts.

It works fine when you **ease it up to full throttle**; the fault is thrown when you go from zero to full throttle as quickly as positive ramping time will let you on a 30% grade.
One of my friends did the zero to full throttle thing on his electric skateboard, he was using those big 6374 motors with 15/38 gearing; the board shot out from under him like a rocket, he weighs 220 pounds.

It might also be my motor setup, I'm using hoverboard hub motors that I reterminated into delta configuration; this results in very high magnetizing currents.
I said "flooring it" causes the fault to be thrown, which indicates a very high torque demand. This, in combination with my motors, is probably causing an extreme situation that causes the DRV fault.

I might test it sometime with a 5065 or 6374 motor, maybe with those motors I can floor it with no problem.

If you want to floor it on your skateboard, then I'll concede that the mini FSESC 4.20 is not for you, something VESC 6 based would better suit that purpose, and I also have mad respect for such daredevil behavior.

The mini FSESC 4.20, true to its name, is better suited for more tame purposes :).

Hey e-riders,

I share here too : 
I made a little vid on my unpacking, 1st review, setup, test ride, and "safe" parameters ...
If it could help!
https://youtu.be/1OouVAyi_4I
To bad that my phone scratch metr.at apps every time, I haven't recorded a full ride, but you could find some extracts on my MAD SURFER Build) cause I made some interesting ride test I think.

1st I start with the paramter shared here that was supposed to be ok (40A motor max, and I put only 30A batt max /esc).
But from the 1st 300m I got OverCurrent faults when going uphill, and it was my 1st ride on the MADSURFER so I go really easy ...
Then I made stress tests with going full throttle uphill and braking almost to stop then full throttle, many times, same on flat etc.
On flat at 30A motor max and 25A batt max, it could be ok, but when uphill it faults again...
https://metr.at/r/Py3CR

So I think, try many many setup with the metr.Pro during 2 battery pack of ride test.
Then I find that at 20A Motor & Batt Max all is ok, you could stress it without limit and it responds to the trigger! But the ride is really not kicking ass actually.

**20A Motor Max / -20A Motor Min / 20A Batt Max / -15A Batt Max / 90A Absolute Max**
is the safer parameter I find... I made another ride (I'm about 2 more battery pack only with setup parameters).
https://metr.at/r/OLwiw

If they're good point, it's that they don't heat at all, the range is really good (better than a single 6374 with 4.12 vesc at 50A haha), and you could get a better brake.
This could be nice to pass from single to dual setup, but with same power as one VESC.

```
motor amps can be bigger than bat just because voltage * bat amps = max power so motor amps = max power / duty * voltage

For e.g. Voltage = 50V Duty = 0.5 (50%) Bat Max = 30A

Max power = Voltage * Bat Max = 1500W

So at 50% duty max motor current is (Max Power / (Duty *  Voltage)) = (1500W / (0.5 * 50V)) = 60A but when duty reached the top maximum value (0.95) (1500W / (0.95 * 50V)) = 31.5A so you get limited by bat max as you near full voltage.

So for e.g. at slow start you can consume (Duty 0.1) (1500W / (0.1 * 50)) = 300A but you limit it by Motor amps :)

Don't know if I explained enough but I think it would make more understandable about bat/motor amps :)

So basically as long is with in feasible values you can put motor max as high as you want because would be battery max so max power to limit it. Is it right?

True. But let say that a motor is rated for 50A. By pushing it to 100A if your vesc and battery allow it you will probably imhit that new limit only at starting and maybe make the ride smoother and better acceleration. I am just wondering about it.

Yes, it is that @Benjamin899 , but as my test fails at 40A motor max, why do you want me to test at 60A ... To make a bigger fail ?? I dont understand the point here. I could make the test but for what ?

i dont think it will create a bigger fail, but if you dont feel comfortable testing it, dont do it. Can you change your gearing?

I don't see a point of changing current settings to bigger or changing gearing would help with cut out which happens when current overshoots everything not your motor/batt settings... Technically either it reads shit from current sensor or it just passes through maximum currents

Technically vesc should regulate current so it would never reach over its limit if it does than it means something is bad :)

i can still remember that on my single drive board i also got a couple of ABS overcurrent fautswith my focbox and increasing of my amps in the settings just eliminated those faults, currently i also go around 5% over my amp limits which i set in my vesc tool, but everything works fine. i always assumed that it is normal for a certain tollerance.

@BarbaraZ  When are you going to release schematics of vesc? Because you are selling modified vesc hardware from original schematics and licenses requires you to publish changes.

Also solder balls in motor is not nothing to be concerned you can die because of motor shortening and going into instant braking I can't imagine how can you think that this is not concern... Also loose magnets which were not even mentioned in the blog article..

Didn't the blog say that they sent an entire batch back to make sure that there are no solder balls. There are even changing the assembly to make sure it doesn't happen. Also, they have a retainer ring in their motors now. 

@BarbaraZ, are you using high temperature expoxy now or not?

Magnet retaining ring doesn't do shit about magnets coming loose :) It just makes them stay in place and whole retaining ring bit by bit gets pushed out ;)

Yes I know I dont expect much at least if they want to be recognized as good company they would release it :) Its not like we can overjump they price outside china :D

After they release it we can figure out why 4.20 is failing so much maybe :) It would help them too

I do believe it has been stated on this thread that they are in fact making these changes. The motors with solder balls will be replaced and the materials required by the license will be released. I also would like to remind people that they speack a different language and have a hard time answering ( especially when pressed ) 
I have had contact with Barbara recently and she had stated that because it has to do with licensing they are being thorough in doing so. 
She also assured me that they would start donating as well and publish that as too. 
I would ask that everyone have patience and give them time. They will act on these things, but like any company they want to be sure it in the right way. 
I am also sure if she is available and has the answers I do not. She will give them. 
I appreciate the community’s understanding in our pusut to help flipsky produce a reliable product. 
Thank you

That's a good point actually. Releasing the schematics and letting the community figure out what might be inefficient is a smart thing to do. But I guess from Flipsky's point of view, some other company might "steal" their design.

Off topic, but are your balance wires individually fused? What the big lumps here. 

![image|516x455](upload://67w7RdH8J4RqTUgrwZKtVrs4Bfm.jpeg) 

All those wire stuffed in there kinda makes me nervous. I would put in a few blobs of hotglue or something that prevents the wires rubbing on each other from vibration. And insulate any sharp edges. The wire insulation can wear down from vibration faster then you might expect.

Hi, thank you for your comments.

Yes, each balance wire is individually fused and plus all wires are silicone type insulation.

Once the lid goes down its all pretty well kept in place as there's thin foam on top of the lid.

I have also applied extra insulation where needed and each of the fuses are double heat shrinked.

Cheers :slight_smile:
