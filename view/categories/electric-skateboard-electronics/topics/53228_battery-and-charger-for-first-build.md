Hi there,

I'm thinking about a battery pack for my first build (Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-149KV) and I would like it to be relatively cheap and good, of course ;). I'm thinking about such items:

- 2 x https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-graphene-5000mah-5s1p-65c.html (= 10s lipo)
- https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-battery-harness-10awg-for-2-packs-in-series.html to connect these 2 packs into one (serial)
- https://hobbyking.com/en_us/imax-b6-dc-charger-5a-50w-copy.html - cheap charger for a start
- https://hobbyking.com/en_us/fire-retardant-lipo-battery-bag-220x155x115mm-with-handle.html - batteries bag
- https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-s-anti-spark-connector-2pairs-bag.html - anti spark

Does it make sense?

And one more question, keeping in mind I want to buy 2 x 5S battery pack, using those two items:
- https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-multi-pack-serial-balance-board-xh.html
- https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-parallel-adapter-1pc.html
will I able to charge two packs in parallel? 

Cheers,
Pawel

Yes, your setup seems like it should work alright. Just know that your range will be limited at is it only 5ah. Also, you could charge them in parallel, however you would have to remove them from the enclosure every time to charge and rewire from a series to parallel before charging. I would recommend you do a setup like this. https://youtu.be/jxHQjlHv1y4
