```
I've been searching and am unable to locate any manual or thread that goes over this.
I have my remote connected and it seems to work fine except that it turns itself off every once in awhile. It's fully charged and once it connects, I get two red lights. Is that normal? If I just turn it back on, everything works fine again.

Thanks
