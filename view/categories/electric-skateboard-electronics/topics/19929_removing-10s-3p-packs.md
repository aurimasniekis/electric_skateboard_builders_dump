Do you think that if I were to make all of the conectors on the battery have bullet connectors I would be able to swap out these two 10s3p packs by simply removing the jst connector from the battery that is in the board along with its connections to the bms and add the other one? <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/5/45c8845a87c0be8c827a97e584fd7b49df0b7c42.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/6/e655b495e0cb0dfd2676a8cfe67fc97cdef21aa6.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/9/493f38a19c9ddb4aea9b7f04a3c2ebcfae4708d6.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/2/02a24e84c8987859271c51ff404f2a6b07ff7651.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Basically want to be able to just swap battery by removing balance lead from bms and the connectors which I will change out to 3.5mm bullet connectors

one bms with multiple battery packs? should be fine. and there shouldn't be a spark, that would be bad lol

Should 3.5mm bullets be good enough for the current or do u think I'll need 4mm
```

I would go with 4mm. 
i think i have 3.5 on this rc car motor, i wouldnt' trust them with more than 30A.

but really an xt60/90 so you don't have to worry about polarity.

what bms do you have? 
i just found a super cheap <$20 10s 45A/100A bms. I think I'm going to order a couple and test.
it seem too good, but it could change the game for swappable packs!

Might want to heat shrink those batteries though.

Heat shrink is cheaper and less messy though.
