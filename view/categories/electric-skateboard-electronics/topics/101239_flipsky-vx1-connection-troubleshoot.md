Hi , I have the flipsky vx1 remote and have had 3 random disconnects out of about 100 rides , should I be worried and try and troubleshoot the source of the problem ? Itâ€™s hooked up to a Unity inside a Kaly 2.0 , might have been just bad luck or is there anything I can look for

Make sure that both connections can't move (hot glue is your friend). I never had any dropout ever with this remote even though its from ebay and not directly from flipsky.
