There isn't much information on Vedder's nunchuk RF floating around so I think it's time we start a thread dedicated to the project. I made an order with OshPark and plan on documenting the build for everyone to follow.

Hardware: [vedderb/nunchuk_rf_hw
][1]


Firmware: [vedderb/nunchuk_mod
][2]


PCB's on OshPark: [NunchukRF_v51][3]

Tri Wing Screwdriver: [Google search][4]

So that board replaces the board already inside the nunchuck? I dont get what they are doing exactly. What is the point of this board? Sorry if this is a dumb question.... i just dont understand the project.

The nyko kama is also hit and miss for some people.  Frequent to intermittent to few random dropouts.  This replace sounds much more robust

Depends if we can get zero drops. Those drop outs are unacceptable. If I do sell them they will be really affordable. Around the same price as a gt2b remote.

Thanks for sharing this @chaka I've hoped for more info on this development. I've recently (and reluctantly)  given up on my Nyko Kama(s) with VESC. I love the form factor of the nunchuck, and "perpetual steez" is wonderful. But my experience has been that the Kama receiver just isn't durable enough when connected to VESC. Both of mine have had intermittent dropouts after about 15 miles of ride time. It is zero fun to ride fearing that the connection will betray me at a critical moment! I'm hopeful that Vedder's replacement will be an improvement.

Have some black Nunchuks ordered. Should stay looking nicer longer than white. I am building 3 total for testing on this first round. 

The extra two have been spoken for already. If we get something useful I will consider building more for people who want one.

Looks great.. Will be awesome once more people test it.

Nyko Kama + receiver itself seems to be the main issue. The 2.4ghz will be an awesome upgrade.

It's cool too since we can actually use Wired Wii Nunchucks for this hack versus Nyko Kama's not being as readily available anymore.

I have successfully uploaded the firmware and have a single unit working and just received 9 more pcb's from oshpark this morning. I have been so focused on the VESC project that I have not had as much time as I would like to fully test the nunchuk-mod. I would like to try and design a FHSS pcb for the nunchuk that could utilize the GT2B receiver. FHSS transceivers are much more expensive than the AFH transceivers used by bluetooth style transmitters so it may be more cost effective to just pull components off the GT2B to make this happen.

@chaka just a thought; It is excellent to consider cost in the design of the controller, but right now the "desired" controller options (full badwolf mod or enertion\carvon's new remote) are selling for $90-$110 usd. If you beat that price point at all for a complete reliable remote it will be a  win!

If i order the board from Oshpark, do i only have to wire up the battery and buttons from the Wii Nunchuck,
upload the firmware and its ready to roll? Hope someone can enlighten me or post a quick tutorial!

I'll eventually post a "what i did" kind of thing. 

But basically 
Get a cheap wired nunchuck
Dismantle it and salvage the casing, buttons and thumbstick 
Order the pcb from osh park
Populate the pcb, your soldering skillz need to be spot on, there's a fancy qfn package with thermal pad
Print this usb shroud http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1261253
Assemble the whole thing with the new pcb and battery.
Open ubuntu and program the firmware http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=44

Wire up the nrf transceiver to the vesc
Open the bldc tool, enable the nrf app, put the controller id according to the 4 populated id resistors on the nunchuck pcb

Test the thing out, hold C and Z, red led should on and stay solid.

Voil√†.

I was planning on using only one, but i figured i was going to lose the spare one anyways. I just broke off a spline inside the nunchuck to fit both of them

FYI for people who doesn't know what it's, it's basically a Nunchuck PCB design & components that is compatible with VESC. Since Nyko Kama is getting rare and the support for other brands are quite limited, Vedder and his friend are building their own version of "Nyko Kama" but only on the electronic side.

Beautiful!  Thank you!

My board are here, components should be here soon.  For what it's worth, I'm an R2-D2 builder and will be using a pair of these with custom firmware to control my R2 unit.  I set out to make my own board like this (I'm an embedded firmware engineer) but this is just perfect.

And it uses 2.4ghz radiofrequency in stead of bluetooth, so the Nyko Kama drop/signal issues should be fixed with this right?

It uses AFH, adaptive frequency hopping, also called bluetooth. It will have some of the same problems any other AFH controller.

Ideally we would have FHSS for throttle and braking and AFH for telemetry.

```
Personally I don't think the exact modus of transmission plays a great role in safety or reliability in general.
The logic (or lack of) between receiver and (V)ESC is of greater importance.
You could have an uber-reliable connection between transmitter and receiver, and still run run out of battery on your transmitter which -with wonky logic- could cause the board to go full throttle. Most RC receivers have a fail safe setting which makes the output go to neutral (or a pre determined setting) if the TX/RX connection is lost.
Does the Nunchuck RF solution offer this kind of fail safe logic ?
Information about this thing seems to be scattered all over the forums.

## \#40 Posted by: laurnts Posted at: 2016-02-09T16:15:09.571Z Reads: 366

```
My Ts3t trackstar remote has a fail-safe function build in when signal is lost. I could set it to return to specific value of PWM (1500 for example) when signal has lost. This will loosen the throttle power to the board. I don't know how this technology works, but I assume it sends presignal / prememory up to the receiver module when connection is lost set to 1500.

But from BLDC tool it's self, I believe I've seen also a VESC setting for fail-safe signal lost. This is useful for our Nunchuck remote to add 1 extra layer of security incase suddenly remote goes out of battery / slammed and destroyed due to fall.

## \#41 Posted by: chaka Posted at: 2016-02-09T16:18:43.930Z Reads: 349

```
@trbt555 It really does play a huge role. 

In simple terms AFH looks for a selective clean signal over a more narrow band. The goal here is getting a crystal clear signal, however, when encountering interference or sudden weakness in signal you can loose throttle/brake control.

FHSS takes the good with the bad with its frequency spectrum, and as far as I am aware not susceptible to dynamic interference like AFH is. The signal is not as clean but more then suitable for pulse modulated signals.

The biggest problem in using AFH for throttle or braking is the possibility of total signal loss due to dynamic interference. Might not be a huge issue at low speed but it can get ugly at 30+mph. If you have any kind of drag brake set it will send you into a fishtail.

Quick question: You know how the nyko kama comes with a receiver and it's wireless. The corded one doesn't come with a wireless receiver does it? What receiver do we use on the vesc if we buy a corded one? Sorry if I've mis-understood how this works.

This is the connections from the vesc to the nrf. You need to add a decoupling capacitor on the 3.3v and gnd of the nrf, 2.2uF will do. Dont forget to jump the CE of the nrf to the vcc or 3.3v

Vesc Nrf
Clk. Clk
Mosi. Mosi
Miso. Miso
Ss. Ss
Vcc. 3.3v
Gnd. Gnd
Vcc. CE


Here are the receivers, made 2, one is with the mini nrf, i need to complete it, <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a7cdbe02a14eff70a28898349ca87f1864900164.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Hello skate builders,

my first post on forums, but I must say that i'm amazed with the forum.Lots of useful info. I'm also into building e-skate.

now back on topic. Check these cheap bluetooth controllers out:

 Vegas sucks too, all the fancy lights just hide the piece of crap it really is but you don't hear any of us randomly spouting off like we have a case of mild turrets ;)

This is the type of attitude I commonly see on the sphere from a few bad actors. It is very counterproductive and I hope it will be moderated by the community as a whole over here. If you can't help yourself then at least do this in an appropriate thread and leave the technical threads alone.

Yea cool! At one point I was using https://www.sparkfun.com/products/705
With a 5dbi antenna on both RX and TX I could go a good 300meters away!

If you don't mind soldering 3 wires on to your pcb I can also send you the code for the Uart connection
Then u can use the HC-05 modules that you have or the HM-10 modules when you get them

Dear Community,

I am recently finishing my eboard and got aware of the nunchuck control unit. Is someone of you still selling some Nunchuck PCBs for a shipment to Germany? A price information would also be handy. 

I would be glad to get my hands on 1 or 2.

Hello everyone,
is there a way to have one of these pcb?
I'm trying to make the code to work with a stm32f103 board of mine (which is basically the same chip than the stm32f100 with more features), I plugged a nrf24l01, some buttons, ... compiled the code for my chip model, flashed it, and it seems to work. I can see spi signal on every lines (including miso), but I can't make it to talk with the VESC, despite I can also see that there is som data on spi lines, the leds are not indicating anything...
I'm using hardcoded address : 05.
The deep low power feature make it very difficult to debug, could you tell me where to disable it in chibios?
the same goes for VESC, the debugger is loosing connection very soon, so I can't see if there is some data received, 
Thank you very much for any help.
Roman

There is a reason why they put a drop of black glue on the chip... my guess is that is is not a nrf24L01 but a substitute without all of the functionality...

It looks like they are using SE8R01 instead of NRF24L01. Same pinout on the module, but a little different protocol. This should be the problem why they are not working.

Long story short: On wednesday I had trouble with the VESC Nunchuk RF. It was like a normal skateboard run, but abruptly the nunchuk was not working anymore. All stick inputs don't affected anything on the VESC and it was driving with full speed without a chance to stop it. Not just that I wasn't able to stop with the motor the VESC was spinning the motor like on full throttle. The last attempt to stop it with sitting down failed and the board throw me of on 52kmh (around 32mph). Not a good feeling at all.
Fortunately I was wearing a helmet, but that doesn't protect the rest of the body... :disappointed_relieved:

Well I'm happy to do as much or as little as you'd like.
What I have currently (just checked): 
- 1 Blank PCB
- most of the discrete components
- 2 small li-po batteries (they came in a 3-pack and I used 1 in mine)
- Female micro-USB connectors (I used micro instead of mini)
- Ability and tools to make them

What I'd need to have a finished PCB
- A few of the components, like the processor and LEDs, that I don't have
- the RF Transmitter

What I'd need to get after that to have a fully working unit
- Nunchuck shell (with the joystick and C-Z buttons)

So at a minimum I'd probably need a week and a half to get the 1 PCB I have up and running (order the parts, assemble, etc). If there's enough demand, I can certainly order more of everything, including more PCBs from oshpark, then assemble, test, and get them to those who'd like one. I love mine :)

Maybe that would be interesting for you also. Benjamin says on his forum:

> The beta VESC also has an NRF and antenna, and we are trying to make a kit for the nunchuk as well that you can assemble yourself soon.

http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=590

So it looks like there is a kit coming from the "right" source someday and when I am not mistaken the NRF IC will also be soldered on the PCB directly, so you can use an original NRF IC and not the cheap ones on the china modules.
```

I just have the standard ones (I used the OshPark link at the top of this thread). To my understanding Jacob's nunchuckRF w/ bluetooth has pretty much died. If you can find the hardware and firmware files somewhere, I'd be happy to work on it (I'd love to make myself one as well!), but I couldn't find much more than a few pictures and upset people.

For a finished PCB (major soldering done) I could do a small run for about $25+shipping. If more people want them (larger run), I could probably get it down closer to $20
You would just need to get and attach (solder) a battery, USB, the C-Z buttons, and the joystick and then put it in the shell.

Edit: I can't seem to find a US reseller for the NRF24L01+ module, which means I'd have to get it from China so it'd be a few weeks out.

Been using this for some time now. Can't see why anybody would use another remote (minus maybe a screen). You don't need to turn it on, with the stick from an legit nunchuck it's so smooth, no dropouts, plus you can connect the nunchuck to bldc tool and view info from your VESCs.

Highly recommend people to make these.

No it's Vedder's. The one mentioned in this thread with different transceiver modules (at both ends) and one with the nRF24L01 directly on the PCB is also in the works.

The goal is to find completely reliable setups as some people have been having problems with drop-outs.
How has yours worked in this regard?

Until lately I've had very good luck with the mini module on the PCB in the nunchuck and the long range module (with the external antenna) on the vesc side. 2 weeks ago I think my receiver module got fried. It cut out and I haven't been able to get it to connect again (2 weeks later...so not just an intermittent signal drop).

I've found the non antenna module sensitive to placement. Right above the vescs results in very poor range but if you move it even a few inches away from the motor wires and vescs it's great.

I have done quite a few now. In my experience, Ubuntu is the only real option. I know the program he (vedder) uses to flash the firmware (it's called stm32flash) works on Windows, but there's a bunch of other dependencies that I only really know how to do on ubuntu. I basically just  follow the instructions outlined by vedder for his speed controller (http://vedder.se/2015/01/vesc-open-source-esc/ starting at "Software Installation and Configuration Tutorial") combined with some posts on his forum (http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=44&sid=a0a9ad1a784307f48f455fd389b84a2c).

After getting all of those dependencies in place, the basics of it is you download the firmware (https://github.com/vedderb/nunchuk_mod) and stm32flash (https://sourceforge.net/projects/stm32flash/), unpack stm32flash, then unpack the firmware package into a folder in the stm32flash folder. Then you open terminal, cd to that nunchuck directory, and run "make upload"

It's tough to remember exactly what all I did, so I'll have to go through with a fresh copy of ubuntu and make a video. Probably won't have time this weekend, but I probably can next week sometime.

Well not to be rude the ranges you get from the nrf smd's are terrible... Atleast for me. Thats why I asked what range you get? But there is a simple solution another nrf smd with the long range edition, in built antenna with PA and LNA. I have not tested it yet but I will confirm it in the end of the next month.

Hello!
I just built this NunchukRF 5.1. I have had problems. And i need some clarifications if someone can answer.

When i upload the code, (make upload) that's pulled from git, it goes ok. But then it is all dead.
It starts to work after i have "activated" it by connecting to Windows machine or by pressing "connect" on BLDC Tool. Even then it can't connect to VESC.

Another scenario; everything the same except i upload this mystery code that i found on this german site: http://www.elektro-skateboard.de/forum/eigenbauten-95/nunchuk-rf-5092.php and it actually connects to VESC and functions ok.

It would be alright with this solution, but it deactivates randomly, or when i disconnect(desolder) the battery. Sometimes middle of a ride, or when i let it be after a long ride. I have confirmed that the issue is not the battery. Then it works happily again when i do the activation with computer. But sadly i don't have a computer with me when i ride...

This is my second nunchuk, and it functions exactly the same. The previous got kinda broken, because i shorted the regulator and a battery trace burned. I replaced the regulator and all seem to work, it uploads the code without problems. But instead of red light flashing the green is flashing. And obviously it doesn't connect to VESC.

So... What are your experiences with this? Do you need to activate the nunchuk? What does the green LED mean?

My VESC PCB is 4.12 and firmware 2.18.

Where did you get your NRF modules from, China? As far as I remember I also had some weird behaviour. Then I  bought 6 (or more) of the modules and tried until git one which worked fine. The mystery code you found on the elektro-skateboard forum is fine - think there is only error in the LED red/green activation corrected.

Yea, China, through eBay. Those original looking, not blob. And chip says nrf24l01+. But how the NRF modules could affect to this mysterious activation i need to perform?
Anyhow, i just ordered more of those.

While you have a fully functional nunchuk, do you need to activate it the same way i do?
And can you get the original code to work?

Funny, while i'm using the mystery code or the original, all the LED behavior is the same. The pairing is flashing red until solid when it connects.

I need facts, so i don't need to chase unexisting things.

The cheap china ones do not really work. There is a lot of luck involved if you get one working fine straight away.
Benjamin also bought some china clones and they are all in the bin. Just not reliable!

Yep, both codes work fine for me. You can check the differences by comparing the sources. My initial problems where
1. related VESC 4.7, so not of interest for you
2. bad quality nrf24l01 modules - this is not visible from the outside so you just have to try

Setup process:
1. upload the firmware
2. activate nrf in BLDC tool, make sure you set the address correctly, depending on the resistors (bin√§ry coded, 1111 hex = 16 dec) you soldered on the pcb
3. establish connection by pressing c+z button

Don't know everything about the meaning of the LED's is, but what I I know so far is:
- blue LED is used for charging, when the battery is fully charged it blinks slowly
- while connecting, the green LED is blinking, after connecting it's on (in your case ist might be the red since it is assigned not correctly in the original source)

Rpn314: The activating i'm referring is that when there is no power, and i connect the battery, it is still dead, no c+z are working until i connect it to computer. I need to awake the nunchuk with Windows, bldc tool or maybe anything that tries to talk to the nunchuk, except the programming application.

The_Dude, there is no source code for the mystery firmware unfortunately. It would have to be asked from the person who posted it.

Seems that i need to try and see if the nunchuk awakens without computer, when i desolder the NRF module. That's all i can think of.

I desoldered the NRF module, but my problem still persists, i need to "activate" the nunchuk. So it is not related to NRF module any way.
Next thing that i can think of is that if i have some wrong component on board. Something that is related to stm chip booting. I'm using the right BOM, V5.

And i quickly tried that source you posted, it is different than what i found, since it behaves like you said, red and green is swapped. But i need to look more into it.

Maybe your "activation" thought was misleading, when searching for the error. When you connect to a usb-port you also switch to a different power source ... namely your computer! I would really take a closer look to U3 and U4. Is one of them getting hot, you did not swap them accidentally, are the "looking" all right?
```

I just checked them again, and they are the right way. And also smd markings match what they should be. They are not heating. And they look alright.
Power sources are the right way. When i plug USB, the blue LED lights. And the markings are all clear where the battery goes and where USB.

What else i could call it than activation. software power switch triggered by data? :slight_smile: 

When i look at the schematic, it looks that only thing that could be causing this problem would be the USB-bridge. Counterfeight chip with some pins swapped or something... that forces the nunchuk to be in some specific mode on boot... But that doesn't explain why the original code doesn't work and that ws2812 edition works.
But i can test that option by desoldering the USB-bridge off.

EDIT: Yeah! The booting problem(aka. activating) is solved!
I desoldered the CP2102 from the other nunchuk that i thought was broken. I applied power, and i needed to pair it only once, and whenever i connect the battery(actually lab power supply), it is automatically paired! So apparently now it works normal way. Except i can't connect it to computer obviously...

Only two questions remain now... Will the original firmware work now, and were the problem counterfeit CP2102, or just bad soldering.
The soldering appeared to be ok, but i need to wire the chip with thin enameled wire to the pcb so it is 100% every needed pad soldered.

Original firmware works too, just red and green switched. You used a heat gun to solder the grounding underneath the CP2102? If not, you can not connect as you already have experienced. 
Why do you have to use a wire??? Give me a photo!

I soldered it the same way i solder all of the same kind of packages. pre-tinning, flux and heat gun. Including the ground plane.
Wires this time just to make sure all the pads are connected. To confirm if the chip(s) are fake or just bad soldering.

I also had some problems regarding the proper connection of the CP2102, since there are no visible pins, just some sort of corners underneath. After using the heat gun I re-soldered every "pin" with a very fine tin solder and a very, very fine solder tip. After that I had no more problems, connection was good and so far reliable.

Okay, i tested with wires. Exactly the same behavior as before. So the chips are either counterfeit of partially broken.
Here's some pictures.

IC removed, device working perfectly:

EDIT: So far it is working good.
Now i have another problem, longboard battery died, i need to wait for new batteries to arrive. The current cells are already bad, used for testing purposes, to be replaced with better ones. But that's another story.

But about the CP2102. What i have read on internet, the problem may be related to RTS and DTR pins. What i'll try, is to control those two pins with switches and see what happens.
EDIT: Okay. When i disconnect the RTS signal, it starts working. So i need just one switch for RTS.

EDIT: The original firmware is still not working...

Are you compiling the newest version from Benjamins github? I think he has changed some pieces in the software (using STM32s ID) in his last commit.
I would try the software before that last commit. Maybe that will work for you.

Yea, newest from github.
Now i had the time to compare those sources. The difference (most likely) why they are not working straight away is that some values on rf.c are different and need to be changed on BLDC Tool.
Newest --- other version:
NRF_RETR_DELAY_1000US --- NRF_RETR_DELAY_250US
NRF_SPEED_2M --- NRF_SPEED_250K

I don't have now time to test those settings, but some day next week i will.

@Quezacotl Do a full revert back to the pre-December 2016 version. He changed a lot more than the speed and delay settings. Vedder also added some capability to have the nunchuck auto-pair with a VESC (even changed the communication packet/protocol on it) but the VESC code does not have any similar features that I am aware of (so I suspect this is a feature we'll only see in the VESC6). This change also means that the resistors are not longer used to make the address, so the 198.199.(resisotr binary values) we've been using don't work. He completely deleted that code.

Now i soldered a presumably genuine CP2102 chip. I ordered it from Mouser when i got some other parts aswell.
The "activation" problem i was talking earlier still exists. So the problem is not in the USB chip.
I have made even a third remote, which has the same problem.
I have confirmed that all the components have right values, and they are on right places.
Still the only "solution" i have is to put a switch between BOOT0-signal.

Yea, very strange problem. I need to inspect carefully every single part including the PCB next time i bother to dig into this again.

But today i noticed that while the BOOT0 signal is cut, the databridge works still through BLDC-tool. I didn't even test that feature when i saw that programming won't work. I just assumed that databridge wouldn't work either.
So actually the BOOT0-signal is only for programming.
