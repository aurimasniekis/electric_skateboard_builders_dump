Hello.  I built my friend a Esk8 about 4 months ago using a focbox I had laying around from the last black friday sale. He just gave it back to me saying it was cutting out every now and again.  I found I was getting ABS over current errors so I changed some of the settings and raised the max burst current and it went away.  last week however He gave it back saying it has the same problem again.    I put it onto my bench and now im getting UnderVoltage errors as well as a DVR error.   Something is telling me this isnt normal as the battery is brand new (as he killed the last 3 some how) and the DVR is definitely new.

Any tips or is it time to send it in to repair.
If it does need repairing.  Where can I get it repaired in the Uk/Eu as I kinda dont want to ship it to the Us.

@notepad

Have you purchased it from Enertion directly?

What are the Setup specs?
Can we have the images of the PCB?
