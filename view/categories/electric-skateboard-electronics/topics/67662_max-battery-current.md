So I have two 3s 5000mah 20C lipos in series and I am starting to configure my vesc. I also have a 260kv motor from torque boards. I was wondering what I should set my max battery current at to optimize performance.

30a is a safe bet.

Yep I agree with this, Iâ€™d go for 30a/-10 batt and 55/-55 motor to start with
