Hey, so i bought a 6s bms and on the balance leads I have only 6 wires instead of 7. I have heard that the bms uses the ground from the main leads.

Can anyone help me to wire it correctly? Here is the diagram for the bms(I am bypassing the discharging)

I guess you manually have to add the B- wire to the plug. Can you give photos of the plugs you have?

You have male /  female 7 wire plugs? But only six wires on which side?

There is a 5s which appears to have the same model name for some dumb, dumb reason, make sure that is not what you have.

The 6s one should have 7 pins like this and just like the pcb markings say B- goes to the negative terminal of the battery, the B1-B5 pins go to each series postive

Hmm, right now I left the - pin out, considering that it is actually already connected to the bms via the main cables and the batteries are charging. Maybe the bms uses the negative from the main black cable of the battery?
