The motor shaft that is supposed to spin the motor pulley spins freely no matter how tight I get the motor pulley. It spins fine without weight, but as soon as I stand on it it'll spin without spinning the wheel.

If the shaft and pulley support a key use that. if not drill notch on the pulley for a grub/set screw or file the shaft down flat on one side for one

I filed it down got it mounted back up, plugged the motor back in. Now the motor won't spin like its not receiving power.

Did you make shure that the metal shavings from the motor shaft, didn't go in to the stator ?

Motor works now, I got it out and testing it now. The brakes are almost non-existent, is that normal?
