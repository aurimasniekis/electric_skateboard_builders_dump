3V/cell or 30V

3V seems allready very low.

most people here go with 3.3 - 3.2V tops

i want to be safe but also i want to get the most out of my battery.
would it still be the same.

liion or lipo?

are we talking about LiPo's or Li-Ion's?

```
then 3.4V to get the most out of them. 3.2 is allready borderline for them in terms of max charge cycles
```

```
lower limit for lipos seem to be 3.2v to be safe and preserve longevity.

but, this is from my 10s balance charger manual:

or what @Achmed20 said
```

## \#12 Posted by: dg798 Posted at: 2017-07-28T21:02:53.736Z Reads: 229

```
so 32v in total is good for maximum preformance and to also conserve the energy?
```

```
i run mine down to 3.2V btw.
replacing them costs me like 60â‚¬ but i usualy have 40% left after a ride.

i don't feel comfortable advising on lipos, i've personally never used them.

i would go with a more conservative bottom cutoff at 3.4v, so 34v for your 10s pack, like @Achmed20 said. 

not sure about "maximum performance and to also conserve the energy."  it's more to extend the life of your batteries because draining them to their extremes is a great way to kill them prematurely.  and lipos are volatile in general so good to be conservative.

there's peopel here using lipos very successfully, may want to ask them (@Namasaki comes to kind).

so what kind of battery would you recommend

If your gonna use Lipos, then I highly recommend getting Lipos with a high C rating.
I've been using 60/120C Lipos for long time and they are doing very well.

Hey guys just wanna run something by the more knowledgeable members, if a lipo fully charged is 4.2v and fully discharged is 3v, running a 10s8p 20c 40 000mah battery would I be better off setting my cut off to 3.2 or 3.3? I will already have a huge range I just want to preserve cycle and charge life of my batteries

set cutoff start to 34 and end to 32

So 32 is safe for my batteries to maximize range and power with a healthy battery charge life?

the chances that you'll run them that low is very slim.  the best way to increase the amount of charge cycles is to charge to 41v instead of 42v, that will double them and make up for discharging them "low" every now and then

Perfect, by those numbers my board will hit 65 km at full charge 41 and 50km at 32 @GrecoMan with only 16/32 gearing. Faster if I go to 20/32

cool :smile:

the 1v that you don't charge is only equal to about 5% of your actual "juice" since at that voltage, it will deplete way quicker than at 3.7ish when it evens out

I think 16/32 will be a good place to start I will give an update when I have more parts

16/32 is much better than 20/32.

I personally use 16/36 on 97mm wheels
