Hello All,
I am having an issue with my eMTB and the range I am getting. I live in Seattle but have been taking relatively flat routes and my range is pretty bad. I have a 12s 8p pack using 25r cells. Dual FOC Box, TB 6374 motors and NESE modules for the battery pack. I had all my tires at 40PSI and have a double helical gear drive from @Nowind. On a 4.3 mile route I lost 16% off the top end of my batteries. This means my range is shy of 25 miles which seems quite short for such a large battery pack. Any insight? I have reassembled the drives to make sure alignment and mesh is right.

Have you tried to actually fully drain your battery in one go? These cheap battery meters works by measuring voltage of battery pack, and as you probably know, batteries drop quite fast in voltage to around 4v/cell. I myself have found these cheap ones to be very inaccurate.. You sould do a full range test, and then see how far you got.

Can you check the resistance of your bridges and your leads?  Sometimes if the gage and resistance is to high your batteries will drain really fast because of the area it has to push current.

@hyperIon1  So you want the resistance of the "bus bars" and then the resistance between the terminals of the NESE modules or the individual cells?

Yes, that would have significant impact on the performance of the pack regardless what you had in parallel a 12s8p should give you 40-50 mile range in that configuration. Even with 25r cells. 
Are the cells new?

I do apologize, I do not work with the NESE system. But we do make flat packs for esk8. 
We have used the 25r 20a before and the reason I ask is that in building this way NESE the resistance must be a lot. We have found a sweet spot in the size of nickel strip to the gage of wire to achieve the most the battery pack can give. 
Sometimes bigger isn’t better.

A resistance of NESE or any other not welded battery packs will be huge compared to normal welding connections. As metals produces oxides which increase resistance and other factors as not hard enough contact and etc, if you point Flir camera to your pack while riding I would guarantee every connection point will shine :) Also helical gears are not very efficient compared to plain spur gears :)

NESE uses tin coated copper which has much lower resistance when compared to the regularly used nickel tabs. When tightened nicely, it should have negligible resistance.To loose 30% of the energy to heat would mean that the busbar and other contact points would be too hot to touch. If you have a thermal camera, it can give you a nice idea of how hot it gets.

Honestly, I would do the following:
1. Charge a single cell and see what is the capacity from fully charged to drained to see if your cells are healthy.
2. Measure the voltage of each parallel group after your VESC/BMS doesn't work any more. If all the parallel groups are at same voltage then it's all good, but if one or 2 groups's voltage is significantly lower than the rest then you have found the parallel group with bad cells. You just replace the cells for that group only.

Also is 40PSI the max you can go on those pnummies? I have heard people using 70PSI to get good range.

Okay, so relative to each other the parallel groups are good.

Yeah, that's what I do to check if cells are original or not, charge them to full and discharge them to 3.1 volts or so and check the total mAh discharged.

Also I would suggest to raise the pressure to 50PSI and do your range test?

At 50psi the range calculates to 31 miles which is on the low end of acceptable. It should probably be closer to 35-37

If you have a thermal camera, you can probably have a 4S setup(just to show a few modules in series), draw 100A from the whole system and show the temperature reading of the hot points. It might dispel some misconception people might have regarding these modules.

I have compression foam to account for any tolerances that might exist on 3d printed part <300um and then there is not much that can influence resistance "hugely" as you put. I have tested compression forces at various temps and they are significant compared to what you might think, say remote controller and spring type. I can guaranty that resistance will be lower than any spotwelded module of the same size and I dont guaranty stuff easily.

I don't need that. Thermal camera is a thermometer. I have measured temps soon after test and if you saw Jehu Garcia's powerwall modules they pulled and tested where conections were glowing, you would see quiet opposite in NESE modules. Cells would glow and tabs would not. I had plans on getting cheap thermos cam but bought tires for my car instead :smiley: Bugger
I still might get it for the winter. Its a good visual tool.

If you're so sure, you should send some to a forum member and let them put 500 miles on it and write an unbiased public review of it.  Electric longboards have a funny way of breaking things.

Also, you do look like that after a 20 mile ride.  Just so we're clear.

@Trdolan03. I have no experience on eboards but my diy scooter has 12S1P A123 20AH pack. I am running maxxis hookworms on high pressure. I get same mileage as you do, around 45km (28miles).
I guess it is just the efficiency of the vehicle unless these boards get higher mileage than bikes.
Is there any setup that is similar to yours to compare?

@Nowind Have you had problems like this with your helical drives before?

As you say by yourself the gear drives freewheel better then the beltdrive of your friend so i dont see the problem on my drives isnt it?

I only get 35wh per mile and there is nothing wrong with my setup.
Dual 4.10 vesc, 2x6374 sk3, 12s lipo, 150mm wheels 40psi, 15/80, 15mm belts with idlers, 70kg rider.

Id say the biggest waste of energy on mine is the belts and pulleys.

Well the biggest loss, I would say, is from the tires, not pulley and belt. Imagine how hard is it to push a bike which is barely pressurized. Same for the motors too. Higher pressure = less loss. 

Basically when the wheel rolls, the tire constantly deforms and then snaps back to it's circular shape. This requires energy. More the deformation, the better the quality of ride but worse is the efficiency. Urethane wheels are very efficient just because they are pretty stiff and don't deform as much.

You can read more about it here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance

Yep, but it would depend on the terrain. I dont think a urethane wheel would fair well efficiency wise on the fields and tracks i belt across lol.

I have around 38,4wh/m (24wh/km) when running 30psi on my board. If I go up to 70psi My wh/km goes down to around 19wh/km.

Try higher tire pressures and lower your max A settings to say 40A on each motor. Even though I ride with 70A per motor on my board and rarely give full throttle. If I lower it to 40A and give it full throttle every time I want to reach cruise speed. The wh/km is usally 2-4 wh/km lower than with more power available.

I'm just gonna start calling everything direct drive, using the logic that I will **direct** my foot up anyone's ass that tries to **drive** my board.  In fact, I had direct drive toast this morning with my direct drive coffee.  I about to go take a direct drive piss and then sneak off for a direct drive cigar in the not so direct drive parking lot :slight_smile:.

Next thing you know, bananas at the store will say "direct drive" on them, not because it means anything, but because it *increases dem sales figures, yo $$$*

Direct drive is a hub motor. If you use belt its either single or dual stage or etc drive

hey, I’m looking at using those packs right now at 12s1p config Too. Do you know what’s the discharge rate on them? Thanks!

I dont know what you mean by 12S1P as i have P modules starting at 2P up to 8P but tested continuous current stands ar ~200A per 6P or, lets round it up, 30A per cell. Just a reminder that there is no cell on the market that can do that continously without liquid cooling.
You should visit NESE thread and continue there, not to trash this one ;)

If you noted  i stated the cell, A123 20AH AMP20 cells with my kit i no longer produce. It has nothing to do with OP's battery or modules i produce now for 18650 cell format. You can read on previous kit here: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=38545&hilit=A123+amp20+kit

Around the 25Wh/Mi range is good for pneumatics, have seen people getting that on thane

I get like 30wh mile on thane!
