I burnt out the FETs on my antispark switch. Where do you guys get replacement FETs without paying out the ass for shipping? (and also actually has them in stock, lol)

I do believe there was another post about this exact topic not to long ago so I do recommend you try to use the search function of the forum before posting. Anyways it depends what parts your looking for but Mouser, Digikey and Arrow are all good places, Arrow has free shipping as well. Also when replacing the MOSFET's it's reccomended that you replace all the FET's at the same time.
