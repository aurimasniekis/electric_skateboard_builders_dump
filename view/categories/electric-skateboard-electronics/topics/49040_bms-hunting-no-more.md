**Hold onto your brain buckets folks.**
So here's the thing, if you have a dumb BMS(no IC,nothing fancy) like the D122, D140, D190 etc, you can use for instance a 12S BMS on lower S counts. ü§Ø
They work on a per series basis, the actual total voltage is irrelevant for it to function. So if you take a 12S BMS and wire an 11S battery and charge to 11S voltage. **IT WORKS**

I've tested this on the 12S D122 on my 11S
I'll be testing the 12S D140 tomorrow on a 10S battery

I wanna buy up as many BMS as I can find to test this functionality on, if you wanna contribute to the effort, my PayPal cyberonu@gmail.com

Yep...I've done this a few times before... Even wired dumb 3s & 4s BMS together to make a 12s :P just share some balance leads that need to be shared between the bms and you can. Have a multi part pack... That takes up far less BMS space..

Well every balance lead except B- and B+ is really a ¬± 

Let's take 3s bms's.  Cell 3 balance lead needs to share b- balance lead of the next group. Which technically happens because of the series connection. B- of each group must be connected.  Ie cells 1-3 group cell 1 connected to b- of BMS 1. Cell 4-6 cell 4 connected to b- of bms2. Etc. B- is the ground and no balance functions will work without it connected on most dumb BMS

To charge -ch on BMS one to charger negative. Charger positive to end of pack b+(not group b+)

It's the same principal as taking 2 5S batteries and combining into 10S

BMS 1
B-, b1+,b2+,b3+,b4+,b5+

BMS 2
b5+ from BMS 1 goes to B- of BMS 2
Then continue, b6+,b7+,b8+,b9+,b10+

Use Charge negative from BMS 2

This is going to sound stupid but how are the cells connected to bms 1 charged?
```

---
## \#24 Posted by: scepterr Posted at: 2018-03-14T09:19:04.213Z Reads: 184

```
Because b5+ from BMS 1 is connected to B- of BMS 2, that's the link
You can either run 2 leads from b5+, one to b5+ of BMS 1 and one to B- of BMS 2 or run a lead from b5+ on BMS 1 itself  to BMS 2 B-

Actually wait I might get this shit. When I get home in 5 I‚Äôll draw a diagram of how I understand it and post it here, could you just tell me if it‚Äôs correct?

Lord Jesus Christ please help me to not be so stupid next time lol. I know exactly why now. I have the two bms modules the wrong way. Which means that it is only charging the first 5 cells and not the others. So if I was to connect the other bms to the charge port that would send voltage through all 10 cells?

You have it connected correctly just drawn in reverse, regardless, yes

Ok thanks for all this help, hopefully this helps somebody else to connect their cells with a bms in series. The worst part about all of this is it makes doing it your way with just one less balance lead so much more tempting, haha. 

Here is the final and wrong diagram...lol

Ok, I kinda get it. So somehow the negative charge from the charger passes through c- on bms 2, then out b- and into b5 on bms 1, and then out of b- on bms 1 and into the battery. I think I might just be over complicating it by trying to picture the flow of electrons

Once completed and go for a little test spin,  it'll come to you.

on that note tho there aren't a lot of elegant type names out there for boards...
Example
"ZOO Lyn" carver     (combination of Zoo York & Brooklyn) i would expect clean smooth flowing lines maybe even with some lighter/softer shades of running lights, like an angel floating down the street.
or
could be a take from Wu-Tang, shaolin ninja style C.R.E.A.M.

EDIT; the board with the search light on it would represent "follow the light  or Run away from the light" as often described with out of body experiences.

Then likely either -c will work as the only purpose is to cut off the charge at the end. -c is normally a shared pad of -b with a ic switch to break the shared ground. 

I was under the assumption if you have the charger positive on cell 10 and the -c effectively on 6 negative(2nd -b shared with -c) the charge current would be passing down to the common ground and current only going to half the pack, and the BMS balancing the current to the lower cells.

With -c on the first BMS...the common ground is cell 1 negative. So current goes through the entire pack vs only half way...and no voltage mismatch..

Can you do me a favor and multimeter from your BMS 2 -c and the total pack b+. I would expect to only see 21v~  @scepterr
