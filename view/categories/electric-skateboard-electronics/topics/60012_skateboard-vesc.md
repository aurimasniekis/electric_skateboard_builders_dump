areostar 50A

to my understanding it's an aircraft esc with reverse function. No brakes... Never heard of braking planes/helis/quads. It's also not a V-esc, but it's a ESC. the V makes all the difference: it stays for Vedder-ESC, it's inventor, is a programmable ESC made for electric vehicles and I can only recommend it.

The best for that price is a Xcar beast esc or fvt 120a but they have screechy brakes and can only handle up to 6s
