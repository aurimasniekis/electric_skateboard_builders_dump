Hi all,

I just built up a board and got to spending some quality time with it. I was wondering how I can go about connecting to the Wiiciever to have a look at the code and possibly tweak it. The delay/sporadicness of the braking concerns me. Anyone else have this problem? 

P.S. Im running a FVT120A esc with the eboard firmware.

```
The code is on [github](https://github.com/jaustindavid/wiiceiver), go and check it out. I also have some problem with braking but I fixed it by programming the braking force on my ESC from 80% to 40%. ( did it with a programming card)
