Hi guys...
I bought a Maytech VESC few days ago from APS...when i connected all together, there was just blue led blinking, i tried everything possible to get it working...my friend (IT guy) uploaded all frimware and did everything to get it to work, but it still doesnt....still tehre is just a blue led blinking...My friend followed all instructions released by VEDDER and the firmware should be OK, but the VESC still doesnt connect to BLDC...

Do you know where the problem might be?
