So i got a battery pack of Craigslist for cheap, 60 for 40$, they looked in fairly good condition and i wanted to see if i could repurpose them. The label says SE US18650V T V112XTA19G (Sony, but i can't find the specific model). Heres a pic<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/8/b87ea2c4b740f3d636bf32a79db797b77e86a9ce.jpg" width="298" height="531">
Any help in identifying would be greatly appreciated.

Yeah, good for a power bank and not much else. Low discharge, low capacity. Probably old stock too, so they probably don't even hit 1600mah.

Wait, according to [this link](http://www.dampfakkus.de/akkutest.php?id=78) they can push up to 20A, but still tiny capacity  . .. 1.6Ah

"measured at 2A to 3V	1443mAh"

At 20A you would get a few minutes of use..maybe lol
10% loss at 2A

Tip: Avoid having your board burn to the ground.
 Don't buy batteries for Eboard on eBay.
Get them from a reputable company like
https://liionwholesale.com/search?type=product&q=sony

yeah, i figured for 40$ they were not gunna be amazing, but the guy said he had no idea what they were from or anything about them, figured it might be worth it, came out to 0.75 canadian pesos per cell. Liion wholesale is where im planning to get Samsung 30q;s for my 12S4P build.

Stick with Liionwholesale.
I ordered a bunch of batteries from them once. They shipped them in a priority mail envelope.
The envelope was delivered by the mail man torn and empty. Someone at the post office prob stole the batteries for their vape mod. they where 26650's
I called liionwholesale and told them and they just shipped another batch of batteries to me on the spot.

Also, any idea where i can get a good BMS, i wanted a Bestech, but it;s kinda steep to buy 2, money is kinda strapped (slightly over budget on this build :stuck_out_tongue:)
