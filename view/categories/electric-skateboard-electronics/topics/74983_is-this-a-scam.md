So I have been in search of cheap Li-Po Cells for my parts list that I will use for my E-Board. I came across these.

I really don’t see what’s so bad about looking into them. Most likely once contacting the supplier the price will be $100 or more. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were reasonable batteries you just never know. 

Like I said above I wouldn’t put it into my board but for some fun and mucking around or testing shit I’m sure it would be fine, we’ll thats if it’s a legit battery

Exactly like why the heck not. If they work or if you even get them well you’ve got a nice portable 24v power supply

It’s not like you can just click and buy it for $1. You have to talk to them and negotiate a price. 

Alibaba VS AliExpress

Lol I went into this post thinking someone would be asking if a $100 esk8 battery was a scam or something like that... I didn't expect someone asking about a battery that was literally less than a fucking dollar!

alieexpress do this shit all the time.  You contact supplier and they tell you the correct price or the minimum order quantity.  Its to establish said contact.  Then they bomb your email with all kinds of random crap.
