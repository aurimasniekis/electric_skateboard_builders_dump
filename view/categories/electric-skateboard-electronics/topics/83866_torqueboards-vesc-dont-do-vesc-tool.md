So I had TorqueBoard vesc for a while absolutely no complain. Then I saw the new VESC TOOL and I update the firmware according to the program suggested. Go through all the configuration and getting to the FOC setting tab, I click the lamba button to make the motor run but instead of running I heard a loud pop. Felt the vesc and it's pretty hot. Burn residue around the IRFS mosfet thingy close to the **red wire**.. ![IMG_2224|375x500](upload://wqKdbNjUtGLx856sHHE65iG5IF8.jpeg) ![IMG_2225|375x500](upload://jPBLbua0Exjgzmnl9qr0cSygI1k.jpeg) 

My plan as of right now is checking whether if the mosfet is burn or anything is burn so I can replace it. If anyone can guide me, I would  really appreciate it.
