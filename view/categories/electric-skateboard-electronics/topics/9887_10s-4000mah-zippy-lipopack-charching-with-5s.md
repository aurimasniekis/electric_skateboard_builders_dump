Short question to a Zippy 10s 4000mAh Akkupack

I want to charge my Akkupack with a 5s Charger 
IÂ´m right when i solder an kabel, like in the picture
and connect pin 1 ,2 and 3 to the charger for the fist 5 blocks to charge and 2 ,3 and 5 for the last 5 blocks ? Or do i need to cutoff the packs while loading ?
