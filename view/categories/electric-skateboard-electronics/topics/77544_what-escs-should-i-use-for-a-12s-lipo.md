Looking to create a dual drive 12s setup (2 6s 5000mah 25c) but am finding it hard to pick a pair of ESC. Some sources say that the VESC cannot handle 12s lipos. Is this true? What other options do I have then. And when it comes to dual escs has anyone tried this one: https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/dual-fsesc4-12-100a 

When it says '100A dual' does that mean each ESC can pull 100A or each can only puppy 50?

Thanks so much in advance 

(PS if any one of you know builds with a similar power pack please link them here. I'd like to know what housing options they've used, BMS and range they got on their boards)

Your questions answered by reading the specs you added to your post.
All vesc Derivats work with 12s.
Some more reliable, some less.
If the producer recommends a 10s use, than there is a reason for it üòâ

If you want to see builds with similar battery than you plan to use than just use the search function.
You definitely not the only one in here with a 12s 5Ah lipo battery.

this guy is talking about flipsky and you go on and say that?

Did you hear how flipsky dual 4.20s preform with higher settings?

Man I can't think of a worse vesc than the one you linked for your use case.
For me at 12s It's either Ollen-vescs or Enetrion vesc-x's (which you can't buy directly from Enertion anymore)

Now I'm not recommending anyone go the 12s route but If i would I'd only use those esc's at this time.

If you wanna be a bit more safe then you could maybe go for a dual receiver setup
(that way if 1 esc fails your remote will still have control and handle the other.)

'Some less' leaves a lot to be imagined and when someone posts about 12s lipo and a dual 4.20 i'm just like :man_facepalming:

Look man what if you thought esc's were simple *Hey look it works on 12's Simple!*
*I'll just make a post to be extra safe*

would you like someone to tell you

Why don't you recommend the 12s route? Are they that much of an overkill?

You need to know what your doing with 12s.
and @Skunk makes a great point.


Like if you can't debate why 12s is good then you proberbly shouldn't run 12s.

Adding extra capacitors is a great way to reduce voltage spikes that can kill the vesc

That being said i still went 12s first build.
But 12s is not necessary.  10s is still a good build. My next build will probably be 10s.

Out of curiosity, why don't you use vesc 4.12? Are they incompatible with 12s packs?

You should look it up in search as others have said.
And you've been warned about that Flipsky vesc you linked.

and my advice I give again ollen vesc's there good.
If there a bit pricey then focbox's are the next best thing.

There are other options but you should do your research.

Even a 4.20 is working with 12s... you just have cut outs from time to time... but theoretically it‚Äôs working with 12s... 
i wouldn‚Äôt recommend it, but ...

I have used cheap 50a Maytech VESC and 12s Lipo no problem.
Except for that one time it dropped out and I landed hard. 
No problem since
I am having more problems with a 10s on focboxs setup than the 12s. But the source of the issue is yet to be found. So doesn't really count. Yet I could say, it is the problem because both my first and second "builds" were 12s with fewer issues.

 I had a look at the 12s issues mentioned here on the forum. Wasn't sure if there was any concrete evidence 12s was the problem.

:man_facepalming:

Only in Russia where driving licencees cost less than 50 bucks and the cops require tips.
don't tell me your cars don't have to go thorough a technical test.

OK I get it man It works according to your Russian standards but aren't you German?

the driving license is actually 500$ and i¬¥m sure you wouldn¬¥t pass the practical part of it.... not because of you :thinking:...ok maybe because of you... :sweat_smile:
cars have a technical test and without that and an ensurance you can¬¥t drive here on any roads.

If you can¬¥t read one post in full length than i would highly recommend you to jump up to the top of this thread.
take your time. have a break. than read again.
maybe one day you will understand that i never said that the flipsky dual should be used with 12s...not after russian and also not after german standards.
reading and connecting information out of two comments is something not so easy for the one or the other... 
but don¬¥t worry one day you will grown up too!

Don't BS me I'm part Russian and have family there but I guess your like some tourist who doesn't understand or see what's happening around him. 

and like any part Russian kido I already drove a car and its soo easy. (Ps it was automatic if it was manual i'd have a slightly harder time.)

you always welcome to come here as tourist and speak with locals about the license prices.
as you partitial russian, that shouldn¬¥t be an issue for you.
i even have a nice lada staying in front of my door.
if you want we can have a ride together here in the city, in the winter...let¬¥s see how long it will take till your pans get wet ;)
