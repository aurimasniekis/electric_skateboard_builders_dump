Hi, 
I was planning on using a Turnigy VESC with a KEDA 190KV motor. The VESC says 50A continuous and around 250A burst but the KEDA says it's 80A. Is this a problem? If this won't work, is there an alternative motor which needs less current? I'm planning on running at 8s

The Keda is a good motor... plenty of oomff with a single VESC setup. I am running 12s though!
