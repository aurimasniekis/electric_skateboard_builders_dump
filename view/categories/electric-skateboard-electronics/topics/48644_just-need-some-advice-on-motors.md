Hi just need advice on which motor to buy, I plan to build the eboard with a 10s2p battery made from Samsung 25r5 cells and is 42 volts fully charged. I want to run that through a vesc and into the motor. I want to go upwards of 30km/h (18mph). will be running 83mm wheels so should be heaps of room

190kv motor
Gearing 15/36

Look at the motor section in this thread
Maytech 190kv motors also seem to be a good choice. Don't be fooled by marketing and do not buy the enertion motor. Other cheaper ones do just fine.

Your going to need at least a 10s3p to hit 18mph, maybe 4p unless you get 30q cells.  83mm wheels are doable, ive got a board that runs 80mm kegels, but 90mm or bigger are best for your daily driver.  I'd look at [Popoca's](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/ollin-popoca-longboard-wheels-90mm-78a).

On to motors...for a single motor build a 6374 190-200kv is best, gives you plenty of torque and speed.  You can get a 6274 from [BKB](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/motors/products/6374-190kv-motor) or [TorqueBoards](collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv) pretty cheap.  Also, @bimmer has some choice [6374](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-6374-with-hall-sensors-and-reinforced-mounting-side/48635)'s (at least they seem so to me) for sale right now.

Don't forget about a remote, enclosure, motor mount, wire and connectors, charger, etc.
