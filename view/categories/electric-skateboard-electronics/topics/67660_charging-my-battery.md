I have a Chi 10s2p battery. After each use of my battery is down to 70 or 60% should I recharge it then?.  Does it do any damage to the battery to leave it half charged? Should I always have it charged fully?

Nooo, you want at full charge for the minimum amount of time as possible. Store 40-60% only charge it just before using it if your goal is maximum battery life.
