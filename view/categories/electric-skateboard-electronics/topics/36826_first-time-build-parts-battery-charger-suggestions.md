Hi! This is my going to be my first build and I need help deciding on my batteries and charger. I am 125 pounds and want to go ~25 mph with around 10+ miles of range. I already researched most of my parts and need help deciding on batteries (probably LiPos), I read this [post](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-is-battery-c-rating-is-it-important-for-electric-skateboards/36?source_topic_id=215) by @onloop about batteries and have some idea but can't decide on what specific batteries I want to use.  **Here's the parts, tell me what you guys think**::blush:

If you have used these parts before, please share your experience? Budget is ~$850 for deck and electronics!


**BOARD:**
**Deck:** Loaded Icarus

**Wheels** Orangatang Kegel 80 mm (80a Orange)
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074XGYP4S/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=AQ5JN7IFU4T3S&psc=1

**Trucks** Caliber Trucks Cal II 50Â°
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0719BXH7G/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?smid=AQ5JN7IFU4T3S&psc=1 

**Bushings** Orangatang Nipples (Soft/Orange) 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009K6LY0K/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=AQ5JN7IFU4T3S&psc=1

**Bearings**
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDRQ1S/ref=ox_sc_act_title_5?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1

**MECHANICAL PARTS:**
**Pulley/Belt**: Might  buy a few spare belts from this website.
collections/electric-skateboard-pulley-belt-combo-kits/products/36t-kegel-pulley-combo-kit
collections/electric-skateboard-motor-mounts/products/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-set-only-black

**ELECTRONICS:**

**VESC**: Has anyone had problems with Ollin Board's VESC by @chaka?  I've heard they are worth the higher price and have and that they have excellent customer service. 
http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/vedder-s-speed-controller

**Motor**: Again, has anyone had any problems with this?
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-5055-280kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?___store=en_us
**Remote/Reciever**: TorqueBoards remote or the Nano-X from Enertion, thought the Enertion remote is more pricey at ~$100 (40 dollars more, worth?).
collections/remote-controller/products/torqueboards-2-4ghz-nano-remote-controller
 
**or**
http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/nano-x-enertion-2-4ghz-controller/

**BATTERIES: NEED SUGGESTIONS!!!**


**CHARGERS**: Can anyone link to single plug charging solutions for batteries connected in series? And how to wire a battery percentage indicator?

I might have missed it, but what Voltage do you want to run?

How many cells are you looking at doing. I don't have any experience with ollin vesc but have heard nothing but good things.  You want to make sure that your vesc motor and batteries are all compatible I would say they are but you want to make sure also are you doing a single motor?

@MrHappy I'm not sure, any suggestions in terms of voltage?

@briman05 Correct, I will be using a single motor for now, as it only needs 1 VESC. I might upgrade in the future, who knows.

6s 8s or 10s. You choose, the higher the s count, the higher the top speed is.

@MrHappy I think I might wire two 5S Batteries in series for 10S total?

Well the 2 5s in series will only make it a 10s with what ever mah the batteries are so you would need it atleast 3 with one in parallel to increase the mah to get 10 miles

If you are going to use 10s you will need a lower kv motor. 190kv is perfect for 10s

Dont go for that motor. Its only a 5055. If you are settle on 10s, go for the sk3 6374 192 for raw power, or a sensored 6374 from diy or similar

I would recommend focbox. My friend bought the DIY vesc and the DRV fried on a bench test. Focbox has DRV protection, DIY's has not

Yep lots of people have problems with the DIY vescs. Including myself, I fried my DRV but because I was trying to run FOC. He will likely be fine in BLDC mode

I suggest you go with 18650 batteries. Lipo is a pain in the ass to charge, I own SIX so I know. Buy Battery Management System for your battery with an on/off switch so you don't have to plug and unplug. You need to cut down your cost because I'll tell you this. Your budget right now. Be prepare to spend TWICE the amount. 
Turnigy's motor mount for example. Wheels can be fly wheels instead. Remote control can be cheaper too. Need threadlock for to prevent your screw front vibration.

They look similiar, so they probably work similar.

I'm a fan of LiPos but I use them for my quads too so the charging regimen is something I'm used to 5S 5Ah 2 in series gives you 10S 5Ah or 185Wh (5Ah * 37V [nominal voltage] = 185Wh).  The Wh tells you total energy in the battery and tells you roughly the distance you can expect to get, on a given setup if you double the Wh you double the distance, as a rough estimate 10Wh = 1km = .6miles (you will get more or less depending on exact efficiency of everything).

^^ can see my enclosure here made so I can pull the 5S batteries out and charge them but anyhow can get an idea of how big that brick of lipos is the enclosure doesn't have much wiggle room inside and is only a few mm thick.

@gee 
I don't want to solder my own battery pack and the prebuilt 18650 packs are really expensive. What do you mean I will spend twice the amount? The only part I feel I might need to spend more on right now is my motor (like you mentioned).

That is just an assumption, do you have any sources to back that up?

Thanks, I'll get two 5000 mah batteries in series for 10s to get about 16 km range.

use a 63mm motor 200kv or less!!
6355 is plenty of power at your weight.

Well you can stick with lipo but you gotta get BMS and an on/off switch. TRUST ME. Try to cut the cost of your wheels, deck and bushings.

Like @gee said you can cut cost in other places.  Loaded boards are very nice but they are a hell of a lot more then other companies like Jet, Earthwing , Original or even Landyacht.  Sector9 has some nice boards they are super mass produced but alot of people start skating on them because they are cheaper.  Hell there are some custom board companies that dont even charge that much for the deck alone.  I do my own boards and have start a small side business for custom boards not plugging my own brand but if you look around on muirskate you can find some nice decks for alot less.

Yeah a bms and off switch make your life a lot easier. Also don't go too cheap on the wheels and trucks youll probably regret it later. Some cheap trucks are too loose and you will wobble at high speeds and cheap wheels wear and will make your ride insanely bumpy.
