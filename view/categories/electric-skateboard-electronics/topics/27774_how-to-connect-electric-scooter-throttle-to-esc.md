Hello,
I am building electric scooter and I'm not sure how to connect electric scooter throttle to 80A (5-12S) ESC... Do I just connect it or...?

The easiest way is to use servo tester ie. https://i.stack.imgur.com/aRn9j.jpg
But You will have to use soldering iron to make it work...

There are instructions how to. One more thing: you will probably need to jumpwire both grounds from removed potentiometer.

Don't use that ESC, it is meant for drones so the braking and acceleration will be off.

Maybe a 120A FVT Esc? Anything other then a boat or hell esc should be good.

I have a question, do these electric throttle rotate on both sides, one for acceleration, other for brake . or is it only acceleration?

thanks
