I have this bms wired with my 12s5p battery, unfortunately I have a few reasons for changing it. Is there a bms that would work "plug &play" ? With the only soldering needed with charge port, LCD and IN & OUT.  I would like to bypass the bms and only use it for charging. Also I would like a smaller one. Will be using push to start switch with it. Many thanks!![IMG_20180812_105713|374x500](upload://y42rD8aq4mrTKUs23Ymyz4J9RmF.jpg)

They're all soldered like that one yeah, but some use different pin connectors for the 10/11 cables which can cause troubles. Is the enclosure too thin to fold it over the battery with some neoprene?

Way way too thin, I can either stick with this one till it gives up, or change to a new small one while I'm rebuilding my board.
