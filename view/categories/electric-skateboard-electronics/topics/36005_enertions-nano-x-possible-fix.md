Okay so first off, the Enertion Nano-X controller is a pretty good remote. A while ago I lost it, found it, then dropped it and now it turn on. Around 10 minutes ago I put it on the charger just to see what would happen and the red blinking light turned on which is good in my opinion (at least it works lmao). I just opened it up and saw that the battery's red wire is separated from the circuit board. The upside about this is it's very fixable, but the downside is I have barely any skills with soldering, and If i do solder it I'm afraid it won't be good enough and break again in mid ride. I did solder one of those mini kits before and there were no problems with it, but I at least could mess that up lol. Should i go for it?

So yeah tell me what you think, should I risk it and solder it? It doesn't look that hard to solder.

I would definitely do it yourself as long as you have basic soldering skills.

Had the same issue.  Super easy fix.  I recommend adding some nice double sided tape and not the cheesy stuff the original battery comes with.

Okay everyone! It works now (I’m excited). The solder job is kinda messy but it doesn’t touch any other pins, I already tested it, and I made sure to angle the wire so it wouldn’t accidentally touch any other components. But yeah everything works and I'd say this was successful!

Looks like a cold solder joint from what I can tell (to an extent) have you tugged on it a little to make sure it dosnt come off? You will want to get your soldering iron hotter or leave it on the wire a bit longer.
