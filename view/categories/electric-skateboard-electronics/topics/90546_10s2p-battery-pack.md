If I have a 10s2p battery pack made up of Samsung 25r's (continuous discharge rate of 20a) because I have two 10s packs in parallel does that mean my motor could safely put a load of 40a of continuous discharge on the pack?

Its more like you have one 10s pack with 2 cells per parallel group

Correct, your 2p pack will output 40a continuous

Please dont make new topics for simple questions. This belongs in the noob questions thread.

@thisguyhere is correct though.
