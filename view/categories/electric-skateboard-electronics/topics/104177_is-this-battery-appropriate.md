I have a 6400 mah 5c 10s battery at home and i want to use it on my esk8board. how much range would i get approximately on urethanes, turnigy sk3 6374 192 kv and weight of about 70 kg. Also, is the max continious current of 30amps enough?
Thank you in advance.

It is enough for a single motor but it wonâ€™t get you massive range or speed. Probably around 5 miles and 20mph

Please go over to the  forum

They will answer you questions much better there
