I have a 13s 80a bms (which also works for 12s) and is really small and compact so it fits in almost all enclosures without taking space. It is still sealed I didnâ€™t open it. I also have a 2a and a 4a charger if u are interested

Then you dont even need to have a bms in your hands untill you do plenty of reading on batteries and bmss, this is like not understanding fractions and wanting to sign up for nasa

Theres plenty of discussions and threads explaining
