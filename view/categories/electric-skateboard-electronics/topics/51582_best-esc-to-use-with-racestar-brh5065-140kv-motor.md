I was looking for this one here: https://www.ebay.com/p/Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-Controller-With-Remote-Dual-Motors-ESC-Substitute/8011626566?iid=292388962662&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D44039%26meid%3D836e95932ea445acb06de55c5ed49cc0%26pid%3D100011%26rk%3D5%26rkt%3D12%26sd%3D302439713410%26itm%3D292388962662&_trksid=p2047675.c100011.m1850

But isn't seems so nice for the new building... However the price is quite good...


Waiting for answers...

VESC is the way to go if you want the best, and is 100 % worth the money.

That one is from maytech, and its not the best.. They usually fail pretty fast. Some have luck with them, but I would not recommend it. 
Focbox, Escape/B-box, VESC 6 (Expensive) ESK8 V1 and V2 will all work with that motor. These are the most reliable too
