When did they change the max charge rate?
My HCX-D223V1‘s are rated 20a charge
Could that be a misprint?

Accidentally let battery 10 lead touch something and short while soldering it on. Didn’t realize it hurt something till I couldn’t charge past 38 volts or so. Then I found it completely drained the p group that lead 10 was attached to. You can see the burnt spot on here
