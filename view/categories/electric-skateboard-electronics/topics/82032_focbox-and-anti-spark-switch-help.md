Hi guys

yesterday I went and plugged my new anti spark switch into the system. It did not work for some reason. I followed the instructions to connect the switch and I am 99% sure my polarities were right too. Anyway no smoke or sparks. also no voltage was coming off the anti spark switch. The light that was with it did not light up. 

today I removed the switch and installed loop key. I connect to my focbox but no lights shown. there is voltage coming off the xt 90 that leads to my focbox. Also here no sparks or burned stuff (I sniffed my focbox to check) 

I must have done something wrong when I installed my anti spark switch ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜¢. How can I diagnose what went wrong?

May be a warranty, this could be a faulty unit. 
Try connecting the FOCBOX directely to the battery

All Focboxes are tested before shipping. It includes a motor spin up test.

Have you tried turning it off and onðŸ¤£? JK

But are you using two focboxes or just one? Also if you did use two did you use it in can?

He tried it with a xt90 s and it had voltage and the focbox still didn't turn on.

Did you even bother to read?
