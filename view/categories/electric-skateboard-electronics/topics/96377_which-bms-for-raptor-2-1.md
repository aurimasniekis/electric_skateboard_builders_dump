Hello,
After a Groupride my Raptor 2.1 did not load anymore. After the help of a mate who had a clue we exchanged a burnt cable. Unfortunately it was still not loading. I took a closer look and discovered a defective transistor.

My question: Which BMS would work with the LCD and power button of the Raptor 2.1? I would not like to lose these functions.

Maybe try just replacing the broken part, it should be dirt cheap

Nothing to loose trying :wink:

Powerbutton and afaik LCD are plugged into the unity. Enertion has to provide a new BMS under warranty.

I have 3 options:

1. Waiting for my Warranty BMS from enertion (bad idea, want to ride this summer)

2. trying to repair the faulty bms like in the video 

3. purchasing diebiems?

...or get yourself a 15dollar bms until enertion ships a new one. This wont be your last board anyway :wink:

I have one of these tiny charge-only bms in my hummie deck. This is the 10s version

Doesn't have to. The unity itself drives powerbutton and lcd. I use this bms with a unity (no lcd tho) but you can check, the lcd wires should be plugged into the unity?

Edit, yes the small top left plug should be the display

2 cables (+/-) go directly from the LCD to the Unity.
but I don't see a direct connection from the powerbutton to unity.

The above picture shows the powerbutton plug - the one with 4 wires. The other one on the left is the receiver plug.

Can you suggest one for the Raptor 2.1? I rather go good than cheap. Plus what about amp rating? It's a stock Raptor 2.1

A BMS is only as good as you taking the time to check on it regularly to make sure everything is working as it should be.

I won't recommend any BMS as I don't trust any of them enough to put my name to a recommendation.

An easy way to keep an eye on cell levels is to use a smart BMS, but I doubt you will find one that will fit in such a small space.

Bms amp rating doesnt really matter as you can just bypass the BMS for discharge. As long as it can support your charge current, which nearly any BMS would, it will be fine.

Just make sure to find one that has balancing function. Not all of them do.

Also, you'll get a far better response over on the real forum - forum.

Make an account and ask your question over there, this place is dead.

It doesnt say anywhere in the description whether or not it has balancing function. Other than that it looks fine. Check with the supplier whether or not it has balancing function

Well.... I found the original BMS for the Raptor 2.1 mine was PCB Code 004 this one is a 006!!
Below you see the to different board types. 
I connected the new BMS. And the board start charging to 12% 29 Volts. Then the charger turned from red to green?! I measured the voltage at battery with my meter 29 Volts. 
It's the OEM space cell. Board is completely stock.

Damn! I bought an separated BMS (10S 60A) From Aliexpress. FOr now I unpluged everything inside my board. It's my ultimate test, if the battery still won't charge, I gonna have a good base for a DIY. Yeah it suck... I'm just conforting thinking than now I know more about eSk8 DIY ;)

So I don't know what to do the battery is charging in the beginning up to 12% and then stops charging indicated by the charger Light turning green. some people in this forum mentioned about balancing the battery pack I have no idea how to do that I noticed also that only half of the battery turns warm the other doesn't. Maybe @longhairedboy can help me with that. He lives relatively close by and we have the same hairdo....![IMG_20200105_225652|375x500](upload://dj4qZOmLdMA7I0AG8ou2chqyEJq.jpeg)

An auto balancing BMS will do the job. I waiting for my new BMS to see if it balance the battery and keep charging until 100%. If not, from my search, it will meen the battery is faulty so... Yup, gonna have to change the battery too. If anybody else have opinion, please go for it!
