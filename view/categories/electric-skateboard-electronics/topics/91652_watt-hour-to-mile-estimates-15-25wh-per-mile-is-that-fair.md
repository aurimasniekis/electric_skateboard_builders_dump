Hi Everyone,  I am trying to come up with a general estimate how what range you can modestly expect when you have a certain watt hour battery.  I understand that it will greatly depend on the configuration of the board and ESC, but I was wondering if i used 15 to 25 WH per mile, if that was a fair estimate?

An example:
10s4p Samsung 30q = 432WH = ~17.28 to 28.8 miles?

17.28(25WH per mile), and 28.8(15WH per mile)
```

Can you give us your weight (board + you + gear), wheels, power system, and terrain?

As reference, I'm getting 13Wh/mi using PU hubs on flat ground and moderate acceleration, 150lbs total

Low as 8 while cruising and high as 16 around hills max power

I was just thinking about a general number.  Not particularly for me or my board.  Like if my friends ask how much range a 10s4p would give them, I would say something like 17-28 miles depending on many factors

I'd say 10Wh/mi for small boards to 40Wh/mi for AT behemoths...25 is good average though

Yes.  Very fair.

Also, if you ride your board like it's a musclecar, you'll be at the top end.  If you ride your board like it's an analog, and treat the motors as ski-lifts (nod to @dareno) then you will get the highest range possible.  Most folks I think are somewhere in between those two.  I average about 19Wh/mi (12Wh/km)

Thanks man!  Very helpful.  I also get in between that range.  I did some simple reality checking to make sure it fit me too.

i average 40 Wh/mile on the raptor 2 i believe, but that was when i was full throttle the whole time

You think I should revise the number to 40wh/mile?

My electric scooter uses a 36V 13Ah battery (468Wh) and can get upwards of 30 miles of range.

Then again I only weight like 100lbs, and the scooter's tires are pumped up to 45 PSI.

I think my friend got upwards of 25miles on a 12s4p Samsung 30Q battery, dual drive 6355.
He weights ~220lbs.

I have the Raptor 2.1.

Medium Cruising, Flatroad, 88kg: **33Wh/Mile**

My raptor hubs consume 29-37 wh per mile. I even have the data logs to back that up.

My MBS mountain board uses a little less than 30 Wh/mi or 19Wh/km under close to worst case flat street riding conditions, e.g., lots of hard acceleration (flooring it up to 30+mph), hard braking, stop signs/lights. So, I'd say that any street board on urethane should be well below this consumption unless you're tackling lots of hills, weigh significantly more than my 200lb riding weight or are trying to break a land speed record.

my mono drive, dog runner draws 7Wh/mi

dual drive street carver draws 18Wh/mi - aggressive riding, with hills

dual drive pnumatic draws 25Wh/mi - aggressive riding, with hills

There's no such thing as an average DIY board.  Your wh/mile is dependent on rider weight, road conditions, configurations of the board, what wheels are on the board, how much throttle is applied, cruising speed, etc etc.

20Wh plus minus 5Wh for urethane wheels

40Wh plus minus 5Wh for pnumatic wheels

charge battery, turn on a gps app, go out and ride until your batteries dies..... use that number.

almost 17km with Raptor 2.1 and 97mm wheels.

It's like 40Wh/mile or 24Wh/km/h..pretty bad

The WH of the battery is the last factor to how much range you would get out of it. Before you know how much range, you have to take into account so many other factors. That’s why all these guys give different answers, they all have different riding styles, environments, and specs and setups. Honestly the best answer to how much range will I get, is to go for 10 rides in different places, ride fast, slow, uphill, downhill. Then have someone that weighs 50-100lbs more or less than you and have them do the same 10 rides. Then average your wh usage over these rides and that will give you an average. Still though you WH usage can drastically change with every ride. Or not if you only take your board on a single route, like around a flat track. Hope this helps.

That’s ideal, but when you are the planning stages you can’t go for 10 runs.  I was trying to explain to someone what battery size and WH roughly equates into for range.  The end numbers I used are 15 to 25 WH per mile, which after reading the responses I think is pretty fair

It is fair but the range you get between 15wh and 25wh is drastic. It’s fair but very inaccurate. Thus the reason that so many Chinese Board companies inflate specs. Because being fair a 12 year old at 100lbs will absolutely go farther than a grown man at 165lbs. In this way your 15-25 is not fair, simply because each individual is going to use a completely different amount of energy. 15-25 is accurate I suppose for a standard board but when you’re talking Mountain Board vs. skateboard, I get on average riding in San Diego, around 37wh/m on a dual set up. If I gear down my wh usage also goes down. If I change my vesc specs, my wh usage goes up. If I change from 8” wheels to 4”wheels I get 18wh/m on a dual set up. After all this you have to take into account that there is so much that goes into wh usage. It’s not just a simple equation or spectrum. It’s a very individual number based on many factors. You would literally have to split the boards into sections, and subsections on top of subsections to get an average or a spectrum.

https://calc./#/0

That link is an Esk8 calculator. For this to be as accurate as possible you need to know your setup efficiency as well as wh/km but with this tool you can at least estimate range before you know the exact numbers. Good luck with your plan and your build!
