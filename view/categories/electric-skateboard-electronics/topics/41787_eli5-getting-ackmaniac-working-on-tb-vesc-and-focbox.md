I am a 5 year old when it comes to programming. I learn quick. If someone could maybe do a brief run down or video of switching over to Ackmanik I would surly use it.

If you could provide a link it would be super helpful. That thread is so large it is intimidating to go searching through it.

I was hoping to have a new thread with a quick rundown of how to get Ackmaniac working for us morons. But I guess that is a lot to ask.

For example @longhairedboy fried a VESC trying to detect his motor. I still can't find a simple explanation on how to install and run Ackmaniacs BLDC tool.

[quote="Ackmaniac, post:1, topic:12286"]
Here are some additional install instructions. Read them before please:

Be aware that this is only for Hardware Version 4.10 or above (VESC-X as well).

Important: You have to flash the Firmware with this modified BLDC-Tool.

Open the downloaded BLDC-Tool
Upload (Flash) the new Firmware File "VESC_Ackmaniac_Mod_2_54.bin" which is available in the Dropbox link.
Adjust the settings of your VESC. I would not recommend to use a saved config. It would be better and safer to set the values manually. So you should make screenshots of your old setup or write it down.
It is always possible to flash back to Vedders original Firmware.

This Firmware has the Version 2.54. So don't be surprised by that. When you start the Modified BLDC-Tool the first time it tells you that the Firmware is not the same. So you have to flash it with my modified firmware. So no mistakes can happen anymore with the Firmware flash.

```
1. Use your current BLDC tool to flash the firmware (connect to vesc, click firmware tab, select .bin file, click upload)
2. Using the new bldc tool, connect to the vesc again. Do a read config on main screen. Set the amp limits and current limits appropriately.
3. Now if you run FOC, life is super simple. You just click the buttons in the correct order, waiting for the motor to finish moving around (keep the motor off the ground for this).
4. If BLDC, click start detection. If it doesn't start spinning, just might need to adjust the current.
5. Click write config. This takes care of your MC Config. Now you need to set your App Config.
6. Click app config and click read config. Select ppm (or ppm+uart if using bluetooth).
7. Set main speed controller to id 0. Then under ppm, use the ppm wizard to balance it correctly if the default settings aren't working well for you (default settings are perfect for the mini trigger).
8. If your using abluetooth module, make sure you set the baud rate correctly under the UART tab (9600 for many)
9. If your doing multiple vescs, on the first vesc (vesc id=0), click "multiple esc's over can" under ppm. And for the other vescs, under app config, the increase the id by one for each vesc, and select "send status over can".
10. Now ride cause your done!
