Heya everyone,

Transformed my Benchwheel to make use of some 6S2P and 6S1P Lipo batteries after the stock batteries died after a couple of rides. Much more consistent output now, really enjoyable.

Now the last missing link is a nice battery compartment.... seen a couple of sources in the States but my question would: do we have any 'local' sources here in Europe?

Cheers!
