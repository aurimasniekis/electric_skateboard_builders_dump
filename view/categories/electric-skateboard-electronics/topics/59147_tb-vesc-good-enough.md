I'm looking into the final parts list for my electric skateboard that I am building, however, one of the parts that I am not sure of is the VESC. I want a VESC for the extra bit of tweaking, but I'm not sure I was to spend nearly 300 Canadian pesos on a focbox when my build is going to be somewhere around the 500 Canadian dollar mark. I know the VESC isn't something that I can really cheap out on, but one of the ones in between price ranges between basic ESCs and the focbox is the TorqueBoards VESC. I will be running it on a 10s2p li-ion battery I will be putting together (the battery isn't final, depending on pricing I may have to go with 2 3s li-pos).

I guess I just want your guys opinion on the TorqueBoards VESC for my case as I've seen mixed things about it here

300 Canadian pesos

with the batterys you described I doubt you could supply enough power to make the vesc kill iteself unless its setup really correctly... it should suit your needs :)

I've got multiple boards running TB VESC's in both BLDC and FOC mode. It's a myth that they aren't good. 

The FocBox will allow you higher amps, voltage and erpm but as long as your values are conservative you'll be fine.

I know I’ll cop some shit for this but the HobbyKing vesc is now a really good contender, they’ve changed to the Vesc 4.12 and if it does happen to fail you can send it back because it has a 1 year warranty. There also about the same price if not cheaper than Tb vescs which don’t have a warranty
