I wanna use the bldc tool but I can't use it because of the firmware. so I did my research on here but I looked at the vesc tool bootloader and I don't understand it I just keep trying to update it to the 2.18 firmware but it wont work.

You need the bldc tool, not the vesc tool I guess.
Itâ€™s the old version of the service program

You get this message when you open bldc tool right? Canâ€™t you just ignore that message by pushing ok and after flash old firmware?

Hm thatâ€™s strange.
I never downgraded a vesc.
It should be possible like upgrading too.
I think with a stl link you could fix it easily but probably you donâ€™t have that right?
You before already changed the firmware on your vesc or itâ€™s first time?
Could be that there is no bootloader installed, which could be a reason why itâ€™s not functioning.
Donâ€™t  ask me how to check if there is a bootloader or not ðŸ˜…
But iâ€˜m sure a short search in our forum will give you an easy answer too it.

Didnâ€™t read everything. But looks like for this you also need a stl link. Thought I read somewhere that itâ€™s possible also without ðŸ¤”

There is a bootloader tap in the vesc tool.
Try to check if you have that, if no load.
Than switch to bldc tool and try again to load the old firmware

Yeah, might need more info. 

Does it connect to the PC? What is the sequence the led does when it power up?
