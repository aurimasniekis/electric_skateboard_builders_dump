Hi there,

I'm building a universal CCCV charger using a DPS5015.
I have a lot of board and almost each one requires its own charger. What a waste of space and money, and what a pain to carry !

I received my unit without the Schottky diode for protecting against current flowback.
The manual says it's not required, but I'm not sure...

Do you have experience with it ?
What are the specs I need to focus in for selecting one by my own ? (Max 15A @ 50.4V)

Many thanks electronics gurus !
