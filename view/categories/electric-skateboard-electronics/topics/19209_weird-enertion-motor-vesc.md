the motor as shown is acting really weird, as if it is stuck or something....
i thought it was the motor's problem, but my friend told me to tryy swapping the vesc between them, so i did
i realized that which ever motor having problem is always caused by the same vesc x... so from my observation i think its a vesc x problem... 
i tried to use BLDC to  change the setting between original vesc default, and same setting with the other vesc x that is working smoothly, and that stuck thing is still there... 
 
I NEED HELP
