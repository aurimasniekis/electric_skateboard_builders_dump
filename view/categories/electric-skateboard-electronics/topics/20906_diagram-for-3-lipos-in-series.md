Does anyone have a diagram or a picture of 3 lipos in series? I'm slightly confused as how to wire them up.

1st battery has it's + to plug, - to batt 2 +, 2nd batt - to batt 3 +, and 3rd batt - to plug.

You can measure voltage increase from the first battery at 4.2v (full charge lipo), and 8.4v from 1st battery + and 2nd batt -, or all 3 for 12.6v at the XT90 plug!

(not to scale...)

I had a feeling it was to look like that but I wasn't positive and didn't want to start shorting things, thanks!
