I'm having issues while charging Enertion Vesc (new batch) with the scp4. 

It's the second Vesc that wont spin the motor and says "overvoltage", After charging completed.
Settings are as default, no particular changes.

Maybe the Vescs can't be charged while connected to the spc4? Or I have to set 36v max voltage in the BLDC tool?

make sure max input voltage is 57 on both VESCs
