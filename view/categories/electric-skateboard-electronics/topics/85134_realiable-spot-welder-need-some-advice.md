After going through 2 "Boss level spot welders", 5 lipos over a year and a half, and a Sunkko  737G+ Ive had it enough
Basically after less than 2 months of use another new boss level welder has failed on me or the lipos which i doubt because they are 2 5ah panther graphene in parallel
I even heated up the lipos to room temperature at 25 celsius over night before trying again

I got 6 packs to build, deadlines are approaching and the welds I get are really weak, so weak that I can almost break them by hand.
And lately the welders failing on me, and throwing lots money in thrash for customs has been really stressing me out

I usually would get welds stronger than the strip itself, the welds would stay "sticked" to the cell and the strip would just start ripping from them

Im desperate to find a welder that is reliable,does not overheat, yet strong enough to weld 0.15mm pure nickel or more
All I found on the internet were sunkkos, which I find very sketchy, and sunstone welders with no pricing on their sites, and arduino based and lipo powered

I found the @aulakiria welder amazing, for a few batteries, but using it for regularly building packs its not so great, because even with a heatsink and a fan I menage to get it to 40celisus


What welders do you use guys use?

Kweld is very robust. He sells a wall plug psu with a super capacitor bank so you don't have to deal with lipos for welding all day with consistent power. But if you go at it like a madman it'll still get hot. When I weld fast the elecrtodes get too hot to hold. Then the battery connections, then the wires. Will want several probe sets to swap if welding a crap-ton very fast.

I had the EXACT same experience as you and went with the next level spot welder, it's freaking amazing go for it, it's build like a tank.

However I suggest you add a capacitor bank or use 2 lipos in parallel or they will build up heat really fast

I have been considering this welder for a backup, just last week

Have you considered getting 2-3 welders with batteries and switching them out every 50 or so welds?
That way they would stay cool and last longer plus you always have a spare if one breaks.

The heat is probably the reason they keep dying on me, on a certain speed of welding the temperature on the sensor stays at 30celsius, but that is wrong for sure, the mosfets are at probably like 100c
3 boss level Welders would cost me around 700$, that is not really a solution to my problem but is my last choice

I use the sunkko 709a. But I see there is difference between each 709a welder. There are some good welders from a batch and some bad. 

It is also important which circuit breaker your house have. I use a 30A type C circuit breaker.  My house installation has a possibility to deliver (at peak) 80A @240v. A spotwelder is such like a big short-circuit for your home installation.

Not sure what to tell you, my boss welder has been rock solid, probably approaching 10k welds at this point. 

I do have three lipos in parallel, and welder is heatsinked with a fan. 

If it appraches 40c, i just take a break for a few minutes, temps come down to 25c pretty quick. 

I find the biggest factor in quality welds is how fast the battery is. Hence the three lipos in parallel. And keeping the thing cool.

I notieced that the welds are much better with cool mosfets they probably switch better cold
Mine was heatsinked with a pc fan as well
7ms 2x 2ms 0.15 pure nickel for first layer
9ms second
I used 2 5ah 75c graphene so currents shouldnt be a problem unless the batteries have got weaker over time
Since the welder probably did like 12-13k welds

That's how to tell that the weld is done **correctly**
If the strip breaks too easily why blame the welder?
Just get thicker material...

You can make a welder out of microwave transformer, budget under $200 and gets you welding current of 1500A.
Also powered from mains so no fokin with batteries as a source.

But will need quite a bit of work, needs some basic handyman skills and tools.

I made a simple welder using a timing circuit from AliExpress and a 1400w microwave transformer. The strips tear before the welds come off. The wires do seem to get a little warm/hot tips after about 30-40 welds but using larger tips and thicker wire will solve this issue, I opted for cheaper 21mm^2 wire instead of 35mm. Total cost was about $40 and I’ve made one pack so far

At the moment, I can not take a risk to receive a bad welder like the last time
I managed to get unlimited power through my main cable box and the only limit is the wires and fuses basically, I installed a 40A C breaker fuse for the welder, but sadly it didn't make the welds.
@taz Its on my list to try some time soon, but hopefully I will be happy with the Kweld

Also I just got an idea to power these welders with a portable car starter like this

Have you considered using a cheap TIG welder?

They usually have controls between DC and AC. Most have current and voltage control. A quick search turned up a 20-200V DC and up to 200A at the electrodes. 37A at the wall socket.

You'd just have to hook up an Arduino to control the foot pedal. You probably could spring the foot pedal and hook it up between the pedal and the welder to control the timings.

Only problem I see is the welder may not have good ramp up and ramp down time. I'm sure you could find that spec somewhere though.

Any idea how kweld is controlling the amount of energy?
Is he just measuring voltage and voltage drop on MOSFETs?
```

## \#29 Posted by: deucesdown Posted at: 2019-02-24T23:24:35.895Z Reads: 128

```
Yeah he's actually measuring the current. There's actually a calibration routine built in. Once you assemble, you go into calibration and short the leads together. kweld measures the total resistance of the circuit. Then it can measure current, convert to joules, and use that to control the amount of energy going into the weld spot. With the idea that using joules, you can keep the welds consistent throughout your lipo's state of charge.

After each weld, you can keep the pedal down, and it'll tell you measured resistance, time, and current.

IIRC the goal is to tune the resistance of the whole circuit including the lipo, so it can deliver between 1000-1500amps.

The thing is like a horse. I don't think you can kill it. Everything gets hot before the mosfets. If you watch his youtube videos, there's a mode where if you make contact with both probes, the welder will discharge within a set time. In the videos, he's talking, and accidentally shorts the leads together while in this mode, and ZAP! More than once, no issues. I scared the shit out of myself doing the same with my unit, also no issues. He added audibles after that video lol, so you know when it's getting ready to fire.

Thanks.

I'm asking because although the design is excellent, I would rather have like 5kA as I already have a 1kA welder and I'm limited in terms of thickness of material I can use.
This would mean I have to go 5x all the power components.
But I actually have found the schematics so perhaps after I finish building my esk8 I will start working on it and make a 5k version compatible with his firmware.

Oh and also I want to supply it from ultra capacitors, charged by some CC/CV LED driver PSU so I don't bother with lipos.

He talked about his design a lot, with some specifics at eevblog. But it's not open source, so you might have trouble cloning his design.

What are you gonna do with 5kA?

At his website there were urls to EEVBLOG and endless sphere, first one not working second has schematics so how not open soruce?
Or you mean the code is not open source?
Well that shouldn't be much of a problem, he would have to be pure evil to not send me modified version of the firmware with just bumped up max current/joules settings.
And even if not then decompilation and then change of the matching numbers, right? :stuck_out_tongue: 

Well as I said I would like to use decent thickness materials to weld the cells together not some paper-like nickel plated steel shyte :smiley:

Everything works, but the mosfets dont work as good, even when i turn on the ms lenght, probably the got cooked from the heat, and the welder before this one the mosfets on it completely died, and it displayed fet error on the screen which is fixable for like 20$

If you want your boss level welder to last, weld every 3+ seconds and dont stay above 30-35celsius for long time, with cooling especially, since the temperature sensor is not located on the mosfets but instead on the copper wire of the power out wire, and its temperature is not really important.

I could not use 2 grahpene 5ah 75c lipos because they would give out 2000+A and the welder would refuse to weld to protect itself

Also the connections inside the lipos broke from welding and heat so I would not reccomend to use lipos with kWeld
I broke 2 batteries in the same day...

I will probably just get a really big lead acid battery today and try to use it

I started doing my own spot welder yersterday after finding an old microwave in garbage. Cost with everything will be a cheap 40$ ![20200201_225119|375x500](upload://e1sSW6cJukU65Z29fqYyc2SfRtu.jpeg) ![20200201_225147|666x500](upload://pSo15p7Fp5uqLYMc2sQUul4JrgO.jpeg) ![Screenshot_20200201-225507|250x500](upload://2nZ95E647hM4LYurYUwyqX4Lvu5.jpeg) 

I will put a powerful cooling fan , the box is isolated with fiber glass resin and the  also acting as a heat sink 

Ther is no way i would spend 300$ on a spot welder when i can build one from scrap
