Hi guys

today I attempted the sparkle GT2B mod. Everything went fine until the USB relocation part. 
it now looks like this ![15486015355547587364578822120855|666x500](upload://mbAHe3v5GIa8odebvOBKBTRKls5.jpeg)

I don't think it still works if I try to solder it on there. 

what to do now and do you guys have any tips soldering these super small parts?

You not the first one with this issue ðŸ˜…
Try to clean it up and look if you can save it somehow.

Which tip you used for soldering the pins?
Use flux an tap the terminals and the wires before you solder them together in future.

But when I try to like move them I'm afraid the wires will touch each other. Could I glue or expoxy those wires so they won't move?

```
You found the biggest wires to solder it on ðŸ˜…
I have some liquid tape for situations like that.
Guess a drop of epoxy could do the job too.
It will fix the wires and isolation them from each other (but make sure in this position itâ€™s working before you put the epoxy on top)
