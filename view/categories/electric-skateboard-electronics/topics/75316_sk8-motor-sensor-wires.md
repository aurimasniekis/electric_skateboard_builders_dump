I am trying to confirm that the order that the motor sensor wires come in is the same as the VESC. Can anyone who has used them sensored confirm this?

Hey man. The sk8 and sk8 vesc are fully compatible sensor wise.  If this is what you're asking?  I've also used my sk8 with focboxes and again fine.  What vesc are you talking about?

as far as i know only the ESCapes (and derevates which use the same PCB)
have switched order of sensor wires.
From motor side it´s always coming in the same order like on Focbox/VESC4/VESC6 and Flipsky4/6.
please correct me if I´m wrong!

If this is true then that means I've got busted sensors on two SK8s, sucks ass
