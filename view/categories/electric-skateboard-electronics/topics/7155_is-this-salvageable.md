I think I was too aggressive trying to get my DRV8302 off and this happened?

Can anybody chime in and see if this is salvageable?

You lost the pad of pin 2 on the drv, no biggie, it's NC anyway and you flung C22 on the floor somewhere.

Clean up the pads with solder wick, replace C22, you should be good
