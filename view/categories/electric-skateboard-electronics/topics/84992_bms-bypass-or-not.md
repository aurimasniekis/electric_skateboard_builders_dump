Entirely up you on bypass. Comes down to if you think your esc can handle the extra Amps for a few seconds when needed or not. If so, bypass. If not, leave it. If you do leave it, you risk drawing Amps past the bms limit and it shutting off (most likely while at high speed) whether or not your esc could actually handle it.

Personally I run bypassed on a bestech d127

I think i will go bypassed to. Im using the unity so i think it can handle a 300a burst. But say i had a battery could easily discharge 400 amps would the unity be able to take that or will i meed a 300a fuse wired to the battery and the unity?

The fuse will blow the same as a bms would cut you off at overload. The fuse will protect your unity from taking damage but I put my faith in the unity and run unfused as well (excluding the mandatory fuse on charging port). Unless you're running an insane battery setup, this is my advice.

This bms worked well for me, also @Eboosted uses them in his packs so they are pretty reliable if you can wait for shipping

+1 for @hyperIon1. They made both of my packs and I couldn't be happier with them.
