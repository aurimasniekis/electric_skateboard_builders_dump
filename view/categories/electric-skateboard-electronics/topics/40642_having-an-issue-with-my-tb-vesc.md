warning to those on a low budget, do not buy the torque boards VESC. Although the price point seems attractive, they do not last.

this is wildly untrue. i guarantee you it blew because of user error. I will stand behind the TB vescs until I blow one from something other than user error.

@moderators, time to delete this thread, I could just do it if I was a mod ðŸ˜‰

They're good for what they're used for; lower voltage applications at lower current settings.

While it's true that they aren't the highest quality VESC out there, they are definetly worth the low price tag. I run 6S FOC Hybrid mode, and never have I burned out the VESC/DRV chip.

You just need to find what VESC suits you best, if you're going for a 12S high amperage FOC Hybrid setup, then naturally the TB VESC wouldn't be your best shot. Maybe a FOCBOX, or even VESC 6 is more suitable. Other than that, TB VESC is great for most ESK8 applications, espeically considering its low price point.

I understand your issue as a new builder many have been in a similar predicament, but change the post to addressing what could. Have gone wrong because we don't allow bashing on the forum. Many of his products have had issues and his customer service is not the best yet it is possible that you may have made a mistake or you might be correct and it was just a bad vesc either way just keep it civil

It's likely that you see more TB VESC issues because they sell a ton of VESC's. I've got 4 running right now, 2 of them for well over a year. The only one I ever had an issue with was because of foc and @torqueboards  replaced it. 

Just a numbers game. You sell 10,000 and you see a larger number of issues not a larger percentage.

@coleg411

User error Nr. 1: You were running 245kv on 12s Lifepo4 it's 43.2V it's more than a 10s equivalent which is 42V.

User error Nr. 2: You chose to use 245kv motor, with 43.2V you will have 65359erpm, the vesc might limit the motor speed but only during acceleration, if you were going downhill it could fry. 

I've been runing TB vesc on my 10S vanguard for more than a year with 190kv motors and still working perfect. 

You shouldn't beware people about Torqueboards but beware people to avoid these mistakes, that'll be fair

Batteries sag. Realistically, even in lab conditions, he will never see that voltage under power, let alone full throttle. Unless he's spinning no load conditions.

Negative ghost rider, look at his settings. He enabled the negative torque if erpm limit is reached. This would mean that his board brakes as he reaches that speed. It could induce a lot of heat issues but not what you described

Ollinvesc is still going strong though, using it as my daily commute

like said before, the higher you go on motor kV, the more likely you fry your DRV.
If you wanna go safe on foc, get an improved one with upgraded components and use a motor with less kV then recommended. For example 10s with 140 kV, maybe 170 kV should be more than bulletproof.
