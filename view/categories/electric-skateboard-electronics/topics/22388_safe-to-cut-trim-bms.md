Wondering if it is alright to trim the BMS along the red line so I can make it fit in the enclosure? Already rounded some edges, but really need that extra clearance lol

Don't. You risk cutting connections inside the bms itself that could ruin it. If anything, dremel the walls of your enclosure slightly (and carefully) for more clearance

I wouldn'tâ€‹ risk breaking a BMS. There are probably multi-layer traces and connections you cannot see at a glance. Just don't.

As long as you didn't trim where the thicker green lines (circuits) are you should be fine
