Hey folks! Sorry if this is a silly question. 
So I have a Tacon Bigfoot 160 (245kv) . The motor wires are very stiff. Just wondering what anyone else has done in this situation? Silicone bullet extension maybe? Trying to figure out the best way to mount without causing too much tension. 

Thanks all,
Dan D.
