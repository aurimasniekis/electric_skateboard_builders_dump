Iâ€™m looking for a charger to use for a my 10s4p battery made using the 30Q. I have seen a lot of the Brick type chargers andI would like a charger that was a little better then that. I have looked at the Luna cycle chargers for 36v and I did a search for the Luna  cycles chargers on here didnâ€™t see much. So besides the Brick chargers what do you guys use and does anyone is the Luna chargers for eboards?

This looks interesting
I know it's a brick charger, but I ordered one just to see what's inside, particularly if it has a voltage pot ðŸ˜‰

Does anyone know where to get less-than-2A chargers?  Like 42V 1.8A or 42V 1A

Wow, [that](https://m.ebay.com/itm/42V-4A-Lithium-Battery-Charger-for-36V-4A-Li-ion-Ebike-Power-XLR/282761660670)'s a big mess.  

No way to know what that is without testing it myself `Output 36V 1.0A (1500mA), max 42V.`
1500mA â‰  1.0A
