Most of the APS 63mm motors have 10mm shaft so you will probably need to order motor pulley from APS

The HEV are good, I've been using the HEV 6355s and 6374s

Depends on what you want. Large hills? More torque, less speed

Less hills? Want more speed? Less torque, more speed

Be aware that 6374's weigh about 1 pound heavier than a 6355. That means for a dual setup, you're gaining 2 pounds or about 1kg by going with dual 6374's over dual 6355's. 

For most people dual 6355's are enough. Unless you're trying to bomb up 25+ degree hills, or if you weigh over 250 pounds, you probably don't *need* 6374s.

Also, the choice of trucks and whether you can fit dual 6374's should be taken into consideration.

and also this 

http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/cnc-kit/3mm-key-steel/

you'll want to choose 10mm bore and 15mm belt width. Then you can decide on what tooth count you want. higher tooth = less torque but faster top speed, less tooth = higher torque less top speed. use the esk8 calculator to figure out the numbers.

APS pulleys are very expensive, drill press and 10mm bit is cheaper so is beltingonline

I think someone should try a pair of these. 
For science..

They also have 63 variety which might be more better for these who are.power hungry :) though evolve uses similar.size.motors.. so might not be as big problem.if they do output 1500w or so

I'm running dual 5063 but on Evolve truck hangers. They'd be too long for calibers but plenty powerful.

I'm running APS HEV 6355 190kv and 6374 200kv
Both on 10s. 
The 6355s are great for flat to 10%grade and can barely handle 20% grade with 15:40 gears and 90mm wheels. Rider weight 195 lbs
The 6374s are heavier and have less free roll (more magnet drag)
They have more low end torque and climb hills with less throttle than 6355s
I would only recommend 6374s if your regularly climbing hills of 20% and steeper
Or if you weigh over 200 lbs

I doubt you'd be able to fit two of them on any hanger on the market to date, the 84mm length is far too long. 

If you were running a single motor, it might work. And its sensored, always a plus.
