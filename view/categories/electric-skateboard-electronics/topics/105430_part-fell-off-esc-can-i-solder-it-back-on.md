![image|375x500](upload://dNFEeufJ7MMFpYNVkr6TLxTPS0p.jpeg) My board stopped working all of a sudden and going back into my electronics I see that a part fell off my esc. Can I salvage this? If so, in what direction do I solder it back on. Also what does this part do?

Wouldnâ€™t hurt to try.... all else fails, you can sends it in for repairs

That's a ceramic capacitor, you can just try to solder it back on. Its a non-polar capacitor so it doesnt matter which way it goes.

Good luck.
