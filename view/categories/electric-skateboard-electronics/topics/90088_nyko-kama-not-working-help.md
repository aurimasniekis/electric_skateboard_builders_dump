I am using a wireless Nyko Kama to control my board, but it is not working. I followed a build guide ( https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-faq-connect-the-nyko-kama-wireless-wii-nunchuck/139 ) posted here exactly. The joystick pairs with the remote, but whenever I try to use the remote to send an input, it resets the connection (which is not good obviously). I have triple checked my wiring, and it is good. There are no shorts, and all connections are strong. I am using a Flipsky 4.12. If anyone could help me, that would be great. Thanks!

Did you connect to the Flipsky using Flipsky's vesc's pin-outs from their website and not the pin-outs in the link you provided?
