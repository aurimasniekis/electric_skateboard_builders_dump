So based on my offset pattern what's the recommended option for making the series connect? I have the offset nickel strip that I'll be laying down.... I could either use some 10-12ga wire to bridge the connection and solder it to the nickel... Or do I just spot weld a good few layers across the 2 neighboring cells and fold it in half at the end??

Sorry I should have been.more specific.... I meant from one pack to the other.... Not the cells already glued together....!

Nickel tinned copper stranded wire soldered on. 

(Like silicon super worm/power wire)

Something like this? Obviously trimmed to a nice length... And then when I lay them side by side... The wire Will lay flat on the top of the pack....

Will 12ga suffice....or use 10?
