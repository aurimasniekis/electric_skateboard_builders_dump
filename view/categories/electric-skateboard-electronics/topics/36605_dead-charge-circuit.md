Well I looked over at passenger seat in my truck to see that I'd left my remote on for almost 2 days (45 hours).  Stuck a meter on it, and the battery still showed 3.81v.  What's that? 60% battery life left?  Guess I never have to worry about a dead battery as long as I remember to charge up every couple months!  And don't leave it on for a week straight...
