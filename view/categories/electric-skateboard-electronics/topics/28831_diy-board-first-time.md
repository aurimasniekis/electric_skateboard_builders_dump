Yeah some specifics would help. Cause to some people "fast" is 25 mph and for some, "fast" is 40 mph. Same with range. Those 2 specs really help determine what parts to recommend

A Fast board with long range and quality parts could easily cost you $1500+ And that's if you just buy the parts and do all the assembly yourself..

probably the cheapest way to have long range and high speed is with a 12s setup using two 6s lipos connected in series mounted in a quick access enclosure.
You buy a total of six 6s lipos to make 3 interchangeable packs. You take them out of the board to charge them with a hobby balance charger. 
You can ride with one 12s pack in the board and the other two in your back pack charged and ready to swap for extended rides.
I did this on my first build with dual hub motors. 33 mph top speed and range limited only by how many packs you can carry on your back.

How much do you weigh?

Maybe this could be a community build?  I have trucks and great mounts and a loose enclosure for you somewhere...Who's in? Let's build Stormboard "a good long lasting fast board for 1000 or under. I even have an 8s5p battery I'll donate to the build for $300.

I didn't know they were. Can't see any apparent reason for the 50s to be more expensive than the 44s. Afaik it's the same truck only with a slightly different hanger angle. I bought mine for about 25 usd a piece.

They are more popular so more demand most likely.  Same price usually, but i see the 44's discounted every once in a while because old stock i'd guess.

I'd stick to 50's even if a few $ more.  better turn and less chance of wheelbite if setup properly.

Your requirements for light, plus range, plus speed are humorous, but i think folks have you on the right track now.  I didn't see you respond to [quote="psychotiller, post:24, topic:28831"]

How much do you weigh?
[/quote]

board shape will determine both wheels and room for electronics/enclosures.  Weight is the biggest one to know since what moves a 140 rider vs 265lb rider (like me) will be very different.

And hills?  I've been to parts of ireland it wasn't crazy steep hills, but not very flat.  Where you ride - hills or flat?  If hills - how steep 15%?  20%?  25%+?

And before you say - cheap , light, fast, and able to go up 45% hills...  go measure your steepest in your neighborhood and let us know actual vs expected.

GL!

If you've never ridden a longboard before you _might_ want to aim for less top speed and more range. I've been cruising for years now and anything more than 20 mph is really fast on imperfect roads.

50 Cals is a good idea. You could go with the Kegels (80mm) or the Abec 11 flywheel variety (83,90,97, and now 107 mm). Larger wheel will you a higher top speed.

Hey @stormboard.

You keep partially answering.  I get it's all new, but a bit more info will help us help you.

1 - Weight : 13 stone / 180'ish lbs - got it.  Not too heavy for a single motor which is good (I'm 19 stone / 265'ish and ride singles often).  You will want a 15mm belt setup.

2 - Deck preference.  Pick one you like man.  This is the best part of DIY esk8 - ability to take your favorite deck and make ti go VROOM!  Go to daddies board shop and look around - i'd suggest the symetrical (easiest to fit bigger wheels like 83mm and larger).

3 - i'd go Flywheels if you can afford them.  Clones if not.  Most flexibility and most gears available.  Kegels are nice too but more $ and only a few gear options, then locked into those wheels only.  Vs ability to run 76mm-107mm (97's realistically) all with the same gear.

4 - Hills?

GL!

## \#50 Posted by: jammin Posted at: 2017-08-03T00:00:23.114Z Reads: 90

we can't spoon feed you the answers... Figure out your battery solution and go from there. I'd look up all of the past esk8 builds on the forum and start getting some ideas. [Shameless plug for my build (~$700)](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-time-build-10s-190kv-vesc-superglider/27366?u=jammin)

You can save money on the deck and enclosure. You _shouldn't_ skimp on the batteries, motor,  or ESC. Not sure if it's easier/harder finding stuff in the UK (including the shipping / tax costs). Honestly anything with a decent wheelbase from Earthwing, JET, Bustin, Madrid, etc. is a good place to start (all of 'em are great boardmakers!)

If you only plan on going 25 kmh (15 mph) then you could go 6s... less expensive battery too, spend more on mAh. Turnigy makes good motors and lipos. For an ESC go with a VESC, you won't regret it. GT2B remote / receiver is popular here too. Motor mounts can be dependent on the setup, but it depends on how much DIY work you're willing to do

HTH and GL!

If you've never ridden a longboard before my advice is get a longboard and learn the basics. you dont belong on a board that goes faster than you can run especially if you have no experience.  Get in touch when you can foot brake and do shut downs.

## \#52 Posted by: jammin Posted at: 2017-08-03T02:49:17.541Z Reads: 83

A good option is to build a complete from somewhere like Muirskate / Daddies and build it with the deck you want for esk8 (and Caliber IIs, flywheels / kegels if you can get them) so you can overlap the costs a little bit when the time comes.

Looking for range more than speed so i need higher mah ,i mean 9s probly do but the 12s wud give longet range off one charge and in time have another set charged in my bag.

this will be my only mode of transport and how im going to get to places i used to use my car before i got put off the road so long range is a must. is it possible to make a board that has changeable batterys and also waterproof as irelands always raining:(

what baterys should i go with for long range wanna do a 4 3s lipo build. wanna buy the electrics first.
