And now I know why these motors fail, lol. Not great for the motor to run like that with no load for 2 hours before shipping to a customer, and that doesn't tell you anything about how hot they will get when under load. They need to run those at higher currents under load, the currents we will actually reach when riding. They must be pulling a very low current to run like that and no wonder they are so cool. The sad reality is, their stator is too small for most. They will become magnetically saturated and you get what I like to call the nuclear effect in regards to heat. Depends on your weight and how you ride, but most will have more issues than successes with them.

Yup. Pointless test. Need load.
