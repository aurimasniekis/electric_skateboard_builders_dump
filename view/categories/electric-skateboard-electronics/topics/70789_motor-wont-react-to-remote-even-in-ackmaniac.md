Might be off base here but is your board carbon fiber, or wrapped in carbon fiber? If so did you glue it down to the board with any metal exposed from the phase wires?

esp if using special throttle curve

@stormboard1
Connect your setup to PC and check if on Master FOCBOX (or Single FOCBOX)
In remote tab, current no reverse with brakes is selected.
Some time with vibrations, it get reset to disabled.

Whats up with the shredding of belts?  Probably a misalignment or improper belt tension

I know you were going to send this over?
Have you got as many photos of the setup so perhaps people can trouble shoot without spending on postage...

Pictures will be ideal.
Lots of people to cast an experienced eye over the setup.

In the bottom photo it looks like the mount isn’t parallel with the wheel pulley? Can you measure the distance either side? 
What belts are those? I recently bought some belts from China which were badly sized. They just wouldn’t run right.
