Hey guys, So I've been long boarding for a while now, and last year I wanted to get into eletric longboards mainly for the speed and avoiding those tiring up hills xD. In december i decided to invest in carvon exo, but that seemed to be a lost cause, so just recently, a couple days ago I charged back and got my money back from my bank. 

I was looking at evolve gt bamboo, and was very interested by it but however I was put down by its news of sudden braking at top speeds and other problems, for its specs, it just doesn't seem to be worth my 1500 dollars.

Now I want to try and build my own, but I have no budget for mistakes, and would like to get some advice from the experts and veterans, to see what you guys think.

I am looking to use either a landyachtz evo skate and explore, or evo falcon, or a switchblade 40/38.

http://landyachtz.com/boards/downhill-freeride-series/evo-skate-explore
http://landyachtz.com/boards/downhill-freeride-series/evo-36-falcon
http://landyachtz.com/boards/downhill-freeride-series/switchblade-40-mountain-blue-fade

Now I will need your help deciding which board, I like them all, but I am really not sure which is best, and best suited for what I want to do. I want fast casual cruising, downhill rides, and easy going uphill.

I am looking for around 30-40mph on flat surface.

Nextly the motors, which is best suited for my speed? (btw I weight 190 if that helps)

I saw these motors around the forum, any good for 30-40mph?
http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-6384s-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-200kv-4000w/

Also should I get a esc or vesc or focbox? I know the difference between esc and vesc but what about focbox? seems to be a new thing for me. I also have no clue how to set these up so anything over complicated I might mess up haha.

I think i can manage everything else except battery and pulley system.

what battery would be best to achieve good output for the motor above(or another motor you recommend) and get 30-40mph? I also think I will be using a LiPo for better output but open to suggestions.

And pulley system, I have no clue how this works, how many components I must buy, and what I should use with my motor and what teeths(motor and wheel) I need for 30-40mph. If you could explain a little and link me, I would be greatly appreciated.


So write now im just trying to learn about best options for motor, board, esc, battery, and pulley.

Thank you guys so much for taking the time to read my long ass post full of noob questions, but your time is much appreciated and really helps me out so much, thanks again, im open to all suggestions!

PS: My budget is around 1300-1600 USD.

Calc.esk8.it will be a great help for gearing ratio and voltage info. Are you hoping to run pneumatic or urathane? FOC box is an “optimized” version of the VESC 4.12. ESCAPES or VESC 6 is probably your best bet for these kinds of speeds due to a 60000 erpm limit on 4.12 configurations. Those motors should work and give you a nice gearing ratio to achieve your desired speeds.

Know that any of those boards will require you to have a dual diagonal setup assuming you are planning on going dual drive (highly recommended/required for these speeds)

awesome, thanks so much for your response! Ill def checkout the escapes or vesc 6 and could you explain what pneumatic and urathane differ and exactly what they are for? Sorry Im very clueless :stuck_out_tongue:

Pneumatic run much larger, starting at about 6” diameter wheels but provide a MUCH smoother ride. They are also more expensive. Urathane are your normal longboard wheels.

Im looking at 12S4P or a 10S5P, this is what I see going around, is that good enough for range and speed wise(output for the motors to get that speed)?

Also I kind of forgot what the numbers and s and p mean, would u be able to explain those to me?

You definitely need 12s for your target speeds. The s is the number of cells in series. The p is the number of cells in parallel

That motor will have no problem getting you past 30 with the right gearing with even just 10s battery. It will get you close or over 40 with 12s.  If its the first built to make things easier you could purchase a full kit.  Torqueboard sells one that takes care of alot of the guess work @torqueboards.   products/pro3-electric-skateboard-conversion-kit for example will get you what you want.

Following is build based on.. surprise! the evo deck, torque board trucks and batteries. FocBoxes, @psychotiller tires :)

It will but you'd probably want to get some risers in place for clearance.  Torqueboards batteries I believe are double stacked so they are thicker.  You could also reach out to other vendors to get custom batteries made that are longer but thinner.  If you want to go that route @psychotiller I believe make the batteries AND the enclosures to hold them :slight_smile:

For those speeds u will need 12s bud... I am currently running 10s5p and it goes forever but tops at 30 if I'm lucky but will cruise just fine at 27mph... I'm also 215 lbs, so that's also a factor

Here are two builds that are in line with what you’re looking for. 
As you’ll read and might well be aware. 30-40mph is quick and can very easily end in serious injury or worse. These guys pad up and wear helmets. Not everyone agrees it’s a good idea but at those speeds you’ll wish you did if you arrive at ground level without.
For batteries a 12s4p fits flat under those decks, I have a 10s5p under mine (fast enough for old me at 30mph) with big bms and dual focbox.   I run 97mm abecs and there is enough clearance with 1/2 risers. 
107s are lovely though and sixshooters even slicker.

Agreed... even at 27mph I wear a slide jacket, full face helm, compression slide shorts, and knee/shin guards... I have had my share of falls and believe me even at 27mph I have come out unscathed because of my gear... 

there was an accident I had at 10mph that sent me flying like superman and skidding on my stomach with nothing more than a helmet.... i couldn't sleep on my stomach for a little over 2 weeks due to road rash... so be safe and don't ride like a jack ass and always keep ur eyes peeled

I'm sure others have/will warn you but keep in mind 40mph downhill on a known surface with nothing but your skill to worry about is one thing. 40mph on the flats with hugely varying terrain and surfaces with several mechanical and electrical systems that could effectively chuck you off at any point they feel like it is another situation all together.

Honestly once you reach a certain amount of power weight doesn't affect top speed. I'm a heavy guy but my weight seems to affect low power board like the boosted. My buddy that weighs 100lbs less than me gets the same top speed on my board as I do he just gets there faster lol

This isn't bad advice. 

To op: 10S - 12S in 4P - 6P should serve you well.

I'd suggest dual focboxes. 6374 motors in 190 KV are great.  

I'm a fan of flywheels with 32-36t gears, with a motor pulley between 15 and 20t.

I'd suggest getting one of those HM-10 Bluetooth modules for changing settings on the road... Invaluable for tuning your ride.

I'm giving you such a large range of battery because price can be a huge factor for some, and weight for others. More batteries will obviously cost more, and weight more. A 4P configuration will be sufficient for most, but may leave some performance to be desired be it range or pushing higher than 80A batt max.  Also, when it comes to gearing, it doesn't hurt to factor into your cost the purchase of multiple different size wheel and motor pulleys so you can tune your ride for torque, balance between speed and torque, or just flat out speed.

To finish my reply, in the spirit of deckoz's comment... Going with a few different size pulleys will allow you to feel out your board at lower speeds, yet be able to swap to a higher speed setup when you do feel confident enough to. I'd heed deckoz's warning... I did the opposite, starting my 10S4P setup at 20/32. While it was great fun, it was a little bit too easy to get above 50mph and it tossed me off. I've since been working my way back up with my gearing, but I don't think I'll ever go that fast again, there's just no real reason to when 43-45 mph is almost plenty fast enough. I usually ride 15/32 or 20/36 nowadays. The main point I guess I'm trying to make is that you can go as fast as you want on any build just by changing gearing. 

Also, think about highly dewedging your rear truck, and look into chubby bushings for added stability as well. I'd probably still be riding 20/32 today had I had my trucks setup better from the get-go... One fall can cause scars that take a long time to heal, but sometimes it's the mental ones that cut the deepest.
