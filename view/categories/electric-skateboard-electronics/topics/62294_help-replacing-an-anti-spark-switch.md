Switch. 
We’ve identified the two wires on the right are for the led and the 3 on the left operate the switch. Teeny JST
Can anyone give me some pointers?

We’re having a re think. 
@L3chef Thanks for the offer but I think we’re possibly going down another route. The push button we had was 40mm long so it seemed a simple task to switch the switch...

Due to inexperience and user error I got the wrong rocker, shorted the antispark and am now wiser and minus some money :smiley:
