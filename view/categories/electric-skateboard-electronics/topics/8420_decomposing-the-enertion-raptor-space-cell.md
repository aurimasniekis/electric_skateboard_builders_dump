Hi guys,

I am wondering whether it will be possible to decompose a Enertion Raptor battery cell into two shorter packs (connected with flexible wires) which can cope with the flex of a Loaded Vanguard (flex 1). Does anybody know by chance how the three parallel groups are arranged? 

Any thoughts???

Cheers
Tobias
