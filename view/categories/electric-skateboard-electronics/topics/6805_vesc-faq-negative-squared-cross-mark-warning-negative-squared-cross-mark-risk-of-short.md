```
There have been a few cases of shorting the VESC due to the sensor connector pins piercing into the +ve power wire running from the capacitor board.

## :white_check_mark::white_check_mark::white_check_mark: QUICK FIX SOLUTIONS :white_check_mark::white_check_mark::white_check_mark:

1. Install additional shrink tube to protect the wires 
2. Reposition the wires so they are not being pressed into the pins when installed into your esk8
3. Cut the pins shorter
4. Put some glue over pins.

It's easier to just cut down those pins with a small and sharp side cutters. They won't perforate the cable anymore.

But be cautious that the cut off pins are not falling into the shrink tube of the VESC! :wink:

We decided to add additional heat shrink to this week's batch just to be safe.... but if you just got your vesc from us recently you will need to investigate this.

Not against buying it online, would rather just something I can pick up right away in stores.

there should be no issues with raptors, it's mostly in the big batches of VESC we are sending, if the +ve wire is on the pins when the shrink tube is _shrunk_... 


raptors are being built with just one cap board so we modify the wires

Yes that's exactly what I did see the pics below. Blue for Enertion :sunglasses:..  So that's all good you think? There was already a small puncture on the red cable but the VESC hasn't been in use at all just opened in fact.  I also had to remove part of the wrap already on the VESC to get to that cable part, is that okay too, having some of the VESC, the battery parts especially. Should I rewrap it again? Or is that good to go?

glue the wire into a position that prevents it from being punctured by the pins, or cover the pins with glue to prevent them from puncturing the wires... there is no exact method....

Okay, will do, so it's those wires under the red cable, I'll try get some hot glue refill tomorrow. Do you recommend rewrapping it though? Since I had to cut it to get to the cables.

Also, I won't be using those wires for anything yes? So glueing them is all good? Should be of course since you recommended it.

Oh so that's what caused my vesc to burn, I thought it was for FOC config, and/or battery or motor problem but probably it was this making them fail after 20meters/2km

just because there are marks does not mean it actually got punctured. I would still be pissed though if both my VESCs got blown so quickly.
But as far as I can see you don't have any insulation on the receiver pins as well - are you sure you did not get an accidental short with the pins touching the capacitor board?

I like this method too. IMO, I'd use flush cut pliers or flush cut end nippers. It should be way easier than whipping out the hot glue gun. Anyone could have this job done before the glue gun had time to heat up. 
I use these flush cut end nippers for my guitar builds. They come in handy for lots of stuff.

I would say it's likely punctured enough, due to the size of the pins and the thickness of the insulation it doesn't take much to pierce, one of the pierce marks on mine looks like that but my multimeter showed a connection without any pressure on it

I thought you were going dual with two VESCs - so only one would have the actual receiver pins covered.
You could also check with a multimeter just like @racidon did to be sure it got pierced.

WOW, that is a pretty bad and very obvious error. Not much thought or quality control gone into that before shipping them out.
Putting extra insulation is not a solution, all you are then doing is delaying the inevitable. Our boards endure heavy vibration all the time we are riding, Those pins will chew through any insulation over time.
As has been mentioned a few times already, the only real solution it to cut those pins flush - if you have a file to hand it would be good to round the cut off stubs as well.

Well and hot glue or epoxy. Also it does not matter if they "chew" through anything when the thickness is the same as the pin - there can then be no physical contact between wire and pin.
Just being a smartass here but you see there are pleanty of other solutions and it is not that big of a deal (at least to me)

Sure hot glue and epoxy are possibilities as well, but you are treating the symptoms and not the cause.
Personally I still think the best solution is to cut the pins flush, but hey - everyone to their own.
Not a big deal until your long awaited VESC dies on you due to a silly mistake that really should not have happened.
Great that is was pointed out quite early so hopefully not many problems have occurred.

## \#36 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2016-07-29T11:41:43.763Z Reads: 223

flush cut nippers would definitely work well. 

dremelling them down with a small sanding barrel would probably work well also as long as you mind the direction of metal dust spray (there's an arrow on the dremel that will tell you what direction the tool is spinning) and make sure the board is blown off completely before powering on, you don't want solder dust everywhere on the pcb when you fire it up. A small baggie and some tape would eliminate that issue completely. this would likely take less than 30 seconds and would leave a smoother, duller surface than nippers. 

coating the points in a fat  bead of hot glue also works when using a detail gun, the hotter guns will make the glue runnier and you'll have to apply it more than once as the glue will settle around the points during the first round. 

Shrink tubing or adding tape to the wires only delays the puncture, it will eventually still happen if the points are still there and the wire is still rubbing or pressing on them. 

This has pretty much always been a problem. My very first set of VESCs fell victim to this issue but didn't fail completely until later, which made the problem harder to diagnose.

***** If any of you decide to cut the pin or Dremel them down, be sure to redo the soldering on the pin. Because these process may cause Micro-Fracture on the solder. ****. Also, cutting pin on connector it is not something that is recommend by IPC standard, so always be careful and be aware that you may brake the connection internally. (the barrel inside the PCB)

Honestly, i don't know what will happen. 

The US manufacturer has said they will take responsibility for manufacturing faults only, so i suppose they need to make that decision about the cause of the fault once they investigate your vesc... They also mentioned they might be able to offer a reworking service if there proves to be lots of faulty units coming back....

But so far out of the 1000 we have shipped in the last few weeks there are not that many popping up with faults or that have been returned. so we are just going to wait & see what happens.

I think at this point it i should make it clear that all VESC have been programmed & tested spinning up a motor, if they fail that test they don't leave the factory in texas. If your vesc fails on the bench you need prove that it is a manufacturing fault.

My advice to anyone reading this, if you want a guaranteed working vesc and minimal downtime buy the [VESC-PLATINUM](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/vesc-platinum-inc-1yr-replacement-warranty/) it's the only VESC in the entire world that has a no questions asked replacement warranty & it is also very competitively priced & we are also now in stock permanently with free worldwide shipping.

if it's a VESC-PLATINUM it gets replaced, have you been talking with someone from enertion? if so its probably being processed now... they probably asked you to send it back so we can investigate it & see what the fault is..if it's something to do with manufacturing we can use the information to improve and/or prevent the issue in the future.

@onloop Like I said, I bought the "1 yr VESC replacement warranty."
My question is: will they repair it or replace it (in other words give me a new vesc)? I've talked to one (actually two of your guys: Jacob and Rick) and they recommended that I buy the warranty and send in my broken vesc (that I broke i.e., user error, but could have a manufacturing fault...I don't really know) If they repair it, great! If they replace the whole vesc, great! It doesn't really matter Im just curious.

[quote="WARMAN, post:60, topic:6805"]
Is this all vesc's?
[/quote]

in theory, this can happen on all vesc that have long pins remaining on the connectors, some vesc may be clipped shorter....

it just worth being diligent & considering the hazards no matter what vesc you have...... 

there are probably 10 other ways you can short your vesc that are more likely than this...

OK cool thanks Jason everything I have bought from yourself so far has been top notch! and enjoy the vlog's on YouTube great drone footage btw and insightful knowledge to building my own board! Where do you find the time for family/business/vlog's etc busy man! That whisky at the end of the day must taste extra good!

@warman - this issue isn't on our VESCs. Our pins are clipped and we have a thicker insulation on our wiring. You don't have to worry.

looks like you really need to put that vesc in a box and cut the pins down, in a box there would be less danger of wires being bent the wrong way and causing caps or wires coming into contact with other components.
just saying.

We also cut the pins short so this is not an issue with Ollin vesc's. I also know @elkick does the same before shipping his vesc's.

i noticed that too.

Also (and i apologize for not having pics to prove it, maybe i'll take some later) i successfully dremelled down the pins on four of my enertion VESCs this past weekend without compromising any of the solder joints. I just used a finer sanding drum and didn't apply any pressure. The dropped down immediately. You have to be very gentle and let the spin do all the work, and be careful about the resistors near the pins. I blue taped the units before doing it to keep the metal dust out and made sure the spin of the drum was throwing dust away from the board, not towards it. 

it took me about 20 minutes to do all four of them and heat shrink them as well.

Received my vesc yesterday with the heat shrink fix already applied from Enertion

Those pins certainly are pointy and can see how it would pierce the shielding. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f31507cb5285d8807f25f54747b46ba79838fb79.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

I hear a Dremel multi-tool (or similar) with the small circular file attachment works very well also at grinding them down - If you're careful (applying little to no pressure) and ensure the file is spinning away from the PCB.  Seems like the best option in my mind so you don't need to worry about the glue moving or becoming dislodged in the future. That or clipping them off, but I'd be worried about damaging the board so I'd personally go with the Dremel option.

Did you get your vesc repaired or replaced yet?
I had the same manufacturing defect and I sent mine in to the us supplier. He received it on the 1st and Linda told me on the 4th that she told them to send replacements. I still haven't heard anything back.

Thanks for the quick reply :slight_smile:.
I hope we get out replacements soon.
Brandon in Texas has had my units for two weeks today. I'm pretty bummed it's taking so long and would feel better with some more communication. I guess a good chunk of the lack of response is due to the limited enertion staff and the giant difference in time zones ( I send an email to enertion, 17 hours ahead of me, then they send an email to Texas, then Enertion gets a reply, then Enertion can finally reply to me). I'll stay cheery and keep my hopes up, but I'm upset I never even got to ride my board yet :frowning:.

Actually, they received my VESC on the 1st as well. So its been 2 weeks already.That sucks though, you didn't even get to try your board. I was lucky that my vesc had no issues. But after a week I switched to FOC and it worked flawlessly for like 15 miles of riding.

do you have the VESC-PLATINUM? or did you buy the warranty?

if so please email support@enertionboards.com and advise them of the situation so they can get your new VESC sent out.....

I am afraid if you have simply posted the VESC back to factory without any other formal steps taken you could be waiting a long time and nothing will happen..

I have spent many hours over the last few weeks developing procedures & training new support staff to assist with these matters...  please email again and i am sure you will get a great experience. (if not let me know)

I was wondering if an email would be recived with return shipping information after you file a warranty claim, I did not purchase the warranty, and believe the 60 day electronic return warranty would apply to my claim because it was the first use, I filed on the 9th, I know you and your team are very busy. Just courious if the status pending means ready for me to ship it back? I have contacted the support a couple times over the last few days with no definite awnser.

I didn't buy any warranty. I emailed support first thing after the problem occurred. Jacob told me to send them back with my original order list and the email conversation we had.
I assumed, that since he didn't tell me anything about buying a year of warranty, the 60 day warranty applied. I emailed support a couple of times since they last responded to me, I have been waiting for a reply.
Is there something else I have to do? 

Support already said this on the 4th "We are waiting on information from the factory. I have asked them to ship you 2 replacement units."

I just now realized that I can actually file a replacement request on the enertion website. I filed one, informing them of my current situation. I also realize this is what onloop meant in his reply to me, but it would have been helpful to have heard the information sooner.

The process is taking some time and it's getting hard not to be salty when I feel like my problem has been forgotten about due to the lack of response from support.

I'm going to try to hold out. I sent back two VESCs because they both stopped working on me, so I would probably have to buy two warrantys ($114). My wallet is already thin enough.

@onloop 

I still haven't gotten a reply from support. I emailed support this past tuesday. Maybe my emails got skipped over. Can I please get some sort of update either on here or to the email. My original request number is 10266 and I was order number 4302. I would greatly appreciate a reply.

I emailed support yesterday. They said they requested the warehouse staff to ship the vesc that day. Hopefully, they do the same for you. I ordered a new vesc from enertion (to use as backup if something go wrong or for dual drive) and it arrived 3 days later (which is great) but the manufacturer had my broken vesc for 3 weeks now and it seems like they forgot about it or don't know how to proceed with replacements!

What did you pay for the VESC? Because I saw they are $100 right now. I'm considering just buying two more, out of desperation.

I really don't understand why support refuses to reply to my emails. I've only sent three between now and the past two weeks. They could at least send me an email letting me know they are working on it, and not just ignoring me.
