If someone else has made them I think they wont be much cheap.. Usually expect to pay about 250-300 eur at least I think.

Cells alone probably cost close to 200 eur anyways. 36/40cells at ~4 eur a piece = ~160 eur + shipping.

+ spot welding
+ soldering
+ connectors & wires.

You might check @fottaz site. Then Alien power systems. Probably UNIK boards has some too.

Here's a direct link for fottaz shop and 10s4p pack:
