Yesterday I mounted the motor on the board and tested it with a single battery and the receiver and the remote. Everything worked fine. Today I mounted the rest and soldered everything together. The receiver gets power from the VESC but the LED is not shining anymore. I am sure its plugged in the right way. I also tried every possible combination.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/2/627c39995ca0d5bc74264bb6342bbf9ad9b25e77.jpg" width="375" height="500">
I also was extra careful and never shorted anything out. It actually was the last thing that was connected to the board.

No not really. I mean it just worked again suddenly. I have no explanation for it though. Just plug in in and out a couple of times or leave it for a while. It just worked again suddenly and never failed again. Don't ask me how and why :smiley:
