Hi, 
Ive got a Maytech 4.12 VESC where the C40 Cap sparks. The error ocurs every 2nd time I turn on my board. 
Any Idea why this might happen? 
There are no signs of damage on the VESC. 

Does anyone had this problem? 

Thanks in advance for the help :slight_smile: ![image|374x500](upload://kBmmr4roJg9g8GKYBXe2dHFuKnR.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://cD8fbZwxxAEOZSAKpfJ86cAWzFD.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://eSAGX8BObirg4uftPboYiRSRqK.jpeg)

C40 is sparking?  Is C9 also sparking?

What is the voltage on the input?  Does it spark when the batteries are half empty?

C40 can only do 10S, not 12S.  I don't recommend running the VESC at 12S anyway

Not on an actual battery?  Just on a power supply?

What does the voltage measure on the input wires?

Both on the 6s Charger/Power supply and input wires 25.2 V. 

It´s strange... now I did not spark, even after turning it multiple times on and off.

edit: on the battery it also happens sporadically

Oh man, these are the best problems to troubleshoot :smiley:

The ones you can't induce the problem on purpose, but rather seem completely random, because we don't know the reason yet for it.

C9 never sparked?

no... 
I just checked again, now it somehow died completely. For now I think we can close this thread till I figure what got damaged. 

Thanks for your help :)

Did you put a conformal coating on it? If so, can you post a picture of the bottle?
