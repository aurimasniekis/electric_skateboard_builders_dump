```
After recieving my new module for the photon I finally decided to install it.. little I knew i should have not ! Now i tried 3 different remotes and nothing works. 
I typed faults looking for errors 
Tried with and without CANbus 
With PPM and UART 
I just can‚Äôt get the motors to spin and i can‚Äôt see any pulsewidth displayed on the BLDC tool 

Please help me I have a group ride in a few hours it‚Äôs the first day of sun since decades !

That sucks! I am sorry for that. I hope someone can help you asap.

Otherwise one thing you can try is upgrade to the 3. Firmware. Either the normal one or Ackmaniac ( I am using the latest one). Then use VESC tool instead of BLDC tool for configuration. Maybe it will work out.

You should check inside thier thread. I mean is the most advance one, it should be able to. Otherwise it worth a try and you can use another remote for today.

max 60.000 min -60.000
Although focbox is known to handle more than that. I doubt you'll exceed 60k with that motor of yours.

Ackmaniac yes https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t7dl90owz5ccbyl/AAANyC-yQCMeveA7errNRnYqa?dl=0
download the ESC tool folder. Inside one is for Windows the other for mac.

don‚Äôt upgrade. i‚Äôve heard nothing but problems about 3.xx. reflash the vesc with your current fw. in the firmware tab of the bldc tool. redo all your settings and give it a shot.

btw erpm should be set to 60k just to be safe, also uncheck ‚Äúlimit erpm with negative torque‚Äù

[quote="Wajdi, post:635, topic:24654"]
I have been looking into this for the past few days, and I found the problem. I forked the bldc source code and applied necessary changes to get this working again. I will release a modified FW 3.34 tonight that should get cruise control, reverse, and nunchuck controls back on UART.
[/quote]

[quote="Wajdi, post:637, topic:24654, full:true"]
I just managed to have the controls compatibility issue fixed. The modified version is FW 3.35, thats the latest release, I made changes to fix nunchuck compatibility issues with the Photon receiver.

You can download the FW from my GitHub here https://github.com/wajdib/bldc/tree/master/build_all

Make sure to choose the correct hardware version, and the default FW available.

For this you will need the latest version of the VESC TOOL as well, V0.88.

This also applies to anyone that wants to update to latest vesc versions and have problems with controls or telemetry, this should fix it for the old Photon receivers.

Let me know if this works for you.

For those that need it and can make use of it, here‚Äôs a link to the previous releases of VESC Tool for MAC OS. [MAC VESC Tool Releases](https://github.com/rpasichnyk/vesc_tool/releases)

Did you download the modified firmware?

No i did not and was not aware of this issue. I will update my VESC with it and tell you if it works ! Hope it will
The weird thing is that even the gt2b don‚Äôt work anymore. 
Thanks for the mac version of the vesc tool
So i just should download vesc tool update the firmware re do all the parameters , motor detection etc

@ElskerShadow Dont upgrade to FW3 !
You will only face more problems.

Also I don't really see how the photon receiver would cause any of this, since PPM does not work as well it seems like a misconfiguration on your part.

Actually, in many European countries (maybe other countries as well), we use periods or a blank space where you use commas, and a comma where you use a period.

Therefore 60,000 = 60
And 60.000 = 60000 = 60.000,00 = 60 000
Lol
