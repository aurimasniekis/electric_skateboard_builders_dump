Hey all,

I've been slowly but surely making progress on my first build. Now that I've got all my parts here, it's just a matter of putting everything together. I'm using @torqueboards ESC (VESC 4.12 with firmware 2.18) and I can't tell where I'm supposed to connect my controller receiver and my motor sensor wires. If need be I can send a photo of the VESC. I can't seem to find a diagram anywhere on here but if I'm being an idiot please let me know. As always I appreciate any and all thoughts. Thanks a ton

-MH
