Post functional and bling, whatever works.

Edit: Intended use is off a compatible BMS or an anti-spark switch

As far as I understand, latching not momentary (needs to stay on) is what we need for esk8.

Here's some starters subject to revision on compatibility - wait for experts to comment before using my links: -

Are these for use with a switching BMS or anti-spark switch, because none of these can handle the current if you're thinking of placing them inline....

You might need resistor if your install switch with antispark as current can kill LED at least.

If it is to go with bms e switch then you should be fine. I'm connecting mine with 3.3V on the vesc to power up the switch led - works perfectly.

Yeah, I should edit the original post to clarify that. For use with a BMS or anti-spark

Another good point, the LED one would need to be rated for the voltage supplied by the BMS/anti-spark

Or you could use a resistor/voltage regulator and still use them if they're rated lower.

That's very true, thanks Kevin

Are you using a Bestech BMS with a SPDT (built in led) as the e-switch?

@karma Yes sir! Works very well. I wanted something better looking than just regular switch. Also it is waterproof ( I think ) and is made of Metal, very solid ;)

Would you mind linking the switch?

Like what Montpierre said if you use battery voltage to power 12v led use a resistor to regulate current and you'll be fine. Tried this the other day with a 12v led switch on 10s with a 2.7k 5w resistor. works great!
