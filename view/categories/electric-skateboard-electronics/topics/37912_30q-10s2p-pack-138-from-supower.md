Getting 2 of these. $75 express UPS shipping. Built in BMS. Lilian over at Supower confirmed the cells are 30Q. 

A 2 or 3 of these in parallel will make a good modular pack.

If you are using multiple packs, they have to be the same Voltage as each other. Otherwise you are damaging these batteries in a best case scenario.

I ordered without knowing of 30Q cells. I was content with the spec in the picture for the price and form factor. So, it was a nice surprise to get confirmation the cells are 30Q. I think they used to build this pack with another cell and haven't updated the info.

ok, you can judge me. haha I just wanted about 15A discharge cell in that specific form factor with BMS. They seem to manufacture good BMS so decided to give a shot. I was really curious which cell they use cuz I couldn't find that combo of 2500mah and 15A.

Why? Each bms protects each block of cells. One kicks in and the current spike on the other two will most likely trip them too. It's like using protected cells for a pack.

Many people are doing this with little ill effect. I can't explain how each BMS deals with the situation but it seems to work as expected. I'd learn more cuz I was wondering about hooking up two chargers at the same time for two parallel connected packs.

I've never actually tried it, but in theory it should work fine

If you hook up 2x 2A chargers in parallel, the total DC output would be 4A.  Even if the chargers have a 2.5A fuse, for example, you won't blow any fuses because the current through each charger is still only 2A.  It's the same concept as putting two batteries in parallel.  And the AC to DC conversion isolates the signal, so you could even put the AC plugs in parallel as well

Big no no!!!!
You will blow your chargers and potentially a fuse in your house. 

The chargers will never ever be at the same voltage and depending on how far off they are, one will charge into the other. The reverse flow of current will burn the charger and in turn create a short in your wiring. Depending on how good the circuitry is, you might get lucky and not burn anything else but you could start a serious fire...
