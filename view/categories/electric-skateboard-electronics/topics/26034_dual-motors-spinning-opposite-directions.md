I have two Torqueboards 6355 and I pull one motor off to do some maintenance, when I have put it all back together they both now spin in opposite directions? 
No idea what I have done, I'm sure it's an easy fix because I'm an idiot. Any help is appreciated.

Swap any two of the three motor wires around and you're good to go
