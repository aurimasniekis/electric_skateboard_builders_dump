Batteries are super expensive, I was wondering what the best balance between price, speed, and range I could get. I have a dual belt 5055 motor system with 90 mm wheels. I want to be able to easily scale hills and have a top speed of around 25 miles (40 km) an hour. I would like a range of 20+ miles. Any affordable complete batteries I could get?
