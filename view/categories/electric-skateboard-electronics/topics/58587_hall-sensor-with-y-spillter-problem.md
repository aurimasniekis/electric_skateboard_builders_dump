Made (2) Hall Sensor extensions for both my motors. Ran motor detections, everything worked and motors spinned perfectly. Once done configuring, I pull the trigger on the remote and nothing happens. So I reset everything again minus the hall Sensor and everything works. Can I not run hall sensors with y spillters ???
