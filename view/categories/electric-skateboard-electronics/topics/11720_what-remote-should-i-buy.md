Hey guys, I got a Steez remote, but it stopped pairing with the reciever when I switched to VESCs. Can't figure out how to fix it so I guess I'll be buying a new remote.

Right now it seems like I could get the new Enertion remote, but it seems like those are taking a while to ship. The winning remote looks nice, but I've heard a lot about it dropping out. There's also the GT2-B, and I have a friend with a 3D printer so I could mod it. I've also seen one that looks like the winning remote but a bit more square, Miami Electric Boards sells them but their out of stock, anyone know where else I could find one? And I'm not a huge fan of the nunchuck remote.

If there are any others out there let me know, but what would you guys recommend?

That's the one I was looking for! Sadly it looks like it would take a while to ship :frowning:

The remote is the last thing I need till can ride this and it's getting cold so I might order this off Amazon since it can ship in a couple days.

https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B00FS2U9BA/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1477193844&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&keywords=gt2b&dpPl=1&dpID=31mLTKR%2BCfL&ref=plSrch

Would I be able to do the bad wolf mod on this?

I have the mini remote in stock and ready to ship! $30 It's super reliable and almost no one has had problems with them.
https://electric-skateboard.market/product/2-4ghz-mini-remote-receiver/

Mods can take time, and I have ruined a few GT2B'S trying to remove the USB port. I'd say the mini remote is worth the extra $6 or so.

I ordered the benchwheel remote. Requires no modding, looks great as is and good reputation in terms of reliability. From what I understand it also has a button that allows you to put in some sort of 'beginner mode', not 100% sure though.

Thats awesome, should come in handy in the rain or when you let someone else on your board. To me this controller seems unbeatable for the price point.

I tried these controllers:
GT2B
Mini
Winning

I really like the Mini controller, I've never had lag as the winning and it's smaller than GT2B.

I'm going to order one but at the moment they are out of stock. The seller said in 5 -10 days the remotes will be in stock. At the moment I go with the Winning remote but even with coaxial antennas I had some drop outs so I don't trust it anymore.

What's the hight of the benchwheel remote?

Its been Great as far as I know for the past month. when 1 of my 2 belts snapped while going downhill i wasnt able to brake with the other motor (hence the bandaged arm).. I am not sure if this is due to the vesc, remote, motor, or belt that caused this. Sooo on the very odd chance that it was the remote losing connection.. im 99% happy with it.

we're you not braking at all, or was it very weak? Keep in mind when a belt breaks your braking power is cut in half.

It felt like nothing at all, however I was panicking at the time so it could have been half power. I think the chances that I got a dropout at that precise moment is pretty low

Just got my Benchwheel remote in yesterday and hooked it up. Just one quick ride so far down the street, but so far it seems to work great. No drop outs and feels good in the hand. Having the finger ring makes it feel pretty secure too. Set up was a breeze. Just plug and play.

To be clear, by flawless I meant that I've had zero issues with it losing connection with the ESC or anything related.  The trim dials are accurate and it feels great in your hand.  I've not used it with a VESC (only a Hobbywing Quicrun 150A ESC) so I can't comment in that respect.

Those options are actually pretty new, it used to say "remote" or "remote and receiver". Not sure why they have those "color" options now. My guess is the more expensive one comes with a receiver, but honestly, no one knows since they literally just changed the options on aliexpress. Best bet is to contact info@benwheel.com

Haha sorry, gotta make sure my builds have remotes for them. For thumb remotes, this would be the only remote I recommend. It's comfortable, has great throttle range, doesn't have connectivity issues, has 1+ week battery life, and, as an extra, has two acceleration/speed modes.

I don't recommend the winning remote at all since it caused me a few nasty scrapes, and while the nano-x is more reliable, it's just not very comfortable and the throttle range is very lacking.

Hey all, of the remotes mentioned in this thread, can someone comment on which ones have the most throttle range?  Somewhere around here, I saw where @longhairedboy likened the GT2B to an analog gas pedal feel.  Is the GT2B the only one with that quality, and do the various case mods impede that and its trim and cruise functions, in any way?

I'm coming from a Winning remote, which has been reliable, but I don't like the ultra short throttle travel.

call me crazy but i actually prefer the steeze to the gt2b at this point, although the gt2b actually does have a "wider", or less compressed throttle range. 

Also i kept cracking gt2b remotes wide open during tuck-n-rolls when i wreck my shit so i needed something that bounced more and shattered less. 

though i think the electronics in the gt2b may be more reliable.
