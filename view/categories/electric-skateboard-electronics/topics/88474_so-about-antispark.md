I know that an XT90 loop key is cheaper but other than that  are there any advantages of a loop key over a mosfet switch such as  this : https://www.amazon.com/DIYE-Electric-Skateboard-Anti-Spark-Longboard/dp/B07MTLV55T/ref=asc_df_B07MTLV55T/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=242024224022&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17680968625592172911&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9013193&amp;hvtargid=pla-630172930938&amp;psc=1

Mosfets will burn out with inrush current eventually. xt90s is a physical detachment that mitigates the current inrush spark.

That Anti Spark switch is garbage, any loop key is more reliable.  All Anti Spark switches will eventually fail, some immediately.  Typically an XT90-S loop key is good for 1500 + uses.

In short, when an XT90-S loop key fails you buy another $3 loop key and do 2 mins worth of soldering, your back running.  When an AS switch fails you have to remove the enclose from your board and replace the switch, that's expensive and time consuming.
