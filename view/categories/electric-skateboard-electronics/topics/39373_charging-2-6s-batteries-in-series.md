Is there some sort of 12s charger that can charge 2 6s batteries in series. Or a dual 6s charger thatâ€™s not extremely expensive.

```
You could always wire your 6s batteries in parallel, and do the same with the balance leads, and charge them with a 6s charger. It will probably be slow, doubling charge times. Your best bet is to get a battery management system

i can't really afford a 12s bms right now and im not the best with wiring

Then charge them one at a time... It takes work to get something nice. There are some group buys for 12s bmss often. A BMS will be much cheaper than any 12s charger

currently i am charging one at a time. it just takes too long to charge both of them seperately.

just get a parallel charging board

i hear it doesnt balance charge each cell properly and that its dangerous.

Then just buy 2 of the I max b6 copy chargers. Under 20$ each

i have 2 right now but i cant seem to find a decent charger. it takes like 12 hours to charge one of them

Do you have 2 imax`s? if your batteries aren't 30000 mAh each (Which they obviously aren't) it shouldt take 12 hours

i have 2 imax but i am only using one for each battery.
i am using a 2 amp powers supply but it only lets me go max 1.2 amps.

Ive done this. Vesc on the left, batteries right two. My connectors  are all antispark. My balance leads come out a little hole in my enclosure. 250w charger. You can either do them one at a time, or buy a fused parallel board. Oh ive also a temperature sensor connector, to stop charging if the temp exceeeds 30c.

A more powerful power supply is required as mentioned above.  Nothing wrong with parallel charging if you do it right.  I've been doing it for years and never had an issue.

i think im just going to buy a more powerful supply.
also can i charge a 5200 mah 6s 15C~30C battery at 5 amps?

```
All batteries are different. My 6s 30c ones are 2c (10amp) Ive seen much higher. 

Everyone recommends 1c. I charge 1.5c. My batteries only go 1-2 celcius over ambient temp.

Check out used chargers on rcgroups.com.  I picked up a 1000w charger and 750w power supply for $80shipped

Remember that you can only charge up to 2a on 6s/25.2v on the iMax b6

It can. Depending on battery voltage.

50w charger charging a 6s battery 25v.  50/25=2a

## \#24 Posted by: E1Allen Posted at: 2017-11-26T22:35:10.738Z Reads: 41

Then more amps. My 750w power supply can do up to 6s at 30a roughly. Which is more than enough for one battery.

But with a larger charger and a parallel charge board you can charge your like batteries together and faster

I use an cheap used 203 watt original xbox power supply off ebay with a Charsoon Antimatter 250W from banggood. Because the xbox power supply is only 12v this charger limits max wattage to arround 200w anyway.

Is it possible to have two 6s in parallell and charge them seperately ? Do you have a soloution for that?
I have a schematic for my version, would appriceciate if you could take a look at them

Just do what i did, but swap the series y adapter for a parallel y adapter?  the adapter acts as the loop key. Charge them with a single charger using a parallel charge board. 

Or are you try to use 4 batteries?

Im trying to use four batteries, where i want them in 6s2p. And i only have a 6s battery charger, and therefor i would like to charge them seperatly (charge 3s battery in series)  and not in parallell.
