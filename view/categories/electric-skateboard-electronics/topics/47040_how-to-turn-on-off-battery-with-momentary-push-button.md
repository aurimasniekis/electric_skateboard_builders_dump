I'm trying to switch on/off my board with a momentary push button, is there any way or any electronic component that allow me to do so?

I had some issues in the past with switches powering down on really crappy roads when cruising at high speeds.

What about the switch on the deck or the side of the enclosure or get that remote on off switch from turnigy and use ch2 on your remote?

Search for "soft latching switch"
@goldenhusky next version of antisparks could have this maybe?

There you go, didn't get time to finish to this yet but this weekend I'll give another go :

There 's no plug n' play module to use yet that's why I started this.
