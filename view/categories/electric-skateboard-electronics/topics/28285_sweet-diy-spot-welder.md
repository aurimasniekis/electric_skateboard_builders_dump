Ran across this on Hackaday, and now I need to build one.

It's fine, but it's just like the hundreds of microwave transformer DIY spot welders on YouTube, except this one uses a solid state relay to activate.

And uses a microcontroller to implement double-pulse welding which is fully customizeable.

Why add complexity, this is what I use :smiley:

Nah, momentary switch in the hand. The copper rods can be held in one hand...

This is a really cool design. Simple enough, yet with some great features. I've been looking into building my own welder, because the Sunnko 788+ that I bought isn't powerful enough to weld through some of the thicker nickel strip available. I would rather have heavier duty strip for better current transfer, but also for a bit more mechanical strength. I want to build one of these and see what kind of jigs I could make to make the job that much easier. Love this design!!

Very nice!! That is a beautiful pack! Looks like those welds are really clean. Are you using heavier gauge nickel strip?

0.15mm but actual pure nickel, not nickel plated steel...
