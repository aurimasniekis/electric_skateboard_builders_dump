Hi, I'm using adc throttle control for a vesc 4.12.
It's been running flawlessly for around 12 months now. (Running Ackmaniac 3.103)

Lately My throttle has Lost all effect when I turn on the vesc. The only way to get it working again is to plug in the laptop and go to adc tab and re-do the throttle mapping. Then it works fine.

Once I've recalibrated it will work fine for the rest of the day (I can turn it on and off several times and it's fine). However, if I leave it for a few days I have no throttle again.

Has anyone experienced this or have any idea what may be the cause?
