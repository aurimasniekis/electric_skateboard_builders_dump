Hello. I have three 3S 5000ma/h Li-Po batteries and I want a bms so that I can just plug a cable and charge them. I don't want to care about charging and balancing the batteries with the Imax B6, it is too heavy and big to carry always with me. I have been searching for a 9S bms and I have found some cheap options on Ebay, but as far as I know they are not recommended because they fail and you can burn your batteries. Can anyone help me please?
