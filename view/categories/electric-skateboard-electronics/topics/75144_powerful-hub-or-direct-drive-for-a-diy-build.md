I want to convert my longboard to electric on a moderate budget, but motor mounts and hardware add a lot to the cost. Are there any hub motor or direct drive options with good torque I could run on 10s or 12s?
Raptor 2.1 hubs and carvon direct drive systems only seem to be sold with boards, anyone know where to get those or similar as standalone products?

There is no way to have great hubs or direct drive on budget.

What is your budget for the drive train excluding ESC, battery, deck, enclosure?

I highly recommend hummie hubs, he might be sold out but ask @Hummie. They are going to run you $500 but for that price you are getting some abec 11 centraxes. They are really nice to ride and I personally dont miss having full thane like on belt drive setups. They also on 12s go 30+ mph and accelerate faster than raptor hubs. They are definitely worth the cost in my opinion.

Another option is to build your own hubs/ direct drive. You will need to be able to have access to a lathe though for adding a bearing to one side. The rest should be able to be done with basic tools and maybe a drill press. It will obviously take more time and require a lot more work but can be done for much cheaper and a great fun project for a diy enthusiast. BTW I’m in high school still so that gives a rough idea of my skills, I’m no engineer or anything like that I just like to tinker with shit and now esk8s

I got these hub motors (the non replacable):
http://www.diyeboard.com/replaceable-pu-dual-hub-motor-9055mm-500w2-power-truck-kit-p-671.html
I have ridden like 1000km if not more on these and they only have some wear on the sides of the rubber. I'm sure these rubber pu sleeves can do like 2000km until you need to swap them.

I run them with the ownboard esc so that's only 20A (10A each motor).
I red they could handle max 25A for each motor with no problems.
It would be awesome to use a dual vesc for these hubmotors.
I'm sure a 12S battery and a flipsky dual vesc would give great performance with these hubs.

I have the same one from diyeboard and I have use them at 10s for months. Now one month at 12s, 50A per motor and they are fun :grin:

That would be sweeeeet, raptor hubs will probably cost a fortune though.

Just talked to hummie and his hubs will be on the top of my list for my build. Where did you get the $500 figure from?

Maytech 90mm black hubs are very high quality. I love mine. I spent 500 on two hubs, two vescs, and both trucks and front wheels

Steelhubs.com said there was an option for $270 that is aluminium and hummie said his new hubs would be around the same price. Did you get steel?

The thing is hub motors compact a lot into a little space. Parts need to fit perfectly in very tight spaces. Most will cheap out on quality and you’ll pay for that later. You either buy quality once or buy cheap over and over.

Now the problem too is everyone has a different definition of powerful. I don’t consider May tech or koowheel hubs to be high power by any means for example. I feel safe say you could do 2500 watt continuous per motor with hummie hubs without significant heat build up, and probably more. Just haven’t been able to test it yet.

There isn't enough load for my hummies to maintain high wattage. Simiply not possible.

I do 1500 watts con quite frequently per motor. I am just simply limited by the vesc's I'm using (4.12's) to go higher. I have yet to break 155 F, even on steep uphills for over a mile.

I would suggest trying some hubs before you buy -  for me I just can't get past the 15mm (or around that) of thane.

If you ride on smooth straight roads you'll be fine and value for money is good, and perfect to get a taste of eSk8!

BUT if you expect cornering at speed to 'feel similar' to your current wheels the only options are 'real wheels' and belt/direct drive.

All that said I still need some @Hummie hubs in my life LOL :slight_smile:

Are you USA? I went in on a group buy for the Mad Hubs setup by @rey8801 . I paid $310 total with shipping. Still brand new, 75kv, comes all setup to plug into vescs. I’ll sell you these for what I paid and you pay shipping. I’ve been wanting some hummies so I’ll either sell these or end up with two hub builds.
