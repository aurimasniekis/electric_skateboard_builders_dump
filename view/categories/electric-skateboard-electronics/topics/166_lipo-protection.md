After doing some post-purchase reading on LiPos, I now kind of regret not going with a s.p.a.c.e cell and also never want to charge my batteries. 

That being said, to avoid a not-small cash-wasting, I think I still plan on building version-one using the parts I ordered, including the LiPo's. 

From what I read, having them on the bottom of the board can be dicey though. It seems like a good place to pick up scrapes and impacts which could turn into problems when charging later on. 

Is having them inside an ABS (or similar) housing safe enough? Does anyone do anything stronger? Or have I made the rookie mistake of reading too much internet about this?

I have 4 functioning boards right now, all with lipos on the bottom. Not sure where you're planning on riding or your riding style, but I have yet to damage a cell. I did at one point roll up and over a steep transition and bonked an abs enclosure, but aside from the subtle rash on the cover there was no damage to the batteries. If you can go space cell you should just for the ease of charging. If you don't though, you'll find with a methodical approach, a good charger, a balancing board and a little patience lipo really isn't that big of a deal.

Good to know. Do you put them into the fireproof bags for charging?

If I had a malfunctioning cell I would. (Sometimes a cell drops lower than the rest) I have a couple of those bags but, don't always use them. Do you have a cement floor in your garage? I have a 3x3 space I use in the shop to charge. If you use them all the time it doesn't hurt.

If you have a damaged cell though just don't charge the battery. Dispose of it properly. Pretty sure thats where people get in to trouble.

That's one thing that does concern me. We live in a townhouse so there is no garage or concrete floors. So it would be charged inside or on the front doorstep. My neighbors would be pretty bummed if I burned the building down because I didn't want to push my skateboard up hills!

It sounds like a failure is rare. But a space cell is now on my list to upgrade to sooner than later. More volts and a longer range won't hurt either. I can always sell the LiPo's and charger if it's like-new, I suppose.

besides the lipo bags - a good alternative to charge in is a pyrex or big ceramic bowl.

Pyrex can be a bit $, so i keep planning to swing over to a local value village or similar in my area to get one used off their shelf.  be really cheap and should work well.

I have the temp probe as well for my iCharger - the idea being that any lipo will show significant heat before it's truly a problem and the temp probe will automatically stop charging.

HTH - GL!

I always have my LiPo's on the bottom of the board, haven't scraped on yet.
just get yourself a $2 lipo alarm so that you don't over discharge them. thats the golden rule.
never over discharge!
as long as you don't over discharge and then try to recharge again lipos arent really that scary.
and never leave them charging unattended.

Enertion SPACE Cell is a great carefree pack that has laptop style charging easily available.

However, lipo's aren't as bad as you think. I literally have over 20-30 packs just laying out. Of course, I have the packs in series and in a 7/8/9" tablet case (purchased on ebay for about $1/ea) and the connectors on one side each to prevent a short.

IF you want to be safe. Just don't charge unbalanced packs. Use a battery medic and/or a voltage meter to check the voltage of each cell. If they are too far apart don't charge them.

I've never had a problem with LiPo either. It made me nervous at first, but after a while it was fine. My battery stays in my board's enclosure and i use an external port for charging. At the moment the pack is suspended in the box using hot glue at all four corners, so there is about a 1/4" gap between the pack and all sides of the box. It helps absorb some of the vibration and also allows the box to take a hit without passing damage on to the cell. 

I also have a volt meter on the outside of my box to tell me where i'm at at all times. I have a 6S, so its charge to 25, store at 22 and get off the board at 20. In fact the battery is probably the only thing I have had zero issues with. 

I'm probably going to move the volt meter to the nose of the deck so i can see it while i'm riding instead of relying on performance characteristics to tell me when its time to stop and look.

Awesome question; there are a lot of horror stories on the web with people frantically running from fires! I've watched about 30 "how to charge your lipo" videos on youtube at this point, similarly wanting to avoid an expensive accident. I also read and re-read my charger's manual

What I've picked up is that as long as you balance-charge your lipos correctly, and they are not physically damaged, they are very stable. It seems that when they are overcharged and punctured/dented: that is when trouble occurs. 

I will keep mine enclosed in some kind of box while riding, always use my balance charger with the temp monitor, and always charge in the safety bags and monitor the charging as it is happening. Based on all the feedback I've seen, this is enough to use them confidently.

Just a thought, VESC has a built-in "Adjustable protection against
Low input voltage" but I'm not sure that it includes and alarm.

Also, AFAIK, over-discharging lipos negatively impacts their performance but I do not believe that it poses a safety threat. Still a very good idea to monitor voltage to avoid over-discharge.

Really good tips. I actually am awaiting a VESC so that's also nice to know that it has a built-in low voltage protection. 

My concerns were compounded initially by the fact that I went with 8S batteries and there really isn't a normal off-the-shelf way of charging them, it seems! They have two 4S connectors each so I suppose I need some kind of balance board just to charge a single pack. From what I can tell, that's almost impossible to find in-stock... 

I ordered a volt meter lipo bag too to be safe.

Which 8s is it? Some of them are just two 4s packs physically connected with heat shrink, but they function separately for charging (you charge each like a 4s) and then connect them in series to use on the road.

There's this:
http://www.usastore.revolectrix.com/Products_2/Cellpro-10XP_2/Cellpro-10XP_310

It allows you to charge a single 10S pack (or 8S of course) or two packs up to 5S each. 

I found it this morning when I was looking for a companion for Turnigy's newish 10S 5Ah pack.

Hmm, It looks like it only has one set of charge leads, so it's not the "two batteries glues together" style I suspected. There are some notes from other buyers on the listing on HK. It seems that you can buy a balance board for ichargers that will work.

Yes. I saw that this morning while making my usual "what's available this week" rounds  and about shit my pants. Its no space cell killer, but its definitely a less expensive option if you don't care about charging convenience or a super slim enclosure. Two of these in parallel would be serious business, but at that point you may as well get a space cell since you'd have to get a charger too and for a battery this size you're looking at $150 and up for a charger.  And a bigger box under the board, but it could still be a sexy build if the box received the proper application of curves or angles. Options are always good. 

Also you could re-pack this cell to be two side by side cell stacks instead of a single vertical cell stack and you would save some ride height when just using the single pack.

It's very cool, but I don't exactly understand the draw of this compared to just using two 5s nano's. Wouldn't that be easier to charge and more flexible in terms of arrangement? Couldn't we just as easily mount them in this configuration?

...by easier, I suppose I mean that the charger is more common and less expensive in the 2x5s config.

Maybe I'm being cheap at the cost of elegance?

Somebody please correct me if i'm wrong because i've not actually had any real experience with running multiple packs in series.

I don't think you will be able to charge both 5S packs in parallel anyway without removing them or messing with your wiring when using something like a  6S charger. So because of that, it becomes a sort of usability issue to run multiple packs in series. If you have a 10S capable charger then you can use both balanced charge ports and the series'd outputs as the discharge mains and go about your business, but with a pair of 6S chargers or even a Dual 6S charger you're going to have to take those packs out of series and use the individual discharge mains on each charger. Running multiple packs in parallel, however, allows you to charge in parallel over a single set of connections. 

I have heard of people using shunts between the discharge ports to go from charging mode on series'd rigs to ride mode, so to speak. I probably wouldn't sell a complete using that method because people who buy completes just want to ride and don't want to concern themselves with how not to start a fire. For the owner of their own home built DIY rig though, that's fine and a lot of people do it.

Thanks @longhairedboy. In my first build, I'm planning to just remove the batteries and charge them individually.

I would give a long, sincere e-hug to someone who could write a tutorial on wiring a lipo (or 2 lipos in series\parallel) such that I could leave them inside an enclosure and charge them without having to disconnect and remove them from the board.

I know there are a few ways to do it (either with a BMS connected to the series, or some kind of "shunt" as @longhairedboy describes), but I don't think I've seen a tutorial or pictorial that really demonstrates how to set it up. 

Anyone? Bueller?

Thanks @lox897 this would allow me to charge multiples (although my current charger doesn't support that)... What I'm really curious about is how to wire the batteries so that once the they are "installed" in an enclosure, they are accessible to charge and balance without disconnecting wires to protect the ESC. For now, I'm going to use an enclosure that is easy to open so I can just charge them on my bench, but eventually I'd like to keep them mounted and just be able to charge them without any disassembly. Of course, @onloop 's  space cell would take care of all of this :smile:

I'm pretty sure that once the main discharge leads are wired in series there is no way to isolate them for charging/discharging without disconnecting the batteries from each other. However, you could mount a switch that does exactly that on the box alongside the dual charging ports. Problem is though that if that switch is in the wrong position when you go to charge bad stuff may happen.

Right. That works because 1) that's essentially a 6S pack like you said and 2) 6S chargers are pretty common. Once you try going to 8S via 2 4S in series or 12S with a pair of 6Ss in series you start having problems getting it charged due to a lack of inexpensive chargers. That's when you have to start disconnecting things and it gets annoying. 

This is where the space cell solves a whole mess of problems. Its also why somebody needs to develop a small, cost effective BMS for doing this kind of thing with LiPos.

```
so I cut the black wire off one of the packs and then re terminate the 2 balance leads to one JST-XH 7 pin on the ouside of the box.
(the reason you cu off one of the black wires is because the positive of one of the batteries becomes the same as the negative of the other battery when you join them in series.

you could use a lead like this one:

+1 for a "small, cost effective BMS" @longhairedboy I've been trying to find something but the descriptions of small BMSs are laughably bad! I can't sort out what most of them do! It seems like there are products that can handle this, but they aren't marketed too esk8 builders (yet).

This looks nice @lowGuido ... I'm impressed with the accuracy of the Dean's connector port that you cut. This is a great solution for 6S! I wish I knew how to work w CF. I looked at at plastic sandwich container this morning and thought "I wonder if *this* could enclose my electronics ands battery," :sob:

I still have almost a gallon of that stuff and i'm tempted to keep using it until its gone. Or until my wife leaves me and the neighbors move away or the SWAT shows up thinking i have a meth lab in my garage.

I used it to make my box and fill in the channels after in-laying my motor wires. 

I almost died from the funes and my wife is still complaining. 

I was in the garage, with the giant garage door open, and had a fan. 

Also it tends to warp and flake a bit.
