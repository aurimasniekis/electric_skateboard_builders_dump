Hello everybody. Right now I'm looking for a good charger for my esk8. I currently have a 6s bms, powered by two 3s 5000 mAh LiPo's in series. Those LiPo's are connected to a 6s 12A BMS. I had a charger first, but it was slow and I broke it by letting it slip out of my hands. So right now I'm looking for a new affordable charger. And with that I was wondering what the most powerful safe charger is for my set-up.

P.S. Does anybody know how to calculate charge time?

What is the max charge rating of your Lipo ? I guess it's 2C but you need this exact information if you want the fastest charger for your setup.

Recommendations differs from people to people. Mine are 0.5C to 1C is ok, 0.8C is the best IMO.

Keep in mind my sk8r dude that the faster you charge your batteries the less cycles they can support.

Lipos are fine up to 2.5c... you should see my 44ah field charging pack that I charge at 110amps. Lipos take charge alot easier then li-ion and typically have half of the IR a Li-ion does...if not lower..

Liions I try to stay under or around 1c....

According to hobbyking it can charge max 5C.

@bartroosen12 They look nice, but for my budget they are really expensive and I don't really know if my set-up can support such a charge.

These are power supplies, not chargers.
They will not work unless your batteries incorporate a charging circuit . Most eskates have a BMS so you should be ok.
I am afraid if you want to charge lipos properly you will have to fork out some cash and get a decent charger.

Is that a marine type lead acid battery?
These have a very low IR and can charge and discharge at very high currents.
I use a 1600kva generator, 2x modified server power supplies and a 1344W charger to charge my lipos at 4-8C without any ill effect to the batteries. When time permits I go for the lower charge current though.

Nice.
I fly RC helicopters but I needed a generator because my 700 uses up 2x 6S 5000mAh batteries every 6min.
That means that if I want to fly for more than a few times I need a generator or a couple of big capacity marine type lead acid batteries (and these weigh a lot more than my generator).

If your batteries incorporate some sort of BMS then yes.
An intelligent charger on the other hand gives so many more options.

It's an old discussion but u can charge fine w a power supply.
It just need be regulated.  
Balancing can be done on side

I have already agreed with you as far as electric skateboards go.
However I would love to hear how I can charge my 1S, 2S, 3S, 4S and 6S lipos of various capacities with a power supply without a charger.

I've got an adjustable 8amp power supply.  Just have to make sure not over charging cells. Generally.  I've had discussion many times now.  CV and cc are not so important.  Must be regulated supply.

You can't.  Not w the standard power supply without. Current control.  Typical power supply just a constant voltage.  Maybe get a drok or something to control current

That's just a charger? I have used these in all my builds, off course the batteries needs a bms for charging. You won't connect them directly to the batteries. I use a 6S2P lipo pack (10Ah) with a 6S bms (12A max charging current) works perfect for me

Look in the discription, there are only 2 pins connected. You can choose different types of connectors, just leave a message to the seller when you buy which you want ;)

That's the point he's making... Can't charge a lipo without a bms... Can't install a bms in those batteries because they won't fit on aircraft.

Ie it's not safe to charge with a power supply and no bms..

In esk8 just install a bms. But the general idea here is don't charge lithium without a balance circuit/over voltage circuit. And if your using a bms, don't use a charger with a current rated higher then said battery can handle.

I charge lipo without bms all the time. But its not just me and pretty common on diy bikes. To each their own.

On a hobby charger with a balance function, I hope. If not, good luck, hope you don't burn your house down.

Just a power supply w balance discharger on the side works for many people n u can get the balance discharger at hobbyking or elsewhere for about 15
.  If u look at rcgroups in the fire section faulty balance chargers are responsible for a lot of fires.  
As long as ur aware of the voltages before charging n check while charging n charge somewhere safe...that's considered safe enough by many. N bms aren't failproof either

So you have a balance function. That's the same thing as temporarily hooking up a BMS except there's no over voltage protection. That's a perfectly fine way to charge..

But you still cannot charge without a balance function, well you can but your risking fire. Don't advertise that it can be done without a balance function, that's just dumbassery.

I think we can cap your discussion by saying YES you CAN charge w/o an expensive charger and just use a balance discharger. BUT That's prob. not the best to recommend to most of the people here. It is most definitely a more dangerous option and less plug and play.

Hummie has that way, read his posts above to learn more, otherwise a slightly safer route is by getting a more expensive balance charger.

If I spend hundreds (even thousands) of dollars on batteries I will make damn sure I will use the proper equipment to charge them and not risk damage to the batteries or my property.
Having the ability to adjust parameters such as the maximum charging voltage per cell allows for increased life and performance of the battery.
Still a power supply (even an adjustable one) cannot charge all the types of batteries as exhibited in my previous post.

But you have a effectively a 5Ah 6S....

Charge at 1C-2.5c
C= capacity

So you need a 6s charger, 22.2v/25.2v that provides
 5Ah * 1C = 5A
 upto
5Ah * 2.5C = 12.5A

But where's info saying slow charging at one or two c is better? (Battery univ i dont trust).  Because often the cells are labeled for way more and I've read fast charging isn't bad unless the cells get warm and it is largely the heat that indicates the damage.  ..but the high voltage will damage.  Often cells will be quick charged. That's common. Safe. And possibly not any more damaging than slow charge. I've read its generally better butgactuslstidies showing it I don't see ..and often big biz wil do fast charging.
But I'm done. You've heard it from me before

That links you posted are really nice chargers, just a bit noisy for me, but interesting is that you can adjust the volts and amps to your suits, it has 3 pots where you can regulate volts up to 17s and up to 8 amps and the last pot don't know what it does. 
If someone has interest I can put pictures.
