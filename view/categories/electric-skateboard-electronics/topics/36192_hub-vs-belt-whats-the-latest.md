Hi all,

Inspired by some of the amazing build threads on here I'm planning to build myself an electric longboard.

Currently reading up on boards, batteries, and motors, but there doesn't currently seem to be an clear winner between hubs vs belts. It sounds like a year or 2 ago belts were the obvious way to go. but with new hubs being developed its now less clear cut.

I'm 70 Kg
live in a medium hilly area
would like to hit 25 Mph
and want to keep it under £500 (I'm good at finding deals!)

Would be keen to hear your thoughts?

I dont have any low end belt drives so I cant comment those but Ive seen many people that make it work, low end hubs all have major issues though. If thats your bugdet then a single drive belt set up is probably your best bet I dont recommend single drive hubs as they will all get hot from my experience, even if you are light.

I'll tell you straight up what the latest is.

Belted systems Rock! 
No urethane falling off
No broken axles
No bolts backing out and cutting phase wires
Climbing everything in sight without overheating.

Shit! What was that? I just ran over a handle.

Hummies v4 motors are the only ones gaurenteed to have no axle breaking issues (12mm instead of 8, over 20 times as strong), no wheel falling of or deformation issues (thanks to our high heat core), great rebound with almost as much urarhene as a non hub motor wheel (only 15% less).

For $450 for 2 motors, maybe out of your price range, but more torque then a dual drive belt with equivalent gearing.

We have solid working hubs, that will last Just most do not.

The noise claim is really debatable. Plenty of DIY belt/chain drives that run really quiet. The less moving parts thing is a cool bit of trivia, but realistically the belt drives are proven reliability. I've definitely seen my fair share of hubs motors burning out due to heat , vibrations due to thin urethane, or both.

True, but at the same time here I am with a broken set of Jacobs. Ultimately, size is the bigger decider of how much abuse hub motors can take. However it's undeniable that hub motors take on much more abuse and vibrations than belt drive motors, and thus you are bound to have more hub motors fail from a statistical point of view.

Hehe. It looks to me that you have decided for the motors that you want. Anyway, 500 $ build with quality parts  is a hard challenge.  Hobbyking.com has a set maby you should look it up. Have heard good words about it.

I'll agree a 500$ build is hard if you want a reliable setup. However I still think you are better off with a cheap belt/chain drive setup rather than a cheap hub motor setup. I had a 6374 single drive that worked wonders for most inclines. Hummies are the only hubs I would really consider at this point, if you still want to go with hub motors.

What gearing?  Hubs are 1:1 and not adjustable.  There is no way a hub can beat the torque of a belt drive unless it has a 250mm wheel wrapper and weighs 3 stone LoLz

I have done some research and came out with these result. True or not true this is my opinion. Does not have to be yours or others. I don't either sell hubs, or other motors so I'm totally unbiased. I did not say wich one is better in general I just pointed some pros for hubs in my opinion.
 Now:
Hub pros :
Clearance. -Yes unless you mount belt motors in the back or top of your board. 
Cleaner look. -Yes by a mile. 
Les noise. - yes, motor is enclosed and not open, in adittion to les moving parts, where each of them makes noise on itself. 
Les moving parts. -Okay, got me there
No belt wear/break. - It's true.  How often it happens is other thing. 
Pushing it with empty battery possible. I can do it. Not as easy as a normal board but possible. At least on flat ground.

If I did insult you or your beliefs I'm sorry, but every one has the right to share its thoughts.

Sounds like you're asking from the UK. 
Most people who are replying are from the US and will have access to much cheaper parts than us here in the UK.
For your budget you will most probably end up with a lot of clone parts. Possibly better to go with one large 6374 motor and a quality vesc and work from there.
Motors you can get from hobbyking, where for your budget you'll most probably be buying lipos too.
https://street-wing.com is a new UK based shop so you can get an idea of what you can conveniently get for your money.
With some thrifty buying and making parts/searchig for 2nd hand parts you might get something made!

Well to elaborate more for you, what '' I think''(can't stress it enough)  he meant is that for a belt driven system that would have the same high speed range the tourqe will be the same. If it's true or not we will have to wait and see. Now it depends a lot on wich motor you have but you have limitations with belt motors also if you go dual.

In a hub drive, you're also stuck with the wheel wrappers it comes with and the gear ratio (1:1) it comes with

Not recommended unless you disconnect the phase wires from the Vesc.
Manually pushing with motors connected can damage the Vesc.
On belts drives, the belts can be easily removed in about 2 min with a simple skate tool and then your free wheeling.

Thanks for all the info. 

It seems like Belts still has it. I'll go for a single 6374.
I guess the electric motor design has been refined for years now whereas hubs are only just being developed.

In terms of batteries, I'm hoping to get hold of some new'ish 18650s and make a 10S(2 or 4)P

@bigben , yes I'm in the UK, good point. Can that make getting hold of parts hard?
Are their any other UK forum member that have stock and sell on here?

I might start a build thread to track progress.

@mason I see that you come from Texas a place that I relate with high temps in the summer(whole year). Lots of people talk about hubs getting warm. I'm guessing hot pavement does not help the case.
I live in Norway, pretty cold place. And never had problems with that. But that is my experience, so read a bit more about it.
But remember the main problem with meepo board was the battery. Whatever you do, don't use that one. It is a pack of Samsung 22p (low-end cells) they will damage the whole experience because of sag.
There is a board deck producer in the USA, that makes something like loaded decks that I would suggest, http://www.customskateboards.com/Blank-Longboards/Blank-Freeride 
if you are on a budget so that you can buy better battery instead.

You can PM @Hummie and he'll set you up with them. Looking at about a month till we get the next 100 motor parts. From there out for a little, should have some inventory. Depends how quick they fly off the shelves I guess :)

More support will help speed up the process as we'll be able to order more magnets and other parts at once, instead of in smaller batches.

I think what everyone has to remember is that we're all entitled to our own opinion, but not to our own facts.

One thing I've noticed though (and I'm not claiming it's fact) is that rolling resistance is better on a belt drive than hubs. I always heard the contrary though. When I release the accelerator on a belt drive the transition between power and coasting is smooth. With hubs, you get a slight jerk when decelerating. I could be wrong though. 

It got me thinking though. Shouldn't belt drives have less resistance considering the wheel pulley is spinning the motor at a slightly less revolution relative to the wheel speed - compared to  a 1:1 ratio of a hub drive?

I've seen rolling resistance tests on youtube too showing belt drives rolling further than hub drives.

Thats beacuse most hubs have crappy urathane. We did a roll test today and 4wd V3 carvons out rolled a dual 6355 board without a doubt.

On a 10 mile leg of the 20miles we rode today, my 4wd Carvon board averaged 13.2 whr/mile which was lower than the belt drives consumption which was closer to 15.

The belt drive efficiency claim was not evident during todays ride. Also consider that the belt drive had an 80lb weight advantage and was geared to a much lower top speed. Both boards were 12S and on superfly's and tracking efficiency with the vesc monitor app.

Im gonna go ahead and call this "Direct drive is less efficient " myth debunked for my own purposes, and make a new claim that belt drag causes greater losses than many belt drive users are willing to admit. The data and comparisons we did today have convinced me that most of the losses in hubs have come from rolling resistance from low quality or thin urathane.  

I havent heard of any 40mph belt drive boards that will average under 15whr/mile especially not with a 280lb rider on a 10mile trip. 

Anyone have evidence to prove otherwise?

The efficiency on the hubs was really good I'm surprised. For the the first 3 miles we did when I had fresh legs and was more on the throttle I got 21whr/mile + the next 7 mile (~10miles) I got 17whr/mile then by the end of the 19 mile ride I was down to average 14.8whr/mile. So by end of the day I was easier on the throttle and effeciency went up.

You have four hubs that are "geared" for 60mph unloaded and I have two belted 6355 motors geared for 34mph unloaded and braking I would say I had the edge. But I wonder if you had two hubs wound for my top speed would braking and acceleration be as good. That would get my interest

Was a fun ride. We should do another comparison

You know, you have to be careful here. As most of people are using belt driven motors. They don't like the fact that there are also some advantages with hub motors.
Anyone who has had physics at school knows that less moving parts means better efficiency.
If I'm not wrong in car industry we have something called horse power, and break horse power. Where horse power is power measured on wheels, while break horse powered is power produced by engine before transmission loss(~15%).

There are some advantages to hubs, but efficiency isn't one of them. True, in a sterile test environment with an unloaded hub vs belt drive at a given RPM, the hub will probably win out due to no losses from the belt. However throw in a load, stop and go traffic, wind resistance, hills, etc and the gearing potential from a belt drive train easily outweighs any efficiency the hubs had over belts.

Yaaay that's what I wanted to hear. Although both are technically single speed, belt driven systems have an advantage in tunability. The fact you can change your gear ratio to find a sweet spot in efficiency is awesome. IMO the motor's ability to run at an ideal rpm for the majority of the time outweighs the mechanical deficiency of moving a belt around. Besides, belts are very efficient! I love belt driven stuff.

Real talk though I want to see a really head to head comparison. Hubs have great potential but at this moment I favor belts cause they're just so much more accessible and reliable overall. Someday when a really solid hub design that can be purchased by the majority of the market I will be impressed

But I think that's why carvon hubs are more efficient they take concepts from both belt and hub motors, they lack the inefficiencys such as cooling and and bad urethane, but lack the bad parts of a belt drive such as resistance, my single v2 had more range than my single enertion 6374 belt drive, I do agree however though that hubs have a long way to go until they can be better than belt drive but I personally and from what I have actually felt beneath my feet believe indirect drive is perhaps more efficient

What were the ride conditions like during the 10 miles? Lots of stop and go or consistent speed. 

There are also a lot of other factors too, belt tightness, use of an idler, how each rider handled the throttle. You may have just been traveling at a more efficient speed for your setup than than the other rider so -- for your use case the efficiency claim may be moot if you're always in the sweet spot for your setup. 

I don't have evidence myself unfortunately but I get low whr/mile in stop and go city traffic and I accelerate/brake aggressively. I also have low rolling resistance with use of an idler. I am geared lower top speed so it's probably not a fair comparison. It's really difficult to compare likes here without getting a dyno like @Blasto has. Unfortunately the thread below hasn't been updated, he's probably too busy.

This statement is very misleading. Try pedaling up a tall hill on a unicycle, then pedaling up a tall hill on a geared bike and come talk about efficiency. Gearing makes a drive more efficient for the load being demanded which is why your car has a transmission in the first place. We're not riding in hermetic environment.

Its belts, man. Until @Hummie  finishes his Duke Nukem hubs, its belts. Just forget about hubs for now. Direct drives look promising though. Carvon has some good shit happening. 

But still belts.

Belts win for me because I need versatility. I can take my drive train and switch to any motor I like. I can also tune my drive with different ratios. I can switch to any wheel I like, I am not pigeon holed into using a truck with generic geometry. I can tune EVERYTHING!

Or maybe a  swappable stator in a direct drive config. That would work for me too. But who the hell is going to design a swappable stator cartridge? And how would that even work?

yeah. Belts. 

until i get my solid lithium boosters finished anyway. I'm working on a new battery pack that vents exploding cells through a thruster nozzle so that when you intentionally trigger thermal runaway it can ignite and nozzle the pressurized gasses out the rear. That way when you're near the end of the race and you've already over drained your pack anyway you can just hit a button and light up the cells and get that hail mary win.

[/quote]

The carvon V3 system is modular. The stator can already be swapped with other 63 series SK3 stators with different KV's if they are the same length. The axle is removable as well so  a longer stator is possible with a longer axle. Still not as veratile as belts as @Chaka pointed out but I have 83, 90, 97 and 107mm wheels and the difference between the gear ratio between 83 and 107 is huge I can adjust my top speed over 10-15mph range in mush less time than a belt drive can.

@guyguy
The 10mile leg was from the begining of the bike path north of thr Santa Monica pier to the end of the bike path south of Venice pier. Speed ranged between 2mph-20mph. Lots of almost stop and go ridong near the piers but no hills. We were all riding together keeping pace with each other so I dont expect riding style played a huge roll in this comparison. As far as me being in my boards sweet spot, I dont think it was at all, my board free revs to 60mph where as @Titoxd10001 board free revs to 34, if anything his board was in a much better position for efficiency in during the relatively low speed riding we were doing.

[quote="Jinra, post:53, topic:36192"]
However throw in a load, stop and go traffic, wind resistance, hills, etc and the gearing potential from a belt drive train easily outweighs any efficiency the hubs had over belts.
[/quote]

But why would a 4wd carvon board with a 280lb rider come anywhere near a 2wd belt board with an 80lb weight advantage on our 10mile ride, with stop and go and a decent range of speeds? 

[quote="guyguy, post:56, topic:36192"]
There are also a lot of other factors too, belt tightness, use of an idler, how each rider handled the throttle
[/quote]

Luis is an experienced and knowledgeable builder and rider, we swapped boards towards the end and his boards is super dialed. I highly doubt he running his belts any tighter than necessary to prevent slipping and his numbers were what Id expect for a belt drive dual motor board with a 180-200lb rider.

If you want a real test, you have to test the same weight and environment. I ride with a Raptor 2 rider every 2 weeks (about the same weight as me 180lbs) and I consistently get better mileage with the exact same battery pack with all our stop & go riding.

Even on my 25R pack with 2Ah less than the Raptor 2, I ended a group ride a couple weeks ago with 71% while he was sitting at 55%.

Agreed, but this was the best and closest comparision Ive seen yet and was surprised it leaned in the hubs favor considering the extra weight and motors with my Carvon setup.

I still think the belt drive will shine on hill climbs but really this test was all about providing evidence for a statement I made in Lukes thread.

under low-med load cruising situations( at motor rpms within the efficincy range for its KV), where heat isnt much of a concern, the hubs should be more efficient

I dont suspect weight is as much a factor as people make it out to be. I noticed my board died insanely fast during the Enertion Raptor 2 event in SF due to repeated 0 to 100% acceleration races and tests.

At high speed a heavy guy is likely going to have a bigger frontal area too and that's everything at speed. Dying to see what efficiency a 6 or 8 wheel street luge could do at 40 or 60mph.  Bet it beats every vehicle out there for efficiency. Like a 1\6th the fronal area.

Lets ride the river trail you mentioned!  If I swap to the  83mm flywheels and you swap back to your taller gearing we would be alot closer in effective gearing and it would make for an a more accurate comparison. Im thinking  the braking advantage would likely shift in direction of my favor in that case.  Im interested to see how much more efficient your geared board would be for climbimg  hills. We'd really meed to have similar weight riders for that and need to make sure similar amounts of voltage sag are occuring.

You probably know more than me, so do shoot me down if I'm spewing nonsense, but could you design the removable PU so that it only covers maybe a little more than half the motor can? I'd imagine that would give you slightly better cooling, and even more importantly, you remove excess rotating mass... I mean theoretically, we shouldn't need that large of a contact patch since hub motors don't have enough torque to induce wheel slip.

Right... So perhaps you should take a single drive and go on a hill climb versus a dual drive. When you reach the top tell me which has used less power.

My thought is all 4wd would be powered and connected to powered vescs, disconnect control signal from front 2wd, so you can't throttle or break, but you still can on rear 2wd, would the front 2wd then charge the battery and/or supplement current draw of rear 2wd

I read somewhere, who knows where, that someone had a high gearing and a low gearing on a dual belt drive and they actually liked it but I don't know where that was.

You can use Nicos app and set the power differential front to rear 0%/100%, no need to set up a manual switch. Since the front vescs will still be ON it would still charge from rolling on the front motors as well. However, since heat loss increases exponentially with increased torque supplied by the rear motors and the conversion of kinetic energy to electrical energy(charging) is less than 100% efficient,1 I think you'd have minimal efficiency gains if any and more likely losses from the increased rolling resistance and weight of the extra motors that are just coasting. I can do some tests with my 4wd and let you know though.

As it stands today, I'm all for belt drives.  Hubs might be the future, but they just aren't there yet.  As consumers we don't see what is going on behind closed doors in the back of someone's shop, so maybe that future is closer than we realize...

The problem with nearly every belt-driven system I see is that they can't physically transmit all of the torque the motor is capable of producing.  The belt is usually the bottleneck.  There just doesn't seem to be a lot engineering that goes on in regards to belt selection or drivetrain design.  But I can't blame you, because I realize the vast majority don't have degrees in mechanical engineering.  I'm not trying to speak from a high horse and act superior with my "mighty" engineering degrees;  that's just what I see across the industry.  I actually spent a lot of time on this problem and have come up with a design that removes the belt torque transfer bottleneck.  My single belt-drive goes 30mph and can power up any hill in Colorado at near full speed

I've heard this argument (mainly from Jason), but I never understood it. Assuming you have a beefy 6374 motor with an unbreakable, non-skipping, 1mm wide belt. Why would that transfer less power than a 15mm belt with the same conditions (unbreakable, non-skipping). Or is skipping the only issue when we're talking about torque transfer?

My understanding is a stretching belt will be heating up and so the stretching and compressing of a rubber band thin belt would lose a lot of energy making the belt heat up rather than turning the motor even if the teeth aren't slipping.  There might be more to it but that's my best guess.

You should check out @Nowind trampa belt system. I have that with the same Leopards you've likely seen him using with his direct drive system. I've never had belt skip with it, and I love to full throttle on take off. I've also had to come to a complete stop when travelling about 60km/h along a road when a car was pulling out in front of me. The tires are what lost traction, not the belt :)

Pretending it's unbreakable and won't skip, you'd still have the issue of stretching, although that's almost non-existant compared to the other two problems that we're not including in this hypothesis :slight_smile:
Imagine it this way, use your pinky to pick up something with **_some_** weight in it, like a carton of milk. Now use 2 fingers and so on. As the surface area increases the strain and effort required by each finger is much less. As is with a thicker belt, as you increase the width, the less strain is put on the teeth of the belt, which means less stretching (only if it were an unbreakable belt *).

*obviously if the belt could break a thinner belt is more likely to snap before the wider one as there are less fibers to spread the stretching/load on to.

[quote="Jinra, post:112, topic:36192, full:true"]
Yea, I just can't imagine why it'd be worse for torque transfer between a 9mm and 15mm belt assuming both belts aren't slipping or breaking. At max stretch it should delivering the same torque in my eyes.
[/quote]

That's probably the problem, that people read these stories about how a belt loses X amount of % performance and so on, but don't understand that a lot of that calculation also accounts for the fact that with thinner belts you just straight up can't apply a certain amount of force upon it as it will snap.

[quote="wafflejock, post:113, topic:36192, full:true"]
Well there's some energy loss for sure in stretching the belt since it heats up I'm just not sure how substantial that is or how much adding 33% more belt width or whatever it is makes a difference in reducing the stretching.
[/quote]

Just remember that yes the law of conservation does mean that heat is lost energy, however don't automatically assume that it's lost through the belt rather than transferred to it. Metal is a great conductor for heat. A wider belt would also allow for more stretching however it requires much more force to do so. A great way you can see this in person is buying some rubber bands and stretching two of the same length, but different width. You will see that the thinner one is easier to stretch and will also snap at a shorter length than that of the wider one.

Insight Educational Tips
With the help of ProTorque, We've put together a list of problems and possible causes to help you identify the reason for timing belt failure. Visually examine your timing belt drives for these top 6 failure-causing problems and it could help to prevent your drives grinding to a halt, avoiding unscheduled downtime.

1. Misalignment

Misalignment is one of the main causes of timing belt drive failure. Excessive or uneven tooth wear, belt tracking and tensile failure can all be attributed to misalignment. By checking and aligning your shafts and timing pulleys you can increase the life of your timing belts and save yourself lots of downtime.

Sign Up To Our INSIGHT email & receive top tips to get more out of your machinery

2. Excessive load
If the timing belt teeth are shearing, excessive load is more than likely the cause. Tensile failure and even excessive tooth wear can also be caused by excessive load or shock loads, although the latter is less likely. To cure this problem you’re going to have to redesign the drive.

3. Under-tensioned Belt
Tooth skipping, also called ‘ratcheting’, is probably down to your belt being under-tensioned. Under-tensioning can also cause excessive or uneven tooth wear and excessive drive noise so use a tension gauge to set the correct tension on those timing belts!

4. Weak drive structure
If your drive is vibrating excessively or your timing belts are suffering from apparent belt stretch, you could have a weak drive structure. Try reinforcing the drive structure and you could stop the problem.

5. Damaged or worn pulleys
Damaged or worn timing pulleys will substantially reduce belt life. Worn teeth will cause belt wear and/or damage. Nicks or gouges can cut the belt. Inspect and replace pulleys that show signs of wear.

6 Debris in the timing pulley or drive
It’s the most overlooked, but debris can cause a multitude of problems for your timing belt & pulley. Dirt on the teeth can abrade the belt and oil can attack the belt materials. Use a stiff brush to clean off rust and dirt. Wipe clean of oil and grease. Debris can account for any of the above reasons for timing belt failure – so go clean those pulleys and fit a shield to that drive! 

A timing belt will eventually fail by loss of teeth in what’s considered normal wear, any other failure reason should be considered abnormal. For a full list of possible failures and the corrective action to take, consult our Timing Belt Troubleshooting Guide to check your belts & timing pulleys.

If you're talking to one who says they stretch, talk to an actual mechanic.

Everything can stretch, it's basic physics. Even timing chains stretch. Best way for you to learn this is go buy a chainsaw and cut into dirt for 10 minutes, then go cut wood for the next hour and see how loose the chain becomes.

It's like the common misconception of **_only highly conductive materials conduct electricity_**, when in fact **_everything can conduct electricity_** just a matter of how much and how efficiently it can do it :)

You are free to think what you want, but they do NOT stretch.  If you stretch a timing belt 1/8in, you have a broke belt. 

If you are saying they stretch in a micro measurement, so does stainless steel  and therefore not applicable to  the discussion .

If you run them to tight they wear the bearings in the motor out. That wouldn't happen if they stretch.  The usability of a timing belt depends on them NOT stretching.  I've build a few 304s and 360s that I def don't want belts stretching on.

To clarify and this is based on my time with cars and esk8 a timing belt can "stretch"(don't chew my head off keep reading), most timing belts are made with fiberglass fibers, which can break giving off the appearance of stretching however this would occur at very high rpms or too much belt tention if this was the case though you wouldnt have much time to realize it before the belt broke. But to answer his question more directly about belts stretching, no they do not nor should they under proper alignment. As for physics not sure what you are referring to but it might be the appearance of stretching at higher Rpms?

Exactly, no one was really even talking about it, they got their knickers in a knot when a hypothetical question was asked that spoke about a belt that would **_never be able to snap_**. I'm sure if people could be bothered and they searched Poisson's Ratio and belts they'd likely find something new to learn about.

From what I gather reading this thread, it appeared to stretch because the fibers inside the belt broke.

From my understanding if the length of the belt increased, it's not because it stretched but the internal fibers broke and the rubbery component relaxes, the belt is broken not worn at this point, it can still function for a limited time in this "stretched" state till it completely rips apart.

I can also confirm that belts do not stretch. I read through the sdp/si pdf a million times and they do mention that belt stretch does not exist. The only reason it may seem like it is because, as many other users have said, the fibers are what provides the stiffness. If the fibers were to break overtime then yes the belt would become flexible as the rubber can stretch out with nothing hanging it together.

@psychotiller is right in that belts don't stretch. You can technically argue that at a microscopic level there's some level of stretch but it's not even worth mentioning. Timing chains on the other hand do stretch and that's why belts are preferred. 

I think FLEX is the word that was meant to be used earlier in the thread when explaining the energy loss due to heat. But even then, the amount of energy loss from a belt drive is negligible.

I feel pretty neutral on the matter was just giving an opinion originally based on knowing with rubberbands they can be heated by stretching over and over and assuming the belt had some stretch to it due to not having continuous fibers through the entire belt, but I'm not familiar with how they're really made (sounds like the are continuous fibers).

Bicycle chains get longer over time. It's often referred to as chain stretch, although the real cause is that the pins/rollers/bushings wear down due to friction. Could be the same with belts; inner surface of the teeth wear down causing them to appear looser/longer. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

So....ummm,  Ill just  throw out a few ideas since I know a little something about timing belts after 10 years as an ASE Certified Master Automotive Technician, working as lead technician and an automotive repair shop and having changed near 100 timing belts and having a degree in Applied Technologies.

Before the automotove timing belt became popular on OHC engines, most used chains to operate the valve train. As the pins and holes in the chain links wear, the chain elongates causing slack and retarded valve timing. This was one of the issues the timing belt helped address. It has little to no "Appreciable" elongation over the life of the belt. 

Modern timing belts are actually made of a whole lot more than rubber. The teeth are reinforced with with polyaramid fabric used for is (strength to flex ratio) but that material is still rather elastic so the backing of the belt has a layer of twisted glass cord. The twisted glass cord structure allows the needed flexibility and provides the belts resistance to stretch. 

That being said, I have seen timing belts stretch!..... but only over the 1st few hundred miles and not enough to change the timing by even 1 degree. Ive changed  timing belts on cars with 200,000 miles on the original belt 😱 and the timing marks were still aligned.

You guys can take that for what its worth lol.

I think what racidon was trying to say was that EVERYTHING "stretches" in that everything has elasticity characteristics (youngs modulus, poisson ratio, etc.). Even rocks stretch. 

So technically speaking timing belts do stretch but for all intents and purposes of this thread, they dont. I just tried pulling on my 9mm belts and couldn't see any deformation at all.

Saying that these belts stretch is just being nitpicky, kinda like a grammar nazi... but a physics nazi.

@racidon and @psychotiller
Belts stretch period. It is physics. 
How much do they stretch? A negligible amount if you ask me. 

You can take the longest belt you have, cut it, clamp it on one end to a vise on a table and start applying tension on the other end. Measure the stretch and tension applied without permanently deforming the belt and you can get the modulus of elasticity. Absolutely everything stretches if you apply the right amount of tension. 

Metals stretch. If you have ever taken a materials class you would know that everything stretches. In a structural mechanics lab, one of the labs you perform is to grab a random piece of metal and figure out the material based on yield strength, tensile strength, density and youngs modulus. These are all measurable quantities. 

Timing belts do stretch. Repeat after me: timing belts do stretch.

Now, lets back out from lab conditions and back into real world. How much tension is being applied to your belts? The preloaded tension you initially put there plus any tension created by the reaction forces from the wheel. Along with that tension and the youngs modulus of the belt, you can determine how much stretch there is in it. Will it be negligible? Maybe. But it's there. 

E: Literally took me a minute of googling. 
I typed "htd5 belt elongation", second link down "timing belt theory"...

[/quote]

You will get a lower efficiency than if you didn't have anything on your front wheels. Reason is you have to take into account motor losses which are about 5-8% for a properly designed system. You also have gearbox losses (if it is a belt system). Finally you have to take into account electrical losses through your esc which again could be as low as 5% but never zero. In the end, you end up with a less efficient system cause your rear drive now also has to provide enough power to overcome the resistance of your front drive.

Thank you Derek! 

Armchair physicists are always so sure of themselves. Even when proven wrong they will say "well, everything stretches a little" Fact is timing belts are perfectly capable of delivering huge amounts of power to the road as long as your mounts do not flex and can keep proper alignment. However belts do resist bending and this resistance does use some energy but not enough to concede the ability to fine tune a gear ratio for a given task, at least for me. I need to know I can switch wheel size and adjust my drive to match.

Something that I never see in these conversations is how all motors have a sweet spot in terms of KV and how much performance can suffer going too far from that sweet spot. Hub motors need to ignore this sweet spot completely while reduction drives can tune the drive system to complement the motors.

We will sit across a table from one another.
I will aim a large rubber band at your face.

You will aim a synchronous timing belt at mine.

We will stretch our weapons back as far as we can and release.

Belts don't "stretch" in any amount that isn't negligible. 

BUT there is a side of tension and a side of no tension when under load. 

There is also the width of the belt. While the width won't determine a different stretch, it will determine how resistant the belt is to bending. The velocity of the belt can cause the belt to push inward/outward from centrifugal and centripetal forces depending on the point in time at axis of rotation(around the pulleys). 

To counter act this inward/outward motion(secondary function) automobiles use idlers, idlers primary function is belt tension, its secondary function is reducing belt slap from changing RPMs.

Wider belts slap less and keep their trajectory around a closed loop with less deviation.

What your feeling as "more torque" from a wider belt, is less deviation of belt trajectory. Y'all might think the belts go from point a to point b in a straight line, but they don't, there is oscillation. 

When you have two belts with the same tensile strength/mm of width, the wider belt with more mass being driven at the same velocity as narrower belt, will have more kinetic energy and hold a more of a true path with less oscillation (belt slap).  
A belt that slaps more travels farther with less energy transfer. A belt that slaps less will waste less energy in oscillation and transfer more power to the second engagement point.

The other piece of wider belts is it allows more surface friction, more friction is harder to make the belt skip.

If my wife asks me to hand her the set of keys touching the magazine on the table, and my reply is, well the keys are not touching the magazine because according to particle physics nothing is actually touching anything, it's all an illusion due to repellant forces at a quantum level, she's going to look at me like I'm crazy. If you say belts do stretch but the context is do they stretch in a way that affects their use in esk8, you're kind of missing the question in context which is that they don't stretch in an appreciable way to this application.

It actually started with a hypothetical, then some kid tried being smart saying belts **_never_** under any circumstance stretch in **_any_** way.   So PXSS did what he should have done, looked up the terms related to it. It was also mentioned in my original comment that the stretch that happens but almost non-existent.

Some kid? Are you retarded? Seriously, You're not right. You can chip away at reality little by little with physics arguments just so in some miniscule way, for some reason that doesn't apply to our builds or the entire automotive industry, you feel right. 
Can you personally pick up a belt and stretch it like a rubber band? No.

This isn't about my hatred for Hubs. I'm fine with hubs. This is about you guys trying to prove a point that you can't. Timing belts don't stretch. 

You think they do so prove it by showing us actual stretching. (Not bending, or crimping, or wearing teeth) Stretching.

Oh! And call me a kid to my face.

Cool! Finally a reply that isn't just rude! I appreciate that. Let me tell you why I think your example and mine are different. 

Yes, I agree that if we were talking in terms of molecular physics. This would be silly. Do you know how much belts stretch for our application **under tension**? I sure don't. That's why in my initial comment I stated this:

[quote="PXSS, post:157, topic:36192"]
Now, lets back out from lab conditions and back into real world. How much tension is being applied to your belts? The preloaded tension you initially put there plus any tension created by the reaction forces from the wheel. Along with that tension and the youngs modulus of the belt, you can determine how much stretch there is in it. Will it be negligible? Maybe. But it's there.
[/quote]

So, we are in agreement that the stretch might be negligible. I never denied that, but if the manufacturer of the belts themselves say that elongation due to tensile forces needs to be taken into account in the design of a drive, I'd be a terrible engineer to simply dismiss that. Would you not agree? 

This is a quote from the design guide for drive systems from gates (manufacturer of htd5 belts that everyone uses). 

[quote]
If the calculated elongation is excessive, it can be improved by making one or more of the following changes:
• Reduce the belt working tension.
• Reduce the span length.
• Increase the belt width.
• Increase the installation tension.
• Choose a belt with a higher stiffness tensile member
[/quote]

---

Now to some math on our application. 
**E: you can skip this next paragraph if you don't like math. The important stuff is on the next one...**

At 36V, a hard acceleration from stand still can draw up to 40A from your battery, correct? That equals to 1440W. Lets say you lose 20% to efficiency, thats 1152W of power. Now we can assume that our rpm is low, lets say 200rpm. This means a torque of 55Nm at the motor shaft and 55Nm in the opposite direction at the wheel pulley. We know the radius of a motor pulley is roughly 5mm and the radius of the wheel pulley is roughly 30mm. That means 11000N of force in the motor side and 1833N of force in the opposite direction at the wheel. Now assuming that one end is fixed, the equivalent would be pulling one end with 12833N. What is the length of the belt were pulling? Center to center distance should be a close approximation. 65mm is close enough I think. So if we were to apply 1283kg hanging from a 65mm long belt, would it stretch? In standard units that would be 2881lbs hanging from the belt. That is without including any shock factor into the equation. 

**E: continue here if you skipped the math**

2881lbs = 19 of me hanging from 65mm long x 12mm wide belt...
Yes, thats an idiotic amount of force on a tiny belt. Will the stretch be at a molecular level? I don't think so. I think the stretch would definitely be measurable with standard tools. Will it be significant enough to affect the operation of the belt? I still somehow think it would be negligible but without me assuming a youngs modulus I cannot give you a quick and dirty estimate. 

E: assuming the same Young's modulus as fiberglass and that the tensile member takes up the whole backing area of the belt...
***Elongation of a 65mm x 12mm width belt under tension from a hard acceleration is... 0.8mm***
That is 1.25% elongation. 
Belts never stretch at all. Yeah right...
If we assume the tensile member only takes 33% of said area, the elongation increases to 1.6mm or 2.5%

**Again, I agree that if we were talking about stretch at a molecular level, this would be silly.**

**All of the threads here somehow always become toxic and more about calling the other guy an idiot.** If you have a valid argument, there is a polite way of expressing it. I will entertain conversations with polite people like you seem to be. If the opposing argument is "nah, you're wrong, why? Because I say so brah. You're stupid" or a slightly wittier variant then I'm not going to even try and debate because obviously we will get nowhere. This is the main reason I stopped posting 6-7months ago. People can't just have a civilized conversation here it seems...

I just went back up and read where this whole argument started. It was a hypothetical scenario where belts dont snap or skip... Way to take things out of context

[quote="racidon, post:115, topic:36192"]
Pretending it's unbreakable and won't skip, you'd still have the issue of stretching, although that's almost non-existant compared to the other two problems that we're not including in this hypothesis :slight_smile:

It really comes down to the material properties of the tensile member, which is why there are some differing opinions here.  Polyester-reinforced belts are more elastic and better at absorbing shock.   Fiberglass-reinforced belts are stronger with less elongation.  I doubt many of us are using kevlar/aramid belts...

If you're not familiar with the term "Modulus", it is the Modulus of Elasticity.  Basically it is a measure of a material's stiffness.  (Actually it is the slope of the stress-strain curve in the elastic region, but I'm not going to get all enginerdy on you).  In simple terms, pull on it this much and it deforms this much.  High modulus = low stretch

* E_polyester = 2 Msi
* E_fiberglass = 10 Msi
