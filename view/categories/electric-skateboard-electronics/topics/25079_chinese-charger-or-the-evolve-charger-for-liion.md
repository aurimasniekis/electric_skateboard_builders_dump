Looking at 2 chargers for a 10s3p samsung 30q pack with bms. Is there a noticeable quality difference between those two chargers?

I don't know which one will last longer. But you'll need one of these.

For sure man. Just realized the deliver times. Trying to get my board done by the end of this month, cause i'm going on vacation. These are the only ones that are not straight from china

I noticed they have 3 pins instead of 2. Is that L shaped pin a mount?
