Hello there, 
I write this as my last chance to get this this going. It's driving me mad. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/5/2580b1114b62296a0212dc734a353403e4256a5f.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I own 2 GT2B one of them is modded, but none of them can bind. 
When I do the binding procedure the reciever stop blink as if it where binded but the remote keeps blinking and I can't find any signal on the BLDC, i use the winning remote for now and it's so dangerous because of all the cut out i don't feel safe on my board ! Please help :)

Follow this video exactly and it should bind easily.

Ahhh did you remember to take the binding key out once it is binded? I forgot about that the first time and i thought something was wrong.

Had this same problem just a couple hours ago. I've modded a Sparkle mod. The transmitter binding light didnt light up but it stayed on permanently even while pressing down the bind button + turn on. You'll need to connect **both** potentiometer cables and then try again. That way it'll go into binding mode.
