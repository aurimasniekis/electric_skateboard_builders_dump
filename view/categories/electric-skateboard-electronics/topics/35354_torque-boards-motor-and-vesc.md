Where do I plug in my motor's sensored servo wire into my vesc? they are both made by torque boards so I assumed they would both for into each other. Am I missing something? none of the male connector prongs on the vesc fit the motor's. Am i going to have to buy a adapter? If so i would really be disappointed

You need a male to male sensor adapter to go from the sensor plug on the VESC to the one coming out of the motor. 

Its listed on the VESC parts on DIY's webpage. Let me find you a link..

Thank you. Im just disappointed they can't just make the motor and the vesc with the same plug. I guess its just to make more money.

Psychotiller and Miami Electric Boards sell them as well. If you want good support, then I suggest buying from the hardworking guys on this site.
