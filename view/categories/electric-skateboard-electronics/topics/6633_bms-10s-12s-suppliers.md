I am looking for 10s or 12s BMS with 60-80a discharge. 

All I am finding is either Bestech  or Suppower

http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html

Or

http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-37v-42v-10s-80a-10x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-389.html


Are there any other suppliers ? Cheaper alternatives ?

I looked around a lot and these 2 are pretty much it. 
Bestech's shipping is fast and more affordable than Supower. 
Bestec has built in on/off switch
More FET's and heat sinks.

oh ok got it. will they do single orders or is there a minium? I am using some standard lipo chargers now but this looks quite appealing and its not too expensive
