So I have these Maytech 6364 motors.

I have this sensor adapter that came with my dual 4.20. How do I make sure the sensor cables are in the correct order? I’ve read someone on the forum killed the sensor by connecting incorrectly so I don’t want to destroy mine :smile:

You could probably just look at the pinout for the vesc sensor port and the maytech data sheet.  That's what I was planning to do when I receive mine

The sensor order is correct if you connect it to a focbox. It is in reversed order for escape because for some reason which baffles me stewii decided to do it in reversed order. 
Maybe he was scared off by Frank?
Maybe he just made a mistake. 
Maybe he just felt like fcuknig with us. 
Maybe he has a deal with maytech so we order new motors in case we mess up. 
Maybe, just maybe he lives in opposite world.

The important bit is getting the positive and negative in the right place.

My adapter cables which are generally used with the FOCBOX are have straight 1-1 wiring. If you want to be sure you can check the FOCBOX wiring, locate the Red (+) and Black (-) wires and make sure they match up with the pinouts for your VESC and you are good to go

Thanks guys. At least now I have a clue and can figure it out from there. You guys have a schematic of the FOCBOX?
