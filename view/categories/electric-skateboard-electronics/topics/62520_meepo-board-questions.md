Hi guys! Do you know if Meepo Boards mount sensored or sensorless hub motors?

And, in general for hub motor boards: if you kick push the board while the motor is running, does the ESC keep on working fine? Or it looses sync with the hub? (in particular if it's sensorless)

Thanks for the attention!

They use sensored motors. Why would you want to kick push while having it on? If the battery is empty, you can kick push as regular board

Fair question :smiley:
Keeping it simple, kick pushing would save up battery energy: so if you kick push the hard initial part of the acceleration you would have much more range! I just want to avoid burning the esc or desyncing hubs-esc!

It wonâ€™t desync, most people kick off first anyway
