hi anyone no the symbol on this remote control circuit board, or an info on the receiver. i am sure i have seen it before.

mcu :  stm8s003
rf chip :nrf24l01

rf data dump
STATUS =0X00 RX_DR=0 TX_DS=0 MAX_RT=0 RX_P_NO=0 TX_FULL=0
RX_ADDR_P0-1 =0XE7E7E7E7E7 0XC2C2C2C2C2
RX_ADDR_P2-5 =0X00 0X3F 0XC5 0XC5
TX_ADDR =0XC5C5C5C5C5	
EN_AA		 = 0xff
EN_RXADDR        = 0XFF
RF_CH		 = 0xff
RF_SETUP

NRF24L01
CRC LENGTH   = DISABLED
PA POWER   = PA_MIN	

i am going to have a mess with the stm tomorrow and see what data i can pull off it.

No, ive seen this on alibaba. Seems like a bench wheel type of remote, or at least an older model.  No clue on reliability.  It's definitely something you would get with a china pre-built
