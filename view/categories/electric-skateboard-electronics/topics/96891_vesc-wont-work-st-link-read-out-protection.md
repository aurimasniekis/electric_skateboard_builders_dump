PLEASE HELP
I have had my board finished for about a week now and two days ago one of my two vescs bricked. I had the sensor wires plugged into the program/debug port (figured that out afterward). The blue light (and only the blue light) still comes on but I cannot connect to ESC tool on my computer.
I am at a loss atm. 
   - I cannot connect to computer
   - I have an ST-Link but I get an error that describes needing to "disable read out protection"

Can someone please help?! I really dont want to drop another $100 on another VESC
