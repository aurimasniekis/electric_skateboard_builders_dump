```
It has struck me that there is  an opening for a VESC/e-skate controller magician to offer their services to connect remotely to vescs around the world?
Is this possible? With the use of FaceTime/skype people could pay to have someone trouble shoot or configure their setup?
It might not be to every ones taste but maybe there could be a market for this?
I get the fact that this is against the diy ethos but a little hand holding didn't hurt anyone did it?
