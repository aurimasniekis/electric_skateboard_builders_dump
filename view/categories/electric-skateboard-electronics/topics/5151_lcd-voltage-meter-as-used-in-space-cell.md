Can anyone show me where I can get the LCD voltage display that is used in space cells? It doesn't have to be the same one but just needs to be similar in function showing percentage, voltage, etc. and nothing too fancy

Thanks,

I just borked my Space Cell LCD with water today and I would like a replacement soon.

I found these on Amazon and they are Prime listed. The problem I found is they are a fixed voltage as there is no button to change the voltage readings. Which is the one I need? Does it go by nominal voltage?

36V or why not below, form factor does not work jamming into Spacecell?
