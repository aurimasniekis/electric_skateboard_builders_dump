I´m back in the esk8 game and want to get rid of my Winning W1 remote because altough i like the formfactor, i´ve had 2-3 connection issues in the past forced my board to break suddenly, which is very dangerous.

Now i found the W2 on Ali and i might give that thing a chance.

What are your experiences? Any issues so far?

I already noticed that there is only one ["Winning"](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-arrival-2-4Ghz-mini-remote-controller-with-receiver-for-electric-skateboard-longboard/32729752651.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.17.69fd3c6ddmvNfj&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_9_10065_10068_10547_319_317_10548_10696_10084_453_10083_454_10618_10304_10307_10820_10821_537_10302_536_10902_10843_10059_10884_10887_321_322_10103,searchweb201603_6,ppcSwitch_0&algo_expid=1a15f3b6-bbc6-4621-bb80-dcaa3c75a185-2&algo_pvid=1a15f3b6-bbc6-4621-bb80-dcaa3c75a185&transAbTest=ae803_4) (probably the one i already use) and the v2 with a slight other case and the speedswitch, which seems to have binding/ppm issues according to this [review](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/nano-v2-full-review/25159)?!

Haha :smile: I´m no big deal here. [This](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-first-build-o-h-fd98-10s-lipo-2x-5s-5000-mah-190-kv-2200-watts-vesc/5924) is my board.

Nice little build. I’m surprised you get 20-25km out of 5ah. 

I suppose 20kph average really helps with that. 

Gotten used to riding faster now by any chance?

Most china production boards can even go 40kph nowadays.

I only weight about 68 kg and i mostly ride on flat bicycle lanes without many starts and stops.

The boards topspeed is 39 kph (190kv/42v/36-14 gearing/80mm kegels) and i already rode at these high speeds and enjoyed it pretty much but because of the unreliable winning-remote i sticked to 20-25 kph most of the time for now.
