Hey guys, I would love to get some help on this.
-10S3P LG HG2
-2x [VESC](products/torque-esc-bldc-electronic-speed-controller?variant=722351915031)
-2x [MOTOR](collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv)
-Bestech BMS

I recently finished building my board and road it around fine, then it started shutting completely off(VESC LED off). Just running it would shut the VESC off so I dont know if the fault log(NO FAULT) would even be accurate because it doesnt remain on when problem is triggered. I measured my battery 34.5V and it is above my cutoff. 

Would love any input and help. Thank you

```
maybe your bms shut off the voltage.
Can you measure if when you switch on there is a output voltage after the bms?
If no than probably the e-switch or something in the bms is broken.
