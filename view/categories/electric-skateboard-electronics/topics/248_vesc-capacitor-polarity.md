The VESC came with a capacitor but it doesn't indicate if it is polarity concious? I assume it is but how do I know which is positive and which is negative?
Would really appreciate some advice. Thanks

The side of the capacitor with the white stripe on it is the negative side.

@lowGuido's right, of course! You can watch Vedder solder the VESC in this video, at around 2:20 he installs the capacitor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fyj5TxxoU8
