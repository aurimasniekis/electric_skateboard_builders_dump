I recently purchased a VESC and a quantum 2.4ghz 3ch receiver. But the receiver didn't come with a cable to connect to the ESC. What type of connector do I need to buy? I would prefer to make it myself as I need it in the next week or so. It's for a school project.

You need a servo lead extension like this one: http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__9697__15cm_Servo_Lead_Extention_JR_26AWG_10pcs_bag_.html

Honestly, you should buy right now another RX/TX so when you will get problems with the Quanum you can switch to the spare one. The GT2B / GT2E is the most reliable RX/TX!
