Hi all

Could somebody please identify what size JST connection is pictured here. I ordered a micro and that was too small. I am assuming it's the next size up but don't know what that's called.

Give us a scale - a ruler next to it, preferably in millimeters.

For future reference, the main identifying feature of those connectors is the pin pitch - the spacing between them. The external dimensions are much less critical. Common sizes are 2.5mm, 2.0mm, 1.5mm, 1.25mm, and 1.0mm.
