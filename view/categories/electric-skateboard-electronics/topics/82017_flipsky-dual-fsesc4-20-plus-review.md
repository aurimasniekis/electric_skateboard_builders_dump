I have various kinds of Flipsky esc.
This esc is an upgrade of the Dual FSESC4.20 

This ESC has smart anti-spark switch.
**Smart anti-spark switch :** 
 - If the motor does not move for 10 minutes, the power automatically turns off.
 - If you try to turn it on again, it will turn on automatically when you move the wheels.

My Dual FSESC4.20 has problem cutting off torque  during low speed up hill Sometimes.
I first checked this problem. 
As a result, i have confirmed that this issue has been resolved in the Dual FSESC4.20 Plus.

**1. Form factor**

Do you have any data logs?
What was the max battery current drawn?
How was the temperature of the pcb during longer rides?

Edit:
What’s the left one? Two single Flipsky 6?

So I guess the problems with cutouts beyond 10s and 30A motor amps has been resolved?

me too, I have the older 4.20 dual and was quite impressed how easy it was to setup but I planned on using with 12s (with starting with conservative battery amps lol) 

if the cutouts are gone, I'll grab another one in a second ! :)

@Andy87
Do you have any data logs?
=> I'm not have any data logs yet. 
    I have not yet prepared a mobile app.

What was the max battery current drawn?
=> Please refer to below picture.

How was the temperature of the pcb during longer rides?
=> I have not been able to ride a distance longer than 2 km.
I will update later.

What’s the left one? Two single Flipsky 6?
=> Yes, Single Flipsky6.

There have been issues with the e-switch and voltage readings with other versions from Flipsky.
Would be great if you could let us know how the anti spark switch performs and if the voltage readings are accurate.

@chrischo1996
I already put the ESC in the case. I will try to change the setting later. It is going to be used as 10S now.
"TM9" logo is ESC case.

Can I compare the battery checker voltage to the setting program voltage?

If your battery checker gets the data from the battery direct and not from the esc, I think that should be fine.

@Martin do you know/see a way to wire in a battery indicator after the built in anti spark so the indicator will turn on and off with the esc?

@M.Hboards
I do not use voltage gauge because I use wattmeter. Sorry.

@Martin just by looking at the unit do you see a way to wire one in after the built in anti spark? are there any pins that may be a voltage reader?
