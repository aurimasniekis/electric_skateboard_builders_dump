...well, just connect it with Focbox :stuck_out_tongue:

Focbox has female port, this one is male type, so...

![maytrech-remote|634x500](upload://8w275KX8nQzuplkfRn62LBzGlU4.jpg)

since its possible to hook up any 10S battery (without having to use a maytech vesc as stated in the manual) to the receivers GND and 42V pins to have the remote indicate battery status, its advised by maytech to connect a 10K resistor to the positive side between the battery and receiver.

It seems to have an adapter or something attached maybe.  It has three pins not three holes. Can’t get what seems an adapter off though

Be careful with that remote, it made me fly on my ass today during hard acceleration due to disconnecting issues... 

PPM is the port with 3 pins.
The old focbox didnt have a ppm Cable attached like the new ones do.

So I need an adapter or cable or something I guess. ?

Or maybe could just solder it?  
Hard to find adapter locally I think.

Got an adapter I can pick up thanks. 
Yea motors are electrically simple.  It’s more so mechanical design. I don’t know much about electronics or even plugs.
