They're on their way to me now. Enough to cover my backorders and a few extra. I'm going to re-up immediately when they get here. 

The streets will flow with the focboxes of the people. 

Also my motors mounts are back in stock with some slight modifications. I'm updating the site now.

Given that his order is 16xxx, we should have been covered...

I just contacted support and they said it would be shipped by next Friday. Just like the previous 10 or so weeks.  #155xx

Sorry to derail your thread lhb

i'm pretty sure they mentioned that vendors were being prioritized at some point, so it doesn't surprise me that a 16xxx shipped before a 15xxx. The probably just got the shit they needed to shove them out and now they're figuring out how to serve the most people at once, which would logically result in getting them to the distributors first making it more likely that consumers begin receiving them at approximately the same time.

I AM the us agent, and I have not received stock. 

There seems to be some temporal distortion on their part. Perhaps living 17 hours in the future is causing some kind of issue in perception. I only got the shipment notification 8 hours ago. DHL is fast, but that's Amazon fast. For example, I ordered a 16port unmanaged switch yesterday mornign and got it yesterday evening.

I can imagine this going down in the warehouse:
Peasant: Sir we have 500 orders ready to ship!
Boss: We just got a vendor order, ship them all to him. 
Peasant: But sir, they have been waiting 3 months... and we still have another 500 orders still waiting.

i don’t foresee a very long or fruitful future for them with these kind of blatant lies and delays.  they’re just making it harder and harder for themselves to expand and grow. if they somehow end up expanding through some sort of miracle they will crash and burn if they ever try to pull this type of shit as a large, mainstream business

[/quote]

no. I'm not servicing cyber monday orders that were made directly from enertion. 

That would be like if somebody stole money directly out of my wallet by making me pay a certain price for some gadget then selling them to my customers directly at a cut rate and then asking me to help fulfill all their orders. 

well.. i say it would be LIKE that.. but it literally would be that, because that's literally what happened. 

undercutting us could also be part of the reason the certified resellers could be getting the parts earlier than the direct customers. Since.. you know.. they burned us at a really bad time to get burned.

Yes. My price was, and is, far higher then the fire sale price. Everyone's is. Nobody is paying below $120 for these things, and a lot of us are having to value-add because people are still buying direct from Australia at a higher price which makes almost no sense at all. 

i mean come on. $165 US plus shipping from australia and your stuck with anemic phase lead conectors after you wait two weeks for it to get to the US from Oz. 

For $165 i'm giving you a 5.5mm bullet upgrade and it gets to you in three days ubn the US  (if i have them in stock  ffs) and $155 otherwise. I mean... why? lol

Ehy man, did you order before February? I can't understand how they are organized since I thought the Chinese New year will delay everything, maybe is your batch coming directly from Enertion, Australia? Since I know they normally come from the chinese factory, and they are closed now....I'm pretty confused 🤔

Im actually the US Agent guys. Damon got his Focboxes because he had no Nano-x in his order. No conspiracies going on here.  


I just got a nano-x order right now of about 30 and there are going to be over a hundred or so in the next shipment. So I am handling the US distribution while production is on CNY.  Long story short, orders

Ill update as soon as I know when they will be in, or if they just show up at my door step. 

Rest assured, I ship quick. Always at MOST next day if its all in stock.

Thanks for your expert analysis... Let me tell you some actual facts.

1. We manufactured so many FOCBOXs in 2017 the entire global inventory of MOSFETs where depleted and they still haven't recovered. 
2. We are supplying University's all over the globe.
3. Uber is using the FocBox in their secret black ops projects.
4. We sold more FOCBOX in 3 days than we would normally sell in 3 months. 
5. We are now frequently ordering FOCBOXs in quantities of 1000's - $100k+ orders that we must pay upfront every few months.
6. Before cyber Monday sale our customers enjoyed a period of around 4-5 months of being in-stock and shipping orders same day. (Suprsing how nobody talks about that achievement, it took 2 years & at least 5 different factories to make that a reality)
7. We have established a global network, spanning 7 countries, of the best esk8 builders and esk8 entreprenuers primarily so that customers can get better products, faster shipments and also get amazing service. We actually make less profit doing this but we know the industry will be better because of it.
8. We have had year on year growth in sales and survived in a an industry where many have fallen over.
9. We are now going head to head with the biggest brand names in the game and our Skateboard is untouchable in terms of performance and features.
10. We employ staff in 4 different countries.
11. We have built the biggest community for sharing free knowledge.


Have we worked out how to always predict and supply product according to global demands? No we haven't. That's because global demand is not static, it is growing rapidly and forecasting against that is extremely difficult. When we can afford to order substantially more FOCBOX than what is needed to statisfy global demand we will have ample stock.

@GrecoMan - We have only just started... now Sit back, shut up and watch us become #1 Electric Skateboard brand in the world, probably by 2019.

Peace.

Actually, the charger is in stock, the fullfillment issues we are facing are predominantly due to the people who are/were responsible for warehousing and distribution. 

Basically they are shit, we fired them, blah blah...  Domino effect, our stock got locked down, legal action over ownership... no orders got shipped.. fucking mess.

Anyway, the reason your not getting any help with your order is because you are using the esk8 builders forum to ask about your enertion order. 

Go to the Enertionboards.com website, use the 24/7 chat feature.

Ok, sorry for this mess... Let me answer your question then.

No, we can't ship you just FocBox. You need to wait until china is back from holiday and we will ship your order.

Hypothetically, If we split the order, which we really don't like doing for multiple logistic and management reasons, there will be a separate freight charge. This also won't get your order to you any quicker.

Finally, We can refund the order and you can place another order without the charger. But once again it's not going to speed things up.

Hope this helps.

Im sorry, Can't send you FocBox.

We finally got our hands on our stock, literally the day before China freight forwarding companies closed for February. We sent it out to fullfill orders that were just FocBox.

We simply couldn't get orders with multiple items packed, we tried it was impossible.

The reasons it was impossible.
1. Stock in different locations.
2. No personal to pack it.
3. China new year.


I can assure you we tried every trick in the book, but we failed.

I have a few things to add here:

1. @onloop I'm sure you know this already, but chin up, you're representing a company, you'll always get bashed for mistakes whether they're yours or not. Be truthful and communicate well at all times, however, and you'll be supported.
2. Everyone else, don't forget a _lot_ of people ordered during the Cyber Monday sale. Being a regular on a forum (even a very helpful one) should not get you special treatment. If Enertion helps one person modify their order, they have to do it for everyone and I'm pretty confident in saying it can and would create a logistics nightmare.
3. Regardless of whether you believe Enertion made mistakes, the mistakes have been made and there's nothing they can do about it at this point. Being a dick doesn't help anyone.

Let me explain it in more simple terms..

1. You leave your car at a mates house and go out for some beers for his bucks show.
2. You accidentally leave your keys and phone at the pub.
3. You get a lift home with some hot chick who lives on an isolated property 300miles from the nearest phone.
4. Your mate remembers he left the wedding ring in the car but he has already gone to the wedding. 
5. The pub that has your phone and keys gets shut down for 3 weeks because of a unknown legal issue.
6. You shit the girls bed and she kicks your arse out and you start walking home.
7. Your mates wife is pissed and demands that the wedding ring is delivered or she's going call the wedding off.

This is basically the situation.

The point is it's not as simple as you might think...

To service the entire globe with a range of products is extremely complicated. 

We are the retailer, the manufacturer and the distributor. We also have staff globally and we don't all speak English & our product is not simply on a shelf, I can't touch the product or rearrange items, in many cases the products can be in multiple locations for any number of reasons.

Because of the complexity, getting simple things done correctly is very challenging at times. 

Therefore if you do try to operate outside of the normal set of procedures it mostly causes more problems. Modifying orders and trying to execute special instructions is painful and best if avoided as it tends to disrupt everything.

One thing we have learnt recently is don't trust a third party to handle warehousing and order fullfillment. They will use your stock against you as a ransom.

In 2018 we will be doing all the logistics management in-house. (We will still be using 3pl but the management of supply chain around them will be done in-house)

A little bit of arrogance is necessary, it got me where I am today, so I'm happy to acknowledge that criticism. Petty? Don't really agree with that but don't really give a fuck if that's how this looks. 

My goal isn't to be the nicest CEO in the business, my goal is to make the highest performance esk8 gear available at affordable prices.

I'm simply here talking to my customers like I would talk to anyone, I'm not going to butter folks up and kiss their arse. 

The reality is due to recent unexpected series of events, many people are very disapointing, I'm pissed off too. Probably lost $100k or more as a result of the situation. 

All I know is crying won't help....


P.s. in other news, Anyone who ordered more FOCBOX then they actually needed is directly to blame for the shortage... Lol... (Note: this is a joke don't get upset)

P.s.s thanks for offering the spare FocBox, it's very generous and it's why I created this community in the first place. So we can all be nice and share with each other.

I have no clue why on a $600+ order why eating some separate shipping seems to be the end of the world for a enertion? 

It's literally like a $20 argument here. A small hotdog stand could suffer a $20 loss. Especially from someone who is probably going to buy more things from the store anyway(or was before all this...).

EDIT: I understand all of the previous delays and with the legal action and all that, shit happens in business. BUT, this is something completely separate from all that...It's about not wanting to refund an unshipped charger.

I did it a few times. Its really annoying and unnecessarily complicated to partially ship or partially fulfill just a handful of orders, never mind dozens or hundreds. I wouldn't do it either at that scale, and i'm certainly not known for terrible customer service.

My issue is not the waiting and unwillingness to split the orders, its the attitude.  I own a business too, and I would never communicate with my customers in such a way.  It seems like the only reason he gets on here aymore is to like defend his honor or something.  I think overall he is probably a decent guy, but taking a little more humility would go a long way with customers with legitimate grievences.

I do understamd that it must be frustrating to sit there and take a bunch of critocism from people, but thats kind of part of the gig.  I know, I have had to deal with crap too. Its frustrating, but it is just frustrating as hell seeing people with the slightest amount of percieved power engage with people like that.  Its demeaning.

Jason. We don't need you to be a "nice" CEO, but would really just prefer that you don't constantly come off as an asshole in your defensive responses.

Yes Errors, errors, errors.....so, you never make mistakes?

You should also create another brand and make your fuckboxes and try to supply the entire esk8 market

So @onloop, I'll no longer register complaint. In fact, i can be the last you send out. It's still the dead of winter over here and those controllers and remote are for a build not even realized yet. There's people who need them more. And strippers that need to get paid. @longhairedboy you're the patron saint of large breasted women with a talent for dancing.  @onloop, thanks for selling them at such a reasonable price.

The thing I like about this community is like minded people who enjoy the same hobby. Many of us and willing to lend a helping hand when we can. Let's calm down.

This thread like many before it has turned into somewhat of a bar fight, can we just stop with this banter back and forth already? Enertion over promised and under delivered but largely due to something Jason has little control over, but the deal was too good for us to not purchase. His responses are often extremely defensive which I think most of us dislike. 

As for the issue Max had with the stupid charger that delayed his FocBox shipment. Personally I think the correct apologetic action from Jason should've been done through PM by offering the cancellation of charger and immediate dispatch of FocBoxes. By doing this privately he would not have to do the same for everyone else who might see it as unfair.

Very professional attitude from @onloop in this thread. Definitely got what it's takes to be "#1 in the eskate industry!" Fella needs to take a business 101 or even common curtisy class and learn how to treat his costomer base.

 Makes me not want to support him. Good product+shitty business and support never works. . Maybe he'll do alright, but he'll never be #1. Mate, just say you're sorry for Christ sake.

Pros and Cons of dealing with mom&pop and corporate:

Mom&pop 
build relationships with their customers
higher price than corporate
smaller scale so things take a little longer
problems can be resolved quicker than corporate
(etc etc, insert more here)

Corporations
care about the bottom dollar
rarely care about their customers, but care about PR
cheaper price, because of both selling in larger quantities and production costs (various reasons on this one but won't go into it)
problems can take forever to get resolved
lots of outsourcing
(etc,etc insert more here)

Just a general list. Gotta deal with the caveats whenever buying from the other. Sucks I know, but that's how it is because there is no such thing as a perfect business.

Most of my esk8 purchases have been from smaller shops or one-man efforts because I like to support their progress and obvious passion for this hobby even if it costs me more in the end. But that's how I roll.

Lol Enterion , or rather Jason,doesn’t care about PR in the slightest. He relies on his products to do the talking and arguably , with how much they work, he has the right. Now yes delivery has really out a hit out on Enterion ,but the dude already said what was up and why it happened. He knew he messed up. But he ain’t Ganna be out here kissing people toes just because they whine. It’s either you get a refund and get another product or shut up and wait basically for Enterion. 


Honestly, I rather have a CEO keep It 100 with me rather than bullshit me. But that’s just where I come from. Buttering me up for what? For a promise that ain’t happen ending or a no that’s eventually coming? Nha son. The situation is how the situation is, and no amount of whining , bitching, or “gasp I can’t beleive he did that”, is going to change that. Everyone has options , not options that many would like but options nonetheless. But we should all know , from day motherfucking one, that Enterion is not your buddy, and they are not your friend. If they don’t give a fuck , then they’re going to say they don’t give a fuck , and if you don’t like that, it’s up to you on what you’re going to do 🤷🏽‍♂️

To say any business doesn't care about PR is a joke.

At the end of the day, everyone works hard for their money and that should be respected, but not everyone will do so. Gotta pick and choose whom or who to give money to, and deal with bullshit when it happens cause it CAN happen with anyone.

Anyway, it's just a general list, to be taken with a grain of salt. It doesn't apply to everyone. For example, there have already been multiple people on these forums who have screwed people over without an ounce of remorse. They've already been black-balled by the community, but that doesn't mean they won't stop trying to do business elsewhere. Sucks, but that's reality.

Definition of Public Relations :

The art or science of establishing and promoting a favorable relationship with the public.
The methods and activities employed to establish and promote a favorable relationship with the public.
The degree of success obtained in achieving a favorable relationship with the public.
Communication by a person or an organization with the purpose of creating a favorable public image; commonly referred to as PR.
A promotion intended to create goodwill for a person or institution


So, standing by his products and making a good product is a form of PR.
That and having those Raptor 2 events can also be considered a form of PR.
However, CS is also a form of PR.

Every business approaches and handles PR differently though. Whichever works best for their business model.

its even easier than that. it literally takes 5 minutes to do all three. 

* remove heat shrink from 3mm bullet with razor
* flux the outside of the 3mm bullet
* flux the inside of the wire end of the 5.5mm bullet
* tin the inside of the 5.5mm bullet with enough solder to coat but not fill or run out the hole on the side
* put the iron tip through the hole on the side to keep the bullet warm
* slip the 3mm bullet into the 5mm bullet while the iron is still in there keeping it warm
* remove the iron and push the 3mmm bullet all the way in
* heat shrink the new connector with 7mm shrink tube.

works a treat. 5 minutes or less with a little practice, which is why i only charge $10 for the upgrade. The bullets nearly cost that much if you only buy three.

also it helps a great deal if you have one of those dr octopus looking helping hands things from Amazon.

In poo poo their warranty restictions due to their connectors being replaced. two of the bullet connector pulled right off when I was detaching my motor. Took a look at it and they were cold solder joints.

Untrue, those bullets on the original vesc were uninsulated yes but they were hard mounted to the pcb and could not move so they had no opurtunity to short. And they were insulated by the vescs heat shrink.

There was never bullet with the VESC, enertion always gave the bullet connectors with the motors not with VESC, bullet connectors only appeared with the FOCBOX iteration. I know it for sure I bought a VESC in almost everybatch of this company for the last two years. Once again, with all the respect I have for you, this is true BS. 
Just admit that it was a easy way for enertion to bypass at least 50 - 60 % of their focbox orders because pples would remove the 3 mm bullet. 
       

Ohhhhhh It’s such a nice chance that enertion choosed the only bullet size no one ever used in the community, then tells us if you remove it no warranty. For me this is outragous techniques, i’ve spend in the thousands in enertion products and right now I’m just waiting for a competitor to come up and never give a penny again to Jason. Understant like stated many time in this thread is it insupportable to be considered like shit ( don’t tell me the bullet technique isn’t telling us «  oh dumbass you can’t use conviniently your product without breaking warranty, live with it » ) 

And this is a drop in the OCEAN of BULLSHIT Jason systematically told us, from a « stock » that actualy never existed to the funniest bullshit ever : delays because of a moneyclip.  And by Ocean of bullshit I don’t even mean the struggle enertion had for years to fullfill promises and d
Deliver on time, i’m just talking about the past year.

@onloop If you wanna write up and destroy what I say and tell everyone it’s complete bullshit come down please. 
And all that I say don’t come from nowhere, i just quickly calculated and i’ve spent over 3 000 € in your store during the past 2 years so maybe my word as a customer completely upset and disgusted by your ways of doing buisness can count enough for you ?

I actually didn't mind the 3.5mm connectors due to the Carvon's coming with 3.5mm so it saved me a few steps, sucks that they did a piss poor job of soldering them. I voided the warranty because I soldered them back on because the alternative would be shipping and waiting for them to do it for me?!

So far, we’ve been honoring repairs and warranties for people ruining their Focboxes when replacing their bullets. Even though we reserve the right not to 
We have to have these protections, no product for sale today allows you to modify it without voiding warranty. Like I said, we honor it unles it’s clearly the customers fault. 

And there is a reason we use the 3mm bullet, it’s all about space on our main product the Raptor2. Also the 3mm bullet can handle more than what the Focbox can output. 

And I apologize I may be mistaken about the vesc bullet, I’ve been working on Raptors for years now and they all have the bullet hard mounted. I’m not sure what bullets came on the vesc to memory.

I don't think the XT60 is a downgrade. IT encourages you not to shove more than 60 amps through the thing, which it can probably handle just fine, but not doing it will make it last a hell of a lot longer. VESC-X also had an  XT60, so it wasn't any kind of -grade. up, nor down. 

FocBox also comes with a PWM lead attached, which helps board assembly go a lot quicker. 

Minor components upgrades make it more robust. Ask @blasto and @JohnnyMeduse what they are specifically, but i know they did something to them to make them last longer. Because they do. Which is kind of amazing, because VESC-X is still kicking in all of my original builds when any other ESC besides and AXLE or Ollin would have melted by now. 

The 3.5mm bullets are a trivial upgrade to 5.5 and take less time than soldering on a PWM lead then filling the JST with hot glue to keep the pins from bending in on themselves and shorting the signal.  Its a lateral move. 

The 14 awq phase leads are kind of limp but they do the job. Using them at 12S doesn't even get them warm, as i suspected.

The thing is Enertion seem to have been fed a line by people who were in charge of logistics - production/delivery, I suspect although 'fired' more accurately would be no  no longer  used by Enertion, I remember a skinny French PM in some vid

So Enertion has been fed a line of shit by people like this for months and they have simply had to pass the spoon

It's safe to say this kind of thing happens until you are in the position of having trusted employees on the ground.

I mean Apple/Nike etc have their shit made by third parties but they have eyes on the ground and contingency plans to move production at the blink...but then they are big companies, this is China baby

either way you'll end up replacing a set of connectors, either on the motors or on the focboxes. 

least expensive option would likely be to buy a set of 3.5mm bullets for the motor and replace those.

I have two options on them, 3.5mm bullets and 5.5mm bullets. Add four to your cart, start the checkout process, and see what it comes out to with shipping. You can do that without actually making the purchase to see how much it will be.

I'm thinking of either ordering FOCBOX's or an HW6 ESCape.  I going to be running a 4WD with hummies hubs.  Since I will never go near the erpm limit of 60k, and won't need ones that can handle more, should I just go with the FOCBOX?  Or is there other features the ESCape has that are more than being able to go higher erpm?  Can you run more amps and power through them? 
I also plan on making a 2WD build with a gear drive and that I think could go over 60k erpm.
So should I get all FOCBOX's, all ESCape's, or mix it up with some..?

Escape higher erpm limit as well as higher amp limit.  

[quote="uigiroux, post:293, topic:46485"]
and power
[/quote]

Like amps you mean?

If the price is similar then get a escape.  Focbox is a smaller package and a great vesc.  On your 4wd build it's very unlikely the 4 focbox will be the limiting factor. Same as your dual motor build.  Batteries will limit your board unless you're running plenty of high discharge lipo.

I think you should pick either cause both are fine.

Well the batteries I'm going to be using I haven't decided on yet, but I'm probably going with a 12s4p, maybe even a 5p or 6p, using Sanyo NCR20700C, or the Samsung 30T, or 40T.  All of those have at least 30A, some are 35A.  mAh is at least 3000 or more on them all too.  So would the FOCBOX's be able handle that much power say in a 12s6p pack? Since that's the highest I may go I figure I should have everything that is spec'd for that..

Just because you have enough cells stacked to reach a theoretical 180 amps doesn't mean you'll ever see it. The DieBieMS is rated for 100amps, IIRC. Split four ways that's about 25amps per unit, but its not going to evenly distribute that perfectly. But even if you had a 180 amp version made, you'd probably still never see that kind of current draw at 12S. Per wheel you might see spikes coming close to maybe half of that but the vast majority of the time the ESCs are going to split the load and drastically reduce the amount of power each one actually needs to draw, while ironically enough, drawing slightly more on average overall than a RWD. In my opinion, anyway.

@uigiroux I am sorry to tell but your understanding of currents on boards is bit off... I am running 2WD 10kW setup never saw anything even close to 5kW coming out of battery... I am running 20kg board (100kg with me) even the steepest hills never even went over 60A on single esc... There are no currents like that on boards if you ride normal roads and etc, I can't imagine where you could even reach 100A per motor... Like pulling truck or something?

BTW my setups are all 60 amps, and the DieBiMS setups will be fused at 70 once i get more of them made and start using them in my builds.

Hey, sorry for derailing the thread even more. 

What do you think the greatest benefit is of the DieBie that you’re gonna include it as part of your future builds?

I would even recommend first start with simple 2wd setup... After several hundreds of kilometers than your legs will be able to handle torque then you can start think about 4wd and high current setups, I am still strugling with starting even with throttle mapping and full weight on front leg.

Is there anyway for the output power to be more evenly distributed?  The power out tab on the spark switch is just one wire isn't it?  So from that one wire, if I split that into two (one for the front drives, and the other for the rear) and instead of splitting each of those  additional wires again for each VESC I could have both negative wires from the VESC's connected and set in an xt90 and the positives connected and connected to the other terminal in the xt90, that way there's much less  places in the wiring where things could get made uneven..?

Well like the 40T at 6p I’d be running with 210A just at its normal specs.  If it was too go up a steep hill wouldn’t that shoot that way up?

@uigiroux I am sorry to tell but your understanding of currents on boards is bit off… I am running 2WD 10kW setup never saw anything even close to 5kW coming out of battery… I am running 20kg board (100kg with me) even the steepest hills never even went over 60A on single esc… There are no currents like that on boards if you ride normal roads and etc, I can’t imagine where you could even reach 100A per motor… Like pulling truck or something?

Are these real data or just calculated?

No worries, I'd prefer being told when I'm wrong, lol   otherwise I'd keep making the same mistakes :smile:

calculated...

you can start with the ground speed and wheel diameter to get the wheel rpm,

next use the wheel rpm times the gear reduction (wheel teeth / motor teeth = gear reduction) to get the motor rpm.

next use motor rpm / motor kv to get the back emf v,

then use ((pack v * duty %) - bemf v) / winding resistance = motor current

then 60 / (2 * pi * kv) for motor torque in newton meters per motor amp

then motor current times the torque per motor amp for motor torque

multiply the motor torque times the gear reduction for wheel torque

vehicle thrust comes from relationship between the wheel torque and wheel diameter-- (wheel torque in newton meters  * 1000mm) / ((1/2) * wheel diameter in mm) = vehicle thrust in newtons per motor

then you can get the mechanical watts from motor torque in newton meters times motor angular velocity in rad/sec

electical wattage is (pack v * duty %) * motor current = electrical watts

battery current is electrical watts divided by pack voltage

you can calculate the ohmic heating from motor current *  motor current * winding resistance = wattage copper loss & ohmic motor heating 

wind drag force in newtons is (1÷2) * 1.225 kg/m^3 fluid density of air * estimated frontal area in m^2 * (velocity in meters per second * velocity in meters per second) * estimated drag coefficient = wind drag force in newtons

wind drag power/wattage is wind drag force in newtons * meters per second = wind drag power/wattage

ignored is iron loss, esc loss, battery loss, drivetrain loss, and rolling resistance.

I can tell you one thing is calculated and another then u apply 100A to motor on 8" pneumatic wheels and 20kg board lifts up like its nothing... I am running modified VESC firmware which limits current for low speed as throttle mapping didn't helped. I am getting kicked off the deck all the time without it.

P.S. I am not using bindings so thats why mostly :D (I mean wheels can lift me ±100kg total without even starting to move)
