This is the problem, every time I turn it on and want to ride and want to go forward the motors just stop working and I need to turn the skateboard off and then on to try it again but the same thing happends over and over again , the other pictures are the spare parts I have. Does someone know how I can fix this?

Would guess something gone wrong with the esc, maybe some components on there overheating.  You'd need to do some further debugging to see if the transmitter and receiver are maintaining a connection, but based on behavior you're describing I'd guess something overheating and shutting off.
