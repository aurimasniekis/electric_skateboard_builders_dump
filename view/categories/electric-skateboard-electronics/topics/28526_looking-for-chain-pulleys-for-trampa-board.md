Does anyone have any recommendations for wheel and motor pulleys for chain drive on the Trampa Superstar hub? I already have the mounts so I'm just looking for the gearings.

I already contacted @Nowind of E-Toxx and I think he only sells them with the mounts so it might not be a good bet for me. Thanks in advance.

You can buy the gears only, no problem.
90€ pair of Wheelsprockets with screws and spacers 50tooth
30€ pair of Motorsprockets with 8mm bore,  9 or 11tooth
20€ pair of chains
( dont know the right length for other mounts, so you get 1m and two couplers to make yourself) 

Cheers

Hey Jens, do you think ISO-05B is secure with 12S powered builds (with ROXXYs for instance)?

Chaindrive is not the strongest one IMO
Belt or Direct are better for high power Setups

Belts slip and rip too much when offroading because of things getting stuck in there. 
In winter belts lasts less than 10 min in ice or snow before getting hard and brittle and ice caught in there then snaps. If nothing is stronger than belts then idk what else can help us. Maybe the sealed direct drive??

I have used CD long time...
with using stronger setups and riding harder it started to fail more often... But this was with really torque setups, i guess with Vesc setups its more easy on the drivetrain, i cant tell what you should do because it seems absolutely depending on the user, some love it and other dont...

Belt was nice smooth and super strong BUT failed brutaly with mud and dirt, special runs in the autum woods ruined the belts super fast... also drag was higher with my 25mm Belt and Roller Setup

Actually Direct Drive seems to be the best solution actually, low drag, sealed against dirt, super strong by high power setups... downside can be named that its louder then the Belt, little heavier also

I second this, not only is it better than chain and belt, but it also looks badass. Way cleaner than any other setup. Nice and compact and doesn't even extend past the wheel. For the price you pay to get your chain setup complete, it sounds like a better move to just spend an extra couple hundred and get it instead

Hey Jenso, can you check your inbox? I sent you some message inquiring about Direct Drive, i think i might just go with direct drive instead of chain.

This is the smaller ISO-04 !!!
For the V1 Kits its correct, but most people will have the V2 ... it have ISO-05 !!!

This is the V1, it clamps with one screw :

This is the V2, it has two setscrews for clamping :
