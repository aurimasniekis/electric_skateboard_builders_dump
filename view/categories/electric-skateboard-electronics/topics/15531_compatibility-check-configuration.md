Would a 10S4P battery set up be fitting with a 192kV Turnigy SK3 motor? Also, what configuration is needed for a 99wH battery (or anything fitting with FAA/Airline) regulations? Lastly, would this batt http://www.reddotrc.com/index.php/haiyin-4-cells-5000mah-25c.html be enough just for testing (not full on riding yet) Thanks!

Yes 10S4P would get you around 40km/h assuming 15/36 gearing. There are many configurations. Use the formula Volts X Amp Hours to get your wh. Yes that battery would be ok if you connected two in series to make 8s. 4s isn't enough to power an eboard.

10S4P with Samsung 25R should have 10 * 4 * 2.5A * 3.6V = 360 Watt/hr

Rule of thumb would be 1km for each 10watt/hr so you should be getting 36-40kms like @lox897 said

There is no simple answer for this question, you will have to read a lot, watch all VESC videos even Vedders, there's an inmense amount of tricks you should be aware of in order to keep your VESC from blowing.
