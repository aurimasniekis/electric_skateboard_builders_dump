Hey Guys,

I was working on a brake light and fought the bits to move around.
It will read out the ppm signal and according to that play the animations and in the right speed.
 
- idle mode (red)
- driving (red, green, black-bar rolling down)
- driving faster, faster (red, green, black-bar rolling down)
- brake (only red)
- full break (only red strobo)

Do you got any suggestions?

So you would like to have another knob on your remote - to signal your direction?
Find that too distracting. But its easy to implement.

Ohh I see - there is **NO white** only green and a "black" bar moving down.
The iPhone X cam does not do a good job.

Brightness is at 54 of max 254.

I would'nt mind. Either push buttons on the remote or a a XY trigger axis. Like the nunchuk
