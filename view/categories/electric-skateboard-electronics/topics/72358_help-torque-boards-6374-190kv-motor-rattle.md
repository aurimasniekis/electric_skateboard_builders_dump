I recently built my first electric skateboard I am using the torque boards 6374 190kv motor and 12s 2p battery , after just to ride my motor started making noise like a rattling inside I didn‚Äôt get any dropping power or noticeable drop in performance but when I got home after further inspection of the motor I can see through the seam between the part that mounts to the motor mount itself and the barrel that spins there is something inside that looks like a ring or a plate that is moving back and forth and jiggling around please help how do I fix that what is that has anybody dealt with this in the past any help with this  would be greatly appreciated  Thanks!![image|375x500](upload://mUWFVSCeR8uUtRH7toyGHsLPcfg.jpeg)

That's the magnet retaining ring mine came loose too I just cleaned it up and used 648 retaining compound and pushed it back in place. You have to let it set for 48 hours then you can ride again.

Yeah.  That‚Äôs usually how things go down with them! 
I do like @Battosaii answer better than mine.  Try that n hopefully that will get you back on the board for the weekend.  
I would definitely have them replace the motor regardless

You just remove the snap ring and the spacer and the motor pulls apart.

Bad application of the Loctite at the factory or shitty Loctite it's a manufacturer defect. It's a recent issue cause they didn't have this issue before. Hopefully TB can have this sorted out soon but alreast it's an easy fix.

Safety precaution: BE FUCKING CAREFUL putting the can back on the motor, it will snap into place so hard and without warning it can probably take a finger off

@Battosaii yeah  they are definitely not  known for being bargain brand parts ,so I guess we‚Äôll see what they decide to do.

@Battosaii one last question on this subject , we‚Äôre do I apply the glue around the intire ring ? Or just on the  magnet contact points ? Not sure don‚Äôt want to screw or up.

there's no need for that, usually its enough to just tag them here and TALK to them. there's no need to get mad, even if it is frustrating. Hell, i ordered the wrong mount from them and ran the mount for a week, didnt like it, told them and they sent me some new ones and i mailed the USED mounts back. it was 100% my fault for ordering the wrong part. and most places after u have mounted the parts wont return or replace them w/o a defect from the manufacturer.

I was at first like whoa that's a little harsher vocabulary than @b264 usual, But then I saw the warning and then I drooped a beat. Thanks for warning us. Fingers are more like carrots and noting like hardened steel.

i made a apparatus for removing and putting cans back on.

take a giant c-clamp (make sure its not cheap or galvanized metal) take 2 stips of metal and make an "X" and tack weld it together to line up on the motor holes on the can, w/ a drill press make holes in the newly made "X" piece that line up with the motor holes and then weld the "X" to the c-clamp

(if u get the c-clamp w/ a hole in the bottom then u can skip this step)
Next take the c-clamp and drill a 9-11mm hole (this is for the motor shaft to feed through 
after that make another "X" piece and repete the process for the stator side of the motor and line up holes etc... punch the same 9-11mm hole in the "X" and weld it in place...


presto ur done, u now have a device that wont allow ur motor to snap on u, it has to be twisted in place

@Brasstackzach What's your email? I don't think we seen your email.

Typically, we recommend you don't open the motors unless you have experience doing so.

But you can send it back and we can do the repair if you like.

I agree the whole magnet thing chomping your fingers off is a possibility. Don't do it unless you know what your doing.

I've barely put 100 miles on a pair of 6380's that I paid a crazy amount of shipping in order to make the Bakersfield race after returning my 6374's for because of this issue. My 6380's are now doing the same things. Seems like these motors are a no go now. Sucks because I could've just bought a couple pairs of cheaper motors and not be worried about it and saved money in the end. I'm totally bummed at the performance of TB's motors at the moment. None of the motors have taken longer than 30-40 miles before they start sounding horrible. Their old motors were awesome and never had these kinds of issues.
