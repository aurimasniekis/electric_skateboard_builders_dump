Has anybody ever tried to re bind the controller for a boosted board or evolve board to a diy board?
Wondering if it's possible because I love the evolve controller. 
Thanks

Feature, the hud is really convenient cause it shows things like battery % and/or distance remaining.

i've heard the data is not that accurate, and will suddenly drop if you hit a hill or some grass...

but I agree, I just use my phone to record distance/speed, then battery range - distance = remain distance :wink:
