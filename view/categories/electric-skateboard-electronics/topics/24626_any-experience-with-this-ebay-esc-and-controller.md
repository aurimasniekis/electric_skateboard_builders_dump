Hey guys, so i've been doing some shopping around and was wondering if anyone has had any experience with this ebay ESC and remote? I saw a few forum posts but not definite conlcusions. 

Also, I am looking to build a single motor belt drive board. However, If I use  turnigy 192 kv motor it will be too many watts for the single motor ESC they offer (up to 1300 watts). Therefore, could I somehow use this dual motor one (up to 2600 watts) to power one motor?

Would love to hear your thoughts!
