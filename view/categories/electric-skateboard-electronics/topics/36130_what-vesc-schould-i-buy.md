hey there!
I am building an electric longboard. I have all the parts I need, expect a Vesc! I tried now for two months an esc but it didn´t worked well! So now I want to buy me a Vesc and I want that the Vesc have breaks! Like the boosted board :) And also nice to have would be regenerative breaks! So i can charge the battery while I am breaking. Could anyone give me some tipps where I can buy a good and cheap Vesc? I want to spend max 120€ for the Vesc and I live in Austria, so it will be better when I get it from Europe and not from America or Australia!! (Shipping costs!)

excuse me for my bad english!

Hope someone can help me!
:clap:
