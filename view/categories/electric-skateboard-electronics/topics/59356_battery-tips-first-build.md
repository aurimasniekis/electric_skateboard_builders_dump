From what I read it seems that I should use a 10s or 12s battery for this kind of configuration. What kind of battery, without spending too much, do you think would be suitable for the project? Would something like this work?

To spend less i could also go for 18650 but i don't have a spot welder, is there a reputable place where i can find preassembled 18650 packs? Can you suggest me some websites where I could find good batteries for this kind of project?
