I've misplaced the cable that comes with my Photon remote. I'm looking to buy a cable to connect it to my Unity. Can I buy the correct one "off the shelf", or will I have to modify it to support the VESC 4 setup?

I've seen posts that there are issues with the Photon getting telemetry from the Focbox. Just curious if that's been resolved.
