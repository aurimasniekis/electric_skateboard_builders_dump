I heard that.  Maybe something was changed and whoever is selling them now they will run it.  What's the story?

I ran mine in FOC - got a DRV error in one of my VESCs - the VESC rebooted and everything was fine but I did not feel comfortable to ride it in FOC anymore.
Don't know about anybody else though...

Jacob said a few times that on order to run his hubs in FOC you need to upgrade shunts on your vesc. Doubt if anyone tried that tho.

Just curious why it was an issue or why it could ever be an issue.  Maybe the winding he did or something.   Surely they could've gone FOC with a change?
