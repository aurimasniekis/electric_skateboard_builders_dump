Hello
I am attempting to use a Wifi to UART bridge. It's an ESP8266 with custom firmware. I have it working as an AP, but for some reason I can't connect via BDLC to the VESC. I already have the same baud rate on both the bridge and VESC. Any pointers?
thanks
Leo

yes I cross-posted it there, but it seems that so many people here are using the VESC that someone might know
thanks
