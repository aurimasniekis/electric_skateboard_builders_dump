I'm building a 12s4p pack with 30q cells to torqueboards car ESC running TB 6374 190KV x2. What bms should I use and where should I get it?

Bestech is usually the way people go for BMSs. Also just a small tip for your build - make sure those ESCs have plenty of ventilation or theyâ€™ll overheat quickly

Thanks for the tip. Where do I get a bestech? Their site doesn't seem to provide any store front.

The minimum order is 2, I think.  It's better to find a group buy in this forum.

you contact them direct by email. 

2 module minimum per order. 

I've got a big order coming so just get them from me.

this one's a charge only so discharge will have to be bypassed.

You would get it in the mail, I'm not gonna drive it to your house...I mean, unless you've got lots if beer and a helluva nice couch for me to sleep on ðŸ˜€. 

Seriously, all I was saying was that way you can buy 1 BMS instead if 2.

I'm getting 5 10s and 5 12s, charge and discharge with E-Switch. Essentially like the old model with decent balance current.

There's not really a model number, they are making them custom on the old 10s/12s frame.
