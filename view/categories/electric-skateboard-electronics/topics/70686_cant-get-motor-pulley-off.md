Cant get the motor pulley off iv the tried heat gun,levering it,pulling with a vice grip dunno what to do.. need it off to change the motor.. grub screws are loosened...it actually pulled the shaft outa place. i dont know what to do? I used blue loctite putting it on but heat shoulda loosened it ![20181009_174814|666x500](upload://kjqlRzdZA7i5AEgGpurDp3iSxrS.jpeg) ![20181009_174811|666x500](upload://8WgSn7Ryoy44WIRjzKiUDKM1mKy.jpeg) ![20181009_174817|666x500](upload://6ptLdeyFSpG0NOKIkdustjBJrf5.jpeg)

Heat gun is weak. Use a torch

Yeah, hold a blow torch up to the pulley for a minute and all your problems will be solved :rainbow:

My heat gun heats the pulley up to the point where it evaporates water very quick tho how hot does it need to be?

Same problem here. No glue and no bolts inside the pulley and it wont loose :confused:

Heat until the loctite smokes. I have a hot air welder and a few minutes of directed heat on the pulley while turning it to cook it evenly gets even bearing lock hot enough to come off. Small gas torch would be good if you can't get a powerful hot air gun. (Hair dryer don't cut it)

Cant you slide the motor out without removing pully on TB mounts?

I had similar problems with aluminum pullys.
It was corroded on

Also completely remove the grub screws rather than just loosening them

Is there a key/keyway? If so, did the pulley slide in smoothly when you installed it? I had my pulley stuck once because the key didn't fit the pulley well. I had to force it out and sand it down a bit.

In this case I think a gear puller is what you needed to use

@stormboard1 I don't want to hear you more about the heatgun, bro. I'm getting pissed every time you mentioned. :grimacing::rofl: Forget about that piece of c....! Listen to our fellow forum members.... use a T-O-R-C-H !

...once you apply the flame over the pulley you wait 'till you see a little smoke coming out, thats the melting compound volatizing. Then you'll be able to pull it out.

i've used these pullers but pulling against the flange will tend to bend or pull them off altogether.

would recommend 2/10

that depends on the pulley though right?

I've pried of the flange on the TB pulleys, I'm sure the gear pulley would not work on those, from the looks of the first post and LHB's post, those look beefier

I glue my Trampa aluminum pulleys with green Loctite equivalents. Then use some heat (torch, mini torch or strong heat gun), and pull them off with the bearing extractor tool (10 uSd within my country). Save my pulleys, fast change gearing, plus alway glueing and not having loose pulley issues...

You need more practice with the angle grinder ðŸ¤£

Just messing with you man.
Mine was not seized, a Hudy hex tip broke into the set screw. These things are very hard and no matter what I tried I could not drill it out so I had to cut the pulley where the set screw was to remove it.

Ya no.worries... What I did.after was lightly file the motor shaft to just to take and "inth" off and the other one slid on/off with a better tolerance

I will second what @thisguyhere said you need a gear puller and some heat.  If you have a fine tipped soldering iron you could probably stick that on the grub screws to heat up the loctite around them
