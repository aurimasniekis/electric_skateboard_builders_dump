[This](https://www.orbtronic.com/30a-18650-3120mah-battery-high-drain-rechargeable-flat-top) Panasonic Orbtronic battery has killer specs, however I haven't seen Mooch tests online.

They even advertise it as 40A max discharge!

It's also pretty expensive, anyone knows anything about it?

This cell does not exist in Panasonic's portfolio. For using the brand "Orbtronic" with Panasonic is fishy as well as the 30 amp max continuous discharge rating. There's clearly no 40 amps discharge 18650 cells on the market according to Mooch.

orbtronic doesn't actually produce cells or perform r&d of their own liion chemistries, which often run into the hundreds of millions in cost. anyway, they usually just rewrap cells and put protection on them. I'd be wary of any outlandish claims coming from this brand.

Mooch just replied to my test request from his Facebook account:

Buy one and test it, or look into es battery forum, they will test them for you if you send them one.

But it think this is just scam..

Mooch offered to test it if there is enough demand.

Someone would need to ship one to him
