will using covered water resistant motor give me problem with temperature because its not getting enough airflow? i plan on running 10s3p batteries...likely not pushing board to max...plan on maybe going...30km/h which is about....18 miles/h.

You should be fine. Are you running a single motor? More chance of overheating if you run a single on hills and are heavy?

You should be fine. The battery can't really push enough amps to overheat those motors.
