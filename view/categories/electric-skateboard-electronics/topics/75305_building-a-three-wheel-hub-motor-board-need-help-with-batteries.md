Hello everyone, this will be my first topic here and as expected its asking for help. I am quite new to building electric longboards, but as I am from Toronto its a great way to get around. Unfortunately the roads in my area are terrible and urethane just wont cut it, no matter how thick. I was considering doing a eMTB build but saw videos of people riding their onewheels in snow!

After doing some research I came across this ['little guy'](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10inch-10-inch-10x6-00-5-5-wide-tyre-brushless-gearless-dc-wheel-hub-motor-balance/32823573279.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.39.6f08465e6Bn5LG&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_1_10065_10068_10130_10547_319_317_10548_10696_10924_453_10084_454_10083_10618_10139_10920_10921_10307_10922_537_536_10059_10884_10887_100031_321_322_10103,searchweb201603_51,ppcSwitch_0&algo_expid=1bbf6b54-14d9-422d-aa18-e693b51072b8-5&algo_pvid=1bbf6b54-14d9-422d-aa18-e693b51072b8)

For those who don't wish to open the link here are some photos:

This super wide hub motor comes in a variety of power outputs (250W, 350W, 500W, 600W) and voltages (24V, 36V, 48V, 60V)

My plan is to strap it as the back wheel on a longboard with the front two being trampa 9 inch wheels, or something similar. The best part would be when the snow hits as Id love to attach snowmobile like skis for some real fun!

Here is a rough 3d model I made:

I really want to use the 600W version of the motor but want to know a few things;

Does it need a disc brake? Or is breaking something that is handled by a VESC.

Which VESC should I purchase, flipsky or focbox?

What do I use to power this? Whats the best BMS, and should I go with Samsung 30Q or other cells in a specific configuration or Lipo packs?

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you!
