I was rushing and yeah then it happened switched the polarity of my battery connector to the vesc.. the vesc started smoking i then disconnected the focbox and tried to see if it worked with the polarity as it should, but it seems like one of the components is fried.. see image. Guess ill have to get a new vesc because i dont know how to replace pcb parts. Now another thing i was wondering is if my battery is damaged (10s2p bestech bms)?? It lost about 10% charge and it was warm for a while.. ![20190501_180850|375x500](upload://h24BpyfOPlTimcoKj6N0PcqjLir.jpeg)

@JohnnyMeduse fixes them (focboxes/escs) !

There are a couple of forum members that repair them for a decent price. Try the Wizard (@JohnnyMeduse)

I did the same on accident with my two vanda's but they still work fine. The smoke only burnt some wires from the batt to the vesc and nothing else.

Probably. Theres not really much that can go wrong in that situation in regards to the cells. Get a multimeter and check.

So no burnt connectors/wires? If not you should be fine. Keep an eye out on the battery every so often. Just cause you dont see damage, doesnt mean that a cell or two didnt take damage. 

I built a 12s1p lipo and did the same thing. Reversed and it sparked. Connectors and wires were fine. Went on a ride, got back and opened her up only to find one of my 2s1p had puffed bad. Not saying its your case. Just something to be cautious of.

A drv fault almost always renders a vesc completely useless until it's replaced.

@JohnnyMeduse for the OG wizard, but @ThermalM16 is another option if you're mid USA

@ThermalM16 is another option
[/quote]

Can vouch for him. Did a drv replacement on mine. Works good as new. Affordable as well

The motor cant spin up if there is a broken MOSFET. That one must be replaced before trying anything else. 
If there was a noise from the motor, maybe the DRV is not broken since it tries to do its job. 

I replaired two focboxes yesterday actually but those where my last DRVs unfortunately. I will restock though. Im in sweden btw

Okay cool might consider sending it, but look at the pcb damage though idk if its too far gone ðŸ¤”![20190501_215113|374x500](upload://snxxlNp6fGn2Vdu3yo2d556MU6u.jpeg)

@ThermalM16 repaired the blown fet on mine by doing some voodoo magic.

Yes it doesnâ€™t look too good. 
By connecting the battery with the wrong polarity, the battery got shorted through the mosfets. A lot of current went through the pcb traces. 
 You can remove the broken mosfet with a heat gun if you do it with caution. Then you can see the severity.

I can replace components but if the PCB needs a lot of repair I rather avoid it.

The broken transistor looks like it has been spot welded now :confounded:) Dont try to pull it off if it wonâ€™t come loose. That might increase the damage.. maybe you need a dremel for that part. 

If you donâ€™t want to mess with it now you could send it but then I canâ€™t guarantee anything. Iâ€™m really curious about how it looks underneath that mosfet :nerd_face:

Well I tried to take it off and it did work but the tabs on one side wouldnt come loose kinda messed it up I guess ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜ª but it looks pretty fried underneath anyway.  I already ordered a new vesc so dont need this one atm I could send it to you so you can see what u can do with it and possibly fix it. ![20190502_201114|375x500](upload://oaI6LWmmcXtu2CRpy6CJs3MAcmq.jpeg)

@Martinsp does repairs in europe.  I'd be checking the bms if its a discharge set up.  When I did the same thing it fried my bms and 1 vesc.

Lucky you lol.  Mine went off like a firecracker and scared the shit out of me.  Definitely the drv on the vesc then.  Worth having it repaired.

That mosfet always seems to be the one that fries.  Better minds than mine could explain why and whether its worth fixing.  Hopefully an expert will chime in because I'm at the limit of my limited capabilities right now.  Good luck

Hey guys, I had a DRV replaced on Focbox #1 last week as I had the usual DRV8302 fault in the BLDC tool. Then, when I went to reprogram the vesc for the first time, it would seem, the middle MOSFET blew... Unfortunately this particular transistor seems to be out of production. Can anybody confirm where to get a few?
My electrician told me it is: IRF7749L2TR1PBF
He actually told me to get 6 to replace them all just in case... is that true?
Is there anything else I should make sure to check before I fry this indefinitely?
I haven't even got 40 km's on the board and I've already had to tear it apart. 
Breaks my heart...
