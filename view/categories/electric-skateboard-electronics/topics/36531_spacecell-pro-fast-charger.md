I'm looking to charge a little faster and of course all the enertion parts are discontinued. Does anyone know what the max amperage is for the spacecell input or a particular fast charger that may work with it?

The fast charger is 4 amps with a 5.5x2.1mm header. You can find them on aliexpress or ebay pretty easily.

Do you have a link to the original "slow" charger? I've seemed to lost mine and have no idea where to get a new one.
