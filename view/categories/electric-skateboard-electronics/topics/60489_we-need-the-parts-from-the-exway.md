This is the bluetooth remote controller, it can also turn the board on and off, if they can why the hell can we not do it?

On/off is due to the ESC - with a VESC it's just not possible.

Magnetic port - why not magsafe as I have done?

DieBieMS *may* change slightly in H/W with a little extra S/W to support push-start which is even better.

If you can turn on the board using the remote then there will always be a battery drain...wonder if it goes into proper off when hitting a batt min, if not then could damage the pack eventually 

Push-start uses the push to provide the starting power allowing the board to be truely powered down

If designed correctly you can put a MCU into deepsleep that only draws a few microamps and poll for a wake up from the remote. It would literally take years for the board to take any harm.

Yes. The company was found by @kalebludlow

He has some experience buying from taobao, maybe you could order 50 and get them in your location as being in Lima is more difficult and help the community if they work as advertised.

@kalebludlow please ask them if they have a 50v capable port in male and female

In fact, the exway's charging port is custom made. The original charging port can only withstand 24v.![QQ%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE20180701171327|690x403](upload://Aj3il3Yh0zUlQePxPy8QHmRtHga.png)![QQ%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE20180701171614|473x386](upload://y0EcKKOA6zPSB4eVHqG2kjPfS6k.png)

The bad news, the manufacturer told me that the stock of the port's wires has been used up, and custom-made 1-meter-long port wires require an additional payment of 1,000 (CNY). Shit, I don't like it.
DC 24V；5A MAX no electronic wire

Their engineers told me that they have tested 220V and can still use it normally.

I have a couple spare parts for the Exway (motors, rear Seismic trucks, and ESC). Been riding a review unit for a while and I would say it's unbelievably smooth and powerful for a hub motor board that's not the Raptor 2 :P . I can take pictures of any part of what I have on demand if anybody's interested. Only issue is the ESC is encased in opaque black resin and it's impossible to tell what's going on under there. I only know it's FOC...

There is actually no key surprisingly, though it looks like there should be. You can unscrew the motor from the hangar with that bolt at the end. I'm not sure how it stays put because i haven't been able to take the motor apart to see. 

These are the production hubs and parts that ship with every board. I write eskate reviews on Reddit and most recently ESHQ, and have a review unit on hand. Exway just started selling and providing proper support from their Exway USA distribution branch, and they want to prove they're using custom high quality parts and such, so they sent me extra parts to look at and mess with. The caveat is I have to send them back which is fair.

So I haven't finished writing my review on it yet and I still have a couple power tests to run but in my opinion, it's a really high quality, well tested product designed with lots of attention to detail and good active support. I can quote a few sections from my review to give you an idea of what I think about it (Please note: It's unfinished!):

"The remote is just about the best I've ever tried as well. I'd say that it's even more ergonomic than the Boosted and WowMeepOwn remotes as far as these thumbwheel remotes go and the connection has been 100% flawless. There's only one button, "Button A", that switches between speed modes, and a debug and calibration menu you can access on startup by continuing to hold down Button A for 5 seconds. A DFU mode is also accessible as well[...]"

"[...] app enables a multitude of options including adjusting top speed, acceleration curves, braking curves, acceleration current (strength of acceleration), and braking current (strength of brakes) for all four speed modes individually [...] This is the highest level of customization I've seen in a production board [...]" 

"On the other hand, the batteries used leave much to be desired. Riding in hilly SF, you can hit their advertised 10 miles of range if you stay in speed mode 2-3 and weigh 125lb or below, but you would have to try extremely hard. The battery also sags a lot too, and I do mean suuuuper sags. The remote will warn you about it and sooner or later you will just be limited to speed mode 1. This happens at around 30% and below when going up hills at speed. If you ride along mostly flat ground though, you will be just fine. [...] the cruise control mode is not dynamic like Mellow, so you will slow down or speed up depending on incline [...]"

"Exway originally sent me a loaner review unit that they told me to beat up on as much as I could to see if anything would break, and nothing did. Now they're using it on their tour and Instagram photos. [...] After a while into my time with the X1, I found myself grabbing the X1 for short trips within SF City Proper instead of my DIY because it's super light and convenient and just a really fun ride on mode 4 [...]"

"Ultimately though it's up to you. If you're looking for range and straight up power, this board is not for you. The seismic trucks and nature of hub motors means that customization in terms of bushings and wheels is limited as well. However, If you're looking for a pretty good power and a short-medium distance commuter, I wholeheartedly recommend the Exway X1."

Hope this helps!
```

Can you ask them if they are willing to sell remotes and receivers on their own?

Thanks! sounds good but still want to know how those hubs hold out after a couple months before thinking about getting one. I rode an m1 along the embarcadero daily for commute and had to get rid of it as the motors died every couple months.

Edit if only carvon would deliver them exo pros =/

I know a guy thats been shredding his for the past year or so (He is an official exway eu seller) they were good when i tried it.

Only thing i personally disliked on the one i tried was the insane concave but it was an earlier model so not sure if it makes a difference.

Roughest road I used it on was the broadwalk on the embarcadero SF. I had to replace motors after about 2-3 months, 3 times without fail. It's a very unreliable hub.  Same issue Everytime also. And was def told it was an engineering issue by thier support lol

I'm hearing what I'm writing directly from Exway in China. I will clarify again, but unless there is an interpretation error, when I asked if they were using vescs they said something along the lines of no but it's a derivative.

I'll edit my OP for now so people don't get confused... This is why I typically don't post unfinished work 😬

Most likely custom made, its easy to do though.

3D print a cover, make a mold out of the printed one find a magnet put it in the mold poor silicon into it let it be good and its good.

Or cut it out of some silicon stuff.

About 3 months ago I purchased my first board, an Exway.  Loved it but I quickly ran out of range.  I especially liked the remote and the smooth takeoffs with quickly building acceleration.  I purchased a Bamboo GTX to solve my range problem.  Love it even more because of the carving (surfer, not skateboarder), except even after a month of 5 to 10 miles daily I have not gotten used to the remote and the sudden starts.  No drop out or connection problems yet.  I haven't decided what to do with the Exway.  Can I swap the Exway ESC or VESC (it wasn't clear to me that was settled in this thread) and remote into the Evolve board?  I can turn a screwdriver and solder and such.  I miss the Exway app also.

Sorry for dropping in late.  This thread was just too applicable to not give it a try.

the ESC in exway is for hub motors. Most likely it won't run as nice with evolve outermotor. The simple things you can do to change to vesc in the evolve and you can use whatever remote vesc compatible. Or if you like everything of the exway expect range, change the battery.

Just got my exway, it’s got a fair amount of Torque, pulls even a big guy like me up hills (110kg) obviously worried about range, and wondering battery upgrade options? 

@sofu do you remember how much room is in the battery pack? Ideally I want to be able to add another 12s2p in parallel on the deck or wondering how much room in the battery compartment there is if you made the board a bit thicker.

If make the decks little thicker or cut through, I think there’s room for a 12s3p pack in there.

@Winfly how do you find the lofty direct drive motors, are they worth investing in over the exway riot or Hub motors?

Im keen to Swap them on to this board with the double trucks.

How well do they handle the torque
Compared to a conventional setup gear and pulley system like with the riot. 

Tempted to sell the riot pack and install lofty direct drive.

they are strong in torque and give you full urethane wheel options. brakes are strong and ideal to use with VESC idk about the 12S hobbywing esc in the exway. keep in mind that it's DKP so very carvy and will be very unstable at high speed. also you will need big wheels like 107, 110 in order for the motors to not always bottom out. I'm riding them with 97 and hitting shit all the time. its kinda annoying when you loose traction. if you have smooth pavement then that's a non-issue.

I remember Acton did this with there Kickstarter boards, but they eventually discontinued because the cutout thru the board wasn’t stable.

@snowriderau Be careful because it does seem like it can definitely could snap in half. You should have just add layers of fiberglass on top and made the job easier.
