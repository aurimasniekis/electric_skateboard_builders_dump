So I update my firmware vesc to 3.34. Now when I try to use the BLDC tool it won't connect. I check the BLDC and there's a firmware where you can click from the top area and it says : Support Firmware(for this version of BLDC Tool)
2.17
2.18
Since my vesc 3.34 now could this be the reason why it won't connect ?
