Hey

Can I run my sensored motor on my sensored/sensorless ESC if I don't connect the sensor cable? And if so, can I then connect the 3 motor cables any which way like you normally would with a sensorless motor?

Just connect without sensor and make sure you get   a good push off before you accelerate. You can switch the motor wires around no problem if you go sensorless.

Are you using a VESC? Maybe the motor detection didn't run well. Try running it again
