They are starting to spam on the E-Board pages and I got a kick out of this.

After reading how good they are, i thing OllinBoard co. can close its doors.

I feel sorry for @chaka.

these are not 680uf caps on this thing. I dont know why i am not surprised....

But the solder joints are beautiful..

I don't even have a sense of humor when it comes to these vescs. They can't even solder a nice joint. There advantages aren't advantages, since besides the counterfeit parts, everyone does those. As far as I'm concerned, more players in the vesc game mean more bad news for the vesc. Since Vedder doesn't think any of chakas updates are necessary, the market will continue to be flooded with inferior quality vescs.

It was received last week directly from the factory. 

@evoheyax, v6 is coming and that will change the game significantly. At least for some months. :slight_smile:

They were put into a dual config by somebody else who didn't get them working (FW 2.16, also containing the max ramp step error). I re-uploaded bootloader and installed a bug free FW 2.18 and sent them back to him. We'll see how they'll perform.

"more players in the vesc game mean more bad news for the vesc."
So if only maytech was selling vescs, you would be happier?
more players means more options, you can always choose the best seller according to your preference.
Maybe it doesn't matter to you that there are now chinese companies in the market, because you don't like their products anyway, but for me (and for other people) the competition is better.
Notice how some other parts are manufactured in china, even parts that Enertion, Ollin, DIY and other sell. Sometimes chinese parts just offer a better value, and good enough quality.
Thats enough for my rant :slight_smile:

So I'm guessing you never had issues with Enertion vescs made in china? Both china vescs I bought from enertion had issues, one came broken and he other broke the second day. Chaka's vescs in the same build and setup, never broke, still good 8 months later. So there is a build quality difference. Chaka said he thinks one of the main reason vescs from china break so easily is poor manufacturing. And this looks worse in soldering quality than enertions did. So sorry if I'm doubtful, but I think a lot of people are going to buy them and have issues. Vedders BOM in certain places use 50v caps, while running 12s puts it over that at 50.4v. When I say more players in game mean more bad news, it's because there's been so many shitty quality manufacturers so far, mixed with the BOM that should be updated for those who are running at low voltages (which should be everyone in eskate), and you have a recipe for disaster. We need more manufacturers like chaka, who take the time to make changes to the BOM so that they don't break on people so easily. No, not everything from china is crap (I've been using maytech controllers for sometime with no issues until yesterday. But the vesc is not a simple controller, it's very delicate and complicated.

The more manufactures that build shitty quality vescs, the worse the reputation the vesc will get.

Aren't there any good ESCs from china? where do you think most of the motors come from?
Products in china have the potential to be good enough, and much better quality/price value.
When Enertion sold "crap" vescs from china, did the vescs from Ollin get lower reputation?
If the Chinese will sell bad vescs, their reputation will go down, and the good vescs reputation will go up.

The problem is, most are not going to understand why their vesc broke, just that it broke. Look, the whole reason Jason moved to the US was the problem of counterfeit components being put on the vesc. Motors are difference, as there is no circuitry involved. I'm not saying it's not possible for good vesc's to come from china, but just look at these photos, and like longhairedboy said, it looks like it was soldered by a drunk guy...

i would order and use Maytech motors. They're just fine. But I wouldn't touch this VESC with a 6 foot cattle prod. 

This current batch of Enertion vescs is pristine, btw. I can't really find anything wrong with them. The wires have been routed away from the pointy pins, the whole package is shorter, and the XT60 connector on the caps board is kind of genius. My only complaint is the shitty heat shrink which isn't really an issue and hardly worth mentioning. I like to re-shrink mine with heavier shrink before using them to make them a little tougher and also to include the caps board in the shrink. But the quality of the PCB and soldering and other important stuff is excellent.

forgot to mention the extra solder points on the caps board which makes jumping one vesc off the other a really simple thing.
