As I read the "easyyyy" I forgot you weren't a New Yorker.... I wonder if that trend is eslewhere ü§î

Now for my ontopic question: if you were to be honest how long would this take to learn if I know how to longboard, ski and surf. I feel like those would be the closest things I have in my 'tool belt', as I've never tried a snowboard

Never tried a snowboard, but alot of Skate / Wake / Kite Stuff
Started in my holidays, 3 Battery Charges a day, around 2 weeks and it started to feel very comfortable

Lifelong snowboarder, it took me about a week to feel comfortable just being at speed and about 3-4 weeks before I was carving and manually stopping. Surfing will probably be the closest thing to it if you've done that.

Hi folks, got the chance to catch a Leif at the bay but without controller and batteries.
Do anyone know the max voltage/amps to power these things. May want to use the electronic(vescs, remote and some lipos) of my mountainboard so...seen the most of you are powering with 8s... are 12s possible for the sliprings and motors?
How high i can set the motor current?

Greetings from Bavaria
