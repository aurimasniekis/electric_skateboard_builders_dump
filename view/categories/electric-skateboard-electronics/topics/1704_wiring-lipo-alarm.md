I was wondering if it is possible to wire the lipo alarm/tester to only turn on when using the board. My idea was tot connect the - from the lipo tester to the - of the lipo BUT after the loop key. That way the negative is only supplied when the loop key is plugged in. Is this correct?

If it's one of those two lead positive negative ones yeah but if it's the kind that plugs into the balance plugs no.

if it plugs in to the balance you could get a jst extension and put a dip switch on each lead.

all you need is to attach a on off switch to the 1st negative cable coming from the battery 
get one here:

yes its easy to do. just switch on the -Ve of the lipo and the alarm.
sorry @delta_19 you are wrong about not being able to do it. @mathieu was spot on in his first post.
