Hey everyone,

I've recently built myself an electric mountain board and I'm looking for some help with settings. After frying a couple of VESCs (didn't like either FOC mode, 12S or both) I'm a bit dubious to fiddle much more before asking!
Current setup:
* Keda 6356 190kv motor (2000w rated) X 2
* 15 tooth motor pulleys (15mm wide belts) 
* 72 tooth wheel pulleys
* 10S 10Ah 10C LiPo
* Turnigy Sk8 ESC (VESC 4.12) X 2

Current settings:
* BLDC mode
* motor 60A
* battery 50A
* regen 10A
* Startup 0.012

Currently done about 15 miles on it and it's amazing fun. I just feel it needs a bit more grunt for pulling away and grassy inclines. I will add cooling to the VESCs soon as I've noticed the temp cutout once or twice. Any tips / thoughts? Also is there a way to auto brake on Rx loss? My Transmitter ran out of battery when I was going down a hill, that was scary..
