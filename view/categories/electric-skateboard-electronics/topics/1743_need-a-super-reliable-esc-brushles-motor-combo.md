Hi all,

I am having major issues sourcing a 2 motor set up for my MBS. My requirements are:

-Corded throttle control. Let it be known that cordless vehicle controls are against federal law in the US. I live near NYC so radio is impossible. I cant put my life and that of other peoples at risk over a run away board. Besides NYPD is impounding wireless boards right now thanks to all the hipsters with the runaway Boosted/other hipster boards who refuse to use a lanyard. 

-Must be a 36-38v system. I run a 36v-20ah pack. 

-Must be durable for off road use Its going to get dirty. 

-Must be reliable. I have over 11k miles on my board right now. It has never ever broken down on me. I moved to chain early so other then a flat tire here and there I have had zero issues. I drive my board every single day weather permitting to and from work and any place around town I have to go. I average about 10-15 miles a day. On weekends I strap it on my enduro and take it into the woods for some fun here and there. I dont mind paying good money for good parts. My board is an electric vehicle that I rely on every day.

-My set up now will do 28-30mph with me on it running a single brushed 1000w. My average speed is between 20-26mph in most cases. It has to have enough juice to move my 270# at those speeds without turning into a toaster. Im not all that crazy about fast take offs. I drive in and with traffic a lot so my power range really needs to be between 20-26mph with a bit of head room. 

I have stayed on my brushed setup because between the quality brushed motor and the PG Drive controller its as reliable as it gets. However Its time for me to graduate to a lighter setup. My knees are not what they once where and popping my brushed motor off the ground has become painfull for me. Sadly sourcing these new parts has been a giant pain in the butt. I have burned a few hobby king ESCs. Turnigy is off the list. Those motors turn to toast with me on them. Clearly not designed for EV applications by any measure. 

So thats the entire story. I am open to anything thats corded and reliable.

Luckily, E-boards aren't vehicles...Wireless controls are not illegal

States are different but NJ and NY specifically state any vehicle with a motor propelling it is a motor vehicle and is subject to DMV rules. They define it the same way the federal gov does.

Federal law specifically defines a motorized vehicle the same way. Any vehicle propelled by a motor. Wireless controls are strictly forbidden on any and all vehicles transporting living beings of any kind. This includes electric skateboards. Any lawyer will tell you this is the case. Reasons are obvious.

Clown? I build boards for recreation because it's fun to longboard. I've been boarding for over 30 years. The vehicle relationship you are so attached to is only in question because of last mile marketing.  And it's guys like you that are going to fuck it all up for the rest of us!

Are you some kind of clown? Go troll some other thread? That is a load of dung. Spreading false information like that can land some poor college kid with a few thousand in fines.

I've never seen anyone get slapped with a few thousand dollar fine.. infact, I don't think I know of anyone here (from the U.S.) that got in any sort of trouble with police. 

I beleive they have told @Hummie to slow down or pulled him over in san fran, but I don't think it was over a wireless controller. Heck, people ride Boosted boards all over the place and they aren't getting drilled for having wireless controllers..

 @psychotiller is a legit member, and a moderator- by no means is he a "clown" or trying to troll your thread. 

It's not that I don't doubt your legal backing, its just that I don't think a single cop really cares (or even knows) that electric skateboards can't have wireless controllers... I haven't even heard that before, and have been buiding eboards for years. 

There also is a whole thread about legalities here:

Don't call @psychotiller a clown. He has contributed so much you don't even know. Don't come onto this forum and call him a troll and say bad things about him. That's not how we work.

Thanks guys and girl😁 . Bottom line, metro, boosted, altered, exskate, enertion, evolve, ego, and countless other manufacturers are legally selling their completes, online and in stores such as fry's electronics. All are wireless. 
Hmmmm...I do smell clown shoes in this thread, but I ain't wearing them .

Fuck you.
[/quote]

I love the word FUCK, and i use it a lot... but lets try not to directly use it towards others, maybe consider changing that post.

example of offensive & acceptable use of the word fuck.

> **"I don't like you —fuck you!"** This may offend somone because it's very direct and insulting so try not to use it that way unless you really fucking have too..
**"I'm tired of waiting. Fuck it, let's get out of here"** This still might offend some people but its not directed at someone, its used as an interjection instead of a verb.

No @onloop you aren't giving him the freedom of speech he deserves, he's in 'Merica  and here we can say *fuck you* to anyone, cops even. Honestly @psychotiller had cause for his post. Fuck that guy and fuck his laws. If you are pulled over buy a cop, longboarding isn't illegal, so its almost unenforceable.

If you read your reply its obvious to any vehicle builder in the US you have no idea what you are talking about so naturally I assumed you are trolling. Its nothing personal. Its been a long hard fight to keep ebikes and boards as viable options in most of the US. The online communities in particular are littered with hipster after hipster pushing illegal builds as innovative and reliable when what they are really doing is hoping enough people break the law so its impossible to enforce it. Of course that works up until the point when you the operator are held liable for operating that vehicle. 

People like me do the research. I have liability insurance for the work I do and it includes coverage for what ever electric vehicles I work on. The problem is not people like me who follow the rules and work to change them from the law abiding side its the people who operate these vehicles illegally forcing the law to be applied. Its also the builders who fill peoples heads with bull for obvious fiscal benefits. 

In NYC and NJ they are impounding all unregistered, uninsured motor vehicles. That means any vehicle with a motor, that does not have a plate, insurance and a license associated with it. Its illegal to drive any motor vehicle on the side walk. Its illegal to drive any unregistered or uninsured vehicle on the streets. The only place its legal in most states to drive any eboard is on your own property. Eboards under federal law with wireless controlls are against the law to operate in any state period. Even on your own property. States like Cali are full of people who ignore the law. Thats fine. However the same behavior in dense populated areas like NYC and NJ cant afford it. 

Last year for example some hipster was doing about 15mph on his boosted board. He passed the ferry station on the west side bike path. His board locked full throttle. He jumped off putting a young jogger in the hospital. His board stopped several hundred feet later after it shattered a mans foot and he broke his wrist when he fell to the curb. Naturally this was the tipping point and the community board took up the topic. Sure enough lots of other incidents started to become public knowledge. As it was clear the hobby was growing the NYPD was told to start enforcing the laws on the books. There have been several serious injuries and accidents related to cordless eboards just in the NYC area alone. Its clearly not the place to be operating illegal electric vehicles without insurance. 

The right person gets creamed by Joe hipster and its all over for everyone. 

-Driving without a license
-Driving without registration
-Driving without insurance

All of these have mandatory mins in most states. Its several thousand $ and a loss of license for up to one year. This is true in at least 2/3 of the states. So its all fine and well when you have a lot of money and you can afford an over priced lawyer but most people especially college students who are the most frequent users of these vehicles get absolutely screwed. Its life altering for those people. I think thats a pretty good reason for people to at least do minimal research.

You know what? You're full of shit. Every time you say hipster it shows more.  Your story, and your condescending tone here is complete bs. I've seen your crap on another forum somewhere else as well. If anyone needs to stop trolling it's you.  
15mph is laughable for a top speed emergency situation. 
You're a fucking idiot. And so there's no doubt, I mean it. And will not edit this post.

Mellow and some other companies lobbied the California government to instill similar laws because these laws are exactly identical with some of the specs of their shit $1000+ boards. the laws are bullshit and unfair. 
Next to my community college is a REALLY expensive neighborhood with 1M+  houses and they have 10yr olds with traxxas X-O1's blasting by at fuckin 100+kph. THAT Should be illegal, not longboards with outrunners and a 12S battery attached. 

Fuckin get your priorities straight

And  @njev how about deal with your own obvious insecurities about wireless, get a board that doesn't weigh 80lbs,  learn to actually ride a board and then come talk to us like you are part of the community. Or just go pedal insurance on an insurance forum.

If you are worried abt liability and fines....Just don't ride ... It ain't worth it....leave the road open to the rest of us that just enjoy the ride and our builds....


I'm a New Yorker....14th street Eastside is where I grew up....We did more stupid stuff and they still do more stupid stuff now ..

Use your head...don't be like that so called " Hipster " and cruise around when you don't know how to really ride....I ride downtown Vegas in the traffic....but I don't ride like I'm the only jerk on the road...I yield...cause that makes sense...id like to live to gnar another day.

You're on a site that the contributors all ride and build thier boards....don't come off waving your finger and warning people abt the laws...you will be hard pressed to find a Hipster here...

If you need help with your build ... I think you came to he right place....if it's something else ....just log off and forget your password
