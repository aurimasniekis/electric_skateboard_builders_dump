18650 12s4p battery pack, prebuilt with BMS, does it exist somewhere for purchase? I have been looking around, DIY sells a 12s3p i believe, space cell pro 4 is 10s4p if i remember correctly.

I think this is a job for the legendary @longhairedboy 
He'll use quality cells, BMS and wires and he has all the tools to do it. I might start making some once my spot welder is finished.

There seems to be a lot of interest in these. Let me figure out some pricing and packages and i'll post a thread in the market. 

i'm thinking packs with just generic 12S balance leads and  packs with BMS and Charger might be the options. 

I use ebike 4Amp chargers and i usually get my BMSs and chargers from batterysupports.com in case anyone was wondering.
