I'm trying to connect this battery indicator to my batteries set up in series, but it keeps showing up as 100% when connected to the output end of the series connector when the two batteries aren't even close to 100%. What did I do wrong?![20180310_014247[1]|666x500](upload://eUmnosTYEzDHZaXq6JJJWUEB0gH.jpg)![20180310_014315[1]|666x500](upload://n1GkO49AGcz878MGj0tCFBFoW0x.jpg)![20180310_014451[1]|666x500](upload://hv5CbaJeRHrDamKpj0AFk8xIHPQ.jpg)

I had no idea this had a programming function. That seemed to do the trick. Thank you.
