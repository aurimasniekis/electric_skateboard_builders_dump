I’ll be running two 6374 190kv motors with dual ESCapes and probably a large 10s something battery pack.

Is this mboard bms good enough or does anyone have any recommendations?

Will you be discharging through the BMS or bypassing it?

Oh god I have no idea. All I know so far is that I think I’m supposed to have one.

For discharging I would use a 80A or so model

You would do well to do a lot of reading about bms's before getting one.

Search "BMS" and it will bring up a lot of threads
