Hi, so when I turn off my remote, my skateboard motor goes to full rpms instantly. Only way is to turn off the board first. Anyone knows how to fix this issue?

Set your failsafe, depends on your remote

Do the remote rebind process one more time

What remote do you have? If you have GT2B or Mini it might be caused by the settings buttons on it...

Go into your bldc tools ppm tab and disable control first.

Then enable display and see what's happening when you turn off the radio.

Then check your failsafe to make sure it should be set to idle (or brake if you like)

Just turn your board of first all the time. I had this issue with my standard RC controller I used to use...

@darkkevind
 Though this is a good recommending in general it s not the bestsolution in this case as this same behaviour will happen in case of a connecting loss of remote(out of battery for example) and you totally don't want that to happen on top of the board.  So yeah,  turn board of before remote but fix your failsafe ASAP.

@darkkevind Yeah, but I'm 100% sure that at some point I will forget it and turn the remote off first. I'm pretty sure I'm slower than the board :smiley:
