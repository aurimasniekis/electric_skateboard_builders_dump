Hello, I am looking to find some cheap hub motors from Alibaba, does anyone have any experience with buying hub motors from there? If so which ones did you get and did they work for you?

IMO and a few others, the maytech hubs are the best. Kaspar, @unik and a few others have tried them out all with success I believe.

Either way, thermal efficiency of hub motors is poor. Castable polyurethane is a poor conductor of heat.
