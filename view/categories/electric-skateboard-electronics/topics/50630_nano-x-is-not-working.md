Hi,

I got a brand new nano-x that I bought here on the forum and itâ€™s not working.
The receiver is blinking in a weird way and not like itâ€™s searching for the remote - itâ€™s blinking slowly and nothing happen when I press the remote.
Anyone had this issue?

Thanks, 
Ishay

Just a stab in the dark - have you made sure that everything is fully charged prior to trying to connect?

Yup, Iâ€™ve connected a different remote and itâ€™s working great.

Another daft question, is the plug from the esc in the right way round?

Might be best to try and contact Enertion directly and see if they are able to assist. If not, then you've just blown a small amount of cash. I don't suppose that the seller will warrant the goods??

Did you tried to bind the remote to the receiver?

The binding happens automatically on The Nano-x remote.

Really? Seems odd. It flashes fast on the remote and reciever when I turn it on and then the remote flashes steady green and the reciever flashes slowly red.

HI @Ishayc

Have you tried contacting that person from which you purchased it?
Also advise him to contact support with your shipping details
need to know if he is eligible for replacement.

If itâ€™s the old model of the nano it needs to be bound

The instructions which came with the remote says that the binding happens automatically so it might be the newer model

@bigben , @barajabali and @Kug3lis - tried your suggestions and nothing worked. same as before, slowly flashing in red.
Any other suggestions?

I don't know if you are aware but there was a bad batch of nano x's a while back, you need to open the receiver and put more solder on the components, after that it will bind right away.

The problem is not charging or binding, do as I suggest and it'll be good to go.

It's U3 that had the problem on the old ones. You can try resoldering that (reflow or add a touch more).

Put flux on these pins and add some solder, the jst plug should have a better contact after and bind right away

Pin 14 looks crooked and not sitting on the pad properly. U3 also looks like not enough solder

I re-soldered so many components on this receiver lol but after adding some solder to the pins it worked. probably contact issues. Thanks!

Did your receiver have a rapid blinking light like mine?

It had a normal binding flashing light. 
Try adding solder to the pins it might do the trick.

IÂ´ll quickly jump on this topic with a question! :grinning:
Is it possible to charge my Nano-x with a powerbank? It would be nice to have a backup power source.
```

---
## \#37 Posted by: KTMinni Posted at: 2018-04-05T17:17:23.360Z Reads: 66

yep the nano-x is a simple plug and charge with micro-usb. however i'm not sure if you can use it while it charges...haven't tested that
```

## \#38 Posted by: wafflejock Posted at: 2018-04-05T17:35:04.576Z Reads: 67

```
Can always use the power bank at a quick stop for coffee or whatever for most remotes they aren't using power that quickly so with a quick 5-10 minute charge can ride for substantially longer than that (assuming charge rate is around 1A, say you have a 800mAh or .8Ah battery in the remote a full charge would be around 45-50 minutes and a 5 minute charge will give you 5/60*1A = .08Ah, .08Ah/.8Ah = 10% charged, wait 10 minutes and up to 20% charge which can last a long time... my custom remote pulls about 20mA on average so with that 10% charge can ride about 4 hrs).

Hey enertion, I was wondering why my nano x stays the same when I try to switch between beginner and advanced mode. It just doesnâ€™t change the boards performance at all.

I hope your VESC support both modes, if it's not supportable then both modes will stay the same

I don't think @CarlCollins gets it. Lol. Not sure why he won't just tell you instead of using terms like remotely or virtually that most won't understand or have never used or heard of. He wants to use a program called team viewer to remotely control your computer to do the setup himself.
