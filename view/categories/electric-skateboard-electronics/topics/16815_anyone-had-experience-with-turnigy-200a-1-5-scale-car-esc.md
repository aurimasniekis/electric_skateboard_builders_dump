Has anyone had any experience with the turnigy track star 200A car ESC on esk8's. https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-trackstar-1-5th-scale-sensorless-200amp-8s-opto-car-esc.html. My old ESC turnigy Dlux 80A HV fried running 8S and I am thinking of using this one as the replacement.

This is the esc that fried: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-dlux-80a-hv-brushless-speed-controller-opto.html 

Thanks

that 200A ESC seems like a little bit of overkill. most people get by with the 120A or 150A
but I guess for the price its still cheaper than VESC.. 

I have heard bad things about dlux..

I have had two of the 200 amp TURNIGY ESC's. Both no longer function correctly after 50 miles.

What happened to them did they burn out?

Definitely not worth it when you can get a VESC for 10 bucks less.

Yup. On one, I have to re-calibrate the throttle every time it's powered on.
