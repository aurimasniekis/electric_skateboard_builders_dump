Hello Guys,

I have recently started building my first electric longboard.

![Charing CIrcuit for the longboard|690x258](upload://2EcJPTOtnIykRjVYLF1t9Msrm42.png)

I am wondering if you guys can check this diagram to be correct or not.

Between Latch Switch (anti-spark) and Battery, I made a circuit port for charging the battery. When using the board or not charging the board, LOOPED anti-spark XT-90 will be connected. When charging, instead of that, XT-90 port from the balance charger will be connected as well as to the DB-9 balance charging port. 

Please do let me know if this circuit is good.

Thanks!
