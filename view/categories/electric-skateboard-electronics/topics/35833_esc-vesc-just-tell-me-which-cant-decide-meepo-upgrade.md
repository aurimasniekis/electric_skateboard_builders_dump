Hi,

Ive read tons of material and am no closer to making a correct decision...so lets lay it out..i have a meepo and using what i can to progress forward..

they said they thought the stock esc could handle a 10s3p battery but beyond that is questionable...
Im trying to go at least 10s4p maybe 6p at some point. (lith-ion)

at any rate later on I may grow and swap in belt drive motors, or hubs with more watts and all that jazz, but right now the top priorities are affordable/cheap esc/vesc and reliable... as in no fires or board on melt down..

what I like or want to retain:
use same remote i have
regen braking is nice, over charge protection as well if possible
auto on feature meepo has is nice but can sacrifice it

tell me what to do people... please =)

with your upgrade at the end of the day, all you're going to have that's original are the hubs. You might as well go full diy.

we're in process, im on a budget like everyone else... 

first stop already done... 2 new battery backs... 
next stop is esc/vesc..and here we are =P

I was feeling those AT tires from diyeboard... so maybe that... but even a new deck could come first as meepo deck isnt my fav, but gets the job done for now

I run my meepo on 10s4p just fine. They sell a 10s5p pack with these motors and esc and it works just fine. I just run the extra battery I got with my meepo in parallel with my original then attach that to the esc. Works just fine.

good info... i asked kieran what the esc could handle and 10s3p was his reply... i got a couple cheap 10s packs on ebay that some other people here said werent a bad deal, but didnt wanna parallel em and fry the esc based on his response.... i would love to 6p everything... but 2 packs from ebay and 1 pack with the meepo sounds like a bad combo from what i read... unless they were all the same batteries which i doubt they are...

ok...so i think im going 10s8p... is that overkill? i cant handle this 10s2p shit lasting 90min while i mob around nyc making deliveries...and having fun... new build my friends... i got a new deck coming... and got 4 - 10s2p batteries in hand for a e bike build but trying to go for a swappable battery that fits both the bike and board.... then try and mold a new cover from kyrex... saving everything meepo except the deck...hopefully no issues from the esc

that's pretty overkill, how much range are you looking for? You'll be hard pressed to fit 80 cells on your board and the weight will be hard to manage.

well if i use 4 10s2p packs in parallel... and do (basically) 10 cells wide and 4 in length... 2 high thats about 8" x 12" without a case... the new deck is 9.5" wide so plenty of space... i think each pack weighs about 2# so thats an additional 6# over stock... bringing the board from around 15 to 23 plus change....

although winter is up on us and will cramp some of my style... id say doing deliveries im getting something like 6-9mi per charge on the meepo... i think nothing less than a 6 is acceptable for business and pleasure in one day... maybe ill mold the case for 8p but start with 6 and see what happens =)

I'm doing 10s8p purely as a joke, it might be ridden for 1 charge. You need a mountainboard size deck and setup to have any benefit of a 10s8p pack.

The rating for voltage is all that matters.
4p, 6p, 22p don't matter thats just range.
 the esc already has amp limits so you won't gain any power...

meepo has kinda swappable batteries, just do that....

I bet you can fit them 10s8p under a normal longboard deck with my solderless modules. And thickness of the pack itself under 42mm :sunglasses: 

45-50 cells already possible under a classic ramp skateboard if you leave good space between trucks for the ESC etc.

I'm doing the simulation with my wife's drop deck I'll update the post in minutes. Length of the flat surface between drops is around 60cm available space, let's try it.

Edit : Maximum possible between 90-117 cells and you still have room for electronics (like 2x VESC6 w/ alu cases). Now that's with a drop deck (which would more be toward 90 cells due to low clearance on sides when carving). 

With a flat board like Landyatchz or else you can do the 110+ cells layouts I'm pretty convinced.

Edit 2 : Question is who needs this much on a street board?

some one planning on having a long day?? 

honestly tho... if a 2p gets me about 75min worth of delivery work about 6-9mi of range (guessing) and I work lunch and dinner shifts... i honestly need a 4p per shift to make the $$ before Id prefer to stop and charge... so an 8p could last me all day, both shifts and a ride home.. and carry my crappy light 2amp charger in case of emergency and keep the heavy ass speed charger at home...

No offense meant ; Your current 2p pack must have limited amount of Wh.

A conservative power consumption estimation on average street use is 10Wh = 1 mile.

A 10s4p pack of Samsung 30Q for example brings you +500Wh on full charge. That's 50 miles range on street setup. It is also capable of 80A continuous current. All for around 2.5kg only. 

Just saying that a 10s8p of these cells is worth 1kWh. That's 100 miles potentially, but that's also +5kg battery to carry inside buildings. Are you running around the city this much?

40x 30Q's is 432wh. You don't measure wh's from full charge since voltage varies, so you calculate using nominal voltage. A more realistic range estimate on that pack is 20-25 miles.

oh im not offended.. the meepo 2p is only 4.4ah... and these cheaper ebay packs are like probably closer to 4.2ah... im on a budget big time so the 30Q which i hear is like high capacity would be awesome for the same size... but not an option at this point =)

That's a huge consumption for street no? +20wh/ mile? MTB with tyres get around 40Wh in climbing abuse if I recall correctly. Unless lot of hills 10wh/mile should be closer to average no?

You should try a group buy if you can spare 100-110€. I feel you there it took me 3 years to get all the parts I wanted (plus some mistakes on the way)

Keep it up!

10wh/km is the widely accepted estimate, and pretty accurate from what I've seen and experienced.

ok...so a couple wiring Qs,

so i have an idea for a swappable eboard/ebike battery 
(although i probably should have a nice bike battery that mounts to the frame, for now itll be behind me in some sort of container)

1)So for the 8p battery I take the 4  male connectors... have 4 wires connect as 1 at the female, pos one side neg the other... does this work ok?

for the bike ill use 4 batteries (8p) ... for the board Ill use 3 (6p)
so wire gauge... Im sure the easy answer is the thicker the better, but I have 16ga on hand, and some 14ga some where.. will the 16 be fine??

2)do all the packs connected have to be the same brand? so if i used 2 ebay packs (lg) and the meepo pack (samsung) any issues?

now perhaps for a stupid newbie question, but i wanted to check voltage on the packs and multi meter isnt giving me 36-42 but a higher number... am i on the wrong setting or something?

no, remember... im gutting my meepo and using the same esc/motors until a later point... basically just adding a few more batteries in parallel for more capacity/range

Conservative is 25 Wh / mile.

Typical is 10 Wh / **km**.

10 Wh / mile is Evolve-level optimistic and ***never*** achievable in real-world conditions.

I typically get 18 Wh / mile

Ok my bad, I forgot it was per km (ironically my country's units are in km too).

You wanna build 4x10s4p / 2x10s8p / 10s16p / 160 cells ? Which type of board do you want to use ? How much clearance do you have available ? What is max length ? You got me curious.

@accrobrandon hit me a message if you upgrade to 18650 cells.

Wow that's no more a longboard, it's a looooooooongboard ! Paddle type right ? 

That's lot of available space in any case. I'm ironing my modules, maybe you could test them on your build ? I can do a quick calculation on what you may expect for your pack ? It is solid enough for riding under stress IMHO but I tweak millimeters. Must determine if the extra width is worth it or useless. First instead of using flat strips (ideal condition) I wired and tinned my own copper links (that's the worst, approx 0.5mm round diam and my skills suck so wiring is not regular at all). Still not bad.

I got its small brother done yesterday too.

Guys i have a meepo 1.5 and I want to upgrade the battery. I want to buy one of the same stock batteries that come with the meepo 1.5 for $20. and I want to connect them together so i can have double the range on my meepo 1.5

I need two batteries in one.

Will it work the same? Is charging the same? if both batteries are connected together??

work the same, yes

charging will take longer..could be double im not sure about that but bigger packs require more time to pump energy into... unless you buy a high amp charger... 

example: the meepo 1.5amp charger takes a few hours at empty... i got a 2amp from diyeboard as part of a new hub purchase which is noticeably a bit faster, but not amazingly fast...

and then...i also have a 5amp smart charger which is my fav... i can get a dead meepo battery full in like 90min... 

a 12ah in a couple hrs... and 16-18ah in 3hrs (all from about 20% capacity)

they say high amp charging reduces battery life but im ok with that... Im trying to ride and keep moving forward!!
