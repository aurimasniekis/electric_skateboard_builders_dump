Hey guys. Recently replaced one of the vesc x on my raptor 2. I downloaded the new foc app on my pc and accidentally downloaded the unity firmware and hardware onto the the vescs without thinking. The board no longer responds to the remote. Is there a way wipe them and to load the correct firmware back onto them?
