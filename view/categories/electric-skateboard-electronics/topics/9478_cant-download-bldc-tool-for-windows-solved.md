Hi, trying to download the BLDC tool from Jacobs site http://vesc.net.au/download-now/

But can't get it to download. Any one else having this problem? Or can point me in the right direction?

Update:  this seems to work: when i clicked on the older versions tab, and then clicked on parent directory

http://vesc.net.au/BLDC-TOOL/Windows/

@jacobbloy can you confirm this is the most current version?
