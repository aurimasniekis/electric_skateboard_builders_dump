So I'm wondering if it's possible to make my own power switch for my esk8 I know there are ones on the market but I feel they are quite pricey - for what they are. I understand there will be high current going through the switch so a fliny little rocker switch won't last 2 minutes. Anyone know if it's possible?

I wanted to do the same thing, but seems too much work. Eventually I ordered this one: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vedder-anti-spark-switches-for-sale-restock/15639/24

still needs some soldering, but much better and cheaper than other options.

You could learn what **mosfets** are, and how they work.
