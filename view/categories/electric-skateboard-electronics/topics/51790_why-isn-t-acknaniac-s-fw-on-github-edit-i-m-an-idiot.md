Edit: I wasn’t looking hard enough, [here it is.](https://github.com/Ackmaniac/bldc)

Hello,

I’ve spent a while looking the sources for Ackmaniac’a firmware and I can’t seem to find them.

Why it is not on Github? Are the sources available anywhere?

Thanks! :)

But that’s a dead repo, and I thought v3.1 was the latest?

Yeah I just noticed it's dead.  I have no idea where to get the 3.100 firmware then.  Maybe it's on bitbucket?

If you don't find it, you can always demand it straight from the publisher ( here @Ackmaniac ). 
Benjamin and I will have a look where it is published or if it is published according to the GPL.
The page where you download the executable software, or a notice inside the executable software has to state clearly where the sources can be found, or how you can get access to the sources. 
If you can't find that info, something is missing....
