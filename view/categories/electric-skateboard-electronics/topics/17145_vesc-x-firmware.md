I got yesterday the new VESC-X. I connected it today and also connected it to the BLDC tool from enertion. I see that it connects to the remote without a problem. But there it ends, no input to the motor. If I connect to the BLDC tool, it tells me that there is a firmware read failure.

Any chance that I got the VESC without a firmware? 

Tried it with Mac and Windows, no success.

Any tipps?

What's the LED boot sequence? Does it stay at blue?

Thanks for all the help. I got wonderful help from enertion support. Turned out that I used an USB cable which is only good for charging but does not have a data line. The board works well now
