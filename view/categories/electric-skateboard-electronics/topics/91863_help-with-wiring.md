I want to sit down and plan out how best to wire my project before actually doing it to best accommodate the wires/connectors/etc.

I'd love to ask for "everyone to help me do it", but I'm not _that_ lazy.  I'm just looking for suggestions on maybe software to help draw it out first, then maybe I can not feel like a tool when I post the design on here and ask you all for feedback.

Good luck man first builds are usually a mess so maybe just go for it and then later go make a 2.0

I'm going to re solder everything open focboxes change wires the whole deal,
I'd just know what to do now.

I use fusion 360 and eagle 2000 to model and wire my builds. Both are free, however eagle is strict on the free version.
