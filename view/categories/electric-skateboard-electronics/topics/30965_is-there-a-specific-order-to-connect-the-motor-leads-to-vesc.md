Sorry if this is a dumb question but I couldn't find this info anywhere. 

Does it matter which motor leads connect with the three vesc connectors?

Im talking about Motor1, Motor2, and Motor3 pads in the pic above

Nope. doesn't matter. If it's spinning the wrong way simply switch any 2 of the phase wires

Since you only have 3, it doesn't matter as Jinra said. Interestingly enough, 4-phase stepper motors (and motors with even more phases) need them in a specific order, but you can still turn the whole set around for reversing.
