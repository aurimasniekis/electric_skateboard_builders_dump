Can anyone help me with the settings? Iâ€™m using a Samsung 12s5p 30battery and haggy 6364 â€“ 190kv motors hereâ€™s a picture of the current settings and are there any other tips you can recommend?

For the motors you could do 100A discharge / 20A recharge on the batteries then 70A / 30A for each motor...but it's all subjective

For a 30Q you can do 20A / 4A per cell in a parallel pack but the motor power is a dependent on your set up, change the amps in so the motors don't get to hot to hold and the amps out so you can just barely stay on the board full brake
