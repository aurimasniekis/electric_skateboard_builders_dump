Could you possibly create a 18650 pack out of these? Don't need to weld on the batteries

Just a thought....anyone ever seen these?

I think high current/heat is not so good for magnets. I also wonder how much internal resistance there is in those plates.

They also don't seem that strong. How long until you started loosing connection on a bumpy road. There's probably similar but better performing products out there :)

What a nice guy even if you don't like his blocks he will still weld a battery pack up for you.

I wouldn't trust those magnets to be able to hold a continuous connection in bumpy terrain, also the increased series resistance and power losses.

I personally use my DIY car battery dual pulse short circuit tab welder. Like this one:
