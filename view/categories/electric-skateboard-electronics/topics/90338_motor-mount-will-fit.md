Hi, I am building a dual motor build, with two 6s batteries connected in series and a 6.6 flipsky dual Vesc. 
I am probably going to buy this kit with 218mm trucks, 110 really big wheels, 15mm belt and 63 motor.

But I don't know if the motor mount will fit with the hobbyking motor or should I get the torqueboards motor, or what motor is best for speed?

If you choose the 63mm motor mount option both will fit. They have the same bolt pattern. Just make sure the motors will fit on the truck (length). The sk3 is pretty long. I think they are around 85mm but double check that on the hk side. They both are the same kV so no difference in end speed. Sk3 is unsensored, tb is sensored

What does sensored and unsensored mean?

With hall sensors and without. If you use the sensors on the motor your start up is more smooth, especially if you start on a small hill. Without you might first push the board a bit till you can take off. As soon as the motors rotate in the direction you want to drive there is no big difference

So it is better with sensores?

i'm gonna help you a littlebit though. there's a cool function called search bar. you can use it to find topics you want to read about.
for example i typed in "what are sensors." the following topic was 2nd on the list, good luck.

Damn right - I'm a newbie here too but I read as much as I could before building my first board, the info is all here, you don't need to constantly choke up the forum with endless questions

My friend with the lack of research and knowledge displayed here you would be better off buying the complete torque boards kit.  Build it get familiar with the components and learn.  You will then have a greater understanding of what goes where without all the hassle.  Choose your own deck and away you go with some very informative how to tutorials.  Better than a prebuilt and will help you in this perilous journey while getting you a killer board that will out perform any thing on the market.  Good luck and easy with the flagging dude.  Not a great way to make friends.

People on here wanna help.

On the other hand you're going the diy route and that takes some effort on your part.

There's plenty of reliable motor mounts available.

All it takes is a little bit of reading to pick the right one for you.

There's no best really. 

One i would recommend are @Boardnamics mounts.
