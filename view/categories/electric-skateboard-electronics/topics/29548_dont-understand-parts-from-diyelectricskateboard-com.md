Hi guys,

So I just ordered a bunch of parts from  to build my electric skateboard (12s4p, dual 190kv 6355). 

The set came with some parts I really don't know what to do with, and their support is being extremely unresponsive to my questions and absolutely a pain to reach out to. I have tried consistently for days to get answers from them, and they rarely follow up and give me any info. 

I'm reaching my limit and am really frustrated, so any guidance from you guys would be really appreciated!

#1 

First: Here is my enclosure and battery.

These items came with some velcro strips, velcro bands, and a strange thin black tube. What are these for? (pics below). I assumed I just had to put the battery under the enclosure and screw the enclosure onto the deck...

This is what they sent me for a motor mount:

This is different from the picture they have online--And in addition they told me it could be tightened onto the mount, but I don't know how. Is there a way to tighten this mount, and if not should I use some kind of adhesive to make sure it stays tight on the trucks? (Also just FYI, there are holes on the sides of the mounting piece pic attached). (Also included a picture of the screws that came for the motor mount kit.)

#3

They sent me these 4 metal ring things, and I also have no clue what they do. I've never seen this before in skateboard assembly. This was included in a little bag called "Longboard accessories."

Thank you so much for any help you can give me, I really appreciate it.

Velcro is for securing the battery to the inside of the enclosure. Also useful for securing other stuff like the ESC and receiver.

The headless allen screws go into the motor clamp and the button head (or maybe black) screws attach the mount to the clamp.

The tube stuff is weather seal and you line the edge of your enclosure with it to create a water resistant seal.

As for the other screws, nuts, and rings.. not sure.

Velcro comes in handy securing things under the enclosure such as vesc(s), battery, etc. The tube looks like a seal for the enclosure. Kind of like weather stripping. The bolts are to put together the mount and clamp as well as the motor. Use the search function or just check out other builds on here if you're curious about the layout. Looks like you're on the way to a sweet build though.

I just bought that motor mount kit for my build! In that little baggie, there should be 4 grub screws for the caliber clamp (silver, short). The longer silver bolts are used to attach the pieces of metal (there should be nylon locking nuts in there as well. The rest should work!

btw use loctite blue for the grub screws! and btw the longboard accessories bag seems to be bearing spacers

The rings are bearing spacers that go in the wheel between the bearings and sit around the axle.

those are TKP (traditional king pin). You're using RKP (reverse king pin)

yeah haha, classic skatepark joke is to reverse someone's trucks around and then see 'em have trouble cruising :joy:

Looks like a great set of parts.
The velcro is probably to keep the battery and other electronics in place inside the enclosure. 
I thought the thin black tube is heat shrink  with is invaluable when soldering together the electronics or covering bullet connectors. But sounds like its a seal for the enclosure..
The set of screws look like they are quality. The small black set of 4 will be to attach the motor to the mount. The other bigger set of 4 bolts and nuts will be to join the mount together. The grub screws will be to hold the mount to the truck hanger which screw into the outside of the ring part of the mount. When you're happy with your setup, use locktite.
Tubes, bearing spacers..

This is one of those moments where they don't do there research and don't want to YouTube it, I have the motor clamp to trucks there's 4 bolts top ,left bottom, and right , you slide the clamp onto the trucks and then tighten the screws on each side till it's a snug fit I'd suggest to use a lot of threadlocker on everything that is a bolt and not going to come off motor clamp ,motor mount , motor screws

DUDEBRO!! 

read read read then read some more. It appears as though you don't skate and thought very little before throwing down the benjis. Read. spend more time and read here, endless sphere, instructables, watch videos then read some more. 

You have a crap ton of quality goods there and you'll learn that by reading. There are threads here for beginners read them.

READ READ READ READ READ and watch videos 

also welcome to the great world of e-skate- now get to reading

Love,
people that love e-skating and want you to read

Thanks so much for the help everyone! Yeah i spent too much time figuring out what parts to get and not what all of them do :/ 

Could you anyone help point me in the right direction as to how to use the weather proofing seal? I can't find a tutorial for how to do it..

I know this is all probably trivial info for you guys, so thanks for being patient with me and still answering my stuff. I'm super glad to have a community like this

Just do some searching around on the forum, search "build threads" and you'll find lots of people who detailed their builds so you can look at the setups for points of comparison.  For the weather sealing I'm not sure with this kit but basically it just gets wedged between the enclosure and the board so when you screw things down it gets clamped between the enclosure and the board to seal to stop any (much) water from getting through and keep the case from rattling against the board.

Good you posted pictures of the things that don't make sense to you though despite the lack of initial knowledge looks like people were able to clarify a lot of things here even outside of what was asked, but don't lean too much on the community, people here want to help but there's also a mountain of existing information just behind the search.

I agree with the reading and watching videos but there is so much info from different places it is hard to put everything together- at least it was for me when I started.  All the products that are being sold, especially if they are from someone selling multiple products should have instructions.  It is very easy to make a line drawing and label screws or at least a post it note saying "The instructions are on my website, click on the PDF next to the product"
