Hi
I use lipo for my board and
I found this on amazon. http://amzn.to/2fGoVKt I used to the old charger B6 DC lipo charger but power supply dies overtime and I had to replace couple. now I was looking second charder for all in one solution and found this. it does up to 6s lipo for $60cad. no addional supply required. 
it's seem's to be a good deal and I thought I'd share it if you live in canada thoðŸ¤‘<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/0/c02aefd69de34964e9f92f65f451b429ad918f2f.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/1/118059001106398cec219add32a0e22d7cc29fda.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Does it balance the cells and does it charge more than one battery at a time?

Hmm, it's a lot less here in the UK, unfortunately for you... Plus power bricks are cheap too...
