I've been toying with making my own remote after my bad experiences with commercial offerings.  I have everything worked out, but I would like your opinions on modes.

I'd like to have 3 modes in the remote.  A Beginner mode, that only goes up to, say, 1/3rd of the available power, a Standard mode that goes up to 2/3rds power and an Advanced mode that goes up to full power.

That's pretty straight forward.

What I'm wrestling with is braking.  It seems dangerous to only make 1/3rd of the braking power available to beginners, but equally I think 100% brakes would probably toss a beginner.

So I'm thinking that beginner mode should have 50% or 60% brake and both Standard and Advanced mode would have 100% brake.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
