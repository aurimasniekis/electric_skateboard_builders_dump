I got the Carvon VESC with Carvon motors because it was cheap and preprogrammed for my selected motor. But recently I have been having some doubts. I see that it only has one capacitor from the pictures (I haven't gotten it yet). Also, I have been reading that cheaper ones aren't good on this forum. When I get it, I plan on using FOC. Can it handle it? Thanks in advance!

Depending on the HW version. If they're using 4.12 , then there should be some revisions made that would allow FOC to be more reliable. 

Also, I wouldn't run long leads to the vesc with just a single cap. Try to keep them as short as possible.
