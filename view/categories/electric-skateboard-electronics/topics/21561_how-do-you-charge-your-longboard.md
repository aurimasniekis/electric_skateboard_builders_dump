Hello,
I'm just curious how people charge their longboards. For examples: Do you charge them by taking the battery/ies out and charging them externally or charging them through a plug on your board like any production electric longboard out there? If you do the later do you think you could enlighten me how you do it as I am curious and it will also make charging much easier.

Cheers,
Doug

P.S. I'll be running 2x 5s 5000mah batteries in series

Use a thing called BMS.

To the batteries, and the cell wires.

The battery monitor plugs directly into the battery and has balance leads going to each cell or parallel cells. This is a middle man between your battery and the ESC and other electronics. Some BMS's incorporate  their own switch so you don't have to unplug batteries when not in use. They also have overcharge and over discharge protection to further help keep your batteries safe. This allows you to have a single charge wire going in and all the cells will be balanced by the end of the charge cycle. Otherwise you will have to remove your LiPo cells and use a balance charger to make sure the cells stay balanced.

Read up on what BMS's are, they can be arranged to charge your setup through a simple one plug charging port and a laptop style charger. I use 2 MEB one plug charging setups for my board (2x 4s batteries in series) and they work great [link here](https://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/ez). That way it is one plug charging and you can balance charge every time using your regular hobby charger. You can see my diagram [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/195O4DXcDSLLYW2YiV5m6OA1Z2fsCO6ywJ2y-_ya_OXo/edit). Each set of balance ports and charge ports connect to one charging adaptor so I charge one battery and then the other.

Thanks! It took a hell of a long time to design everything and lay it out clearly lol. I must admit a BMS is the cleaner/simpler option though I didn't use one simply because it was cheaper to not make one and I honestly couldn't wrap my head around it fully.

[/quote]

A BMS will come with a balance harness with a 10s connector that matches it.  All you need is two 5s extensions.
You remove the male end, plug the female end into your battery balance connectors and wire the cut end to the balance harness from the BMS omitting the ground balance wire from each pack.
Note: Of course, wire the cut ends to the BMS harness first, then plug them into the battery packs.

So basically, the BMS will come with a 10s connector, I then need to take the balance connector cables from my batteries and put them into the 10s connector?

I read your thread which made it easier to understand with the pictures.

You could just cut the connectors off of your battery's balance wires and solder (or use crimp connectors) the wires to the balance harness that comes with the BMS.
I chose to use the JST extensions so that I could have a quick disconnect at the battery just to make it easier to maintain or replace individual packs if necessary.

Or much easier, cheaper, faster, and with a lot less space is using a bulk power supply and balance on the side. 
Something like a meanwell 48 volt adjustable supply and battery medic device plugged into balance wires

There's a 12s version designed that u can find on endless-sphere if u search for "dumb shunt". No 10s but if you know what you're doing you could use the schematic/diagram on es and make it surely.  I've been trying to get anyone to make the 12s version with a lower wattage than the es version and sell them to me.  Maybe you?  I use two of the 6s versions but they're too slow

@Dougieman1001

Does take a bit more care and involvement when charging but it's standard practice for a lot of diy ebikes.   without the bms I rely on the two low voltage cut offs on the vesc so I have the pack turn off when the cells average 3.6 and 3.5 final cut off.
Much cheaper and faster charging and the biggest plus for me is using a single plug.  I hate taking those little plugs apart.

Do you use the 2x 6S balancers (cell medic) while the pack is still connected in series as 12S?  How long does it usually take to balance?

P.S. That "dumb shunt" is pretty awesome!

I am using two 3s batteries in series, but the principles should be the same in that you can buy a 3s to 6s balance plug adapter which will allow you to charge the two batteries at the same time.

Yes I leave all cells connected in series and stick those medics on the side while charging or while not charging. they are slow. Hard to say how slow but honestly u could be all day. But then leaving them on all day isn't hard to do. There is a version that u can attach bulbs to and it does more watts but then it's back to complication with plugs so I never use it
The dumb shunt I think is pretty simple if u know electronics. If anyone would make a 12s ok wattage one with simple bulbs, or advise me on what parts to get, or we could get a little board made or something.  
I like to charge fast and using these and a 30$ switching regulated power supply you can charge at 400 watts at 50.4 volts or if you want you could charge at 1000 watts or more. Not limited. 

I wrote the dumb shunt guy and to have him (populate?) the board would be 100$. Too much.  Surely there's a mid ground between ten and a hundred that does mid-wattage. 30$ I'd like. Or if it were a beautiful design 50$.  Worth it and then some.

That board has a 6S zippy 8000mah battery and an early  hobbyking esc. The carbon box was made to accommodate 16000mah, but in practice i never needed that much so half the box is actually empty.
There is no BMS just a lipo alarm.

Hi, I got a 50.4V BMS. I have three 4s 5000mah batteries in series. Each one at 16.8v. I had an XLR charger and everything. I read up on how to wire my BMS. Didn't use it for discharge only for charging. My batteries didn't charger at all. I connected everything up like it should have been and nothing charger. The fuse on my charger was good but nothing was working. My batteries were basically shot and I had no way to charge them since the BMS wasn't working I cut the sensor wires off so I had no way to charge them. Basically out $100 for batteries. Any ideas what went wrong. Until I know what's wrong I'm not planning on trying a BMS again. I'll stick to opening the pack and charging the batteries separately with a parallel charging board.

ha ha tha's funny.  Youre right and that is confusing.   If you were to use a gas generator to spin a wheel and hook your board's wheel up to it, and then put on the brakes, then you could charge your batteries.  I wonder how it would go when they were full.  seems depending on your bms, and if it uses tiny resistors to balance, which is most likely, then you could way overcharge your cells if you weren't monitoring.   Is this a scheme not to buy a charger or am I way off in your confusing plan

For charging I have to split the 10s in 2 x 5s. And for this I have to pull a plug in the middle. The white ones are for balancing.
