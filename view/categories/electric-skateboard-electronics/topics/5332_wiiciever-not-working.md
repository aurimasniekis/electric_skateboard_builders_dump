Hey there,

My wiiciever ATmega328 burned out, so I replaced it with a new ATmega328 that I flashed the code onto.

However, although the nunchuck still syncs to the dongle, the wiiciever green LED blinks a bit on startup then stays constantly lit (only the green LED, the red one does nothing).

The ESC makes the beeps that an ESC is detected.

Does anyone know what could be going wrong?
