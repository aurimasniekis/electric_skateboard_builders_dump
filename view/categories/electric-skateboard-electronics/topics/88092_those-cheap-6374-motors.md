does anyone have experience with the motors that @dickho has for sale on his ebay store, they are super cheap but was wondering of they are a good alternative to a SK8 192kv 6374?? 

talking about these motors
https://www.ebay.com/itm/6354-6364-6374-6384-150-170-200-230-270KV-High-Efficiency-Brushless-motors/303074535503?hash=item4690a6684f:m:mUObW1iCo0TOBEwqaQQ1qXQ&frcectupt=true

any advice would be appreciated, especially if you have tested these motors.

I have the 6374 170kv version. Honestly haven't used it enough to give a long durability test and I don't have any other motors to compare it to. The drawbacks of it are the wires are pretty thin and the sensor connector doesn't match the pigtail I bought from  for use with their VESC. But otherwise it has enough torque to get up a little hill in my city and haven't had any overheating issues with the can or wires. Keep in mind the shaft is 10mm too.

10S lipo 5000mah 65-130C
With 15/40 gearing speed wasn't my goal, I've never hit full throttle but I mostly ride on campus where there's lots of people. I'm also still getting used to going faster than I can push

Yap!

So far I put 100+ miles lots off road very fun and motor doesn't get that hot at all. I'm not aggressive on my setup 25a per motor 6374 170kv sensored gearing 16/60. 25a per motor thats all I can handle too much torque carry my fat ass no problem 190lbs.

i actually ended up ordering one and have done around 50km on it, its the 6384 200kv, and its been flawless im running it as a single with 40 batt amps and 85 amps on the vesc, plenty of power, seems like a legit motor to me but more testing and miles will only tell.

I have some experiance witv the 6374 170kv version, used them for maybe 100km on my current project, worked great so far. Doesnt get hot at all and the power is definitly there. 

I put them on a street board and used my trampa electronic box to test them since i havent built the battery for the board nor gotten the damn unity from enertion, ran them at 40A battery and 70A motor on 12s 

I opened the motor up to compare it with a 6374 flipsky motor, from my modest eyes it appears the be solid, one thing to note is that the stator is a bit shorter than the flipsky, 4cm vs 4.5cm. The flipsky has a bit more weight to it. Kinda hard to tell though since the cables of them has different awg and length.

What is the typical current draw this motor pulls? What should I use as its limit?

I found they ran a hair better than my 6355 190kv maytech... But for my normal ride loop they ran hotter than my sealed maytechs... They dont compare to my 6374 maytechs I'm currently on but def on a budget board or non high power setup get the job done

80 is a safe limit, that is what dickho himself said

Not sure how the sensor wiring is on the 6384 motor..  black = ground and orange = 5V? Is this right?
