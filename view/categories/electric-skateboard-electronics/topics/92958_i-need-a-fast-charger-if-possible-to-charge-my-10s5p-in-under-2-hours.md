Assuming it's made of 30'qs which would equate to 15ah then get a 7a charger it should charge your pack just above 2 hours

Not all Barrel charger are the same. Check with the guy who build your pack what he would recommend the max charge current is for the pack.

Who build your pack? Someone from here? Your barrel plug need to be a special one to be able to charge even with 10a. Make sure that you have this kind of barrel plug!

Believe is not good enough üòÖ believe me, if it‚Äôs the wrong one you will melt your charge port with 12a or worst case short your pack.

Just use a xt60 as the charge port and cut off the end of u charger and solder a xt60 to it. It works fine and is way overkill. Also super cheap

They aren't really designed for plugging in and out constantly though.
