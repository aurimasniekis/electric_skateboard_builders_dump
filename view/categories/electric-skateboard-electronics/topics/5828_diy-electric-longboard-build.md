Hey @electriclongboard I would get 2 of the 3s packs, will be thinner to mount under the board and also if one of the cells go bad its easier/cheeper to just replace one of the packs and your good to go. You'll want to wire the two 3s packs in series to make a 6s pack. :slight_smile:

You would go 2x6S for 12S or 2x3S for 6S. The difference is power/voltage 44.4v 12S vs 22.2v 6S.

You would pick your motor + KV rating according to what you want your top speed to be at.

If you go 6S I'd go for a higher KV motor. Most 170-230KV, sometimes 245KV are used for 10S setups.
