I'd get something with a adjustable end of charge voltage, do some searches... by going to a 4.15v charge instead of a 4.2v you get better battery life and don't miss out on that much juice ;)

my thoughts: accucel mote watts means playing it safer.

Imax b6 better Reads on voltage IR etc.

I would have taken the Turnigy 80w one.  1.98A vs 3.1A charging current..

I bought this one, and very good price for the fact you can charge 2 batteries at once. ( right now charging 3 batteries at once atm ) used a 3s balance cable to convert to 6s
