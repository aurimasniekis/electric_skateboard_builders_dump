Currently @darkkevind has my pack but doesn’t have the time to finish it as soon as I’d like (not his fault) is there anyone else in the uk able to take on the job? I want it done asap 

The pack is made but one of the parallel groups was giving out 0 volts, I have the spare cells ready if they need to be changed, I’m not a battery guru so I don’t know what the exact issue is 

I’ll get in contact with Kevin and give more details on what needs to be done
Many thanks :slight_smile:
