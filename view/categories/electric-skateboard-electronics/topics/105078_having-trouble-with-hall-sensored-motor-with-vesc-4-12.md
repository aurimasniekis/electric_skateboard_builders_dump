So a little while ago my 6374 motor from torqueboards stopped working with the built in sensors. So I kinda assumed it was the cable going to the vesc because it had broke and I resoldered it. So after making a new one and now discovering that when I try to run the setup wizard on the vesc tool it gets to the part where its running a detection and it does that loud horrible noise then goes to spin up fast and disconects from the pc and fails the detection because it disconnected. The vesc works perfectly when not connected to the sensors. Please help.

You probably pulled too hard on it and something else came loose when the wire broke.  Check the sensors and ESC PCB for signs of loose pins
