I got Flipsky 6.6 dual VESC. Everything works well except temperature sensor. When I connect temperature sensor red LED blinks and in the motor detection VESC cannot detect temperature sensor. I don't think my connection is problematic I have checked many times. Problem could be related with type of temperature sensor but I am not sure. I would like to hear your suggestions.

Datasheet of temperature sensor:
