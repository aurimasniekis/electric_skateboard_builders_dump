It will fit. It's standard 4mm bullet connectors.

I think the VESC already has the latest firmware on it, but you still need to do motor detection and configure voltage cutoffs for your battery.

It won't fit, the motor uses 4mm bullets and that VESC is using 5.5mm bullets.

You're probably right.
@Gabriel_Robinson: disregard my answer and listen to Nick instead.

The KV of these motors may be too high for the Vesc ERPM limit but it will depend on what voltage you will be running.
If you get motors from the same supplier that your getting the Vesc from, you will have a better chance of it matching.
