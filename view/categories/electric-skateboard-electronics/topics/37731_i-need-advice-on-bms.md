I have an good offer for a Samsung 30q battery pack, but i am not sure about the build in BMS.
The supplier send me the spec. sheet so i would really appreciate if someone more knowledgeable than me could tell me if this BMS is suitable for esk8ting or not. 
This are the spec. sheets.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/6/0635bbf5ba6fc2dab9ff6222badf84c7a82f5b11.jpg" width="353" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/9/09bf2b0728215b12d3b7df39eb5e43cd3f523f54.jpg" width="353" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/d/fd470ae7ebc1e6ff046cd5073bccf8ae0a217267.jpg" width="552" height="499">

Assuming that it is not bypassed for discharge, The one thing you will need to make sure is that your Regen brake setting "Batt Min Current" is no more than -10a for single drive or -5a for dual drive since the max charge current of the bms is 10a.

If I remember correctly, this will affect braking power at higher speeds.

Hey Namasaki,
thank you so much for your help!
I already had given up on this thread.
I really have to read more of the content provided on this forum, sorry for my noob questions.
I still donÂ´t understand the whole concept of braking. My question is, even if my regen. braking is on the lower side will i have decent braking, or is regen. braking and braking tied together?
Thanks in advance!
