Yes, I did.

Extremely happy with it, however I sold my Never Suymmer Reaper yesterday before I was able to make all the tests I wanted to.

I'm building 3 more boards for friends and I'm looking for a good charger for their builds.

do you have a link for the power supply?  Is this one where you can adjust final voltage down from 42 volts?

This is the one I got, this is a 3A version, you can also find the 6A version. But only if you need high speed charging, which I don't think I really need

Ah ok - I thought you found a brick charger. Wife won't let that in the living room. 
She barely tolerates the boards in the corner

Yeah I'd have to agree with @scepterr here, your best, cheapest and fastest charging solution is going to be a DPS module with a PSU attached. I'd recommend the DPS5015 and maybe a 48V 10A PSU.

The most compact ,high power combo I could come up with is the 5005 with a 48v3a supply, allowing anything up to 10S @ up to 3A charging, a fan is also a must if you have a lid. The 5015 has an additional board which would fit in that box alone not including power supply üòê

Yes but considering that's a 10A supply, might as well go with the 15A module

This is the 48v3a I'm using, with the 5a module you're looking at like $45
