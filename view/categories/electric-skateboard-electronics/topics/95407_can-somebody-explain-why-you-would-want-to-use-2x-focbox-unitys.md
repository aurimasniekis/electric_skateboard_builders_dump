Like whats the point? I see dual focbox builds all the time that are 2wd (I know 4wd is a point for dual focboxes) but besides 4wd, whats the point of spening $600 when you could just spend $300 (*cough and still wait a year and a half*)

I think you're confusing focboxes and their dual &updated counterpart, the unity.

Yeah I think  your confused....

You need 2x focbox for 2wd or 1 unity for 2wd, also focbox's are no longer in production

**focbox unity** is _two motor controllers_ on one PCB, controlling 2 motors.

The **dual focbox** builds you see uses  _singular_ focboxes, the old version where it’s a single controller on a single pcb (hence 2/dual are needed, controlling 1 motor each).

Dual unities are only for 4wd builds.

Thank you all for sorting through my slightly out of line peanut brain

This makes a lot more sense now. On Enertions website it doesn't show the older Focboxes so I always assumed it was 2x Unities in those "Dual Focboxes" builds (since thats all I knew existed)

Thank you all for responding :)

No, they were dumb and discontinued their highest selling product (the single focbox) for the unity.

I guess you're kinda right.. They should've left the tab on their website but made it grayscale and said it was discontinued so at least I know wtf it is lol

I keep hoping they'll release a new single focbox.  But i don't think they will.  Was the only product i used from enertion.
