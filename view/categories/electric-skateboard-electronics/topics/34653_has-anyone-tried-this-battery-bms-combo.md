Hey Guys,

I was looking as making my own 10s1p lipo pack with a BesTech BMS but then I saw this: [Battery Combo](http://www.diyeboard.com/10s5p-11ah-lg-battery-power-kit-with-bmschargerenclosure-p-572.html)

Have any of you tried this?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Cory

Afaik, 10a discharge cells are used. Total discharge 50a.
Compared to the more modern cells that's half the discharge, but hey...it's cheap and will most likely be fine for a single drive. 

If their 2 in 1 esc is included, I would chuck it or sell it. Not a big fan of the reliability and braking.

Those are likely LG mf1 cells, they are ok,not great, at 10s5p they should be fine for average use, just don't expect to go blasting up long hills

Yeah I'm pretty sure they're mf1 cells. And voltage sag is severe under high load but gentle use is okay as you say.
