Hi! 
I'm currently building my first electric longboard. I have 12 Samsung 25R 18650 and plan on using them in a 6S2P setup. I don't want many cables hanging out of my board when charging, so I want to have all charging hardware on the board. I planned on using TP4056 Modules, one for each cell, but I don't know if that's possible.

I would suggest getting cheap charge only bms..

I've heard the tp4056 can be a little inaccurante and be out of balance (in terms of final charge voltage - termination voltage..)

so yeah, they can be incosistent between each other..

There was one more thing about the need to have seperate power supply for each module.. though you can try out if of this works for you, since you will need only 6 modules probably (I assume you will charge as 1s with each module)

This is from info what I read on Endless Sphere forum..
