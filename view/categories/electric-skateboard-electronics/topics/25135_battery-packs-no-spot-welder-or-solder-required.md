Anyone come across these before? http://vruzend.com/product/vruzend_basic_kit/
 
Looks like a pretty decent cheap way to make up a battery pack without buying a spot welder.

Yes we have seen it before. No one has tested it yet. Somebody's got to take one for the team.

i dont see how these work. there's no compression happening as the plastic bits on the top and bottom of the cell arent squeezed together.  theres a screw on the top and bottom but nothing between the plastic bits to clamp them together.

I have their kit but kind of stalled due to house move, I am somewhat customising as resistance is futile

I'm too scared to solder my batteries together and risk damaging Â£160 worth of them, so I'll probably be trying this over the summer, see how it works.

My main concern is that they can hold 50 batteries only. Fine for a 10s3p, but if you want to make a 10s6p, you won't be able to. Can these individual kits then be linked together?

Yeah I'm probably going to stick to the 10s3p pack :P just because otherwise price goes up and so does space. However @smurf did raise a good point that the 10s6p would have a longer life-span :)

They would indeed, but also double the price and space. Unfortunately with batteries there is always a trade off. :frowning:

I've been looking at these for a while. The biggest concern for most is if they can handle vibration over time. Especially harsh terrain. And the concern is for the nuts coming loose, not the batteries coming loose from the plastic holders. Only issue I have is that the company still doesn't have the strips available seperately...so custom sizes aren't really doable unless you buy a whole lot of their kits.
```

you can use thread lock on the nuts to keep them from vibrating loose.

```
The kit contains 50 plastic holders, so you can go up to 10S5P, which is already a decent size.
There are indeed in the kit plastic strap to ensure the cells don't come loose from the holders. I assume you can put as much as you want.
They are saying the system can handle vibrations, but they also suggest to add loctite of hot glue on the thread if you want to be completely safe.
One of the guys behind this company has made a lot of videos on batteries for e-bike (he is the one you can on the demonstration video on Youtube). He usually spot welds all his batteries. I assume that if he promotes this new system he is reasonably confident the result will be similar.
you probably have more vibrations on a Esk8 than on an E-bike, but if a battery is placed in a good enclosure I cannot see how you cannot manage to make it stable.
Happy to see the first test by a member.

I'm kind of interested, but would it be possible to connect them vertically, as in like this:

They don't show anything similar in their examples.

I think it's only possible if you bend the connecting plates in a V or U shape. The structure is made for batteries standing up with an horizontal perpendicular connection.

There is a comment on one of the videos from the creator talking about using them for electric skateboards. He mentioned that they are not rated high enough for an e board at the moment unless you use a large amount of cells in parallel to spread the load. He did say that they are in the process of developing a higher rated version for the future.

Plus like someone else mentioned the vibration from usage in a electric skateboard would just tear it apart. He recommends it for bikes because they have their own independent suspension system that basically dampens every vibration from the road.

The plastic in use has a slight amount of flex and the cells go in very snugly, I promise you I can not see them coming loose.

The recommendation to not exceed 50 cells is more due to the likelyhood of total pack weight strain on the joints, this can be fixed with a variety of methods.

And of course the stainless steel used in the connectors, bolts & contact tabs are not very current friendly it's true.

The problem with introducing threadlock is that you can make a barrier using 2 nuts locked together makes more sense?

And yes have seen a million stl files out there, I guess their IP is the bolting system in tandem with dovetails joining, making it fairly simple for... well even me to use.

Has it been done before? Well since I was asked fairly quickly by the Vruzend people who I was after making a post of two on their thread, in reality, <-> username on ES I think they are worried about imitation being the highest form of flattery...I told them my name, I am not a manufacturer of eStuff.

Probably if you search all the sites you will find that it is maybe an amalgamation of derivatives but in combination fairly effective and once you have a patent which I am pretty sure they have, then it doesn't matter if they got their idea off something else.

But yes you could download a stl of a 18650 cap and modify it to have a top caps with a small hole in it and add your own hardware, there's no escaping that fact. I just bough two of their kits which were fairly cheap but I would have paid more to not have the shitty steel in them which caused a couple of cuts on removal already in the 2 parallels I've made so far.

That dude Micah Toll is their US distributer, he is very social media savvy and well placed in the ebike market to market their product. And yes it is not a high power application (unless you modify like I am in the process of doing)

I replaced the SS metal spring contacts with 1mm silver plated beryillium-copper wire fashioned into springs, also the SS bolts/nuts were replaced with 3mm brass bolts/nuts with washers on either side of the cap. 12mm pure nickel for the parallel connections and 2mm silver plated copper for the series connections. I'll use a copper busbar on both terminal ends to complete

Sorry to reseruct... but i have the newest kit and its in now way useful... it keeps decompressing itself and needs to be compressed every few days and causes overvolt faults and makes the vest reset constantly to the point the board is unusable and the 1st couple times it bucked me off going 20+ mph (1st time i flew into a median any time after that i hit the ground running)

```
so when u build the pack u snap the end caps on the cells and u need to "compress" the pack, i use a couple short 2x4's and my vice (not hard or u will kill the cells or break the plastic) well, as you ride they slowly but surely work themselves loose and cause under/over voltage faults... im dealing with that issue now, this time it was over voltage faults

So you compress it like the video. Then it wiggles loose?

What about zip ties or glue to keep it from spreading?

Messy, Ik, but that's my vesc, bms, and battery there is 3 layers of foam to isolate all the components and even with those 3 layers to dampen shock it still wiggled itself lose

You could sandwich the cells between two sheets of plastic then zip tie the whole thing

I was thinking about that @E1Allen

1/2" acrylic

Yeah. You need to compress it and secure it.  Foam isn't going to stop the vibrations.  

1/2" thick?   If you have room for it.  Something thinner would probably be just as good.

Then ima go with my idea of leaving some over hang and bolting the plastic all the way around until I get a spot welder and a 12s bms... 10s just isn't doing it for me

Because it vibrates apart right?

Probably, it always dies really fast... and in a controlled environment (bench test) unloaded it's fine... it's run forever... as soon as it's under load is when everything goes wonky

Those 80c temps normal?  Or is that erroneous?

This is my 1st board and when I compress I get one good long(ish) ride out of it then every ride after that gets shorter and shorter... I'm about to say screw it and buy a spot welder (or find someone I  the states to make me a pack) and use my vape to discharge the cells to a uniform level and then build my pack and charge em up

@E1Allen i sandwiched the cells with 1/2" teflon and it works way bettery... i couldnt even run the battery down today
