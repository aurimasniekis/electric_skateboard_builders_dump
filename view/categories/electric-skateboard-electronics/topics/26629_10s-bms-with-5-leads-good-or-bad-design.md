Taking apart a failed 10s/ 36v battery from a Landwheel and this is BMS.

I build electric bikes and am family with BMS / PCM systems but I've never seen a BMS like this before. I should add that out of 6 batteries, 2 have failed. I've not had a chance to test the 2nd failure but the first indication on failure Â£1 was that they it charge. After poking around with a volt meter I found 3 x cells at ~1.2v. So my guess is that either the BMS is failing to cut off voltage or perhaps just the cells are low quality. 

Has anyone seen anything like this before?
