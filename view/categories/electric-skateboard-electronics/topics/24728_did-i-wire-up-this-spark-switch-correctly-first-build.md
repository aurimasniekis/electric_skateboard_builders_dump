Hello all,

first time wiring up the spark switch and I don't want to get it wrong as I really dont want to blow my new VESC 6.

on the left is the VESC and on the right is where the batteries are. ( 2 x 6s 16Ah ).

also it seems that the switch itself has off in the centre,  on towards the left, then a double on towards the right.  anyone got an idea what thats about?
