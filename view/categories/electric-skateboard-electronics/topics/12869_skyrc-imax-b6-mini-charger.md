Is this charger suitable for charging 4x 3s lipo packs using a balance board?
Does anyone have any experiance with this charger that is worth sharing?
Thanks!

That's the one I use. It will take a couple of hours to fully charge 4 5k mAh batteries at 4a.

It does the job and its cheap.  I've been using a couple of months with no issues.  Its not fast and I sometimes have the balance individual cells, but for the most part its a decent charger.  

There are better chargers out there but I was just getting into electric boards and was trying to save money where I could.
