Is it better to have long battery cables/ canbus wire or three long motor wires (putting the vescs together on one side vs one on each side of the battery)?

Definitely long motor wires.
A long batterie cable is more problematic.

If you use long motor wires you probably cannot use FOC.

I don't know exact what happens, but on FOC you will get problems. @elkick could explain or link his old post.
If you add more caps in the line it can be okay.
