 How do you interface? Show off your buttons, switches and ports!

Here's our Ollin FreeRide with dual programming ports, 5v usb, DC charge port and main power switch. Not seen is a hidden momentary switch for RX/binding purposes.

Looks really nice. Gives a very 'futuristic' / technological look ;) 

Placement also looks very sophisticated, nice that you spent time incorporating such 'system''
