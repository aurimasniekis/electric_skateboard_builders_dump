Hi there,
bit of background here: I'm supposed to show my build at a public fair. Therefore it needs to apply the rules on german streets and I need to limit the speed to 6kp/h, just for one night.

Using 90mm HUBs from torque (130KV) and a VESC with 4.12 HW and the VESC Tool to program.

Can I limit the speed by limiting the erprom? erprom is revolutions per minute * poles right?
```

```
Lower your max erpm limit in the vesc settings.
According to your gearing and wheelsize to 6km/h
```
