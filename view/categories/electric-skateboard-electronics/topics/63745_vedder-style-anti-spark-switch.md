Can these fail and cut power to the board, or do they only fail in the on position? I've seen people mostly talk about the switches getting stuck in the on position, not much talk about failing and opening the circuit.

Yes, just depends in when they fail.

I had 4 antispark breaks so far, they would always break on the ON position.
I hate antispark so much.

If I donâ€™t have a fuse on mine, can they fail from on to off?
