Dear friends,
I want to create a battery that is 10s. How many 18650's cells are needed? I do not have a spot welder. Is their any way to make a battery WITHOUT a spot welder? My goal is simple, I want to make a battery as cheaply as I can that is safe.

It's really not recommend to solder the batteries as it can damage them. Us the search function on the forum you'l find all the information you need. This topic has been covered throughly.

You can make a pack without a spot welder, but your iron needs to be Very hot to melt the solder as fast as possible so as little heat is transfered to the cell.

the minimum of cells for a 10s1p is 10.  so upgrade to 10s2p would be 20 ... and so forth.  

There are some very good resources on this forum, just search for it and youll be sorted.

you can use NESE packs. You can get them at [18650.lt](http://18650.lt)
I use them and no problem. There are also others who have made builds with these modules.

The cell count depends on how much cells you want to add in parallel.
10s x p cells = cells you need

I know 10s means I only need 10 cells, however I want to be able to ride my skateboard fast up hills. So I want to be able to supply enough power to go 35 mPh.

Yes that looks like a good option, but those configurations are so small. They are also not customizable. But, alas I wouldn't have to use a spot welder.

Because no any 18650 can output so much current that you can reach your required speed.

Yeah you'd have a 10S 36V nominal, with about 2.5Ah so you'd get about five miles assuming you can get going without sagging the cells to 0 volts.

The amp draw is the problem no single 18650 can supply the power needed in terms of amps, the watts delivered to the components is the voltage times amps, most cells will have something like 20A max discharge so you need them in parallel to deliver enough amps.  Also 2.5Ah is not a lot of capacity for range.

Look
Your 10s battery can max output 20-30a.
If you add cells in parallel the current they can output add up
2p 40-60a
3p 60-90a and so on
but for every p-group you need another 10 cells in series.
So a 10s4p would be 40cells 
Or 10packs in series which each 4cells in parallel

When you connect cells in series you increase voltage but the amps you can draw and the amp hours capacity can only be increased by putting more cells in parallel.

Those not too small, itâ€™s just one of the series packs. You need 10 of this packs to create your 10s battery you want to build.
Each pack connect the cells in parallel inside, not in series

Guys let him use the search function, spoon feeding him this info won't help him in the long run.

Making batteries is a serious matter and should not be attempted unless you have a basic understanding how they work and you clearly do not. 

Do your self a favor buy this book and read and study it as much as you can before you attempt to make a battery. These things have enough amps to kill you don't underestimate their power.

Yah fair point.  Regarding amps though we don't deal with high enough voltages for it to be a problem (unless you stab yourself with the probes your skin has pretty high resistance) except when it comes to vaporizing wires and blowing up cells if they over heat but agreed it's not something to just jump into without a good understanding of electricity.

Check here for safety tips 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/please-review-my-battery-pack-so-i-dont-make-a/70102?u=lrdesigns 

Its not really recommended to solder 18650's unless your very experienced, its much hard to do right then welding. 

For 10s most guys are using 10s5p so 50 cells. This gives good power and long range. 

Its much simpler to build a lipo pack if your just starting out. It can be done with no soldering if you have the right adapters.

He wasn't asking you a question, he was posting a thread that you should read through.

There is tons of information on here about building batteries. It seems like you need to learn about the batteries a bit more before trying to make one. Or there are alot of people on here that build them for the community.

They aren't difficult things to make, you just need to follow the right protocols to make sure you are building something that is reliable and safe.

Also, a 10s battery, you are going to be hard pressed to make one that truly will hit 35mph. You will ahve to play around with your gearing and motors at that point.

If you are trying to build a "cheap" board that hits 35 mph, I suggest you read through ALOT of build threads to see what other people are doing, you'll find very quickly that "cheap" and "over 30mph" do not go together very well.

you can buy batteries with tabs included, so you don't have soldered directly in the batteries,I build my pack in this way, but I don't recommend, because is too dangerous

i would reccomend you not doing this unless you are 100% sure that you know what you are doing, and that your doing it properly
battery is the heart of your build if you want a cheaper option go with lipos
but if you want a li ion pack that has its advantages i would do it properly, because if its not it can end in a ugly way

im happy to assist you with your pack, I make them as a service so i know what im doing
but if you decide to pay someone to do it im one option, a spot welder is essential and it itself if around 100$+shipping

use as much insulation as you can, especially on the positive tab and between the p groups!
Either some 3d printed plastic or fishpaper

If I am going to be using a combination of 18650 cells  iI would make it make the capacity of the battery to last longer.

Hey mate, I donâ€™t mean to be rude but at this point in time you are not ready to make a lithium ion battery. You need to know all of this stuff well before you start building. You also must know how to connect the cells safely, strongly and just correctly in general. Failure to do those things can lead to potentially catastrophic disasters, in order of not so bad to bad this is what might happen, cut yourself, you burn yourself, your batteries are ruined, your batteries smoke, they catch fire outside, they catch fire inside, your house gets burnt down, and worse of all every person in the house or building gets put at a sever risk when the battery is incorrectly built. 

So please do a lot more reading, Iâ€™m not saying you canâ€™t do it, Iâ€™m just saying you need to know how to do it right first

I know it might seem like everyone is being killjoys but comments like this are why people are suggesting you go with a simple lipo set up or do a lot more reading.

Parallel vs series =/= range vs discharge.

There are a lot of nice people on this forum that would be happy to help you. I think what everyone is saying is that it seems like you need to start from learning the basics, and there are already a bunch of good online resources to increase your knowledge of electricity rather than someone on this forum writing you a personal electronics curriculum.

I agree with you about what you are saying about parallel and series. You do have to know exactly what you are doing.
 I am probably not going to go with lipo's simply because it defeats the purpose of having a DIY electric skateboard. That is my opinion.

I have done research and am in the position to move forward. I have been on with this forum for the past 2 years. I think using soldering in battery packs is very messy. I think my best bet would be getting vruzend solder less battery pack. Simply because of the versatility that it provides. I can make whatever connections I want without it being dangerous and it's customizable.

In my time here people have always told me the same types of things "you don't know what your talking about. Your going to build a bomb. " I could not disagree more.

I do know what insulation is and I understand the danger of using a spot welder. I know how the spot welder works. I know what series is and parallel. As well as how to combine them.

Bruv. You have been asked, directed and damn near begged to do some research. This site is full of the answers to your question. Everyone else won't say this but it needs to be said. @mmaner if I'm out of line tell me...

You are clearly uneducated in battery building. If you had the littlest of knowledge in it, you would have known about if bms is needed or not. And I'm not going to tell you cause all you're going to do it come back and ask which one you should get. It's redundant as shit as to how many people come here and expect to be handed all their answers by the PROs. Yeah I said it ðŸ˜Ž Seriously. Do some damn research. Stop asking us the questions that can be answered by using that search bar. I'm not saying you are lazy, but you're going about it the lazy way.

Easier and better are 2 completely different things. Yes it is a lot easier to set up with Li Po's. Some people enjoy the art that an electric skateboard can do. You can still mess up when setting up Lithium Polymer batteries. Most people don't want to acquire the knowledge and time required to create battery. It is much simpler to just go out and buy some Li Po's, but their is no fun in that. Some people enjoy projects putting things together and such. 

I want to make a battery. Now for 90% of people that is not something that they want to do. Their are pros and con's to doing each method.
