I'm wondering what type of charging port I should use to connect to my BMS. I've seen people use XLR, DC power plugs, and Aviation connectors. I want something durable and waterproof though. Any suggestions?

There are many options available. The most important thing is that it matches your charger. Which, where ever you buy the charger most likely has the matching female port.

If you care about cell longevity, slow charging is the way to go. Otherwise you can find tons of chargers on eBay, aliexpress, etc. Search your pack's nominal voltage and look for chargers that have 4a+
