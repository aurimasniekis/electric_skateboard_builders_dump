Information.
Benchwheel dual 1800w motors Battry 6s4p and it has a ESC/BMS Combo.
I used this board on a daily basis for 6months..
off train boarding in rain I took it evrywhere.,.
its stil working awesome.. only prob is battry life decreased a little and the motor power after the battry gets low.
now im on a bugged cant spend alot.. I was thinking about extending the old battry with a E bike battry..
the E bike battry can be plug in on top of board and I can charge it separately, battry comes with own charger.. 
i dont know alot about ESC/BMS Battry Amps Volts risk
Is my idea possible ?
if yes what kind of septup battry do i need what volts shud it have?

```
seriously though. that battery is no good.
why not just parallel up some more 6S batteries? wack a 10,000mah 6S lipo in parallel and you'll go for miles.
and it'll only cost you $100
