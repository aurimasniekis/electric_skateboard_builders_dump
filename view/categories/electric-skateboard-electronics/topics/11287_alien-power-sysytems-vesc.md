Hi there, has anyone had experience with VESC from Alien Power Systems? Just wondering as they seem like a good source for the Vesc in the UK.

Not so easy for average people as you'll need a programmer chip as far as I know.

I really hope they're not shipping without base firmware. As long as they've been flashed once they can be updated by USB like any other vesc.

They list may tech and flyer so just the same vescs from China like https://m.alibaba.com/product/60541369416/New-type12s-50A-VESC-with-heat.html?spm=a2706.7843299.1998817009.37.4sWTRW

So in that case I'd look at this one with the redesign and heatsink. I know someone on here is using it already but didn't know the source...

just looked some things up and it looks like with a "ST Link V2", it think its called, you can flash the vesc, a guy on youtube does it using this method, here is the link.

which is exactly what I was talking about. You'll need the programmer and can then upload the firmware.
Problem with this is not just the added hassle to upload via the programmer but also the fact that the seller does not need to give you any warranty with the VESC. As soon as you use it the warranty is voided since he sold it without a working firmware and any change that you made (uploading, changing settings, using it on a skateboard) voids the warranty.

damm, well that's disappointing, do you think you could link me a EU or UK source for a VESC with firmware loaded?

@geohan @Maxid Since they are shipping without firmware, that means that they can't test them prior to shipping. So if there are any electrical/hardware errors (shorted spots or bad connections) you're going to fry the VESC when you first power it up. The testing that our known vendors do goes a long way to ensure that you're getting a VESC without hardware defects.

Also, on their site you have to select either a "Maytech" or "Flyer" option... which suggests that Alien is just buying and reselling the parts from those two manufacturers.

With no testing, seemingly no value-add, and no cost-savings, I wouldn't buy a VESC this way. I would buy one from one of the known brands here on the forum, or at least directly from Maytech or Flyer directly via EBay or AE.

has been mentioned before:
http://www.esk8.de/shop/#!/VESC-V4-11-12-made-in-Germany/p/56097898/category=15255004

Comes with everything you´ll need.
If you have any problem with it, they´ll help you out. They produce it in Germany and donate to Vedder for every VESC they sell.

you´re talking about Alien I think?
Like the others mentioned before, if you want to order from them, prepare to upload firmware and everything

Worth checking with @onloop whether the European warehouse is in operation. I ordered mine from the enertion site and it did eventually come (to the UK) from Belgium.

Also the price @ esk8.de is slightly lower than enertion's with 1yr replacement warranty but the main differences are that €169 VESC from esk8.de gives you standard 2 years EU warranty that applies to manufacturing faults while enertion's €180 VESC with 1 year replacement warranty gives you two(need @onloop here) "no questions asked" replacements during that period. Hard choice considering that you could as well not buy that warranty from enertion and pay €81.79 with €13.28 shipping which makes it roughly €95. However if you want to buy two VESCs consider buying two from enertion with warranty for one at a price of €275 vs €338 + shipping from esk8.de. Possibility that you'd fry both VESCs are pretty low I guess but this is based on onloop's alleged 3% failure rate which probably counts in people that bought VESCs without warranty as well.

edit: "no questions esked" to "no questions asked"
