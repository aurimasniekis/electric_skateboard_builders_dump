I would like to see how he wired these, because it sound very odd. You need some kind of electric controller between motor and battery.

ok so the motor is seperate he controlls the motor trough the servo and the pwm signal goes to the remote 

the motor is a little bit special because you cant get to the software or anyithing 

is it possible to pramm the servo trough the pwm to do what i want ?
