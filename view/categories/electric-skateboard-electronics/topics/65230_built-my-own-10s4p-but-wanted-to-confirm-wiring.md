Hey guys! Glad i'm back to e-skate again as I have just put together my DIY and wanted to show others my pack's wiring. I'm not sure about the BMS's ![20180817_183034|375x500](upload://twpGUaH11cRBhxPB0A0kDA9Dcu1.jpg)![20180817_183051|375x500](upload://uLH5KoZPOysAGpcZktqKcKTIer3.jpg)P- which I think it's to discharge which I'm bypassing. Only using it to charge. I do NOT like this BMS as it charged my pack up to 4.25V for which I disconnected and quickly slow discharged it back to 41.1V. Everything seems to be working as I just need to mounted. I enjoyed building my own packs VERY MUCH with the spot welder. Thanks in advance.
