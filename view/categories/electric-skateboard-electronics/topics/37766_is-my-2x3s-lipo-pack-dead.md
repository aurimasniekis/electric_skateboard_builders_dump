Time to recycle and buy new ones? They are maybe 1.5 years old and maybe charged 30 times or so.

Switch on the multimeter to the position "200", then you'll see that you have 21.9V :grin:

Hm I tried that also... but maybe it could be something with the multimeter. Anyway the VESC is dead/no diods is glowing. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/c/6c90d461577da102a7a3d4a226a6e7349d4f3f82.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Hmmm.... that's strange, I'm afraid the lipos are dead. 
Did you forget to switch off or unplug your board?
That happened to me, my 10s Lipo had 9V but the vescs diods still glowed :laughing:

Yes the board has been on for weeks... Maybe not so good! I don’t have a switch for it, but a ”anti-spark-keychain” that I left attached in the board. Well well... now I have the opportunity to change from LiPo som something safer. : )

Yep. dispose them off proper and safely.  2v isn't a good value even for a single cell. Even worst for a bunch of the in series
