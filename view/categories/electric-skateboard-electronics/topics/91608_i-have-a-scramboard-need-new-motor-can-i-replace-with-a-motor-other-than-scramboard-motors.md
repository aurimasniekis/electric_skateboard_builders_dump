What are the specs of the board you bought from them?

Actually havenâ€™t been to their site in years 

Which board, hub motors?

getting closer, but you're going to have to help a bit more in terms of the exact spec you have

I googled this in 5s
https://www.scramboards.com/scramboards/scramboard-vertigo-edition-army.html

Even on 10s 270kv sounds way, way high and no torque. Can you share what it was like when it worked and how you deduced that the motors are the problem?

Yes if it looks like the board in the link, replacement motors are not a problem

![image|305x229](upload://m0SQZUkbCUaxes2749WwI8q94Px.jpeg)

_**Brushless Outrunner Motor power**  =  63 mm size. 3500 watts, 4N.M, 250 KV_

Opportunity to give the board some balls

Yes thats kinda the issue theyre on 10s4p batteries they say theyr 60mm 250kv.....kinda low on torque...i was asking cuz i want more torque maybe like 180...200kv.....i have researched
 thats sounds like its where it should be for me being around 190lbs.

I'd leave that at 10s if you're going to keep the old ESC controllers

proabably a pair of these
https:///products/electric-skateboard-motor-6380-170kv

You should measure the shaft diameter to make sure it fits the motor pulleys you have (although they sell those too on that site) and you may have to cut the shaft to stop it poking into the tire

For more fun upgrade the battery/escs

10s4p batteries they say theyr 60mm 250kv
[/quote]

why, I mean why would anyone do that?  you will never see the sped that 250kv motors can deliver at 10s4p.  There is literally no upside that I can see, its just sacrificing torque for no reason.

Makes you wonder at the knowledge of the vendor if such a fundamental mistake can be made on the motors.  The rest of the thing looks good though but I'm guessing theres an ali express special dual or pair of vescs in there.

@Jcammarata4
My friend you can put whatever motors you want on there but do some reading here first.  There are a multitude of motor threads but be advised, you need to spend to get quality.
Look up Maytech/Hobbyking/Aps and indeed Trampa.  
 Keep the kv to 170 or below and that board will tear the soles off your shoes.  It will be a completely different animal entirely.

You can look up some aliexpress / bangood (racerstar) motors.. Though they will cost in 60-70 usd range at least, higher level stuff costs probably +80 usd..

Are u EU or US located?

Though what you really need to figure out is hole spacing, some motors might have different layout, though it might be 60' size motors share the same pattern more or less and more fiddly were the 50' size. 

+ you need the right diameter axle, most come in 8mm, but just make sure it is same.

Don't run those escs @12s. They used a fragile 4.1x design(Maytech v1 I think)  which will almost certainly go bang running 12s.  Keep those escs @10s. Get new motors 170kv or lower

When bored come back and get newer escs and a fresher 12s battery
