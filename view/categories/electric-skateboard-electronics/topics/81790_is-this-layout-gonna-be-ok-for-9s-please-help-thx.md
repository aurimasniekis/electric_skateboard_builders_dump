So i know theres alot of connectors. But that im ok with. It is the length of the wiring that im not sure of. Does anyone see a problem here? They will be 3s lipos...

Im thinking about putting a fuse on there too. Can anyone recommend a fuse? 40-45A i suppose?

Looks good. But if you have the means to do it, shorten those wires. It will help out greatly with space.

I think particularly the concern is the space between 1 of the 3 lipos is bigger... not by much but it passes thru the connector as well. ?

Now I see what you're asking. You're still good though. That distance isn't going to cause anything to worry about. Wire her up and ride.

@Nedtrampz For the fuse, the value depends on your battery and your ESC's settings and specs

Ofcoarse it does friend but that doesnt answer my question.. Thats why i said i want one between 40-45A..

Im running my power thru xt60's which only have a max of 60Amps. My esc max is 50A and my battery pushes 35A so 40-45 fuse is what i want. 

Any ideas

Depending on the kind of fuse you will get, I'd say 45A or 50A (some fuses are faster to cut current than others)
