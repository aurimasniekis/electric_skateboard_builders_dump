$250 for a dual vesc 4.12? Can't you get 2 maytech singles for like $200? I guess you get an anti-spark but who knows if it's any good...

i honestly don't get this dual vesc hype. like yeah it's cool and you don't need a canbus cable but if you fry one side of the board, you have to replace the whole board. rather than disconnecting the dud and replacing it. ik ik you can run it as a single driver only but like why? i get why people do have em but the form factor is really just a tiny bit bigger for 2 escs like eh? yall get me? ðŸ˜‚

It looks like they literally took 2x 4,12 and stick them together. Not even bothered to change PCB layout?
