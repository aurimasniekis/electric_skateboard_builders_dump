So 2 questions 
1 Im going with 8s2p lipo pack and going to buy bms from Battery support ( if any one has better at A afordable price please share) but I wounder if i should go 45A or 60A since I dont want to mess with bypassing, seems to difficult 

2 I want a percentage checker and there are cheap on eBay. But they have a very Liw voltage but does that matter or do I have to get one that supports 8s?

But the currykryddning does not fully go through it, it just sonders onto the man cables?

If you have room for a larger BMS, go with 60a or higher.
The higher the amp rating on your BMS, the more robust it will be and you won't have to worry about it overheating.
