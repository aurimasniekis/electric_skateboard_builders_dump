I can’t find a decent step down for my build. The one I got is only rated to 36v. I need it to be able to power my el wire, fans, and led on my power switch all at once. The one I got would work for that but I don’t think it will handle 12s. Does anyone have any suggestions for a step down. I do not want to have a separate battery.
