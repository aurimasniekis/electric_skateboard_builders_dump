Hi,
I'm using this calculator to find out what to get for my skateboard.

http://calc.esk8.today/

I was thinking of using 2 x [ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 3S1P 20C](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-3s1p-20c.html)

Do I just call it  ?

10000mAh-6s-40c


And I'm not sure about the meaning of.

Cont. Discharge

Max Discharge 

Charge per cell


Thank you! :-)

Wiring them in series would be 6s 5,000mah 

Wiring them in parallel would be 3s 10000mah

At battery spec there is info as:

Discharge: 20C Constant / 30C Burst

Constant = Cont. discharge. It means how much current the battery can output continiusly
Burst = Max Discharge. This one is max amount of current you can get for a short time from the battery.

Also if you want to check max current rather than C rating, its calculated as (C Rating) * (Battery Capacity)
So 20*5(Ah) = 100A cont.

I'm running a 

[Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-190kv Brushless Outrunner Motor](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-190kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html)

What would you suggest I should do ?

12s setup with that motor kv.
[/quote]

So running four of them in a series ? :-O 

Or can you suggest any other batteries?

I only need to go about 30 km/h (18 m/h )

The battery depends on the ESC you willl use. Generally higher voltage means less current draw from battery so lower temperature and better performance overall.

You can use calc.esk8.today for general calculations. 

BTW i'm no where near expert on these, still planning to build my own board. But i'am familiar with the electronics from the RC cars.
