So I'm making a couple packs for the first time (10s4p 30q's) on a pair of evolve boards and im having the hardest time visualizing how the balance wires get put on the battery. My cells are oriented in the S shape pattern to account for flex so I think I over thought the difference between the way the lipos were arranged and I've lost the meaning of it all. Can anyone here provide me with a visual representation along with a method to the madness? 

PS: First post! been a creeper for a long time, lol.
