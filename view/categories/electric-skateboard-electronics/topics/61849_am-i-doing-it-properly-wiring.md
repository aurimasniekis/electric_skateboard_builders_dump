Hi. I just wanted sb to confirm that I am doing it OK because I am not sure about it and I do not want to burn my house :D

left corner - focboxes; XT60 to XT 90 adapters
 in the middle - parallel adapter, loop key, parallel adapter
right side - 2x power supplies (2x 10s 8Ah) that will give me 16Ah 10s

looks okay to me. a lot of people (myself included) put the loop key on the positive wire, but it apparently doesn't matter is what I've read. and make sure to use the xt90s bit with the green pain as the key since that is where the resistor is. (looks like youve done that already)
