I recently built a diy board and charged up a 3200mah 3s 11.1v battery and went to test the motor for the first time, and the motor did a couple rotations then spun out. I was using a on off switch from  that fed into a vesc then a 190kv motor. Anyone know the problem?

Did you run detection and configure the VESC parameters? Post BLDC tool pics please.

Whichever connects, haven't you done this before?

The VESC is a sensitive device for which you shouldn't just slap it on a build and use without configuring it reading the do's and don'ts first. Please check this out before trying to use the VESC
