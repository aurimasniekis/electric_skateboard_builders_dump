Hi I've put together this for my charging system. I have two 3S batteries that are wired in series and connected to a 6S BMS. A previous setup I had charged Battery 2 to 12.4V and Battery 1 to 11.6V. IF someone could let me know if what's wired so far is correct and how to connect the balance cables. The BMS has 7 leads as labelled on this diagram and confuses me. 
Thanks Heaps
