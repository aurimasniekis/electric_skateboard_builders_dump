So a couple days ago my board has decided to brake randomly but only one motor so I thought it was bad insulation on the phase wires. I tried starting it up off the ground and one motor would turn the other one was cogging and then sparks flew out of it. I imminently shut it off and pulled the motor apart. ![1568474510892783757162877652407|243x500](upload://iWq0WiwSIAQ5zV3vRFR4iw3a0h8.jpeg) ![1568474532369887234725973440316|243x500](upload://txFqPlbR3UzBQ6WQG5tV343Vzzu.jpeg) ![15684745463874248239258270167793|690x335](upload://fICHBCOO5MgpAeodcjUkVqHXnHf.jpeg) ![15684745634884654740369392620369|243x500](upload://4sKwAFSWcHudoBytaW1OpNlXN4M.jpeg) ![15684745803156330720240969793016|690x335](upload://rLfbjQezBWu8Uqc8bf0MM0c6vwk.jpeg)

Have you tried sensorless?  I had a similar issue with sparks due to an issues somewhere in my sensors but run them sensorless fine

Ahh they’re some cheap Chinese hubs I’m not actually sure where they’re from - extra second-hand from another member
