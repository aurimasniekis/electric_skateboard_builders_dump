Hi all, 
sorry if this is the wrong place but looking for some help/advice in trying to set up for video logging. 
Having done the easy part of putting together an e-board with vedders fantastic ESC, I now feel the need to log data to my laptop to ensure its running correctly. I feel it'd be far more useful to log data in a manner that i can look back on after riding rather than having to examine it while riding. 
So I've been trying to set up the open source video logging. 

So despite zero experience in Linux & programming, so far I've set up a virtual machine running ubuntu, and following the read me instructions installed the dependencies and openSV but as electronics is just a basic hobby of mine the instructions compile, qmake and make are a little too vague to work with. (I have spent a good few hours trying before looking for help)
I'd appreciate any help like pointing out what I need to do to compile it correctly.
Thanks

```
Maybe just buy an HM10 Module and use the Vesc Monitor app from @Ackmaniac

That solution will work out of the box ;)
