There are numerous threads on BMS's. Use the search function and spend some time reading the threads.

Good luck with your build :slight_smile:
Cheers

see:

essentially they make all the different battery packs "look" like one big battery, keeps everything nice and balanced for easy charging and easy/safe discharging when you're motoring around
