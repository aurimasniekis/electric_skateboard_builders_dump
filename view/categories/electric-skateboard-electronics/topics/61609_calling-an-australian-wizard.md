Hey esk8 fam, just a quick thread asking are there any vesc wizards based in Australia capable of repairing 2 focboxes with suspected canbus issues?

Already consulted the drv wizard and its just not feasible to send to canada and back so is there anyone out there?

I've always found it a bit ironic that we have Evolve, Enertion, and BajaBoard here yet don't have any local DIY store options/battery builders/people to fix our broken VESCs.

Sorry I can't be of more help.

Local esk8 business has been discussed a few times now, but to my knowledge no one is running one yet. The one job I have right now seems to be more than enough for what spare time I have...

Based in Melbourne, northern suburbs.

Same,  just busy as.  Esk8 seems to be real popular in melbourne, not so much up in Queensland as yet.
