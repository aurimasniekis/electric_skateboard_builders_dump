**This will void your warranty! don't do it unless you are totally confident in your ability to fix your own problems!**

I did it *with Jason's permission* when we were troubleshooting my dead space cell. It was just loose balancing plug wire in the end; nothing major. 

once you cut off the shrink wrap, and you will find the battery wrapped in the plasticky yellow material (literally have no clue what it is...) With tape running along the sides. 

The material is think and easy to cut, so when you are cutting off the shrink wrap you have to be careful not to cut to deep...

After you get off both layers of protection, and take out some foam from around the bms, you have a completely open battery. 

Again, don't be stupid by opening your battery, and then crying to Jason about it... just because I made this thread, **does not** make me responsible for you whatever you do to your battery.

In the pic above you can see the yellow stuff surrounding the battery- maybe someone knows what it might be... (I already took off the shrink wrap)

undo the screws, and you can see the BMS. **don't f*ing do it if you don't need to!!!!!!!!**

Again, don't take apart your $300 battery just for the hell of it- this thread idea was brought to my attention by someone (I said I was going to do it a long time ago, but just forgot) but I will delete it if people aren't getting the right message...

It is like when ifixit tears down an iPhone in a youtube video: they aren't telling you to do that to your iphone, but they are letting you know how it's done and what could possily be a weak point. *Just don't abuse this knowledge or it'll go away...*

(but let's be honest though: I'm pretty sure BlackBerries are the way to go- like no joke, blackberry makes some damn good phones now in days despite people thinking they are dead. All the pics you ever see me post were taken on my BlackBerry...sorry for the side rant #BlackBerryMasterRace)

Back to the task at hand: If your space cell has a problem, talk to Jason **FIRS**T, and then, if he wants you to open it up, you do that after you have his permission... saying your battery broke **AFTER** you opened it up will get you no where....

Nice write up! I obviously voided my warranty haha. I already took mine apart and mounted my volt meter,power switch and charging port to the psychotiller 21 inch enclosure. The space cell is already pretty tight fit so i had to mount on the sides of the bigger part of the enclosure on the front. Also had to extend all the wire a bit to reach. I dont mind paying for a new one if my handy work fails though. I am honestly having so much fun building this thing i think i will be sad when i finish it!

after all that BMS talk the other day, im really curious to know how the SPACE cell BMS is hooked up. I can almost make it out from your photos, but I can see the charge port. (I assume the deans is the ESC power connection?)

a red wire from the other side of the pack goes to the charge port and the ground from the bms. another smaller power wire is also connected to the charge port that goes directly to the lcd display. if that helps
i am assuming he changed his to a deans because mine is a xt60. also has a fuse right before there that i dont see on his.

For some odd reason this thread makes me feel a bit weird.... its like you have snatched my baby, gutted it, now are sending me photos of its innards, like some sick ransom-kidnap-gone-wrong scene from a snuff movie.... :scream:

Fortunately, I have a new baby on the way 10S4P - 50A CONT BMS - NEW SWITCH - BUILT IN FUSE... it's also in a shiny-black shock resistant ABS (tamper proof case) so people don't disembowel-it & send torture pics of it to me.

an abs case on the battery pack would eliminate the need to include it in the electronics enclosure making a split layout ideal. On the new version, where will the switch, power, and volt meters be located? Any chance they could be on the side of the pack?

edit: looking at that BMS in this picture set it seems like it could support up to 15S. There are 5 more balance lead solder points just waiting. I can't help but feel like somebody's going to try and stack in another 5 cell groups eventually.

## \#17 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2015-11-20T23:40:54.382Z Reads: 389

```
the on/off, charge port, LCD display will be facing upwards (or downwards if you desire) on the new pack.

Personally I think anything on the bottom of a deck is a bad idea as no matter where you locate it, say the side for instance, it is still exposed to dirt, dust & blood & bone from rolling over and mincing tiny dogs.

If the components are upwards facing it is much less likely they will get damaged from blunt force impacts, of course if you ride in the rain water can still seep into the upwards facing parts, but that would happen if they were on the bottom also.

The NEW ABS Hard case will have a ip68 rated on/off switch and the LCD screen will be sealed to the case with silicone to help prevent moisture ingress. The charge port has a flush mounted rubber cap integrated into the case to seal the hole to help prevent moisture ingress.

having the volt meter on top is brilliant, but in my experience in Florida weather, you don't want the power switch to be in a position where it can't immediatey drain. If i put the switch on top of my decks where i live they would collect mud and water. But even when allowed to drain, they eventually stop working correctly. 

which is why i'm looking for a membrane type click switch that is inherently waterproof. 

I'm also experimenting with key switches, but the ones i found to try out seem pretty cheap. They're still worth testing though.

Hi, I'm going for my first build on a penny board. The idea is to have an e-board small enough to casually bring on trains and buses. I bought a SPACE cell v2 without realizing it's too big to fit on a penny board, and I'm thinking of opening it up and removing some batteries to make it smaller by sacrificing some power. Any advice? I'll try to get some professional help at makerspaces/prototyping labs, but we all know the most professional help is on here :smile:

nunchuck accidental squeeze , and its went blindly BALLASTIC . got ran over by several cars . just sent it to a3rd year engrg student whom promises to patch it back while studying the components . 
after examining , he concluded that only lcd display needed changing . all other components are intact . except a few wires needed soldering and some spot welding .

Wow! It's amazing that it still works!.. if a lipo got run over by a car you need to dispose of it ASAP as it would be an iminent fire risk.  SPACE cell just needs some new parts and it's good to go again :smiley: ! This is likely due to the ABS cell holders that would have prevented the cells from being damaged.

i have a waterlogged space cell on my bench right now that needs a new BMS and "fuel gauge" display. This gives me hope that i can restore it. I have a replacement coming but i'd still like to get the old one working again. The cells seem fine, but the BMS needs to be replaced or maybe just cleaned up, i'll have to play with it more. The display though is missing segments.

@longhairedboy I went for a simple run to the store and got caught in the rain last week. I got super paranoid, came home, took everything apart, wiped down and put a blow dryer to it. I can probably do a better job with weatherstripping the sides but the rain took me by surprise. Luckily it wasn't too bad. Was it a significant amount of water that got into the Space Cell? I'm assuming any amount of water is too much.

Iso alcohol is your friend when dealing with water on components. It does a great job of displacing the water and evaporating. Often times water will leave conductive residue and the alcohol helps to prevent that.

Yeah the wheels threw enough water at the tiny micro-crevice between the box and the gasket to get in there and start being absorbed by the space cell's papery packing material as well as the foam. I understand what went wrong and i'm pretty sure i can prevent this from ever happening again. 

Luckily the way i laid things out nothing else got damaged, both VESCs are ok and the only issues are with the space cell's components. The 18650s are fine, but the BMS is acting funny and the voltage display is missing segments. The switch is questionable, but i've removed it and the pack is still powered on even when the switch circuit is open. At the moment the cells are disconnected from the BMS to prevent anything else from going wrong. 

I'm going to tear down the BMS and go at it with some alcohol and a brush, then find a replacement for the fuel guage. I also ordered a replacement space cell, but that won't be here for another month and it would be nice to have two of them working. I still have a single drive scarlet prototype to build and i'm about out of cash.

Thought I'd share some pictures of my SPACE cell from a Raptor order... It looks a bit different. Most notable is the BMS difference... It'll be in the state for a week or two (at least, I'd guess,), so if you want a closer look at anything let me know.

middle of december last year , a car ran over  my eboard . sent it for re fixing , all are spinning again . and it just turned off in february and i cant find a replacement elsewhere , even from local shop . kinda want to ask my next 18650 supplier(local) for BMS replacement in the near future , or else i wont buy from them .

@RunPlayBack i dont know the diameter but the flat width measures 178mm, 180  would be fine if you cant find the exact size. 190 might be fine too.

You would need to resolder the entire pack, it criss crosses. I have done this, but like I like, you need a spot welder or to solder all cells into the new format. It doesn't work that easily.

Hi guys,

I am wondering whether it will be possible to decompose a Enertion Raptor battery cell into two shorter packs (connected with flexible wires) which can cope with the flex of a Loaded Vanguard (flex 1). Does anybody know by chance how the three parallel groups are arranged? 

Any thoughts???

Cheers
Tobias

so the answer is yes you can split up a space cell into whatever you like if you want to.
you just need to open it up and re arrange it.
I added this to the open space cell thread so that you can reference the photos above.

It just takes time. You need new stripping and time to get it down to cell by cell. If you need it in another shape (like I did), its well worth it.

Hey it works if you solder the bits together I have done it for a year now sometimes it brakes down once in a month but you have to just solder the connections back

Short, slightly related story. I was riding to work today and road debris hit my power switch EXACTLY on my power button and turned it off, what are the odds..

Did you get a lottery ticket right after that, the odds might be in your favor! As much as I hate the button right where I tend to put my feet, it's good if there's an emergency situation I guess

I sometimes use my feet to turn my board from underneath and end up kicking the power sometimes as well. It is a lot easier to turn on without looking than a push button switch though
