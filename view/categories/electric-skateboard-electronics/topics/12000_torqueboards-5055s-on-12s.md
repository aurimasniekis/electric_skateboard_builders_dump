Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone had experience running @torqueboards 5055 190kV motors on 12S in a dual configuration. 

In his site them listed as being 8S max so I wanted to see if anyone had exceeded that without trouble.

You probably can but I'd suggest you watch the heat on the motors. 6355 170KV or 6355 190KV would be a better option.
