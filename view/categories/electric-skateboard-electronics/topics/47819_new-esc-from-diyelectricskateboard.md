Hey there, i was on live chat with diyelectricskateboard about a vesc, and they told me they are releasing a new ESC VERY soon, and were in the process of testing it now. They claimed it solved pretty much all issues of other ESC's. They said it will cost $150+. I was wondering if anybody else knew about this? For some reason I didn't think to screenshot the conversation, but thought people might be interested

There you go, proof and more details! Also, evidently the wheels they carry are 78a for those who didn't know :joy:

I am 100%, for sure it's just a derivative of the VESC 6.4 hardware.

Sounds encouraging, but as they say "the proof is in the pudding".

@stewii  Welcome to my world!

I released the first iphone bluetooth app for the vesc, within days, very quickly afterwards, there were multiple others.

I released the first practically priced hollow core deck, and even though I've been working on this for over 2 years, I'm finally ready for market and all of a sudden, 2 more pop up, lol.

It's the world of business. If people are copying you, then it means your doing something right, yes?

@evoheyax I knew I recognised your logo from somewhere, I have your app installed on my iphone, but I thought it was a new app.

Are you basing your new Vesc off of Vesc 6? Pictures will be appreciated. :kissing_smiling_eyes:

We'll release more info once we're closer to a beta launch/test.

The overall goal though is creating a much more reliable + high performance ESC. There will be on-going development to improve on any issues. So improving the overall design for reliability will be a consistent thing. I have a few engineers working on the actual project.

@NAF was working for similar amount of time I think. I'm not sure did you noticed but no one is copying you. My deck i different shape, lid, and production technology. The same thing is with HYPER BEAST. If I would have to say I was 100% inspired by Ollin. Not sure who was first but I would risk that yours is more of a copy of Ollin than anything else. To be even more precise no one except of Chaka released that deck here. You have two prototypes, I got one and NAF showed one.
All above don't matter much as I'm sure that many more people thought about that kind of deck. It's a general pursuit in design that to do things that looks ordinary but they aren't. Ebikes companys are also doing everything to make their bikes look like ordinary bikes.

Sorry if I offended you. I didn’t mean to. I guess copy is the wrong word.

I think for anyone pursuing hollow core decks used Chakas for at least inspiration. You are right though that I don’t know how yours will close. My deck is still quite different from chakas. But like I said, you know your doing something right when others produce similar products to what you’ve produced, whether copying or because it’s a natural direction for people to go. I think that is what I was trying to say, not trying to accuse anyone of copying.
