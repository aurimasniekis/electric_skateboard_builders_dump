Hey
can i use 24V PSU to charge a 2 3s lipo?
the PSU has 24 Volt and 4 Ah. [link](https://www.amazon.de/Netzteil-Ladeger%C3%A4t-Monitor-Radiowecker-Festplatte/dp/B01I4YDNUW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494061445&sr=8-1&keywords=24v%2B4a%2Bnetzteil&th=1)

i know the voltage of a fully charged lipo ist 25,2V. so is the PSU maybe to weak?

It won't be able to charge the battery fully, only up to about 4v per cell.
It could propably be used in a pinch, but it might not let the BMS balance the cells.
