Anybody have any experience with this ESC?  Is this comparable to a vesc that could power a skateboard motor?

The Biggest BEC on the Block!

Talon HV 120 is the first high voltage controller to come out of the Castle factory with a built-in BEC. This powerhouse features a 20A peak BEC with selectable 6v or 8v output voltage. With a voltage input range from 3S to 12S LiPo, and a 120A continuous amperage capability, it’s capable of up to 6000W of continuous power for a wide variety of heli and fixed wing applications. The sleek aluminum case keeps the ESC cool during high power demand situations. For set-ups with limited airflow, such as under canopies or in a fuselage, there is an optional 40mm fan (sold separately; operates at 4.8 - 7.4 volts). Talon HV 120 has access to Castle’s industry leading software functions, and USB programming capability via Castle Link USB adapter (coupon included)*.
