Hi,

I'm planning on building a 10s4p battery pack with Samsung 30Q's.

I've bought 0.5mm x 6mm brass busbars, these will be around 8cm long and need to carry max 80A.

I've also bought 0.2mm x 10mm pure nickel strips, these will be around 2cm long, doubled up and need carry max 20A.

Could anyone confirm that these materials will be safe for my battery pack please?

Thank you!

I've ordered some copper bus bars 1.5mm x 10mm to replace the brass ones to be safe.

Thanks for confirming that, surprisingly expensive material though, copper!
