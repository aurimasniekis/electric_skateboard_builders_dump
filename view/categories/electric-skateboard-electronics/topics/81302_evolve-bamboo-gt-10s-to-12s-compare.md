Hi Guys,

Am trying to figure out how some after market battery mods for the Evolve Bamboo GT go from a 10s to a 12s config?

You can increase the p value but not the s value, correct?

How is this being done or did I misunderstand what it was for?

Evolve electronics are only happy at 10S.  It's not really an option unless you're talking about replacing the electronics.

Like @b264 said you'd need to buy 2 vescs for 12s because the evolve escs are set to cutoff values for a 10s battery and using a 12s battery would (in addition to probably blowing up your esc while riding) cause the cells to be drained to a dangerous level before the esc hits cutoff. So really the question is what do you want from a 12s battery? More range/less voltage sag or speed? Because the range/voltage sag could be solved by making a custom 10s4p pack or sending your board to @longhairedboy to make one for you. And if you want more speed get 200 kv racestar motors and a higher gearing ratio. (Although I wouldn't recommend going too fast on those evolve double kingpin trucks)

After reading up more about Evolve and their issues I think I have decided to sell my Bamboo GT and focus on a custom esk8. I like the ideas presented here, especially the one involving using 2 VESC's instead of ESC's (could anyone describe to me the major differences?). Furthermore I think I would like to explore a 4WD option. Would this still apply in this situation or would I need 4 VESC's? How would I wire them together? Thanks!

A VESC is a type of esc, but it's programmable so you can choose how much power you draw and what your battery cutoffs are. You would need 4 vescs for 4 wheel drive (people have tried doing 1 vesc for 2 wheels but it isn't very practical) you might also want to ask yourself if you really need 4 wheel drive. Dual is plenty for most people and with 4 wheel drive it can be very expensive and heavy. And for the wiring just use the search function I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.
