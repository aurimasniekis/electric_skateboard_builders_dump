I've got a brand new blue/black battery enclosure and maybe a used ecu/remote

Honestly I would just get a vesc and use the same battery, you'll get 17-18mph out of the same battery/motor

Ok , I honestly donâ€™t know what a (vesc) is I bought an ego a couple of years ago and have been using it to get back and forth to work on the beach . I donâ€™t know a whole lot about them I just know the ecu went out and the battery cover is broke from years of riding . Iâ€™ll look into a (vesc) though , but how much would it be for your battery enclosure and ecu?
```

## \#25 Posted by: scepterr Posted at: 2018-01-06T11:52:05.193Z Reads: 43

```
Enclosure $40 + ship
Vesc is an opensource ESC/ecu
It'll give you much more configurability and performance, it will require a new remote as well. New vescs start at $100 and remotes $30


I gotta look for the ECU, havent seen it in a while but I know it's somewhere ðŸ˜‹
