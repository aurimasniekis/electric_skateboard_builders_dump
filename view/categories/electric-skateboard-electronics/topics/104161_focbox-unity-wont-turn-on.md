I bought a focbox off amazon and have used it in my build for about a day when it suddenly shut off and wouldn't power back on. I shorted the pins leaving the unity always on, and I was using the battery and I've checked that they were okay. 

 Checked the battery and it was delivering power to the unity so I'm not sure what's going on here. Has this happened to anyone? Should I get it replaced by Amazon?
