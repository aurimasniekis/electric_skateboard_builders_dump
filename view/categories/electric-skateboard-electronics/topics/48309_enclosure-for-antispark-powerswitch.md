Hey guys

I made this box to put your antispark powerswitch in, if you bought it naked ;) It's easy printable with a 3d printer, if you want the STL files PM me :slight_smile:

If you don't have acces to a 3D printer you can find the box [here](https://electricboardsolutions.com/products/power-switch-with-case).

It's very sporting of you to offer the STL file for those who can, and the product for those who can't.:+1:
