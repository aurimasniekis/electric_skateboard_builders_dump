So I’m looking to replace mine with sensored ones for that smooth startup. The current 5055 motors on my kit has 8mm shaft diameter. I’m looking to find something that’s similar so I don’t have to change the pulley. [My current motor specs](http://www.diyeboard.com/270kv-n5055-outrunner-motor-1400w-for-diy-electric-skateboard-p-539.html?zenid=i12rn9ag3fh82qdhv8hihbnvs0)

The only one I’ve found so far is the Maytech 5055, however their motor has a 6mm shaft, so a bit smaller than mine.

Wouldn't it be just as easy to buy a new motor with an appropriate pulley
As it would be to buy a new motor that fits the pulley you already have and then have to take that pulley off your current Motor to put on the new Motors?

Take a look at this https://www.janux-esk8.com/product-page/janux-flux-drive-6354-190kv

I found a similar motor on [Flipsky website](https://flipsky.net/products/6354-190kv-2450w-2) that’s $60 + $15 shipping. Is there any difference besides the $35 difference?

You can also look at the racerstar motors I think there is a 5045 and a 5065 motor.

I think I [found it](https://www.racerstar.com/Racerstar-5045-BRH5045-200KV-6-12S-Brushless-Motor-For-Balancing-Scooter-p-112.html)
What could be the trade-off with this slightly shorter motor? 
My current motor is 270kv, the racerstar is 200kv, so I gain a little bit more torque?

You will be fine with 10s you should actually be using 190-200kv for a 10s battery

What do different sizes mean for a motor? Like what’s the difference between a 6374 and a 6354 motor, for example?

What matters is the stator size inside the motor, unfortunately this info is not available most of the time

For example, there’s cases of a 6364 motor having the same stator of a 6355

With a bigger stator you can run higher current before saturation occurs, also you have more mass and surface area to absorve and dissipate heat

If your board it’s not a high speed one and you are not really heavy you will probably be fine with these motors at 10S, I’m happy with my dual 5055

I don’t need to go fast, I’d prefer it to have enough torque to climb up hill since it’s pretty hilly where I live. So that means with a bigger motor, I can push more amps into it to make it take off faster? What’s your 5055 and does it have sensors?

I have 5065 270kv AT kit 10s3p battery. Strong enough carry stiff hills and im almost 200lbs speed settings #2 above pussy mode.lol

It’s from @torqueboards , unfortunately they don’t sell them anymore

They had sensors, but I removed, now for my next build I’m putting them back

Take a look at these videos to have an idea of the performance 

I also add a temperature sensor and will be easier to see how much current I can put in then without overheat, for now I use 40 A each

Keep in mind that my board is severely battery limited, I have a max of 30A drain, só in hills the speed drop, if I had a battery capable of 60 A or more it would climb way faster, but that’s fine for me

Is that the [Agacê Cruiser](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/agace-cruiser-33-dual-5055-dual-vesc-6-paris-195mm-10s3p-ncr-ga-kegels-lots-of-3d-print/64307)? Man that looks impressive! You designed your own truck, motor mounts and enclosures?

That's the one, thanks

Enclosures and motor mount, the trucks are Paris 195mm modified a bit, but as you can see there it was not a good idea
