Hi, i a question about multiple ride modes, with a toggle switch on the remote. I have bougth a remote off Flipsky (https://flipsky.net/collections/accessories/products/2-4g-nano-remote-controller) and i has a switch that enables me to either give a 100% throttle or 80%, but i cant seem to change this. Maybe someone here has some experience?

You need to set up your receiver in high mode. If you set your remote up in low mode it will not work.
