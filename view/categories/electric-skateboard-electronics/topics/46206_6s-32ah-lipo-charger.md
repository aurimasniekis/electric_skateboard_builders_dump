More Watts means you have the capability to charge at a higher amp.  For your case I wouldn't buy a charger under 500-600w so you can at least charge one battery at 1C rate.  But also do as said.  All these questions are on this forum already and go on hobby King and pick your charger with that watt output.  But honestly you can get whatever charger.  

Go research.
