There are a lot of quality differences between vendors so search the forum for a particular vendor that could interest you

```
my order of preference:

VESC Six - $$$$ from Trampa only right now

VESC 4.12 variants:
Ollin Board Co - both regular and Direct Fet - $$$
Enertion FOCBOX - $$
Axle 4.12 - $$
DIYes - $

Maytech - i'd avoid.

True.  If you are in EU - a great option!  I've not tried any of the direct fet versions, but have heard great things about esk8.de.  Not sure how price compares with the others i mentioned.

Our price was from 119.-€ ( 4.12 PCB only) 149.-€ 4.12 completely 
and the new ESK8 1.1 Controller was 199.-€
Not the cheapest but a good alternate to V6.
Nowind was testing the ESK8 1.1 Controller since two weeks in Dual systems and FOC
and he hasn´t burning it  :joy:
