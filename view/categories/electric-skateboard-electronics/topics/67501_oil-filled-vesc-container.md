Hey guys,  I work in the oil and gas industry piloting and working on ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicles) AKA remotely controlled submarines.  We use oil to fill some electrical housings which is positively compensated with oil compensators.  The oil protects the housings since its a liquid and can't be compressed like a 1 atmosphere housing.  In addition the oil dissipates heat. 

My question is has anyone ever tried to fill a housing with oil and place a VESC in it to see how the vesc performs?  I'm just being curious.

What a question! I doubt anyone has filled a Vesc in some kind of oil container. Probably explode!

We have plenty of electronics on the sub in oil.  The oil is non conductive.

Seems like an interesting way of cooling vesc's.

What would happen if the oil started boiling :joy: ??

the stuffs like mineral oil, it doesn't conduct electricity, only heat. people are making pcs now that are cooled with mineral oil

Tellus 22, Royal purple 22 and WD40 are all non conductive as well.  We use Royal purple 22 on our ROV's.

nope the closest thing to it is vegetable oil.

I recall a discussion recently about doing this. I think in the end it was decided that without a pump to move the oil and an active radiator (perhaps fan cooled fins?) the oil would just heat up to the point where it became detrimental to the vesc, because of how small the enclosure is.

Perhaps someone with more experience could chime in.

Ah man, this happened to me once in a former life.  HPA for a radar cooked itself in its oil... it was like a deep fat firer! :joy:

Isn't it going to be heavy? I know Linus complained about the mineral oil pc being super heavy.

You're probably only going to need between 10 to 20 oz to fill a container.

I got a notification for a linked post. I took Flipsky SECS 6.6 with the aluminium case and filled it with oil. It works at 36V as expected from learning about it for pc cooling. I haven't been able to do any running tests because it leaks from places I still have to seal with automotive RTV. I realize doing this may become problematic if resoldering the DRV8301 or MOSFETs for repairs. I should have also added an auto drain bolt for easy oil maintenance.

I still have to test this on a alternator I converted for a future build for a chibi kart with skateboard parts.

There was some oil-cooled mining rigs back in the day in largish containers, esk8 worth it& possible?

 would be interesting to see, please post your results

Sounds messy and gross to me. :face_vomiting: 

How do you seal all the wires perfectly? Does each wire have to come out through a cable gland, these things are pretty bulky.

Submarine, eh? That'll be the name we are going to use from now on when someone comes with a VESC oil container for Esk8 applications using oil to fill electrical housings. New jargon boys: **the Submarine**... :point_down:

I love it!

I don't like chain drives because I remember getting crap all over my levi 501s riding my bike to my girlfriends house.  Oil filled enclosures.  It can only end in lonely nights at home.

Oil Cooling electronics has been used since the beginning of electric equipment. One problem for our application is oil wicking up and out stranded wire leads.

I wouldn't be to worried about oil wicking since it would be minimal.  I have umbilicals that we use on the ROV that are 4000m with a positively compensated umbilical quick disconnect the the wicking is negligible at best.  I'm not saying I'm going to build an enclosure for my VESC and does this its was just a curiosity thing.

I thought about the concept of oil cooling and it is true that in the system there is a need for heat exchange . i made watterproof adapter for my fsesc but i must add ribbing to the bottom of the adapter . motor cables are at the highest point, fluid leakage is minimal![2|690x458](upload://uEEAiVbhjV1m6IsRq8ZuBhlIuTT.jpeg) ![5|690x458](upload://iBE4jv2RdkgWJaqCY3ERU7G7WUC.jpeg) ![IMG_20181223_124224|666x500](upload://67ZtkUfrElBk5rfD9ZO04D31v9T.jpeg) ![IMG_20181118_180630|375x500](upload://rruTQMPmi3LhF4Tqc9695fK5kvD.jpeg) ![IMG_20181226_153751|666x500](upload://2Z0DzvpDufFXmi7oIRMJmfkNa8U.jpeg) ![IMG_20181226_153910|666x500](upload://7kymR1uIH4e2Sr2z4bi6qyK2IEE.jpeg) ![IMG_20181226_153816|666x500](upload://Q7ANE60HOt2l2hGwm10eEmS78c.jpeg)

Great fun for an experiment, but I would exhaust air cooling with a good heatsink first before using oil or water.

If you ever want to try it hit and use an escape or have a cad drawing of the housing hit me up and I'll machine it at cost for science if you make it so it can be done on a 3axis cnc. I made the case below for my escape and with a top cover in alu I suspect that it would be perfect for this. The cad model isn't mine here but it's not to hard to sketch up something that would fit.

This sounds like a good idea and it would only require small changes to the escape housing to make it sealed. The wires is another story tho but that could be fixed with some sealer I guess. 

The stranded wires could become a problem like @MoeStooge says since oil might creep in them. I remember that Mercedes had this problem on their 722.6 auto boxes when it started to leak oil from up in the ecu housing through the cable loom.

An advantage to using oil would not only be the cooling component but surely the waterproof aspect. 
Obviously the container would need to be sealed, which would prevent water going in (and oil going out), but if for some reason water does get in, it wont harm the VESC due to the separation in densities causing the water to stay away from the VESC (this would also mean no rust!)

Water is heavier than oil so any water would accumulate in the bottom.  Ideally you would need a very small positive compensation system to force oil in of there is a leak but ultimately I think that would be over kill.
