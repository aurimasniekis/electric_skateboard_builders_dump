So I just got my vesc and configured all the settings. Whenever I pull the throttle all the way, the power slowly decreases until it stops. Then a red light flashes 5 times. I can get it to work again if i turn off the power but it eventually will do it again. Any idea on what this is and can be solved?

Yes leave it at 57V

Your batt max is a little high in my opinion, i would set it to 30A

And set your abolute max at 130A

98% sure this is a manufacturing defect, no bad settings would cause this to happen

Well you would be shutting off the temperature protection... and im not entirely sure that the reading is good or not

Maybe one of your mosfets is actually shorted out and is getting hot

Hard for me to tell, there's a forum in the way

Sensors will help the startup torque, you need to do a motor detection so the vesc knows the hall table, after that just tick the sensor mode

You also have to connect the motor wires a certain way to run sensors or you will fry something. 
Do not attempt sensor operation until you've done your homework on it.

Not sure what you mean here, he has tb motors with sensors, he just needs to plug them in the sensor port of the vesc and run a motor detection so the vesc can know the position of the sensors

When you run motors sensored, you have to match the phase wires between the Esc and motor. 
Unless the Vesc is different than all other Esc's concerning this.

Yes the vesc is able to detect the position of the hall sensors, you can put them in any order

In both modes you can detect the hall sensor position, but you need to it in it's respective tab

I have the same problem, starts out around 100-107, also the pins for the rc receiver was completely loose. I waited several months too, super frustrating... since I can't test it with my receiver, I can't see what the temperature effect would be after running for a while either...

I have the exact same issues (110+ C FET temps) and fault showing up on my VESC that I just received from  this week. I thought it was an issue with my settings and have been double- and triple-checking everything.

To me, this just confirms that they have a bad batch.

@basselope @LordSnow @hannesr @mnelson3690

  Is anybody able to read the resistor code of **R2**, should be a 3 digit code

I have a feeling you all have a common problem

Yeah @torqueboards what should we do? The best I got from you was to send it back (didn't get any response on what to do with shipping, shipping here alone was $40)... I'm also not eager to wait another two months ore more like I did with this one. Now you went into non responsive mode. I would've been a loyal customer if you only treated with respect, and not cheated me with my money... Oh and it was also delayed a month from estimated delivery...

Hey guys.. Sorry didn't see this info until I got tagged.

There actually seems to be an issue with a bad R1 component. We've tested it and R1 fixed the issue. So it's just a bad temp sensor component. You would have to replace it.

We'll be happy to replace it for you. It would require you to ship back your current VESC. We can give you credit for the shipping costs and send you a new VESC as a replacement.

I'll send a direct PM to each of you who mentioned as we should have a new batch with the R1 issue fixed.

@mnelson3690
@hannesr
@lordsnow
@basselope

For anyone else who has an issue please contact me via email dexter@ and/or Live Chat. It's not too often we check the forums. 

@hannesr - Contact us on live chat and we can help you. If your looking for immediate help I'd refer to Live Chat. We can ship it out to you soon and/or put it aside. Unfortunately, you are overseas so this isn't as easy. Typically, we recommend overseas customers to purchase a bigger order for free shipping.

@torqueboards

I also have the exact same problems that were mentioned in a previous post (loose remote-pins and mosfet temp. readings starting from 110C). The pins were easy to solder back but I've got no idea of the mosfet temps. How dangerous would it be for the VESC to just run the board without those sensors? 

The riding season is starting soon so is there some intelligent solution to my problem? And by that I mean like shipping VESC back to you. The VESC hasn't been ridden yet but the powering wires are shortened.

Greeting from Finland, by sending it back there could be some problems with customs but I guess it can be managed.

We'll it's better to switch them out. They're actually in a convenient place on the VESC and isn't as difficult as other things. You can ship them back and we'll send you new ones. Up to you. Let us know :)
