Luckily you came to the right place. You have a bunch of smart mother f@ckers that know all types of this stuff. @Blasto & @JohnnyMeduse are the two guys I know that know just about all vesc things. There are more here too that might chime in too.

the 285ohms is alright, it does mean that the can circuit should be OK, now next step to figuring out what is the issue with the Can is to look at the parameter, just to sure that you not missing a simple checkbox in your parameter.
