Does anyone know if using a copper braid such as [this one from amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HGHQYC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) will allow for a solid connection between cells on a 10s4p battery? 

What do you use as a preferred connection?

I tried to use that method - it wont work in this specific build due to soldering the strips onto the battery. I have the necessary spot welder now, but it will not work with this setup due to the soldering.
