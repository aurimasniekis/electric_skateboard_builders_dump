If by riding with the motor not on generates a current, why can we not recharge the battery by riding the longboard normally? I feel it would be similar to regenerative breaking.

It does generate a current it's just negligible

There's also usually some amount of resistance that makes it's not so much fun.

It's not free energy, it will be harder to ride
and will be less efficient to charge it while riding and then use the battery, than just ride without charging.
