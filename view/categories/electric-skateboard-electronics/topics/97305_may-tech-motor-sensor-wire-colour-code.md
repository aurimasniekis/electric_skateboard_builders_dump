Hi, and thanks to everybody in this forum, thanks to you I have made a great mountainboard!

About the sensor wires, I had some troubles a few weeks ago, I tried to do the sensors detection on 2 brand new motors I bought on amazon. 
It was impossible, so I checked on this forum and found some people that had the same trouble with maytech motors, but no solution. 

I finally found the solution: the orange wire was the positive and the red was one of the sensors.

I precise that my motors are not Maytech but it's also a chinese brand so maybe it's the same problem...
