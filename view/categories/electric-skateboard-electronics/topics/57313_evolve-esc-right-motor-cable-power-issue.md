I frayed a power cable that connects from the ESC to my right motor during a ride (DiY battery pack, too large, physically pushed the cable into a circuit board edge during a test ride). Upon troubleshooting the issue, I found that the motor that worked during the test ride is now hardly performing. The motor is no longer rotating; it just twitches slightly. When connecting to the non-damaged esc power cable, the motor works. Would anyone happen to know what the cause/solution may be?

I tried to splice & solder the frayed wire together, but the issue is still occurring. Am I screwed? Do I need to buy a replacement ESC?

If you swap the left & right motors and the same one still fails, the ESC is bad.  If you swap them and you switch which one works, then the motor is bad.

Where on the circuit board did the wire get pushed onto?  Do you have a photo of or know the exact place?  Is there a burn mark on the circuit board?

It was wrapped around the corner in both of the above pics. Unfortunately, the motors only fail when connecting to that damaged wire. I think you are correct; instead of the issue being isolated to the frayed cable, my ESC is most likely damaged.

I could not see any burn marks on the ESC right off the bat. I could open it up for further inspection, but I am starting to think a replacement is necessary.

Im interested in this as well. I dont have evolve but dual chinese esc is doing similar behaviour - one 'side' of esc works, while the other twiches the motor..

In my case I can even ride a bit but it cogs and wants to stop the motor badly..

I will check whenever caps are all ok, as this was the only thing I can come up with or it is just software related somehow.. 

Anyways.. would be cool to find out what causes twiching in general
