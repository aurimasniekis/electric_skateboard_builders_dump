Hey guys, I started having a weird problem with my board yesterday after riding about 20 miles.  With my remote and board both turned on (failsafe set up on both correctly) the motor will now randomly spin and brake without my input.  It only happens after I ride for a bit which makes it even weirder...

What happens when you cutoff the remote and leave deck on and everything else same?

two option's here

1- increase you deadband a bit, to let's say 20ms (default is 15ms)

2- use Ack's bldctool 2.54, recenter your signal with the "center pulsewidth". Can't do that with 2.18, can only input max and min.

3rd not recommended: play around with your trim. (should actually put a bit on a hotglue on that)

how does your signal look when you tick the "display"?

is it bouncing all over the place or is it fairly stable (+-1ms)

I think I may have been an idiot.  The motor pulley was rubbing against the mount... It created a pocket for itself.  I took the pulley off and no more twitching or random braking
but...
I forgot to take my key out and spun the motor so my key is probably somewhere in Narnia right now...

Yeah, well, that should only affect resistance while riding?  I think there may be a different underlying issue.  Sounds like a wire is bouncing off itself or you've got interference to me.

yea not sure... I cant seem to replicate the issue anymore.  Interference isn't what I think it is, I'm using the jlabs mini and my receiver is mounted outside the enclosure.  All my connectors are fully seated and zip tied togethervso really confused lol

I would suggest hooking up a different controller, if you have one. I had a similar problem with the "winning" remote that would only happen after riding for a bit. Very surprised to see this on the Mini.

Have you checked for shorts and/or water damage?

```
yea never ridden through puddles or rain or anything of the sort. shorts are pretty much impossible at this point, insulated everything with kapton, hot glue, and foam.  think itâ€™s because I was braking on a full battery

I had similar issues back in spring. It was the positive power wire to the vesc that was loose

Still be careful with electronic mounted outside of your enclosure.
After a bit of riding time you may have debris and dirt inside everything, which also could lead to shorts or random stuff like your stuttering
