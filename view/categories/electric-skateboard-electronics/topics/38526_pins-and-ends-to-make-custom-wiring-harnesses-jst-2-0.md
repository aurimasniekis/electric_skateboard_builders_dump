Hey all. 
I'm struggling trying to find which pins to bulk order and where to get them, along with different ends to have the ability to make my own wiring harnesses. Would be really useful for all kinds of different situations ie motor sensors, balance lead changes and other such projects. 
Anybody doing this? 
Care to share where you're buying your supplies from? 
Thanks!

I use digikey and mouser. Here are male pin sockets in various numbers:

This started because im swapping bms's and struggled to find a 10 pin. Plus, most of the leads would be too short. But ya, mostly ebay or Amazon or ali express provides.

You're welcome! I had a similar issue, I shorted the balance connector on my battery and had to replace the plug and wires.
