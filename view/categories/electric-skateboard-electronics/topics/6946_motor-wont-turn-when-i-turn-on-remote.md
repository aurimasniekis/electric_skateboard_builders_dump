hi guys, recently everything that could go wrong with my board has happened and its frustrating. after thinking i sorted everything out my motor wont turn now. ive linked a video showing what i mean. idk what this could be, ive already checked the phase wires and they are not touching. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqWsnc4Dz1s

I think you are using a VESC? Maybe you can see in BLDC tool what the ppm signal is and its behaviour.

i checked the realtime data but the problem is with my computer it cuts almost all of the information off at the bottom and i can resize it to fit

After opening the remote I found this wire disconnected and I think it reconnects right between the white and black one. Torque<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d1b307c31be7198b0a5f062aaaca0ce081bfc064.jpg" width="666" height="500">boards is this right?

It looks like the wire must be connected to that spot and could be your problem. I think this wire goes to a potentiometer? If so it explains why your remote is not responding to throttle.
