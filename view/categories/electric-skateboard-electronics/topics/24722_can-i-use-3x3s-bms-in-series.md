Hi guys
I searched but couldnt really find an answer..
If I only need a BMS for charging, and have 3 x 3s2p zippy lipos, could I use some of the bms boards from ebay, for 3S ?

I would only use bms for balance charging.. not running from, but wouldn't it still be fine, instead of buying an expensive 9s bms ? :)

no. Unless you want to use 3 BMS's. If you use a 3S BMS in a 9S system I would not be surprised if you start a fire. (at the very least you are going to get smoke)

If you use the balance leads only this should be possible. There was a nice video posted yesterday on how to charge a 12s battery with a 6s charger. You have to solder to wires to the positive and negative balance leads and use those for charging. I can't find the thread though.
If it's unclear I will look for it tomorrow.
