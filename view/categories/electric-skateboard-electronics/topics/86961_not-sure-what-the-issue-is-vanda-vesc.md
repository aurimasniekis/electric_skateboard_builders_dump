Ok so I just received 2 new Vanda vesc's for my AWD set up. One of the vesc's worked perfectly right away. The other turns on but won't power the motor. Please help. Also I don't have the cord yet to connect to my computer so idk what's going on digitally. But Vanda supposedly programed them already to my specs and like I said one works perfectly one doesn't  power the motor... I'm a noob so anything helps thanka![IMG_20190311_112701430|666x500](upload://9Y1KfysEq3C71crpPALyEfW2wu.jpeg)
