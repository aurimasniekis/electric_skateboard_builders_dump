Can I combine 2 turnigy 3s 5000mah 20c lipo batteries with a turnigy 4s 5000mah 20c hardcase lipo? 

This is the 4s battery

These are the 3s ones

I would suggest against it. Unless you're certain that individual 1s cells inside both packs are identical, then maybe.

Hmm ok they will be charged separately as one 6s and one 4s pack and only connected together for discharge

Don't risk it. 

Unmarried cells are a nightmare.

@UniqueSnowflakeN27  Ok so what if I was to get two of those 4s batteries and the same type just in 2s that would work right?

If you want to run batteries in series I would highly recommend using the same exact batteries or even better, buy two new batteries so you know the cells are all balanced.  The short answer is yes, two of the same batteries will work well in series.

Well, I highly recommend you use all the same batteries in series. Theoretically your way should work but I'm not 100% sure, if you can, I would recommend going with Li-ion because the cells are physically tougher and are overall safer but Lipo is cheaper and more ceccptable to damage and WAY less safe unless of course, you plan on investing in a BMS
