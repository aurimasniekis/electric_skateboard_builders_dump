I'm starting a new dual hub build using torqueboard's new hubs. I have set up many VESCs before but this is a first ever for both hubs and the FOCBOX. Does anything change significantly? Should I have a low motor max to keep hubs cool? 
My specs:
Running in FOC mode
x2 FOCBOX
x2 130KV torqueboard's hubs
Torqueboard's 6S4P li ion battery
```
