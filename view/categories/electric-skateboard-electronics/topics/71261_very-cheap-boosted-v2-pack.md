I bought a brand new boosted v2 battery pack from my friend for $80, and it seems that he seems to have more than one battery pack, and he has sold dozens of them.Wait for the battery pack to arrive and I will test it. I have a boosted v2 dual

YES, you need to short-circuit one of the ports, the battery can output normally.

Yes it's true but no one need a standard range battery now and it's really hard to pull out the cells from the case.
But with this information you may see people who use them for DIY.

Is it possibe to buy two, rip out the bms, and put them in  parralel with a bestech bms? Part of me wants one cause its $80, but then the other part is saying why? You could get more rangw with lipos for the same price right? Cause if you don't use it with a boosted board you would have to use a different bms

Well apparently op us saying you can enable the onboard BMS to output by shorting the middle data pin to ground. Not sure if he tested if it will actually output any current.

The boosted BMS is incredibly thin. No other BMS I've seen would drop in place of it and allow for the case to close back up.

Hi Solodros,

Are you saying these cheap boosted packs are fake ? Or are they the recalled batch ?
I've just bought one of them and not sure what to do.

Pretty sure those are the batteries that people had to return when boosted were replacing all the packs due to some incidents where they were catching flames.
They just had to give them to recycling centers, someone realized you can make some cash on it and he just sells those.

Yeah it is exactly that. B2sr is the recalled model if you Google and that's what I bought. How do you get the power light to go green? Once I get it to work I will test capacity. It looks brand new.
