```
When i connect the VESC to the computer it does not recognize it. When i plug power to the vesc it is blue for a second and then blinks red three times then goes back to blue, don't know if that is what it's supposed to do or not. I have tired updating the driver on the computer but didn't work. I have tried using a different computer still nothing. I bought the VESC a couple weeks ago off of diyelectricstakeboard.com. I don't know what else to try any help would be great, i have read a lot of forums on here and cant find a solution. Thanks

The USB cable is the one that came with the VESC from diyelectricskateboard. I dont have another one but i can buy one tomorrow and give that a try.

This.  If you can see the com port - use it.

OR maybe even try the new VESC tool and see if it's easier for you.  Still might need a spare USB cable to troubleshoot.  And try to avoid the super long 10ft ones...

GL!

In the vesc tool, close to the top right there should be a drop down menu that says "com port" click it and see if anything shows up

I guess new USB cable is the only thing I'd recommend then

Check your drivers if your using Windows and make sure your computer can see the VESC.
