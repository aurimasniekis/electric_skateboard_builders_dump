for a 12s system, with routed wires throughout a 38 inch deck, what awg wires should be used? i thought 10 awg, but on amazon, it said it could do 45 amps... any suggestions?

12awg Quality cable Would be fine,
if your not sure about the quality 10awg would be safer.

If you use proper silicone wire (tinned copper) AFAIK 10AWG is up to 140A, 12AWG about 90A and 14AWG 55A.  But the inner resistance is less with thicker cables so I would suggest 12AWG or if the cables are very long 10AWG. You can order from hobbyking, nice price.
