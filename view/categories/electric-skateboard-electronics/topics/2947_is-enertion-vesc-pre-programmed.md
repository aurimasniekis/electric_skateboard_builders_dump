Guys, i have the opportunity to buy a magneto board really cheap, i know the ESC on this board is horrible, thats why i want to change it to a enertion VESC. My question is, is this VESC pre-programmed? I really want to just plug it in and go on.

If it is not pre-programmed, is it difficult to configure?

It isn't pre-programmed, but it's not very difficult 

Just search 'VESC faq' on the forum search and read up on some of the forum topics- you will need to download the BLDC tool program, but it's all pretty simple.

I believe it comes preset for use with r-spec motors.

It has default settings that fit space cell and R-spec motors

```
Xt60 for battery and no connectors for motor.
At least that's how I got mine.
The female bullets came with the motors and had to be soldered on.
