I think people who remove them sand the spots off.  Metal isn't that thick so don't go crazy

You may blow a hole in the nickel strip you are trying to spot weld if when ur welding the tips touch that spot

I guess to your advice I have to. Sand the 210 cells I salvaged last month it's gonna be a pain in the ass

And use some isopropyl alcohol or acetone to clean afterwards before welding
