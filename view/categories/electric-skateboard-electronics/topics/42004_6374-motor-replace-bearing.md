Does anyone know how to and what bearing I need to use? I have a defective Torqueboard motor.

If I'm not mistaken they are 8*16*5mm nsk bearings.

They do indeed look like them, if its them i might order one and take it to a shop to try to get it pressed out and the new one in.

But have no idea how to since the pcb is stuck on the bearing plate.-

Get yourself one of these to get the front side(side the shaft sticks out) first. Work the bearing out. Then press the back one out through the stator

What is that thing called? I tried pressing mine out with a round object imo it seemed like it was totally stuck in there and needed a press.

They're called through bearing pullers. They're designed to be rocked and the rocking motion works the bearing outward.

You can put a smaller than 8mm shaft into the other side and tap lightly in a circle with a mallet while the stator is held if a vice as well... If you can't source the tool
