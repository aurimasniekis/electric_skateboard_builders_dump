So I made a stupid mistake on plugging in my Vesc with the polarity reversed. Instant spark on the board. It looks like the plate next to the canbus was shorted right where the positive wire is on the reverse side of the PCB. Can I fill in the shorted metal piece with solder to try to fix it?! Thanks in advance.

I guess you could always try but make sure to power it with a low power supply at about 12v.

I was lucky a did this not long ago with a flipsky, it was connected to my desktop psu so I think the psu cut power once it new it was being shorted and saved the vesc
