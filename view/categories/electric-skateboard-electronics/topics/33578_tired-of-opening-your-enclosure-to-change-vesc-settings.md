So I got tired of opening my enclosure all of the time to switch settings on my vesc. I searched around the internet and came across this mini USB connector.

Really easy to mount and pretty cheap through Amazon. It can be found here

I'm was going to do the same to both of mine but they are pretty much set it and forget it. Do you guys use them that often?

I like this idea but I spent ages trying to find the same thing but with a water proof cover. I came up with nothing.
Anyone find a waterproof solution?

GREAT idea! I love how easy to mount it is with those screw holes. Buying one. 

I did something similar except I used the standard USB cable. so I have to use a USB extension to plug it in.

I did the same thing with my VESC.  Except I bought a Mini-USB male to Micro-USB female adapter.  Now I can charge my GT2B and program the VESC with same cable.  Nothing uses Mini-USB anymore...

I bought waterproof Micro-USB plugs on eBay from China.  They were a $1 for 25

That's double the price and not as clean.

You came into someones thread and posted a link to your own thread.  No words,  and no additional input. Pretty sure that's called hijacking.

 I pointed out that the solution listed in your thread wasn't as easy to mount, or as clean. Now you seem upset. I must be missing something here?

I saw it on youtube by someones build log. After 2 months i found myself wanting it, but couldn't find the video anymore. So, it is out there somewhere :pensive:

It's not a duplicate thread, the connector in this post is completely different than what you posted.....If you believe they are the same then that's part of the problem. **I knew you thought this was a duplicate post and i knew that's why you posted a link your thread trying to insinuate this was a double,  however, you are wrong**

Plugging a removable cord into a permanently mounted setup IS NOT AS CLEAN. This is the equivalent of running an extension cord to an outlet in your garage.....The connector in this thread is a 1 piece setup with mount holes already installed..... But anyway, believe it or not, I did not come here to argue about which one was cleaner

How is posting an observation being a dick? I made an observation(a correct one by the way), and you deiced to call me a dick.

You sure about that? Because it seems like you're the only one upset here

Calm down, dude. It's a USB cable...

Show me where I got upset? I was having a discussion about the topic at hand here. Until someone responded with "lol, ok dude".

Can we get this thread back on track. No one gives a shit who linked what or when. 

This connector is an great idea. Its small and meets the requirements. @Fiori did you ever find a way to cover this plug so it doesn't get dust and crud into the port?

No I did not find anything waterproof. However,  @smurf found a pretty cool waterproof connector he post a link(http://m.ebay.com/itm/USB-3-0-Panel-Pass-Through-Female-Industrial-Connector-Waterproof-Data-Power-/1222580535145)

I did find these that look good for dust and stuff though:

I wasn't able to find a waterproof solution so far. I was thinking about putting some tape over it lol.

And that's what happens when I reply without reading everyone's replies lol. 

I had seen @mmaner post before awhile back but found this one piece cable that was easier to implement and also cheaper. It's nice to have options ðŸ˜Š Wasn't trying to out do anyone, just posting up a different solution.

That's the one I've got. If you don't have a rubber plug, just stick a cut off male connector into that and it's dust sealed.

been there, done that. Having it was awesome in the beginning, but after finalizing setup, I rode it until I sold it and never used it. I opened up my current build about 7 times now, but not going to drill two holes into this one this time around
