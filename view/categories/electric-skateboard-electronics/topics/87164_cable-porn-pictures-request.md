So I'm always trying to make the "perfect product" and I want to spend some time on the cables inside and outside the board. Wondering if anyone has some nice examples (pictures) that they could post.

Quite interested in:
- what connectors you use (to interface from inside to outside of your enclosure)
- what sheath you use to protect your wires
- how you interface the sensor wire to the inside of your enclosure (I was thinking about DB9s)
- the internal wiring looms. I like modular looms and the ability to plug things easily

Here's my current cable arrangement. Some 3D printing to make things nice and clean, but not happy about the sensor wire arrangement (also the cable tie is temporary).
