Hello everybody,

I'm new to this electronic buisness and i'm making my own electric bike. I have a 6s3p batterypack with the torque ESC. For the input i have these E-bike throttles: https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07FFVTR29/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
. The problem that i have is that can't find any good step-by-step tutorials on how to setup the VESC with E-bike throttles. 
Does anybody have some tips or helpful links? 
Thanks for the help.
