Just gathering parts for my first build. Just took a bit of a impulse buy, and bought a single one of these VESCs from ebay user 'naama1485' or from 'Green motion electric vehicle solutions' based in Israel.

I just wanted to see if anyone on here could shed any light on the quality of these, are they rebranded Chinese VESC Should I avoid using them in VOC?

Will be posting a build log soon when my parts start to arrive, so we can all see the outcome.

As far as I know they are rebranded maytech from china. They run in BLDC mode but don't like FOC.

not possible they tells me to buy their STlink. I told them it's buggy fmw but they deny their fault and blame vadder. i disputed in aliexpress to stop their business. long story short never buy maytech esc.

That looks strange, although it seems you could buy one for cheap on ebay if this is the only way to update FW.

You can also push firmware via new VESC Tool without STLink - once released.  Still Beta, but i did this for two older VESC 4.7 with no problem.

Unsure on VESC Tool release... but helps those w/o bootloader (to update fw).

You already bought it so there is one important thing to check before using it as @onepunchboard mentioned. I have 2 maytech and both had buggy FW. You have to check your current ramp step setting in advanced tab. It should be 0.04 (mine was 40 :astonished:) Everytime you click read or write configuration this value gets multiplicated by 10. You can test this by clicking read configuration several times and watch the current ramp step value. If it stays equal at 0.04 you don't have a bug. But if so you have to set 0.004 and then write configuration (after that the value stay at 0.04 as long as you don't read configuration again). This is the reason why many people fry maytech V4.12. And don't try FOC!

As @sl33py said, you can wait for the new VESC-Tool for uploading your bootloader and firmware. I did it with both maytech's and it's super easy! If you want to do it right now with STLink you can PM me, I ordered a cheap one but won't use it.

Haha, this is a shame! Also I can't believe they still deliver with faulty FW because they should know. Very funny is the fact that they say "don't use FOC" or not longer than 10 seconds :joy: but when you look at the manual FOC is an own chapter! But from my experience I know how they perform (or better not perform) in FOC, have tried it once. Now I use high quality V4.12 in FOC without problems. I bought 4 cheap V4.12 first until I realized that I lost my money because of buying cheap!

Thanks for all the invaluable advice, will be sure to check to see if it's buggy when I get it. So FOC will still not work after a full FW update. Does anyone know the actual reason for this??

Also, if I want to get a good quality VESC that will run with FOC, which are the reputable suppliers?

Also where do I find release info on the new VESC Tool "without STLink - once released"

Is the Flier VESC from Alien Power Systems any good?

Got Greenmotion Vesc.
had to install the bootloader using ST-Link and after that reinstalled the FW to fix the Current Ramp bug.
Running it with BLDC mode and it works just fine, didn't try FOC but heard it's not recommended.

The maytech/greenmotion has minimum parts only. You need better quality with modified and upgraded parts then it will work. In europe I recommend @esk8 (esk8.de) where I bought mine. Just for info I've tried FW 2.18, 2.54 and 3.26 with maytechs in FOC (at home only), everytime hitting the brake (even with no load) the vesc cut off and show up DRV fault. 17 times braking = 17 DRV faults and no braking possible, that's bad!

maytech vescs are garbage. Their motors are good but the vescs are useless for anything over 10S and only do 10S for a little while before they burn.

Well I am only going to be running on 8S for now, however would be nice to be able to run VOC and tryout bleeding edge stuff without fear of things going bang. Thinking  I might try and return the item and buy something of better quality.

Can anyone recommend the VESC from proto boards?

If by harder you mean they find it difficult to pay a couple cents more for higher quality components and maybe pay a little more attention to how things fail and adjust their processes accordingly, then yes. So much harder. They're doing none of that. The parts fail because of greed, not because China can't produce amazingly high quality parts. Nothing is keeping maytech parts from being Ollin or AXLE quality other than they have deliberately decided to fully maximize profits at the customer's expense. 

So yeah, its a lot harder to not make quite as much money and instead produce a higher quality product when your only mission is to maximize profits by impregnating the market with quick selling garbage that people buy after doing zero research due to the fact that they can barely contain their excitement over building a board.

I have the question out to Frank and Ben on the VESC-Project forum.  Asking when the new VESC Tool will be released to the public.  I'll let you know what they say.

It's worth the wait folks...

Yes, they certainly can. But my point is there's a lot less to fuck up with a motor than with the vesc. They need to understand their lack of attention and using low quality parts are not going to work, but how can they when they don't even test their own product in the real world themselves in china?

It's either greed or ignorance, and based on your impressions, it's greed. Either way, they need to get heir shit together.

Well, I went the expensive route after a frustrating search about what components might be best.
I must say, there is allot of conflicting information available in this forum.

1. many mention VESC is not meant to be used for mountain boards, Chinese or not
2. many mention that regular ESCs are crap in general/they burn/cannot stand up to the abuse

Conclusion. Not a single ESC/VESC is suitable for mountain boards. :rage:
Anyway, I hope the focbox type VESCs will save my bacon when going up and down hill/8 km trips.

You went the right route @telnoi   :wink:
I'm using dual V4.12 from esk8.de (soon switching to 1.1 controller) and am very happy with the quality and performance. I run them on my mountainboard (and also was afraid because noone recommends it for mountainboard as you said). The performance is great (sensored FOC) for riding. I've never tried ESC but I think with ESC you get more raw power if you want to ride as crazy like @Nowind or want wheelie action. But for me the V4.12 are just fine!

Good to hear. I ordered the 1.1 controller mainly due to the enclosure and better protection agains the elements.

Additionally you get less heat problems and there are many added components and they should deliver more power, too. It's always best to buy quality stuff even when you can't afford it because in the end you buy the cheap plus the quality one.

So I received my VESC and I can confirm that it does have the buggy firmware. I would like to try and make it stable by updating it to Ackmaniac fireware and BLDC tool.

When I try and upload from the firmware tab, it seems to be working correctly. but when it finishes upload it crashes Ackmaniac BLDC tool, and on restart it says "the connected vesc has too old firmware..." again.

I have also tried uploading Ackmaniac firmware via the standard BLDC tool and although it does not crash and says upload complete, it does not seem to work with the same problem on restart.

I am guessing that it must be a problem with the bootloader or lack of one? It just seems strange that it goes through the process without error, and says upload complete. I have attached a video of this for example.

Can anyone confirm what is going wrong and what I need to do to fix this? Purchase a ST-Link V2?

And no bootloader that's why you can't upload FW. You can upload the bootloader with ST-Link V2 or wait for the new VESC Tool where it's just one click :grin:, should be released very soon.

If you want to use the V4.12 with buggy FW then set the current ramp step to 0.004 and then write configuration (after that the value stays at 0.04 as long as you don't read or write configuration again).
