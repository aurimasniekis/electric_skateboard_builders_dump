Hey Guys!
I'm going to build a 10s12p pack for a friend's gecco 1300W electric skateboard and the only thing I don't know it which bms I should order for that big pack!
Thinking about using those cells: https://www.nkon.nl/de/sony-us18650vtc6.html

Is a 10s80A bms to low for thst big pack? 
Would it be better if I'm going to order a 100A or 150A bms? 

Greetings,

For a big pack smart bms is a no brainer. You really wanna know how p groups are doing

Man, could you and @AlanZhou help me understand why youâ€™re making such a big battery? All that extra weight; whatâ€™s the benefit? Like, whatâ€™s the application? Seems like less an Esk8 more a train engine. Not hating, just struggling to understand. Help a slow brother out. ðŸ¤ª

Fair, on a pneumatic setup? Could you not achieve that with less than 2/3â€™s of that battery? Picking up a board is cumbersome with a 40-50 cell battery. Canâ€™t imagine how uncomfortable itâ€™ll be with a 13s10p. But I could be wrong. Youâ€™ll be the one to prove it.

Also, would really like to know the real world range on that bad boy. Youâ€™ll be able to cruise to the next state!
