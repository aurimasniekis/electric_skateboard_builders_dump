it doesn't come with firmware so it will be un-tested and probably has no upgrades 
So maybe not the best option.
I would recommend  getting a vesc from Chaka. http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/products
They come with firmware loaded and tested and they have the important upgrades and a warranty.
Or you can order from http://goaxle.com
They also come tested with firmware, upgrades and warranty and are still only $110

Still, $143 for an upgraded, programed, tested and warranteed Vesc is a bargain and well worth the extra.
