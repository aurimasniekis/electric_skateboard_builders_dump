Says Raptor 2.0 in the title (I miss these often when jumping into a thread from notifications).  Looks like lots of solder thrown on top of a wire but yah not flowed into it to me, probably fed solder into the iron instead of getting the wire hot enough to flow the solder into it directly.

Update @barajabali offered to send me a set of wheels and the newest version of r-spec hubs as compensation, as my current hubs also have issues after only barely being ridden. Will update on when i get motors and wheels. Hopefully no more gut-wrenching faceplants. 


Also hopefully will get the wheels and motors in the year of 2019.

This is the e-tray

![Screenshot_20190809-070305__01__01|225x500](upload://swOWkHgaD4QU6RSSr2DeqOnwzhE.jpeg) 

But it's it's not the e-tray. What it is though, is the bms probably shit out and isn't working. There's been many times this has happened to others.

Just wait until your motors lock up. You'll hate that issue even worse.

Also is it just the plastic cover?

```
BMS=Battery Management System

The e-tray is the plastic cover. Which I why it's really weird for Enertion to tell you your issues are cause by the e-tray. The e-tray has nothing to do with why your board isn't charging. The BMS is the issue here. Enertion will say anything to hold off it's customers. Be aware of that.

Ok so here is my problem, I have a issue where I am trying to charge my Raptor 2.1, I will have the board and the charging brick are both plugged in and the icon to verify that the board is charging isn't there. Further more the light on the charging brick should change red to verify that it is charging is not red but green, thus expressing it is not charging.

After looking at some forms and videos, I took apart  the raptor and I don't see any problems.(nothing looks broken)
So I am hoping I can find more information in what I can do.

Yo man, better don't say what you don't know, you giving wrong info.
The e-tray is not the enclosure, is where all electronics rest, ESC, switch, led screen, charging port and BMS

[/quote]

Exactly. It's two pieces. Top and bottom. I've owned a few R2's. I'm pretty sure I know what it is. ;) 

If you think the e-tray is why his board isn't charging. You might want to think about it for a few. Unless you actually think it's the plastic that's causing it?

My point being that the plastic pieces (e-tray or enclosure) isn't this issue at hand.

You'd have to get it from Enertion. Unless someone's selling R2 parts around here. The e-tray is just the part that is attached to the deck itself. The electronics are attached to it. But that's not going to fix the issue you're having. You need them to replace your BMS if it isn't charging correctly.

I had the same problem with my raptor 2.1. I got a replacement e-tray from @barajabali .
I parted out my Raptor but I still have the BMS. I can send it to you. Note: Chargingport and powerbutton is no longer there  only the BMS.

[/quote]

Bara no longer works for Enertion....actually no one on the forum works there so I would say no etray can be had anymore unless Enertion survives whatever financial issues they are going through.

If your problem is with the etray which is basically the BMS and switch, you can go the DIY route, but making it fit into that space and using the existing Raptor 2 holes would be tricky. @barajabali am I right?

You'll have to use something like this to house the the port, button and LCD

I got used bms from Bara but something is still not right. After turning on the light on charger blinked red several times and then back to green, no charging. Any ideas?
