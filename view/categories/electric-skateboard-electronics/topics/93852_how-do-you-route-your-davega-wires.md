I'd like to see what people have done to get the wires from their DAVEga to their VESC, especially for bottom mounted enclosures. Please show some pics.

Same here, I'll take pictures once I have everything reassembled.

I don't have any pictures of mine I'm afraid, but I routed out a channel on my Trampa deck using a regular wood router and drilled through the truck end.
I then layed in 6 core cable and hot glued it over the top.

Did you route the channel on the top or on the bottom side of the deck?

Under side, and drilled through where the truck mounts.

No one shows pics. :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

Mine comes out the bottom of my davega case through a small 5 pin connector. There is a hole drilled in the deck for the wires just in the middle of the truck bolts. There is a hole on my riser for the cable to exit. Then goes around the battery via a usb cable I hacked up, to a 6s balance connector in the enclosure just before the vesc.

There is a 6s balance connector just before the vesc because I had previously removed all the connectors on my vesc in a waterproofing crusade. Id like to change to the smaller connector like near the davega but really have no good reason to other than looks.

This is the best pic I have right now. I'll get some more soon. I just drilled a hole in the top of the deck where the truck mounts. Cut a line in a riser and done.

Ive wired mine with a hacked usb cable for shielding soldered direct to davega side with a connector streight to the vesc and ran it quite crudely up the side of the board. As its an off road board kind of goes with the rugged theme ![20190515_175526|666x500](upload://oycgG7uJgnX4zDco6f2cA7OC1MF.jpeg) ![20190515_175517|666x500](upload://xwmSAPGaNOFUpYpUhHIAHsruCrm.jpeg) ![20190515_175449|666x500](upload://k3FrFR9BjgC2UBw3xgrIb5Q9yHr.jpeg)

On a side note just got another davega working on a new scooter project. Wiring not complete yet though![20190515_175552|666x500](upload://lVJvdjeGjyCVrcyWHsitDcjDXAY.jpeg) ![20190515_175600|666x500](upload://54Qyka6dsKkpdWaJnn9knEJpprR.jpeg) ![20190515_175606|666x500](upload://aW49iHGBEFAPzBrmTdjObGEOkGv.jpeg) ![20190515_175615|666x500](upload://8yddqis003qcd8DOE3PI3sqe2CJ.jpeg)

Mine is almost the same as @pookybear except just heat shrink inside the enclosure and braiding outside. And I skirted the edge of the battery instead of straight over top.
