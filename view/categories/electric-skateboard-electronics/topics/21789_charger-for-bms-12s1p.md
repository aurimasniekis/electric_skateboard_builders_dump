for 12s Lipo or Li-ion the full charge voltage is 50.4v
you will need to match that with your charger.

If current charging rate can go up to 10a should I try to max it out? or go to like 8?

I recommend charging at 1C. 
For Lipos that’s 1x amp hour or capacity. 
For Li-ions you’ll have to find out the  cells charge rate and multiply by number of cells in parallel.
