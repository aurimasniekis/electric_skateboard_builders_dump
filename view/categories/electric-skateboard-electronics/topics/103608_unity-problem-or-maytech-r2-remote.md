Hello, i wanted to made a custom esk8. I use 10s5p, neptune 15 bms, unity and r2 remote (updated version) from maytech.

The problem is that on full brake sometimes doesn't brake (it's hard to explain because english is not my first language), so i uploaded a video for someone who have time to take a look and know what's about.

Thank you !

Can you post a screenshot of your motor configuration settings?

Most members here are more active at https:/forum., including the developer of the unity.
