Any-one know the exact part no and source for the 11 pin BMS plug used on Evolve GT boards. It has a 2.0mm pitch . Looking to use on a DIY build.

I couldn't find an exact match when making my custom battery. But I came across plenty of small 11 pin connectors.

There will be an exact match on Digikey but it'd take me an hour to find it.  If someone REALLY needs the exact match that badly, PM me or look on digikey

Don't forget sometimes the connectors and the metal thingies inside them are two separate parts

I didn't manage to find the correct connector unfortunately.

I had to get them made up locally at quite an expense! :confused:

Ahh ok... yeah I used some jst 11pin 2.0mm connectors, you would just have to shave‚Äôem down some it‚Äôll be a little snug which is good bc they don‚Äôt have locks like the original... worked for me..ü§ôüèæ

Can confirm, these do indeed work on the Bamboo GT BMS at least!  They're not an exact match so they don't quite lock but they do fit quite snugly.

After i couldn't accept that this plug just doesn't exist and that Evolve actually designed it just for their BMS i decided to try one last time and put all my effort in. Get ready for very good news in 3, 2, 1...
I found the exact plug on [Taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=538374319897&spm=1101.1101.N.N.fcecee4). 
As of today i can confirm that it fits like it should with a very satisfying ''click''.

Trying to find 11 core ribbon cable to suit without having to buy 100 metres of it!

If you pay the shipping, i can send you some. I ordered them through taobao agent. I can't remember how the website is called.
Edit: [Link](http://www.superbuy.com)

@Wizeartz i will have to check for the thickness.

Thanks Rok, I found some in Australia, so I'm all sorted. They fit well enough! I think 22AWG is the gauge for the BMS. Nobody can tell me where the BMS wires are for reading the voltage only, or for charging/balancing the cells too...
