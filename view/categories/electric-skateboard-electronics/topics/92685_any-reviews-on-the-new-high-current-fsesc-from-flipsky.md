So has anyone tried the new High Current FSESC from flipsky, and know if its any good ?  200Amp sounds almost to good to be true....

Well even if its true a single motor cant take all those amps

I see it being used for electric gokarts and efoils they have much bigger motors.

Supposedly its just a regular vesc 6.6 with more fets for more current.

It doesn't look like the heatsink is a good fit if they are using such thick silicone pads:

I was thinking if you had larger motors that could then this would be more fitting? The 80100 APS ones can handle 150a but that is the most I have seen, but if you even manage to supply that much power for an eskate I am not sure if anyone could handle it lol - I am guessing it would fly out from beneath you with a slight touch of the throttle without massively slow acceleration curves and the traction would be a large issue. Hopefully one day someone gets a high discharge battery + 2 80100 APS motors 150a (or better) + 2 200a flipsy escs and run this set up - I think that would be possible but overkill, right?

I would think that for like gokarts or thottle EVs would use like ebike ESCs that have a higher amp limit like 300a for higher powered ones,  but RC escs like remotes for EV like efoil or eskate, I'm probably wrong though

If you need something that powerful I'd step up to a quality E-bike controller from ASI. Their new BAC 2000 would work great!

Is it still the same shunt value? The current sensors saturate at +- 165A on the regular vesc hardware.
