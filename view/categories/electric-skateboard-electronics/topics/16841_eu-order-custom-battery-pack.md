I will be ordering batteries in the next group buy which could be like 3-4 weeks from now, so the wait is long :( and I dont think anyone in europe makes batteries as a service on the forum.

Maybe @TarzanHBK

If you are really in a rush.. I could suggest you one ebike battery builder.. he might 'rig it up'' for you.. not sure about bms.. but he can spot weld, heatshrink, solder up the battery.. wont say he is the cheapest.. but if you are in hurry, he might help you out..

His origin of country: Poland

he seems to be a bit pricy.. but you can ask anyways.. ;)

also depends on what cells you use.. but I think he charged 1 eur per cell.. so to weld up 24 cells would be about 24 eur extra.. not so sure about the packaging / wiring and all of that..
