Hard to say but I wouldnâ€™t take the risk.

The risk being that these things are factory set.  No programming is possible and they make 2 versions 1 for belts and 1 for hubs.  They are not interchangeable.  You can use the belt esc with a mountain board set up but they're pretty underwhelming.

If possible get the beefy ones from diyeboard site..

I had to run of them as single drive with a bit more aluminium as heatsink (not the beefy one) and it got extremely hot.

It works ok, power is somewhat limited (i get only about 1200w but otherwise works good)

So when running dual should be somewhat ok
