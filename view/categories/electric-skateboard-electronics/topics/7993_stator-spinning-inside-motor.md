HI All,

I got back my board on Thursday and took it out for a test ride today. It's got the enertion r-spec motors, and I noticed that one of the motors doesn't have any torque. specifically, it looks like the stator is moving since the copper coils were spinning when I hit the throttle. Anyone have a suggestion on what I should do to proceed?

This happened to a lot of people. Including me
Bad batch of rspecs.
I emailed Enertion with no response but that's fine it's an easy fix

Agree with both @Michaelinvegas (definitely don't ride it) and @barajabali (it's pretty easy to fix). Same thing happened to me. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f398af29cdb642524aa5cd4c3fd8dc12e0cdd8f7.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7dee6d7e36f6d256ec0f378e2e2ea0726604557f.jpeg" width="375" height="500">
Stator actually came off when I tried removing the can...you can see it also shredded some of the phase wires...that's what happens if you try riding it while the stator can move. I used JB Weld to resecure stator to the baring tube, good to go so far.
