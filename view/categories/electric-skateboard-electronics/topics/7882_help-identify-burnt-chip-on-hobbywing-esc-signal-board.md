Around last week, I accidentally shorted the three signal cables to my old HobbyWing ESC and it went up in smoke. It still works, just not the receiver (it took that out with it).

I opened it up and found one chip which was obliterated. The other components around it look burned, but it may just be from the smoke. I believe if I can identify that destroyed part and replace it, it should be fixed, because that's the only component that looks burned.

If replacing any components will fix it, I will likely buy them. I only need this fixed for the moment so I can use it on campus before my replacement VESC gets here.
