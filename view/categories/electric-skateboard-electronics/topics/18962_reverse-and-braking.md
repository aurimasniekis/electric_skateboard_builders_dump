So I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to Electric Skateboards mand I know I can either have my motor: 
•Forward and Reverse 
OR
•Forward and Brake (with regenerative braking?)

What's the best option?
And also I wasn't sure but if I were to use reverse as a brake, it could ruin the motor? Any help would be great and any further info would be appreciated.

Just stay with forward and brake and you will have no problems

Forward with regen braking is best
Trying to use reverse for braking might be dangerous
Reverse is a novelty, not a practical mode.
Probably the most worthless thing about boosted boards.
