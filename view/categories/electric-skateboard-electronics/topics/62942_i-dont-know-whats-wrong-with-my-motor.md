Hey guys, Ive been itching to ride recently BC my area is completely drenched, so I went to make sure everything is all good with my board and I notice some weird cogging when im rolling to towards me...

I turn it on and as i was recording the sound it was making for you guys, it actually shot out a little fragment of.... something? Im really dissapointed this motor have only lasted about 2 months(May 22nd) of little use. Ive only ridden about 80km (10km before BT module and almost 70 after) :( 

is it toast?

heres the video where you can actually see and hear it shoot out the sparks and everything else it does.... :cry:

edit: just to be clear, Ive only ridden in mildly damp terrain ONCE(What I meant to say was that this wet riding thing happened while ago, and its performed perfectly since.... so i doubt thats why its doing this all of a sudden :( ) , and I took care to dry everything out and make sure its a happy camper... and before it ran like a dream!

Please dont use it anymore - If a fragment shoots out, it can really fuck something up in your surrounding.

Our Outrunners we use are most of the time well made, not much difference on each one and all pretty robust.
But not each one is perfect and some just have a loose magnet inside - looks like you got one of the bad ones.
Could also be that this is one of @longhairedboy ´s early FireworkFucknDopeMotor prototypes.

In each case, just contact him and he´ll sort you out i´m sure ;)

Send the damaged motor back and i'll see what i can do. I don't currently have any in stock but maybe we can work something out. 

You didn't drop it or throw it or let your rabid ocelot play with it or anything right?

Also, please include that mystery peice of whatever it is that you have in your hand that came out of the motor. 

whetever happens, we'll work it out. But i absolutely need that damaged motor and definitely whatever fragments you find of it.

Well in that case, the warranty is void. I'm sorry, but i simply can't cover Acts of Ocelots.

Ive never dropped, thrown or abused it outside of the "normal usage" range :slight_smile:

Ill get that shipped out to you asap, and ive bagged whatever other little pieces I can find

Looks like your motor lost a filling, you need to see the dentist or LHB

i don't recognize that chip of whatever, its possible its a chunk of sensor.  I've fully disassembled several of these motors. They're not exactly built shitty, so i'm expecting to find evidence of a manufacturing fail. 

I have motors that are still running fine that look like they have been tied to the back of a car with a long piece of string and dragged behind it all the way to Seattle, and this is the first one i've ever seen fail in this way. Very intrigued.

no clue :man_shrugging:

the most violent thing this motor has endured was the shock of my mount coming loose after I had finished breaking to a stop, and even then the motor barely kissed the ground... the mount took most of it

Isn't that suppose to be one of your exclusive feature... If not you might wanna think about implementing it, sound like it could be use to summon lord Skatan

its kind of ironic that it happened this way, ive been having this reoccuring dream where I trade my wheels for the ones that spark when you do a slide or something like it.... :man_shrugging:

no slides here though :frowning:

you try opening the motor and looking inside?  probably just has some iron stuck to a magnet.  Id open it and stick duct tape to everythin in the bell and see what you can pull off.   beats all the trouble of sending it back for him to likely do the same.  thats what it sounds like from the video

if it was just sounding like that then I might.... even though I have no clue how to open the motor up. Ill leave this one to LHB, he knows way more than I do :laughing:

its super easy to open the motor.  take the pulley off and then you can see under it there's a c-clip holding the motor together, take that off with a screw driver or something twisting it and expanding it enough to get it off the shaft, dont lose it when it shoots off, then when its off you can pull the whole bell part off the base part that has the wires attached.  theres' magnet resistance but maybe 5lbs or 10 and you can pull it off.  careful putting it back.  
 totally not worth sending back until you check that.

if that broken motor pulley is really well aligned the belt shouldnt hit the flange and it should still be fine to use i think

Yes, but those are still experimental. Generating a gravimetric field strong enough to trigger a singularity through which our dark lord may pass into this realm is difficult when you only have maybe 70 watts continuous to work with.

everybody stop what you're doing and check your local tool stores for this. I got mine at autozone. Its a gear puller and it not only fits the bor for most motors it can also be cranked with your skate tool.

You need much more heat than a hear dryer. I use a Map gas torch for about for about 15 seconds waving it heating the pulley evenly and it's good but you can use a heat gun but even that takes some.time to get it hot enough.

is it unsafe to heat this paint? I should probably do it outside :laughing:

Heat it from and angle from the side and try to only hit the pulley with the flame. I've done this with CF enertion mounts several times and they were never damaged.
