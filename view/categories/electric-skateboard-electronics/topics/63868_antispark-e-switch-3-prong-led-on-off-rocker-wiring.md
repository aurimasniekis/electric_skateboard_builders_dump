```
I know it’s probably so simple, but how do I wire my 3-prong rocker switch to my antispark e-switch? I have 4-wires coming off e-switch (R,B,W,Y), how do I attach to rocker (it had one copper prong and 2 silver prongs).
I currently just have the red and white wire connected to the rocker and it works but doesn’t light up the led on the rocker. Should I hook up the yellow and black? Where? 
Thanks in advance
