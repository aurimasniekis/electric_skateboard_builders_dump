Hello, first I don't know what category this should be, but I think a lot of people want to know the medium price for Bestech's bms, I really want to know (6s specially).

Another thing is this cables on the photo! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/7/27811ee73ca49b6336377a07810d9c8e9481ed08.jpg" width="450" height="338">
I think it is for a switch, but man, I already have a Anti Spark Switch (That was really expensive) and I don't want to use the BMS one, so I put that wires together?

I thinkâ€‹ each was $55 or so not including shipping.

Those cables are not for a switch, they are for a thermistor as shown.
