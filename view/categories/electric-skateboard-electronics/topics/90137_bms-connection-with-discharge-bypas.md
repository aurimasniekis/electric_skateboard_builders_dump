Just wanna make sure I'm doing it right before I make any board-frying mistakes... I want to use my bms for balancing and charging, but not discharge. ![bmsconn|553x338](upload://ooGSraugeQYDhMXP2zUPy8sIaG0.png)   
There is no brand name on the bms but here's the provided schematic from ebay: ![bmsche|618x364](upload://m2LmALC2dClYWqOnB3XXRKqoPpg.png)

Basically connect your bms to your battery like normal, then just connect your load directly to the battery terminals. i dont get your diagram lol

That looks identical to my board. What didn't you understand about my diagram? Maybe I can make it clearer.

Your diagram is correct.
Make sure you solder the B- wire before plugging in the balance connector.
