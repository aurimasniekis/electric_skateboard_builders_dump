Everytime I try to plugin my mini-usb this keeps happening to me. Anyone else have this issue?

:grin: Try to do the same on top of a high ladder, that will solve your issue:

And this might prevent "problems" in the future:

@Jtag thanks for the help! Can you look over my diagram to make sure I'm doing it correctly?

Also, the contraceptives, I'm guessing I apply them after doing motor detection? Will they work in FOC mode too?
