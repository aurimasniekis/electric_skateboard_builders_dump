I purchased the equivalent of a hoverboard charge like this one:

I was wondering if anyone knows what is the mating male connector for this plug. A direct link would be great.

sorry my last post was wrong i misunderstood.  
Here i found a link for what you need
http://www.amazon.com/Segmart-Replacement-Charging-Balance-Hoverboard/dp/B01AMWY7A4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1452867386&sr=8-3&keywords=hoverboard+charging+port
might be able to find it cheaper if you look

I sell hoverboards so this is easy stuff. if you need anymore parts from them let me know i have one im parting out for cheap.

Hey man, did you ever get this to work? If so how did you connect the wiring? I have one and can't figure out how to figure out which wire is positive and which is negative.
