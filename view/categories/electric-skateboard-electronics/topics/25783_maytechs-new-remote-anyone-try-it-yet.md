looks really nice and has a bunch of nice things going on but most important to me I wonder how well can it modulate brakes and throttle?

looks like a steez?  Curious on details - BT or 2.4 or ... ?  

Riding in the city a lot of interference, so i love the GT2b for frequency hopping, but not always the prettiest handheld.  I have a baby buffalo enclosure to try next for GF who likes thumb throttle better.

Awesome! Thanks @psychotiller. I recently bought a raptor v1 w/ a Winning remote, but the remote is too damn touchy. I definitely like the option of 2 speed settings in the new Maytech remote, so I won't have to eat pavement anymore. I just ordered
