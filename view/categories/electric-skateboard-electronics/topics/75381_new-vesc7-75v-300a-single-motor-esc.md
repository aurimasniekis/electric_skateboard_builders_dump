Anyone seen this?

Probably too expensive for esk8 though.

Overkill for boards. We did some test lasts weekend. 450A in the power stage at 40Khz switching frequency, FOC.
This is more for things needing big power.

I can tell you that it will foil very well.
The tests we did last weekend made Benjamin a very happy man. The motor we used is best described as a short circuit. Windings resemble a 25cm AWG 12 cable.

This thing catapults VESC directly into e-bike territory guys. I know there are forks with super high power but this one with compact package is a good thing IMO :wink:
@trampa wish you fair sales on this, it can only expand Ben's work in a good way. Still hope it wasn't this expensive, I'd like to compare it with similarly priced e-bike controllers (performancce wise).

why 3 battery inputs and 3 output wires per phase? is it to keep the cables more flexible while limiting the current per cable/connector?

Typo, 75V 300A. I will Change that today.

Three cables allows us to use thin and flexible cable. If we would push 300A through one cable and one connector, things would get bulky.

we also see Jenso getting some more affordable 16s 200A vesc, where a dual is cheaper than a single.

No, you can't. It would be great if it was like that but reality is unfortunately different. 
Development cost of such an ESC is way bigger. The logic stage is more complex and more expensive, more assembly costs, a lot more FETs, lower volume in production, bigger casing, bigger PCBs with more copper in them, more capacitors, cables and connectors. It all ads up and works out expensive.

I was commenting on the arc one and why they might have been able to reduce the cost. To be fair they started pretty high. I doubt you could get this small profile any less expensive.

For a single motor only. This is a very beefy VESC delivering true 350A peak. If we would have used single pair cables you can imagine how thick and stiff they would have been. The thinner wires are easy to bend and consume less space.

I'm confused how this VESC is supposed to work.   It's good for one motor, so why is there three cables for each phase.  What motor would you connect it to that has three cables per phase?  I've read the thread and saw some vague answers, but perhaps someone can explain how this works in more detail please?

Yes, I already said in my comment I've read the thread, but didn't really get how that was supposed to work.

All it says it they did that so the cables wouldn't be so crazy thick and bending wouldn't be a problem.  It doesn't say anything about any motors it'll hook up to.

## \#46 Posted by: AlexBE Posted at: 2018-11-23T02:02:55.206Z Reads: 189

You're over-thinking it. It's just three wires in parallel per phase to increase the current capacity. So instead of connecting one wire from ESC to motor phase 1, you connect 3 wires. Exactly the same concept as overhead power transmission lines, ever noticed how they have multiple parallel wires strung between the towers? So instead of 3 wires, they have 3 sets of 2? That is because single thicker cables can't be rolled up onto small cable reels.

I'm not sure if it has been said already, but I could seriously see this ESC being used in combat robotics. I read some threads on other forums a while ago where they were looking for high power ESC's with VESC capabilities.

Plus with big competitions unit cost isn't that important when the robots are already tens of thousands of dollars.

The problem about big cables is that they are stiff and consume space since the minimum bending radius is big. Three thinner wires in parallel are less space consuming and the device can also be kept a lot flatter (18mm only).
On the input side we have one power cable per motor phase. Again, thin wires small bending radius, less space consumed. Also the PCB needs to carry less current if you have multiple attachment points. We do not need to run 300A over the PCB, since the battery cables attach directly to the power stages of each motor phase. It looks funny, but technically it is a very capable, compact and simple design. 
At 300A you really want to avoid that the PCB sees a lot of this high current. Everything in the power stage is kept short and is condensed to the very max. The cooler the device runs, the more power you can push.

You also get a higher cooling area per cross section. Question is also how the batteries for such a monster look like, if you want to use full power for more than some minutes. I would suggest to bind 6 plugs together to connect to 3 batteries which are coupled on every cell level by balancers and make an intermediate star point to share the loads.

God damn that thing is a beast Frank! @trampa  

Correct me if I'm wrong but I see 3 sets of motor wires on this. Can you program multiple on one like a unity? Second question, 75amp continuous, is there a higher burst amp on that or is it just solid at 75? Would be great for a race board!

It’s one controller for one motor only.
The load is just split to multiple wires.
You can’t run multiple motors like the unity.
It’s 75V not 75a 😉

multiperson longboard would work. E-foil, gocart, even a electric motorcycle/moped. but using the 22500W of power on a board..it dont see an application for it for general use...Just the weight of this application an a board.. xD just no.
