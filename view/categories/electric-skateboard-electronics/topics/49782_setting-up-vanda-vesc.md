I am trying to set up my VESC from Vanda and it is not updating the firmware. I am following the proper steps but when I reconnect the VESC, it just tells me that my firmware is outdated. Any help?

You probably need a boot loader if it won't flash. Just search boot loader and you'll find plenty of info.

Use ackmaniacs tool instead if you can't, don't try to bench run the motors much. that blew the drv8302 chip on both my vandas, focbox just shrugged it off
