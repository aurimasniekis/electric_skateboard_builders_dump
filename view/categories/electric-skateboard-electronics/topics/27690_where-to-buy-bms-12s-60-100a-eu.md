Hey I am wondering where I can buy a 12S BMS with the CELL WIRES that are around 13 CM x 6 CM. 
I want it fast so I can pay for express shipping, so where can I buy one?

I live in Norway and prefer to buy one from the close countries like UK.
I don't want to buy from batterysupport because the shipping is slow.

Thanks. Sander.

That will almost be impossible I think. I live in Sweden and I ordered a bms from batterysupport yesterday and it will take about 2-4 weeks. Haven't seen a legit reseller in europe yet :O

You can go with DHL which would be 8-17 days for me too :) 
Send them an email on their website, they respond very fast. (2h for me)

Thought so,
Thanks anyway ;)

The shipping is so much cheaper on the AliExpress then their own website. (42 USD Cheaper)

I know, I asked them about it and they said the price on the website was wrong when clicking "estimate shipping".

Well I thought they could reply to emails to when they can do this:
"Items will be shipped out in 24-48 hours (excluding weekend or holidays)."

Just found my answer:
"Balance Connector will send together with the BMS."
