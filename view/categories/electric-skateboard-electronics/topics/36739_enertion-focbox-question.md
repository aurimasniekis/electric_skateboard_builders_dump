Hello guys, 

I'm trying to hook up a bluetooth module to the CAN bus of my FOCBOX. Does anybody know what the male connector on the FOCBOX is? I think it's a JST but I'm not sure which model of JST connector. Thanks!

I think it should be connected to UART port, Can is for connecting two Focboxes together. I might be wrong.... 

Connector is JST 2.0mm PH. I donâ€™t remember how many pins there are. Just count them and get appropriate connector lenght.
