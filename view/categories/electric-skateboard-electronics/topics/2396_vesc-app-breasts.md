Time to thank @jacobbloy for his time and effort developing the VESC APP

He has shelled out a good few thousand, so far, and cost of an Apple developer account is further outlay – so give him a bit of support, buy the guy a beer.

What’s $10, a couple of pints?

It’s easy, go to his site, a pop up appears, click donate, done. [LINK TO SITE](http://vesc.net.au/)

Add your name to this list when done:-
