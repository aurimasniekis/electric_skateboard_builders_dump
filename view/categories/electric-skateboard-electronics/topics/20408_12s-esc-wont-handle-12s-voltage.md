I switched the voltage from 12s to 10s and 8s and back to 12s and it only every does jerky movement after riding it for a min on 12s - it will just lurch or not want to go past a certain speed - I can take a video but I am sure someone has an answer to my regular 12s ESC problem?

You forgot to tell us what ESC you are using.
It sounds like it might be overheating though.

Ya they all look the same but it looks like the same one the JLabs and Dexter sell

thats normally a maytech 12s ESC, they tend to stop working sometimes..

They tend to run a little hot as well. 
I ran a pair of those on 12s with Carvon motors and didn't have the problem your having. 
I got mine from Dexter.

I burned up the only maytech VESC I've ever owned. I also burned up a Flyer VESC.
