NO, that is a fire risk.

If the male is 5.5mm x 2.1mm then the female needs to be 5.5mm x 2.1mm

If the male is 5.5mm x 2.5mm then the female needs to be 5.5mm x 2.5mm

because i couldn't find the answer, and is faster asking you than search. ( i make always my search, but not a clear answers).

And will help future builders, when they search.
