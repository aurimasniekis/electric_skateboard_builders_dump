I was wondering if someone could help me look at my settings and board read out to help me understand what’s going on and what I should change?

The results from a short ride

The problem is when I start on a minor slope and I try to floor the remote, the motors stutter and then eventually cut out.

But if I have a rolling start, they work fine

This board runs a Sanyo 10s2p with 6374 motors and flipsky 3.40 dual vesc

The 4.20 suffers under strain. Have you read all the threads surrounding it?

Mike seems to have found a way to use it, I personally abandoned it

Thanks for the tip, once I turned it down to 30, no more cut outs.

For historical purposes, here are the new settings![image|281x499](upload://u8DJ7nq8eWUwwmd0cETRULRPxIB.jpeg) ![image|281x499](upload://5BDqHboYzs63tKbpfstbFBKAuba.jpeg)

That's great. How does it feel on those settings out of interest? Are you happy with torque?

It’s no where near the 12s4p setup I have but I knew the non 6.6 Flipsky’s didn’t really handle 12s.  It goes up rather steep hills at an ok speed.  Would like a little more power...I’m ok with it for now.
