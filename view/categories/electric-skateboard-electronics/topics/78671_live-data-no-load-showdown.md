Whatâ€™s your lowest wattage with no load on the bench?
5 watts at 7100erpm on foc
Strangely the current draw will drop at full 95% duty but on bldc no drop at full 95%![image|666x500](upload://4rjEmiriYCjVjQjo462Bjb8KP5e.jpeg)


This shows the drop from 94 to 95 percent duty

Interesting, does this info correlate with wattage when the motors are loaded or is it just a bit of fun

Theoretically hubs should be the lowest as there are no resistances like belts and chains

it shows the iron losses of the motor and how well the bearings spin or the drive system with belt.    Just curious what other motor losses are without the belt n pulley.    1000 rpm as a reference point.   foc shows lower losses.


when you don't have a dyno this is what you do.
