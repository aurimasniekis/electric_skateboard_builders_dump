@darkkevind 

Hi! I was wondering if it would be possible to **connect two 5000 mah 3s 20c batteries in parralel and two 4000 mah 5s 30c batteries in series**. Is this possible to achieve a 10,000 mah 10s 40c battery? 

Thanks!

That's really not a good idea

What would not work?

Is it just that you can't do that.

2 x 3s (p) is still only 3s

2 x 5s (s) would be 10s

You could series those two up for 13s but any other combination won't really work.

The problem is putting two 5000/20 batteries in series with two  4000/30 batteries because they have different capacity and discharge rates.   
They won't drain equally in series.

Cant connect a 10s ( (2) 5s in series ) to a 3s ( (2) 3s in parallel ). If im not loosing my mind the 10s would try to balance out with the 3s and the 3s will go bang and burn your house down :slight_smile:

Best bet is to ride them separately. But you may need to change your settings if your using a VESC. Ride with a 6S setup, Ride with a 10S setup.
