Anyone have trouble with the VESC being dead on arrival? I have 2 from Olin and the Enertion is terrible quality and doesn't even have a vinyl wrap on it with the Caps falling off.I have tried everything to have it fixed. 
I am completely disappointed from Enertion as my first order never received and I had to buy one from a community member. I was told that it was not their fault and have to go through my credit card company to get my money back.
Anyone know how i can diagnose or fix the VESC?

Some pictures and reasoning would help figure out your problems. What's working, what's not?
