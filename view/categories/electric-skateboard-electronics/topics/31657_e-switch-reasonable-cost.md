FYI.  Finishing up a rebuild and found that my e-switch wasn't working.  Searching for a esk8 specific switch had few options at a price I didn't want to keep hitting.  Another local esk8er pointed me to this:

Exact(?) duplicate to the one I bought for $60 elsewhere is $29 here at an e-cycle shop....

Have fun :wink:

@esk8 .de sells the Vedder switch for like 30â‚¬

Bestech bms comes with a free e-switch.
No one can beat that price.

Thanks! Ordered one. Pretty sure this is the same manufacturer as torqueboard's switch.

It's a disposable E-switch 
Use it once and throw it away.

@karma is right the Anti Spark key is a great cheap way of doing it as well. I also have a switch or two for sale right now and you can see more about that [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/boom-jda-ebsc-switch-boom-35-compact-mosfet-switch/26946).  Also the switch that you linked looks like a great deal for $29.

They also have a cheap watt meter that I've seen for 2x the price on other esk8 sites.  I came over from ebikes and have used luna cycle for a handful of purchases in the past w/o any issues.

these may or may not use appropriate mosfets. if they do they should be no problem.

my first torqueboards switch had no problem

@Jinra yeah I've been really wanting to take apart one of these style switches so I can figure out how they work, and why they fail. Though this one is so cheap I might just buy it and take it apart lol.

It's funny, the pre production model of the raptor 2 suffered the same common issue and got stuck in always on. I wonder if they fixed it for production.

The company in China that makes them may have switched (no pun intended) to a cheaper and inferior mosfet without any disclosure of said change

I use these by @goldenHusky.  They are 29â‚¬ or $35, depending on your location.  Tacking is $10-$19 depending on locationad tracking requirments.  Ive had no issus so far.

How do you connect a switch to operate the relay?

```
Not sure about @Jebe but I use a [on centre-off on] momentary rocker switch which delivers current to one or the other coil in my mechanical latching relay switch.
Current to one coil (momentarily) - makes the circuit (no spark), current to the other coil (momentarily) - breaks the circuit. Job done. I break the circuit in the negative pole.
```

## \#20 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-08-28T22:27:57.547Z Reads: 152

```
So any momentary switch would work. Like the momentary button switch that hover board uses?
This is very interesting.

I'm not familiar with those particular switches unfortunately, but yes, as long as the voltage delivered to the coil(s) are correct to the relay, any switch covering the voltage and amperage required to energise the coil will work.
```

Also with this kind of switch/relay you're not draining your main battery keeping the gate open all the while your board is on, like with a MOSFET....
```

```
The gate of a MOSFET is technically a very small capacitor and draws practically 0 current so you don't have to worry about that whatsoever. Actually energizing a relay coil draws far more current than a MOSFET gate, so yeah lol.

Am using the 6s connection from my BMS wiring to energise the switch - connection 3 +

As Jdog said, draws 0 amps when measuring with a DC ammeter.

popped my Vedder Anti spark in the first week - replaced the fets, it then worked once and popped again.
Those industrial solid state relays are robust. And a stocked item at work ;)

Update - the cheapo ebay ones both failed. $120 SSD from RS Components is still going strong after a month

Isnt this the same switch as torqueboards? The one that keeps constantly failing?

Hey, Ive been using SSR's for homebrewing for years, they are bulletproof.  Where exactly are you pulling your positive control lead from?  Im running a 10s4p, so at 42v I will overload the relay.  I was thinking about splitting the first bms lead (4.2v) to a switch then to the SSR.

This would work perfect for anything 8s and lower without having to knock down the voltage for the coil.

And this for slightly higher currents...

and these. Costly option though. When my cheap one failed it took my battery voltage down to 34 volts before I found it.
Another week and the cells may have been lost.
