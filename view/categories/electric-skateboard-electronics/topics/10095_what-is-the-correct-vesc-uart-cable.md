My understanding was the vesc's uart port needs is a JST 2.0mm 6 pin connector. So I ordered 30 of these:

And I got them yesterday and I found out today they are smaller and chubbier than the uart port, so they will not work. So anyone have any idea what is the right size?

I think we need a micro jst connector.
Does anybody have a good source for europe?
