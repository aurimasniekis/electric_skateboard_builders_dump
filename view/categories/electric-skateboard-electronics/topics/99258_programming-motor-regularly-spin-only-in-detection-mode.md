Hi to all the esk8 builders community!
I’m fresh to this and i’m At the final stage with a building.

Finally I’ve assembled my Esk8 and now I’m programming with Vesc tool.

But I think there is a problem with motor or maybe the VESC. 

During the Motor detection it spin regularly but after it in the detection “Success!" Dialog box Under the Sensor voice it is Sensorless but the motor is sensored and connected.

After it all the commands sent to the motor from Mac or input remote control  generate a motor noise like a fiiiiiiiiii some little movements and a stop.

Can you help me understand this problem ? Maybe is the motor’s sensor cable? Why the Vesc tool tell me it is sensorless after the detection wizard routine?

Thank you! So much!

Dani
