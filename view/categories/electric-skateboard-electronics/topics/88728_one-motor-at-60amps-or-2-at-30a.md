Hi guys! :slight_smile:

I need help from someone with more experience!

I have a board atm with a single 6374 190kv TB motor on it. I'm running a 12S3P battery pack with 30Q cells.

I'm thinking of adding a second motor to it, but.. Right now I have to limit my ESC at 60A from the battery as the pack can't handle more current. If I add a second motor I will have to limit the ESC's at 30A each. Right?

Do you think I will notice a difference or will it be the same apart from the added traction? I want some extra power for the steepest hills :sunglasses:

I know I should upgrade the battery pack also, but right now I'm on a tight budget as I'm studying for another year.

Thanks guys!

You will notice a difference going from one motor to two and yes you are correct in the assumption that you have to split the amp draw across both vescs.

Thanks for all the replies! I can't understand how the diffrence would be so dramatic with the same power tho'. But I will probably try it out and see :slight_smile:

Slightly off topic question. 

But would a for example 6374 motor ran on 40% load more efficient or a 5056 at 75% load

The 6374 would be cooler at least :slight_smile:

It would probably also last longer since it has to do less work

This. Lower temperatures also mean less power losses.

But you only split the "battery" current numbers, not the "motor" current numbers

First things first

Motor current â‰  Battery current

Right now you are using 60A on the motor and the battery

With two motors you will set 30A on each VESC but you can and should set 60A on each motor, this way you have 120A in the motor total, meaning you will have double the torque

Now to the catch, to limit the battery current to 30A, the VESC wont go above 50% duty cycle, what that means? In the hill that will require each motor to keep at 60A you will climb at half of your top speed for a given battery voltage

* If you can't climb some hill at 60A motor and battery, you will be able to climb it with dual motor

* If you can climb a given hill right now, you won't climb it faster by going dual motor

In the first case you would be torque limited, it doesn't matter at what speed, your motor at 60A simply doesn't have enough torque

In the second case you are power limited, and what constrains it is the battery max

Dual motors will give you more stability on full acceleration, you will feel safer and might ride with more confidence, braking two wheels is way more effective than a full brake on one wheel. Acceleration will be more powerful as you are already increasing efficiency on motors by reducing the current and accumulating less heat. 

Go for it and report back with your findings, thank us latter

30a is still alot of current.  You will notice huge difference in performance. I made a board that i teach other people to ride on and its dual 6355 set at 25a each. Its still way more power than most people can handle. Certainly more than a boosted.

I don't think I have ever drawn over 70A battery on my dual 6374 street setup with pneumatic tires and that is climbing some serious hills.

Welcome to the dark side :sunglasses:

I am  the same boat now.  I have a board running on a 6264 190kv motor with vesc setting of 50amps and I am thinking of switching it to 2x 5365 200kv.  I running 10s lipo so I think I can pull 70 to 80amp.  

Today while I was going up some hills  and I noted  that not have enough tractions is the problem with single drive system.  My single 6364 had enough power but it was slipping because lack of traction and perverting effective hill climb.

The snow here in the north of Sweden hasen't melted yet, but I went for a short ride today and recorded the VESC status.

With my single 6374 motor, the maximum amp draw from the battery pack was only 15A and the max motor amp was at 45A. With that knowledge I will surely throw another motor on there and check the difference :sunglasses:

Your measurements must be wrong....You must be very very light or you're very conservative on the trigger.

I'm 70 kilos myself almost same setup and drawing 35 bat amps max.

I would check to see if you have anything adding friction to the wheels (bad belt alignment something overtightened etc.) I typically get much lower amperage (I am light on the trigger and light weight, but still 35A on the battery is quite a bit unless you're gunning it/racing or hill climbing) <<-- granted this is a chill cruise to the convenience store and back but still got up to 16mph and at most 6.5A on the battery.  Would be curious to see your data (ideally elevation changes too since I think this plays a pretty big role but just acceleration/velocity vs amperage would be interesting too)

extra friction might be my suck ass bearings. need to replace those. Belt is aligned fine. I guess it could be slightly tighter. I draw many amps when I jam full throttle to top speed. But maybe it's my riding style too. I like to ride aggressively. I almost always ride on flats.

Yah I'm sure slamming the throttle I could get higher values, but generally speaking I'm just using the board for cruises similar to the one recorded to run to local stores not using it as a thrill ride, but different strokes for different folks and all, just wouldn't expect to get that high of draw when jumping on the board to go and riding flats for light riders (I also typically set some amp limit on the motor to avoid accidentally punching it out from under my feet, has happened once before, luckily just landed on my backpack and felt stupid for a minute).  Most ebikes are limited to 600W so really that's typically enough and at 15A with 50V it's 750W so it's enough power to keep you moving but really depends on how fast your accelerating what peaks you'll hit.

I just made an order for a second 6374 motor so I will keep you posted on the result :) I'll have to figure out how to make one VESC a master and the other a slave and things like that but I think it'll be alright! In one or two weeks I should have the parts so we'll see how it goes :sunglasses:

I got all my parts today but I have a problem..

My new VESC doesn't want to upgrade it's firmware. I did this last week on my old VESC and it was not a problem. But on the new VESC it says that the firmware is too old so I upgrade it, but still when reconnecting after a successful firmware write, it still tells me the firmware is too old. The firmware on it is 3.50 both before and after upgrade.

Can anyone help me with this? :)

I've been riding a bit today and, my lord.. This is awesome! :sunglasses:

Dual motors is waaaay more powerful than one, even with the same battery power. The steepest hills is not a problem at all! And even better, the traction is perfect. I rode on really loose gravel without a problem. I can recommend this to everybody! Even if you don't need more power, the traction makes the ride feel so much safer. The brakes are ofc also much, much better.

The only thing that's better with a single motor is the lighter weight and the slightly longer range, tho' range has never been an issue for me so that's not a problem.

Thanks everyone for your help and for pushing me over the line with the purchase :joy:

Have a great day! :grinning:
