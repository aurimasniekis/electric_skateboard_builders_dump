Hi guys. 

Quick question please, would any you know if the exway X1 board can be customized to use belt driven motors? Are the esc’s capable?

Thanks

Usually this ESC are configured to work well with the paired motors. So if you would use it with belt it will probably performs worse. To me the Exway X1 it's nice prebuilt board. The main point is the stealthy look. If you put belt drive system then is gone, but that just my opinion. Anyhow in other to do that is better to switch to VESC so you can put whatever motors under it and sell the hubs, I am sure they will be gone in 5 minutes. They seem nice hub that can not be bought elsewhere.

I agree with you. The board performs EXTREMELY well. It’s quick, responsive and very well built. 

One reason I asked was merely out of curiosity. The second reason is also because I wanted to know if a belt driven motor allows for a smoother ride? (Bearing in mind the deck doesn’t flex).

Also, thank you for your response

What will give you better ride with belt drive is the fact that you use 4 full skateboard wheels. In that case you should look to convert them to direct drive or buy a direct drive system. To me the price you need to cover is not worth it. Better to keep the exway as it is and build a diy board from skratch as you like. In this way you have a board to rise at the mean time.

I also started with a pre-built board, but then switched to DIY. At the moment my commute board is a short diy spud. Search for Avenger 12s3p...and you will find it. Wait I will paste here a pic. Now I made hub motor derived direct drive. I will test it in the next weeks but still don't have the final picture of it.

![IMG-20190122-WA0017|690x387](upload://rimRt77uKtLtBXkOrhAO7dVd2mt.jpeg) 

Then I will start a new build with a custom deck and new direct drive system I will make.

Oh wow! That thing is beautiful. 

Can I ask, from a prebuilt board....to a DIY one, do you have similar functionality on your transmitter? Battery percentage, speed etc ? (Sorry for the questions)

I advice you to read on the forum what are you looking for. You can use the search function. Since my short reply will never cover all the aspects. But to answer your question, yes everything is better. Otherwise no sense to do it. A generic ESC (electronic speed controller) uses in the pre-built board simply doesn't draw the current you want. So i general with DIY you can choose your parts, make it as you like it. Plus better speed, brakes ecc... 
The trasmitter depends what you want. There are several diy trasmitters that gove you the telemetry data. As well as phone app to change the different mode, speed ecc...fron your phone. The only advange of a prebuilt one is that is ready to use. For the rest with the same price of a exway for instance you can make a board double of the power. I used that one as example since you know it. Anyhow exway is a good prebuilt for short distance. Due to the small battery

Much appreciated! 

I will read up and try gain more insights into what is available from an equipment and feature perspective. 
I love the transmitter which comes with the Exway. 

Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions, looking forward to building a board in the near future. The only disadvantage is that parts are not really available here in South Africa, which means importing becomes an expensive exercise 

Take care

Hey pops don't rip that skatboard apart to change the hubs .. those are seismic TRUCKS with this hubs..only hummie is left with real skatboard trucks and hub build.. most are Chinese clone junk or garbage they made out of your old car and popcan melted together.. these are the best hubs you can get I'd say..other then hummie..I have a friend that sells the exway and is starting to get parts to fix them.pm me if you need parts

The exway has a vesc it fully programmable with blue tooth already it the closest thing to diy you can get from a pre built board.. the remote was from the fourm solid geeks design and I'm pretty sure most of it was built from watching this forum as I was told.. I haven't opened one yet but I will soon so I can't tell you if you can get into the vesc and reprogram it .. but you can choose from foc to bldc mode.. change brake and throttle curve setting there is alot to that board ppl do not know of..never mind seismic is a huge player big name in the skatboard world he help design his trucks to fit these hub motors..not sure what make of the motors are tho..there is words of more things to come from siesmic for the eskate world ..that board only weighs 15 pounds for real  it's extremely light for the size of it my single hub Acton blink S is like a pound lighter

Pretty sure the Exway uses a Hobbywing ESC that's very popular in the Chinese esk8 market.  Exway's ESC just so happens to have an app to go with it that allows adjustment to Acceleration, braking, top speed.

@rey8801  I think they are already 12 s I'm sure of it.. 12s1p lil-ion is the problem with them not big enough voltage sag but lots of power for sure.. I'd love to get a slimmed down lipo in one .. I'm waiting for his extra parts to come in and his stock in the spring as it's winter here .. but I have full intension to get one apart and mod it if I can.. the Pu wheel are easy to mod for bigger thane that's for sure ..we need a 85mm 74a super soft version trying for threw seismic and the truck are extremely smooth and carvy they are a forged precion truck just the bushing are not compatible with the standard style..which make the truck more difficult to tune for personal use..but you can get different duro threw his store and more are supposed to come out I've been told ..

I am a big fun of direct drive and hubs. Switched over hubs 2 years ago and never come back. I live the stealth and the no noise factors. So always open to see new products hitting the market. Do you perhaps know the stator size? 
I think @sofu  had the chance to try them out once in a diy build.

I know they are the same size as my blink s2 hubs I think 6355motors not knowing the kv ..but much nicer and lighter..as for the stator size no they were well sealed they are extremely light I know with the trucks on them that's for sure. They have wicked power when fully charged I really like the board big time and I'm a diy guy so it says alot .. they have been around for awhile just no one promots them..which is really weird.. you see all the other china junky all over ..but no exway..they are the best prebuilt I've seen other then the voltage issue..what pre built doesn't have voltage issues and lack of speed after using hard with in the first 20 30% of battery but that is a easy fix with a slimmed high c and a/h 12s2p lipo battery and a new vesc ..but still curious if I can hack into the exway esc the hole board other then the battery is really nice and work very very well together .. Ive tryed a meepo ,wowgo ,blink S1 and s2, boosted v2, evolve and the exway is one of the nicest I found very similar to my diy feeling with the control factor and it feels more like a long board them most big heavy beast pushing around...all the other esc are very choppy or lack in response and is really scary after being on a 12s high power carvon speeddrive with duel foc box and this exway rides like I my diy tuned carvon set up other then so much power missing ..but it's smooth and very reliable so far friend has had no issue with his he has had for a year now ..

Definitely Exway X1 is out since 1 year at least. The problem that the company doesn't sell spare parts but only the complete board. That why you don't see diy builds with them. Well I will follow your tests on it. I don't even know the sapxe you have inside the enclosure. If you have room left then a bigger battery is a must.

Yeah, I personally know Exway engineers in China and they still won't sell me an unpotted esc for my own experimentation... They guard their secrets very closely, but I did get pretty close to getting my hands on one and the dev tool they use to program it...

To clarify some information, the Exway ESC does run FOC, is running at 12s, and is actually Exway designed, Hobbywing manufactured (so not your standard Hobbywing ESC). It is NOT a vesc. The remote is also custom, and is NOT a derivative of the design by SolidGeek. Most everything on the board is Exway designed in fact, except for the trucks which as previously mentioned, are Seismic. I actually am able to get spare Exway hubs though really easily along with the trucks... hmmmmmmm

One thing that has always surprised me about hobbywing is the lack of user interface on esk8 esc's
They make some fantastic rc gear and they are all programmable all be it with a programming card or module.  I think they kinda missed an opportunity there.  You might be able to answer this conundrum too'
How is it the exway and the teamgee look identical electronics wise?  Both use the integrated flatpack lipo and esc enclosure buried in the deck.  Is the teamgee the oem or is the exway?

If it's not too much trouble. Seems like an interesting idea for a budget stealth build. Their hubs would work with any esc right? Don't know why they wouldn't

Teamgee uses some shitty chinese esc, and exway uses their own esc. That's the main difference. Exway is drawing quite a bit of power from their pouches if you turn up the esc settings (so there actually is a control interface, unlike traditional chinese escs) while Teamgee is not, so there's a fair bit of visible sag when you turn the Exway all the way up. I'm unfamiliar with Teamgee's supply chain, but I'd assume they're using the same sources as everybody else. The main thing is integration of the lipos in their deck design, which neither Exway nor Teamgee invented. That's been around for a while. They look identical because it's a side effect of the design. Teamgee actually has a major difference in that they weren't able to completely hide their esc. It's actually raised about 1cm out of the bottom of the deck.

@Indiangummy I'll ask how much it is. Yes they should work on anything, but you will need to swap out the connectors

You are a font of useful information my girl.  Wonderful.  That exway looks like a nice back up board to have around.  I just wish they could do some upgrades to the batteries. Seems to be suffering the same fate as most prebuilts in the sag department.  Anyways thanks for the info and as always have a lovely day/evening or whatever it is in your part of the world.

I actually use an Exway as my errands board and it's just great. Super smooth and stable and very powerful for getting up SF hills. It's compact enough to stow and carry easily as well, I really like it. The only downside is sag and battery life, but I'll uh just wait for [redacted]

If you're saying "exway is lithium ion" that's not correct, exway uses lipo pouches. I'm about to change the grip tape on mind and can take some pics of the battery and can see if I can find the model number on them. Hold tight...

Yeah lipo pouches.  Give great initial punch but drop off steeply and suffer from sag almost from the word go.  Especially if you are a big boned individual :wink:  I expect @sofu weighs as much as one of my legs so not so much of an issue.
I used to have a landwheel for my shopping trolley and that did the same thing.

If somebody is willing to fund some science, I can buy a set and do some tests by building a board to spec, taking measurements, then mailing it to whoever funded it to keep :stuck_out_tongue: $250 for the back drivetrain + however much the parts cost, I won't include labor cause I'm curious too haha

@dareno that's exactly it, below 90% it's still got torque but the top speed is significantly reduced, maybe by 5mph. I can still get up to 24 or so but 100% on the black wheels I can hit 29mph...

The website may say that but I have it on pretty good authority that you can put 90A instantaneous into each hub. I'm not sure what continuous is rated at but whatever it may be it's currently limited by the connector they're using which can only do around 60A peak.

Food for thought and my offer still stands 🤔 Maybe a 12s2p removable battery rail too hmmmmmm

For science I hooked up the meepo hubs to my test rig and ran 12s through them.  Surprising torque and it was only at the end of the testing process did I kill one.  That was at 80 motor amps though.  Got so hot the the urethane was pretty much shot to bits.  Science is a wonderful thing.  The focpo has the higher watt versions on it now so theres not much meep left in there.

LMFAO holy thats alo for hubs I'd never try that I tryed 10s 40amp it was a weapon at 27.5 inch long board I think I'm 25 or 28amp now is pretty good lots of power compared to stock junk doesn't and it doesn't over heat  before the battery is dead after a 15-20 k rip

This test rig has killed a lot of components.  Its how I learn.  Not one for paper evidence.  I have to try it. Thats a box with focboxes and all the other gubbins. Plug and play.  @sofu look familiar?  So stole the idea from you.  Those sk8 you see are now toast.  The only hubs I have pushed and have come out smiling are a set of jacobs.  They are good stuff.  Second only to the great humdinger himself so if these exway units are good I will be thinking seriously about a 30 inch kicker.

So I finally got around to changing the stock griptape to the cushioned griptape today

I really like the remote module placement (the plastic cross), it's really smart and prevents anything from obstructing it. I've never had an issue with the remote and this is SF, one of the most wirelessly dense cities in the US...

![IMG_5209|666x500](upload://5tdAmuO8ZmmMoJ9kfCN18cv1FtO.jpeg)

They're lipos. Here's relevant info

The cushion is substantial... hope it rides well too. It's supposed to be even more waterproof now but we'll see

![IMG_5210|666x500](upload://6x94dHqq0HebfovjsKKkkQVFxop.jpeg) 

I'll be able to pick up the hubs... sometime soon... Whenever I get the chance to walk over to the eskate shop around the corner :stuck_out_tongue:

Nice to see everything potted, after seeing a guy ride it underwater I had my doubts

The 250 is the price they would sell the rear truck with motor?

That's the price I can get them at. I'm not too sure they will sell them to just anybody, I have a relationship with them haha

I have no doubts it might survive underwater. Seems pretty robust

Nice, may go after them in the future for a light/stealth build, I haven't found any on AliExpress or eBay that inspired confidence

Why is the nominal voltage 50.4 and the charge voltage 51? Are these standard lipos?
```

---
## \#72 Posted by: sofu Posted at: 2019-02-08T18:49:54.221Z Reads: 86

Yeah they're standard lipos. I've seen 12s chargers marked as both 50.4 and 51v so I guess there's really no difference. I think they just didn't standardize around one notation cause on the fast charger box it says 51v but on the brick itself it says 50.4. I'll do a teardown of the [redacted] once I get my hands on it. I think those are supposed to be a special kind of lipo

Those motors are probably Hobbywing with slight modifications
 http://www.hobbywing.com/goods.php?id=642&filter_attr=.0 so ti looks like the stator is 5230.
I envy you @sofu all this access to different parts ;) Can't wait to see what you're going to do with them.

I actually measured the stator size when I was at the shop, the diameter of the stator itself was 57mm. I also measured the hubs to be 75kv, will see when we run on focboxes

57mm? That's really a lot :thinking: Plus magnets, gap and can thickness that would be around 70mm so 5mm thick thane in 80mm wheels?

Well, let me take it apart again and show you. There's almost no air gap between the stator and the magnets

Edit: actually now I used a caliper instead of a tape measure, it's 52.08mm so you're right! I guess tape rulers aren't good for this kind of thing :stuck_out_tongue:

![IMG_5222|666x500](upload://27LoQ0KlXKa1c9xiG0bzxNNCYzL.jpeg) 

The design is pretty good, it's three main parts: the thane mounting plate, the stator, and the can.

The mounting plate has a Big Bearing

![IMG_5221|666x500](upload://pYzRgQhf3Y7dWisGissvLU7HC7n.jpeg) 

Stator and magnets

![IMG_5223|666x500](upload://mFmOReWYqDTE6oKLGhUKZnVlUrj.jpeg) 

Back plate is press fit onto the can, there is a groove that the can goes into. The can spins and everything else is sandwiched onto the can via friction, pressed together by the outer plate, and spins with the can. IDK about the friction part but hey it seems to work so 🤷🏻‍♀️

Thank you for sharing this @sofu this just saved me lots of time.. cheers..
I can't wait to see what power you can pull with these on a foc box and excited to hear what you have to say from real world riding .. I'm stuck in two feet of snow 😂 I have couple months before I can test and ride thane hard again
