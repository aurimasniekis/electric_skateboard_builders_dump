Hi people.
I use a double VESC 4 on Trampa MTB 13:66 192kv
Temperature in the street +35С 
My vesc overheated more than +82C and the protection worked, I could not accelerate and slow down. 

Do many have such an overheating problem?
I need new box for Vesc))![IMG_4452|666x500](upload://3JTIXigX28TDZg2yqYNlLsleEVv.JPG)![IMG_4449|666x500](upload://vcNlvdQJXMXILSglB7e9nyWDKnd.JPG)

Should I think about passive or active

On 35°C ambient with a mountainboard (=> pneumatics ) this is normal behavior, you basicly can't get arround any type  heatsink if you run your VESC above 25A for a considerable amount of time.

A heatsink can't work without any airflow, and since yours seams to be fully enclosed you have basicly non. 


You should add a heatsink (if don't you have one) and think of a way that air can pass along the heatsink.
