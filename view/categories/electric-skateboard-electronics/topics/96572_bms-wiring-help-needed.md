Hi guys,

So i need some help wiring a switch to my BMS, 

I have purchased the Neptune Lite Smart BMS, its for 13 S but has a 12S converter aswell, i will be using 12S.

This is the schematic from the website:
![image|314x500](upload://992hfNeSE3OT4SKwYKKfDLQUtoT.png) 

And this is the PDF file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5VoC0prU-ShRHdLSnlKUDNKbWM/view

**Some questions:**

I will be connecting this BMS to dual Focboxes, do i need to buy an Anti Spark Switch? or do i need to just buy the switch? since it has the switch connector port on the BMS.

Where would i connect the charge port on the BMS?

Thank you
```

That smart  bms is specific for ebikes. I guess it can work for esk8 too. Check endless sphere. Tons of comments about it.

Anti Spark Switch?

I think you may need one.

I don't think such a small bms can handle the discharge current.

Is rated for 59 amps. It has some reputation at endless sphere. I think the discharge could be legit.
