I'm trying to order connectors so I can hook up my HM10 module to the VESC but I've noticed there are lots of different variations of JST connectors.  Such as JST-EH, JST-PH, JST-ZH, and so on.  Is there a specific one I need or does it even matter?

```
Focbox uses JST-PH 2.0mm for all the connectors and for the Bluetooth port itâ€™s a 7 pin connector
