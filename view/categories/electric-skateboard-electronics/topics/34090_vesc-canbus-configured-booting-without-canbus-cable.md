just received one out of two VESC back from repair. It may have been configured for canbus to do some testing, but I currently do not have a second VESC for it to connect to.

Is it OK to hook up the VESC to my battery to reconfigure it for single drive, or does it have to be connected to a second VESC via canbus prior to connecting it to power?

No ot won't hurt anything, it is OK to just connect it and read and write default config for app tab. From there it is all tye same.
