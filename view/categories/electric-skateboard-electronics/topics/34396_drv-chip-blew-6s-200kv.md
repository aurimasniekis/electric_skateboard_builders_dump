```
So i have just recently built a 6s 200kv Vesc 4.12 build. I set all of my settings at a safe limit and ran it for a while last night , 12 mph. It ran fine and nothing bad Happened. This morning , I turn it on. I pull the trigger and the motor glitches, and stops. Then I try again and nothing... I run a motor detection and nothing comes up, as it failed. I then run faults and it just says the drv8302 is in fault... Nothing shorted or anything... Help?
