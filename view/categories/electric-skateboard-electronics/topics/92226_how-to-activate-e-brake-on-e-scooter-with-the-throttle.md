Hi guys :)
Just can't find info how to activate e-brake on e-scooter with the throttle. I connected to throttles one on ADC another one ADC 2. Both are working.

Just one on ADC2 seems doing nothing. On VESC tool i typed a lot options like ( current no reverse Brake ADC2 or other ) and didnt get active anyway.
Can somone halp me?

You mean regenerative braking? E-brake is like a parking brake its a secondary mechanical brake that generally works on the rear wheels.

It's a bug in VESC tool, you have to go to general settings and set the input from "ADC and UART" to "ADC"
