Hey everyone,

So a couple days ago I noticed in a thread that some people were aware on how to mod you lipos to be slimmer but most were not! So im gonna post how I made my lipo's slimmer and the safe way to do it.

So i purchased a pair of Multistar 10 amp hour, 6s, 10c LiPo batteries.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/RC-Multistar-High-Capacity-6S-10000mAh-Multi-Rotor-Lipo-Pack-/251752433534?hash=item3a9d9d477e:g:mNQAAOSwj0NUiQJ7

(i purchased them somewhere else but they are identical)

My end goal was to make a battery that i could safely put under  my deck without having it smash into things when i drive (because usually high capacity LiPo's are HUGE and slim packs are so ridiculously expensive)  Note this is not the first time i do this, Just the most recent.

First i carefully took off the heat shrink and all the tape and soft pads holding the pack together. (this is the part that requires the most patience and a steady hand, as if you use a knife and cut into the Lipo's they can vent and youll find yourself in a mess) 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7de46457f56106899a956f43ef79a1c0aa7ef6dd.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f2cb3318408855ecf11c8fdcfb2ad7a4aec4758c.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

So i was pleasantly surprised when i noticed that Multistar doesnt glue theyre cells together because that saved the headache of spliting the cells apart! Usually how i would do this is to grab a credit card and slowly apply pressure in between the 2 cells and make sure to not push too hard to avoid making a hole in a cell. just be patient if you have to do this  step. 

Next youre going to want to open the lipo up like a bookand de-solder the midway point to your battery turns into (2) 11.1 volt packs.  Do not remove any balance leads except for the midway point balance lead. I had to cut the aluminum tab because it was spot welded. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/39d356e776d22b7f586e3ff1523f48000409eb85.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/47f0b60a09672e9bf59976a6b2c173cb13e51530.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/66dd95ebb24f9b8e890a5c2e770d59874fa4af4a.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Here is the annoying part,  The aluminum tabs on Lipo's do not 'wet' to regular solder.  So you can try to solder it all day long and your standard stuff wont stick to it.  You'll notice that one tab has regular solder (that is how it came) but the other I had to purchase special aluminum solder paste. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/63ba5623b7e6e33a561168588b04413c412299c2.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/32325b821457b2bf0062bf9053969cda23a19e54.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1156b07685beafae8be8960c07a37ae55c419038.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Once you put the aluminum paste and melt it with a soldering iron, you can apply regular solder to it and it will stick.

After that i took an 8 gauge fine stranded wire and attached the two tabs back together and resoldered the balance lead to that connection. 

The last step is to insulate all your connections with whatever you would like.  Hot glue, tape, whatever. 
And then tape the pack together so it is solid again and add heat shrink to the whole pack or tape it all up if yo udont have heat shrink!

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2079ca1b8ad929922cc8d61d6caf4eabfe6e0d99.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Thats it! now you have your own slim lipo packs!

I hope i enlightened even just one person!

With this method you can save money if you cant afford 18650 based packs (me) and with basic knowledge you can create even thinner packs that span the entire bottom of the deck.

good advice . 

you mentioned Lipo .

i heard this presenter says Li~ion at 40th seconds into video . 
Li~ion   ? Lipo  ? which is better ?

Li-ion is better, safer and has more charge cycles! those are (in our case) the 18650 batteries that the space cell uses for example. The quality of those batteries, as long as you get them from a good supplier, is un beatable (samsung, sony,LG) there are a lot of fakes out there though.  

BUT that being said they are the more expensive option due to their quality.  Which is why I cheap out and use LiPo.  :) 

I'd say LiPo gets you 80% of the benefit with only 40% of the cost of Li-Ion. For me, that extra 20% benefit isnt worth the capital (which i dont have) XD
Thats just my opinion

```
you can also bend the pack at the top so instead of having the two smaller disconnected packs side-by-side that you need to resolder you can have them head-to-head and keep the connection intact.  You have to insulate the heads so they don't short against each other and then reshrink wrap.  End up with a long pack that the wires come out the center

It has a board on it which you'd have to take off for over charging and what not. 

You're better off just buying ready made lipos and dissecting them. I reccomend 8000 mah 6s zippy battery or 10000 mah 6s floureon lipo battery.  

Honestly multistar sucks in my personal opinion

It didnt take me too long. A few hours max. I did 2 of them. Maybe one day I will have the means to make a video how I did it. 

For what it is worth, it is a lot cheaper to buy a pack and separate them than it is to buy individual cells.

Lol I just did a pack like that! I was so inspired that after work I took 30 minutes and soldered it up. I didn't attach balance leads or terminals. I have a lot of cells laying around and this is perfect. 

The solder is key.

SINCE I CAN!

I took this idea a bit farther and made a 6s2p pack. Each cell is 8amphours. So now it's a thicker slim pack with boss range!   Gonna take a while for this baby to charge lol 

I have a lot of cells that I had no use for lol and I still have more. Gonna make a 10s pack next same style.

Maybe cell to cell it is cheaper to manufacture, but for our purposes Lipo is cheaper.  A Li ion pack (mine) is 10s4p.  costing around 250 bucks thats without a BMS or anything fancy.  While a similar Lipo (also mine) cost me about 130 dollars. 
Both packs are 37 volts and 10AH

i know lipo's have downsides but theyre a good cheap alternative

li ion may have better energy density in chemistry but the cylindrical package is the worst volume efficiency.
Im not sure of the exact calculation but I reckon if you were to add up the air in between each li ion cell and add that into the equation I'm pretty sure lipo would win.

oh, and here's a pic of my latest build for those who havn't see it yet.

@barajabali, @lowGuido, @longhairedboy or anyone else who's done this, can you provide a name or link of the solder paste/flux whatever that you like to use? I know @barajabali showed some "solder-it" paste, and linked to some solder wire, that was supposedly much better, but pretty expensive (~$33). I only need to solder the tab that blew when I shorted my battery, but I don't know anything about this stuff or what's good, and would like to spend less on the repair than I did on the battery. 

Thanks!

So I decided to give it a go. I used rubbing alcohol, since it has a similar affect in break down the glue, and quetips.

There's absolutely no tears/cuts in the cells, but they don't look the best. Do you guys think these will be ok, or did I fuck them up? @longhairedboy @Arzamenable

Nice size. 5mm thick each 

Seeing as there are two cells for every battery balance wire you're really only monitoring both cells as a unit and also only able to balance the two and not the single as would be ideal...makes me want to put all my cells in parallel when not riding or charging.  Just let them all balance each other.   .. And now I'm remembering why people don't do this: all the series connections would have to be broken otherwise zoinks.

I would buy singles. It was kinda harrowing clipping apart the nickel connectors in tight space. 

... And then there is the fact that the half mutilated terminals don't solder well without aluminum fluxed type solder. 

Do it for kicks if you gottem kicking around, but I wouldn't start out on a shiny new build with this as a basis.

I disagree.
I don't think that's a good argument for singles. infact I think the opposite.
pre assembled multistars are already soldered and fluxed so all you need is a standard Iron and you can solder them easily. 
buy separate cells and you are working with clean aluminuim that has never been soldered, you are going to have to use aluminum flux there for sure. and remove any oxides etc.. it will be a real pain.

You need to think outside the box, my friend! :wink:
Why solder at all when you can rivet fresh tabs together? Here's a really cool vid I found! 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jucuDDLnadA

I'm dealing with a Zippy Compact, not sure if it should matter, but I couldn't get the new solder to stick to the tabs. I tried a few times with a really hot iron, and had no problem with the existing solder and wire melting, but even that wouldn't stick to the other broken half of the tab.

The good news is it looks really nice!!  But the amp
draw on one hub motor will be a lot and those cells aren't good for high amp draw. Really they are 4c according to people who've tested them. 

 Not sure if ur esc is like the vesc, or what others are, but at least with the vesc on higher voltage it will draw less amps from the battery.

A lot of exaggeration happens with discharge rate. People on es who use them for bikes have done a lot of testing. I've also seen testing on rcgroups that showed them performing better but I'd trust the es people. 4c continuous was max recommended

It will be ok with higher discharge but their lifespan will be short. I'd stack two deep at least. Or else set the max amp draw from the batteries.  I have those cells and plan to stack 3 deep.  When u do that then they're good and energy dense and can put out the power u want also

I guessed that at least 5c could be reality, that would still be 40A continous and maybe a peak of 80A. (still way above for example a space-cell).
I'll run it with a VESC (wich hopefully eventually arrives within the next one or two years :pray:) and keep a low max amp setting.
The board will not be used for hills, but mainly as sort of a push assist/cruising/coasting board.

If however, this wont work out, I'm stacking up another pack for 6s2p.

Do you think checking the temperature of the battery under the maximum load I'm planning to put it through is a suitable approach?

Hello guys, I wanted to share my tutorial on **How NOT to make your LiPo packs slimmer** :stuck_out_tongue: for the guys that couldn't find / didn't want to use the Aluminum solder paste.
Check it out [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-not-to-make-your-lipo-packs-slimmer-p/).
See you!

I got a Winterstick pintail which I really wanna convert to an electric board, so I can carve carve carve, and in style ;-)

Do you guys reckon this method could work with it's flexy deck (its 42" so could put batteries near the trucks each side), or better to add a CF layer or two to stiffen it up, and also do the flat batteries each side?

I think if your joints between each pack allow flex ie. use a few cm of cable or something, the flat pack becomes like a chain that will flex with your deck! just make sure you mount the packs to the deck really securely.

They are way overpriced. Just buy good old Zippy Flightmax if you want to go cheap.
Otherwise you can buy the new graphene lipos.

I splitted my Zippy 5800mah 6S the other day. It has glue between the cells, but using a credit card and some patience you'll have them separated in 5 minutes. Just go slow and don't apply too much force since you can puncture the foil and kill yourself. On top of the cells, where the terminals are, it has a pcb which connects the cells together. I dremeled it in half, leaving the tab between cells 3 and 4 intact. Which i carefully bended and hotglued and taped. Pictures are more clear...

I tested the cells before taping everything.

I have a question but I didn't want to make a new topic for those small questions.
I've a 6S2P pack of single 20C 5Ah cells but and ran fine for 4 months but suddenly I discovered that a tab has broken of a cell.

No you need the aluminum solder. The green roll that I recommended up top works great. 

But anyway you need to shave off a little of the aluminum casing to reveal more of the tab. If you go too far you will have a lipo fire. Only go 1-2 mm so you can solder onto it. You‚Äôll have to clean the tab off so the aluminum solder sticks to it

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010UMSB9Y/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 I used some of this stuff with the same kind of break on a tab and it worked at least for the short term, I ended up replacing the battery eventually anyhow due to damaged cells in it from low voltage at some point, now I'm ultra-paranoid about it.  Would see what you can do to reinforce those tabs on the other cells too since I think that's a pretty common place for it to break from flexing back and forth credit card style.

Yeah I'm making a new pack and I'm also a bit afraid this happens again. But maybe I flexed this tab to much without thinking about that it's just a weak spot to bent the tab. I have made 2 other packs and have never had problems so I guess this will only happen once :slight_smile:

Grinded the 2 tabs and added flux, then put tin on the tabs and felt pretty strong again. Also added some flexible glue underneed the tab so it will stay in place and hopely never come loose again :slight_smile:

Bump!! I am working on a 12s2p HK graphene 65c (which are true 30-35c in reality) at the moment!! That alusolder @barajabali linked works like a dream. The trick is to apply it from the side, otherwise the flux just burns off.

I am very excited to be moving forward with this project, as I anticipate pretty extreme performance out of this pack!

So I've opened a can of worms here. Traditionally,  lipo cells have a copper or nickel strip spot welded to the aluminum terminals that is easy to solder. The graphene lipos DO NOT. It's just aluminum, crimped together and soldering it is incredibly difficult to get right. I've been researching the alternative methods for this for the past few days and I haven't found the perfect solution. When I get the process right, I'm going to document it in a dedicated thread to warn/help others with the method. For now, fml

You really should have those cells connected together. A sheet of polycarb underneath attached with double sided tape should do the trick. Otherwise vibrations (and handling the pack actually) is going to destory those tabs. I've learned this the hard way.

Also make sure to secure the pack to whatever it attaches to by adhering it on. A pack that size can't just be put inside a shell, even if it doesn't have room to wiggle. Any kinds of impacts or vibrations are going to take effect on only the front or the back cell with the full weight of the pack.

Has anyone ran a battery pack like this with a VESC in FOC mode? I would love to make my batteries like this, but I'm worried about the long battery wires causing damage to the VESC. With a single layer of cells, I don't see a way to avoid having at least one battery wire run the entire length of the battery pack.

Most ESCs have supply capacitors for this very reason.  As long as you use large enough wire (12AWG minimum, 10AWG is better) you should not have any problems.
