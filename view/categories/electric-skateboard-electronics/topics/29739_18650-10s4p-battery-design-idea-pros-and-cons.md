So I'm trying to find a better design for my 10s4p pack. 
I was previously planning on going with the design i posted here

, but I don't like the long wire going from the battery minus to the BMS. 

This new design will allow for the shortest battery wires possible to the BMS (sits on top of 4p #1 and #2). The weak spot as I see it is that the upper packs need extra insulation from the lower packs. I'm planning on using fish adhesive paper and kapton tape for this. 

Parallel wiring will be with double layers of 10mm nickel strips spot welded and series connections soldered onto nickel strps with 12mm flat tinned copper braid. 

Sorry for arrows pointing from + to -. A bit confusing lol.
