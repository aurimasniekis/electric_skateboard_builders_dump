Hello,

I have successfully build my first ever electric Longboard, it works fine and it is really great to ride it! Thanks to all of you I could build it!

I am using a car ESC and when I am braking it makes a weird noise, very high, not very loud, but noticeable...
Is this normal? And is there a way to reduce those sounds without replacing it?

Thanks a lot guys, really appreciate it.

It's normal and there is nothing you can do about it
