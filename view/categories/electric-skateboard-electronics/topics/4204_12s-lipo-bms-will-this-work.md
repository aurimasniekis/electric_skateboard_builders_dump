I'm going to have 4x 5000mah 3s batteries in series for 12s. I want an easy way to charge my board, so I looked into BMS. I'm new so bear with me:
- Will [this](http://www.batterysupports.com/44v-48v-504v-12s-60a-12x-36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-270.html) BMS along with [this](http://www.batterysupports.com/36v-438v-5a-lifepo4-battery-charger-12s-12x-32v-life-charger-p-161.html) power supply be compatible?
- Where do I plug in the power supply?
- Is 60A enough for VESC/170kv motor?
Sorry for the stupid questions

Humm...dont they charge and discharge from the same point on the board?

I'd hit up the guys that did the battery and bms group by for assistance....

@longhairedboy can you put ur two cents in ?

Wel I'm using 100amp bms because this is goin on a mountain board which is going to produce higher than average amps. 

I think you can get away with a 60-80 amp bms on a regular board depending if it's dual drive or single. 

And good question about the on off switch. Not sure

 is what @barajabali said in a different thread

[quote="mccloed, post:7, topic:4204"]

[/quote]

Gotta be diligent ... All voltage is not equal... They differ between battery chemistry 

Also the amps rating can't be under what flows through the bms...because it will fry the bms 

Like I said gotta hit the guys that are making them now...the info is still fresh in their heads ...lol

I don't want to give you a üëçüèª because I'm not 100% sure myself ... I've been reading and watching you guys muscle through these dilemmas

What is the discharge rate on your batteries? If you are going at least 25c then get an 80-100amp BMS so you have more room if you need it. And you should only be charging your batteries at 1c so a 5amp charger will be quickest.

I think he said it the wrong way around. If your motor is drawing 80 amps and you have a 60 amp BMS then the BMS will cut out. You want a BMS that has the amps you think you will need. 80 amps is the sweet spot IMO and most packs I am going to make will have at least 80amp discharge continuous.

Just not sure what he meant burning the BMS out. BMS's are there to prevent exactly that.

I don't think it burns them out. They just cut the power, and if you are going down a hill and there is to many amps, you definitely don't want your power cut.

5ah x 20c = 100amp continuous. Get an 100amp BMS.

it has 30c burst, so how about [this?](http://www.batterysupports.com/44v-48v-504v-12s-150a-12x36v-lithium-ion-lipolymer-battery-bms-p-394.html)

100amps should be plenty. You want a bms with the amount your batteries can do continuously.

I run a BMS on my 10s LiPO board. Bypassing the BMS while discharging and charging with the BMS. Works like clockwork so far and no worries about maximum discharge. However you don't get the same security while discharging but I measure my batteries regularly and VESC has the voltage drop off so I won't discharge too much.

Also, I don't get all the fuzz about "don't use a BMS with LiPO". It's essentially a balance charger and you also get some security measures while discharging(if you do not bypass it). Can't be worse than running the LiPO's without one at all. If so, I don't see how.

That BMS will work fine, but that charger will not. You need a lithium-ion/lithium polymer charger. This one will do it for you.

@massy yeah i don't get it either. having a BMS and dedicated charger is EXACTLY like having a balance charger. Except the balnacer is in the board and the charger is outside, and all you do is plug it into the wall and go away for a bit instead of babysitting a programmable and finicky piece of equipment that stops every 30 minutes for no reason.

I thought he wanted a 12s charger? That is a 10S charger. Unless we are talking about someone else.

If you were pulling 100a continuous, your battery would die quickly.

I never said anything about pulling 100 amp continuous... I said 100amp would be plenty.

Well if 20c is what your battery can do continuously and you have 5ah then why not get a 100amp continuous bms? It is highly unlikely you will ever draw 100amps continuously so a 60amp BMS would be fine.
