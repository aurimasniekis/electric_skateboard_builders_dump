hey, i was wondering if a 20/36 would work with sk3 168kv motor, 83mm wheels and maytech vesc? i only weigh 48kg but im afraid that the motor and the vesc would be fried with a 20/36 gear ratio

The VESC only cares about the KV of the motor if I'm not mistaken and the 168kv is fine for mostly all voltages.

But what about the motor? It might overheat because of the low gearing ratio
