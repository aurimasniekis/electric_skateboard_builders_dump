Can confirm. I ran into a new distributor yesterday while riding in the gold coast. I tried the board, it's decent. felt slow compared to the raptor 2 but still good uptake. one thing i noticed was the free rolling was quite good. Not sure it'll be able to compete with evolve in aus though, depends what the price point ends up being but its definitely not a cheap meepo/wowgo.

"second brake resistor that allows you to slow down when regenerative braking is off" 

This is interesting, I wonder if this is how they deal with regen braking at 100% battery

Here’s the basic back story of this new line of electric Skateboards from Winboard.....

Basically known as an OEM manufacturer of Esk8 parts...probably behind some of the shitiest boards that have been sold on the market...I think a few of you know what boards im talking about....lol

Anyhoo....they added a division that has done a little research and added those features to their boards....10s pack using 30q batteries, LCD readout on the remote that gives you battery life and speed, 4 modes, 20 mile range....and they jumped on the hub train with replaceable PU....this board is not targeted at you guys...its main competition is the other Chinese brands....and looking to take away from BoostedBoard.

They told me they are not using the same factories to build this board and to service their OEM customers...not sure if they are trying to convince me that their shit wont break...we will find out....

Full disclosure I DID NOT PAY for this BOARD. It was sent free of charge. Should get it next week.

I've got a few of these motors. There's two versions of these one with slightly longer stator which is why the urethane won't fit to the end. They are pretty powerful with newer generic Chinese esc and not very loud either.

Its a different segment. For people who might be looking for something slightly better than just a budget board but still dont want spending 1400 on a single board.

One thing i dislike is the grip tape design on the panther....not my style..the picture of the cat and the odd constellation design throws me

Yeah the designs are really unusual. Try keep staring at it once you get it. You might be hypnotized and get used to it. After all the designs were actually paid a lot to be made according to what I heard.

Agree. That grip tape design looks like one of those unbranded super cheap skateboards with plastic trucks and wheels that don't spin.

First thing would be to rip that off.

Looks like a generic Chinese board with generic Chinese branding and generic Chinese marketing.

How’s the throttle response? As some may know, we compartmentalized the ESC because we wanted something a lot more controllable and efficient than what winboard had to offer at the time.

Hahah Not a chance. I definitely let them know my dislike for it.

But grip tape can always be changed...its how it performs and it’s durability that counts

They are unbranded indeed. Because it was paid for the design from an americam designer at probably 2thousand for 1piece and 6thousand for 3boards. Than it was gaven to printed out in a special method(which I do not remeber the name) to cover it on the griptape from there griptape supplier. Its unbranded, but its not cheap.
