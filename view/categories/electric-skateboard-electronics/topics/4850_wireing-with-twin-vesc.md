Battery wires are wired in parallel.
One VESC is set as master and you can connect a PPM Servo Connector to the 3 pin port and then to your receiver for your remote. You'll need a servo connector extension.

Think u could do either and just assign it a lower number (not sure if u need to do that even ) and do "send status".  I think I wrote send status on both mine actually and it worked

If a mod closes your thread and advises you to use the search function, opening a new thread is the thing not to do
