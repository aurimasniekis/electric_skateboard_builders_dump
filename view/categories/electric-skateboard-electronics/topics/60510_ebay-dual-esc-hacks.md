**Does anyone know of any hacks for the cheap ebay dual esc's?** Like hijacking the remote pins on the board to hook up a different remote or smoothing out the break curve. Searched for these hacks for a while but haven't found any. I am aware that for these kind functions of functions it is more logical to buy an vesc but it would be helpful to upgrade cheap Chinese boards or budget diy builds.

let me know of any mods or hacks for these esc's, if you know any!

(example of the esc I am talking about:

No, there isn't any way to change it. I have the same ESC and it has been designed to not be tinkered with. Definitely will need to move onto the VESC
