That is the $64000 question.  Depends entirely on you and what you want it to do.  DIY or pre-built?  You will struggle to build a board with that budget.  Not saying it can't be done but it will require some devious wheeling and dealing.

Keep an eye on eBay. I managed a clattery old raptor 1 for close to that budget.

Any of the chinese hub boards are probably your only option.  Nothing wrong with keeping the odd meepo round the place.  I have 2.  They are great little shopping trolleys and fantastic for lending out to newbies.  
Either that or scan the want adds for something second hand.
As @bigben suggested

The Xiaomi m365 is only 500W. A friend of mine has one, and before I had finished my esk8, I could beat him in speed by just pushing on my regular longboard :smiley: That aside, it's a nice scooter, especially since it's weatherproof. They sell thousands of them to scooter startups in the US, so they have such an economy of scale that the price is impossible to beat. If you do get it, keep in mind that the pneumatic tires they have are pretty bad; my friend bought an airless tire as a replacement, and replacing that tire took us around an hour XD

25 km/h in regular mode, 18 km/h in energy-saving mode. (Interesting that 18km/h is more efficient for them than 25, but whatever.)

18km/h is my speed when I'm not in a rush on a regular longboard, so yeah :smiley:

In practice though, when cruising on a sidewalk and avoiding people, my friend usually falls behind, because the acceleration on the m365 is absolute garbage. Then again, whenever we would reach our destination, I'd be sweaty because I always get sweaty when doing exercise, and he'd be just fine. :stuck_out_tongue:

Loving to longboard, but hating sweat is one of the main reasons I got into esk8 :smiley:

Edit: perhaps battery saver mode limits the current drawn from the battery to maximize watt hours, and 25 just isn't reachable then :stuck_out_tongue:

I have seen lots of people using them.
They look really well made especially for the price.
However they are too slow for my liking.
I always smile under my full face helmet when I blow past by one of them at 50km/h.:sunglasses:

My daily commute.
Not a fully charged battery so top speed is around 46-47km/h. Scroll to around the 6min mark.
Suck it again old geezer :rofl:

Why?
Apart from the time you need to take a dump it has all the protection an esk8er needs.

Dude I don't do mtb yet much to the annoyance of @Andy87 but I will at some point and when I do I will realise how hard they are to control plus 50 k's.  All good atm with my tight as street set up on the best downhill deck available right now.  60 plus k's is easy.  Your set up not so much.  Call me old again tho and I will find you.

First of all, we are probably the same age. So no insult intended just friendly banter.
Secondly, this is not my mountain board, this is my Evo.

I have no problem with speeds higher than 50km/h but I have to gear it low to prevent overheating in my hills during the summer.
