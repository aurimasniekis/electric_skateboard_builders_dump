Hello.
I have:
Two motors
https://hobbyking.com/ru_ru/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

And two batteries in series 
https://hobbyking.com/ru_ru/turnigy-5000mah-6s-25c-battery.html

Two VESC from DIY
I have installed and connected two VESC CUN .
I set up the BLDC mode and both engines work when I press the gas without load.

But when I clamp my hand on the engine and press the gas, moto does not give any effort to scroll.

here are my settings![IMG_2284|666x500](upload://trmsOBxpA9Fg4UK60iEq8BE79U8.JPG)![IMG_2283|666x500](upload://fU5q07kFZxpzUvHIq5L47SWEL1S.JPG)![IMG_2285|666x500](upload://jIpR81ltV1lMOfwHCf6sF9r4pCc.JPG)![IMG_2282|666x500](upload://dcwwgV7emVcRuugSsHWWGZuDhc6.JPG)![IMG_2281|666x500](upload://9hNtdpBLvIyRxZWDuBYF579lOX9.JPG)![IMG_2286|666x500](upload://f6zJhv7fB7noOaenX7rJrwqvvDA.JPG)![IMG_2287|666x500](upload://4KAkt9jKdEGv3nTxn2Yo8QUOdDJ.JPG)![IMG_2288|666x500](upload://aXYnDcu3KipmFmgMeaGrJgMUy4r.JPG)![IMG_2292|666x500](upload://bKMZh2vLVUARlT62AFAFY96ltPT.JPG)![IMG_2289|666x500](upload://jP5UMt6GQYzn1kXFtPThGVQMPLE.JPG)![IMG_2290|666x500](upload://2FXOlGP2ThyylZXeesh1rgsGAuG.JPG)![IMG_2291|666x500](upload://tCUxzWtflTyef5kxjeqbXxIGRUW.JPG)

Yes, I did everything according to the instructions.

The motors spin when the gas is pressed. But if I press the motor with my hand and press the gas, it does not spin, that is, my strength is greater than the effort given by the VESC.

You have to push start uncensored motors to get them going.

Edit: Your motors are uncensored so they don't know what way to spin So you need to push them in the right direction for them to start, so there's no surprise that it dont spin, and please don't screw with your vesc settings LOL.

Everything is fine, What I'm trying to say is your motor does not have sensors It will not Start powerfully on its own hence why Your hand can hold it down. Do you still not Understand?

I do not understand. I have ESC Racerstar, it gives a lot of power and I can not hold it in my hand.

May be changing StartUp Boost parameter, I increased it, it became more powerful?

All I can say is When using Vesc and uncensored motors. you have to give it a small kick to get it going. Some people like a smooth start not 100% gas wheels up So Startup boost is for own preference and If your board rides OK don't worry about the wheel not spinning when you grip the motor It's normal.

Nice But be careful with Vesc settings If the Vesc pulls more amps that It can handle It could blow! So after changing this setting the board does not even start after a small push?

There are more expensive Motors with sensors but you dont have a sensored motor.
Vesc Is great with little drawbacks Its not perfect. You're original Question has been awnsered.

Iâ€™ll say it too, that is completely normal with sensorless motors. You could bump up your motor amps up to around 70 or 80 to help when youâ€™re starting from a stop while riding the board.

Tip 1 

[quote="GrecoMan, post:14, topic:47411"]
startup boost should not be higher than 0.05.

Did you Lower it?

Tip 2 Be very careful with vesc settings don't tinker or joke around You could blow them up!

Tip 3 read your Comments on this topic twice and think about what people are trying to tell you.

dude he didnâ€™t say constant ðŸ¤£

you donâ€™t understand the relationship between batt max and motor max. the vesc will never pull more than the batt max. you could have motor max at 120a and batt max at 20a, it would never pull above 20a. the motor max just mainly sets your low speed torque

```
Are you talking continuous current in this case or burst? 
Cause when I log data on my VESC and look at it, motor max is at about 80Amp and battery max is at 40Amp. If pulled 50 or 60 Amps at times, for bursts. I believe the capacitors on the VESC provide the extra current for short bursts but once they get depleted of charge, max continuous current is dictated by battery max settings.

was the motor pulling 50-60a it was that the BATTERY current? itâ€™s totally normal for the motor current to be higher than the battery current. unless iâ€™m mistaken, the large caps on the vesc are to smooth out voltage ripples, but you could totally be right.

yea. thatâ€™s normal. the motor will always pull more than will be drawn from the battery. hence the reason itâ€™s safe to run 120a motor max and 25a batt max (like I do). the motor can be pulling 120a, but the amperage thatâ€™s actually pulled from the battery will never go above 25a

It's probably better to put the loop key on the negative line but electrically it makes no difference.  BMSs switch the negative lines and positives get tied together

It can just be less confusing is all.  Electrically it makes no difference

Please keep in mind that to configure the settings on the second vesc you will need to plug in the usb cable into the second vesc and program that by itself too.

They do not transfer settings between each other

Hey guys I was wondering, so Iâ€™m going to run a dual motor setup... does that mean I set my battery max to 40a and each motor max to 20a? Also for regen max battery -30a and each motor regen max -15a? Is this correct pls help. Also how to I connect the two via canbus using slave and id0 and id1. Helppppppp!

Also... as long as the motor max is higher than battery... it doesnâ€™t really matter. Like the battery will only give the motor 30a even if itâ€™s set at like 40 or 50. Right?
```

---
## \#58 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-07-20T12:46:38.372Z Reads: 83

```
the battery max depends on your battery.
if you run dual than div. that to 2 and you have your bat max current.
The same with bat min current (but this you can set a bit higher as you usually just break for a short time and will not charge const. with 20A for example).
The motor max you can theoretical set to any value.
But usually itÂ´s around 60-80A per motor.
The motor min just set to 40A per vesc and than look how you like your breaks. if too less set it up, if too strong set it down.

your vesc will not draw more amps from the battery than your max battery setting.
But the vesc can put out more amps than you set your battery amps.
if your motor needs more amps, the vesc will just regulate that by put down the voltage which on your motor. P=U*I more I less U as the Battery Power always stay the same.
Hope that made it more clear, not more complicated :sweat_smile:

Dual set up:
Yes can bus than one as master "0" one as  slave "1" and activate, sent data via can bus or something like this.
You could also connect your vescs with a Y-split cable of the remote, than you donÂ´t have to set any master or slave.

```
If you run a dual, you need to cut the values for the battery in half since each ESC pulls/pushes Amps and having two ESCs your battery sees twice the values you enter.
You need to understand the relation between the different values, which you can read in the post below.
