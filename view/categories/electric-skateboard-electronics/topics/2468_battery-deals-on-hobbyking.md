Whats better: 


4S 5000mah 20C  zippy $20

3S 5800mah 30C zippy $19

3 4s batteries is cheaper then 4 3s but 3s has a little more juice.

so do you want cheap and 7%~ less power or expensive and lots of power?

I have 2 20C 3S lipos @5000mah

and a 40C 2S gens ace @5000mah

so I would think a 20C is fine

i mean the difference between them is marginal... but i guess i'd go with (3) 4s Lipos. less wires to fudge around with and series connections.

  (i would just rip all the cells apart and turn them into one pack with one balance lead and one terminal lead)

Calculate the WattHours of the battery.
4s (14.8v) x 5Ah = 74Wh
3s (11.1v) x 5.8Ah = 64.38Wh

```
@NNGG "better" is really subjective in this case... it really depends on your priorities. I don't think the $1 makes any difference, so the question is how much space do you have in your configuration, and do you need the extra mah? Do you have an ESC that can handle 12S? If you're going to run 12S, assuming you use a 6s charger, I'd opt for 3 4S packs to make charging more convenient. Charging 4 separate packs will be a pain (but of course, charging three will be a  pain too!) I'm guessing that dimensions of both packs are similar.

Don't be fooled 10c 10,000mAH  is the same as 20c 5000mAH,

Just calculate the Amp's.

But if What your saying about mulistar is true that would be the main concern.

[/quote]
@Blitz maybe even 5c might be too generous. If you search you will find others who have postulated 3-4c... and anytime you use a battery near it's rated capacity it sags. Again anyone interested do a search (I previously had before discounting them). You will not find anyone happy using only 10c lipo batteries who is happy with the performance.    

The lowest rated lipo in terms of "c" rating people seem happy with are the turnigy graphene 12ah 6s 15c batteries bellow.

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-graphene-professional-12000mah-6s-15c-lipo-pack-w-xt90.html

In general the graphene batteries test better than other lipos from hobbyking and the rc guys are using them at ratting with good results.

I was just researching Graphene batteries,

It seems like they have added some element that Holds electricity well.

I was looking at the batteries you called out but I went for zippy flightmax
I'm Glad you guys made my day, (I was always suspicious of the multistar batteries)

I can tell ya..those HK graphenes are far from graphene... :/

The original batch of HK graphenes we're flat a123 cells and we're a lithium chemistry. They had an ok lifespan for cycles and thier IR was that of a regular lipo after about 15 cycles. after about 80 they were at 40+ mohm/cell

I've had zippys, nanotechs and bolts last longer.

Yea. I'd stick with the bolts or or nanotechs from HK if I was getting lipos

Honestly bolts are my favorite. They are LiHV but if you charge them to lipo voltage (4.20/cell) instead of 4.35 they last arc ages


Edit yes zippys are good to essentially the same as nanotechs

Nah charge your lipos to full unless your worried about braking(vesc overcharge cuttoff). Lipos aren't damaged over time by top of charge like like Li ions. The end discharge is more important for lipo(3.65/c cutoff at the very lowest) if you want long living lipos, and don't leave them full or above storage (3.85/cell) for longer then 48 hours

## \#30 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-01-17T02:32:17.945Z Reads: 68

```
3.5 on a lipo is damaging... Best practices with lipos is stop at 3.7... 3.65 is where balance starts to drift, 3.6 absolute lowest.

Liions have a wide range depending on cell quality and current being pulled

Good Advice I would of set 3.60v cut off But this makes me understand what is most important

3.7v  I could do because i bought more range than i need :)

Hey if you ever puff...
Put it in the freezer after you know it's stable.. it'll shrink the puff...then slowly recharge it.

Learn your lesson and never over discharge it again as a 2nd freezer treatment probably won't work lol...

You know...that's how you dispose of lipos right? Discharge to 0v cut the leads twist together to short and make inert then let it rest for 20 and toss it in the trash...

If it's not shorting anymore twist them together for good and throw it...no sense holding lithoum hostage
