If you own or have ridden a board, please comment with if it has push to start or not. This includes escs. If you want to add push to start to your existing esc setup, use https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/push-to-start-switch-out-now/60879. (not my product)

The following for sure have got push to start:

I feel you, understand though that no decent dollar-value production board has such a feature. Only Diyeboards

And the switch isn't extra , it's a necessary component

You need some kind of antispark and Martins is â‚¬35. Not far off the price of a cheap antispark. It looks like you're clutching for a solution when there's one right there

Why do you need an antispark, don't all escs come with them inside? (mine does)
