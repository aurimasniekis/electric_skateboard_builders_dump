Hey guys, i have a sensored Flipsky motor and as i have everything in front of me it seams i cannot connect the sensor. Flipsky sensor pins dont line up to foxbox, they are much closer together..... please help![1545344242448451429059|375x500](upload://i242qmRAWrXNWbWMWV3umT2kl7b.jpeg)

Or make your own JST-ZH 1.5mm pitch to JST-PH 2.00mm pitch cable/adaptor

Is it a male/female adapter (two plugs)
Or is it just a 2mm jst?

why you cut it like that? You can just plug the motor sensor in the adapter cable

Okay, i see that. From the top. Its Gnd, h3, h2, h1, temp, 5v... green is gnd, im assuming red is 5v(neg) and i hope everything else is right bc idk lol

Most important is that you get the 5V and the ground right.
The sensor order doesnâ€™t really matter.
T should be the old white cable.

```
* Red = 5v
* Blue = A
* Yellow = C
* Green = B
* Black = GND

From their site on another motor and white is the temp sensor. I've added a 10k NTC thermistor to my motors to the temp sensor works

```
h1, h2, h3 are the hall sensors and their order doesn't matter. Only the order of Gnd, 5v and temp matters

Okay..so Red=5v, black=gnd, BGY=sensor, white=temp.. sound right?

Yep, got it wired up and tested on my board. Ran alright. Foc wasnt quite as great as i had hoped. Not all that smooth... but it programmed or whatever to Foc so thats good enough for now
