Hey guys,

Our Vesc powered electric skateboards are very powerful, with a lot of functionalities under the hood. 
What we were missing is way to take full control of these features at a finger tip, without the need of carrying and accessing extra hardware like smartphones.

Just like cars have instrument cluster, electric skateboards can have one too.

Introducing Proton Panel - a digital instrument and control panel that turns your ordinary skateboard into an advanced piece of machinery. ( as seen on https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-use-pm/2992/5570?u=wajdi)

Proton Panel is standalone, with a new custom hardware and software design, only requires one connection to the Vesc.

**Some of the key features:**

* Touch screen - 240x320 2.8" 
* Real time telemetry right at your sight all the time ( Speedometer, battery voltage, temperature, traveled distance..)
* Built in USB charger
* Menu with different settings and options to adapt to your own configuration.
* Dual UART port for dual Vesc support
* Firmware updates through built-in micro USB, always up to date with latest Vesc changes. 
* Built in LEDs driver with touch color picker, effects, front and back lights
* Easy to access and configurable riding preset modes.
* Benchmark mode 
* Configurable sound alerts for low voltage, power on, ...
* Miles/Km units
* Ultra fast refresh rate
* Does not require the Photon remote or receiver, works with any standard remote

**Current Status:**

I have been working on this project for the past few months, I have built and tested prototype units with great success. Right now I finished most of the hardware design, still adding and improving on the software, if you want a feature added or have any suggestion please let me know.

**Price and release date:**
Since this is still a work in progress, I don't have a price set yet. I'm going to have the PCBs fabricated and assembled by a manufacturer to reduce the production time, handle large quantities, and offer the best hardware quality. I have a PCB manufacturer ready and they will quote me a production price once I get the design finalized. I estimate this project to be ready in about 1.5 months from now.

Thank you for reading through, I hope this can be useful for the community!

Well.. this is interesting. Telemetry for those of us who don't like thumb controls as much ;)

Does is store total mileage? If so how is it doing that?

@moon I'm using the widely available 2.8"  240x320 Tft display, the touch screen actually helps reducing glare. It is pretty bright. Almost all 2.8" displays share the same screen, just re-branded.
The display is clearly visible when viewed from above or normal standing position.
@brenternet The enclosure dimensions are about 90 mm x 66 mm x 12 mm, just enough to hold the hardware in. There might be minor changes, but nothing major.

As crazy as it sounds, I have actually rode my board in a very rough environment without doing a single damage to the device. I dropped my board several times as well, no issues. The design is very simple and rigid.
Think about how complicated your VESC electronics are, yet they still survive.

I was actually going to suggest using a metal base plate, with threaded bumpers that stick up 1/2" or so on the four corners of the screen. So it can't get smashed when I run into a bridge and flip my board over trying to do an electric Casper slide. Haha

I actually like this, no need for voltage display on the enclosure. Could call for larger battery configs in small enclosures perhaps.

Edit: Any idea of an ETA? and will this be connected to the ppm port? if so what about users using split ppm who happen to be using both ports for monitoring. the data registered would only show for one vesc if not by canbus right? @Wajdi

Thanks @Deckoz and @Wajdi. I meant UART. for split ppm we only get telemetry per vesc, well at least with ios apps we don't get the "double values" option. This would read telemetry for only one vesc, meaning two for one board. which is ridunculous.

@Wajdi Would there be a chance now that this has been created for collecting telemetry that you would consider building a simple, ergonomic, no need for modding, reliable, preferably trigger based, molded remote to go with it? You clearly have the skills and I think it's clear the market is there.

Do your bank balance a favor and put some time into a project like this, for the love of eskate!

@High-roller I believe initial setup such as motor detection and limits aren't frequently changed and should be done only once. This device is meant to be used for everyday needs, switching between different riding modes fast and easy. Therefore it wont have initial setup built in.

Ouff, waterproofing is important for any external electronic equipment for our boards. Especially when one can get caught in the rain, or trying to clean their boards. Would be a hassle to unscrew every time you need to hose it down. Waterproofing should be an aim for ESK8 by now.

Integrated rubber gaskets sandwiched at the edge of the display and between the area on the bottom of the unit and the board - sealing all electronics. Just find the right length and then use small amounts of glue to keep it in place - but make sure when pressure is applied that it keeps a full seal. Also if you‚Äôre going to 3d print this one, it‚Äôd be better to plastidip all of it and then put the gaskets for 100% waterproofing.

Anyway for a SD port to be added to save lifetime telemetry (I.e lifetime odometer).


The data could be compiled to see data that we usually don‚Äôt get to observe Over the course of a VESC‚Äôs lifetime, such as the hottest its ever been , the average Wats consumption over its lifetime, the amount of faults, top lifetime speed , displacement travels etc.

Edit: or even Bluetooth Capabilites (one might say this is redundant since it already has a UART port for Bluetooth Mods, but it would skip the Need for an SD Port )that‚Äôll allow Lifetime Data to be wirelessly transferred to a webpage similar to the mertr page that visually displays thedata. People like @Ackmaniac could allow for the data to be transferred and displayed on their app.

This is on what I am working myself, but instead of writing hardcore data logging on small MCU I will run fully fledged data collection/aggregation system on normal platform with correct tools for the job :) Because to implement all of this on embedded MCU is a bit painful.

Cause that means you always have to have your phone with you on every ride (The VESChas a limit t how many writes can be stored on its EEPROM, )  , It wouldn‚Äôt be lifetime stats per day, but the culmination of everytime you remembered to record your ride or take your phone with you. 

Since his thing is always going to be on your Board AND it‚Äôs conencted directly to the UART. Its  In the position to act as a lifetime Odometer/Stat holder in addition to its duties. Sure you can make the VESC do It, but again , it has a limit to how many writes it can do to its EEPROM.

Biggest problem with doing any sort of remote is having the hardware certified to sell it legally in the US and around Europe.  The rules are strange in the US basically any intentional radiator and from what I gather basically anything with an inductor has to be fcc certified which is at least $10k from what I've read, which basically restricts it to mass production to dilute that cost.  The plastic housing can be made at scale (10k units) for $2-3 a piece with injection molding but again big up front cost of getting the master mold made by someone who knows how to design those for injection molding.  Best idea I could come up with to make this at all feasible for our relatively small market is doing kits with some assembly required and links to known good vendors for getting the radios (in the US at least you can make up to 5 devices for testing I believe, adafruit has a write up on legality with radios).  Probably 3d printing the cases either in house or using 3d print services to avoid mold making costs.

Also looks nice regarding the OP, would be curious how the screen holds up over the longer term.  Have seen some TFT displays on desk phones that get terrible over time but I'm unsure the root cause of that (maybe just crappy screens)

I know we discussed this before, but have you thought about adding active GPS where it shows directions that it gets from your phone?  Also, will this have a power on button, so we wouldn't need to add one on the side?  Just like how this will make a voltage meter not needed anymore, it'd be great if we could also get rid of the on / off button / switch.  That'd be great if we didn't have to think about installing any of those things anymore and could just do it all with this.  Also, any chance you could incorporate a USB charge port, or 2?

With this will we not need a Bluetooth transmitter like meter since it shows the same telemetry via the UART cable?

This kind-of seems pointless. Most people will be buying the new Bluetooth modules anyway as you can use them with the vesc tool. Good idea but if your board has Bluetooth already then you might as well use the integrated chip in the phone. I can see this being really useful for telemetry and battery monitoring but I already have that with my photo remote :stuck_out_tongue:

@uigiroux
 Adding a USB charging port is possible. I think it will make a great addition to this control panel. 

I have looked into turn by turn navigation, but its not easy to implement. It will still require a smartphone phone to calculate navigation, and then we need to somehow send directions over bluetooth to the control display. I couldn't find an API from google maps that allows this.

I'm still thinking about a smart turn on/off system PS4 style. Nothing official yet tho.

@Jc06505n Implementing a password lock is easy, but I don't think it will have any security weight as is. To properly lock it we would need to somehow lock the firmware on the VESC. But even that can be bypassed by reflashing it. Sure it will make it harder, but still bypassable.

@JTAG is using the 5v rail of the VESC to turn on the BMS and ergo the esk8. When you turn the motor manually it creates the current, which in turn can be used to turn something on - like the main battery

Awesome!  That would be great to have that on there.  One thing I also just thought of.  This thing with a USB charging port and possibly being able to turn it on from there kinda makes this like an all in one solution to everything you could add to a board, but I was just thinking, would it also be possible to add a charging port, for the battery, maybe next to the USB charging port?  That would literally make this an all in one solution, and be the only thing one would need to hook up to operate every aspect of the board!  On/off control, battery charging power, and USB charging port, along with display that shows all telemetry and battery status, this would be perfect!! :heart_eyes:

* ‚ÄúDeceleration‚Äù This controls the rate at which the deceleration decay happens. For example at 30 rotations per seconds as the mellow boards have it implemented.

Development and testing are almost done, I will be finalizing project files for manufacturing soon.
I anticipate to start pre-orders by Mid July, and start fulfilling orders by August.

Regarding battery charger port and On/Off switch it will be hard to fit those on the device, they are more BMS related. Maybe a case mod for those interested.

Another question.  I had been planning on getting a Bluetooth set like the metre pro for telemetry on my phone.  Would this provide the same things, thus making the need for a Bluetooth module obsolete, in a sense?  Cause if they both do the same thing, I'd rather have this, then have to get the Bluetooth module and then always have a smart phone with me to be able to use it...

I have been working on implementing a built in DC DC buck converter to easily and efficiently step down battery voltage, offer a high current power source for LEDs and to power the USB charger. It should handle an input range up to 55V and output both 12v and 5v rails. 

I have been debating whether to have this built in or just leave it as an external component for everyone to use their own.

I'd definitely prefer it built in personally.

Would leaving it external mean having it wired up, but not mounted on the Proton, so we could use the USB ports from in the enclosure and mount it where we want?  That would also be nice..  Any way to do both?

Everything will be the same except the buck converter module will be external.

Upon further thinkering, I think leaving it as an external module is better because it will be easier to replace it in case it blows up instead of loosing the whole control panel. They also tend to get very hot under load, especially when using high voltages like 10 and 12s. It will also makes it easy to upgrade it in case more power is needed.

Buck converter module will be an additional add-on, it is only needed if you want to use the USB chargers and drive LEDs, otherwise, the control panel can be fully powered using the UART cable.

Dude that looks amazing!  Will there be water proof covers for the USB chargers? Or just covers in general that'll fit flush against the instrument panel?

I noticed on the top left there is a large empty area next to the display.  Will there be buttons or something there?  Otherwise wouldn't the display be centered?  Can't wait for more info on this :heart_eyes:

Also, where do the wires that will run to the vesc or battery come out from?  The bottom would be ideal for easy concealment.

I know you didn't want to make this have a on/off button and charger port, but would it be possible to create a case for this that is a bit extended and empty so we could put our own on /off button and charger port in the module without having to put another thing on the other side of the board.  That way this could be truly a all in one device.

So it's using the truck hardware for mounting it looks like. Any thoughts on making a spacer or mounting bracket for decks mounted drop through? And how that might affect the wire placement?

I was wondering about this too.  For regular mounting, I was wondering if the top side screws could be the type that are hollow and allow for another screw to screw into the top of that screw.  So you would mount your trucks like normal, then just screw over the top of that the Proton, and they'd attach into the trucks screws.

Like this, but with the proper types of screws, not these. 

![Screenshot_20180810-072518_Chrome|502x500](upload://tS2OazRXRGhfUyctLWPiCEXsuLT.jpg)

Though a special type of mounting plate for drop through style trucks would also be very useful too.  One thing that worries me that Hummie said about the decks, is that the tips of the ends of the board often split open when they hit something. So I was wondering if a bash guard for the fronts of these could be made which also acts as a mounting plate for the top of the board.

@Skunk Drop through decks should be no different, if not favorable. Because you can insert the wiring through the deck without the need to drill. 
A tunnel riser might be needed, something similar to this https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/official-riptide-sports-custom-esk8-tunnel-riser-group-buy-last-chance-at-discounted-price/57359.

In regards to the case hardware, a washer can be used to spread the force, it should work fairly well.  

@uigiroux That should also work.

[quote="Wajdi, post:99, topic:58664"]
Drop through decks should be no differe

  The top of the deck would not be flat when mounted on a drop through. (Unless you're not mounting drop) you would be mounting it directly to the trucks baseplate and any overhang would have a gap between display and deck.

This was my thinking too.  It seems for a drop through deck setup you'd need some sort of plate that would fit around the top of the trucks that are above the deck so that the Proton could be mounted on a flat surface.  Otherwise, as you said, there would be a gap between the module and the deck since it'd be raised up from the drop through trucks.

Hey guys,

Pre-orders will be shipped in about 24-26 days. 
In order to power the USB chargers and LED drivers, an external 5V buck converter is needed. They are generally cheap and can be bought for about $3-5.

I'm making a demo video, it should be up in a few days.

```
I see your point, however it is far from what this project was initially designed for. Adding an internal battery would require additional charging hardware, power consumption would be an issue as well due to the large display and fast refresh rate. Bluetooth or nrf module would also increase the power consumption, resulting in a poor battery lifetime, requiring a lot of more hardware components and an additional receiver.

This controller is supposed to be lightweight, with minimal dependencies to get going. Its a plug in once and forget it.

There are a lot of ways to get around drilling the board. Since the Proton controller is self powered from the UART cable, there is only one cable that needs to be routed, and it is flat.
It can be wrapped from the side with minimal exposure. Depending on your board design, it can be hidden underneath the grip tape.

Generally, you would only use one, connected to the master. The other one can be used if you are running two separate VESCs not connected through CAN bus.

If you use two UARTs, is the speed the average of the two UART data?

@LEE If you have both UARTs connected, then yes, the speed will be the average of the two. Amps consumption can be either set to display the total combined value of the two, or the individual reading. If you have any suggestions or requests please let me know, future software updates are easy to install.

@DilatedPupils Sure, if you happen to have the measurements for the eMTB mounting holes, please post it and i will add a version for it.

@Andy87 Regarding UART data over long cable, if running directly from the tx and rx pins then there might be an issue with voltage drop and noise. To solve this, I'm converting UART to RS485, which can run reliably over a couple meters long cables ( up to 1200meters ), this allows the data to flow over long distance reliably without errors.

The modules I'm using are MAX485, they convert TTL to RS-485 easily.

The problem that the screws for the springs stay out of the deck. Depending on how tight you screw it, between 2-8mm I would say.
This in outer or inner position.
So in this case we would need to mount some spacer under (or neoprene tape etc.)

This is probably a bad idea but I'll throw it out there anyway.  Since the Evo has a steep drop in the front under side, maybe you could mount it there...? We likely won't be looking at it while riding, well,, quick glances at least, but you'd still be able to utilize the touch screen and all it's features.  Just couldn't see the speed as your riding.  Lol, less than optimal, but it's a thought.

This product is designed to work with Vesc based esc's so it will not work with an Evolve board. The LaCroix board does use Vesc based esc's but the truck mounting points are different since it uses mountain board trucks. You attach the device with truck hardware and you plug in the uart cable to the master Vesc.

No, I just eliminated some excess case curvy profile that is not neccesary to me. Drop-thru front ends are already smaller on most decks. That curvy profile is uneccesary if the only thing you need is the four holes to attach the thing. So, the smallest case footprint should be the size of the whole screen/circuit board. That should be the smallest size for the control panel. Excessive plastic case around interfere (overlaps) most deck's front end profiles.

A quick update, a couple images of the 3.2 inch touch display inside the enclosure. Silver filament is what I have left for the moment, I will be printing black on Wednesday :slightly_smiling_face:

I will be posting an in-depth showcase tomorrow showing it in action! 
* Touch commands are all set
* Real time graphs and data are implemented
* Support for latest Vesc FW 3.40 is done.
* Dual UART port for dual setup or to forward Photon receiver/Bluetooth modules

I spent a significant time yesterday finishing up the software design and calibrating most of the touch screen commands, I also printed the case to test the fitting, and it was near perfect.

Maybe instead of 2 Usb port, we can have 1 usb and 1 charging port.

Hey guys,

I created shipping labels for all the Proton pre-orders, if you did not get your tracking number, let me know and I will send it to you.
About Unity compatibility, I'm looking into the source code right now, and I will make it compatible either initially or through a firmware update once shipped.

I will also post the enclosure files so anyone can modify to their liking

Interesting project. What's funny is that another community member is working on quite the exact same thing, but has open-sourced it: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/davega-battery-monitor-odometer-speedometer/71509

Would be cool to have a comparison between them. DAVEga is more for the DIYers I imagine, as it doesn't have a touch screen, everything needs to be programmed first, then the unit needs software flashing.

It's a cool project though, it's nice to see "new" products coming out.

Feel free to modify it to your liking. If you made improvements please do share with the rest of us :slightly_smiling_face: , we still need to figure out what would be the best base plate design, right now I only have the top cover done.

I will include the 3D printed top cover with current pre-orders, but it will still need a base plate.

So I got home and saw my kit. Eagerly wanting to install it I ran into my first problem.

There's not enough space on the enclosure for the screws. The thread of the screw skimms across the side of the enclosure barely fitting and that leave no space for the head of the screw to go down. 

![20190122_194402|666x500](upload://thc3e3b5QiMEK5ByfUpmNR0bak.jpeg) 

![20190122_194336|666x500](upload://nPBFbU0mQUs5uqZGRfyRHvgB9vU.jpeg) 

I can try to force the screws down but I'm afraid of snapping the enclosure. 

What should I do @Wajdi

The port to use has to be the master, the one on the left when facing up, after setting the app  to UART, make sure you hit the apply button.
Once all done, you need to power cycle while the Proton is connected. On next boot up it should start communicating.

Yes, the second port will forward whatever serial commands are sent through it to the Vesc. On the video showcase I posted earlier in this thread, I had the Photon receiver connected the second port, and it forwarded all commands to the Vesc.

Got my parcel thanks, looking forward to testing it

Hopefully a 3D design guru makes something sexier for this kit

Not sure if you are plannning a v2 design of the PCB but it would be really nice to reposition the UART headers to the edge of the board near the USB and attach 90deg angled headers instead if possible.

Then the stl could be modified to also have a socket for that, the net result is a flat underside and lower profile overall. I am thinking of mounting one on the HAYA deck with Focboxes and Hummie hubs but I do not want to cut the deck at all so I will try making a hollow 'riser' for the existing case supplied, slightly angled, but tall enough the allow for USB cables to not be interfered and for the UART of course to have enough clearance 

Just a thought!

Same problem with typical M5 countersunk skate bolt here. The holes at the rear seem to have a tab where the bolt would touch the sidewall, these 'tabs' break-off with a very small portion of bolt head entering the enclosure.

I made a test interface to avoid deck modification but unable to put them together with the front bolts as is. Upside down bolts would not not be my first choice, will have a go at modding the enclosure so you can bolt it in typical fashion

Edit: Tried really hard but failed, waiting on the gurus

@Wajdi can you please post the stp you have. I am no 3D guru but I need a better case to mount this.

The stl is too hard to modify....please! It's useless to anyone with the proprietary electronics, nothing to lose

Too many faces when a mesh is imported, you quickly gets errors like this and lots of inconsistencies

![image|681x500](upload://bmaqfx5dgbdAkB6w0Eu0Oulf00C.png) 

Maybe the gurus know how to deal with this, but your average Proton buyer is waiting for a case design that is structurally strong and supports M5 typical skate bolts the normal way...it's a skateboard after all.

I'm working on two part sliding design, where you can securely bolt the bottom part, and slide the top part that contains the display on it.

Thanks, trying print No. 3 now. 

Yes I did factor in that a USB cable needs to be attached. A regular male USB *should* be ok but I have not modeled it in. Nothing like a test fit but I will of course try this and alter the angle as necessary.

The USB should point inboard(?), not even sure you can change the rotation of the screen in firmware. For rain ingress this is desirable. I have so far completely forgotten about the mini usb on the rear, something need to happen for that too.

So far only done the top section, the bottom will need to be printed and tested after I get the screen right.

@Wajdi I‚Äôm a little confused on the buck wiring proton <>leds<>usb, can you draw a diagram of how that wires up assuming that you want all that function at the same time, for instance with 12v/24v led and your typical usb voltage as well. So two different voltages, is there a step-down on-board? I only noticed the two solder pads on bottom of the pcb

## \#328 Posted by: Wajdi Posted at: 2019-02-05T01:24:57.589Z Reads: 131

@banjaxxed The board doesn't have built in step down voltage regulator, you have to use an external one. So far only one voltage source input is supported, if you want to use the USBs then that input voltage should be around 5V. 
For the LEDs, I can add a new software button that acts as a digital switch, and use one of the led's data pin as a digital on/off.

For example if you have a fixed front light LEDs, that operate on 12/24 v, then you can simply use a power transistor connected to a digital pin on the board, and toggle them On/Off.
```

Gotcha. Ok I understand, there is only one external power feed to the PCB, the probability is that USB is really desirable since the inputs are there, so a 5v step-down to feed those to the PCB point.

Then for LED lighting, just so I understand correctly -
Assuming 12v RGB LEDs are used -
Use another step-down buck to provide 12v directly to the power wires directly on the LEDS and control them by wiring the colour control wires of the LEDs via the plug on the pcb?

Might be my understanding of RGB LED lighting

Just an idea regarding the waterproofing... I recently bought I waterproof iPad case. The ipad lacks buttons and is also a touch screen (obviously). There is a rim around the iPad on the screen that doesn‚Äôt actually register anything as a touch. It will recognize your finger but there is nothing is there on that part of the screen to open. The enclosure is plastic similar to ABS but when the front and back side clamp down around the iPad I noticed all that makes it ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù from the screen is a 1-2mm rubber lining that lightly squeezes against the screen providing a seal protecting the rest of the iPad. I used to run my own business outside and needed the water proofing but didn‚Äôt want some piece of crap plastic bag feeling screen protector with a case. This allowed me to still touch the actual screen itself while maintaining a waterproof feature from drops and rain.. trust me I put it through it‚Äôs paces. Haha my screen go so wet it was actually hard to use and sometimes would not register my touch but everything else stayed perfectly dry. I even bought it at Walmart so I‚Äôm sure you could roll through your local store and find something similar but that wouldn't cost more than a few bucks per unit and maybe take two min to install if you applied it to the case first and then fit in the screen nice as snug against it during install, which seeing the unit (which I am buying) I don‚Äôt see how this wouldn‚Äôt already work with the screens tight looking fit already. It was fairly light and pretty squishy rubber that actually felt almost similar to welders glue after it dries. As for holding up against a full pressure water hose??? Ehh idk but that still wouldn‚Äôt have gotten enough water in there to damage anything I don‚Äôt think... the rain was Kentucky torrential downpour btw.. lol nothing you would want to stand outside for more the 60 seconds in especially with electronics but I had a job to do so....  anyways hope this helps and hope you will give it a try. I plan on buying a unit and was thinking about applying a tiny bit of welders glue around the edges because it dries like rubber and can easily be pulled off without damaging stuff. I use it on foam planes and apply it and remove it all the time without damage. I‚Äôll be anxious to hear if you try something like this and how it works!

Hi @Wajdi,

I've send an email a while ago, but I haven't received any response yet. I have a problem with my motor making a noise when not touching the remote, and telemetry which doesn't work. Can you please respond to my email?

Thanks!
