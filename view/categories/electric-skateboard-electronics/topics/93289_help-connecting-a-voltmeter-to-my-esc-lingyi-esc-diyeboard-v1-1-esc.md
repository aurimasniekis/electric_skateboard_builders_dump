Does anybody know of a way to connect a standard 2 wire voltmeter to a Chinese ESC (v1.1) so that the voltmeter turns on with the power button from the ESC?

[Here](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01DW8AJI4/) is the voltmeter I bought and [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-can-i-change-the-battery-indicator-on-my-diyeboard-esc-battery/45217/24?u=atvking) is a link to a post that shows the battery meter connection on the ESC.

The post linked above is part of a thread where the user was trying to figure out the same thing but no one had an answer to whether or not it could be done. I figured since that one is over a year old someone might have found a way. I know I can wire it to the battery leads with a separate on/off switch, or use the antispark as a switch, but I'm trying to avoid that if possible.

Sorry if this has been answered before, I wasnt able to find another thread about it.

```
if you solder it onto the battery leads, it'll be "on all the time"  (which should be fine if you leave it charging when not in use)
