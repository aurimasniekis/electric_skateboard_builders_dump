Hi, last month i had a problem related to the DRV8302 chip and managed to replace it yesterday. But now the motor wont spin, the VESC lights up and receives signal form my receiver. When i press the trigger, the green light on the VESC lights up as well. But what i have noticed is that when i plug in my battery, instead of blinking 3 times, the red light lights up and for half a second and then turns off. I have no idea what the problem might be. I have checked every settings in the BLDC tool as well as all my soldering joints. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you.
