Hi,

Dear DIY power users, from which suppliers are you buying your li-ion battery chargers?
Do you standard charge curve or you are requesting to factory to implement a dedicated charge curve?

Which charge policy do you set for your batteries:
1. 0-100% and you do not care of impacts on lifetime or  number of cycles.
2. 10-90% and how do you manage 90% ceiling values?
3. Manually, and try to stop to charge before the full charge using vesc/focbox application?

Thx

Hola, the majority of China chargers are based on a kingpan schematics, such allow you to adjust the final voltage cut off and amps output.
They have 3 potmeter to adjust them as your liking. 
I'm in 1.

Good luck!!

Thank you,
My current charger is from YEWY, but I think that Yewy or Kingpan are equivalent.

My current charger is a 900W (48V/12A). It is doing a good job but 3.2kg is to heavy into a bag for a long weekend trip without assistance.
So I am looking for a 180W or 240W that will do 48V and 3A-4A and it has to weight less than 1kg. 

My DC sockect is specific, and I will add it at home except if Chinese charger manufacturer is able to do it for me (manage socket order internally) , but for a unique item order I am not sure that they will.

I know that switching from 900 to 240 will require 3-4 more time to do the job than previously  but it will extend battery life  also (expectations from my side) and reduce the weight of my bag dragtiscaly.

Do you know yewy?
What's you pov 12s6p and 48V/4A?
