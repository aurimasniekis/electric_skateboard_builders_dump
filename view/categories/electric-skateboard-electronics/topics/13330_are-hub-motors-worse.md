Hey guys, so I've been trying to conseptualize why hub motors have so much less torque than pulley driven setups. If you had a 200kV motor, and use a reduction ratio of 2:1, wouldn't it preform the same as a 100kV motor with a 1:1 ratio?

What limits hub motors? Is it the fact that they have a tough time dissipating heat? Why do they usually have much lower amp limits than outrunners?

Worst part about the hub motors imo. Is the fact of urethane slippage. Most in part due to heat. That's why you should run with higher voltages to use less amps and less heat.

It us not all hub that have urethan slippage, Hummie hub don't slip... but the heat reduce the power. Also, Jacob hub have enough torque that they can trow you to the ground. IMO hub motor are the future, but the product available on the market have not been design for speed and torque in mind, they are the first generation of there kind... wait for 2017 ðŸ˜œ

More volts in a motor won't keep it cooler

I'll be selling hub motors with the most power before 2017.   While info isn't forthcoming about what exactly would make the @onloop motor the most powerful it's a safe bet they won't be when they come out (Variables being stator size, magnet strength and temp ability, and airgap width) They also won't have the biggest (NSK)bearings.  Or the fewest parts that are solid steel (1140 and 1020 steels) with no little screw holding the motor together.  Or the cheapest price.  Or a lifetime warranty on the mechanical parts sans bearings.

is it because then the motor needs to be lower kv so thinner wires and more resistance?

less kv doesn't always mean more torque, depends on copper content.  higher reduction gearing helps the motor get to speed and prevents heat from building up as fast as direct drive setups like hubs. Also note that hub motor are outrunners as well.

I agree with @Hummie. 
It has been my experience that higher voltage means less amps but doesn't mean less heat. 
Guess it's not just amps alone that cause heat.

So if you had a pulley setup with a 1:1 ratio and a 100kV motor, and a hub motor with the exact same specs; are the only factors that give the pulley setup an advantage urethane slippage and heat dissipation?

If so, then the new Enertion heatsink hangar should go a long way towards fixing that, and his motors would have the same performance as a pulley setup. Or is there something I'm missing?

It it fails within that time its covered and you would think if you had any problems it would occur in that time. How many of your Hummie hubs are coming back after 12 months, Bet you wont be telling us that.

Motors have a power rating.  A higher rating (assuming it's legit) is a more powerful motor.  You'd need a battery and esc that can put out what the motor is capable of but still a motor can have a power rating of its own.  Happens all the time.

I suppose what I'm actually curious about is why hub motors are less efficient, is it only because they have trouble cooling? If this is the case doesn't a power rating for a hub motor have to reflect a hub motors cooling ability?
```

## \#19 Posted by: chuttney1 Posted at: 2016-11-20T08:24:45.282Z Reads: 373

```
Generally, efficiency of a motor is proportional to the heat generated and a bunch of other factors. There is more emphasis on heat generated because urethane is a poor conductor of heat. Power rating of a motor is somewhat dependent of its cooling ability if you compare a 2000 W motor and a motor from a Tesla Models S P100D. Although these are two different motors, the construction of it factors more into the efficiency. If you were to build a frictionless less motor that generates no heat. The motor is limit by how much current it takes before it self destructs.

I'd be interested to see some data comparing hub motor vs satellite motor range for routes that are mostly flat vs routes that have a lot of hills. I love the simplicity of hub motors, but when you live in a city that is built mostly on hills, they just don't really seem practical.

Hub motors suffer from inefficient drive ratios. You can hide this a little by using larger motors but your battery range will still suffer. 

One reason why range suffers so much with hub motors is they are dealing with much higher stall forces than a gear reduction drive and more energy is lost as heat because of this during acceleration.

Another performance drawback is poor riding characteristics due to the limited amount of urethane on a true hub motor. The best wheels available have high rebound urethane paired with a flexible but firm core.  A thin band of urethane around a rigid aluminum core is not going to perform anywhere near as well as a modern longboard wheel.

Hub can also be very efficient if its driven close to its top rpm. However the efficiency gets reduced if the Hub spins with load over certain period of time (heat is building up). So at this very moment big hub motors like the one for ebike are really really good, but doesn't seems to be good yet for an eboard (smaller than 5inch for an hour non-stop ride).

in theory yes.
in practice low kv hubs are only starting to show up....

also since you wrap the motor in urethane and close up most of the air flow you have to deal with heat alot more with out the added mass and crazy high running rpm that a belt drive would have....

what it really comes down to is what kind of ride you want.
belt is great for hills and crazy torque.
hubs are simple. reliable. smooth. stealth.

So throwing this out there,  would a hub motor with a pneumatic tire be at all practical?  You have all the cushioning you need, no worry of thin urethane affecting the feel of the ride  but I have the feeling the stall forces make it not possible or highly impractical.

This is technically not true. Yes, Pulleys & Belts are great for **multiplying motor torque**, however, there is a limit to how much torque can be **transferred** by a belt drive. The **belt** is a torque bottleneck & also introduces many other design constraints & maintenance requirements. 

When it comes to performance what is most important is torque at the wheel. This is why car enthusiasts & engine tuners always measure torque at the wheel with the car/bike strapped to a dyno, the dyno results represent total power minus transmission losses.

For example, Take a 9mm wide, 5mm pitch belt drive on a normal satellite drive train on an electric skateboard, you can transfer a max of 2Nm of torque into the wheel at 1000rpm. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/0/a0d3d580b5ac709261100396e45df2e5e864b7a7.png" width="669" height="499">

After that, you get belt slipping & reduced service life of your drive train (I dont have simulations for brake force, I believe peak torque for braking is actually much greater so you get more slipping). It also doesn't really matter if you have an idler either, eventually you reach the torque transfer limits. In fact, the only way to increase the torque transfer is to increase the size of the motor pulley & your belt width. This reduces reduction & increases losses, eventually you end up _nearly_-having a direct drive system! However, you still have transmission losses due to belt friction/resistance.

**Now, Install a hub motor & the power is already at the wheel, with the new R-SPEC GHOST Direct Drive simulations, we see (3X) 6nm of torque at the wheel at 1000RPM - the torque is also delivered at 55% HIGHER BOARD SPEED!**

When you develop a motor for a specific application you will always get better results than when adapting a motor with a transmission system. Transmission systems are just not needed in the new era of motor technology, they are inefficient at transferring torque, they are more complex to assemble, prone to damage from debris, need regular maintenance & have a higher running cost due to the lifespan of the belts.

Direct drive systems are appearing everywhere now.... there is a reason for this!

The hall sensor only improves the start up, they will be disabled once RPM increases.

The big improvements are due to stronger & larger magnets, big stator, Lots of thick copper for low resistance, high voltage & current throughput.

None of these advancements matters in a belt drive as the belt cannot handle it. So to get the most horsepower at the wheel you must use hub motors.

@onloop is a master of misdirection . Check his history and you will see he often changes his tune depending on what he is reselling.

The truth is belt drives are used on in much more powerful motors than we will ever see in eboarding and they work perfectly. If hub motors really were the best choice for performance we would see them used on performance applications on ebikes ect. but we don't. We see reduction drives.

The beauty of electric motors is they have very high torque at low rpm but even seasoned professionals in the electric car industry will tell you have a gear reduction drive train is the key to performance.

The truth is hub motors look stealthy and are cheaper to manufacture than a more complex reduction drive. They do come with several comprimises in performance but the trade off is negligible if you don't need range or hill climbing capability. If performance matters than you need gear reduction to attain an efficient rpm range.

Heat losses on hubs will virtually always be higher due to the 1:1 ratio. Low-speed and standstill torque will be worse and cause heat build up much faster and more than belt driven setups. You can use bigger motors like the Raptor 2 to mitigate some of this, but it still doesn't offer the same performance as a drive train with a proper reduction.

Is this necessarily true if you halve the kV though?

If that was a 100kV motor, wouldn't a 200kV motors graph look the exact same but with a vertical stretch by a factor of 2? Therefor if the motor was running twice as fast at all times (2:1 drive ratio) it would have identical specs.

If Enertions heatsink is as capable as he claims then it seems like the issues with hub motors are fixed... Another solution would be something like the Carvon v3, wouldn't it have similar cooling to a belt drive since the motor is exposed in a similar way?

Heat is one issue, but not the one I'm talking about. Imagine trying to open a door. If you try to push it from the side nearest to the hinge, you're going to have a hard time pushing it open. If you push it from the knob side, it'll be pretty easy to open. 

It's similar with with hubs vs belt drive motors. It'll take more force to get the door (motor) going for hubs since there's no reduction (less torque). Direct drives would be superior to belt drives if weren't creating a massive load on the motors by riding our boards.

I think a big issue with stary is you're doing the opposite of what the benefits of a hub motor would provide you.

Using gears will be very noisy (like stary) and one of the benefits of hub drives is that they're quieter and stealthy. Also do to the gear system, your motors now become higher maintenance than reguar hubs. Metal gears constantly rubbing on each other for thousands of RPM will wear down the parts fairly quickly.

That said, I would still love a nice planetary gear driven hub board like stary in dual config. The stary being a single drive is what shy'd me away from it. I do LOVE their controller though.

I've built quite a few planetary drives, they are noisy and very fragile. I don't know if Stary will be able to pull this off, but the concept is nice. But if there's the slightest piece of debris or the misalignment, the gearbox will seize up and destroy itself. I'm not sure if a skateboard is the right application for this kind of gearbox. 

Hey, kudos if they pull it off

I'll be back on the hunt for a detailed explanation as to why a hub is more inefficient than a geared-drive as I'm curious as well.  Maybe a really low kv could make all the difference. 
 Under lesser loads, such as flat roads, a hub is more efficient on a bike than a mid-drive. And then comparing the mid-drive of a bike with its chain to a board's belt the belt is much less efficient I'd bet 

@Jinra hopefully can do comparisons with me in two or three weeks and we can talk real numbers on flats hills and mountainsðŸ˜†

I think the main point is the general characteristic of all BLDC motors is that they are most powerful and most efficient at a certain higher RPM. Therefore we use gearing to make the motor operate in that most efficient RPM range for the most time.
Hub motors even with low KV cannot move the efficiency band close enough to the low RPM speeds of a skateboard. Thus you will be using the motor at a less powerful and less efficient RPM range, during most of your riding.

well if you have a low kv hub you'll get top speeds well within esk8 applications. You can hit the power/efficiency sweet spot, but getting to that point from low/no speed is not as efficient.

```
But if efficiency is solely determined by the rpm the motor is in a pulley system will simply move that rpm range over further to the left of the graph I posted.  Lowering the motor kv would similarly bring the rpm range to the left.  In doing that, lowering kv, if there is the same amount of copper and resistance they should perform the same.  Lowering the kv generally increases the winding resistance though so..with the belt you can keep a lower winding resistance and have the torque while direct drive must increase the winding resistance to get the torque.  But at the same time I read !!! Torque is equal to to heat if the motor is appropriately wound to its voltage!!! Meaning a 2000kv motor can put out as much torque to heat ratio as a 200kv if the voltage is right and its in its sweet spot as the graph shows. Lower voltage for higher kv. But this is still going to be less torque for a given temp increase than a pulley set-up 
That's my explanation and hoping to hear what you guys think.  A 90kv hub with the same winding resistance as a 200kv with gearing maybe 

And what of a big hub motor. It's winding resistance will be decreased. It will be heavier. And the motor alone will likely have larger loses at low loads but better on the heavy loads.

Hummm... I don't really see your point... we have done some testing for the vesc-x this weekend in foc mode over a F1 racing track, with two totally different setup. One with hub and the other one was a single r-spec 6374, and we where pretty much following each other at 40km/h without any problem.

[/quote]

Yes, Of course, I am going to use numbers because it's the numbers that define the limits of a system.That's why the manufacturer provides this data. You can read the document yourself here: http://file.lasersaur.com/docs-thirdparty/The_World_of_Timing_Belts.pdf

**Let me simplify this.**

1. The numbers in **red box** are RPM (10 to 14000)
2. The numbers in the **blue box** are torque transfer ratings from the manufacturer (8.84 to 1.45)
3. The **highlighted** numbers in black box are as follows
 - At the top is **15** this is belt width - 15mm wide. (Most dual drives are using 9mm multiply torque by 0.6)
 - Next number is **18** this is teeth of motor pulley (Most esk8 builders use much less, 15 & 16 teeth)
 - The bottom is belt size, the smaller the belt the less torque it can transfer. (Most esk8 use the one I highlighted, multiply 0.75))

## **NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE DATA FOR BELT DRIVES YOU CAN COMPARE WITH DATA FROM DIRECT DRIVE SYSTEMS**

This is a chart for Jacobs Hub motors.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/f/dfdc63baf76c4055e0a4a463261a498a8dfda670.jpg" width="584" height="500">


* Take a look at the red line, this is **TORQUE**
* Now look at the **1000RPM mark at the bottom - it shows 3Nm**
* Now calculate the torque transfer limit for a **15mm wide belt drive system at 1000RPM with 18 tooth motor pulley**.
 - = **4.4Nm x 0.75** _(belt size factor)_ = **3.33Nm**
* Now calculate the torque transfer limit for a 9mm wide belt drive system at 1000RPM with 18 tooth motor pulley.
 - = **4.4nm x 0.75** _(belt size factor)_ x **0.60** _(belt width factor)_ = **1.98Nm**


**At 1000RPM one Jacob Hub motor has 51.5% more torque at the wheel when compared to the max that can be transferred by a Belt drive system with 9mm wide belt - only with a 15mm wide belt is it equal.**



----------


----------



Now the coolest thing is that you can easily make a bigger hub motor, one with more torque. With our simulations for the R-SPEC GHOST direct drive we are seeing double the torque at the wheel when compared with a 15mm belt drive which are only being used by evolve atm.

**What is even more exciting is how much more torque you have at higher RPM. Much more torque & much higher board speed when compared to 9mm wide belts.**

I appreciate the numbers,  but this calculation does not take into consideration the wheel pulley.  Say for argument sake you do use the 18 tooth and the limit in the belt ends up being 2Nm in the belt,  but with the reduction of 2:1,  so you have your nylon pulley in some flywheels,  the  reduction in gearing means 2Nm in the belt translates to 4Nm at the wheel.  Where is that considered in these calculations?

Yes, assuming you also ignore friction losses which i don't have data on, you can keep multiplying the torque with gearing/reduction, however, the bottleneck is still at the drive pulley. The design constraints are still there. Furthermore, It's also hard to get a lot of reduction due to the wheel sizes we commonly use. You can do what boosted boards did & go with 3mm pitch, however, the torque transfer of those belts is lower again. 

I think the best bet for Maximum Torque belt drive is 15mm - 5mm pitch (or if possible wider) belts & maximum reduction possibly using idlers to ensure 6 teeth in mesh ([however, idlers are not recommended, see excerpt below](http://file.lasersaur.com/docs-thirdparty/The_World_of_Timing_Belts.pdf)) So maybe like 13 to 40 reduction ratio to get approx 3x the torque at the wheel.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/3/7326ac46a9fce55139871963df9f16b549efae68.png" width="690" height="127">

With 3x the torque at the wheel, so approx 10Nm at 1000RPM, you are now seeing more torque at the wheels when compared to the my hub motor simulations, of course, a hub motor can just be fed more current too (which we will be testing the limits of this on our dyno) meaning the only bottle neck it faces is how quickly you can dissipate heat. Heat pipes & liquid cooling is an option.

So this belt drive system is not impossible to build, perhaps a bit impractical for an esk8 & slightly outside the recommendations of pulley drive systems. Actually, we see this system commonly on eMTB builds: 
https://www.instagram.com/p/BNFbDtvgmWB/?taken-by=chiboards

This is an example of what you need for your esk8 to match/better hub motor torque output.

Isn't size also a bottleneck?  By putting a motor inside a wheel you've set up a losing economy wherein to get a bigger motor you have to sacrifice thane thickness.  UNess you do Jerry's new design that is awesome innovation.... outboard hub connection solves cooling and wheel selection issues right?
And efficiency decreases with heat, you might could improve heat management in a hub but will you ever beat an outboard motor stuck to a heat-sinking mount (like ollinboard new one with huge cooling fins)

Just for the record there are two major heat generating mechanisms in electric motors. The first is resistance in the windings which become hotter and hotter as current increases. The second is magnetic Flux which causes heat build up in the stator stack. The higher the voltage,the stronger the magnetic flux. Building a cool running motor is a balance of voltage and current. 

For example my father is an electrical engineer and his company designs high voltage generators and motors. One time a technician accidentally ran a motor rated at around 13,000 volts at almost 23,000 volts. The voltage was higher so less current went through the windings, but the higher voltage also created a much stronger magnetic Flux which cased the stator plates to get so hot they fused together and caused the entire rotor to seize.

Higher voltage != less heat (directly at least)

The whole topic about the higher power of outrunner is pointless to me. Who of us is driving his dual with 70 max battery amps on each vesc. Because only then you would use the max potential.

By the way. 1000 watts is already enough for 50km/h

If you design your drive train to run at amperage and voltages that are "typical" then you end up burning out and replacing parts in that one case where you have to drive up a steep hill from a stop with a heavy backpack. Always design with wiggle room, or you end up buying things twice. It's not uncommon to draw ~30 amps for more than a couple seconds while hill climbing

I have seen your misguided rants on your attempts to understand electrical engineering and I'm not about to let this turn into that. Wattage = voltage * amperage (aka current). For our purposes wattage is a constant, so therefore if voltage increases current must decrease.

 A naive person would then say "I know that heat is related to resistance and current, so I should run at the highest voltage I can in order to reduce current and therefore reduce heat". THIS IS WRONG, since they are ignoring magnetic Flux which causes heat to be generated as the voltage increases.

In reality an efficient motor draws a balance between voltage and amperage where the heat generated by each is a minimized.

@Namasaki there are a ton of factors that determine the most effective voltage and amperage to run at. Some of which would be stator size, pole count, copper resistance, copper density, thickness of stator plates, gearing, etc. I cannot give an exact equation, I'm sorry. For our intents and purposes empirical testing guided by sound theoretical understanding is a good guide to finding the best solution.

I personally will never run hub motors as you are at a mechanical disadvantage, and add unnecessary losses. And no the losses of a belt rubbing on a pulley are not even close to the losses of being at a mechanical disadvantage no matter what @onloop tells you. They look speak and are easier to maintain but let's not pretend they are a more efficient system when compared to belt systems.

the general understanding, and don't hold back and grumble but tell me where I'm wrong, is that the increase in voltage increases the no-load speed.  If the voltage is increased and you still go the same slow speed you are more inefficient.  Ideal efficiency being at about 80percent of the no load.

I need to explicitly state that I am not an electrical engineer, I am a computer scientist who asks his father about electrical phenomena alot when I get curious and hence have a decent understanding. 

You are correct, inductance is related to current. You have to understand however that voltage and current are two sides of the same coin, and that magnetic fields can generate voltage which generates emf which causes current to flow. There are many losses in electrical motors and often as you adjust to minimize one you end up maximizing another, they are all fundamentally connected. 

If you want a more explicit explanation then talk to an electrical engineer, they would know all the correct terminology and such.

So you have to find the proper balance of voltage and current to maximize efficiency and minimize heat.

Yes you have to find the proper balance to get efficiency and reduce heat. But regardless of what combination u chose. 100 volts or 10 volts, you will get the same heat and efficiency if the motor is wound right.  Bldc motors.  If anything, what will happen is what happened to you @Namasaki where you had worse efficiency with greater voltage.  You increase the voltage you will increase the no-load speed. The motor is most efficient at 80percent roughly of the no-load...you ended up riding at a speed further from it.

Hi all, I know this thread is dead but... I thought I had an angle and some experience others may relate too that might make people think about some things in a different way.

On motocross bikes it is not uncommon to increase flywheel weight to improve tractability and ultimately lap speed. You end up with less wheel spin, being smoother and on/off the throttle a lot less so you are faster. Although on low powered bikes this is never a problem because they don't have enough engine to light up the rear. 

A large portion of the rotational mass on a eSk8 or eMTB is the rotor. Surely this has to smooth out ride characteristics over rough ground or smooth out power delivery when tire grip is being pushed and reduce chopping on the throttle as compared to a hub motor?
Maybe software is the answer, maybe not?

Getting on and off the throttle and spinning the wheels with a pulley system can still end in fire works though (video credit: Nowind/Jens/e-toxx)

Another thing I would like to know is the torque vs amp at start rpm and 5-10km/h. A figure at 1000rpm with a 100mm wheel doesn't tell enough about the start ability as that's well up to speed and then both hubs and belt system works. 

The problem with little to no urethane on the wheels I can relate to. It almost feels like riding on aluminum on my hub motors.

The truth is hub motors look stealthy and are cheaper to manufacture than a more complex reduction drive.

## Proof? DELIVERED

[quote="NickTheDude, post:56, topic:13330"]
I'd be interested to see if the newer hub motors coming out have similar hill climbing ability to a belt drive once they are already up to speed.

## Hill Climbing ability? PROVEN

[quote="saul, post:24, topic:13330"]
belt is great for hills and crazy torque.


hubs are simple. reliable. smooth. stealth.

Have you tried 80A motor max and 40A battery max? Battery should be prepared to run 40A on each Focbox as your Samsung 30Q or 25R have 20A maximum discharge and you have 4P = 80A

30A/60A is technically the correct number for 30Q cells as their rated discharge is 15A/cell. While DIYers use 20A/cell commonly, it's probably not a wise idea to go out of spec on a commercial board.

Yes, we could run higher current, 80a battery current is possible. Our electronics can handle it.

However, we are choosing to de-tune the performance of the Raptor 2. We are doing this for two reasons;
1. Performance is already insane at 60A battery current, this is backed by a performance guarantee
2. We don't want to expose the cells to unnecessary stress.

NOTE: end user can do this if they want... that's the beauty of the electronics componentry we have engineered

Hell yeah! good job Jason! Looks like you are getting some decent start up compared to the other of the shelf consumer boards. A pair of [OM-6085](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/om-6085-200kv) reduction drives will still blow your doors off! ;)

I have to admit I never even thought to use more poles in the motor to increase the voltage used a lower rpm till I saw those hubs maytech was slinging. How many stator poles are you using? Looks like 28 poles but it is hard to tell. I'm still hooked on the versatility and low end torque a reduction drive provides, still the best in that regard. And lets face it, in-wheel hubs have a crappy ride compared to a nice set of abec flywheels. Not something you want when flying around a turn at high speed.  

I will tell you this. If I did not care about havening the absolute best wheels and ride quality or did not need the ability to change drive ratios easily I would be developing hubs right there with you.

Even then I'm not sure you can beat direct torque at the wheels.

The issue in the past was due to belts slipping not breaking from overload. This was due to poor design and thin flexible mounts. Our [idler drive](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/dual-motor-kit) solved this problem and now we are seeing more builders using an idler in their designs with great success!

Most builders want versatility in wheel selection too. Hubs are cool but you will never convince a seasoned rider that they have a superior ride quality when compared to the best wheels on the market. Thin urethane over a metal core rides like a rock and was tried and failed long before you got evolved in longboarding.

Now thats some serious dedication to range! Still, I'd love to see you develop a hub. I think as time goes on, the community will figure out more of the details of how to optimize hub motors. 4wd with hummies small motors and your VESCs, now sensored, and I can still climb a 25% grade hills with little reduction in speed. And these are far from optimized.

Yeah, I don't expect to make it up to the top on 860Wh's, might need to get a jockey on it and record the difference! I think the race starts about 12 miles from the top. My main concern is road conditions and staying ahead of traffic. This means at least 25 mph and I think we are hitting those speeds now on an average grade. Hope to hold a much higher speed but the real test is doing it.

I'll stick with the R2.... Once you have ridden something with huge amounts of direct drive torque in the wheels it's hard to go back to the old technology of belts and pulleys

Also, Didn't realise you had any complete boards available ;) you build boards?

In about 4 weeks there will be 500 R2 in the wild... Surely someone can lend you one for a ride... You'll finally understand what real performance feels like.

Give it a few weeks, everything is about to change. New v3 hummie hubs are being assembled in San Francisco as we speak... We're in the process of running computer aided simulations and making final adjustments for the motors materials. Most of the parts have already arrived. Affordable, yet powerful hubs. 4WD is going to be insane. Likely 80mm to start with, 90mm and 97mm options to come in the near future.

That is the other factor, a choice of wheel size, most hub suppliers only have one size. Personally I will only run 97s as some of the roads around me could only loosely be called paved. 

Even when hummie's and carvon's are available the number of high performance hubs can be counted on one hand. :grimacing: we need more!! 

4WD hubs will always be awesome ignoring the $$$. You can even get pretty good performance from average hubs this way. Most people are not going that extreme though.

I think the power would be comparable with my dual 6355s 230kv runing 10S on 15/40T ratio and 97mm flywheels, I'd be glad if the Raptor has more torque and it's in fact faster

Here's some free market research for you guys, 

I extracted this data from acton crowdfunding campaign before it had finished.


**majority of the orders in this snapshot were for the $600 product.** 

**next largest unit qty sold was for the $400 product**

## 60% of the orders were for the product under $600

the current market doesn't know what high-quality wheels are... they probably don't even know what a truck & bushings are....

If you want your business to sell only to a micro niche that's cool, but ask yourself is it viable?

I have talked to @ChrisChaput  before also, he called me for advice on making electric skateboards, I also wanted to use his wheels for Raptor 1, but I don't think he fully understood the esk8 market at that stage.... & after he got the info he needed he eventually stopped replying to my emails about ordering his wheels. Maybe he had too much money? :slight_smile: Maybe he didn't think us small guys would end up big guys, I think it was a lost opportunity for him..... 

Personally, I think these guys are going to miss the esk8 boat.... their only hope now is raising cash fast & buying one of us small guys out, maybe carvon is a good match for a buyout by @ChrisChaput .. 

Maybe I would have considered an offer 12 months ago.... but they would need double digit millions now and they don't have it. 

the sad truth is that the traditional world of skateboards & the market as it stands today is going to get turned on its head by the few small, but successful, esk8 companies who moved too fast, sold too much and became too established in a new market that they still don't fully understand.

That's exactly what happened when Chris introduced his unique style of wheels to the market.... he was the underdog coming in and disrupting the skateboard market.

Here is a snippet from 2009, Chris is explaining how different players in a market react to disruptive new products/markets. Basically exactly what is happening now with esk8 builders pushing their way onto the scene with new an innovative products.

micro niche is cool though & eventually, the seasoned riders will come to see the light....... just need a few years for it to develop.
[/quote]

Agreed. Give it a few years and I think things will change. I was a seasoned rider, and I got into e-boarding... All of my friends tell me they would never think to buy an eboard, but I give them mine for a ride and they say they'd be more inclined after trying it. I think price will always be important, but I see a time maybe 5 years down the road or less where seasoned riders use high power electric skateboards.

I think the raptor has it's place in the market, but I'm interested in more power and speed. Serious skateboards want serious eboards. And thats not the raptor.

Up until now, the biggest problem with tires on hub motors has mostly to do with deteriorating rubber. Higher duro wheels in turn are harder, deterioration and deform less, so most are using harder wheels to begin with. Hummie and I are in the process of putting a core into the rubber, which should allow us to use lower duro wheels that ride smoother.

These motors will set apart the little guys from the bigger guys. You original tests of hummies small motors were tainted by the blue goo and aluminum design. These motors mechanically are the soundest and safest design I have ever seen. Over 3000 miles and no failure that has resulting In a crash. The axle of this truck will be fail safe, as are most of the design of these motors.

Are you going to be selling a 4WD drivetrain?  This is the main way to deal with heat imo / divide it across 4 different motors - maybe could put 2000+W to the pavement without exceeding 10A each motor.

4wd and 2wd will be available.

4wd is a divide and conquer technique IMO. You split the current, thus the heat, amongst 4 motors. You don't have to push them too hard, and thus, they'll last longer. But if you need or want the extra power, you'll have it at your finger tip. 4WD is difficult right now due to the cost, it's a commitment, but I think the price will come down in the near future with the development of new electronics.

It's an exciting time for the e-skate industry right now!

cost isn't necessarily a killer (fuck, look at mellow, they've sold quite a few 4WD at 3K$$$) but my big concern there is rolling resistance x4.

the most dangerous thing about rolling resistance is when you have confidence in your acceleration and are leaning waaaay into it and you get a split-second controller dropout, turns off the throttle and you almost fall forward off the board.

THEN you get the anxiety of that happening during acceleration haha... add rolling resistance into the mix and its a recipe for trouble

The rolling resistance isn't too bad with my 4wd with the smaller hummie motors. It can be a problem, but I'm pretty calculating about my finger movement on the trigger.

I know the 4wd boards I'm working on will likely be in the $2500 price range. It does cost a lot more to make, but the improved performance is substantial IMO.

Top speed is about 30 mph right now and the new hall sensors allow me to start from a rolling backwards on a hill. So yes and yes. These are still the same small motors also. When the new motors are done, I might have a board with too much torque.

so if we cut the crap, will a belt driven 6373 setup be better than the raptor 2 up that 30 degree slope? The raptor came down to 6km/h at the end and that is basically close to stop. If the hill was any longer I guess it would have stopped. does the belt system solve this? I've only got experience with hubs and mine sucks when hills come by but are OK for most other things other than beeing very rough with only a tiny bit of urethane around the rear wheels ^^

Forgive me because most of my education on this topic is coming from this thread (yes, I just read it from start to finish), but don't you need to show the top view and just how wide your board is to prevent it from breaking at the fulcrum? That's one of my big takeaways is that the width of the belt is an important part of the equation. 

Isn't a similar comparison a Dodge hellcat with 18% parasitic loss due to the front engine and rear wheel drive transmission and a Tesla 100d and the dual direct drive motors? I much prefer the rumble of the hellcat, but there is no denying that the Tesla has the ability to deliver better performance when it comes to delivering torque to the road.

Intitial startup torque yes but that hellcat will beat it after about 10 seconds, the reason the tesla has better torque on startup is because of electricity moving faster than belts and pistons. And those hubs are going as fast as the electricity/ current reaches them

Short answer, Tesla is not direct drive. Long answer below. 

Tesla is using a geared differential. It is not direct drive. My Tesla has a small front motor and a bigger rear motor. Most of the time it's running from the smaller more efficient front motor but when I floor it putting out 300kW++ it's using both at the same time. In the winter it's also using both so my average W/km goes up by a lot compared to when running only the small front motor. 

About regen I'm not sure what engine is being used but I think both is used. I'm getting 60-70kW regen when the batteries are warm.

I think the point is that focusing only on loss of energy during transmission while ignoring mechanical advantage is not a really robust way of looking at this. It's like saying a unicycle is superior to a bike (assuming the same wheel size) for achieving high speeds because there's too much energy loss in a chain gear reduction and a unicycle has no loss because it is direct drive. This argument ignores that your legs pedal at an optimum rpm and that rpm is much slower than the rpm needed to achieve higher speeds in a bike wheel.

If the belt guys want to compete on performance they can increase the motor torque output (design better motors), but then you reach a torque transfer limit of the belt. the belt is the weak link if you want maximum power at the wheels.

**Scenario #1:** Take an outrunner motor that was initially designed for other applications and then tweak it to be better suited for electric skateboards. Use tried and true methods in belts and pulleys for gear reduction and power transmission and enjoy the ability to put any one of a number of fantastic skateboard wheels on the board. Skate wherever you want.

**Scenario #2:** Take a similar hub motor that was initially designed for other applications and then tweak it to be better suited for electric skateboards. Stick this (relatively) large, hard object inside a wheel that is designed to contain a hub motor INSTEAD of being designed to be the best wheel for a skateboard. Do your best to overcome the obvious heating issues and inherent inefficiencies as they relate to torque. Find pristine roads and smooth conditions to ride on so that the thin urethane band surrounding the 2 to 4 drive wheels doesn't rattle your teeth out.

I'm not sure why either of these scenarios would win any awards for innovation and technology. I call this adapting and improving upon what already exists for your specific needs. And there's no shame in that.

My Harley has a belt and I haven't had to service it at all. I have other motorcycles, bikes, and e-bikes, with chains, hub motors, and even one with a shaft drive. They all work fine. But they don't have motors that occupy a HUGE percentage of the wheel's interior that results in a compromised ride. I have lathes and mills with pulleys and gears but ALL of them have the ability to change the gear ratio. If you can't physically change the gear ratio, it better be accidentally perfect for whatever application you need it for right out of the box.

As someone who has spent the last 18 years of his life looking to make a skateboarder's life a little better, I've tried a number of different wheel shapes, sizes, and urethanes on a number of different size and shaped cores. For longboards of all lengths and weights, you basically CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH urethane in your system, but you can very easily have WAY TOO LITTLE. You've probably seen a picture of a 101mm Flywheel on a 70mm core or an 83mm or 92mm Flywheel on a 50mm core. There's a reason that they are in the museum and not on my boards now. Not enough urethane. You NEVER saw the 92mm Flywheel on the 70mm core because I knew that it should never see the light of day. Sasquatch sightings are more more likely.

When, as, and if someone tools up to produce a wide variety of nice PU sleeves with both a good chemical bond AND a mechanical lock for the soft wheel urethane, they'd be part way there. Then they'd have to tool up for many big and expensive wheel molds to put onto those sleeves.  Only then could someone design, source, and produce different size hub motors with a variety of different sleeve diameters and sleeve widths to correspond with the variety of hub-motor-wheels. But absent that you're going to see one or two hub motors in one or two wheels per vendor. Period. 

There's a big challenge in producing a ton of SKUs in a business. I'm the fool who currently makes 21 hanger widths (at 5mm increments from 100mm to 200mm inclusive) and has started making 210mm, 220mm, 230mm, 240mm, and 250mm heXL hangers. The same fool makes 0Â°, 5Â°, 10Â°, 15Â° 20Â°, 25Â° 30Â°, 35Â° 40Â°, 45Â° 50Â°, 55Â° and 60Â° baseplates. The same fool does many of these in a cast version that are 100% compatible with the CNC/machined parts. Oh, did I mention that we do these hangers rakeless and raked so that they can also be run flipped? Don't get me started on bushings and wheel and core sizes and shapes because then we'd have to start talking about the rockered, flat, cambered, concave, dropped, drop-through and micro-dropped decks in various lengths and materials. I've gone broke doing it, but who the hell else loves skateboarding that much and is that foolish?

I think it's great to see a number of different approaches at getting people on board electric vehicles. Most of my early contributions will be of the "mechanical" types ... wheels, pulleys, trucks, steering and damper systems (more on that later), motor mounts, collars, decks, bearings, and bushings. Although personally reluctant to go the hub-motor route, I'm happy that others are. There isn't ONE way.  And on the the chance that you want to try some bigger wheels with even more urethane and a wider contact patch, pray that I love these 107mm SuperFly's in 74a Reflex Formula urethane and that a big rich esk8 company can help keep Abec 11 alive because these are just way too f'ing nice to keep to myself ...

Hey @ChrisChaput welcome aboard....

When the little guys in the esk8 industry start influencing the product designs of the established skate companies you can be sure we are doing something right ;) (proud moment)

I think in three years we can all look back and say with more confidence who chose the correct path with esk8 drive train technology offerings and aftermarket options, I'd say there will be belts, hubs and maybe some new stuff too.. Suppose it depends on marketing a little bit also...

Do the maths, 4000 Raptor 2 customers accumulating per year, depending on riding style each year needing probably 2 or 4 outwheels each?... In 2 years that's 32,000 wheels that might be needed... Maybe 64,000 wheels consumed in 4 years from now.... And most of our customers are in USA....

Next product available from Abec11, due 2018. Aftermarket R-spec ghost outwheels ;)

@ChrisChaput you make great wheels man & your also a smart business guy... It's great to have your input and thanks for joining in on the discussion...

Still open minded to discuss business if your interested.

Regards
Jason.

Yeah, when you settle in on and commit to one or two specific hub motor diameter/widths, then some third party vendors may roll the dice and tool up for plastic injection sleeve tooling and the wheel molds. But if the motor sizes that you use today are going to change over time, someone is going get stuck with yesterday's tooling and have to make more new ones with the same risk of having THOSE be obsolesced in a year or so.

There will definitely be hub motors around for years to come. Aesthetically they can't be beat. They're like a perfect child - neither seen nor heard ;)

But the ONE thing that skaters are not too lazy to do, is to change wheels. Because there is exactly ONE locknut that stands between them and a new wheel. Bushings too. And both of those sockets are found on their $10 skate tool. Change baseplates? Oh hell no ... there are 8 locknuts and you have to hold the screw head on one side and wrench the other. Screw that. 

If you can get a fair amount of urethane on those hubs, have stellar size, shape and thane options, and make changing a wheel as easy as it is now, you'll do well. Just stay away from hill-climbing events 8-O

I hope to be working with you and anyone else who wants great thane on board. The door is always open ... 

p.s. If you have any CAD files that you want to share, I model in Solidworks 2014 and Fusion 360 and can import a number of different formats ...

That maybe true... but the market isn't skater... The market for Electric skateboard is much more bigger... Right now your are on a forum for builder, people around here stay up until the sun goes up, to do some tinkering over there board, no one around here is too lazy to unscrew 8 screw. Another of the market, is the general public people who buy pre-made board and will never do or want to do some tinkering over it, they've bought a product to work strait out of the box, and they mostly will buy part and accessories from the manufacturer, because they don,t want the hassle to fit something else. Also you want a product that don't need maintenance and unlike belt system, that have to be adjust, replace, and maintain in order to get the best experience possible, hubs offer a no maintenance system that is easy to use for everyone. The biggest disadvantage of hub is always the thin urethane.... but even if it thinner it doesn't feel like it when you got good quality urethane.... (FYI I have pass over my faire share of crack and pot hole, with those hub here in Montreal.

*Doesnt have belt problems in my opinion ;)* I see this as the 3rd option, in choices between belt drive and hub drive, of course, it does not solve other mechanical issues that might arise but at least it does not suffer from heat and other elements as much as hub motors tend to be prone to

I am a builder and I could not stand how time consuming it was to remove a bolt on pulley when changing wheels. I integrated the drive pulley into the truck hanger with machined slip-on wheel adapters to solve this problem. 
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVK2BjBjvqr/?taken-by=ollinboardco

Think of this, I can switch from 83mm to 107mm and effectively change my drive ratio by only removing 4 lock nuts. When I want to fine tune I can also change pulleys and/or switch to different motors without worrying being pigeon holed into a first generation product line that will be non-compatible quickly in a rapidly changing market.

Being able to easily modify and have cross compatible products is one of the great things about skateboarding in general. To take that away and say it is the best for everyone is crazy. Builders want to pick their own trucks, motor mounts, wheels and motors. Many who just want to buy a complete also want to be able to upgrade or switch out components when something new comes along.

I believe what the market is looking for is a board that has the speed, reliability, and run time. to drag ones butt up to the top of the mountain then allow one to freeride down then ride under power home the best of both worlds

From Vedder.se :

http://vedder.se/2014/10/chosing-the-right-bldc-motor-and-battery-setup-for-an-electric-skateboard/

_"So, regarding KV: different KV versions of the same motor are fully equivalent. KV only affects the battery and ESC choice. Therefore, while comparing motors, lets talk about torque instead of current because torque is proportional to current / KV and, as explained above, the KV value can be changed freely with the amount of turns and copper thickness._

_RPM/Losses/gear reduction_

_**Now we know that copper losses are proportional to the square of the torque produced by the motor, and at low RPM and high load they are dominant.** As RPM increases, other losses start to add up exponentially. In my experience, these losses start to get significant around 60k electrical RPM, which for a 14-pole motor is about 8570 mechanical rpm (most 50mm+ outrunners have 14 poles, some unusual ones have 18). **Because of the square relation**, it is desirable to run at as high speed and low torque as possible as long as we stay below 8.6k RPM. **To express the square relation in some numbers, having double the RPM and half the torque at a certain power output will cause four times less losses.** The lesson from this is that: make sure the top speed you design the skateboard for is at around 8.6k rpm on the motor if you are using an 50mm-60mm outrunner._

_For my longboard with 84mm wheels, where I would like to design for a top speed of about 35km/h with a sing motor, I would need a gear ratio of about: (35 / (0.084 * pi * (8600 / 60) * 3.6) = 0.257 which is 1:(1/0.257) = 1:3.9. Note that this gear ratio is independent of battery voltage and motor kv. Keep in mind that 8.6k rpm is not an exact number, but a guideline that seems to apply quite well to all 50mm-60mm hobby outrunners I have tested so far."_


Understanding the matter, you realize that the motor design doesn't have to much impact on the fact that losses build up with the amount of torque you squeeze out of a motor. If you want more torque at the same efficiency, your motor will get a lot bigger all of a sudden. Expect your comparable (to a geared system) hub motor to weigh 4KG and be huge in diameter (because of the square relation). You can't cheat the physics! Most BLDC outrunner motors are already 80-90 efficient. When plotting the efficiency graphs, you could simply assume your motor to be perfect. 

All of a sudden you start to realize that the motor design doesn't matter to much. So you end up with the fact that you need to accept the losses, which will be converted into heat. Losses = Heat and vs. So any hub motor will need the best cooling possible to shift those losses (heat) away from the stator/magnets into another part being cooled by e.g. air. In case of a skateboard this is most likely the the hanger, sitting above a potentially hot tarmac surface, since the motor can is wrapped in heat insulating urethane. 
Your losses can easily reach values as high 200-400W, especially when going slowly up an incline or ride against the blow of wind. This is why you need a twin drive to cut the torque needed in half, since copper losses are proportional to the square of the torque produced by the motor. 

So if you want to keep comparison fair, you always need to compare single drive to single drive.   
Another fact that is very often been overlooked is the following: If you managed to build a super torque rich small and light motor that could be used inside a skate wheel, it could also be used in a geared system, all of a sudden starting to perform a lot better. So in a comparison you should always compare the same motor - used inside a hub, and used in a geared setup. Anything else is cheating yourself.

Another thing that is often misunderstood are the losses of the belt drive itself. Compared to the inefficiencies of a hub, that is nothing you need to worry about. The belt system Benjamin and I tested was more than 97% efficient.
The reason why coasting is better without belt drive is not the belt drive itself. The motor inside a belt driven system is simply performing better as a regenerative brake, since it is geared. Hubs do also need to be debated from the generator point of view.

@JohnnyMeduse , You don't need to readjust belts constantly...Timing belts don't stretch. Ask any professional automotive mechanic. If they did can you imagine how many non tinkerers would have a pile of cars in their front yards?

Timing belts were around long before E-skate. I'm not saying people don't have issues with belt driven setups. They do. But all of them are related to misalignment, poorly made parts and bad technique. 

I also have to add. Is there anything better than a well made non motorized Longboard with nice trucks and good quality cushy wheels? If you spent a day out riding a perfect longboard what would be the first thing you think you could change on that board without affecting how it feels to ride it? Would you change those cushy wheels to something with less urethane and a bigger metal core? Not me.

True but if you don't take a look at your setup and adjust the belt tension, because stress and vibration are loosen up screw on you motor mount, on a daily or weekly basis you take the risk to get a broken belt. ( here is some example. )... It a process you learn from experience... but the market isn't people with experience, and they most likely get tired of it...

Ride quality is more important to me. There are a couple of different subsets here it's true. People are mostly concerned with looks and that pays the bills, but c'mon! There's no comparison when it comes to the feel of quality longboard components. You can have belted systems without compromising the ride. 

The only exception with what I'm saying is Carvon's V3 direct drive.

But we are talking about magnetic electric machines.

The permanent magnet strength, specifically the magnetic flux field strength, is a torque multiplier. Increasing Current is not the only way to increase torque output from the machine.

It seems the Vedder formula assumes all motors generate the same torque per amp. 

So is It is possible to overcome/reduce the low rpm copper losses with improvements in the motor design alone? I think it's possible and I'd be happy to be proven wrong.

For better motors esk8 designers need to start thinking about electro-mechanical engineering, not just Electric theroy.

This is why Raptor 2 can outperform belt drive systems. This is why we offer 110% performance guarantee.

Everyone said hub motors were shit, even I said that... The problem was people didn't look outside the box... 

Vedder is a smart guy but his formulas shouldn't dictate what engineers should and shouldn't try to achieve. It's time people open their minds and continue to push hard to innovate. We should be trying to prove Vedder wrong, not simply sit back & quote his comments and bury our heads in the sand.

Trial and error is a powerful formula.

Just what EXACTLY do you mean by "outperform"?

 I watch these Telsa's tear some other cars a new one off the line but then the other car blows by after a 1/4 mile or so. Which one performed better? If a board is really good for the first 1/4 mile up a hill before requiring the rider to carry it, is that okay? If a board is fast as all hell but unsafe at high speed, how do we measure its "performance". Do we care about the rider experience, such a comfort, fatigue, security, and fun, or do we just quote telemetry readings and specs off the BLDC tool? Is range the key issue? Speed? Is carving, turning, drifting, stability, and control the bigger issue? How about being fast off the line?

What about a rider being able to configure his board to perform the way the HE defines performance? Can you get a different split in truck geometry front and back? Can you switch to bigger/smaller/harder/softer wheels in a jiffy? What about cutaway deck shapes that allow for off-road wheels. Is that same motor good for EVERY wheel size, or just the one that comes with the complete?

I know that I'm different than a lot people, in that I demand a lot of options and configurations. But there are so many great ways to skate, I can't imagine that everyone would be happy with a "one size fits all" approach.

I believe that performance, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder ...

@onloop how about we keep things apples-to-apples:

Take the Raptor 2 motors out of the hubs.
Rewind them to 3 times the KV they currently are.
Put them in satellite with a 3:1 reduction. 

Hubs are better? Seriously???

Torque would be better in satellite, and top speed efficiency might be better in a hub configuration.

Who wants what?

No, to maximize performance the motor must be custom designed for the specific application, retro-fitting & adapting motors with belts (evolve) is never going to give the best performance.


[quote="ChrisChaput, post:220, topic:13330"]

I mostly disagree with that,

I suppose it needs to be defined, Objective performance VS Subjective Performance criteria.

Objective performance needs to be measurable & comparable against other objective evidence.

If you make a claim about performance, i think it is important that you can measure it. If you cannot measure it then it is not really "true" performance, it a subjective / opinion based view of performance characteristics.

EXAMPLE: a pro-Skater in the SLS league will say ABEC11 wheels are too big, heavy, soft & perform horribly for skating the streets & doing tricks. This is subjective. 

However, you could measure rolling resistance, durability/life span, top speed... That is Objective Performance Evidence and hard to argue against.

I am not trying to say one method is better than another method. At this stage everything can be improved.


**I am simply saying this.**

1. Raptor 2 hub motor design is doing things that most people assumed was not possible with hub motors. I am trying to change the conception of the market that hub motors are shit. I think my videos are very good evidence that the market has mis-conceptions about hub motors, I believe the Raptor 2 is proof that hub motors can work very well in esk8.

2. I am also saying that It's very likely that the results we are seeing are due to the motor design improvements. Its not magic, we designed an improved motor & got improved results. Simple, anyone can do this with R&D, time & money.

3. Finally, The Raptor 2 will outperform all existing commercially available mass produced electric skateboards that use hub motors. It probably beats most satellite motor setups too. This is why we offer 110% performance promise.



----------


----------


EXAMPLE: If we make a competition, specifically to see what electric skateboard has the most torque that the wheels I would have two options,

1. Take my hub motors & install a 20mm+ wide belt & pulley and take advantage of the mechanical torque multiplier gain by using huge reduction gearing.

OR

2. Make a better/bigger hub motor.

Eventually, there will be a clear winner, the design constraints of one approach will be the limiting factor eventually.... I haven't done this exercise so i don't actually know what the best drive train is for esk8... All i know is that i have achieved some amazing results & probably shocked lots of people who didn't think it was possible.

If we make a competition to see which esk8 can achieve the highest top speed, the design will be different again.

Each performance criteria, torque, speed, heat, weight, etc can be a single focus for the engineer, but eventually, we want a good all round performer that is reliable with minimal maintenance that does everything very well.

That is why I believe hub motors will eventually dominate the industry. I am more than happy to be proven wrong on this :)

Take an Inboard M1 hub motor - weigh it.

Take a Raptor 2 hub motor - weigh it. 

Performance from a power / torque stand point would likely proportionate to the weight difference as a percentage - assuming battery and programing are the same.

Comparing hubs and belts without the same motor, battery, and programming is a marketing joke IMO.

Hubs and Belts are different, and have their places - both will be around for a long time.

Stay tuned for more episodes Marketing & Posturing...

To summarize: Horses for courses...

You got know what you want from your board and where you ride it.
Some questions you could ask yourself are:

- Are your roads rough?
- Do you face steep hills often?
- How is the climate in your country (hot, cool, ambient)?
- What is your weight?
- Do your feet go tired soon, riding a board? 
- Do your feet/legs accept vibrations?
- Do you want flex in the deck?
- Do you want to use your preferred wheels and shore hardness?
- Do you want your board to look like a regular, non electric board?
- Do you want the best possible acceleration (even up a hill)? 
- Do you want the best coasting experience?
- Do you want max range?
- Are you a beginner, average rider, pro?
- Do you want to use your preferred deck/trucks?
- Are you a speed freak or do you enjoy cruising and carving?
- Do you want to win Pikes Peak or a drag race?
- etc. etc. 

These questions need to be answered by yourself before making a decision. Very often it happens that you want to combine things that you can't without accepting a compromise. Designing and riding boards for almost 15 years now, I have an advantage in making my decision. @ChrisChaput probably has his own opinion about urethane wheels, since he knows everything about them and tried out a lot. He probably loves that ultimate smoothness in the ride and the sound of top notch thick urethane attached to a pro board. So you will probably not see him flying past you on hubs, 
since his toenails would curl in horror.

Users, being new to e-boarding, do not have our experience. They often buy on visual impression and promises. This is a bonus for hubs. Experienced riders will consider more factors, but could still end up on hubs or a geared setups. Again, horses for courses and personal preferences....

Personally I prefer 

- max. vibration dampening 
- nice flex in the deck 
- Personally I love pneumatics, since they are a big relief for your feet and bones and you can even ride on cobble stone  roads with ease and a smile on your face.
- I do also like urethane wheels with high rebound, using a thick layer of urethane, especially when carving down the relatively rough concrete airport runways.
- Fantastic acceleration and range - I love to know that the battery lasts for 40-60Km.
- I ride mostly on flat terrain, so I ride a single drive, having only one ESC and motor to care about.
- I like things to stay as cool as possible, even when pushing my limits.
- I love powerful twin drive MTBs for off road fun and touring (how could I not). 
- I still love the appearance of hubs (everyone probably does).

I know that I am in the comfortable position to be able to build every board I can dram of. Not everyone can afford three boards, nor does everyone have the knowledge and skills to achieve what skilled DIYers can achieve.

Horses for courses is my conclusion. The more informed the customer is, the better he can make his decision. 
So we will try our best to serve each customer with the perfect board, according his abilities, weight, terrain and purpose of usage. In some cases a hub might even be a good choice, depending on your personal preferences, path and the climate you live in. There is no one shoe fits all. 
 
"Are hub motors worse" is to simplifying.

@onloop I've said what i came here to say. 

I'm not getting into this argument because people are making money selling their particular solution so that solution will only ever be the right one for the people who have the money to market it. 

And hubs are cheaper and easier to manufacture and assemble on the board than belt systems. Let's just make that part clear because when it comes to selling electric skateboards, or any fucking other thing for that matter, shaving time off of assembly and shaving parts of the list is about saving money and making money. ITs not about performance. It's partially about reliability. Its all about money. Its not about creating a custom experience for the rider unless you've got a pile of various KV rated stators sitting on your shelf ready to dial it in for that one guy with his one application. And if its not about getting the rider exactly what they want, then what's it about?

You've had a vast amount of success leveraging the DIY community to build your completes, and now you're gradually moving (while still popping in now and then and keeping the forums going and providing a lot of content and good info and luring people into the sport) toward being a factory touring suit who used to skate and still looks good in a muscle shirt. Don't do that. Stay here. We want you here. This pattern of invent something, use it to make money and invent something else, then talk shit about the old thing and how it never made any damned sense so you can sell your new thing.. its almost a circle jerk of marketing. And now seminars on how.. to sell.. and market... WTF even are you anymore?

I swear to god if you go pyramid scheme on us and sell books on esk8s that tell you how to sell books on esk8s i will swim to Australia and beat your ass with a broken gen 1 raptor deck. Don't forget where you came from.

Dude, ride a Raptor 2 then lets talk....

alternatively, watch this video

https://youtu.be/DUaTo2k4hnc

Tell me you are not slightly curious about R-SPEC GHOST hub motors now? I wouldn't have believed this was possible 12 months ago....nobody did!

_Are you impressed by this performance the slightest bit?_


1. They look awesome.
2. No maintenance.
3. No need to align belts.
4. No need to adjust tension.
5. Can swap out to different urethane designs easily.
6. More torque at the wheels compared to 9mm belt drive.
7. 30% Hill climb ability.
8. Fully closed design. No sticks, rocks, dirt can't enter the motor.
9. Motor Hidden inside wheel, protected from damage by debris.
10. Faster to install.
11. Same cost as our previous R-SPEC outrunner motors.
12. Steel structure for incredible strength.
13. Larger bearings to handle loads better.
14. Improved cooling methods.
15. Precision Trucks for improved handling.

The only negative people can come up with is the urethane is too thin....Lucky we are running premium urethane on the front where most of the rider weight is!............. if that's the only complaint people can come up with I'd say i have absolutely nailed it!

@Blasto I think you should weigh in here. Based on your posts I'm assuming you're one of the engineers on the Enertion team behind the motor and you probably have the most data since you've had the R2 hub since Feb. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/esk8-dyno-testing/18168

Did anything come out of your tests? Is your drive more efficient than existing belt drives? Is less heat produced on sustained high speed on flats? On hills? On long rides over 5 miles? In belt drive systems, is the belt the weakest link in improving performance?

I did 25% grade hills on hubs a year ago while still maintaining 20 mph. I said back then hubs are the future. I knew a slightly larger motor with sensors was going to mean I could climb 30% + hills.

That videos a little deceptive too. 30% for a portion, but not the entire hill.

If you want me to show you some hills in San Francisco that are 30% grade for 1000 ft or so, I'd be more than happy. I would say based on the tests I've seen in video so far, the raptor 2 motors are close in strength to hummies v3 motors.

One thing we do agree on, hubs are the future. Hubs will shine through this year!

Ok i'm through having an esk8 family crisis. 

No hub motors are not worse. They're just not tunable and that's wholly against my business model. 

Modular hubs with swappable stators are the next logical step. I expect to see that next year and I better get first dibs since i came up with it in my head months ago while drinking a lot of fruity alcoholic drinks.

What?! So running esk8s at downhil speeds you should have different expectations from your components? This is where experience comes in to play...

Are you serious? Do you really believe that there is an area of longboarding where a rough feeling ride and having less traction and control "is a pretty minor thing"? That is whacked. The essence of longboarding is a great feeling ride.

Shortboarders endure the horrible feeling wheels and trucks that don't turn and the 14.5" wheelbases that forces you stand in a (relatively) unstable position because doing a flip trick is their holy grail and they need "landing gear" more than something that goes fast and is stable and comfortable at speed. They will try and ollie or kickflip your electric board and when they fail they'll tell you your board sucks. Popsicle stick flip trick decks are great at what they're designed to do. But they can't even come close to a longboard when it comes to enjoying nice carves, cruising, commuting, and cornering at speed.

And although I'm not the only downhiller who rides and electric skateboard, only a small percentage of the builders here know what it's like to do over 60mph on a skateboard, or streetluge, or buttboard, in packs and on roads where you have to decelerate down to 20mph just to make the turn. And those who have know what I know - that many/most of the requirements of a high-performance electric skateboarding are those that are required in downhill. You need the confidence that comes from stability, traction, and control, and/or the ability to drift under control. You're not always going fast, but when you are, you want to be under control. When the ass end of your board is hitting imperfections and dancing around on its own, you aren't in control. And not unlike downhill boards, when things get out of control on an electric skateboard, it's rarely easy to it them back under control. They can't counter-steer. They are brutally unforgiving. You're a split second from eating shit at any given moment. This is why we are able to beat our cheats are act like total death-defying studs. We manage to overcome all of the inherent deficiencies in a small-wheeled lean-steer vehicle. And that counts. We want recognition.  But let's be honest here. We don't need to add to the deficiencies so that we can beat our chests harder. Do you really want to be the only guy on a hard-tailed mountain bike when the terrain demands a full suspension bike? Do you want telemark skis on a slalom course or for downhill? They have a place in the skiing world, just not where the fastest of the fast meet up. 

I fully understand that there is this thing called "good enough for most casual consumers" and that good enough is good enough. But I think that it's a bit reckless and maybe even dangerous to put a ton of power into something that can't stay in control of at high speed.

I've been riding my Carvon hubs and the thane is pretty thin except for the outer edge. For just straight riding around town. It's not bad at all, even at higher speeds. The ride is a little rougher since our streets suck here, but it's not unstable in the least bit. I'd prefer full thickness, but hubs offer a ride feel that I like even with the compromise. Of course I'll be upgrading to the V3's when they come out so I won't have to anymore. If you're carving hard, the outer lip has full thickness and deforms enough to keep hold so I'm all good. The full thickness outer edge is the reason I went with Carvon hubs. For the casual rider, or short commuter, if you're not carving hard, have smooth streets, hubs with thinner thane is not all that bad.   

9 out of 10 esk8ers I meet on the street have never skated before and are doing just fine going in straight lines in the 12-18mph range. I'm not saying there isn't a lot of us that require a lot more from our boards, but from what I see, we are at a minority compared to those out there buying pre-made boards. Just think about the success Enertion has had selling their Raptor 2. Anyone who is an experienced skater who pushes their abilities would look at the thickness of the thane at the edge and see how that wouldn't work as well as full thickness thane once you enter into a hard carve or that it won't cushion rough pavement. Still they are selling very very well. Think about how many boards Boosted is selling. High speeds on a flexible deck?? 

I'm not saying having full thickness thane isn't important and we shouldn't be demanding better quality and safety from those who manufacture boards. I'm just saying that most esk8ers from what I see, are not doing anything on their boards where hubs with thinner thane wouldn't be good enough. "good enough for most casual consumers" is the key. That includes practically zero of us. Putting tons of power into something you can't control at high speeds. Yes, I agree that's reckless, but that doesn't mean a hub with thin thane isn't good enough to tool around the city, get to class, or skate around the path on the weekends.

Moonlight is pretty dull and I guess you are to I am 64 and I want to carve as hard as my knees n Bones will let me! I ride my sk8 for the adrenaline.i don't get a lot of adrenaline having my fillings vibrate out my teeth,i have never ran up to my bud and said wow did you see the bogus carve get real, I know my bro,s we don't settle for ok it's about finding what really works an perfecting it

The V2 or V2.5 carvon hubs you have ride much much better than all the other hubs that have been available thus far. U were already riding the best hubs on the market. If you tried the other hub motors on the market like jacobs or any of the chinese boards you'd realize what everyone else is saying is true. The vibration is really intense, almost unbearable for more than a few mins at a time.

Interesting point. I've only been riding Carvon's. 

When I've taken my hubs apart, the thane is pretty thin except for the small section at the end. So for the most part, I'm riding on the thin thane like other hubs. You definitely feel the difference between the thin thane and full thickness when you ride. On the Carvon's it's a very noticeable difference, but it's not bad. I didn't think others would feel all that different if you weren't carving. Especially with all the claims everyone makes. As for being the best hubs on the market, I hear a lot of people claiming their's are better, but I chose Carvon's because I like having that full thickness outer edge when carving hard. Plus Jerry is cool as f*ck. 

It could be that small bit out outer edge that makes all the difference or it could be the quality of everything else on the Carvon's on top of that. Either way, for the most part, I'm not riding on full thickness thane, so there has to be some sort of midpoint or compromise where it's good enough for most riders. It's not all about thinner thane not making the cut, because it does work on the Carvon hubs. There's a clear difference and my setup with full thickness 90's grips better, has a smoother ride, and can hold an edge better, but the Carvon's with less thane still rides pretty nice.

"What?! So running esk8s at downhil speeds you should have different expectations from your components? This is where experience comes in to play..."

I'm saying that most people don't ride their esk8's at downhill speeds. Even the top production esk8's out there top out around 24mph in ideal conditions. Consistently going 25-35mph+ on a skate is a different ballgame and beyond the capabilities of most esk8's.

Aren't Carvon's essentially just flywheels mounted on the motor? This would give you the same thane as anyone else running flywheels on satellite configs.

The carvons feel good because the duro is pretty low and the thane is in tack. Just went for a ride with 4wd of the v2 carvons. Floating on clouds in my book.

The wide wheel hummie and I are going to use might also help with the feeling, as the contact patch is much larger. The front wheels will be an abec centrax wheel :slight_smile:

@Mrmoonlight I agree in part, the Carvon V2's werent nearly as good as the 97mm Abec 11's on my Carbin GT but yhey ride much much better than the onan X2, the original jacob hubs and the pair of 70mm chinese hubs I bought and thats not while carving, thats just rolling. I think it does have to do with the full thickness thane on the ends because my Torqueboards hubs have a similar full thickness section and they also roll pretty smooth.

I lose about half the thickness of thane on my 90's. They are bored out to roughly a mm before the outer edge of where the outside bearing sit. They ride nice.

On the left is what you get when you ride a Carvon V3, the middle is a V2 (59mm hub motor in some of the wheel), and what I imagine a 63mm diameter x 74mm wide hub motor is in a 90mm wheel. Urethane depth printed in each cross section.

Got thane?

Actually, you lose less than a third (7 % 22.5) of the urethane for some, but not all, of the wheel. Jerry's design intent was to preserve as much urethane as he could, and he did that even more so in the V3.

Agree 100% Chris, any consumer reading this should be very worried about keeping control & riding safely! 
**They should choose a hub motor fully enclosed & protected by urethane that offers maximum ground clearance.**

Streeting your face at 60mph because a half-inch-pebble destroys your exposed motor, that is fully exposed & positioned just a few mm from the ground, is very hefty price to pay for an extra few mm of Thane

@ChrisChaput I think you are a super passionate guy who loves making high-quality skate stuff, you know your shit, that is undeniable! However, I think you need to step back a bit, your walls of text about why your wheels are superior to everything else is becoming hard to swallow. 

**You are clearly biased, you have a business that needs to sell wheels & you are now in bed with carvon.**

Please take a breath and listen to the consumer and maybe you will learn something too.

Or you can just do what Carvon is already doing which is to put a protective band of urethane around the OD of the direct drive motor which is spinning at the identical rate as that rotating mass of urethane that I call a wheel which, btw,  was designed to be a skateboard wheel and not a hub motor cover. 

Jerry has already gone through a number of design iterations and has some pretty clever solutions to what some may only  see as a problem. Maybe when his crew goes to grind at the skatepark (the holy grail of electric skateboarding) it won't make a gnarly enough grinding noise and this will be thought to be very uncool by the local hipsters.

My sprocket bottomed out on the log I was trying to ride over on my mountain bike. Should I throw the bike away or maybe not try and ride over sideways logs?

You claim your hubs are superior every day! Why can't he do the same? "Practice what you preach!" You also claim a "110% performance guarentee" but then charge a 20% restocking fee and make the buyer pay return shipping? Not to mention everywhere you bloat about the FOCBOX being "open source" when you don't even release the design files? Just some PDF's? 

I call a spade a spade and I think everyone needs to take a breath here.

1. Never once have I claimed that me wheels are superior to everything else. Get your facts straight and stop spinning.

2. Of course I'm biased. Duh. I would be entirely impossible for me to be 100% unbiased. Being unbiased is not the goal. As long as I use real world experiences and testing I can tell which of my theories hold water and which should be scrapped. By getting involved in just about every aspect of skateboarding, I have a more open mind and have a broader perspective than most owner/designers. I don't fall so in love with my ideas that I can't kill them off if and when they aren't viable.

3. It's because I DO listen to customers, competitors, racers, peers, friends, and people in other industries that I have learned as much as I have. That and being willing to try new things, fail, and go back to the drawing board.

4. If I'm "in bed" with Carvon, it must be a pretty big bed. Because I've worked with Carvon, Ollin, Psychotiller, MetroBoard, Z-Board, Evolve, and virtually anyone who wants to make great products. And none of them have to be wrong or low-tech for me to feel good about what I'm doing. You actually have no idea whatsoever my "big play" is in this space. When it's revealed you might learn something too.

5. I'm not surprised that you describe other skaters as "consumers". It's all about selling something. Sure I want to be able to make enough money so that I can continue to have skateboarding be my "job", but that is NOT what motivates me.

The V3's look awesome. It'll be nice to be able to rotate my wheels as my drive wheels always get worn down the most. The V3's also solve the issue with most of the wheel not being connected to the motor on the V2's. It doesn't seem to affect the ride in any way, but it definitely has worn down my wheel faster in a reverse cone. 

If the key to making Hubs ride better is more thane, it shouldn't be that hard to go from 90's to 97's. On a 63mm motor, that would give you 20.5mm of thane. Probably enough where you could ride the outer edge while carving and maintain a decent grip. That's 3.5mm more thickness than a set of Kegels which feel pretty nice for a push board or Esk8.
