I stumbled across this remote-receiver on HK

http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=92508

Now what is interesting about this is the receiver is that it has a 2A brushed car esc intergrated. I dont really care about the esc it's self, just the fact the ppm on one of the channels is decoded to control a h-bridge... Connect that h-bridge on the adc pins of the vesc. Now you have cruise control... Possibly

I'll try it out, you know, for science

Sounds interesting, could you hook up another esc to the receiver and still use the "cruise control"?
