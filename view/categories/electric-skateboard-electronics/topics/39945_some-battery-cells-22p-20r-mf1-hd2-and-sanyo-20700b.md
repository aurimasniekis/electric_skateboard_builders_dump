For hub motors, 22P 20R MF1 HD2 and sanyo 20700B work great.
Sanyo 20700B battery cells are hard to get from the market. Many battery factory don't even know about it. Its the battery cells for Tesla Model3.
5C cells, 22P and MF1 are most commenly used.  They are both good, but with 10S2P configuration, and hit current as high as 22 Amps, They have obvious voltage sag issue.  
10C cells, 20R and HD2 are what I tried and works GREAT. HD2 has slightly better performance than 20R, 
When chosing BMS, its important to make sure the BMS (which is often build inside the battery pack) specification is safe enough,  for example, your board work at 42V 30A , then you'd better get a BMS work for 50V and 40A.  

In my cases, batteries break long before they reach their recycle life times (300 times around).
The most comen break is losing soliding or cable caused by vibriation in riding.  Extra soliding and a good way to hold the battery in battery case and avoid rattle/move is important.
