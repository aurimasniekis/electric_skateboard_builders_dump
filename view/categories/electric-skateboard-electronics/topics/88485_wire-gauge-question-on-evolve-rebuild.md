I'm wiring in a new BMS and unity on an Evolve GT.  I'm swapping out the old connector from the battery with an XT60 so it can connect to the Unity and was wondering if I need to beef up the wire guage to support 200kv motors or if the original evolve wiring is sufficient.

200kv has nothing to do with wiregauge. Whats the AWG on the wire?

Thanks - I'm referencing 200kv because I figure those motors draw more amps than the original ones.  I'm not sure what gauge these original wires are...maybe 12 but not 100% sure.  Was hoping someone might know offhand.

Specs on motor are:
No load current: 0.9A
No load speed: 7220rpm
Max current: 46A
Max power: 1650W

Maybe a better question would be what is the minimum gauge I should use?

```
14g wire is standard on evolves, 12g is fine for your set up
