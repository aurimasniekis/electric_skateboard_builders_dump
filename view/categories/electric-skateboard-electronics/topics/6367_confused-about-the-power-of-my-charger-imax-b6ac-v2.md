Like many of you iÂ´m using the [IMAX B6AC V2](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__58285__IMAX_B6AC_V2_Professional_Balance_Charger_Discharger.html) to charge my 5S Batterys.

Although the max charge power is claimed to be 50 watts, i can set the charger to charge my 5S Batterys with 6A, which is more than twice the claimed power (21 V * 6A = 126 watts).

Has anyone an explanation for this?

If you charge 1s it could go 50A (probably). Anyway the amps should be diminished as you're practically charging 5 batteries at the same time.

You can set a charger to charge with 6A but because it wont get 6A it will just charge with provided wattage!
