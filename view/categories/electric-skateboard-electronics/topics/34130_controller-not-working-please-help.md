I was taking my board out for a ride and i rode for about a mile and my board stopped working, i plugged it in bldc tool and it was all okay, motor spins and everything but my remote wouldnt give a signal, i tried my other remote too and that did not work aswell, no faults, just no remote output and i dont know what to do

Try turning off ppm and uart in application tab, restart, enable ppm or ppm and uart, restart, test
Check that ppm wire didn't get ripped out
