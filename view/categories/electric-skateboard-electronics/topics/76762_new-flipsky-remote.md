This looks like a nice way to add a polished look and feel to DIY builds (at least over my mini-RC remote): https://flipsky.net/collections/accessories/products/flipsky-remote-vx1

The newest DIYEBOARD remotes finally with a receiver , if you want to know how they feel and throw jsut ask anyone with a prebuiltwith the usual accommodating each of the non receiver version

I've used this controller on one of the diyeboard escs before. In terms of input and feel it is on par with the nano style controllers. Battery life was good and experienced no interference or cutouts. Although that doesn't really so much; It's impossible to say how it will work with a vesc untill someone plugs it in and gives it a go.

I don't know electronics but would a program be possible where the vesc would get to know the battery's voltage drop in relation to the current draw (which I imagine would be pretty regular if in ok weather) then it could pick up on an irregular decrease in voltage under a known current draw and be a sign of a problem with the likely reason being a cell or cells had been disconnected or if it was really accurate could tell if the cell had been over discharged or even maybe over charged as the pid valve goes and disconnect the cell?  Probably could catch every possible fail scenario.  It could havee different data for dif temp

What I’m really interested in is how to still get telemetry from the slave vesc while connected to this remote on the master vesc and both of slave and master are connected through CANBUS. 

I have the same issue with the photon remote. It’s very strange that this remote connects though the tx rx port but doesn’t give telemetry.

@blasto When you connect to the vesc via uart do you need to program any throttle mapping in the vesc tool? If yes under which tab is it under as the only thing under the tab uart is the buad rate.

They said they don't use CAN. In fact they don't use TX at all and you can completely disregard that. VESCs have to be set to UART control. The only benefit I see to using UART is the reverse feature... which I don't care too much about. Probably going to hook it up PPM myself.

So if I wanted to hook this up to the Focbox Unity my best option would be through PPM? I have no idea on the differences between control methods (PPM vs UART). I have a mini remote but I am definitely interested in a thumbwheel remote that I don't have to calibrate every time I turn on. 

I wonder how the battery voltage will work with 11s... probably just set it to 10 or 12s and rely on my board's meter for accuracy like I do now. What do y'all think? Guess it will be one more reason to eventually upgrade to 12s. Thanks to everyone who pre-ordered this remote for science!

Just received my VX1 remote this morning. I haven't connected it yet, will have to wait until after work.

What I will say is that in the hand this feels like a significant step up from the generic 2.4G nano remote they sell. The casing feels much more robust, and the finish is really nice. The thing I'm most excited about is the electronic on/off switch. I've really had enough of slide switches after my flipsky nano and DIY firefly remotes.

Ok I love this remote so far.

I had to muck about a bit to get a connection to the positive battery terminal. Tried going off the voltmeter port on the unity, but didn’t work, which is weird cos it works for my voltmeter display. Maybe something to do with not running on the same ground as everything else?

...anyway I spliced the voltage connection into my charging circuit and it’s running good now.

I was having this annoying issue with the flipsky nano where the on/off switch was cutting out randomly, causing it to lose calibration. This meant I was always sketched about using my brakes cos the uncalibrated remote would treat any braking as 100% brakes and lock up my wheels. I think it was having connection dropouts as well.

The flipsky VX1 remote doesn’t require calibration with every use, and it has a huuuge range. It’s crazy, I was controlling my board from outside my house on the street - about 25m and through a few walls.

Real world test tomorrow.

Yeah, mine works. Basically “green” mode limits throttle to 50%, “orange” limits to 66%.

I’m just using mine through PPM though. Not sure if the speed modes work differently via UART. 

Also, not sure if you have to do an initial remote calibration on 6.6, but I used the remote calibration tool on my unity. If you do, make sure you’re in “red” mode when you run calibration.

Just tried the VX1 remote out on my commute to work this morning. I can confirm that it does not need to be recalibrated for each use.

The real world range is not as far as when I was bench testing, but easily sufficient for purpose. Full disclosure, I have a carbon fibre skinned deck, and carbon fibre enclosure... so yeah, my board is basically designed to prevent a connection between remote and receiver.

Throttle/brake feels good, maybe a little on the safe side which is a good thing, I'm just used to very touchy remotes. I was particularly wary of it this morning probably because my last two remotes were unpredictable little sh*ts, but I imagine once I'm used to how the VX1 responds I won't even think about it. Every remote has a different throttle feel, so there's always going to be a period of getting comfortable/familiar with a new remote.

That's odd, i setup mine in the VESC android app in the red/fast mode on the remote too but the wheel spins at the same max speed regardless of the mode I am in....

I tried both PPM and UART and I get the same outcome...

## \#65 Posted by: Scream Posted at: 2019-03-27T01:06:39.348Z Reads: 367

```
Hmmm... I don't know about max wheel speed, but it was clear from the throttle bar on the unity UI that slow mode is 50% throttle and medium is around 66%.

Do you think maybe the speed modes don't actually affect max speed, they're more acceleration (i.e. how fast it gets to top speed)? I think I might have read that somewhere.

I think if I held my remote at 50% throttle on a smooth, flat surface my board would eventually get to top speed. I normally push throttle to accelerate, then release it a bit once I get to desired speed.

I can kinda understand what they mean in the context of what I was posting above.

If you're bench testing the remote, the wheels are spinning with minimal resistance. You'd find they will reach max speed with very minimal throttle input. With your weight plus the weight of the board the motors have to overcome a greater resistance, so more power is required to accelerate. As your speed increases momentum kicks in and you require less power to maintain that speed, and only slightly more power to increase it - yet your speed is obviously higher than when you first started. Then you hit a hill, and you have to ramp up the throttle again, even though you're going slower again.

If the throttle directly correlated to speed you'd never get a smooth ride.

```
To connect to my Unity I used the PPM connection. You should be able to use the servo cable that came with the Unity. To read the board voltage there is an additional blue wire that comes with the PPM wires - you connect this to V on the receiver and to the positive terminal on your battery.

![image|690x399](upload://sd3oPLoizwrYQlgR5XmiB7zmRzv.jpeg) 

Apparently the only benefit of UART over PPM is reverse , and ain't nobody got time for dat. However if you wanted to go UART connection to unity I think the wiring match for the unity is the single V4 vesc. Full disclosure - **I cannot confirm if this works** - it's just the one that gets the TX and RX the right way around for the unity. You still have to do the voltage wire separate - it's the white wire which isn't connected to the UART JST.

Yes you can don't connect to bt if you don't want to, just connect using the traditional ppm method :+1:

The only difference between Bluetooth and ppm is only the reverse function :slight_smile:

So just to be clear, there is a Bluetooth module that comes with the Unity - that isn’t affected at all.

If you’re talking about connecting an additional Hm-10 module or metr pro, I believe these connect via the UART/comm port on the unity.

If you connect the flipsky vx1 receiver to the PPM/servo port on the unity, the UART/comm port would be free to plug in a Bluetooth module. 

I recommend PPM connection for unity. Can’t confirm that UART even works, and all you’d potentially gain by using it is the reverse functionality.

EDIT just realised you’re not talking about unity. Sorry 😐

Looks like you could use PPM on FSESC 6.6 though, and leave the COMM port free for a Bluetooth module. Order the PPM wiring kit and connect it to port 7 on this diagram (on your master esc), not port 1.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth

^^ both are actually operating in the 2.4GHz range (this is one of the bands open to use by manufacturers by the FCC without reserving/licensing channels, called the ISM band, [industry science medical band]).  I get what you mean though basically Bluetooth or not Bluetooth (some other protocol), the nrf24 based boards/chips use a couple different protocols for the wifi communication

https://www.nordicsemi.com/?sc_itemid=%7B36BDC7E1-5E35-4967-8B4D-E41DCD96512F%7D

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT_(network)

Generally speaking the nrf24 is good in terms of being easy to communicate with using a simple MCU like the Atmel 328 popular in Arduinos since you can talk to it with serial peripheral interface (SPI) without needing to have a MCU that can have a whole bluetooth stack running (ESP32 is a multicore arduino compatible hardware that has bluetooth and wifi built in but extra core is helpful to run all the radio hardware communication).  Basically nrf24 is acting as a bit of a co-processor handling all the details of transmitting/receiving packets and then communicating that over some serial lines back and forth with a simple MCU.

---

Also in general I think bluetooth will have more latency from the overhead of the protocol compared with something simpler but is probably a bit more robust in terms of not losing data (not really a problem with control input though, multiplayer games use UDP which loses data in the interest of lower latency most of the time from what I understand).

Also also in general bluetooth appears to have higher bandwidth at least in the newer versions of Bluetooth (3.0+)

The VESC itself allows PPM, Analog, NRF, (wii) Nunchuck, and UART as inputs so it is widely compatible with various types of controllers but you need to connect wires to the correct pins and configure the input with the VESC-Tool.  Can't speak to the qualities of the remote, but in general the VESC can accept a wide range of inputs.

Yah don't see any reason it wouldn't really.  Limits are just based on components used on the VESC I believe most of them on the 4.x based hardware are limited to 60V so most people keep the battery at 10S, adventurous types might run 12S.

Yeah sorry mate I should’ve tested it with the v4 wiring before sealing everything up. I’ve glued the servo and voltage cables to my receiver with hot glue now.

You could always just order it with the v4 wire and give it a go. If it doesn’t work, the servo cable that comes with the unity is exactly the same as the non-vesc cable so you’ll be able to get it working in one way or another.

Yeah definitely. In any case, I’m pretty sure getting rx and tx round the wrong way isn’t gonna fry anything. The one you gotta be super mindful of is the high voltage wire - as @Jinra said. Just refer to your unity schematic and the markings on the receiver when wiring up.  

If anyone reading this has got the VX1 working with UART on a unity, please chime in to confirm.

The PPM setting on the unity UI does allow you to select between forward/brake and forward/reverse... but I dunno if I’d want my board flying off in reverse any time I applied full brakes.

I just used the remote for the first ride. Having all the LED's displaying basic information is nice, but somehow the remote feels like a colorful glowing toy. I wish you could turn the battery indicator on and off. It's nice that you don't have to calibrate  each time, but the throw is similar to the Nano X,  the last 25% do nothing. I was also hoping for a signal loss vibration warning but only the LED starts flashing. If you are on a budget it's a slight update to the Nano X , if you want a much improved remote you need to look somewhere else.

that's just how the VESC works, it modulates current, not duty cycle (though you can set it to do duty if you want). More throttle == more acceleration not more speed. That last 25% does do something, but only if you really want to punch it. I prefer this method of control myself.

No it’s not my experience. 

I’ve had a firefly remote and a flipsky nano. I think the flipsky nano might be quite similar to the nano-x.

The VX1 has a shorter throw than the firefly, but a longer throw than the flipsky nano.

Just my opinion, but when I read complaints about remotes having too short throw, or being too sketchy, I think calibration issue. I have a huge throw on my firefly remote. It’s so long I can’t actually roll the throttle from full brake to full throttle without repositioning my thumb on the wheel. The actual feel when riding is not that different from the vx1. The usable throttle range is obviously shorter, but it provides enough variety in acceleration to allow you to dial in speed without throwing yourself off.

I dunno maybe I’ve just dialled in the precision of my thumb after my sketchy flipsky nano experience. My remote kept switching off and on again without my knowing (dodgy switch)... this meant it had almost no throw - just full throttle or full brake. As a result I am very gentle on the throttle and brake.

FS nano and nano-x are the exact same remote with a different enclosure.

FWIW i have no problems with the throw on the nano remotes. They work fine for me and I don't even end up full throttling often. I like the minimal movement of my thumb to control my acceleration. Nice to know the VX1 doesn't have a shorter throw than that though.

All features confirmed working with just PPM, including cruise control (freezes current ppm value, only freezes positive values). The three riding modes are as follows

* Red (default) = 100% throttle
* Orange = 70% throttle
* Green = 50% throttle

pulsewidth values are as follows

* Max = 1.90
* Center = 1.52

I haven't tested UART yet, though I may never test it. Voltage reading seems decently accurate as well. One quirk was that I charged my remote fully last night and today when I checked remote battery during configuration it was at 3/4 bars.

Yup, right on!

One thing with the battery voltage in PPM setup is that the voltage wire is on its own single jst connector. It’s very easy for a single connection like that to wiggle free as it doesn’t have the tension of the other pins to keep it in place. Mine came loose after one decent ride. I’d recommend gluing everything in place once its functional. I used hot glue.

EDIT: just realised you were talking about remote voltage not board voltage... ignore me! 😔

Well that's annoying, the voltage of the remote settles enough after charging to where it pretty much always says 3/4 bars on the remote battery. I'll check what voltage it settles to when I get home. Either it's settling WAY below 4.2v or the manual is wrong (probably the latter) as it says 75%-100% = 4 bars

I definitely get 4 bars after charging and that holds for a while. I don’t check voltage often, but I’ve only seen 4/4 bars and 2/2 bars, except when the remote arrived it was at 3/4 bars.

I wonder if you might have a faulty battery or meter? I sorta want to say no big deal, but remote voltage is kinda one of those things you don’t need to know until you really do need to know!

Hmmm... I know my board battery voltage does that actually... well something similar. 

Anything less than like 95% voltage is showing as 3/4 bars. That’s kinda dumb because it’s like 1/4 of the functionality of the battery meter is wasted.

Are your remote voltage meters working after that though? Like further drain goes to 2/4 then 1/4? I’m charging mine right now so I’ll let you know what happens. 

Tbh I probably just checked it a couple of times after charging and then not again until a few rides later.

Hmm thank you all for the continued feedback. Interesting that the board voltage on the remote is not showing up as the standard quarters. I wonder if it would appear MORE accurate if I set up my 11s pack on the 10s setting? Currently it sits at 4 bars for a long time then exponentially drops to 3, 2, 1 on the meepo esc.

I really want to get one and set up my Unity. 75˚F and sunny and my birthday but still recovering :persevere:

Mine finished charging a few hours ago. It’s showing four bars now, but it has been turned off all this time.

I’ll go for a ride after work, see what it registers after and then measure actual voltage.

I just now charged (until light was off) and measured voltage, read 4.11v. Then i plugged it back in and red light came on again.

EDIT: So one of my remotes stops charging at 4.1v and the other stops at 4.17v. I guess they're just pretty shitty batteries. I measured potentially upgrades and these might fit the bill. The only dimension i'm not sure of is the height, the stock battery is 7mm.

I charged mine overnight switched it on several times, now it's 10h after the charge and still on 4 bars.\
However I placed the reciever on the same spot as my old remote and after 60km of usage I get random acceleration and braking. I still haven't had the time to trouble shoot. Either the reciever is more sensitive to interference from battery leads etc. or something else is messed up. Will update once I know more.

Two things I can conclude is

I found the culprit, it was indeed a loose connection. One of the crimps inside the JST-PH connector came loose.\
@Jinra my remote remains at 4 bars after more than 24h, don't understand why both of your remotes behaving like that.

Ok it’s been a few days since my last charge. Haven’t done a massive ride, but I reckon I’ve done at least 20km/one hour of riding. Here’s my remote battery indicator.

As for board battery indicator- I’m getting three bars of board battery voltage at 40.6 volts. Basically only getting 4 bars for the first 5 mins of riding.

Got my replacement batteries and they fit perfectly! If anyone wants an easy 30% capacity upgrade, you can get these cells.

![image|666x500](upload://7WLvwzfUTS9OMlDcIqZdv4xpecb.jpeg)

You can also finding higher capacities (850 was the highest i was able to find, linked above) within the size dimensions (max 45 x 25 x 10 mm)

My only tip when replacing the pouch is that you carefully take off the old cell so you can use the same pad and adhesive. Otherwise double sided tape works as well. Also, my PPM wire came off the throttle at the lightest touch, but it was a 2 second solder job to put it back on, wish they used a thicker gauge for those wires.

EDIT: Just finished charging and the new pouch charges to 4.13v. I guess it's safe to say it's the charging circuit of on these remotes that's inconsistent...

Great find! The original battery capacity isn't too bad but also not impressive and the ppm jst connector and wires are not of the highest quality, experienced it too.\
Yesterday my remote didn't connect on the first startup had to power down the board and switch it on again, hope that's just a one time issue.

The extra blue wire is to go between the positive terminal of the battery and the V connection on the receiver. 

**BUT** only if you’re using PPM connection. If you’re using any of the UART variants the voltage wire is the white which that is not connected to the vesc JST connector.

Wherever you connect the voltage wire, it’s probably a good idea to solder this and insulate the connection. Also, if you do use the single blue wire for voltage, glue or tape the connection to the V pin on the receiver. Otherwise it will vibrate free of the pin and you’ll have a live high voltage wire bouncing around in your enclosure.

Hi all!

Receive my vx1 a few days ago.
My setup - two vesc 6 from flipsky. To first vesc via uart connected bluetooth module for read info from PC or phone via bluetooth. To second vesc i connect vx1 receiver via UART.
Two vescs connected via can bus.
All works fine.
But I have some issues.

1. When i use max throttle it only speed's up to 95%. (Is there any way to calibrate it, note that i use UART).
2. Strange failsage. When i turn on board. It applies current brake (that i setup in configuration tool). 
After when i turn on remote it works OK. When i turn off remote, vesc did not apply current brake. Ho to properly setup failsafe?

Might be a dumb question but if you run the Flipsky remote with a FOCBOX unity in PPM mode can you activate reverse through the Unity app? 

Is UART for the reverse button or the actual function of reverse?

You don't need anything other that the feature turned in in the config, it's not remote or UART dependant.

You can use the "current" control mode to have forward be forward and backward to be reverse like boosted. See below

PPM Current Control:
* positive throttle propels board forward
* negative throttle will propel the board backward
* reverse button does nothing

PPM Current no reverse w/brake:
* positive throttle propels board forward
* negative throttle brakes
* reverse button does nothing

UART:
* Just like "Current no reverse with brake" except...
* button will reverse the direction that positive throttle propels the board.

Keep in mind UART has limited configuration so you cannot adjust the following
* minimum signal
* maximum signal
* center signal
```

Well it works great in PPM and you get all the features minus the reverse button. I guess there's just no great way to have both worlds. I'm not sure how PPM + Uart mode would behave on the VESC if you tried that though. You could try that out, just hook it up like normal UART and have the 'S' (signal) pin connected to the PPM signal pin.

I really wish I’d taken the opportunity to play around with UART so I could answer the questions people are asking.

But ultimately I was always gonna end up using PPM. I don’t know, it just seems way more robust to me. And I don’t understand why people care about reverse. Especially when you have to to that convoluted sequence with the flipsky remote to get it to go in reverse.

As for adjusting settings in UART... can anyone confirm the throttle min/max/centre vesc settings actually don’t work with UART? I got the impression based on something I read that you could... maybe something like the PPM signal is still sent with UART wiring?

There are not working with UART. Cause UART is digital (PMM kinda analog). I can not adjust min/max. Buy default receiver send 95% on full throttle, and -100-99% on full brake. Zero is zero.

I setup with only 1 vesc connected to UART. And second vesc operated by CAN-bus. Traction control also works perfectly.
Also you can adjuct expo settings. It works to.

In conclusion there two disadvantage in this method:
1. 95% full throttle (but it can adjusted in motor settings).
2. No fail-safe. (Did not know will it be in PMM mode. It looks like there are no fail-safe at all).

In section Motor settings -> General -> Current -> Max current scale. But you should do it with care. It can be dangerous for motors.

The best way, and the one I think flipsky use is to use the SetChuckData via UART, this way you don’t have to program the motor currents, CAN forward and everything on your external device and leave all to the VESC

You can also do the hard way and implement everything by yourself, but it makes no sense for a comercial product

Every time I try to set up the remote, like I would with the older Nano remote, it does populate the values when I give it throttle or brake. It just powers the motors.

Idk what I’m doing wrong here. Do I need to calibrate the remote as in set the pulse values?

I got this remote, it is really cool! I started with it hooked up in UART so I could have reverse but I had some problems getting it to control both of my VESC over CAN-BUS since the other one has a bluetooth on it's UART... So now using PPM.

Don't really care about reverse that much actually, I mostly got it for the nice thumb wheel style and the battery meter. I didn't expect the quality to be so good! It has a soft touch rubber on the surface and the thumbwheel is very smooth.

I've only had one problem with a disconnect and that was just it didn't pair the first time, I had to turn it off and on again.

It's kind of expensive and I personally wish it had a finger hole, but overall this remote is great!

It depends how you want to use the remote, UART or PPM, usually V4, but judging from the pictures you might get only UART connectors with it. I was in the preorders and got all connectors. And use it with PPM. With PPM you loose only the reverse function. If you are fine with PPM then choose PPM. Or ask them to include PPM connector with your V4 order.

Just pick vesc 4 dual to give you the most options in cabling. If you're using ppm you literally won't be using any of the included cables you might as well get them. The only difference between the versions are the cables that are included (ppm has no cables included)

I was still investigating some stuff about this remote,...

The chipset is an PAN163CX, this is just a simple 32bit controller with build-in 2,4Ghz tranceiver.

There is not much know about this chipset other than that is is also used by the Chinese micro drones (EACHINE E016H)
https://github.com/goebish/nrf24_multipro/issues/46 
(here is datasheet in dutch (translated from chinese i guess))
but hacking this controller is a nogo I think.

further more, 
- The throttle wheel is just a resistive 1d joystick
- there is a 500mAh 3,7v lipo
- vibrator with mosfet
- Buck-boost driver and a simple charge circuit.

I'll go probing the blank pads when I get home :stuck_out_tongue: try to find out what protocol they are using

So far I'm happy with the remote, good throttle feel and response, connected it to one VESC via UART only and the other VESC is connected via CAN. It was plug and play (used a solidGeek remote before but had a lot of disconnects) so didn't have to change anything on my VESC

I was hoping this was just a redesigned meepo remote because of the similar style, and could help make the cheap meepo remotes work on DIY somehow with a custom receiver.

I think that would be cool, make a receiver for the meepo remote would basically be same as this but cheaper... (Actually, no vibration on meepo (but it looks like it could be added?) and this flipsky has a nice rubberized finish to it)

Actually it seems very similar, the bottom shape is exactly the same. The placement of the internal reinforcement for where the screws go is the same. Even the spot where the unpopulated pair button is in the same location.

I thought maybe this is the same factory that makes the MEEPO remote was doing an OEM design for flipsky. But actually too much is different, and the quality seems better. I think flipsky took a MEEPO remote and just copied as much as they could from the design for the case so they don't need to be creative on it.

The innovation from both the DIY and the chinese manufacturers is fascinating to me because this is a fast growing but still small industry.

Although right now it lasts a little bit longer than a full charge on my board, so as long as I remember to top them off at the same time, it's not a big deal.

This remote is good. I don't know how anyone can use a trigger style remote.

Remember the cruise controll is not speed controll, its power controll, so it will keep accelerating. It just lock the amount of power you are using with the throttle.

But i find the controller alot better then nano. I installed 850 mAh in them.

Those are "shortcomings" i'm willing to take. The battery well yes that sucks but luckily is easily swapped.

EDIT : The other thing : if i plug it into the UART port i won't be able to use a bluetooth module unless i get a splitter which is not the best idea.
So i rather use the standard PPM port for the remote, uart for the module amd the only thing i'm missing is reverse (which i don't need) correct?

This might be a dumb question, is the stock battery in the vx1 a lipo? Or li-ion? From what I know lipo packs are not as stable as li-ion. If we are all swapping in these lipo packs, are we going to run into a problem where these will start puffing on us? Or is this pack to small to do that? Or maybe there is just not enough current draw to puff pack these? Again I know might be a stupid question, but I'm wanting to upgrade the battery in my remotes and this is something that is on my mind.

That's not part of the remote's function but now the VESC tool had come up with a new FW that supports braking+reverse like the @Ackmaniac version of VESC tool :+1:

When you're  riding forward, pulling the remote thumb wheel will brake until the board to a stop, then you let go of the thumb wheel and pull again for reverse :slight_smile:

Haha I used to do that most of the time too, 1 feet on the ground and another on the board :+1:

But I still appreciate the reverse function nevertheless :slight_smile:

@Jinra, using Focbox unity stock firmware (latest AFAIK) I am not seeing any of these options. What do I have to do ? I'm using FOCBOX tool on Windows. I've tried to connect to the box using VESC Tool but got errors on inappropriate firmware etc ....

I guess the focbox tool just doesnt have it, it's probably stuck on default of 4k.

Yes, but it's not just the tool itself, Ackmaniac requires to update or in this case downgrade the firmware in order to "speak" with the Focbox, and I haven't studied yet if this is ok for the Focbox or not.

You should only use unity f/w for the unity

Ok, so back to that, does the stock unity with it's firmware acts with the tips you mentioned earlier ? Otherwise according to you, I should not replace the firmware to something that is not enertion's.

You should not use non-enertion firmware, but the enertion focbox tool doesn't seem to have the option to adjust reverse eRPM, so it's probably at the stock 4k value.

Happened again. Most of the video is useless but the few notable points are.

* :05 I stop at the intersection
* 1:00 light turns green
* 1:01 camera tilts down because I thought board was going to accelerate, but I saw the remote lost connection
* 1:03-1:11 I kick over to the side and restart the remote and it reconnects and i can accelerate again.

I've experienced the same thing on one of the busiest intersection in my city as well but the disconnection lasted only 2 seconds and I didn't have to reboot the remote, did you notice is the connection LED blinking on the remote?

Is the consensus to get the Vesc 6 model for the Focbox Unity so I can use the cable if need be in the future?

On the VX1? 
Its the vesc 4.xx not 6, the unity has its uart port in the 4.xx order because its a 4.xx board.

If you have unity, wait a bit. Flipsky is working on a unity version. The current one is not compatible.

These guys just _barely_ fit, but they _do_ fit. Been working great for me for a few cycles, huge improvement in up time.

Hi everybody! I made an account just to let everybody know that **Filipsky upgraded the battery by default to 850mAh.**

I saw that a lot of people (including the Bioboards guy) upgraded their remotes to bigger battery. When I bought the remote from filipsky store last month on aliexpress and got 850mAh battery inside :slight_smile: will add a photo when the forum will "upgrade" my profile  :D
