Hey guys I need some help configuring my vesc. My parts are 6374 190kv @Jlabs motor, two 3s 30c 5000 mah lipos in series and a torque boards vesc. What settings do I change to optimize my build?

Would you like me to set this up for you over TeamViewer in maybe 4 hours time?  I've helped a few people by taking control of their computer for a few minutes and talk you through it over Skype. Pm me if you want to do this

Edit: I've had a few people pm me about doing this for them. If you need help don't be shy, I'm happy to give back to the community where I can
