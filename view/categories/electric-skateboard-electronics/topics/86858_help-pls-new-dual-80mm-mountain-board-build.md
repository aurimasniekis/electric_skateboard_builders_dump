Hi all I have set up my motors with the latest vesc tool, it was very simple so that was nice, the only thing is that one motor seems to be a lot faster (higher rpm) than the other?? Also they don’t seem to be very well synchronised with each other?? One motor has thicker cables coming from it, which makes me think maybe they have different kv ratings?? I have attach the Foc pictures from the motors from the vesc set up?

Could any1 please help with this? 

Many thanks Ben 
Ps, this is my first build so I’m not to good with electronics?
