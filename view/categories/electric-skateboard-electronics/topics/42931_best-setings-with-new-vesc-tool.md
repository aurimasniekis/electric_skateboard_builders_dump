For one week ago i noticed there is a new vesc tool avaible so i decided to download it.
I updated firmware as the tool said to latest, rebooted, and used the wizards to get the setup done.

I decided to test my board outside and it was huge different to ride than before ...
It was much better before than after those changes ....  shouldnt it be better ?

I also noticed that my brake strengh is much lower than before (same values as before)
I also changed my remote from winning to this one

Might it has something todo with it ?

My specs

Motor : 80 amp 200kv 3,3 kw
Battery : 10s4p Samsung 30 Q
Bms : Bestech HCX-D223v1 80A
Vesc 4.12 (latest firmware)

What would be the best settings for me ?

Settings are close to perfect as far as I am concerned. Others have reported different braking behaviour when using FOC compared to the old tool and have switched to bldc. Far from ideal. 

Trampa hasn't provided an answer as to why the braking performance is worse. 

Perhaps akmaniaks version does a better job.

Other way around for me. There appears to be a mystery factor.

Have the same problem with brakes, the board is not fully braked then I hit -100% at PPM and it makes me nuts cause I have to stand on some hill to open gates and it always rolls back :D
