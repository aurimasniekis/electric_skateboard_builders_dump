In this case, does this mean I have to connect the balance lead wires in parallel first then connect them to the BMS?

** What app/software do you guys use to make those beautiful wiring diagrams? **

Thanks!

I use pages out of a squared notebook because it helps with my straight lines.  And i keep a red and black pen at hand. Free version downloadable from the official site

You can use Paint(you should not) or Inkscape(you should, I do) to make nice vector graphics

So I can use something like this on each parallel connection

or

Then connect them in series to the BMS.

Yes, use a series connector or if you're comfortable with soldering you can go that route.

I'm thinking of doing the same thing did you ever try this method?
