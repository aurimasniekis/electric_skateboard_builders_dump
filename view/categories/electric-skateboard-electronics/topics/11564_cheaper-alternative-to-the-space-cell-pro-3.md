Does anyone know of an alternative to the space cell pro 3 but quite a bit cheaper?

Thanks,
Cal

@CalinStalin The SPACE Cell is a pretty good deal. There are other vendors that make similar products, but they are priced about the same.

You can ask @barajabali to make you a pack, but keep in mind a nice li-ion pack will cost a pretty penny.

Yeah. For a quality pack you're looking at some $. Even building it yourself requires a decent amount (talking from experience).

LiPo + some kind of encloser

I know this is off topic, but are spring trucks required for all terrain builds or will they work fine with a skate truck?

You should really use the spring trucks.
