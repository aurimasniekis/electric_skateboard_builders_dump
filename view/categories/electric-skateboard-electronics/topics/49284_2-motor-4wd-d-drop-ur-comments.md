Wheels not beeing able to spin independently? Going to be some hard turns...

[/quote]

There are thooth bearing which are only spin in one direction... 
Maybe the use of them,  so the wheels could spin free if u dont speed up,  could help
At least on the front side... 
We need the back for breaking somehow :smile:

Nice idea but nah the one-way bearing won't work by itself, you need a LSD of some sort if you don't wanna get locked speed for all wheels. 

Keep it up !

As @Vanarian said... A one way bearing won't work unless it's on both side... But then that means no brakes. A single one way will require a differential, maybe a clutch type slip diff...

Double one way bearing on a front truck, with a standard setup in the back will give you extra acceleration power... But retain braking ability in the rear...

I was hoping this were about 4WD with controller per side. But yea, i'm interested how much it would be more difficult to steen with this.

Missed the second post. Only saw the first with a possibille front and back setup

Another side note.. one way beaings will only ever be powering one wheel unless you are going straight.

A differential will split the power between the wheels at all times proportionally

Any design for this would need to produce a better result than using 4 motors.  What about this would be better?

I think the reason (non-electric) cars and whatnot use differentials is because they can't use two motors...and those that can (electric ones) I don't think use differentials.

To me, this seems like moving backwards

just the fact that u have to pay 2 esc and 2 motors for lets say 400 bucks
if u do this all WD and with singel motors you need to pay 4 each so 800 bucks

I would say cost..

3 motor setup would be cheaper then 4 ..

Aluminum for mounting could be pennies compared to a 4th motor.

Seem 2 motor scenario is not practical for this application.. but idk...

It's probably a viable option for 3 motor drive to cut some costs over going full 4wd...

That's legit.

What performance benefits would the extra drive-only wheels have though for the extra weight you need over a dual-diagonal or both-rear-wheels drive?

what do u mean with drive only ?

as far as we went here i like to say, this is a 2,5WD with 2 motors ..
so u can drive straight with 4 wheels powered and hard turns with 2 WD on the outer wheels, which is acually supporting the turn if i calculate that physically correct.
___
and if u mean the difference between 2 motors 2 wheels in the back
than i could imagine if u get wheelspin on the back tires (maybe a spot with sand or other slippy stuff
the front drive-train could pull u out ^^

 im just trying to figure out if this concept is **possible** ... ^^

year .. for teeth reasons the back wheels may need to be fixed..
so u can drive 2WD up to 4WD and still break with all wheels on the back truck

I think @PXSS did the math once for the turning radius and found out it should not be too big of a deal with the small distance the wheels are apart on a skateboard. Why nobody ever went all the way and tried it I don't know.

Just put pulleys and motor mounts on a back truck -- except instead of motors, put an axle through the motor holes.  Just to try it out and see how much it bites while turning.  Put actual motors on the front truck while testing ;-)

It's enough to cause shimmying and induce a wobble. Will increase the faster you go... And I'm not sure about you but the faster I go the harder I push into a carve as I don't like staying centered...always leaning one way or the other keeps wobbles from happening...

It's not a setup for high speed carving sure - but everyone always bashes the idea so nobody dares to try it. How we went 2 years plus without anyone actually publishing some test results is beyond me. People have done way crazier things on this forum.

I'd like someone to come up and say: I tried it, works up to 20km/h and sucks above that. Then we at least know and everybody could decide for themselves if 20km/h would be enough of a top speed for them but have a 4WD setup.

You don't even need motors to test it... Just install one way bearings in some wheels with a key. It will be unpleasant.

Actually, its the inner wheels getting the power so any throttle you give will likely straighten out your turn.

And i have a single rear wheel drive, the sideways force it can throw at you from full throttle/brake almost hade me keel over several times. So i imagine that stiff axles would be that times four and the one way bearing 4wd that times two but with the added fun that the driven side can change any time! Would be an interesting ride indeed...

Though if you set sensible power levels on each motor and stayed of full gas in tight turns, it'd probably work out quite nice. But you might have to give up the brakes

@Maxid @Deckoz
I knew a guy from school that tried it and it worked. I have not seen him in mire than a year but I know his 1 motor "dual" worked fine.

To me it looks pretty sick idea as long as your motors and ratio can take the load.

I want to see what you'll come up with!
