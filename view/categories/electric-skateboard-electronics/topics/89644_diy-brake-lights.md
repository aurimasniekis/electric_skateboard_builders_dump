Basically I didn't want to buy some shred lights and did't particularly like the look of them so I decided to make my own. Now my design won't probably be as bright as shred lights but it did only cost around 10$ to make with the filament. This is still a work in progress future upgrades will include water resistance and maybe a flashing pattern. Here is the thingiverse link for the [stl](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3546091) files.
