I live in the us and i plan on using this vesc diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/ and two of these batteries hooked in series. https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-high-capacity-3s-5200mah-multi-rotor-lipo-pack.html

If you go for a single drive everybody recommends a higher voltage and lower kv, so maybe use two 5s batteries in series in order to get 10s, which is perfect for a 190kv. In US I think @JLabs sells some with 4mm bullet, sensored as well. He may be running a group buy at the moment, check him out

Kv is too high, with 6s it will have a decent speed but horrible torque, while on 10s it will hit the rpm limit on the vesc. Sk3s are known to be good reliable motors, but I don't think they fit your needs, you may find something better, like torqueboards or jlabs. Sensored mode is also a good thing, since it allows a smooth start from still. Oh, and multistars are not good batteries, try to find turnigys

I am taking a pre-order right now for them, 2.5 weeks and they will ship. Here is the link for more info http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/6374-stealth-motor-group-buy-pre-order/12604/13?u=jlabs
They are reliable, affordable, and sound like they will fit your needs.

Wich motor should I take for a 12V 9Ah battery
I am a lightweigt person and am not planning to ride any uphill as I live in a very flat area.
Would any of these two work for me?

 - 280kv 1500w
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-5055-280kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

Or 

 - 270kv 2400w
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/ntm-prop-drive-50-60-270kv-2400w.html

If you have any other idea, everything is welcome.

Hmm 12V is a bit on the low side, is there a specific reason you want this kind of battery? @koen1020

No not any specific reason, I could buy a second battery to make 24V 6Ah.
Do you think I need 24Volts?

My setup is based on cheap, but still fast. I'm guessing this is also your goal.
I've bought a 260 kV motor ( altough I would recommend a 245 kV for better torque and larger size stator).
I paired this with  2* 3s battery in series giving me a 6s 5000mAh battery. A 6s battery is easier to charge using a cheap balance charger. 
Also very important, dont cheap out on your ESC, buy a VESC.
