I just finished building my very first electric longboard. But, when i went to program my esc using the usb link it wouldn't read the esc settings, and when i tried sending settings to the esc it wouldn't change anything.

```
open the program on your pc

insert usb cable -> "USB DEVICE" should go green

make sure your esc has battery connected and motor (not turned on yet)
Connect your usb cable to your ESC 

Turn on your esc by connecting battery/loopkey/on off switch

both buttons should be Green now

If this didn't work , you maybe need an extra Serial Usb program. But i'm not sure. It's in the download links at alienpowersystem.com

That is strange. You are using the correct program for your esc? 

Well mine reads it automatically when I connect with my pc
