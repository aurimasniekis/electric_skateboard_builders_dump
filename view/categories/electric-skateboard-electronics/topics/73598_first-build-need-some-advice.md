Are these parts compatible with each other? I there something I forgot to include?

Any help or advice would be appreciated.

Thanks!

A 5065 motor with a 6s battery is not going to have a lot of power. Your range with that battery is going to be about 3 miles, and top speed maybe 18mph. I would recommend doing some more research, and buying quality parts. All of your parts will work for a while, but buy cheap buy twice. Check this site out, they sell quality parts and pretty much everything you need to build your board:
