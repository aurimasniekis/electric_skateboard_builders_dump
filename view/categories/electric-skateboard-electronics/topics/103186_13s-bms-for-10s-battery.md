Hi everyone! I am building my first esk8 and I decided to build my own battery pack. At first I wanted to build a 13s battery, but only after buying the 13s BMS I decided to build a 10s battery.
The BMS that I bought is the Daly 13s 60A:

I know this question has been asked before, but answers to it are never clear as people tend to disagree. So here is the question: can I use this BMS for a 10s battery? If so, what should I do with the last 3 wires? Simply not use them?

Thanks to everyone in advance!

No, you, can't. There are some bms which can accept few S counts (there is always scheme which wires you should short), but this is not one of them. Try to sell it on forum and get yourself 10s bms.
