I have Dual Focbox never used before. 
Received notification that firmware needs updated in vesc tool
Try to do a firmware update and the green signal light goes out and focbox disconnects. 
Restart focbox and lights up fine but green light goes away if I try to update and it disconnects.
Process with the other motor went fine. 

Any ideas on where I go from here?

calling @CarlCollins directly is probably a faster route then @EnertionSupport, even though theyre probably one and the same :thinking:
