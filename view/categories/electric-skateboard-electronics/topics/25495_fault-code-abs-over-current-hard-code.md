As soon as I turn on the board this code is present, can't get rid of it. 

Has anyone got it before? How did you fix it? 

Board works perfectly

The vesc works but you get this fault code???

Usually when this fault code is constant, there's a fet that is blown and the vesc would not run at all

Or a cold solder on the shunts would cause this also

Yes, board works perfect. We'll at least on the bench I'll try it on the road right now. 

Where are the shunts? Can I visually inspect then  now?

Did you find the problem?
I have the same fault on one of my vescs.
Only if powering on. Motor running fine.
Motor detection also.

I think the issue was a bad connection on the VESC caps legs, thet were broken.
