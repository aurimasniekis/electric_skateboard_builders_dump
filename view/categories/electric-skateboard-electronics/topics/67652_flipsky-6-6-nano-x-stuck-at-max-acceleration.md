Hi all,

Today I was on my way to work, and my board throw me off because suddenly it accelerated at full throttle for no reasons. 

Iâ€™m ok Foc, sensorless, hub motors set at 60a / -45a / 30a / -15a on a Sanyo 10s2p. 

At 11.13 when I got the issue: https://metr.at/r/CiIhf

I tested the failsafe and seems working so I donâ€™t think can be a disconnection. 

Any ideas? Thanks so much
```

Hey you're in SF! So am I! Looks like you were riding through FiDi. I wouldn't rule out heavy interference in that area even if there was no disconnection. Otherwise I would look at your receiver's connection. Make sure it's solid and glued down!

Awe!!!! I got interferences before but usually was a drop not an acceleration. 

I might need to add that that happened right after a long downhill. 

Thanks so much!!!

Plugged the mini remote and so far seems much better in every way. Iâ€™ll check tomorrow in downtown and see how it goes. Hopefully Iâ€™ll not crash like I did today ðŸ˜‚
