### Full disclosure:
I've spent a lot of time and energy designing and implementing the apps including the web part. I've thought carefully about the business model and how to make the apps future-proofüí∞. I decided to make the apps free and earn money by selling the bluetooth modules. Thats why I've built some protection that only allows apps to work with my modules. Other modules most likely won't work. This also helps me to provide best user experience and ease of use. The modules I sell are no soldering required‚Ñ¢ pre-configured¬© plug and play¬Æ solution.

You can buy bluetooth modules here https://metr.at/shop
The price of the module is $23.95 üíµ üíµ
Priority shipping with tracking to all destinations is $10 üíµ
Modules are shipped from Stockholm, Sweden üá∏üá™

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

I will try to provide best customer service and user experience for my apps. I have a lot of ideas but I will focus on the things the community needs first. Please let me know which new features would you like to see.

Feature request: Simple Android Wear integration.  I'd like to see my speed and juice stats on an Android Wear watch face, similar to Strava but with power information as well.  

I may or may not strap that watch face to my mini remote in place of the non-functional trackwheel. :wink:

I will not opensource this project at least for now. Because if I do @lox897 will most likely buy HM10 or HM05 on ebay.

@lox897 Didn't mean to steal your app and use it with a cheaper module. I already have a HM-10 for Jacob's app and a HC-05 for solarturtle on android. But if there is protection, then that kind of goes against the open-source DIY community. I was going to donate, but it doesn't matter.

Thank you, but my business model is not based on donations. You are welcome to buy a module and enjoy all features of my apps. Not every product in this community is open-source. And being open-source does not make any product awesome out of the box. Look at Jacob's app. It doesn't even work.

This guy made a kickass app and deserves compensation. If you want it fork over the very fair 20 dollars. It's his choice to open source it or not, people don't do things for free.

From one programmer to another, I applaud your work this is extremely clean. I also vote for an android watch interface, I'll be buying one of these as soon as the new vescs come out, please stick around until then!!!!

[/quote]

This forum is built on opensourceness. We share, and build together, learning from each others mistakes, and sharing our work. The vesc is especially opensource. I'm not sure, but you may be require by law to disclose the source, since you have to utilize and interact with the vesc code. Even if you have one line of the vescs code in your app, you are legally required to release the source code, due to the licensing of the vesc.

@rpasichnyk I've been in this market for tha last month and a half, and I realized, there just isn't a lot of money here. You can keep it closed, but you won't necessarily make more than if you opensourced it. As it is, your making something like $10 per module (which is the same markup I have on mine). So far, I've made more off of donations than through the module sales, and I expect it will be that way moving forward. There's a lot of programmers on this forum that would like to add their own features, that are happy to donate money for your time. Some already have the correct module, and don't need another module. Those people may be willing to donate way more than $10.

It's your choice to do what you want, but if profit is your first priority, I've learned that this community doesn't particularly support that model. We are a more opensource community, and I can't believe the generosity of those who donate to open source projects on here.

Because he made this and said that's not what he wants to do, that's why.

@evoheyax go look at  https://github.com/vedderb/bldc the software has no license stated, only the hardware is licensed under the creative commons. He isnt required to do anything. AND even if it was under the cc license he would only be required to release the modified vesc firmware not the source to his app or the Bluetooth hardware schematic.

I am very careful when it comes to licensing. I did not use Benjamin's code because it's GPL. I build on top of the platform. VESC command protocol is open. Think about it like writing apps for Android. Android is open-source but it doesn't mean all apps that run on Android should be open-source.

VESC is the future. Everyone's buying VESC. China joined the party. VESC-X comes out. VESC 6 is coming (hopefully) soon. The market is big already and people need apps.

This is true. I'm working on a video overlay feature right now, as you've given me no choice but to punch the the gas pedal to to the floor, haha.

I have been on the fence about using gps data. It can sometimes be inaccurate, especially gps speed data. This is why I calculate speed data based on the vesc erpm instead of using GPS data. I was planning to eventually incorporate some kind of gps data mapping, but you did a very good job with it, so I'm speechless there as where to head in that dirrection.

One other thing. You have an current data point, but is that battery or motor? Both can be very important.

[quote="rpasichnyk, post:18, topic:13483"]

It's true. My point is that a lot of people won't want or use bluetooth modules. A lot of the community is about the necessities and bluetooth is a luxury. @hummie for example has had my module for over a month and hasn't really used it much at all. Even as much as I love it, I find my self not using it way more than I do. I think theres a lot that will buy them, but I think the number will be less than n25% of those who buy vescs.

Oh, and another question, do you get data from multiple vescs or only from one? There's a command in the vesc command file for getting data from slave vescs.

@evoheyax It is a battery current that you see on the chart. Motor current can be seen in the Realtime Tab. I get the data from one VESC. Multiple will come later. I agree with you 25% is a very big number.

Unfortunately, Samsung Gears are running Tizen OS not Android Wear. TBH, I don't know how difficult a task it is to port to tizen, but I do know that android wear has a TON more apps developed for it- likely developers spend the time/effort where they will hit the biggest market, can't blame them for that.

Wow. Definitely the best looking/ most powerful App so far. And it looks like it hasn't a lot of bugs like Jacobs app or the little bugs in @evoheyax app.
To have the opportunity to change the layout directly in the app is amazing. 
Just a little thing I noticed and I would do different is the font representation. Your size of the text adjusts dynamically to the current value. So the XX.1 is shorter than the XX.3 so it adjusts its position. Also the XX.0 isn't represented as a "XX.0 ", its represented as a "XX". I would set it constant to 1 digit after decimal point. So then the text wouldnt change its position and size, resulting in a much smother look. I hope that you understand what I mean.

The other thing I noticed is the constraint to have internet connection and upload my record data to your server to have the possibility to view it as a graph. I know it is great if you want to share your ride and have internet available and the result looks very sick :sunglasses:, but isn't it possible to also have the opportunity to look the data offline? So plotting the graph inside the app? That would be amazing.

It depends what graphing library he's using. They may or may not have a mobile version, and even if they have a mobile version, it may not be for both android and iOS. I can do in app graphing because I use a library called coreplot. It has versions for other languages too, so when I build my server side graphs in the near future, I can easily pass the data and rebuild the graphs quite easily.

Nice to see this on your TODO list. I think a first step in the right direction would be to have the opportunity to look the data in table form or just the max and min values, because right now you cant see anything of your recorded ride then the used Energy and the distance. (the max speed, average speed, max temp etc. would be cool to have also) Maybe also save the data in a .csv file or anything like that which then can be send over email or viewed on other mobile app. Lets say your server shuts down because of a reason then we cant do anything with our data.

Is changing the VESC settings with perimetr app possible if I use dual motors? I have to connect the Bluetooth module with only one VESC, so how can I change the Motor Configuration on the other VESC? Or do I need two modules? Or can I connect both VESCs with one module and switch between the VESCs? Or I mount two plugs in the enclosure and lay the module to the outside so I can plug the module to one and after configuration I plug it to the other one?

@yaca You only need one bluetooth module. Upcoming update will allow communicating via CAN bus. You just need to configure your VESCs like [this](http://www.lp-electronic.com/vesc/connect-two-vesc-via-can-bus/) (you probably already have done it)

### Here's a preview:

After establishing bluetooth connection **perimetr** will automatically figure out how much VESCs you have in total:

After that you can select the VESC that you want and do read / write / save. Another feature coming up is:

### BLDC motor detection

Just a thought: shouldn't motor detection only be done with motors that have no load (so also no belt attached). Your system makes it easy to mess that up when you don't even have to attach the USB cable and can do it on the fly.

We'd have to ask Vedder for that. When it comes to my precious VESC though, I do not want to risk it. If Vedder says I should do it without belt I will definitely only do it without belt. Chances of doing something harmful to the VESC that I don't even know about are just too high. Sticking to the "official" instructions is the only way I can at least feel a little safer.

@Rampano You only need one bluetooth module

@Maxid Yes, it is totally safe to run detection with belt. Belt by itself does not put that much load. Please watch this video carefully. Benjamin shows how to do FOC motor detection and he does that with the belt.

Discovering this thread was like an emotion lift.
First, I was so excited to see how powerful and user friendly is this app.
Emotion : :grinning: :grinning: :grinning:

Then, I learned the app is closed and work only with dedicated hardware we have to buy on your website.
Emotion : :frowning: :disappointed_relieved: :disappointed_relieved:

I have some HC05 and HM10 already on my boards.
So, I won't order another one just for having it compatible with your app.
So, I won't use and enjoy your app.
So, I won't give you any cent although I always make donations for guys like you who deserve it for their amazing job.
So, finally, we both loose.

Like @evoheyax, I think it's a shame that we couldn't work together in an opensource way.
This is thousand times more powerful and everybody wins.

It's not for bashing, just my 2 cents for trying to demonstrate the limit of this system (and I can't blame you, we are all shaped in this capitalism system since our birth). ;)

Anyway, your app seems to be a piece of art so congratulations for your talent and work !
I hope one day I could be able to create my own app.

@rpasichnyk I received my modul but it doesn't fit with the 7-pins connector. When I ordered I choosed V4.8 and newer because I have a VESC 4.12 from Enertion, but this has a 6-pin connector. I didn't count the pins on the VESC, because I thought it's enough to know I have a VESC 4.12 and this is newer then 4.8.
What can I do now? Should I cut a part of the plug next to the green wire?

@yaca No, do not cut the plug. You are looking at the wrong connector. You need to use UART, please look at this picture:

## UART:
### ADC2 -- RX -- TX -- ADC -- GND -- 3.3V -- 5V

Recently I figured out that VESCs from Enertion do not have UART housing connectors. That's unfortunate.

@raxell If you have 1 VESC, it is not possible. If you have 2 VESCs, you can connect my module to the slave VESC and Nunchuck to the master VESC and it will work

@Esrapp21 I tried to make it "plug and play" as much as possible, but just in case I will post detailed instructions:

1. Check that you have UART connector on your VESC. UART pins are ADC2 - RX - TX - ADC - GND - 3.3V - 5V. VESCs from Enertion do not have it. In this case you will have to solder the connector (included with the package)
2. Use the official BLDC tool, go to App Configuration, click "Read Configuration", switch to UART+PPM or UART+ADC (if you use ADC and know what it is). Make sure Baud Rate is 115200. If you have more than 1 VESC and want to use Nunchuck, connect the bluetooth module to any of the slave VESCs and switch to UART on that particular slave VESC.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/7/97e2ccf8d2d147b5a9e7a0ef9a65056e35d3de38.png" width="400" >
Don't forget to "Write configuration"
3. Turn off the VESC 
4. Plug the module in and power on the VESC
5. Run metr app, go to Settings tab and click Scan. Connect to your module
6. Make sure you can see the Voltage and Temperature and other things and that they look correct

If you only want to use [metr](https://metr.at) app you are good to go. If you also want to use [perimetr](https://metr.at/perimetr) app to modify VESC settings on the go, you need to use my firmware.

1. Download [the firmware](https://metr.at/firmware), make sure you download the right version corresponding to your VESC (most likely VESC_4_10_plus.bin)
2. Use BLDC tool to flash the firmware
3. Open perimetr, go to Settings Tab and click Scan. Connect to the module, and click Read.
4. When Read finishes, try clicking Write.
5. If both Read and Write work without errors, you've done everything right!

If you notice any problems please report them here.

It is pretty obvious that you are using a HM10. They are one of the only ones that work with iOS and Android. And your picture looks exactly like one. I also love the effort you have put into to keep this closed source, your code and all. And how (I think) it looks for a specific UUID for the bt module , maybe even name... Really weird how you say that the default vesc baud rate is 115200. The HM10s default is 9600. I still think you would make a ton more money if you charged everyone who downloads it $1-5 and let them use any ble module. That is just my opinion though...

When you flash the official VESC firmware the default baud is 115200. You can change that to 9600 over the BLDC tool. But because @rpasichnyk have programmed his HM10 modules to the 115200 baud you don't need to change that.

I don't really like the idea of making discounts. It would not be fair to people who have already bought a product. In fact I am planning to **slightly** increase the price at some point next year. The apps will have a little bit more features and some feedback (hopefully good) and it will be less risk for new people who still hesitate. Consider there is a discount right now  üéÖ :evergreen_tree:

I am using posten.se (regular post) for shipping. Don't know why but the lowest price for priority shipping with tracking to all countries (except Sweden) is the same. Without tracking the price is lower, but I don't have time to deal with slow and undelivered mail. The best way to save on shipping is to do a group buy with your neighbors.

I have tested my module today. You can see a log here: https://metr.at/r/HPKTs

Some things that I have noticed:

-the GPS speed is not working for me on iOS (haven't tested Android yet) GPS was turned on (and the GPS inside a running App worked finde), but no GPS speed in the metr app. I also used the setting "Prefer GPS", but because it was not working there is now also no RPM-calculated speed in the graph. In the uploaded data the max speed is shown as 24kmh. Don't know where this data came from, because GPS shows "0 kmh" and I have set to use GPS speed over RPM speed.
-When changing the "Motor Poles", "Wheel diameter" or any setting where the keyboard pops up, there is no button to close it. On Android there is a button for closing it. Also touching on the "background" of the keyboard doesn't close it.
-When pushing the app into the background it crashed. When I switched between metr and runtastic app the recording of the metr app stopped and was not saved. So the data was lost. The app running with the device locked was working as it should.
-Would be nice to also have the "Motor Current" in the graph. Just the "Battery Current" is showed now, but it is not labeled as "battery current", just "current".
-the sampling rate with 2Hz is quite low. Haven't tested to lower the "update interval" because its says it can cause communication problems. What is the bottleneck? I know from a bluetooth gimbal app, that there a update rate of 30Hz was possible.

Hope you can use this feedback to make the app even better. :slight_smile: Thanks.

I remember during early stages in testing when I went above 10Hz I had problems around 2 minutes after establishing the connection. 2Hz is really safe, but you can experiment and increase the rate. I was planning to change the algorithm and instead of time intervals just send new request right after previous response comes, resulting in maximum exchange rate.

Thank you for the constructive feedback!

I remember during early stages in testing when I went above 10Hz I had problems around 2 minutes after establishing the connection. 2Hz is really safe, but you can experiment and increase the rate. I was planning to change the algorithm and instead of time intervals just send new request right after previous response comes, resulting in maximum exchange rate.

Ok. I will test to increase it then. Thanks for your continuous work.[quote="laurnts, post:96, topic:13483"]

By the way. Here you can see a interesting graph. https://metr.at/r/EKA4T
The motor poles where set wrong there, so the speed isn't correct. I was driving there over a street bump and my Vedder Antisparkswitch gets turned off, because I toggled the switch accidentally. In my opinion the energy generated by the motor driving my bike normally generates a voltage of 6-11V in the VESC, so that the bluetooth connection stayed alive. 
I don't know why the metr app shows a negative distance and energy value, because regenerative breaking was deactivated and you can see that there is no negative current going back to the battery in the plot. So in my opinion there is a bug in the app somewhere.

I assume your module can go onto VESC-X (Not sure cos of protective hard case and heat sink)? Might have to go for that if VESC 6 is taking too long to come out.

Yes it should work with VESC-X. I checked the PCB schematic and it has the same pin header. My module goes here:

And you pushed me to release my source code, under the guise of another person? I don't regret doing it and would likely have released it anyways, but still, you were pushing for my code. So how much of my code did you use and not give credit for?

Idk about the rest of this community, but I think we should have no tolerance for people who do this kind of shady stuff.

idk, He came out with his less than 12 hours after I released my app. So that make's me think he didn't just steal large chunks of code upfront. It's possible some of these later updates involved code I wrote.

The fact he wants this closed source gives more credibility in my mind that he has something to hide.

I don't think we'll ever know, but at best, he used his other account to see under the hood of my app, which gives him a market advantage in that he knows exactly what I'm doing and how.

He implemented a rides history in the same fashion I did weeks later, which is a place I'd like to see his code for.

As I already mentioned before. The only ones who complained that I didn't publish my sourcecode are the ones who have a business interest in it.
So maybe i should make some advertisement here for my app.

It's for free, It has video support and the modules cost you only around 3$ or 3‚Ç¨ and are available here (I don't earn anything).
You can make videos and switch the motor amps while you ride to fine tune your board.

if i am not mistaken then @evoheyax app is also for free.

Everyone, you can reverse-engineer my app and make sure I am not using anyone's code. This is easy and there are tools available. In fact, I did exactly the same thing with @Ackmaniac's app. There was a high probability he is using GPL'd UART library, but I was wrong. He doesn't use it. That's why he can keep his Android app closed source.

I am not going to publish the source just yet. I am actively working on it.

If anyone has enough technical knowledge to argue with me, please go on. @evoheyax @Ackmaniac you are welcome to see the parts of the source code you are interested in. PM me and we will arrange it.

My biggest concern right now is not the possibility that you stole large blocks of code. It's that your a known troll, and you created a new account to hide your identity, while using the trolling account to gain information about your competitors app.

And now, you just openly admitted that you hacked @Ackmaniac's app.

These are all abuses in my mind, that I don't think the community should tolerate. You don't care about this community or anyone in it. You care about pulling in a few quick bucks by spying and hacking your competition, and deceiving everyone about who you really are...

As far as I'm concerned, you have no credibility anymore...

Ok I got to step in. As one of the moderator I agree the suspend of a troll account. @lox897 will deal with it. However this post is about @rpasichnyk app module, keep it for the development of his module as it's. For dispute please inform the moderator about it and we will have a look then we will take action about it.

---

As a matter of fact (if I look at this properly) the source code of @evoheyax account is located at Gibhub openly, so everyone can have a look, change and do pull request upon changes. If someone look and do copy paste upon open source code project, please don't be mad as you have placed it at an open space. Please use bitbucket (similar to github) for close source project, they are for free as well.

---

Everyone here highly appreciate anyone effort in innovating and creating something new especially if they do it open source. However if you have them open sourced and copied and that someone else reproduced and do a better business, please don't be mad and ask for public execution. It's also unfair.

If someone comes along, and does a better job with my code than me, I'll be happy, as I stated, this was a tool for the community, and I want whats best for the community. What I don't like, and would be mad is, if someone takes my open source code, copies, and turns it closed source, for profit app. Under the licensing I used, anyone who uses my code is legally required to open source their project also. They also need to give proper credit (as I do) to those who have contributed code to that project. That is the law. Right now, he is insisting he's written it 100%, and it's closed sourced. So even if he's using one little function of mine, what he is doing is illegal. If he's not, than I have no further objections. One user, one account, and I'm fine with that.

His approach to this was to hack (he admitted he hacked @Ackmaniac's app) and convince his competition to release source code, under the guise of another person. I think this community personally should weed out vendors to some degree. He's been accused of using fake chips in conjunction with his app also. Do we as a community want these type of shady vendors, even if they offer innovations to the community? I think people like him hurt the credibility of other smaller vendors on this forum. It's hard to give someone you don't know in real life your money and expectation to deliver a product, the foundation of that is trust. I can't ask you to ban both accounts, those kinds of decision are your job as mods. I just want you to know where I'm coming from. Personally, I think a message should be sent that this is not ok. Allowing him to continue to sell here and removing his other account would send the message IMO that this community is ok with people who abuse the forum (and it seems we all agree, that the way he used multiple accounts is an abuse), as long as they offer some innovation. I'm fine with competition, and in fact, I have multiple others to compete with. Even if he were out of the equation, it wouldn't give me that much more business.

Again, just wanted to through my two cents into the equation. No matter what you guys decide as the final action here, I will respect your decision. I just want whats best for this community moving forward.

I totally agree with your disappointment in regards with the current situation and I believe alot more people from the community had noticed this negative behaviour in regards of impersonation (having 2 accounts). However I can't agree enough with this statement.

[/quote]

Because if you decide to open source, someone else rewrite it with the same style in ie different class names / variables names / different languages, I believe it's claimable as a 100% newly written. Especially also if he added or modified for his own needs. Personally I am also a web developer and I also contributed into Bootstrap project. However if some companies decided to take my code and make money of it, theres nothing I can do about it as I've made it public available in the first place. It would be very hard for you to really really really check. Copy + Change + Modify or rewrite int heir own words can't be placed under COPYING and thats a fact.

Google apply plagiarism as a ban method for websites / webshops. If everyone makes websites for selling electric longboard, they all share same story, keywords, key selling points, etc. That doesn't mean everyone is copying each other and deserved to be banned.

---

Personally I have no sides in here, but lets say now I forked your code then decided to make a new app and module to be used for electric bike. Then decided to use and sell it in different forum without you knowing it, you will never know. It's very hard to know. I really do suggest move your future code to bitbucket, give some people you trust permission. Let the one open, be open. Have your own custom work that you think valuable in bitbucket, so no one else can copy it. Therefore people can bug fix, help contribute, but you can still keep your special @evoheyax  feature closed as your unique selling point.

I guess I am the odd man out but I paid @jacobbloy 130.00 (that I will never see the money or product) for this same functionality as rpasichnyk.  To my knowledge I didnt see anyone else offering a way to set up and control my VESCs through my phone.  I dont need to buy VESCs anymore for my board addiction - just need to swap battery/VESC/Rx assembly to whatever board I want and load that config in my garage without a computer.  I bought both Evoheyax and rpasichnyk modules and dont think they are the same at all.  I bought Evoheyax hoping that one day it would be developed enough to do what Jacob promised (still a little bitter) and what rpasichnyk does now.   I see a purpose for both depending on your needs.

I work in the furniture design industry and other companies stand on my shoulders (copy me) all the time.  The trick is always be thinking of the next trend or functionality so while someone is copying you you are one step ahead with the next gen product.  It makes the people that copy you look like followers.  Every once in awhile I will run across someone that isnt solely about the money and will want to collaborate on designs - those have been the most successful so far. 

I havent been able to go back and see any wrong doing because the other account has been closed.

‚Ä¢ My apps are written from ground up and have 100% code written by me.

‚Ä¢ I offered code inspection if someone does not beleive it and my offer still stands.

‚Ä¢ My apps are identical for both iOS and Android. There is no way to run iOS program on Android if you just copy the code. This code is totally different and will not work for Android.

‚Ä¢ I did not hack anyones app. I used `aapt dump badging` and `aapt list -v` to see the basic information about apk and made logical conclusion that it doesn't use GPL library in question.

I guess that was Benjamin's intention.:joy: 
I think some people are simply cool and want to help others and feel better with it.
Why does Tesla share all it's patents.I think not because they think they can't make money with it.

It feels much better when somebody honors your work with money even if he doesn't have to. Of course it is only a fraction of the amount you can make when you would sell it. And when you sell it then marketing is more important then quality so you are forced to shout out stuff like "My apps are miles ahead of competition".

And if "miles ahead" means how many miles have been ridden with the apps then i think this will change soon.

‚Ä¢ GPS coordinates and elevation tracking

All these takes time and effort. It is sad that you can't appreciate. You haven't been supportive from the moment you came into this thread. You are probably waiting until I slip up again. But I will use your advice and will go and work hard and earn the trust again. Thank you.

@Ackmaniac I agree that opensource is cool but I think you should speek about Benjamin and Tesla after you opensource yourself. So far you are keeping your Android app closed. You are not making money with it, but free is not the same thing as opensource.

I don't know if he copied any code but as a metr.at user i'm happy, works great and I've contribuited as well to help him to continue this amazing project.

I see metr.at as a service, yes, you have to pay for  it, but common guys he spend a lot of time (to add features, fix bugs) and also put money on It (app licences, hosting, domain, ssl) that's not free, do you think that it's not fair to charge a little bit?

It's fair to charge... Not cool to give someone hell over their app being closed and then releasing a closed app that is direct competition to the app you trolled the dev to be open. It makes it look like he wanted a peek under the competitions hood to better their own app and sell it. 

His app is great I bet and well worth the money too but some will not, for moral reasons, deal with him.

Someone send me a zip file of the .apk's for the apps you all are arguing about and ill settle if anyone stole code. I am a reverse engineer-er, check my github account (same username) that will prove that i am. I'll reverse the apps in question and provide a purely technical opinion if they share code.

1. Check that your watch is paired with your phone.
2. Check that you have metr in the list of the installed apps on your watch. If you don't, run "Resync apps" in "Watch" app on your phone.
3. Run metr on your watch. It should display a string "Run metr on your phone".
4. Run metr on your phone.
5. Enter layout editing mode in Realtime Tab (long press) and enable which values you want to see on your watch.

@rpasichnyk Since the update with the new layout and icon, my own configuration was lost. It's fine though, however there are new parameters which are not clear to me what are those. The icons didn't tell much about what data is being shown. Could you please update your first post what each parameter & icons means.

Hi Roman,

Great work btw.

Would it be possible to have a battery gauge tile added with % charge remaining? 

Since this is primarily a software effort, would it be possible to get discounts on 2nd or 3rd BT modules if we have multiple boards?  

Thanks!

Hola!

‚Ä¢ üá™üá∏@tueboard and üá©üá™@hexakopter contributed Spanish and German translations. I'm sure some people will find it very useful. Danke!

‚Ä¢ The app now records fault codes and displays them on the chart. Now you will know exactly when something bad happened to your VESC.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/f/df38786aaabdf26f9ba77b7a8daf5beaddd0b263.gif" width="400" height="231">
https://metr.at/r/QVZzZ

‚Ä¢ Apple Watch support is now LIVE!
https://youtu.be/6r8rQUBBPW0

‚Ä¢ I think I solved some of the mysteries of @hexakopter's ride https://metr.at/r/EKA4T

1. Distance was negative because it is calculated based on tacho count from VESC. The app remembers the tacho count at the start of the record and in the end of the record. Then it does `tachoToDistance(tachoEnd - tachoStart)`. Tacho values come from VESC. `tachoStart` was lower than `tachoEnd` because VESC lost the power after reset. That's why distance was negative.
2. Energy was negative because of the same reason. I fixed both distance and energy and now they should display correct values even if the VESC was reset during the recording.

@guyguy I will add battery gauge tile :)

@laurnts It's unfortunate your configuration was lost. I don't know why this happened, the layout should stay the same after you update. Let me know if this happens again. And you are right about icons not telling the full story. I added labels for each tile which you can see now in Editing Mode:

Very nice update! will test the apple watch app tonight.

I noticed in the last week I sometimes loose the record. Maybe because the app closes on the background? But it happened multiple times after different duration. Maybe it will solve if by activating screen on option.

However it would be nice if the record would automatically save every xx seconds.

@sebaszz Thank you for reporting this problem. Loosing record is not cool! Sometimes iOS can kill the application when in the background. Hopefully with the latest update the situation gets a little bit better. The app saves the record on "low memory warning" so at least some data will survive. I will investigate this further, perhaps there could be other cases.

@zmoney I use [Qt](https://www.qt.io). The app is mostly written in C++ and QML but I do use  Objective-C and Swift and Java because not everything is possible with Qt.

@ElskerShadow I really appreciate your help with the French translation. Thank you! You need to check how many pins you have on I2C/UART/ADC port (marked red).

It's 6 pins on the picture because the VESC is of earlier revision (VESC 4.6). You can check your revision or just count the number of pins. The newer VESC has 7 pins. If your VESC is from Enertion there is a chance it doesn't have JST PH housing connector (marked red).

Yes it looks like no data from bluetooth is coming but GPS and barometer keep functioning properly. The bluetooth drops just about 30 seconds after start. However on the other record you have 3 minutes without issues. I actually don't know what's wrong, might be because of high currents creating electromagnetic fields around the transmitter. Maybe you could try to position transmitter differently if it happens again. And if it happens again, please go to Settings tab and click "Send logs" and drop me a message after that.

You ride very fast, I hope you wear all kinds of protective gear :construction_worker:

Sorry to keep bugging with feature request :) - Would it be possible to have a trip playback mode on the website (e.g. you hit play on the website, and it plays back on the timeline instead of having to drag the cursor over it)? The purpose would be for making esk8 videos - it would be easy to line up time stamps on videos so I can edit in a recorded trip as an overlay.

The new version is out with some updates:

‚Ä¢ üá´üá∑ French translation (thanks to @ElskerShadow!)

‚Ä¢ Battery Tile. The value is calculated based on your VESC limits and current voltage. Please make sure you set **Maximum input voltage** to the voltage that your battery has when  fully charged and **Battery cutoff end** to the voltage when it has no charge left.

‚Ä¢ You can now turn on **Notifications**. Imagine the app is running in the background, display is off and the phone is in your pocket. Suddenly Bluetooth disconnects or even worse VESC fault happens. You will get a notification which will make a usual sound and/or vibrate.

‚Ä¢ Added possibility **not** to upload location data but still use GPS for distance and speed calculation

‚Ä¢ Small speed and memory optimizations for iOS which should hopefully help older devices to keep the app running in the background and not being killed.

I am very excited about VESC 6.0 and it is very high prio on my list of things. The goal is to support it as soon as it comes out. I keep contact with a person who is in the VESC 6.0 beta program and he kindly offered his help with the testing. Everyone else is also welcome to report bugs. I do not recommend writing settings or doing motor detection with perimetr app on your fresh VESC 6.0 before I let you know it's no risk. But using metr should be safe. It only fetches realtime data and motor configuration and doesn't write anything.

Hi, 

I think I found a problem with metr.at when using it for a long ride, it doesn't seem to keep the phone awake.

Do you think I need to keep my phone awake from time to time myself or is my setup wrong? (look at the following ride after 9:50 am), I tried an open source vesc monitor for iOs by @gpxlben ( https://github.com/gpxlBen/VESC_Logger ) and that kept recording

https://metr.at/r/tsD5H ([mkv3](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mkv3-vesc-4-12-carvon-2-5v-hubs-10s4p-mkv2-rework/18119?u=makevoid) - carvon v2.5 dual vesc 10s - monitoring only 1 vesc)

Anyway cool, it works both on ios and android, is it web based? (cordova or similar?)  - In that case maybe these two links for the power management API can help  ([android](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.WakeLock.html))  - ([cordova](https://github.com/cranberrygame/cordova-plugin-powermanagement)) or maybe that is an issue only on my setup you think?

thanks

Hi and thank you for reporting this and even providing the solution. I was aware of the sleep problem on Android but I didn't think there was such a simple workaround as `PowerManager.WakeLock`.

I pushed the updated version to Google Play, please test it when you have time.

I would like to get the motor current as well as the input current, I think is an interesting data to have to gauge acceleration and braking but probably is not needed by default (I agree it can be confusing and very near to the input current sometimes) or maybe it's generally not needed at all and everything is perfect as it is :smiley: (you already did a great job as it is I think) .

I would like to summarize a lot of small fixes that I've recently made to the metr app and the website:

* There were some problems with bluetooth connection. Sometimes the app did not reconnect (especially when in the background) and even worse, after reconnecting it could not parse incoming data. After fixing the problems I did a lot of torture tests, moving between two rooms covering my phone with the body (it blocks even better than walls :smile: ). Disconnecting for a long time, then for a short times, disconnecting then almost reconnecting back, but body block in the last second, no matter how hard I try to break the connection, it always comes back online now :rocket:

* During my tests I added a small blink to the connection icon. It blinks every time the app receives some data from the transmitter. I decided to keep it since it looks kinda nice.

* I enabled iTunes file sharing for offline access to the records. If you don't want to upload the data, it's your choice. But I bet you really want to because web view became so much better :sunglasses: (more on that below).

    <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/0/60ca21b478218017071288eee99aa2bb292373bf.jpg" width="500">

* I want to thank @makevoid once more because he posted a really long record (55 min). It almost hit the limits of the web view. Rendering was taking about 5 seconds which was like forever, scrolling wasn't smooth and I got a little bit sad and decided to rewrite the whole thing. I threw away heavy Google Charts and replaced it with a simple HTML `<canvas>`, which turned out to be super-fast in comparison. I also splitted up the axes and distanced them from each other a little bit so they don't intersect that much. In my opinion this helps to increase readability.

* If you take a closer look at the short summary of the ride in the middle of the screen you will see it got a nice addition - max temperature. And even better you can now click on the values and immediately see that particular moment when and where that happened.

    <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/f/3f18d4276db78e7d86afc95b7badb9d81f14bcee.gif" width="320">

* The last thing is about chart scrolling. First, you can now do it with your mouse, hold Alt and scroll the mouse wheel. Second, if you try it on your phone you will notice it now supports momentum scrolling. Slow scrolling is no more.

All the changes I mentioned are already online. The next big feature that is coming very very soon is **OVERLAY**.

Basically there are 3 default overlays available:

What I really wish though is if someone of you could create your own. This is not that hard, even if you never did front-end web development, you can take existing preset and just start changing it bit by bit, colors and fonts, position of the text labels. Click "apply" and see if it works. Ask here if you need some assistance.

It is not a bug, the video generated in Chrome has to be as narrow as possible, otherwise it will take ages to generate. After downloading you can pad it with `ffmpeg` to make iMovie happy. The magic command for `vertical` preset is

`ffmpeg -i overlay.webm -crf 1 -vf "pad=w=1920:h=1080:x=1620:y=0:color=green" overlay.mp4`

I have just tested it to generate the video for an old log. The log was around 5 minutes long, but it takes 6 minutes to generate the video in chrome. I like your idea to use the browser to generate the files, but it takes to long. Benjamins QT application overlays the VESC data in realtime with the big problem that you need to have the laptop/camera hocked up to the VESC while logging. 
So I think your browser overlay is a nice feature for "makers", but definitely not for the majority.

I haven't tried on mac but on windows it's very very fast on Chrome. I don't know why but for me on Linux it's not completing, the chrome tab went out of memory (it got limited around 1.5 GB) I had to use firefox but for ~1h ride it used 14GB of  memory out of the 16 I have . There's definately a memory leak/problem and it could be related to the js library used to makethe video from the html canvas to webm. I believe @rpasichnyk is using [whammy](https://github.com/antimatter15/whammy) which seems a library that is stable from long time. I researched a bit and stumbled upon [ccapture](https://github.com/spite/ccapture.js/) which seems new but probaby it's also more performant? I don't know I never tried any of the two.

Anyway I modified the doom HTML/CSS/JS overlay and made this from one ride log:

https://youtu.be/easf8889wXg

I still need to wait a bit and get a new gimbal to make a decent video with the overlay. 

Here's the modified code if you want to use it: https://gist.github.com/makevoid/cd239f90939d9881c46133460b5ef0ff

note on the JS part I [put a variable](https://gist.github.com/makevoid/cd239f90939d9881c46133460b5ef0ff#file-index-js-L5) that you can use to multiply the stats to the number of vescs you have

@makevoid Thank you for the feedback! I tried your long record (CoFQt) with your layout from github on macOS and it was okay, took around 11 minutes + 5GB of RAM, of which 1GB was compressed memory. I think compressed memory is why I was able to get away with it. On Ubuntu there is no such thing by default, I don't know what linux distro you are using but it's likely the same situation. Windows 10 also has memory compression.

Yes I am using whammy. I looked at ccapture, it uses whammy internally, so basically nothing new :) Since overlay didn't work on Ubuntu out of the box, I had to fix it and luckily I think I managed to do it. I found a place where a lot of memory was wasted and fixed that. Now chrome process consumes around 700mb for your 59 minute record.

Also, don't try Firefox, it can not encode images as webp.

@Pedrodemio no, you can't plug two things into one UART port. But if you have dual VESC setup, then you have 2 ports.

Thanks, for now I have single VESC, but I will change to PPM so I can use your module, the idea was to make a battery meter on the controller, all hardware are in place but I never implemented

In a dual VESC linked via can, your app sim the data from both VESC's? At least battery current and energy

My app gets the data only from one VESC. But you can change the CAN Fwd ID in my app to specify which VESC to communicate with. I am thinking about a good way of getting data from multiple VESCs at the same time without sacrificing the frequency.

Is there any processing capability on the transmitter? If that's the case, you could sum most of the data there such as energy, battery current, etc, the only thing that would have to be doubled are motor current, duty cycle and maybe temperature, that would reduce the packet size and keep the a good update interval

@Michael319 do I understand right, when you loose traction, your wheel starts spinning so fast, as if you were going 80km/h ? Is a split second really enough time for that to happen?

@Pedrodemio no, transmitter just acts like a bridge. But there's plenty of processing power on the VESC and you are thinking in the right direction.

The "distance" cell is for total distance travelled from the moment the application is started or the VESC is powered up.

I looked today at your findings and figured out what's wrong. If there's no record currently in progress, the distance cell is not updating. Unless "Prefer GPS" is enabled as mentioned by @makevoid. I will include the fix for this bug in the next version, until then possible workarounds:

1. Leave "Prefer GPS" disabled, start a record, distance cell will show updates or
2. Enable "Prefer GPS"

Thank you for reporting the bug!

This looks really promising.  I read the whole thread - a fair bit of drama and glad to see it calm down a bit.

Roman - thanks for the hard work and really frequent updates.  I'm impressed with the quick action to fix things, and including folks requests on your "to-do" list, then implementing quickly.  Impressive.

I nearly bought a few other similar utilities.  I have bought 2 from your site - i wish you had the ability to add to a cart and not pay shipping twice!  I'll shoot you a PM and see if i can get the second shipping refunded or applied to a 3rd one.

I'd like to try this with VESC X, and i'm on Beta for VESC 6 - have you tested with VESC X yet?  Any update on the Beta VESC 6?

I was on the fence until i saw the ability save "modes" - so i can hand to a friend and give it "Beginner" settings so they don't hurt themselves.  This has been a huge wish-list item for me.  I usually pull the battery apart and only give them 6s to start so they cannot hurt themselves.  This seems perfect and can do it on the fly!

Thank you sir!

I am still thinking about alternative version of Realtime Tab, not quite sure how it should look like. But in the meantime I made a small change that should make layout editing easier:

####Grid Step

If you want easier editing, increase the step from 10 to 20 or 40. If you want finer tuning, decrease it to 5, 2, or even 1

I have also added **poor man's [charger with customizeable end-of-charge voltage](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/cheap-chargers-with-customizeable-end-of-charge-voltage/6902)**. If you sit in the same room where you charge your battery, you can configure this in Settings to whatever voltage you like. When the battery reaches it, you will get notification on your device. Unplug the charger and increase your battery life :deciduous_tree:

I slowed it down to 93% of the original export speed, I think I have like 1-2 sec difference at the end but they're almost in sync.

I probably need to accelerate and brake like 3 times in a row to set a "marker" that will let me synchronize the video with the log as my camera doesn't timestamp the video (:/)

I flashed my firmware to the extended bldc tool. Now it shows this voltage https://metr.at/r/U0nVt
Which is just multiplied by 10 for some reason

## \#269 Posted by: rpasichnyk Posted at: 2017-04-29T17:17:48.272Z Reads: 206

Because the voltage value is saved with different multiplier to the command buffer

`ACKMANIAC_Sources/bldc-firmware/commands.c:181`

A lot of receivers use the PPM-signal (RC-Servo) port. But when you have a receiver that is already using the UART/I2C port the only possibility would be two VESCs right now, connected over the CAN bus.

I fixed some bugs yay :)

* Fix distance calculation when 'Prefer GPS' is enabled (thanks to @hexakopter). We did some tests with other GPS apps such as 'runastic road bike' and 'wahoo fitness' and results are closer now.
* Fix Upload Location option not always working properly (thanks to @hexakopter).
* Add incremental wh and distance updates to every record. This will allow to see how much energy was consumed and distance travelled in the zoomed area.
* Add timestamps to all points of the record to fix overlay timings (thanks to @makevoid). I think the reason for slight overlay speed up is inaccuracy of programmatic timer. For example if you have 'Timeout interval' set to 500ms, sometimes it is 490, sometimes 510, 520, etc. In a longer run it all adds up, maybe background mode can also make an impact. I updated my overlay presets, @makevoid you can apply this patch to your preset to make use of the timestamps. This will only affect future records that were recorded with the new app version => v1.5.15
```
+  var elapsed = record.interval;
+  if (record.version >= 5) {
+    elapsed = record.elapsed[index];
+    if (index > 0) {
+      elapsed -= record.elapsed[index - 1];
+    }
+  }
+
   setTimeout(() => {
-    addFrame(record.interval, next);
+    addFrame(elapsed, next);
   }, 0);
 }

My phone sees it in bluetooth settings and I have a bluetooth sniffer app that can see it, and it shows up sometimes in other VESC apps, but in metr I click scan and it just scans until it times out. Any ideas? Did I get a faulty one? VESC is set to PPM + UART and Baud Rate is set to 115200...

I don't know if it is useful to use the VESC max voltage to calculate it. When you change the max voltage inside BLDC Tool that means that a higher voltage reading will shut down the VESC when I am not mistaken. So when you are using regenerative breaking you can exceed this max voltage and the controller disables the output. That is at least what I think could happen.
So for me it makes more sense to have the voltage of your fully charged battery adjustable in the metr.at app and the max voltage setting inside the VESC a little bit higher. That also means that the metr.at app (instead of the perimetr app) don't need to read any of the stored VESC settings data, just the realtime data. Maybe that would be also useful with the future VESC Tool protocol when you know what I mean. :wink:

I was wondering about this too.  Can you please program an option to set the battery voltage inside Metr?  You don't really want the VESC max voltage limit set to your fully charged battery. You need a buffer or braking on a nearly charged battery may cause the VESC to cutout

@sl33py @caustin the support for new firmware is almost ready, at least for metr. Big thanks to @hexakopter who helped a lot with research and testing, this would not be possible otherwise in so short time. There are couple of small things left, I hope by the end of this week you will all get the new version. Perimetr is another story, it needs whole lot more time for research and there is still a risk to break something, so I would prefer to wait until the firmware source code is available.

@jackw battery tile configuration coming together with new firmware support (very soon). You will be able to select number of cells (10S, 12S, etc) and battery type (Li-Po or Li-Ion).

There are more goodies in this version:

* Automatic records. If you sometimes forget to start or stop the record like I do, you will find this useful.

I don't know if anyone already suggested it but would it be possible to implement total mileage tracking specific to Bluetooth module? I know it probably can be achieved by recording data, but it would be nice if app could keep track of it sort of separately. Another idea to consider is to change name of Bluetooth module so switching between boards in app could look like "mountainboard" / "longboard", in my opinion this could make this awesome app even more user friendly.

I have been using your app daily for several months now, and I wanted to say Great Job! Working pretty great overall.  I have been keeping a list of ideas for future improvements and some minor bugs I have encountered on the way. Mainly it is a list of "it would cool if"s.  I'll share them when I have more time...  


P.S.  I feel like your thread title should include your app's name "Metr" somehow.  Maybe something simple like:   _Metr: Configuration and Telemetry for VESC [iOS, Android]_.  I think it would be easier for new users. Let me know what you want, and I could update the title for you if desired

Just received the bluetooth module, and was just out for a test ride. and it`s working wonderful :-) 
I have some quistions though

I recorded my ride.
But why is it not possible to se total mAh/ Amp consumption afterwards ? When i fly racing drones, the most important telemetry funktion is when you need to land, and flying after total mAh consumption is the best way to know.

And why is it not possible to se the total length of the ride on my mobilephone, i first need to push uploade.

But man this is cool projekt.
Thanks.....:-)<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/e/6ecb8ad65db2b3e1626195d4fbb6cbb927f25116.png" width="281" height="500">

Hi Roman, I have a small bug report. When the options "Prefer GPS" and "Automatic records" are active, the app will keep starting a record even when standing still, because the GPS thinks I move slightly all the time. Maybe it shouldn't start a record based on the GPS speed? Or add some kind of threshold in the GPS speed before it starts :) 

And also, I tried reinstalling the app to get the Bluetooth board to connect again, and it worked once, and now I can't get it to connect at all... It may be a iOS 11 bug, I don't know. But I can see in the status bar that the board connects, and I can even see the name in iOS settings (not the app settings), but the app won't see it. 

Thanks! Can't wait for the module alias function! Then I'll have to order another module for my second board! :D

Not really an answer but if you use Android and hit accept at some point Google keeps track of your trip history.  I like to go back and relabel all the stuff it assumes I'm driving or biking with skateboarding to see my total travel distance and get a nice map.

Or go to maps.google.com or open on your smartphone and go to the menu then Timeline.

[/quote]

Try increasing "Start delay", this might help. For example, set it to 30 or 60 seconds? Actually "Prefer GPS" should be enabled in a very specific cases, when the motor does not spin all the time (think freewheel). If you do not have a freewheel, do not enable "Prefer GPS". Your distance and speed will be calculated more accurately based on wheel diameter and motor RPM.

* displays correct voltage when used with Extended firmware (not multiplied by 10). Ping @rwxr @Michael319
* adds more data to JSON (ah, ahRegen, whRegen, elapsedAh, elapsedAhRegen, elapsedWhRegen, rpm) - thanks to @hexakopter for the idea!

Hey Roman,

Your beta tester from a while back here. Just wondering if you're still using 115200 as the baud rate for your module. I was under the impression that a lower rate (like 9600) is more reliable. I noticed there were a lot of connection issues on my beta unit.
```

---
## \#332 Posted by: rpasichnyk Posted at: 2017-07-01T20:07:05.502Z Reads: 185

Yes, I am still using 115200. If you have USB to TTL converter you can change the baud rate of the module by sending `AT+BAUD4` (this is 9600) command. Change back to 115200 by sending `AT+BAUD8`. I also have issues with connection on my board during high peak currents, but I never thought changing the baud rate may help with this. I will test your suggestion, thanks!
```

## \#333 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2017-07-01T20:09:56.055Z Reads: 189

From what I understand higher baud rates give faster data transfer speeds, but is more sensitive to data loss and affected by cable length, while lower rates have slower speeds, but are more reliable. I think this is why 9600 is default for a lot of applications.

I don't think I need a replacement, because I just tested with an iOS 10 device, and it works. So it must be an iOS 11 compatibility issue. :)

@Jinra I just came from a long ride with BAUD rate 9600 and it was much much better, I did not have any connection problems, even during high currents. 9600 is still enough to send packets with 250ms interval, so I think it's a winner. Thank you again for this suggestion. I will think about some user-friendly way to change the module's BAUD rate from the VESC without unplugging, maybe by introducing extra command. In the meantime if someone has connection problems because of high BAUD rate you can PM me and we will figure out how to change.

@Silverline I am running out of space on that row so I don't know really :sweat_smile:

* Automatic Records (ON/OFF and start/stop delays)
* System (Metric/Imperial)
* Theme (White/Dark)

I've been using this app for several months now, and this issue only just started recently.  Any idea what could be causing this?  Thanks!

@rpasichnyk Thank you for your fast shipping of the BT module, it works perfectly. :) I have now had a good handful runs on my eMTB and though I have limited experience, I do have a tiny feature request I hope you would consider implementing. :)

I would love to have Ah usage as a battery meter! I come from drone racing where I have been using LiPos for years and the main parameter I need for my batteries are the amount of Ah I can pull from them. This gives me a near perfect status of the battery, including an indicator of when they begin to age/wear out due to voltage sag and lost capacity.

The app already includes [ElapsedAh] and if you included a possibility to enter two more parameters it should be an easy job to create a working battery-bar and a tile to show consumed Ah. :)

The two missing parameters are:

* Max Ah consumption
* Number of motors (as stats are only read from the attached motor on a multi-drive setup)

I run a 12S LiPo setup with 5,8Ah and dual drive. I would consider a safe consumption would be around 3,5Ah. This would set my parameters as follows:

* [MaxAhConsumption] = 3,5
* [NumberOfMotors] = 2

Example: [ElapsedAh] of 1,62
1,62 * 2 = **3,24 Ah** out of a maximum of 3,5Ah

Shown as percentage use "100 - ( [ElapsedAh] * [NumberOfMotors] ) / [MaxAhConsumption] * 100"
100-(1,62*2)/3,5*100 = **7,428571%** battery left

**_EDIT the day after posting:_**

I just realized my ideas would work great when starting the board fully charged but also that it would be useless in all other cases - I suppose it would be possible to make the app remember the last state and then add a "reset battery" button, but that seems tiresome and prone to user error. Another way to "calculate" this could be a comparison between min and max voltage, and set the [ElapsedAh] to the number corresponding with the voltage on startup.
This adds a bit of complexity I had not thought of at first. Damn! :) 


That was a whole lot, I hope it makes sense :)
Thanks

You can use metr app with any firmware. You only need custom firmware in order to write settings with perimetr app.

@SilentException Yes, those are relevant changes, looks good! But wait, it's a trap :slight_smile:
This idea does not make any sence

1) I think @Ackmaniac already did similar fixes (partially, no motor detection) because it is possible to write settings with his app
2) If you try to write settings with perimetr you will face an obstacle that my app requires firmware version 2.18 while Extended firmware is version 2.54 or something
3) If you go further and change the version of Extended firmware to 2.18 this will result in unexpected behaviour because perimetr sends a structure MC_CONF without Extended parameters (without watt curves etc.)

@rpasichnyk have you had a chance to check on battery charge end notification?

BTW it would be cool to have option to choose a warning or notification of low battery voltage to prevent over discharge. Preferably a loud noise or constant vibration ofd the hone until user acknowledges the alert - something like when timer goes off on the iphone. What do you think? It would replace my voltage meter :D  

Another thought - recording voltage sag - lowest voltage and pinpointing it to the graph and map?

Is this a know issue? I have the same behavior on 2 ios phones.

I also noticed with automatic recording. Switching off power  after end of ride. Gives undervoltage fault but then the duration keeps on counting for +10 min, So a 6 min ride will be stored as 20 min. (with undervoltage fault)

But it is still a great app!  also the apple watch app is great!

@MontPierre duty cycle is basically how often VESC pumps the current into the motor. 95% duty cycle means that you have reached maximum. But RPM of the motor stays the same on your record, even goes down. That was what I was talking about. I hope you will fix this issue :) Also my advice is to disable "Prefer GPS" setting and make sure your pulley and wheel diameter are correct. Your speed and range will be calculated using rpm, which is more accurate!

@Esrapp21 you are welcome! I remember you wanted avg current ;)

@rpasichnyk i didn't manage to test the the app yet, i accidentally shorted my VESC just before i received the module, my VESC 6 is a few days away, but two questions

-Any progress on how to handle two VESC's connected via CAN? maybe a approach like @Ackmaniac that it just multiply the relevant values by two for now would be ok

-Would be possible to add grade to the graph? doing the height diference for a given distance or even pulling that information from Google Maps itself. Ebikes.ca trip simulator does that way and i find it reasonably accurate. My fear is that GPS will have a low precision on the elevation for the data to be meaningful

-make it 3, adding wh/km in this new tab of data would be really helpful to 

Thanks

@rpasichnyk You should consider additional business model. I have my own BT MODULE but I'd love to use your app. What I suggest is that you should make IN-APP PURCHASE option for IOS for let say 10$ for those who already have their own BT's but want to use your app.  If someone doesn't have BT they will still buy it from for 23$ as it is good deal for them to get BT+APP. That's a win win situation for everyone.

@rpasichnyk thanks for the app update! Unfortunately it hasn't charged anything - still no notification. I do get a red dot on the app icon sometimes - unfortunately no notification to light up locked screen or interrupt other app. 

I have another request - would you be able to add option to modify voltage value of 0% of the battery ? 

For example so with lipos 0% would be 3.6V? Or 36.00 with 10s -adjustable. 

At the moment it must be hard coded and I get to 30% and for me it is the lowest I would go with lipos and everyone discharges them differently ;)

EDIT

Just restarted board, app was running in the background and I have received battery charged notification as soon as app connected to Bluetooth module after board restart. Weird... and board is long time charged ;)

Watt-hours gives you a much better picture of energy consumption, because it is normalized for voltage.  Watt-hours are invariant of battery level.  Using amp-hours is not a very good gauge because 1Ah on a full battery yields much more energy than 1Ah on an empty battery.  But 1 Watt-hour is always 1 Watt-hour

Personally I would really love to see **Watt-hours/mile**

@jmasta I agree with you but same Wh can very easy result in different Ah depending on riding style and voltage sag. This is why it is also nice to see Ah. Some batteries have fixed Ah and you can use this information to estimate how much is left.

Take the nominal voltage of the cell (3.6V) and multiply it by its nominal capacity (3000 mAh = 3 Ah).  Each 30Q cell has 10.8 Wh.

[quote="Silverline, post:431, topic:13483, full:true"]
So when i reach about 540Wh on a trip, it`s time to go home ??


[/quote]

It will vary based on how much current you draw (just like how Ah varies).  540 Wh would be the best you could get.   Based on discharge charts, 500 Wh is a good estimate.  But running 5P means you won't be stressing your battery as hard

Watt-hours is useful for us because many of us have different pack voltages. So it's easier to compare my 12S board to your 10S board, for example

Here is the record. I was using the horizontal preset. As a side note I forgot to mention the bluetooth disconnected a few times during the ride too.

Here is my setup for anyone with interest in the stats. So some of the records stats are x 2 too since this is reading only one vesc.
- 2 x 170kv 6355
- 2 x vesc-x in foc and soon to be sensored.
- 8s3p A123 Pack at 7500mah
- 2 x 16/40 gears 280-5m-12 and TB's V4's
- 97mm flywheels

Unfortunately horizontal preset consumes memory like hell and 24 minutes is too long for it. Try vertical? In the meantime I will try to simplify horizontal a little bit and remove some stuff so the rectangle is smaller.

While looking around, I found 2 bugs
1) barometer readings not recorded
2) timestamps inside app record view chart are wrong

I fixed them and they will go into the next update

Yesterday the latest update of metr app v1.7.23 went live and I encourage everyone to update, there are many bug fixes and some new features. I want to thank everyone who reports the bugs, this is very helpful as I often don't notice when things break! Props to all of you! :heart:

I want specifically thank Lorenzo Cella from [Bolt Motion](https://boltmotion.com) for contributing Italian translation and @tueboard for contributing updated Spanish translation. Thank you!

Also I am happy to announce that I struck a deal with Bolt Motion and now all their skateboards will come with metr bluetooth module preinstalled (and with the easiest setup ever, pulley teeth and wheel diameter and battery all of that will be pre-configured).

Back to working on new features and improvements :construction_worker: :tools:

Go to Settings and click the gear icon next to your module's name.  Add a settings override for 12S voltage.   Then it will remain at 12S, even after a reset

@rpasichnyk is working on a fix, but this is a good workaround for the time being

Thanks for the update. My old records still crash the app. I figured they would though. The good news is the realtime data config remains after woot. I will make some new records over the weekend.

FYI I just updated iTunes. Well it updated itself really... Looks like they are no longer supporting the apps and are concentrating on music and such. I think it will all be done on the device now. The metr app files can still be found under file sharing. This surprised me a bit. I used to arrange my apps in iTunes. No matter I guess its just as easy on the device.

Only thing is I can't connect to my module. When I scan I don't see my module.

Any change, you could write a simplified app for All the standalone Android 5,1 smart watches ? That would be cool and easy , to simply connect the watch to the dongle. And then its easy always to se the speed , battery level etc. To first start the app on the phone , then connect the watch to the phone , is just a pain in the ass.

Hi @rpasichnyk, I just stumbled upon next idea. I personally don't charge my LiPos to full voltage per cell (I keep them fully charged at 4,17, so they'll last longer), because of this app never shows full battery, only something like 88-90%. It would be nice to be able to set fully charged and discharged cell limits. You know some people have habits to discharge batteries more than the others, and this would allow app to be more "personal" üôÇ

Oh and one more thing, I couldn't find motor temp tile in main screen set up (I believe motor temp monitoring is not implemented yet in the app?), adding one for VESC SIX users would be nice too üòé

@squad I did a 22km ride yesterday. Started with a fully charged battery. The app read 90% at full charge. My BMS charges to 3.5v per cell instead of 3.6 though. Would that account for the 10% difference? I'm totally fine with that if thats the case. 

Really happy to have the anr26650 added rpasichnyk. Thank you. The values you added seem almost perfect for the battery capacity. The realtime data page show my entire trip in one shot. Just under 22kms, but there were four records. Also the bluetooth must have notified me 40 times that it cut out. The module is beside one of the vesc's but not near the power or phase wires. There is one thin layer of carbon fibre on the flange of my enclosure to keep it from cracking when its bolted down, but thats all. I really don't have any problems with any of this. Just reporting. I'm gonna try to find a new spot for the module and test. Also going to order another module for my new build :slight_smile:

Yes, perimetr does support CAN forward and it works out of the box, you do not need to configure it in the app. It will try to increase CAN ID from 0 and up until there is no response and present you with a button for each VESC

Frankly I am not sure, but try 24, 28 and maybe 14 :grinning: Definitely leave pulleys 1 : 1
As an idea you can edit layout so you have **GPS speed** and **speed** side by side and compare them when you move (please be careful and look forward all the time, not on the screen)

Another idea is move the board exactly 100 meters and check the distance?

Not possible, but you can have GPS speed and rpm
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/f/3fefc465b209e10fae571f2563da7951e0cfb58d.png" width="200">

then calculate distance per revolution
 `dpr = wheelDiameter(mm) / 1000 * 3.14159 * motorPulleyTeeth / wheelPulleyTeeth`

speed(kph)
`speed = rpm * dpr / motorPoles * 2 * 60 / 1000`

In your case
`speed = rpm * wheelDiameter / motorPoles * 0,0003768`

So if you know the speed you can calculate motor poles
`motorPoles = rpm * wheelDiameter * 0,0003768 / speed`

Do not forget to turn on **Prefer GPS** in Settings ‚Üí Location

I would love to see this as well

If you had the option to "star" or flag a record, it would super useful.  I have hundreds of records, and the important ones tend to get lost 

Alternatively or in addition to this:   Could you please add some kind of marking if a fault occurred?  For example, automatically display a "!!!" next to the record if any fault was triggered

@ElskerShadow try installing metr app on Android. Force close VESC Monitor and perimetr if they are running.

Same thing on iOS. Make sure perimetr is not running in the background. I remember I had a terrible bug on iOS when communication just didn't work and the only thing that helped is deleting the app and installing it again. Unfortunately, this will delete all your records. Best if you have another iOS device to test first. You can use iTunes to export all your records and then reinstall the app and import back via iTunes.

The only baud rate that works with my module is 115200.
@monkey32 check that you have UART enabled and 115200 baud rate via VESC Tool.

1) Check that you have baud rate set to 115200 and UART enabled on your VESC
2) Check that your android phone is not stealing BT connection. Shut it down.
3) When you power on the VESC, the LED on the module should blink (1 sec ON, 1 sec OFF)
Fire up metr app and click Scan. When you find the module and select it, the LED on the module should stay always ON. At this point all should work.

Does it help?

That looks great. Can you make the overlay tool exporting just the overlay on a green screen? like the web tool? reason for this is that i would not like the tool to re-compress the video. It would be nice to have the tool and configure overlay/ride and just export green screen footage to be later overlaid by the user in other apps like FCPX.

```
@rpasichnyk quick question: i got your module and app and i have a few questions/problems:

1) How do you calculate percentage for battery? How many volts is 0%? Also, can we set it up ourselves, rather than just input battery type and S number (or even read bat cutoff min from vesc and use that?). Apart from that, discharging is not linear so it would be nice to be able to apply a curve to have a more realistic percentage indicator. I think somebody posted an example of the Evolve discharge curves but I'm sure we can find some for 18650 cells for example.

2) The Perimetr app doesn't seem to read values from the second vesc. It detects I have two vescs and reads the settings from the first one fine but when I select the second one and click read, it times out / errors.

3) on metr.at app can I save a ride data without the need to upload to your servers?

Thanks!
```

## \#518 Posted by: rpasichnyk Posted at: 2017-11-06T13:37:27.920Z Reads: 135

```
@egzplicit good idea, thank you! I will add export option with overlay only and transparent background.

1) I use following discharge curves. First value is 100%, last value is 0%. At the moment it is not possible to change them, but let me know if the curve for your cells differs too much
```
 lipoCurve: [4.2, 4.13, 4.06, 3.99, 3.92, 3.85, 3.78, 3.71, 3.64, 3.5, 3.4]
 liionCurve: [4.2, 4.11, 4.02, 3.93, 3.84, 3.75, 3.66, 3.57, 3.48, 3.39, 3.2]
```
2) Check that your VESCs are connected with CAN and they have different ID. I recommend setting ID 0 for master and ID 1 for slave VESC and connect BT module to the slave.

3) Yes you can. Connect your iPhone to your Mac and copy JSON records via iTunes File Sharing
```

---
## \#519 Posted by: egzplicit Posted at: 2017-11-06T16:24:45.299Z Reads: 135

```
@rpasichnyk thanks for the reply.

It would be great if you can add that export option. One thing to keep in mind is that it will need to render at different resolutions / allow you to select them. Some people shoot 4k, others 2.7k, others 1080p. It's gonna be a great tool to use, thanks for all the work!

1) It's great to hear you already use curves. I just use Samsung 30Q (standard around here I guess). I'm not sure how the curve should look like but isn't 3.2v high for 0%? I think most people use 3 volts as cut off (some even lower like 2.8). 

2) They are CAN connected and master is 0 while slave is 1. I have the BT module connected to the master, could that be the issue? I'll plug it into slave and give it a go. It clearly detects both VESC (both buttons appear inside the app) but when reading from the second vesc (second according to the app) it just fails. Will report back after connecting the module to slave.

3) Oh cool, I forgot about that and never checked. Great!

BT connection works with another app. But when i try to connect with metr it doesnt show me any devices on the Bluetooth connections in the app configuration.

@rpasichnyk perimetr now works but I had to plug the BT module into the slave to be able to change settings on both vescs. Not sure if a bug with the  software but when it was on the master, it could only read/write settings on just one vesc (even if it detected both).

Also, my module seems to disconnect a lot while riding (I have an iPhone 6) and I'm not sure why. Module is connected to FOCBOX and it does the same when on the master or slave. It sits on vibration damping rubber and the UART connection seems solid, but it still disconnects very often (every 1 to 3 minutes or so). Any ideas why? It doesn't seem to disconnect while standing still but i've moved it about and checked all connections and it seems solid, yet I can't get it to stop disconnecting.

It sometimes happens when module (or wires) are too close to phase wires, they create interference. One way to help that is to change layout of wires, move the module away. Another is to change baud rate on the module from 115200 to 9600, but in order to do that you need something like FT232RL (https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=FT232RL)

An Arduino do the job as well, and it's more easier to find one (or a lot :smile: ) lying around.
Do Perimetr check the FW version to authorize connection ?
I mean, if the config structure changes from one version to a new one, you don't want stuff to be messed up by a wrong (de)serialization, right ?

Yes it does a very basic check
```
  function is3x() {
    return major == 3 && minor >= 24;
  }
```
This creates more risk but saves me from constantly updating the app. Fortunately both original and Ackmaniac firmware have same structure in 3.x firmware and I hope it will not be changed :pray:

## \#532 Posted by: Pimousse Posted at: 2017-11-09T15:12:57.450Z Reads: 138

The point is that Vedder is constantly adding new parameters in config struct (see the latest commit of 3.33 few hours ago : https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/commit/5348662197c69a00b7bdea42423674e339db3976).
Now, for instance, app_conf has changed introducing CAN baudrate so it shifts the structure.

So if you serialize/deserialize a new FW with an old structure you may mess stuffs up, right ?

Thanks for the heads up! As far as I can see, that is `app_configuration` structure, I don't use that. I read and write `mc_configuration` only, we are good, no explosions this time :)
VESC is far away from foolproof and it's good to keep your eyes on the changes or ask if not sure!

Another feature you're missing!
Total distance, this would be a counter that doesn't reset when you reset the stats and would be used to keep track of the total distance a board has traveled. It could be manually set or reset (if you change bt module or put it on a new build, for example) but would be independent of the other stats. 

Making your app better one feature at a time!

That's interesting. Do you mean so you can get notified while charging both? If you mean each on it's own then you can change the name and make aliases for each board. I named one on my boards "yung many baby" for fun. Well I guess it really names each module. You can set separate parameters by clicking the blue settings wheel. You have to do it for each module.

@fraannk I agree it makes sense to expand the range of settings that are stored per module. I will fix it!

@caustin it is possible that the problem is not the antenna, but the actual wires between VESC and BT module. @Jinra explains it in post [#333](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/configuration-and-telemetry-for-vesc-ios-android/13483/333) So one way to combat the problem might be to shorten and / or shield the wires.

@squad @Riako Some time ago I changed the baud rate from 115200 to 9600 on the module that I use on my skateboard and it helped, I get less disconnects now. Unfortunately as mentioned before, you need something like FT232RL or Arduino in order to do that. You need to send `AT+BAUD4` command to to the module. I used FT232RL connected to my Mac and run this in the Terminal:

`echo -n -e "AT+BAUD4\r\n" > /dev/cu.usbserial-A50285BI`

You can send your module back and I will do it for you, if you wish. After this don't forget to change baud rate in VESC Tool as well.

@squad

TLDR: I was having bt connection issues from the button on the module getting pressed. I removed it and now the issues are gone. 

---
 I started having issues with the bt connection staying alive when riding around campus. The only difference between there and when I tested at home was the bumpiness of the road. 

After troubleshooting, I realized that the slight flex was pressing the bt module against the side of the enclosure making it disconnect.

I opened it up and noticed that if I press the button on the module it disconnects so I removed it since I wont be messing with the firmware in it. 

No more disconnect issues! You should give this a try, it may be the culprit of your issues too.

Its the reset button. It pegs the reset pin to ground when pressed. You only need it when programming if your device fails to reboot during the process. It's not needed afterwards.

Exactly :one: year ago https://metr.at was launched :cake: :candle: The feedback of the community was fantastic and I am  enjoying this project so much! I got a lot of help, I am really grateful to all of you who supported me with ideas and testing, financially and just with a good word. I prepared a big anniversary update and hope that you like it! It is now live! :fireworks:  Here is what it has:

A couple of small features suggested by forum members. They were easy to implement but are very useful :thumbsup:

:ballot_box_with_check: Add record to favorites so it stays on top of the list (thanks @MontPierre)
:ballot_box_with_check: Add fault code marker for the record (thanks @jmasta)

http://gph.is/2zZDVtc

Keep your ideas coming! They can be small or big, stupid or smart, doesn't matter I like to see them anyway! :heart:

:wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash:

Next the new **Overlay**. Available for Windows and Mac, get it here: https://metr.at/overlay It is very easy to use, you do not need a manual!

http://gph.is/2zYwdPI

Supported features:
:ballot_box_with_check: Variable resolutions (1080p, 4K, etc)
:ballot_box_with_check: Use video from your phone or from action camera
:ballot_box_with_check: Multiple video file import (for example GoPro splits each 4GB)
:ballot_box_with_check: Automatic offset calculation based on video start time
:ballot_box_with_check: Setting start and end time to encode only a part of the video
:ballot_box_with_check: Overlay with video or transparent background for further editing

Right now it has some basic text widgets. I will add more in the future:
:heavy_minus_sign:  gauge (for speed, current and power)
:heavy_minus_sign: map tracker, elevation tracker
:heavy_minus_sign: pre-installed presets
:grey_question:  (tell me what you think is cool)

If you use GoPro I recommend to connect it with usb cable and run GoPro Quick before you start recording videos to sync time. By doing this Overlay will match the offset automatically between the record and the video.

:wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash:

Another big feature is **Modes**. Each mode is a cut-down version of Motor Configuration (it has only limits). When you apply the mode, it will load existing configuration from the VESC, modify the limits, and write it back. Oh, and it will do it for all of your VESCs via CAN :electric_plug:

http://gph.is/2j9ry5G

It is easy to edit the mode, change the name and values :pencil2:

http://gph.is/2j9rJ0Q

You can also share it! :globe_with_meridians:  And just like the records, modes support oneboxing, so when you paste the url https://metr.at/m/3ZaR on the forum, it turns out to this

https://metr.at/m/3ZaR

The QR code is there for a reason, you can scan it with the app to import

http://gph.is/2zXnj56

The limits in Modes are basic, but I will extend them in the future when I figure out a nice way. For example speed limit km/h would be very useful.

:wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash::wavy_dash:

I also added TCP Server to the app. This makes possible to connect with Desktop version of the VESC-Tool over Wi-Fi over BLE to your VESC and do things like read/write motor/app configuration and do motor detection. Realtime data and firmware update did not work well for me unfortunately, because of the speed limit :thunder_cloud_rain:

http://gph.is/2zX9bsA

A new small feature "Multiply Data". It will multiply realtime current and power by the number of VESCs. If you don't like it, you can disable it. I added it since I already had VESC-count detection mechanism over CAN and thought it can be useful. Finally you don't need to explain that you are running dual setup and logging values are only for one VESC ;)

Along the way I squashed :bug: :hammer:   some nasty bugs, for example the one with Record not being stopped after the VESC is powered down (ping @sebaszz). Thanks to @hexakopter for helping out with many things, @egzplicit for overlay suggestions and @i2oadsweepei2 for the crazy iPad layout screenshot (I liked it :joy:). Thanks to everyone who answers in this topic when I don't have time, you are the best!

The journey continues! :rocket:

Hey Roman, some great work! I just tried to test modes but unfortunately they don't seem to work for me, I believe app changes something other than just current limits, I have hall sensors set up in both motors and one has "invert motor direction" enabled in VESC tool, after updating slow mode motors just won't spin, I mean they try to rotate but no success. 

And now another thing, I see Ben released newer VESC tool than v 0.84 on Your github, could You port the newest version too?

BTW. keep us updated how meeting with Benjamin goes ;)

Thank you for reporting the problem! Can you please
1) Apply motor conf that works for you with VESC-Tool and save xml
2) Apply mode, reconnect with VESC-Tool and save another xml
3) Send me both so I can look where it goes wrong
It would be very helpful :slight_smile: 

Yeah I recently visited Benjamin and I am very happy that I got the chance. I can only say that he is definitely the most talented and productive person I have ever met. He is just amazing :blush:

Thank you for the configuration files. After little investigation I must admit that @Pimousse was right and it just happened. I missed one parameter that was added in FW3.31 in Motor Configuration structure. The fix will be easy but for now my recommendation:

If you run FW 3.31 or above, do not use Modes
If you run FW 3.30 or below, you can use Modes

The same applies to Perimetr. Not compatible with 3.31 or above.

Downgrade everyone? :smile:

Done it again, thanks Roman, i still haven't tested since App store takes a while to distribute to all servers, loved the multiply data, and was waiting for it. The TCP Server will be great to who keep changing settings all the time (I guess everyone) and is tired of removing a lot of enclosure screws each time

But since you said to keep suggestions coming here we go:

-On the records screen and right beside the clock or somewhere Wh/km or Wh/mi depending on the unit settings

-The modes just took the app to another level, the only thing missing is to also include ERPM limits to limit speed, my little cousin loves my e-skate, but no way i'm letting her ride if the board can get to 30 km/h or so, even if that takes a long time at a low current and wattage limit. I do'nt if it's a whole other parameter set that has to be included, but if i remember correct it's all the sema string on the fw

@Pedrodemio thank you for suggestions! I really want to add speed limit to Modes, but ERPM is too unintuitive, I want to replace it with km/h. But this requires the poles and pulley and wheel diameter to be setup correctly by the user.

@squad The updated version is already out (and Perimetr too), App Store Review was surprisingly  quick. Now everyone should be able to use any firmware version.

Great update, really nice work! Makes me even more happy I got your module and I‚Äôm using your tools.

You forgot to mention one small update: iPhone X support :wink:

I think I found an issue/bug in the modes. With @Ackmaniac 3.100 firmware when I tap the ‚ÄúRead‚Äù button, the Maximum Braking Wattage value is wrong. I have them at 15000/-15000 but this is what the app is showing:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/8/78363d62ca43576b675fd290721dc0be495f02e7.jpg" width="230" height="500">

The TCP server is also great. I assume it is not possible to connect to the master VESC if BT module is connected to slave?

In terms of suggestions, having temperature and speed not tied to metric/imperial would be nice... I‚Äôm used to celsius but speed in miles.

Thanks again for the update.

Updates are fantastic (module and app in general, I'm a huge advocate/fan).  Modes feature was enough to convince me to upgrade my firmware which has never been done by me so had to compile a bunch of bits before doing the upgrade but 99.999% working.  I seem to have an issue where the distance is coming up 0 but think it's to do with my phone GPS or something will try without GPS distance tracking and see if it tracks the miles, seems if my Nexus 5X is asleep in my pocket it doesn't give the GPS location updates or something.

Try to dismiss the app, hit the show recent apps button then swipe away the metr app.  Turn off and power up your board so the bluetooth resets too on there then try to launch the metr app again, sometimes it can be a little touchy but I'm sure that process works I just did it here, unfortunately no Pixel 2XL to test on but willing to accept test devices :)

If it still fails I'd try to hit the show logs button in the app and maybe post the log here as an attachment if possible (or linked from a sharing site like drive or dropbox).  Might need logcat hooked up to a device to get all the details but never hurts to check the logs.

Could be but think that newer bluetooth version are typically backwards compatible so any 4.0 hardware shouldn't have any problem talking to 2.0 or 3.0 devices, could be something else with the OS or hardware though (I'm on 8.0.0 here on a nexus 5x so think the software is the same as the pixel right now but not entirely sure).

Tried it out here for a bit and seems to have fixed the general distance issue.  I still have problems with it tracking when I tell it to prefer the GPS data, it seems to only track parts of the trip, but might be something with my developer settings closing apps in the background.

First one here I didn't have prefer GPS on

https://metr.at/r/hmtOO

(google maps shows this as a 1.3 mile ride as well)


Second one I had the GPS preferred on 

https://metr.at/r/I8ZHd

Believe this had to be closer to .6 miles or more since I did the quick test run I usually do then went around a few more blocks (also Wh vs distance wise seems like the distance isn't making sense on this one).  Not a huge deal or anything but open to tips.

I have been loving all the data metr has been giving me about my board. Thanks for all your updates!

Yesterday I went for a ride but was shocked when I saw the scale of some of the data. I didn't get any warnings or faults durning the ride so I decided it was a glitch and didn't think much of it. Today I went to use my board and am getting constant over current faults causing the FOCBOX to reset after the motor barely twitches (aka unusable).

Do you feel there could be any correlation to the weird data and my ESC being fussy? I have done over 200 miles on this setup and it has been super stable. I'm going to dig a little deeper after work but appreciate any thoughts.

My setup:
FOCBOX
12s 5,00mAh LiPo with SuPower BMS

We mostly use eboards for commuting and records back and forth create a lot of them and when you wan‚Äôt to find a specific ride it‚Äôs not easy when you record a lot. 
- create files to separate the type of rides : commute , fun ride 

And for the commute record i would like a feature to ¬´ consolidate ¬ª two record like one since it‚Äôs basically the same ride, just a few hours later when you have to go home.  
What do you think ?

Just got off a screen share with Enertion support and they will be sending me a new FOCBOX. I had fortunately purchased the warranty as I have had bad luck with first tries with new hardware. So no new info/conclusion, but am itching to get back on my board.

metr has been great though this process. thanks!

I feel like the maximum RPM is off. Supposed to be 190kv motors on 12s limited to 60k ERPM.  Anyone have thoughts.  Everything else is pretty close since I compared metr stats to a separate wattmeter.

So 190kv * 45.7v * 7 pole pairs = 60,781.  So the motors may be slightly less than 190kv which is fine but it's not close to the max RPM of 49k by metr stats.

Edit......  So I think it's less the metr and more like witchcraft.  
i plugged my numbers into this skate calculator.  Changed motor efficiency to 83% which mirrors my top speed and I get the same 49k loaded RPM as metr shows.  Why does it go to 49k and not 60k.  I'll tell you.  Witchcrafts. Pure witchcrafts.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/5/452d7d30f570e67e9642b38421feee997e597c43.PNG" width="281" height="500">

This is the theoretical maximum rpm, you probably never gonna get it in real life, one of the factor is as you said the motor Kv may be slight of, you can measure it by using the terminal os VESC tool

Second is duty cycle, the VESC works by default at a maximum of 95%, so you max theoretical ERPM is 0,96 what you calculated

And last, is you are running FOC you tend to loose a little bit of top speed

So unless I took this board downhill faster than the theoretical max top speed, I'll never reach the 60k ERPM with my current setup due to all the loses combined, duty cycle, friction, heat, and of course witchcraft. I just think it's weird it just peaks at 36mph. Once it's there amp draw isn't even that high. It just cruises

```
So after time spent on the forum researching motor kV ratings paired with cell count it seems like most people say for 12s 190kv is the max. Because of you do the math you get 60k unloaded ERPM roughly.  So why this magic number of it doesn't even apply.  Vedder says 8600 motor rpms is the efficient zone of the motor but you can't reach it if you use 190kv on 12s as it sits at theoretical max not loaded max.   
With that said and nothing changed other than motor kV increased to 240kv the loaded ERPM becomes ~ 60k and motor rpms to 8600.  I get higher kV speed goes up and torque down so there is for sure a difference, including new factors for drag and motor efficiency but it seems like exceeding the theoretical max to reach the loaded max would be fine. At a minimum to reach the motors full potential.

```
People run 12S on 190kV, but really that is too high for Vedder's recommendations.   If your voltage is greater than ~45V, you will be over 60k ERPM.  On a fully charged battery you can easily go over 60k even after accounting for voltage sag.  170kV is much better for 12S.   Keep in mind that 60k ERPM is not a hard limit but more of a guideline.  People have taken Vedder's suggestion of keeping it under 60k and made it a hard and fast "rule"

That said.. Not to be rude, but this thread is about **Metr**.  Your discussion would be better off in its own thread...

@rpasichnyk 

I am upgrading to VESC Tool, but I can't remember if we still need custom firmware (3.xx) to configure the VESC with Perimetr or to use the new "Modes" feature in Metr?  Or does it work natively with Vedder's new 3.xx firmware?  

Also, does the modes feature work with Ackmaniac's modified firmware?

No need to use custom, please use official Vedder firmware. Both Modes and Perimetr work fine with original firmware starting from v3.29. You can also use Ackmaniac's, but his implementation of Watt control is separate and does not use limits set by the VESC Tool. So this will not work.

Latest update adds Celsius for temperature while keeping the speed in miles per hour (if you select Imperial). Thanks @rpasichnyk for this! 

Bug list time:

* There is a spelling mistake, it's saying "Celcius" and not "Celsius".

* In the new Modes mode I've noticed it does something weird to my settings. Watt control values (maximum/min) gets reset every time you write a new mode. I'm sure these did not get mangled in the previous version because i used that version to change motor min/max and it never changed other values... but now every time I write a new mode, maximum wattage remains 15000 but maximum braking wattage gets changed to 0.0W.

* I'm not sure about this but I've noticed that after writing a new mode, my motors don't both start at the same time (looks like the hall sensors values are skew?) What happens is that I write a new mode, turn the board upside down and slowly pushing the trigger will cause one wheel to spin but not the other. Even full throttle won't cause the other to spin, sometimes. However, if I redo motor detection and never write a new mode, it never does that. So it looks like something changes while it shouldn't change when writing a new mode? (this is FOCBOX dual on FOC with hall sensors)

A quick list of other possible improvements: 

1) Send record by email. I know you can connect your phone to iTunes and download the files, but it's much more convenient if you can send the telemetry file with the built in email client to yourself or somebody else.

2) I calculate the efficiency in Wh per mile very often and was wondering if a new widget can be added on the main screen to do that...the calculation ofc is simple, total Wh used / distance... but it would be nice to have a widget that shows efficiency in Wh per mile/km.

3) The stats shown when you tap the bottom bluetooth status widget shows your overall total distance/wh/etc. If would be nice to have another section underneath that shows the same but only for the last ride. So even if you don't record a session, you would see the overall totals but also the stats for the last ride. I think temporary BT disconnects need to be taken into account here... if it's a short one it should not reset the last trip stats. If the app was disconnected for a longer time, it should consider it as a new trip.

As always, big thank you for the app, it's really useful (and a big thank you for the TCP Bridge, really helpful)!

You are like a rocket :rocket:  100 kph :laughing: Let's double check if your motor pole / pulley / wheel diameter settings are correct. Actually your settings might be somewhat gone, so definitely double check them!

That is possible because I changed how "overrides" work. Now if you have multiple boards, you can make more parameters specific to every board (ping @Silverline) but the old overrides might have corrupted a little bit with the update.

... high-five on turning off "Prefer GPS" ;) Now your speed data is more precise (hopefully after we fix the issue with settings)

@rpasichnyk thanks for the update to fix modes in 3.100. I found a few bugs:

1) real time tab working, tap modes and enter a mode and click read
2) settings are read correctly
3) click close and go back to realtime 
4) values are frozen while the connection to the BT module remains green
5) kill the app and restart, real time works again BUT settings read in step 1) in the mode are not saved 


Also:

1) app connects, detects dual vescs, real time values work
2) click scan and connect again to the BT module
3) real time tab now reports 3 vescs 
4) repeat step 2 and now go back to real time, shows quad vescs

Thanks again for all the hard work and bug fixing :slight_smile:

Edited: this is on iPhone X with dual focbox running 3.100

@squad no, stats are always on and always updating, even if no record is happening. Stats are pretty limited at the moment, but I remember some good suggestions in this topic, like all time stats, last ride stats, etc. Another thing it would be cool to store them on the VESC (I talked to Benjamin and maybe he will add a command to store custom user data at some point)

Could it be that the app is killed in the background and before it dies it doesn‚Äôt save the stats? Looks a lot like it‚Äôs that, quit the app and within a few days it will be killed and stats are lost.

Thanks Roman - that trick sparked it into life
So only two parameters can be displayed on the watch ?

Also - my distance  parameters now has two values - one 1345 and one 3.86km. Presumably the larger no is a total distance until a reset and the smaller no is last trip? . So how do you reset the large no? . Turning off power to vesc doesn't reset it and it doesn't reset through Reset Settings in Settings Tab?

I think I have the same problem. My first thought is that it is firmware 2.18 related. When I turn on the board and open the app, it starts counting up VESC everytime it updates. So every 0.3 seconds it adds a VESC, which means that I after some time will have 1000 VESCs or even more. When multiply data then is on, it multiplies e.g. the current amps with the VESC count, and that's why it goes crazy. Check my video: 

https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1J273t0k2p2Q0f2H2O1i/ScreenRecording_01-09-2018%2018-50-25.MP4

The multiplying of the data happens (as intended) only when the setting is on. But the number-of-VESCs-count keeps rising regardless of my settings. Is this something that can be fixed, since I'm not planning to update my VESC firmware right now @rpasichnyk? :) Maybe the user should set the number of VESC's instead of it detecting it automatically. Or maybe I should just get to it and update my VESCs...

Thanks!

No... You need to kill the app in your recents.

We all experience this...because hm-10 are setup as slaves, meaning they only accept one connection. You have to kill the connection. If metr.at is in your recent app list, swipe it away to completely kill it. This will kill the connection and the module will blink red again waiting to be connected to.

This isn't an Android bug,it's a limitation of the hm10 being in slave mode,and also the fact that it's a BLE device and doesn't show in Android Bluetooth device list. 

-you turn on and off Bluetooth but app is still running in background so it reconnects.
-you can't manually disconnect because the module doesn't show in the Android device list because it's BLE
-you exit metr.at by the home button or back button. Guess what metr is still running. Hit your recent apps and swipe it away. Guarantee you the module will blink because killing the app kills the BLE connection.

I did, i also tried turning the phone on and off, i have it set to automaticly close every background app and i have a ble app thats able to read devices none of my other apps could read my metr module.

I had to turn off the board and on again and it could, then i could go into metr and bum same problem it was "locked" to the app in that way that i had to reset the module before it would work.

The module can't get "locked" 

The only way it's locked is if a valid serial connection is open with valid packets. Which means the app is still running. Otherwise the HM10 would close the connection on it's own...

You have a red LED on the module. If the LED is blinking, it means there is no connection. If the LED is always ON and not blinking, it means there is an active connection. Try to see what happens when you force close the app. Does it start blinking?

Did you get the time to look at the odometer bug? Mine randomly resets to 0 and it looks like it‚Äôs doing it long after a ride when the app is killed in the background (by iOS not the user).

Also maybe a new feature: it would be really nice to start/stop recordings from the Apple Watch (hard / force touch would show the buttons , then start/pause/stop). ‚ÄúRide‚Äù app does this and it‚Äôs really helpful.

[quote="fraannk, post:664, topic:13483"]
I think I have the same problem. My first thought is that it is firmware 2.18 related. When I turn on the board and open the app, it starts counting up VESC everytime it updates. So every 0.3 seconds it adds a VESC, which means that I after some time will have 1000 VESCs or even more. When multiply data then is on, it multiplies e.g. the current amps with the VESC count, and that‚Äôs why it goes crazy.
[/quote]

Mine does that too.  I'm also still on 2.18 firmware.  I was going to post about it, but forgot since it doesn't seem to affect the data (as long as 'Multiply Data' is off)

Or maybe it's because I am running 1,329 VESCs on my board.  One of the two ;)

Thanks. About the bug with the all time stats, seems to still be present. U can reproduce it by doing a ride and killing the app: the numbers will go down to 0. If you don‚Äôt kill the app and leave it in the background for a long time, iOS will stop it eventually and all stats still reset for me (iPhone X, 11.2.1).

Also Consumption seems weird:

![image|230x500](upload://v450y82owaAMB3cZWMi4Nr5b0nN.jpg)

1.5 miles, 32Wh total. That‚Äôs 21.3Wh per mile yet the app is saying 8Wh per mile.

Hi @rpasichnyk, 
It seems that I have the same issue as @Riako, I have very few values recorded, the module disconnects quiet often (and doesn't reconnect).
It's basically the same setup (dual VESC 6 nRF via can-bus, 115200 bauds).
I may try to lower the baudrate but not sure that it helps because the module itself is not visible by the phone (iPhone 5, iOS 10.3.3).
So, I'm wondering if the 2.4Ghz microwave blockparty in my electronics box doesn't mess it up (nRF x2 + GT2b Rx + your BT module).
Any other hints that may help to troubleshoot ?
I'll give my second metr.at module a try.

Here is the log :

I checked the firmware and the datasheet of the nRF chip embedded on both VESC 6.

That the only thing I can try after the reset button. :confused:

@egzplicit Thank you for reporting, I have an idea why the bug is happening. My app saves the stats on destruction, but I receive this event only if the app is not frozen. iOS freezes apps after a while when you move them to background. The app however does not get frozen if it maintains active BLE connection. So the trick with force closing has to be done after powering down the module, moving the app into background and waiting for some time. I could finally reliably reproduce this. Fix coming soon.

Little embarrassing with miles, I multiplied the value by 0.62 instead of dividing by 0.62. Thanks for heads up. 8 / 0.62 / 0.62 is about 21 :blush: Will correct that as well!

@Pimousse This is very strange with the module not reconnecting. Does it start blinking when the connection is broken?

I don't remeber seen it blinding I guess.
I will try again with Ack apps but with your module this time, cause with a standard  2‚Ç¨ BT and ackmaniac like I did before there is no pb at all.

Yup there is a "TCP Bridge" button you hit that and it pops up a dialog with your IP/port it opened on your phone then on your computer you use connect using the TCP/IP tab in the vesc_tool, from there can do everything as though you are hooked up through USB.  There is some delay in the data going through your network and then over bluetooth but it's not bad for regular config stuff, I tried flashing the firmware over it and it takes incredibly long though so would recommend against trying that.

And not sure, when i used BLDC with the newest firmware i didnt have an output, swapped over to vesc project (Also 10 times better) i was able to see my speed wh so on.

Yeah i think i will start with that =)

Need to read up some more before i have the guts to update the firmware... with all these horror storys of vesc going bad when updating.
One of the vesc is a maytech i belive so i dont know if it has bootloader installed..

The feature to have the ability to switch modes seems awesome since im not able to via the remote. 

Beginner mode  (25km/h)
Commuting mode  (32km/h)
Beast mode  (40km/h)

This would be so sweet!

This forum never disappoints, amazed of the support people are willing to give to us beginners :slight_smile:

Im using the raptor 1 style remote, there is no switch for diffrent speed modes. 

But changing the modes via  the app seems very nice!
Dont want to hassle with installing bootloader so i will probably get another vesc in the future that has it installed and use the maytech on another build. 

One thing i also would like to have on the app is a box  "estimated range left" 
Other that that the app have all the values i could ever want :)

Hi Roman,

I finally found spare time to test my custom firmware in order to fix BLE dropouts.

BEFORE (official 3.34) :

https://metr.at/r/0IOt2

AFTER (custom 3.35) :

https://metr.at/r/VRDYd

So, my conclusion is... 

**IT WORKS !**
-

I didn't change anything on my setup beside the FW upload on both VESCs.
To be confirmed by @Riako but I still can't build windows version of VESC Tool.
The built .exe file asks for several QTxxx.dll.
I trying to figure out how to embed them. :slight_smile:

This is amazing, thank you for investigating! Very interesting stuff... I guess it will be useful for all who VESC6 + BLE. I just tried to build VESC Tool on Windows, here's how, maybe you will find what you missed:

Installed Qt mingw variant

![qt|690x340](upload://a5fHTz7ZfAtMchUbXY3yN34E0Ba.png)

Opened Qt Creator and built Release configuration

![28|63x121](upload://6PAGzHvT1HISYrzJ8VeP3lskAWy.png)

Found resulting binary `vesc_tool_0.87.exe` and copied it to a new folder, navigated to that folder using mingw terminal and run

`/c/Qt/5.10.1/mingw53_32/bin/windeployqt.exe vesc_tool_0.87.exe --release`
`cp /c/Qt/Tools/mingw530_32/bin/libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll .`
`cp /c/Qt/Tools/mingw530_32/bin/libwinpthread-1.dll .`
`cp /c/Qt/Tools/mingw530_32/bin/libstdc++-6.dll .`

Verified that I can run `vesc_tool_0.87.exe` from there
Zipped the folder

Hope this helps :slight_smile:

@Pedrodemio No, I don't subtract the regen amount. My first thought those are two different things and you can not say you have less consumption just because you use regen. But after more thinking I am not sure, I guess you can say that :thinking:

@ElskerShadow maybe because you have 2 VESCs and they are not connected via CAN? Then you get half the consumption, just for 1 VESC.

There is a bug in the data, if you look at https://metr.at/r/VRDYd?format=json and search for `elapsedWh`, it starts growing slowly until `117.26`, then goes crazy `117.26,117.26,175.87,234.49,234.49`. Looking at `elapsed` milliseconds that corresponds to 732603 which is about 12-13 minutes from the start. Some bug occurred. You can see that if you zoom your chart before that time, you will get proper consumption https://metr.at/r/VRDYd?zoom_start=20&zoom_end=2032. Would be nice to figure out what happened, maybe VESC went off/on for a short time, I need to test that case.

Not a good thing if it's really the case ! :worried:

The jump on this value appeared during a break (just put the board in a corner without switching it off) so I don't see any event that could have trigger a bug...

So the bug would be in the VESC FW ?

I guess it makes more sense to subtract than to not to, of course not all regen energy goes back to the battery due to losses in wiring and internal resistance, but I believe the most part goes back, if I got time I will do two full discharge rides, one using the brake and other without or use it only if really needed, this way if both rides gets the same energy out of the battery we will know if it‚Äôs almost 100% regen efficiency 

About the wrong values, the two rides that I did I got arround 7,9 Wh/km, seems reasonable, next ride I will connect both VESC‚Äôs and see if adds up

Check the realtime value directly in BLC/VESC Tool. 
If the value is the same, it's probably a fried resistor.
Check also if the other VESC is showing the same value (could be checked through metr.at with CAN fwd, I guess).

Ohh... Any reasen why you choose to do the title thing on top of each other ? It's pain in the as, and gets pretty confusing when i want to re-do the realtime info/layout screen. Why not at simple drop down list, to chose the prefered info/layout from ?

Just choose the info you want to se, from a simple list, and then arrange the titles afterwards the way you want it to look ?

It's a good idea :) I will think about it!

I don't recommend flashing firmware via TCP Bridge because it takes way to long. Actually if you have enough patience it may work, but I don't know for sure. I guess it doesn't hurt to try, because firmware is protected by checksum (crc16) and if some bytes are corrupted during transfer, VESC will just ignore it.

I completed a small project recently, I managed to convert metr records to format understandable by Garmin VIRB Edit. It is very powerful and easy to use software for telemetry overlay. Really looking forward for someone giving it a try, please do, instructions are available at metr.at/overlay

FWIW, you won't get the Pixel to connect if it's running Oreo (Android 8.0) due to the strict requirements that Android put into place in the latest version.

@Bjork3n I will add Watt meter to the Realtime screen soon, thank you for the suggestion! Yes, you can use mode feature with Ackmaniacs FW.

@zyphaz Unfortunately it is not possible to display Voltage / Current values in VIRB Edit. I wanted that too. Neither VIRB nor file format used for telemetry (https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit)  support this. Hope Garmin will add it in the future, as electric bikes and motorbikes get more and more popular. At least we have Power (Watts) now :wink:

@mmaner the LED on the module is blinking when powered on. After you press Scan in the app, the LED should stop blinking and keep always ON. Does it happen?

iPhone 5 (2012) is 32bit device. Since 5S (2013) apps could run in 64 or 32bits. I believe that since iOS11Apple completely dropped support for 32bit apps what probably reflected on devs not being able to compile new version of their software in 32 bits.

@rpasichnyk Thanks for the clarification re: available metrics.  

Regarding the Overlay speedos, which speed should I be selecting?  I tried Recorded Speed , Recorded 2D/3D, Calculated, Calculated 2D/3D and all of them showed only a max of 6MPH.  As seen in the screenshot above, Metr recorded anywhere up to 44KPH.  

I can send the *.fit file if you want to take a deeper look, but I don't want to post it here since it has GPS data near my home (I now see in the options I can exclude the map data by the way, thanks for that).

The only thing that I didn‚Äôt like is the gradient display, since it‚Äôs based on GPS it‚Äôs not precise and nowhere near what‚Äôs the road really is, but the only way would be accessing the accelerometer on the VESC to correct it

@rpasichnyk on the web view, would be possible to split the current and motor current average values ins two, being one for positive current and another for negative? This way the data would be way more useful, currently since the average consider negative values and average all together 

Another alternative would be to make this averages absolutes, with negative values being used in absolute value

I have an issue with the metr app..
It seems that if it not used for a while it disconnects/shutsdown and deletes the recording that's been started.

Tried to log my rides serveral times but when I grab the phone from my pocket and opens the METR app it says "disconnected" but reconnect like 1 sec after. 

The recoding that I started in the beginning of the ride was lost.

Is  there any way to keep the METR connected constantly to log the full ride? 
Was quite disappointed the other day when I watched my phone after the ride and noticed that there was no recording saved...Board had been on the hole time.

@Yecrtz there are 2 cells on the realtime screen that can show speed (the GPS one has another icon), can you please make sure you see the right one? If not check that you allow Location android permission for metr app. Toggle 'Use Location' off and on.
@ElskerShadow where did you get your 3.35 from? It should work.
@Bjork3n check if you have 'Automatic records' enabled. In this case, increase 'Stop delay' or disable 'Automatic records' alltogether. This way the record will not stop after disconnect.
@RyuX Perimetr is not working with 3.100 atm. Will add basic support for it soon. With metr app you can use modes, but as you pointed out, it doesn't get saved after power down. I will look into it!
@mmaner I am also very interested to know about the screwup.

Thanks for the reply.

I tried Modes with the Metr App and the ackmaniac firmware.. and indeed it kinda screwed everything up. I ended up re-flashing the firmware and setting all the parameters again until my VESC started working again - but granted that might just be because you don't support the firmware yet (neither in perimetr or metr).

But looking forward on the support.
I am very happy with the bluetooth module.

I don't use auto record so that's not the issue. 
I'm starting the recording and put my phone in the pocket, when I arrive on my destination I take up the phone and check the app. It displays disconnected on the real-time tab but reconnects a sec later. 
If I then check records there is nothing, no sign of any recording. 
It's almost like the app goes to sleep when not used in your hand.

Thank you, I found what was the problem in the log. You accidentally closed the app by pressing Back button, that's why there is no record. If you pressed Home button instead, the app would be minimized and keep running in the background. But this is not obvious and I changed the default behavior of the Back button which will now (v2.2.24) work the same way (minimize instead of close).

I installed 3.100 today and went for a ride. I had my record randomly stopped after about 7 minutes several times. I have 'Automatic records' enabled and notifications, so I can hear when notification pops up. I pulled my phone and saw a weird thing, the VESC didn't send back any packets (the green status dot was not blinking). Then after 1 minute it started blinking again. I suspect something is wrong with 3.100, because this never happened to me with 3.3x that I had before... Anyone with 3.100 here with similar problems?

Also good news, Perimetr now supports FW 3.100 and FOC Hall Sensors detection :rocket:

Hello

I have two of your bluetooths and will begin my build very soon.

This thread is very long but I checked the OP and I do not see watt control option. I assume you do not have that feature? Asking as Ackmaniac esc tool has that option.

If not, then is there any plan to implement one?

'End of charge voltage' is just for telling when your battery is sufficiently charged. Having it 30v for 10s sounds wrong. You need to set it to 41.5 or something. In the latest version I fixed the bug that you can sometimes have this notification when braking (and voltage spikes up). Now you should get it only while charging.

@Brad check Modes tab, you can set Watts there. New Ackmaniac's firmware uses current control as I remember correctly (which works the same as watt control in his old BLDC-Tool mod)

Since the CAN topic was mentioned, I also have a weird behavior, don't know if it's on the app side or the VESC firmware. Two cases I gave problems

1- The most important, TCP bridge

My metr is plugged on the slave VESC, configuring it works flawless, also real time control with the keyboard, but if I use CAN forward on VESC tool to configure and control the master, its gets more and more delay between a command being sent and that command being executed, be it controlling with the keyboard or writing/reading configuration, if I reset the board it comes back to normal, but after a few minutes become unusable again 

2 - Using CAN forward on the app

I guess the same delay start to happen and the data starts to lag, also changing settings on the master VESC can't be completed successful if the board has been on for a few minutes, so I always reset before changing modes and record from the slave VESC

@rpasichnyk I think I found another bug or something like that, look at this record

https://metr.at/r/zOR0r?zoom_start=0&zoom_end=8416

You can see by the GPS data that on 17:31:27 I stopped and at 17:33:00 started moving again (Watching a nice sunset), but if you look at the current data it's all zero long before I start moving again

Same goes for the top speed of 40 km/h, that according to GPS occurred while I'm stopped lol!

It appears that the GPS data and Bluetooth data are out of sync, I will look at older records to see if happening in other occasions, this is my first ride after the last update

Cheers

Hi @rpasichnyk, a quick question I hope you will try help me with. :) I've been using your module for more than a year with my iPhone - works perfectly! :) Now I have bought a Kingwear 88 watch that runs a full Android 5.1 and tries to connect to the module. It does find it and connect, but it keeps disconnecting and reconnecting in an endless cycle. Do you have any idea why that may be? To be honest I have absolutely NO android knowledge, so if it's some kind of basic setting I should change, I'd love to try it out! :) Thanks

@rpasichnyk @Pedrodemio
Negative duty cycle can happen if you move the board backwards. Like if you're standing and moving the board back and forth under your feet. I do it all the time which is how I know lol. You were probably doing something similar.

E: it doesn't mean the command is negative, but the feedback is.

You could add throttle position to the record and that would tell you the difference between command and actual. Could also be useful for throttle tuning.

Hi there, couple of questions if I may

Is there any way to see lifetime stats for a board with the board disconnected? I can only find them when I click on the name of the BT module when its connected.

I have a strange issue with the modes.  I read my current settings (from when I did setup with USB cable and VESC tool) and then made that into my ‚Äúnormal mode‚Äù without changing anything. I then did the same so I could overwrite data for slow mode but then tuned batt max and motor max down but when I accelerate it makes the board go into reverse only?

@Klattrup ha-ha, I have never seen smart watches with full Android before. I am surprised you even managed to make connection with the module. This means that you could open Metr app, navigate to Settings and press Scan. How is that even possible on that tiny screen?

@PXSS thank you for enlightening me about negative duty cycle :slight_smile:

@Pedrodemio do you still have the issue? Do you remember, was it a cloudy weather? My app records GPS position only if accuracy is within 30 meters, which is not always the case when you bad GPS signal.

@BigBrit You should be able to see the stats even if the board disconnected. Just click on the red disconnected icon and then you can see your stats. Maybe you didn't notice 2 tabs on the top: "Today" and "All Time", you can switch between them. Can you repeat what you did with modes and see if you still have the issue, then go to metr - Settings - Show Logs and send me the text file? I will try to help you.

I just tried clearing all application cache on the watch, removed all known wifi points and removed all known BT devices.

I hope to try it out on the road tonight, I'll report back here for those interested.

Oh and the watch is dirt cheap for what it's capable of! Just saying ;)

Edit: The damn thing did not work! :disappointed_relieved: It looked so promising but disconnected on my run all the time. I‚Äôll try moving the module further away from the VESCs and see if that helps. Damn I was disappointet :frowning:

@rpasichnyk  I tried to set up a module today. I have some problems enabling CAN Fwd. When I do that and leave the CAN Id at 0 it won't show realtime data or record. If I change 0 to 1 it shows data and records. But when I set up the CAN BUS i vesc tool the master was 0 and the slave was 1. 
Can you tell me how this works? What vesc does it communicate with when CAN Id is set to 1? and wouldn't we want to communicate with the master, or does that not matter? 

I run a dual set up, focboxes, and the latest firmware from vesc tool 3.38. ![IMG_6733|281x500](upload://dhXNCgdPPi54s2yObypm1sVhWqW.jpg)

Check on booth VESC if the CAN settings are at the same rate, CAN status and CAN baud rate, for a reason I can‚Äôt explain my master VESC was 200 Hz after a firmware update (ignore the False ‚ÄúSend CAN status‚Äù on the picture, it should be true)

I can understand your confusion, you thought that you can set CAN Fwd to 0 or 1 and that will work both ways. But it's not very simple. Suppose you have

VESC ID 0
VESC ID 1

When you enable CAN Fwd checkbox, it adds CAN_FWD header to the packet with specified ID. The problem is that VESC does not check if ID being sent is the same as it has right now. So if you connect wires to VESC 0 and try to enable CAN Fwd 0, it will not work. Firmware will try to send the packet further, but will not be able to find any more VESCs with ID 0 and give up. Same if you connect to VESC 1 and set CAN Fwd to 1. No reply.

This might sound silly, but this is how I recommend to do things for dual VESC setup:

1) LEAVE EVERYTHING BY DEFAULT
2) Do not change VESC ID
3) Both VESCs should have ID set to 0

In the metr app, disable CAN Fwd checkbox. If you for some reason want the data from another VESC, enable the checkbox and leave CAN ID as 0.

It looks confusing, but it works.

[/quote]

I used the vizard to set it up and didn‚Äôt change anything. But when it sets up, it set one vesc to 0 and the other to 1. Should I change that? 

Bottom line‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt actually have to have the CAN fwd enabled to make the metr module and app work properly? I can just leave it unchecked and be happy? The CAN fwd fearture in metr is only there if I for some reason wants to choose which vesc I want the data from? 

And I should enable ‚Äúmultiply data‚Äù, now that I run a dual set up right to get a correct number, right?

Whitch vesc is the Module connected to?

If it is the Slave, then Can-Fw to -> 0
If it is the Master then Can-Fw to -> 1

All this is more usefull with the Perimetr app. 

And Yes, on Dual better Multiply

@rpasichnyk : Few experiment feedbacks (for science)
I spent the whole evening yesterday playing with bluetooth modules (how cool is my life... :smile: ).
I did updated your module firmware with official one (from JNHuaMao, with bootloader).
Same for another HM10.
The good point is that both are now detected by Android 8 (as expected), but none can connect to VESC anymore (iPhone and Android, through your app and @emmaanuel ones),
So it's on UART side I guess, because of back to factory settings.

Would you mind telling me the UART comm. parameters you set through AT commands to properly have them working ?
Thanks mate !

I understand your confusion. There is clearly stated that "you can enable this setting and specify ID of the ESC to communicate with". If your master is 0 and your metr module is connected to 0 as it probably should be you want it to communicate with 1. Why though when you just set the opposite in vesc tool according to the [link](http://www.lp-electronic.com/vesc/connect-two-vesc-via-can-bus/) I posted which works? So the question for @rpasichnyk here would be: why would I want to have an option in metr app to choose CAN Forwarding, even though it is advised to disable it on master vesc? Is it for scenario when I have metr module connected to slave vesc? Will it even work in this scenario?

Try to send `AT+HELP\r\n` to see the list of commands, then `AT+BAUD` to check what baud rate it has. Or try changing VESC baud rate to 9600 and test with @emmaanuel app?

@davidbonde If your both VESCs have ID 0, then it doesn't matter which one you connect the module to, that's why I recommend that. Leave CAN Fwd disabled and Multiply enabled

Hi guys, 
Some possible reasons:
1. Your point : UART params are not equal between VESC and your BT module. I can't give you my default params, because I don't have a board available.
2. On the BT communication, there is one parameter witch can influence the good working of the app is the Characteristicwritetype, with can be "with" or "without" response. Usually the app read this setting for the BT Module.
3. Another idea, is a timeout problem, for exemple if your module as become slower than before. You can have a look at the debug logs of the app, maybe you'll see something interesting. 
4. Try to use https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/hm10-bluetooth-serial-lite/id1030454675?mt=8 to debug your connection problem.

Correct. Since it is actually not Google's fault as I understand. Android is just following the Bluetooth rules more strictly as it is supposed to.
A bit weird that the modules are faulty though.

So replacing the module with one that follows the rules as intended might be the only way to go. Or if it is possible to update the firmware of the module using an Arduino or something would be great as well

@Ingvarjedi most likely your VESC reports incorrect voltage. Try another VESC?
@Dmaxx can you double check that your baudrate is 115200, not 11250 (happened to me once), UART is enabled, power cycle VESC, try again. Also try with 9600 baudrate.

No, "multiply data" does nothing when CAN is not connected. For how long have you been having these issues? This looks superbad... What happens if you force close the app, power down the VESC, turn back on everything, and just spin the motors on the bench while looking at the current and speed, do you have these weird values again? About speed, and the map.. looks like you have 2 GPS points total. Bad weather today? Do you have "Prefer GPS"? Turn that off.

The duty cycle looks kind of OK. If you turn off "Prefer GPS", the speed will closely relate to duty cycle. But the currents are crazy, and I think this is just some problem with VESC reporting inadequate values. Try on the bench. If it still looks wrong, try with USB cable and check VESC Tool realtime data. I am pretty sure you will see same artifacts.

@Silverline @Yecrtz I think I fixed background location problem, but I don‚Äôt have Oreo for test until next week. I pushed an updated version 2.2.58, give it a try, there is a small chance the problem is fixed now.

Looks similar what @Silverline had, but more extreme. Can you send me log file rpasichnyk@icloud.com? Ah, but it was 2 days ago, so in order to fetch the log file, you need to connect your iPhone to Mac, run iTunes Connect and open Apps -> File Sharing. Because the log you get in the app resets every day.

Actually I have an idea what might be happening. Bear with me.

Still lots of instability on Android Oreo with latest update. App crashed 4 times during my ride yesterday. Eventually android changed the message 'metr stopped working' into 'metr keeps stopping working'. Never seen that happen. Lost data every time.

Hi, a bit out of topic but I got a Question.

I will be using the Nyko Kama Controller as a Remote, wil i be able to still use the bluetooth module or do they share the same Header on the board ? 

Sorry if this question already fell here I couldnt find it^^

UART or PPM? If PPM no problem, if UART then they share same port and you could use dual VESCs connected with CAN. One for telemetry, second for remote.

The Nyko Kama is not using PPM so I think it must be using UART then ?! :smiley:

 I am running a single Motor Setup and wont invest into a dual setup in near Futur.
(Im 17 year old working for my Money^^) 

So there is no way to use both ?

No that I know of. You could always go this low cost way:

It's PPM and reliable but trigger style and not pretty. Keep in mind that **"Two products are sold separately"**.

Hey @rpasichnyk last update fix the multi vescs detection but it looks like the whole app is now freaking out, doing many updates a second. The numbers just refresh like 100 times a second on the screen and the stats are weird as well. Just a 10s spin on the bench and I got this:

![image|230x500](upload://2ePTKSynMZ24q69ciU7pkhcSJCB.jpg)

It looks like values are refreshing way more often that it used to, like the update cycle is 100 times a second or so.

But metr crashed after the ride and lost the today status plus the record made today, the record was already stopped for 10 min

If the record was already stopped, there is a very little chance it was lost. I think it should be there, you can also navigate with file browser and find it manually (each record has 2 files *.r and *.s extensions)

Today I borrowed Android 8 and tested location fix which seems to work fine in the latest version (2.2.64)

This is expected behavior. You probably didn't notice that records on top are marked as "Favorites". I agree that might be hard to see, I should make it more obvious.

Favorite records will always appear on top. If you don't want that, remove them from favorites.

for some reason the data got corrupted and firmware version was detected as `0.0`, which in turn resulted in using old command codes (for 2.x) firmware and completely messed up Realtime Data. I will try to provide a fix soon!

Yeah it does look a lot like a GPS chip, but the external antenna looks like a nrf/BT/wifi type antenna instead of an external GPS antenna. :thinking:

One of the new features in Bluetooth 5 is greatly increased range, could be one of these new modules. Of course you'd only go to this much effort to increase range if you were planning control via BT too.

@Surfer, I'm now able to connect HM10 to an Android 8 phone (I had to lower to 9600 bauds because of my (useless) voltage divider I have to remove, but too lazy).
But, I did the same upgrade to a Metr.at (HM11) module on another build but no luck to have it recognized by metr.at app.
I set UUID and name up to match the previous settings (before upgrading).

So I screwed a metr.at module up... :worried:

What did you do for having it working after firmware upgrade ?

Sorry if I didn't explain well enough,  my English is quite short.
I did not touch the firmware on the BT module, only on the phone. 
Downgraded to 7.1, the phone was able to see and connect with metr module and fully working.
Later I upgraded to Oreo 8.1 via OTA, and surprisingly I find it still working.
Good luck with the module, bring it back to life! ;)

Feature request! New board setup, when the app detects a new module/board, would love to fill in some ride stats to start with.

"Is this a new board or would you like to fill in existing information?" 

So I can put in the old info from my old module when the new metr pro arrives and also add km's from when I got app crashes. Easier to track totale distance ridden on board.

Hi Manu, the VESC-Software uses the GPLV3-License. Open Source and Apples App-Store policies are not compatible and probably never will be. So you will need to invest into a tablet or phone running Android, being Open Source friendly.

@webst thank you, all valid points. I am trying to fix apple watch slow wake up problem. When you raise the wrist, it takes a couple of seconds to display current data, because watchOS is somewhat restrictive and suspends the app when you are not looking at it (unless it is a workout session). I need to find a way to keep it running in background.

 Feature request Sir Roman :
- Add the cell voltage label.

Since I switched to 12S, I'm not able anymore to quickly calculate the average cell voltage based on the total voltage. Could you add this info ?

Also, while helping @Manu39 to debug his app, we figured out that french translation is really inaccurate. We had to switch his app back in english to find the proper settings (mine is kept in english to avoid that).
Few years ago I worked on a racing timing app that used Getlocalization website.
Each time the dev added a string, we (contributors) could propose a translation for it.
Very powerful tool for multilingual app. ;)
Maybe it could help.

Thank you for the suggestions!

I just created a repository with the latest translation files https://github.com/rpasichnyk/metr-translations and some instructions. You are welcome to make improvements!

@rpasichnyk, are there any plans to include data from e.g. the DieBieMS, (which is can-bus capable), this way individual cells could be monitored/logged.
Or maybe as a more general option create a feature to subscribe to custom parameters with a settable CAN-id and field
```

## \#1070 Posted by: lock Posted at: 2018-06-20T14:44:01.357Z Reads: 139

It may already work, albeit in a slightly primitive manner. 

You‚Äôd need to set the can fwd to point to the DieBieMS, open the terminal in metr, then type in ‚Äúcells‚Äù. That should ‚Äòin theory‚Äô return a list of cell voltages as a plain text response. The DieBieMS supports a subset of VESC commands, so many apps will just treat it as if they are talking to a VESC.

I agree it‚Äôd be nice to see some specialised support for the DieBieMS in some of these apps. I‚Äôm not sure how final the DieBieMS message interface is though. May be worthwhile waiting to see what jtag does with the DieBieMS Tool.

@rpasichnyk I got a few Metr Ori and hit one up and running quickly, they are great. 

So I am running vesc6 with ack fw 3.1. I am able to get iOS apps running esk8 vesc, telematics and metr. But for some reason not perimetr, which does not even see the ble chip. Is this a fw problem?  Even though th metr does fine job of baud rate hopping/negotiation, I did flip between 115200 and 9600 just to check but no success with perimetr. Any pointers on what I am doing wrong?

Also, on android I am able to get metr working fine but not perimetr and unfortunately not ackmaniac vesc tool. Ackmaniac app sees metr chip but is not able to propagate fields in the main screen as vesc not recognized. This was a problem once before wit metr chip but was simple baud rate fix which does not work this time. Guidance on what to try, or do I need to change fw?

Thanks!

Is it possible to fix modes to work on @Ackmaniac 3.102? When writing a mode it just hangs and fails to write the new limits (on original module). I would really appreciate if you can fix this, 3.101 had a bug and most of us updated to 3.102 but we lost the sweet modes feature.

@egzplicit the problem is not really in the app, but in the firmware. He changed `PACKET_RX_TIMEOUT` from 1000 to 50ms (https://github.com/Ackmaniac/bldc/commit/9d86699b72938cd2fef94d7e43ae4546d13c8913#diff-2e0b1c4c38062090ba1ff05dab9f7e49), which is why write motor configuration packet times out. Can you change it back to 1000, recompile and test?

No, I haven't tried to recreate your issue yet, but from I can see in the log file, you did a lot of actions :slight_smile: like enabling CAN Fwd, applying modes, also two different VESC firmware versions. Not trying to blame you or anything, just need time to go through the log and maybe try it on my test setup.


For everyone: Please don't enable CAN Fwd unless you are 100% sure that you need it. Metr app figures out the number of connected VESCs automatically. When you switch modes, they are also switched on both VESCs automatically. If you enable CAN Fwd, the automatic detection will stop.

@rpasichnyk So I just hooked up my meter module to my new build and my metr app or perimeter app can't detect it. Phone is Android 8.0.0, but Acmaniac's app can see the module however it can't interact with it fully. 
My baud rate is 9600 I also tried 115200 or something like that, that was suggested above. Did not work. 
The red light keeps flashing all the time. Is there anything I need to do to get this running?

How do I connect the meter with BLDC Tolls on MacOS by bluetooth?

I see only this and can not connect.
-----------

I found. It is necessary in the meter to activate the TCP bridge and the TCP server input in BLDC tools.

But now he writes:
The connected VESC has too old firmware. Since the connected VESC has firmware with bootloader support, it can be updated from the Firmware page. Until then, limited communication mode will be used where only the firmware can be changed.

Although I put the latest version of VESC - FW 3.34 I used MacOS and BLDC Tools 0.95 - not work
But when I used  BLDC Tools 0.87 - all work

@Ingvarjedi Bluetooth connection to your Mac is only possible with the Metr Pro module. For the standard module you can only use TCP bridge for wireless connection.
For me that sounds like your firmware update didn't worked and you are still on the old firmware. What does the BLDC Tool 0.87 you can connect to says about which firmware is installed?

@RyuX Normally Ackmaniac's firmware 3.102 should be supported. I don't have access to a VESC right now, so maybe someone else using that firmware can confirm if changing modes is working for them.

Hey @hexakopter 

What is also strange is that my bluetooth module (metr-444) will not show up in the ESC Monitor from Ackmaniac (but it did some months ago when i last tried).
However the metr bluetooth module will connect with the metr app and I can read the current VESC values properly - but when trying to Apply modes it will say writing to Vesc #1 for around 5-10 seconds and then stop without any error message. However when reading the current values I see that nothing has been applied :frowning:

Edit: I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge with Android Oreo 8.0 - however i experience the same issues with a S5 and Android Kitkat.
Also another strange thing is that the metr.at App will work with the bluetooth module - however if I try to scan for the bluetooth module again it will not find it. So basically I can not find the module on any app (Ackmaniac VESC Monitor, metr.at, perimetr) it is only working on metr.at App because it was already found. Is there something on the module itself that makes it "invisible" ?
```

I have a very strange issue that I just noticed. For some reason my uploaded data is different than the data reported in the app and not just a little different.

@RyuX your module is not showing up, because BLE **discovery** is not working on Android 8 with old modules. The important to understand it is only **discovery** that does not work. If the module is already discovered and Android knows it's MAC address, you can connect to it and communicate with it. When different apps perform BLE discovery operation, they can not find metr-444 old module. Regarding modes, try to apply again and right after that Settings Show Logs and send to support@metr.at

@strattos Thanks for your report. I can explain how that happened. Both the app and the web app ignore some data, because plotting all the values would take too much time. The reason you noticed such dramatic difference is because you have extreme point in your record that is 52kmh surrounded by 25kmh and 15kmh (you most likely just pressed the throttle when holding the board in your hand or something). This point was ignored in the app, but not the web app. I will try to fix it :)

@RyuX This happened because Ackmaniac changed `PACKET_RX_TIMEOUT` in 3.102 from 1000 to 50 milliseconds (no idea why btw). When you try apply the mode, the `MC_WRITE_CONF` packet is quite big and it needs to be split to multiple pieces. It gets timed out before fully transferred.

https://github.com/Ackmaniac/bldc/commit/9d86699b72938cd2fef94d7e43ae4546d13c8913#diff-2e0b1c4c38062090ba1ff05dab9f7e49R26

Metr Pro still works though, because it assembles the packet in memory before sending to VESC. But not the old modules.

3) use official firmware 3.40

You don't need Windows, there are good video editors for macOS too. Both iMovie and Final Cut Pro X support PNG sequence. There are probably more. Personally I never had issues with VIRB Edit and managed to sync without issues.

@mikenyc you can compile and flash VESC on macOS in Terminal simply by following Vedders tutorial for Ubuntu, gcc-arm 4.9 toolchain can be installed from px4 with homebrew (same for openocd) ;)

Am I right, that the perimetr part of the iOS app should work fine?
Running VESC6 with 3.40 original firmwarfe.

Running the last version, if i read from Modes/perimeter - the figues from vesc1 are not all correct.
For example "Sensor Mode" is set to "Sensored" but it is read as "Sensorless" - 
The Hall Table figures are listed doubled. In the first listment, they seem wrong starting with 255,1,3,2,5,6,4,255. But I dont find these in the VESC-Tool.

And if i write to the Vescs - the config will be destroyed - and I loose connection to VESC2

Or what did I miss?

If you are the lucky one to have a DieBieMS we have some good news for you! The latest Metr app includes support for it!

https://gph.is/2ORNBwl

Features:

1. Battery percent displayed in Metr app is precisely calculated by BMS (State of Charge) using consumed mAh and not by just looking at voltage. When you hit the throttle or brake, battery percent doesn't change dramatically.

2. When you click on Battery percent, you have a DieBieMS screen where you can see individual voltages for each group, BMS temperature, charging current. There is also a glowing green drop icon on some cells, which means they are currently in balancing state.

3. When you plug the charger, DieBieMS screen opens and closes automatically

After you wire up everything Metr will detect the BMS and everything should just work. If you don't have it yet there is a group buy which we highly recommend https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diebiems-v0-8-batch-3

:heart: :heart: :heart: 
Thanks to @JTAG for amazing work and to @Samau18 for doing a series of group buys!
We would also like to thank @oyta for contributing not one, but two Norwegian translations (Bokm√•l and Nynorsk) for the whole Metr app. If you want to contribute a new translation or improve existing one you are very welcome to do so http://github.com/rpasichnyk/metr-translations

I have the the diebiems installed

If I press the battery percentage it doesn't switch to the cell voltage screen.

however I can choose en and see the cell voltage tile. So there is a connection.

Any thoughts?

Cell voltage tile does not indicate there is a connection. It simply divides voltage by S number in settings. Make sure you connected CAN bus properly. Then maybe try to use Terminal in metr app, enable CANFwd and set CAN ID to 10, then write ‚Äúhelp‚Äù in Terminal

Does the connection from VESC Tool to the metr-BLE-Module@VESC6 work for the normal/older metr-Modules or only for metr.pro? I'm running the normal metr-Module together with my iPhone via BLE and it works. I can also see the metr module in VESC Tool as a BLE device (using the compiled version for OS X you provided) - but it does not connect. Thanks!

## :birthday: TWO YEAR ANNIVERSARY UPDATE :birthday: 

:mega: TL,DR: Audio Announcements, Expert (Perimetr), BLACK Friday SALE
 
Hello fellow builders, today is the second anniversary of **metr.at** project. A lot of good stuff happened during the past year, but the most notable events are @hexakopter joining the team and Metr Pro bluetooth module launch. We are thankful for all the feedback we got from this amazing community :heart_eyes: and very excited to continue our work.

:sunny::sunny::sunny:

We are celebrating by releasing the new version of Metr App
with **Audio Announcements** :headphones:
![announceTab|325x500](upload://6gtK62pVWbGWQ1U5IyuiMrX4PnF.png) 
We found this feature surprisingly useful and in some cases even more convenient than smartwatch. A simple example is when you are moving and need to keep your eyes 100% focused on the road, but you want to know your speed or current consumption right here right now.
![announceView|325x500](upload://g1x8OzOGg8waWvLbnC9IdyIDisJ.png) 

The announcements are flexible so you can configure interval and upper / lower limits. This allows you for example to do things like this:

* Tell speed every 30 seconds when speed is below 20kph
* Tell speed every 5 seconds when speed is above 20kph and 30kph
* Tell speed every 1 second when speed is above 30kph

It will hopefully help you to keep attention and increase your awareness. Another nice addition is that announcements are automatically done in the current language. Thanks again everyone who contributed the translations! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: There are quite a few now! Deutsch :de: , Espa√±ol :es:, Fran√ßais :fr: , Italiano :it: , Norsk :norway: (Bokm√•l, Nynorsk), Portuguese :portugal: , –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π :ru: 

![sidebar|332x500](upload://rtCMoUVbZH06iz6rrD9nqbweDSX.png)  
The UI got a little refresh, mainly because it was hard to find Perimetr. It is now easier and since the name was somewhat confusing, it is just called **Expert** now. In Expert mode you can change any Parameter (Motor Configuration or App Configuration) for any connected VESC and you have convenient omnibox to search it.

![expert|330x500](upload://96YS4sIo3baS4BF4JGzwlgmiYVS.png) 

:black_heart: :black_heart: :black_heart:  
Finally, we decided to do a **BLACK Friday SALE**, which you can find in a separate topic [**HERE**](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/metr-pro-20-black-friday-sale)
:black_heart: :black_heart: :black_heart:  

Thank you! :)

---
## \#1226 Posted by: rpasichnyk Posted at: 2018-12-11T09:30:10.926Z Reads: 107

Just divide consumed Wh by distance is a simple and easy solution, but it gets a bit boring after a while, because you don't see any changes over time. When you use a floating window (for example 5 seconds) then you can see / hear how the consumption is changing depending on what you are doing

@rene this is a very nice idea, thank you :slight_smile:
@Bjork3n modes should work with 3.102. If something is not working, please report it, send logs etc. etc. :slight_smile:

No, it doesn't make sense if you are using the old module. What you can also do is enable "Automatic Records". Then new one should start automatically after a few seconds if the old one is stopped and you are still moving.

You can use @Ackmaniac 3.103 with a METR module, change modes with METR app or Ack app, use TCP/IP connectivity to config, etc.  You can also use the newer VESC firmware, but I like Ack's better as it makes more sense.

The important feature of Metr app is that you can use **any** VESC firmware with it (well, most of them), works just fine, all features supported.

Then there are usually 3 groups of people:

1. Those who always use latest, get new features first, but may have some new bugs as well
2. Wait a few weeks and let the group 1 be guinea pigs
3. Configure and forget, do not fix if it's not broken

Then you just need to decide what you want :slight_smile:
