I just changed my e-mtb from a 12s TB ESC to using a vesc.  Im not sure which version.  Possibly 4.18.  With the TB esc, I was getting pretty good acceleration from low speed, but a max of 19 to 20mph.  With the change from the TB esc to the vesc, plus hall sensors configured for BLDC, I can accelerate from a stand still without the cogging, but its really slow, until you get to around 10mph, then its like turbo.   

Shoots up to 20 (guessing, because it was a little too fast for my taste and I backed it down, but my GPS wasn't being very responsive, I couldn't tell how fast I was going beyond 20, but it was still accelerating, where the TB ESC's top out at 19 to 20.   

Can someone take a look at these motor vesc settings and let me know if this is good for a 10s battery?
