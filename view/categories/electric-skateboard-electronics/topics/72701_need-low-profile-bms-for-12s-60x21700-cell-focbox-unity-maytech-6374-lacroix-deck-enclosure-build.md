I am currently in the process of purchasing components for my build, 

This currently includes,

FOCBOX Unity
60x21700 cells
Maytech 6374 3kW Motors X 2
LaCroix deck and enclosure

I am struggling to find a suitable BMS with a low enough profile, to enable me to squeeze it in above the cells in one of the larger compartments. 

I have thought about not using a BMS, but decided against it, as I want to make it "idiot" proof

The max size for the BMS is 200mm X 60mm X 14mm

Any suggestions??

Are you sure 21700 will fit?

yes, 

If you purchase the complete board, it is currently shipped with 20700 cells. The CAD model i knocked up from measurements i had, shows the cells should fit fine, with a little space down the centre.
