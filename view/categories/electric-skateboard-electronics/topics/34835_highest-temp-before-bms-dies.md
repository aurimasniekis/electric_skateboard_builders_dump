Hi everyone, I just received the cells for my evolve upgrade. I have tried different wiring configurations but in the end I will go with this <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/8/68ee0c90d2d81f9f0483e7031e32cfc6afd53988.png" width="193" height="500">
The problem with this configuration is that there is no where to put the bms unless i extend the enclosure or route the deck. 
I have no tools to do both.

I am planning to stack the bms above the esc and use some rubber gaskets as risers for the enclosure so it will all fit. 

Is this a bad idea? The esc gets really hot when riding so that might damage the bms. 

The bms aids with discharging i believe so I am not sure if i want to put it above the battery pack as it might just get too hot and damage the cells.

Any advice?
