I have 2 of these batteries and they work well without a bms, but I don't want to disconnect them every day to charge the batteries, would I be able to use this bms for charge only? Please comment on any other cheap BMSs that you guys like if you know of any. 

[Note] I love the Bestech BMSs, but they are hard to find and are expensive and I don't really need discharge capabilities (I would just be plugging the batteries into the esc directly by the xt60s like this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdylrv1iSHI [TIME= 2:49 - 3:00]).

I'm planning on doing the same setup, and I was wondering if you have a wiring diagram for batteries, BMS and ESC. It's not 100% clear in my head yet how to wire all that, especially when you don't want to use the discharge protection of the BMS.

It has been periodically reported on this forum that those type of bms's tend to be unreliable.
