I made a wii nunchuck Remote for my electric longboard,  using attiny85 and stx882 transmitter receiver. Range is poor soo i added a wire to screw that holds the on off switch soo that when we hold the remote our hand touches it and our body works as antenna. Which works amazingly great!!

Here are some pictures<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/b/ab9254010c52e5d7b9815381cc6df30c770b1bde.jpg" width="374" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/1/d18122032228cd138b2fca2a3bab7cd55a4e872a.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/d/5dcb611d5a1795b4b5b8e89501d8410743914179.jpg" width="375" height="500">
