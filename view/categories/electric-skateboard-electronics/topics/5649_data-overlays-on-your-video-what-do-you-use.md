Great, nice video btw.  I am still looking at iphone apps for speedometer, distance, HUD etc, which ones did you use for the video and like the best in general.  Sorry to derail the thread, PM me if easier, thanks!

I used a Garmin Virb camera, which records all sorts of data and connects to GPS (to get things like the map for the loop, speed, elevation, etc) 

so as far as apps, I can't really help ya.. just buy a Garmin Virb X or XE :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

yep.. but that won't get you any data. 

The garmin devices all export the same tyoe of data that can be read by the virb editting app, and then translated into thousands of different gauges. 

so what I tend to do is just leave my virb on throughout my whole ride/trip/filming sesh so that I have consitent data across the board that can be overlayed onto any one of my 3 cameras.

Not sure how good or even if this works. might have been a spambot promoting.

I've got that app that Lulu said. Haven't recorded anything yet but the overlay looks good.

An acquaintance of mine created the [Trace Up](http://www.traceup.com/). I haven't had a chance to test it out yet but it's supposed to be cool. I'll try to get my hands on one soon.

That's a powerful little action camera. Not sure why anyone would buy a go pro over it. Garmin should do a little more marketing to let people know it exists

I know!!

For me the only downside is the 1080p 60fps limit, but in actually 4k isn't really mainstream yet.. it's just nice for cropping.

check out this video (on the garmin website homepage) showing the different overlays based on the sensors: 
http://virb.garmin.com/en-US/

http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2016/03/garmin-virbxe-review.html

also worth a look as this guy reviews basically every action camera, fitness watch, or anything with tech and activities you can imagine. He definitely shows its strengths and weaknesses well. 

also, I wouldn't say it's highjacking the thread; haha this thread was on jacobs hubz page, so I moved it to its own..

True. But if you have a gps device you can get the data and import it as well.

Heres a video i used gopro camera and my phone for gps data then imported into virb software.

The [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.garmin.android.apps.virb) will only work with a virb camera. There is no information that it can work with any footage.

So you just recorded everything with the gopro, recorded gps data with the smartphone app and then used the software to merge both?

I dont want to annoy you... I just want to get it clean:

You used a GoPro (the camera doesnt matter as long as it can record a video) and you used Strava for the gps data?

That sounds nice because i do not need to change my app :)

Thats exactly what I did. Gopro video. Strava gps data. Import both into virb software. Synchronise  (this can be a little fiddly to get right) and choose your overlays etc. Done.

What about the vesc overlay?  That's a lot of great info that goes unnoticed on the bottom of the board.  How to record it?

I think you need to have a laptop tethered to it lol. Thats what benjamin did in his demo video:

So you could just have a laptop in a backpack.

Any more to add to the list? I recently download / used this app:

Autoboy blackbox

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.happyconz.blackbox&hl=lv

The problem with the app is that, you have to somehow export the ''info'' file to the video directly, as the data is only shown when you view the video in the app.. on the sd card/phone storage, the video is without the overlay.. If I get it working or find another app, I will let others know!

If you are using Strava, try free service Vochiloop https://vochiloop.com 
Just record videos during activity and Vochiloop will add telemetric data from Strava activity right onto your videos. So easy, in one click. Here is the example output: https://youtu.be/sFTLJZ0tiR8
Android phones are fully supported, iPhone users should use direct plug or cloud service to access original video files and upload them to Vochiloop using desktop web browser. Standalone camera users should set accurate time on cameras to prevent telemetry data shifting against video frames.
I'm the service developer, happy to answer any related questions.
