I'm trying to organize a group build and I have every thing sorted, except for the tiny problem that [this remote](http://www.diyeboard.com/new-version-3-speed-mode-24ghz-mini-remote-controller-rc5-p-575.html) doesn't have a reciever! It only works with their proprietary ESC, and we are going to be using VESCs. Does anybody have a recommendation for a similar remote I could get for ~$15 each if we buy in bulk? Thank you!
