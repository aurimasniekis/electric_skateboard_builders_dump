The desire of lighting came up when I built my friend's board. I drew up a system diagram of how to easily connect LED strips to your board with the unused receiver portion of the 2nd VESC. If you are using a single VESC, you will need to reduce the number of LEDs by 50% to prevent overloading the BEC. No extra special materials needed.

This specific LED system was chosen since it runs off USB 2.0 (3-4W low power consumption) and it uses RF rather than IR to control the LEDs. No need to point the remote at the receiver or mount outside of the board. Operating range is about 10-20ft.

This board was built for Scott, you can find more info on his Instagram: @scott_dred_og

Please enjoy!

Thanks!

I haven't seen any issues with the FlipSky VESCs so far and the board has over 200 miles on it already. We ride twice a week.

Nothing wrong with flipsky vescs, better than most 4.12 on the market. Only the 4.20 are bad
