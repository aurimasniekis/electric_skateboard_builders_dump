hello I have searched most of the topics  but I could not find one that narrows down my issue

I have a dual vesc set up connected through canbus, using a 6s setup and for some reason whenever I try to turn it on one of the vecs flashes 3 times

I have narrowed it down by using terminal and I get a fault code- drv3802 but this is only when I try to run 6s lipo 

on the other hand when I try to run at 3s it works fine 

any help would be much appreciated.
