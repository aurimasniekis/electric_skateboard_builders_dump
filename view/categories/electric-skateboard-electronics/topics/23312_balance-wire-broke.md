So on my balance lead of my Lipo, the black wire snapped inside the insulating plastic Its a 3s1p pack and I'm just wondering where the black wire leads to underneath the blue plastic - I don't want to peal away all the blue plastic. And yes I have already tried soldering the wire back together again any help would be appreciated <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/c/fc6a48c60a7fc3c8587073a6ec341166de78f569.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/d/0d271e1be011b3f8a8a5e72efe033772501f882c.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/5/951874d7655729f4593b3136c0781a2eb6d222c7.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

The black balance wire will need to be soldered to the main negative lead of the battery.

As said you can skip trying to get it back where it started from and instead connect it to the main black lead luckily as it's the end balance lead

So I could solder it to my negative of my xt60?

talk about luck.. that's the best balance lead to break if your going to break one.
