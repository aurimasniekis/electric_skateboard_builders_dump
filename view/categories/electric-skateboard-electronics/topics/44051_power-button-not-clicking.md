I bought a new button for my board that has a four pin connector that plugs straight into the power switch board. Board turns on when I hold the power button down, but as soon as I release it turns off. The button itself won't stay pressed when pushed. I'm unsure if this is a mechanical issue or an electrical issue

edit: I'm dumb, didn't buy a toggle button

Did you buy a momentary switch? If so that's the problem. Happened to me once, didn't realize discription said momentary -.-

I just checked and you're right, I didn't buy a toggle switch.

I bought the power switch from you actually, where did you get the buttons from for your power switches?

You can get them pretty much anywhere in different colors.
This is one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N751TAW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_5-syAb6PG39BY

I got blue ones.

I recommend this one. It has a stronger spring than others Iv'e tried and it comes with a quick disconnect plug.
It's 16mm which I like but they also come in 19mm and multiple colors.
