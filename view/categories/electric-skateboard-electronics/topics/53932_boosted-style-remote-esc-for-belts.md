I’m beginning to layout my first build/transfer and have read a lot about how much smoother and overall better the new boosted style remote and esc are. The one used in the ownboard/wowgo2S. 

I’m going to be using my board to commute and am worried about hub motors longevity on LA concrete, therefore looking to build a dual belt system possibly. 

Is there anyway to use the newer style esc/remote with a dual belt system? 

Second question, anyone out there can attest to the durability and usability of own/wowgo/etc hubs for commuting? Do your teeth shake loose from it for instance? 

Thanks for anyone’s help.
