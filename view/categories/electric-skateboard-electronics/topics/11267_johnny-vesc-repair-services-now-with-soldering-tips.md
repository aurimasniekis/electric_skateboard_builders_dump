Hello Everyone,

For those who don't know me, my Name is Jean-FranÃ§ois I've been a technicien in electronic for the last 13 year, and I've work 10 of them as a technicien specialize in troubleshooting and repair for high quality production line. I also do my work using with IPC and ISO standard. 

I want to Offer my services at low cost, for repairing VESC. Since I've repair and build all my VESC so far, I'm not really aware of the repair market for the VESC. So, I'm not really sure if it is a good price, but my price is 30$ (parts include)+ shipping, I live in Canada, shipping price from the US is around 20-25. I also, want to set a turn around time of 24 to 48hrs after the reception. 

I can also do more specific or out of the ordinary stuff... Like changing the color of your LCD, making weird Y connector or anything that require good soldering skill.... ( but in these case price may vary, depending on the work needed).


Thank 

JF

A Vesc repairman is much needed in this community.

Nice to see a repair man! Only thing is, by the time you pay shipping to you and back it could end up being $80 and a new vesc from enertion is $89 right now. If people are willing to pay that though, why not? Again, the community needs it and good luck to you.

Thank Guys..

It's sad to see all this good electronic go to waste. 

But total cost is more around 60 for one  (20-25 for the shipping take in consideration the send and return cost)

This is great Johnny! After all DRV failures going around we could really use a VESC repair shop. If you get enough interest you should make a website! :)

Ah, that's too bad. Was going to ask if you can repair my Raptor (Vesc problem) thru @onloop but I don't think battery can cross that international lines ðŸ¤”

GOOD TIPS!!! I just bought about 4ft silicone red and black 10awg wires and was waiting for something like this. I would always burn my fingers trying to hold in place as I soldered to th connector tabs. :head_bandage:

Lav you very much.

So I've got a couple dead TB VESC 4.12s lying around. They won't connect to BLDC tool and I'm sure I've blown the DRV in both, and most likely the microcontrollers. For diagnosing anything else that might have gotten toasted, is there any direction you would point me in besides just perusing the vesc github and pulling out my (old as f) oscilloscope and multimeter?

@dimnsionofsound and @sprocket12 If you don't mind sending private message or you can email me at repair@drvwizard.com it would be easier for me to work the details with you.

@wmj259 Sorry I've been busy and overwhelm by hundred Million (give or take a few dozen ðŸ˜‰) project, but I will try to do some follow up on this one, once I get a little bit more time.

Regards
JF

Since I already have DRVs from mouser and access to a hot air soldering station I was more trying to ask if you had any troubleshooting tips besides replacing the DRV and ÂµC, if that does not work.

I'm going to start by doing that and then if that doesn't fix the problem, attempting to test more of the components, and then if that doesn't work, I'll give up and send them over haha.

I don't really mind revealing my tricks, since people are now making Vesc that don't fry DRV. Maybe I could do a video about it later this week.

Just want to say a big shout out to Jean-FranÃ§ois! Fixed my VESC and helped me solder an xt-90 antispark for only 45$. Worked over the holidays to get it done within like 2-3 days. Really helpful! 10/10 would recommend this man
