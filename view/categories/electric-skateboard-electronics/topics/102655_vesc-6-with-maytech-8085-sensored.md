I am looking to build a dual motor atb and wire the maytech 8085 sensored to the vesc 6+. I don't have the parts yet, so I can't confirm but from pictures I can see that the maytech 8085 has a 6 pin sensor cable connector. Where the vesc is using a 7 pin connector according to Trampa.
How can this work?

Probably my most visited page from TB: 

https:///collections/electrical-connectors/products/vesc-sensor-wires

Or you can just solder the wires if you know the layout

How many pins does the vesc 6+ have? 6 or 7?

Here it looks like less of a problem as both ends have 6 pins. But Trampa says the vesc 6+ has a 7 pin connector.
