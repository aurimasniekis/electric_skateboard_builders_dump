Hi, so I was charging my board and I blew a resistor in the charger. I have this charger: http://www.ultrapower.hk/product.asp?id=38&cid=1 and have no idea what resistor this is, but want I to buy a new one so I can replace it (the resistor). <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/3/0306853375e09c6f521e26c7811b4513fe84edab.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/6/c67ec691475e7ef9d854bfc56666967d8ee823cb.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Did you try using a resistor calculator? I tried to, but I can't distinguish the colors in the picture. You can try this one if you know the colors https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code-5-band
