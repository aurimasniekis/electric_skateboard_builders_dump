I have a new set of butterballs and was wondering if I vould build a board around them. Since 65mm is fairly small having a betl setup would be a little difficult due to clearance. So anyone know of 65mm hubs?

No, and I can't imagine the problems that would come from such small hub motors. You need space to fit as much copper as possible for torque. As it is, at 83mm, heat is an issue. I can't imagine the heat at 65mm.

A 4 wheel drive 65mm hub motor might be possible. 4 little guys would spread the heat and torque out. But I've yet to see anyone make such a small motor. I will still being waiting for the day I can put hub motors on my trick skateboard with 50mm wheels lol.
