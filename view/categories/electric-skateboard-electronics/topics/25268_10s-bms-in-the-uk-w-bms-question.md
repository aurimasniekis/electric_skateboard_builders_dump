Hello,

Just working out the price it will cost me to make a custom Li-ion battery pack and have come to the BMS. I cant find anywhere thats decent in the UK to buy one. APS does have a 10S BMS but they are away when I was planning to buy all the parts/have money for it!

Anybody know of a place to buy a BMS suitable for 10s Esk8 in the UK? 
I've read that generally bigger BMS's are better as there is less chance of them frying and also, I've seen that you can remove the AMP limit from BMS's so you can charge them faster, is this correct?

Note: If I cant find any, would anybody be interested in buying one with me from Bestech as I believe they require two to be bought at any one time.

Depending on the shipping time they quote, I will be up for this!

Will also be good if they ship both BMS's directly to both of us

Alright, where are you from? I think they'll send it in one package but shouldn't be too much of a hassle.
