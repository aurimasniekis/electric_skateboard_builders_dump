10s2p Litokitta 30Q, uses 4x 4 cell holders and 2x 2 cell holders, screwed into deck (1 screw per 2 cells),
16awg silicone wire sonnectibe everything, clamped with steel and insulted with 0.25" of craft foam

Whatcha think?  Gonna use sheet steel to make an enclosure and I'll trim the bolts then

I was thinking of doing the same for my first board until I read up on NESE and realized not only how important it is to have a strong connection throughout vibrations while riding, but also that cheap 18650 cell holders from China definitely aren't rated for the amount of amps we draw with our boards.

I don't think anyone's ever tested it for science though, and I don't think much can go wrong as long as you are prepared to jump off at any moment :smiley:

Just rode hard for 3 miles on it and it's holding firm, even after bottoming out on a curb

Will continue for science

Motors don't draw more than 19A past the BMS/ESC junction according to a power meter

I've been using these cells and holder for a month but they sat upright in a cardboard box bolted to the rear trucks...now they hang down

You know those mixing machines they use to add pigment to paint tins in hardware stores? That's what's happening to your battery when you rattle down the road and transition from pavement to tarmac and go over rocks and obstacles. Except it's not for 60 seconds, it's for thousands of miles.

Still feel confident? If so, you'll be fiiiiiiiiiiiine.

Is it really that much worse than welding?  Those don't experience fatigue and the weak point is a steel bar...should be fine

I ride even split on brick, concrete sidewalk, and cracked asphalt so it's a hell of a test... usually 5 miles a day at 15mph

im thinking the cells are fake :man_facepalming:

also those cell holders are not meant for high amps, id say 5a tops

Oh yeah the cells are definitely fake

I though so too but using the tiny 3x1mm pins they've been sustaining 5amps continuous and 10amps burst without visible signs, which is kinda impressive

I'm confused...if the whole pack is giving 20a then each p-pack is doing 20a, and amps are distributed across every cell in the p-pack, so if it's 2p each cell is outputting 10a right?

yes....

10s2p

there are only 2 paralell groups in 10s2p meaning that the load is split between the two p groups (not exactally but)

[quote="ZachTetra, post:18, topic:91351"]
then each p-pack is doing 20a
[/quote]

no each p group is doing 10a because there are two p groups, meaning the load is split between the p goups, meaning 10a per p group




^but this again is not exactally the case cause the load is split between the whole entire pack

20a current draw on 10s2p it’s 10a draw per cell. 



How to test if your battery is good and making good contact throughout its abusive treatment and still making good contact?  You could Measure the voltages of the p-groups and see what the change is through time and do it without a bms that would change things.  That’s what I do w my suspect battery.

So run it without letting it get to the balance voltage?  I've gone about 3 cycles doing that and it got 0.02v out of balance

That’s barely out of balance.  I don’t use a bms and check voltages w a multimeter.  If u really want to see if ur connectors are working and the different cells in the p group are getting equal connection and equal discharge the bms should be off.

@ZachTetra, why don’t you just get someone to build the 12s4p battery for you, your just asking for trouble with those cell holders. You have all the materials, maybe just send it to @M.Hboards and get it assembled. All you need is some nickel strips and fish paper, better then risking 48 authentic Samsung 30q’s

But cell holders are cheap and I wouldn't be as proud if someone made it for me, I will look into it though... ideally I just get tabs on the cells and anchor those because the holders are nice to use

I’m just trying to look out for you because being cheap can get you killed with batteries. What if your going down hill and some cells fall out causing a big cutout and you are left with no choice but to jump off?

Thanks man, I appreciate it.  Sometimes its good to have someone talk sense into you.  I think the small battery pack is stable for now, but I'll try to do better with the large one.  I was gonna have a proper battery using tabs straight from NKON and 10awg but GoGoMrRobot was selling the cells and BMS I wanted so I caved, in retrospect it wasn't the right option but its to late now

I get about 140Wh then it goes to 30V under normal amp draw...I can squeeze another 20Wh at death crawl

I'm averaging 13Wh/mi but it's with lots of stop and go, down to 8Wh/mi Ina straight line

I sense sarcasm!  I just check the p groups, so 12 groups of 4p checked.  it’s a bit of work but if cells are becoming disconnected it probably is more likely to be one of the p-group and not a series connection which would turn the board off.  That’s how it went with me and showed up in my looking at the 12p groups.   Then fixed the issue and have gone happily from there.  I think a lot of people have used compression things like he’s using but there’s some that have very under specd contacts and wires for most people’s power wants.   I don’t know what he’s using really.  They could be bolstered electricity and physically though at least.

I raise or lower the group voltage with another cell being put in parallel.  There a bunch of ways to do it but this seems easiest.   A cell connected temporarily with two wires.  I’ve thrown extreme variances of voltage in parallel and surprised how slow it is to balance using the 30q.  It’s not instant and could take minutes...and maybe that’s a good thing.  Doesn’t get beyond a hair warm

I’m hoping to find a giant resistor instead to do the same with. That’s be even easier.  Do some ohms law and figure what resistance would be acceptable

I broke and repaired 2 packs recently. It's pretty annoying, takes forever to get series group voltages in the same place. I wire my packs so I can use my expensive hobby charger to balance, but the voltmeters in the hobby charger don't quite agree with bms, so everything takes forever, hoqrs and hours.

I've got a quad 1.5a cell charger, is it good enough to bring them to the highest cell voltage individually?  Also as long as a single cell in each p-pack is connected wont they balance out when reconnected?

I don’t know ur charger really.  Is it a “wall wart” for a phone or something?  They will work but I’d be careful.  I’ve done that. They aren’t a regulated power supply I think.  I think.  So they don’t make as smooth and ideal a charge.  And more worrisome some will go to a too high voltage as they’re designed to be controlled by your phones bms or whatever they call it. Some of them are stated at 5v.  I think it’s fine as long as youre aware and watching voltages rise.  Maybe just balance everything to 4v at least. No need to balance at 4.2 like a bms does

Drained one dry, killed 2p groups and badly weakened another 2. Couldn't bring them back. The dead cells were interesting. Charged them up carefully and slowly. The cells got somewhat warm. Took them off charge and it kept getting warmer slowly. Got to 180f at some point. The pack spent the night outside. And in the morning the hot cells were like 1v. Haha this is the hummie deck and motors!

The other one, bms killed a p group, drained it to zero. At least it gave me a clue by not letting the pack charge. Surprisingly the board still ran, but very weak. Reuair was easy but rebalancing was a pain using a lab psu. The re-tested the bms to confirm, which meant another balancing session.

Yes charging to 4.2 takes forever because of the CV curve. It's faster to get them in the ballpark and drain them down for balancing.
