Hi all!

I’ve an M1 and I’d like to use / mod its ESC.

It has an Arm processors and USB port so it might be “easy” to reprogram.

Do you have any experience with it?

Mod the ESC to do what? I highly doubt it will be easy to do anything firmware wise looking at how nicely they've implemented software updates through their app.
