After using the wiiceiver for several months it has been nothing but problem after problem. So I am getting rid of it and just going to go the GT2B route. That said I am using an FVT 120a 6s esc. I have a programming card and want to flash the eSk8 firmware to it. The only problem is the port on the programming card is weird and I don't know what it is, so I don't know what to buy. Do any of you know what type of cable it is? Any tips for updating the firmware? 

Your help is all ways greatly apprecited!

Pretty sure @torqueboards flashes custom firmware to his escs.

The 6s ones can be flashed too. I had to reflash the one I bought from you and the one I bought from Dexter so they could be used as a dual setup with matching firmware.

I've been wondering if the hobbyking xcar 120a works with this firmware. the braking sound is the reason it sits on my desk instead of a board...

The one on the right? Mini USB, not to be confused with micro USB. I flashed it with this:
http://www.rcjuice.com/usb-programming-link-for-fvt-esc-s.html

Not sure how to do it with the card I'd imagine it's possible

I heard that once you go to the board firmware it's extremely difficult to go back. I also heard that the stock firmware is preferable over the e board firmware. But maybe they have changed something since then.

did you get a chance to ride with new firmware?  How does it ride?  I heard one of the other complaints about it is you are no longer able to configure any of the options anymore.

No, waiting on a remote. Should be in the mail today, but the tracking has not been updated for 4 days so Idk if it is lost or not.

It will be very tough to get the original firmware. You will need to contact FVT directly. Personally I do not like the skate firmware on 6s. On 8s - 12s it's ok. Maybe check on Endless-Sphere. I think someone has the original firmware on there.

What didn't you like about the eskate firmware on the 6s?  Acceleration was too slow?

Correct. And the brakes are all or nothing. No progression at all. At least the car Firmware has three levels of breaking.

I tried out the firmware and it flat out does not work. No beeps and the motor does not spin. I tried 2 different esk8 firmware for it and they both didnt work. I then found the stock firmware and am having problems with it..

When I brake at high speeds the brake pulse every 2 seconds or so, and it take for ever to slow down. When going at slow speeds, the brakes are wayyyyy to weak. So PSA, do not change the firmware of the FVT esc.

I regards to brake, what setting do you have for brake strength? I raised mine to 50% and it works good.

I found that the pulsing goes away when you set the brake power to 30% or something lower. They are still strong enough to make me come to a stop at that percent.

Unfortunately I do not. I placed an order and requested they come pre flashed with the esk8 firmware. 

Anyone else looking for the 6s Firmware and Updating software, please visit: https://electric-skateboard.market/downloads

I donâ€™t suppose anyone has a copy of the 160627 firmware on their computer? The links have gone bad and the firmware on the fvt website are no good. 

Thanks
