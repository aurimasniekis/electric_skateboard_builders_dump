Hi! I started making a 10s3p 30Q (so max 60A discharge current) flat battery pack. I used 10 x 0.15mm nickel strips and doubled them on the series connections. Now by looking in the forum the main suggestion would be to add a copper braid wire on top of them. Do you know any convenient source for them in EU? I need it now otherwise I would go for Aliexpress. I also have copper sheet and copper bare to use instead of braid wire. Do you think it is a problem to solder the copper on the nickel stips instead of weld it. I would put a spot of solder iron on both nickel and copper and them solder them together (I hope fast enought to not heat up the cells). Do you any other way?

Thanks a lot

Amazon is always nice.
You can solder the copper braid on the nickel unless you're spot welding copper strips

Do you think I can solder a copper bare on them instead of a braid wire? Like a 12 awg bare.

Yea I don't see a problem with that
Just any copper conductor is fine

Yes you can even use normal silicon wire if you have it, that is what lots of people do to make flexible battery packs

Hey @rey8801 how easy did you find soldering the copper braid? I plan on doing it

personally I find copper braid a bit of a nightmare, it needs a lot of heating to get the solder to flow and that is transferred to the cells.

I have found 10 or 12 awg (depending on your pack config) cable to be easier and cheaper - just strip off the insulation

Ok. Price isnt really an issue, I actually thought it would be easier for some reason. I just like the flexibility of it.

I would be buying tinned copper braid if that makes it any easier to solder?

I found it super ok but with the right tool. I borrowed a industrial soldering iron. Put a drop of iron on Flux and then super easy. That soldering iron is like 400w 4 times the size. So heat up everything super fast. With the normal one it's gonna be a nightmare

Ok. Like using a soldering gun instead might be better? I think I was going to use this anyway. I just bought a TS100 and don't think its very good in this situation

Was really old I can not find the model. Anyhow the tip size was something like this one

20-25€ and should do the job pretty well

OK.

I might aswell use the tools I have since its good for the job.

My plan now is to use 12AWG wire and solder it to nickel, which is  already spot welded to the battery. I wont solder directly onto the cells but in the middle between them

Just need to learn how to be quick with a soldering iron i guess

Get special flux for nickel.
Helped me a lot

12awg is way more easier. It will work.

I have been using this for 3 years and works really well for soldering 10 gauge wires.

you need something with more mass in the tip, the heat can not travel fast enough  through the slim wire you need more something like this i bought one in Aldi for like 30ish$$ and it can serve as a mini radiator in the winter

just scuff up the nickel with some sanding paper, put a bit of flux and solder will stick like crazy

Yeah the tip it came with was a bit small. But I think I can borrow/buy a soldering gun

Something like that will be much better its not that hard to solder 10awg

Soldering is easy. I soldered it to the 18650 battery pcb pad with that tip.

Soldering it do nickel should be easy too? It just needs to be quick since cells can't get that hot

I'll practice until I get good ;)

Scuff it up a bit with some sandpaper, and use flux, it will stick a lot better
