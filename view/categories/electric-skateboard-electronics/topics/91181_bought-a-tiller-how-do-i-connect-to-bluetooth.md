I hear those excuses all the time, but the truth is you're allowing it to happen.  No different than if you were eating baby seal meat, then you would be supporting that, despite not personally killing the baby seal yourself.

The best option is to get a cheap used Android to use for this purpose.

You can probably score a 5-year-old device for minimal cash.

@Thebreadsticks as well i found an S5 while packing and i have no need for it. If you dont want it ill probably throw it in the cheap thread for a few bucks/trade.

Oh shit thats better, I got a super old Virgin Mobile Android and an S3.

The S3 has lineage OS, unlocked and rooted... Actually still kinda holds up vs my S7
