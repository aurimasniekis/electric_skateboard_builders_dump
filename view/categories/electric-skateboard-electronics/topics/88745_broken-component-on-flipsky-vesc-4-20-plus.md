Try contacting after sales service. Vesc is open source so the knowledge should be publicly available. Im sure they will help!

Almost looks like a crystal from the photo, Iâ€™m not sure though it isnâ€™t very clear. Does it have any writing on the top?

It looked like it was  made out of glass   or somthing similar ,with a strip on it. It was so small   so i did happen  to lose  it. I cant seem to get power through  the vesc now  if i spin the wheels by hand i can get the blue led  to light  up but thats it.

A clear picture from above would really help. Maybe you could take one yourself. :smile:

Pretty sure that's a crystal, as to why an antispark would one is beyond me.
Maybe they wanted precision timing for turn on and turn off?

Yes, because the mcu needs the crystal to function.
