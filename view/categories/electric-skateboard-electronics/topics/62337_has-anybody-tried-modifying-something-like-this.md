I bet that won't get mistaken for a gun and get you shot by police.  If only it was white....

I'm from a place where you dont get shot by police sorry I didn't take that into consideration, I'm just looking for a smaller profile for a remote my sparkle died due to a faulty gt2b main board and I have 4 boards and only 2 remotes. I've given up on quanums and I had drop outs from one of those little black Chinese thumb remotes. Has anyone got a attiny working reliably with nrf?
