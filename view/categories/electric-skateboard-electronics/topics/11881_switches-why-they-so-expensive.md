So ive been looks for a couple days now and ive got a switch currently but its a big bulky metal thing. People buy the one from DIY skateboards but its fricking $60! Why cant you use something like this? my batteries only add up to 24v so i dont understand why it wouldnt work? Any help would be appreciated or if anyone knows of any others :) https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01E9PZHRC/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_iw6dybYHCXEZV

If you don't have a soft switch then that switch also won't work as it only a 5amp max most boards are 40-60 amp.

@Charster10 - We're working on a new switch with a built in UBEC most people with VESCs won't need it but doesn't hurt to add it. Should have a few pins for "lights" as well. But they would "always" be on.

The new switch should be cheaper.

@Charster10 the 5 amp limit on that switch is the reason it wouldn't work. But you can use a switch like that to control a [mosfet switch](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eboard-mosfet-switch/5738?source_topic_id=7157) which is pretty easy to make if you can solder. You just need to buy a couple mosfets, a perferated board, a diode, and some resistors.

[/quote]


I'd suggest you get a kit and assemble it yourself if you are on a tight budget.  OR build an anti-spark loop key - @anorak234 linked my old one above.

If you look at Ben's github for his v1.3 anti-spark - price out the BOM.  Then consider the PCB... it's not going to be an inexpensive switch no matter who sells them.  Again, you can buy the parts and assemble it yourself, but you also will need some hot-air rework or reflow skill/tools.  Ben's github has the gerber files and it's a fun little project.  

But if you don't have that skill or tools to reflow SMD - i'd suggest one of the kits from @DeathCookies (especially if you are in Europe), or buy the full switch from @Chaka, or esk8.de, or similar.

For sure.  Loop key is the easiest.

but it isn't as cool as LED backlit power switch...

Ultimately it depends how you want your finished board to look.  When you are comparing it side by side with a production board like Boosted, Marbel, Evolve... sometimes these small finishing touches are nice to have on DIY.  Just think of all the $ you saved vs a production board!  Splurging on a cool on/off switch is personal preference.

All i was trying to point out is that these components aren't cheap, and if someone assembles or carries stock of these - there is a pretty significant investment...  so it's going to cost a bit more (something for their time, rent, CC balance interest...).

The breaker will spark internally, just like when you connect/disconnect the batteries directly.  But they are cheap and easy to replace when they wear out.

They felt overpriced to me too

So I went out and research different designs, selected new components, and generated a BOM at Mouser...  Only then do you realize that the components alone cost $10-20 per board depending on current rating.  The circuit is simple enough that you can make it on blank circuit board, but if you want a PCB that's another $10-15.  Want a nice SPDT switch?  Okay thats another $8.  Now factor in the time that takes to solder and test everything.  I was going to make one myself because of the price.. but in the end it is just not worth it

TLDR; I designed and spec'd out an awesome switch. And still bought a commercially-made one

If you have an anti spark connector and an automotive style circuit breaker switch would that prevent the spark?

That's what I have in my setup.  Just wondering if it's easier on the switch.  This is how I've wired it.

Having the XT90s doesn't change anything from having just a normal connector when you're using a breaker. The spark gets generated on the last thing to get connected, in this case the breaker.

I know there's not much room on these boards but you could use that 5 amp switch to kick on a 60 to 80a relay. Like how cars high amperage circuits run. Not sure how cost effective it would be

Still the same... please don't misinform people.
Anywhere you put a breaker, with our without xt90s, if its the last thing you switch on it will generate a spark inside its casing between the contacts.
The ONLY way to prevent a spark from occurring is either plugin the XT90s last, using an AntiSpark MOSFET switch, or make your own antispark with a momentary switch and a resistor.

When you flick the switch on this one it feels a lot beefier.  This is what I believe @lowGuido uses on a 6s build.  Apparently he has been using for a while without problems.

[/quote]

without surge suppression it will die.  How quickly will depend on your voltage.  

Higher voltage = bigger spark.  
Bigger spark = shorter life.  

If you've ever plugged in a 12s battery w/o ant-spark loop key or similar - they make a pretty significant "pop!" each time.

the simple XT-90s loop key is the easiest and cheapest way to avoid this.  Or buy one of the kits or fully made from vendors here.

running full amps through automotive or even home electrical relays/switches/toggles seems like a recipe for loss of continuity/connection while out on a ride and walking.

you have one right?  crack it open, take pics and share.

Interestingly it says "surge suppression" so wonder if it has an early contact resistor before fully connecting?

crack it open - take pics and let's take a look!

if it has some sort of surge suppression in it - i'd use it for 12-24v as designed!  Dimensions kinda suck at 100mm long and 40mm tall, but might work taken apart to more easily fit...

CHEAP drop in replacement insurance
[/quote]

That's exactly my point - even if it's simple to swap - i don't want to be riding and have it fail - leaving me to walk.  And now with two of them at $5-6 ea - i'd rather roll that $10 into a better switch, or build an anti-spark loop key.  Carrying a spare non anti-spark xt90 is easy insurance to carry when riding (no walking if fails), and if i get an electronic AS switch, i'd have a small length of wire to replace/bypass to ride (with a spark when connecting).  That might also work well for you and @johnny_261 - as insurance if it fails.

@johnny_261 - what setup are you using it with?  (voltage, single/dual, etc.) and what symptoms that it's failing?

Still curious if you can take it apart to make it smaller and easier to install.  I want to keep components high and tight against board, so 40mm sticking down is less ideal.  Shooting for 25-30mm height, so maybe disassembled it'll work better?

I'm using it with a single 6s setup.  On my last ride before replacing it, the switch wouldn't close the circuit at first and power was flickering.  Even when flickering, there wasn't any pops, so it may seem there is some sort of resister in there.

After playing with the switch for a while, I did get a complete circuit and was able to get home, but after that I replaced it with the bigger one.

I think these automotive switches work quite okay! I actually use one which is designed for AC / mains plug, and it's rating is 20A at 115v. 

Though, Im using 6s  - so I assume as someone already told here, that for lower voltages it is more ''easy'' to use these kinds of switches.

I am inspired, A sweet cheap setup might look like a cheap circuit breaker  with a resistor setup like mcgyver dad. Small switch with resistor charges the caps and then switch on the circuit breaker to flow all the high current. No spark. I need to find a high voltage, low current switch.

I think that one is a momentary switch.  It's rated at 50a, so other than that it would as long as you didn't go over 50am draw.

My first thought was that for the XT-90s, or Anti-Spark, to work it has to be in the act of plugging in.  It wont stop all sparks forever, only when it is connected, the application of voltage.

But now that I think about it, I really don't know.  I would ask @Namasaki or @barajabali, maybe they can answer this for you.

Im sure they will post here when they see it, both of them are pretty much DIY powered skateboard super heroes :)

This is what you need.
A high voltage, high current E-switch

but will a toggle switch on the xt90 work?

The XT90 will only work if you plug and unplug it to turn the board off and on. 
If you leave it plugged in and use a switch, you will defeat its purpose and you will get spark in the switch which will fail in short order.

even if the switch is on the very end of the green marked part on the xt90?

If you understand how the XT90 or any anti spark plug works, you would understand why it won't work with a switch.

as @Namasaki said - you will not get the benefit of the XT-90s anti-spark switch if left plugged in.  As it slides in, a resistor contacts and slows the inrush - when fully seated that resistor is bypassed and no anti-spark benefit.  

Similarly the other one pictured w/ the red momentary button above (from @CaptainMerricka)  - you press the button before/during you plugging in the loop key - it completes the circuit with a resistor inline until the loop key is in place, then you release the momentary and the resistor is no longer in the circuit/path.

That help?

I think i was forming the question wrong, I want the switch to act as pulling the xt90 out and in. Because I allready know that for the anti spark function to work you have to do so just as you said<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/d/8d407b5b96236253fa50a344ec6cb320ee9a341f.JPG" width="690" height="475">

That won't work either because you will be bypassing the resistor

You want a loop key

I'd suggest getting a vedder/fechter anti-spark switch for the simplicity you want.

There are some kits and pre-made at a reasonable cost.  You can also get some from [DIYes](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/electric-skateboard-on-off-power-switch/), and [MEB](https://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/120amp-12s-power-switch).

esk8.de too
[chaka's](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/vedder-fechter-anti-spark-switch) as well.

I tried one of those automotive breaker switches on my first build. What a Joke! It wore out in no time. When I took it apart, I could see that there was a lot of arcing going on between the contacts.
There is only 2 ways to eliminate spark
1: using a anti-spark connector like xt90, Plugging and unplugging it to turn the board on and off
2: An electronic soft switch also known as an E-switch
