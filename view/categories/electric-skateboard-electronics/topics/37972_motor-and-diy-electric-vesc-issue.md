Hi, I am making my first build, and I noticed that my motor didn’t fit into the Vesc whatsoever and I don’t know what to do.
Here is the motor

The VESC uses 5mm bullet connectors while that motor uses 4mm connectors. You will have to solder on 5mm connectors to the motor.

You shouldn't buy a motor without a keyway or a flatten edge unless you have experience in mechanical modifications because you need to mail a keyway for the pulley

Make a flat spot in the motor shaft with a Dremel and a sanding wheel. 2 mins work.  I never use keyways, grub screws and loktite. Holds great and much easier to remove.
