In short, I made a mini JST-PH to JST-XH adapter board because my custom li-ion pack has to use JST-PH balance connectors or it won't fit into connector for BMS. From the battery to the adapter board I have set "PIN1" from my Eagle board drawing to be the positive of cell 1. What I don't understand is the balance wiring for the part that plugs into the iCharger 1010B+. I do understand positive goes into positive. The iCharger balance port diagram has the 10th cell as first cell on the positive side. Is their drawing inverse?
