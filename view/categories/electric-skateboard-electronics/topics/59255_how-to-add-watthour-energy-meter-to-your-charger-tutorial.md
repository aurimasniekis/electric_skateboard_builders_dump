Hi, will try to be really brief here.

So the thing is since I started with 6s lipo chargers which had a nice display for showing all the relevant info, it was a real bummer not having any other info, besides volts, when charging with regular CC / CV charger.

The wattmeter / energy meter unit costs just **10 dollars** and is relatively easy to install.

**It shows:**

* Time passed 
* Watthours (*how many 'kilometers/miles' have u already pumped back into battery*)
* Capacity (Ah)
*  Charge Power
* Amps / Volts
* Temperature

**Installation**

As about wiring, since I didnt have sufficient space in my charger, I decided to wire in between my battery charge port and the charger plug.

See pictures for better description.

Of course, u can do the same to any other connector u are having or install meter permanently on the board.

**Benefits:**

With this meter I can confidently know that for 5km range I need to charge about 40minutes

As in **8minutes** about **21wh is charged** into battery. (21wh being average consumtion per km)
