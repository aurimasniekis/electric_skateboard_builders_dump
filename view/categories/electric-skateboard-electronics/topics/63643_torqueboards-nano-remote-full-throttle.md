Hi, i know there is alot of posts about this but i cant find one with my exact problem.(soory if there is a post with the same problem)

When i turn my board on without connecting the remote the motor goes full throttle until i turn it off again.
If i plug out the controller reciver and turn the board on it donst do anything.
if i turn on the board and connect the controller, it works fine. But when i turn off the controller the motor starts throttleing up. 

i tryed everything i cound find on fail safe here on the forum but nothing works.
Does anyone have an idea about what i can do? Thanks

U sure in your ppm settings its on "current no reverse" ?

and you have either just ppm or 
ppm and uart selected if using BT

Sorry, someone will be able to explain this better than me. When you run through the app wizard you set up the parameters of your controller?

About 14 minutes in is what I mean. Pulsewidth?

Your failsafe is set wrong
Pair you remote new with the trigger centered.
After it should be fine

```
Plug in your pairing brige on the receiver.
Remote switched off
Turn on your board
Press the pairing button on the remote and hold it
Than switch on your Remote still holding the pairing button.
Take care that the trigger is in center position while doing this.
Switch off everything 
When you now switch on everything, all should be good

One thing I could imagine it could be too.
Look in your ppm settings.
Is there some break current defined in case of signal loss?
Usually it would only break but look if there is written 0a
