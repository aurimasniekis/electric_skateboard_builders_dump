If I was going  to make plug and play bluetooth adapters(for the phone apps) would there be an interesst in them? I've made 10 for people around here trying to expand. Thinking around 15-20$ with 7pin jst and 2inches of wire. Works great with vesc connect.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/8/28be0875f9878b901167d43a0dc1e7e77bd83854.png" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/a/0a1445d98841f2db7e5dfa8421ee379e532b3dce.png" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/4/54ae531914444cb54c4ed4cdd1052e5babf1e069.png" width="281" height="500">
