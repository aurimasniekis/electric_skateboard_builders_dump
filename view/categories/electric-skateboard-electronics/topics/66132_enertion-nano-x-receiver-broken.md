Hey guys,

The receiver of my nano x is broken? No lights no nothing anymore. I tried to bind my nano x with a hobby king 2.4ghz receiver but that didn't work.

Does anyone now a receiver which I can vind with the nano x?

Thanks

TB nano remote uses the same receiver as the nano x collections/remote-controller/products/2-4ghz-nano-receiver
