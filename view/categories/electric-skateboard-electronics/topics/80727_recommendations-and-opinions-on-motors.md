What recommendations do you guys have for a cheap and reliable motor?  I'm trying to make a dual motor longboard on budget before spring semester starts.  My target is top speed 25mph and initial acceleraton 3m/s^2.  I'm probably using a dual 50A continuous 150A burst ESC with a 6s battery (its all I can charge at the moment)

Requirements...
- functional at 6s
- $75 or less
- 60mm or less (length including end bearing but excluding shaft)
- high torque or kv (real kv * Nm >= 750)
- 50A or less continuous draw (at 22.2V)
- available now

Preferences...
- sealed (or at least gravel proof)
- sensored
- easily obtained in eastern US
- functional up to 10s or 12s

Any kv from 150 to 450 is fine (I'm getting a variety #25 sprocket set)

Any opinions on the following motors are greatly appreciated as well!

I've looked at...
- Sk8 DIYeBoards 6354 180kv: it looks great but I've heard bad things about DIYeBoards
- Build Kit Boards 6354 208kv: sealed and sensored but there is no torque rating although I think its high
- DIY Electric Skateboard Torque Boards 6355 260kv: the torque is really low for the kv but it seems designed for 6s
- FlipSky 6354 190kv: it looks perfect but I hear a lot about the magnets coming lose and cutting out when braking
- Hobby King Turnigy SK3 5055 430kv: its made for 6s but its weak AF

If you have motors in good condition that qualify for sale please send me the market link

the only thing i can attest for are the motors. All the other stuff has been tested by fourm members. i have only used their motors and they are rock solid. you can search the fourm for what people think about the other stuff. But the motors are bangin.

If you get a cheap motor and do a sealing treatment it should make it much more reliable.

I also find if you dig enough you discover most are sister companies or owned by the same umbrella corp

bestech and Li tech (same) 

I don't think anyone is knocking rebranding or having a higher quality motor produced. It's charging too much for them.......
