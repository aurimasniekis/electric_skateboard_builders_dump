I’ve been using the nano remote for a while, and there are all of these extra buttons. Is there any way to program speed modes to them, and if not what are they for?

i know one is for pairing, and the other ones for useless stuff..

no way to program speed modes onto them i don't think

edit: thought you already knew about slow/fast cause most remotes say it.

seemed like you wanted to add more then 2 speed modes which was weird.

Why do you need the extra speed modes when there is actually 2, a low power and high power setting. The settings in between are kinda useless anyway ....

There must be a switch where you can change between two modes![image|379x500](upload://epmJK9ioBL9dC1a5xWiFtHI9add.jpeg) https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/7/67d89ed6aa6bef14390030b3d1c8e43cd7c04402.jpg

Thanks man! Any idea how to set up the reverse function? I’ve tried holding in the past and it didn’t work.
