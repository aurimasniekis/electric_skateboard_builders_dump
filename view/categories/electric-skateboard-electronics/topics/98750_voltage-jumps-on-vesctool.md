I've got a flipsky vesc6.6 in my board. Everything runs great, using the vesctool to communicate with the board. Only issue is that my voltage reading jumps up and down rapidly by about 1v, in 0.1v increments when using the app (both usb via computer and bluetooth) Is there any way to smooth this reading out?
