My motor goes wide open when the 2.4 GHz. mini trigger on switch gets turned off or the battery is removed. Are these like power failure? Receiver is plugged into slot 2 of the receiver. Is there a failsafe position for the mini remote and receiver?

You need to set your failsafe on the receiver.

Thanks for the reply and I appreciate the help. I'm new at all this so how do I go about setting the failsafe?

It depends on the remote you're using, search the forum, there's plenty posts about it.
