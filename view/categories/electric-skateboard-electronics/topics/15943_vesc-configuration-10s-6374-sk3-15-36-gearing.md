Hello,
Maybe you have some suggestions on some of the limits?
My setup:
10s, sk3 6374, 16/36 gearing, 80mm wheels

```
Set the maximum input voltage to 57V (don't ask).
If you have a Li-Ion Battery set the battery cutoff start to 30 and the cutoff end to 28 and if you have a Lipo Battery set the  cutoff start to 36 and the cutoff end to 34. Or more aggressive to 35 and 33. If you want more power at lower speeds set the motor max to 70 or 80.
The ERPM limit should be set to 60000 and -60000. But with a 12S you won't reach those speeds. But with 60000 you are on the safe side.
Everything else looks good if you have a single drive.

If you have a single drive disable the "Send status over CAN" in the General Tab. If you have dual only activate it for the slave when the two VESCs are connected via CAN.

Please also post the PPM Tab

Thank you. So everything else is ok.

Sorry i meant with 10S you won't reach those speeds as long as your motors kv is not higher than 190kv. With 12S you could only reach it on the bench but not when you ride it. Set it to max 60000 and min -60000 and you will be safe.

-12 battery min is fine.
-40 motor min also. If you want more brake power you can raise the motor min to even -80. You need to find out by yourself what suites you. I have -60 on my single.

And if you like to have more power then you can go up to 80 motor max and 60 battery max. But that is already a lot for your belts.

You can sumarize it to 
Motor Max = Power at low speed
Battery Max = Total Power or Power at high speed
Motor Min = Brake power at mid to low speed
Battery Min = Brake power at high speed

@Ackmaniac That's a great summary it took me a lot of trial and error to sort these values out when I got my first VESC!

Sorry for jumping in on this thread :D 

Lets say i have a 10s2p with Samsung 30Q cells ... They have a discharge of 15A (some may say 20A). Does that mean for me that I should not set my Motor Max, Min and Battery Max to more than 30A (or 40A)?

Cheers!

Have the same pack and run it with a 6734 singel on my commuter board.

got those values atm:

Motor Max: 50a
Batt max: 40a
Motor min: -50a (this is purely how you want the brakes to feel)

Hey @michichopf,

what i don't quite understand is that if you limit your Battery Max to 40A, the Motor Max will never exceed the 40A right? Even though its set to 50A? Those two values should act like a bottle neck to each other right?
```

well as far as I would say it and take that with a gran of salt:
you wont ever max out your motor a at higher speeds, thats mostly for acceleration at lower speeds. So motor max is more how much he can pull for start up and acceleration.

your Battery A is more of a bottleneck how much the set up can draw during higher speeds ( top speed).

So I usually played around with settings on the safer side, then I asked poeple who ran the same setup with expertise in the vesc area and copied theirs. I am more of a rider (downhill/esk8) than I am a builder, grabted I did few DIY but allways sought after confirmation from better informed individuals. sorry .(

But so just hypothetically assuming youd go full acceleration at very low speed, it would try to pull 50A for your 10S2P but I am hoping that the Battery Max will prevent it from actually drawing that much, as it would damage the batteries .... ?

So youre thinking it might actually draw 50A even though the Battery Max is set to 40A? Thats quite frightening :D

Motor amps can be higher then battery amps during certain situations. If you set your battery max to 40amps the max amps that can be pulled from battery is 40amps.There are many times on my single drive ( 10s_6374_16/36_83mm wheels ) when my battery is pulling lower amps then what my motor is pulling. Here is an example. You can see the motor is pulling more amps then the battery. This is 40amps max battery and I think 50 or 60 amps max motor ( 1500w max settings in ack software)

You set you battery max to 40amps the vesc should never hypothetically go over 40 amps with battery.

OK. So please can someone explain to me how the Motor can draw more current than the Battery is delivering? I guess that is where I am confused. I must be fundamentally misunderstanding some of the concepts here :D

If my motor is max rated at 50a can I do more than (I guess technically less than) -50a? Say -60a?

Your battery is rated for 5A max discharge and 2.5A max continuous charge. I mostly go 50 higher in charge current. So you can use 10A max battery and 7.5A min battery.
Not really great. So finally you have the wrong battery in i too small configuration.

sorry for digging out,

my brakes are really weak at high speeds, when im like going 45 - 60 km/h. I have a **12S4P w/ 30Q**. Afaik the max. charge for these types is: 3A, so splitted up to 2 VESC (dual) it would be around 6A battery min per VESC. I have it around -7.5a for each one, totaling 15A. How "bad" can it be raising these numbers to, lets say about 10 or even 15A per VESC to get more braking power (really ned it, im relatively heavy with 90kg mass)? 
Since the charging is not continuously, the battery's should not get damaged, or am i wrong?

I have 12S4P 30q as well and I use - 12A on each vesc. Cells are rated for 4A max continuous charge but I also think that short burst will not harm them. But I am not a battery engineer. But better the battery's die than me.
