Hello fellow e-boarders, 
Most car escs come with a switch (for example Torque's 6s esc). Is it possible to replace that switch with something easier on the eyes (like this: http://www.ebay.com/itm/16mm-12V-Car-Silver-Aluminum-LED-Power-Push-Button-Metal-ON-OFF-Switch-Latching-/311438581192?hash=item48832f9dc8:g:qKUAAOSwgQ9V6Xl5) without the need for additional parts?
```

you can do exactly that with one of the DIY kits. its documented pretty well on this forum if you search a bit.

I am aware of that kit, but can it be done without it? Perhaps the esc steps down the voltage on the switch? Can anyone test it with a multimeter?

oh, you just want to pull out the switch on the ESC and replace it? sure. any switch so long as its not momentary should do that.

however I'd recommend a separate power switch to the one on the ESC. for safety.

is it ok to tap into the esc power switch?

Its ok. But I prefer to leqve the ESC switch on always and then use a circuit breaker to switch and isolate the battery at the same time.

is an xt60 key a good idea? I've seen some people do that on es it seems an easy but affective way

yeah thats a good way to do it. even better to use the anti spark XT90.

Red and white start the esc, black and white is for programming mode (on the fvt120). I did this a while back and it worked. Thought it'd be useful to post here.

I doubt this. Black is most probably ground, red + and white the data line (which acts as some sort of second ground if you cut black.

I verified this with a multimeter, and it works on my setup. Why are you doubting all of my posts today?

Lol - was not intentional. I don't pay attention to who posts stuff but only react to the actual post.
I just have the same setup on my ESC and color coding is usually somewhat defined with black almost always being ground and red +. But if it is like that on your ESC then fine - on mine it is not.
Something to keep in mind that there might be different setups out there.

I'm talking about the FVT120. Other escs may have a different power switch implementation.

that link no longer shows the "how to" instructions. Can someone post a how to for the proper wiring and schematic for the push button power switch that is going to be installed between the battery pack and the ESC?

for instance my esc has two reds and a white. how would I add a switch that has red black green yellow and blue?
