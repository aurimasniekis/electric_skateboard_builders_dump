I ordered the 737g a while ago cause voltlog did a good video on it, it finally arrived, but I noticed a fatal error, I got the 220v version instead of the 110v I do have power converters so it's not the end of the world, but would anyone happen to know what to do to rewire the thing for 110v? From what I can see in the voltlog vid, there's a pcb trace on the transformer that might be the selector, just thought I'd ask before going all in on voiding the warranty.

Better yet, if someone with the 110v version can post a pic of the wires going into the transformer and the main board, that would give me a good clue.

It is convertible, just gotta solder it like so, works just like before.![IMG_0045|666x500](upload://zrTLC7eE8SEY0aRd4V40cGlibTO.jpeg)
