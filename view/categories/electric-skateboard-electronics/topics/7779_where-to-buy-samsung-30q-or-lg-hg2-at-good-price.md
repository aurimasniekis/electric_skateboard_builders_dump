If you are in US, liion warehouse is apparently good. @Airmacx was it you that bought cells from FastTech?

Yeah, got here in less than a week from  the US. I'm not sure if any are dead though since I don't have the tools to or know how to. Still need to find someone who can build me a pack. A company in Sydney said they'd do it, but it's been a month since I got a reply.

I got mine for about $4 each -- US based and free shipping.  I only ordered 50 which is low quantity but adequate for building a 12s4p.

Ordered this morning from http://www.batteryjunction.com/  -- I got the 10% off coupon code. Total price delivered by UPS saver (4-7 day) was $204.75
