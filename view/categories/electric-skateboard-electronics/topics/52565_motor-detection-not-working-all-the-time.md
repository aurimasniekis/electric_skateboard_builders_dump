hey guys 

I'm working on a project of e-bikes 
ordered parts everything needed  for a  ebike  things like battery motors and all 

BUT'

on youtube and other places i found that focbox is the best esc in the market so i ordered just to make 1 prototype 

n OMG its not able to run the motor at all :triumph:
 
I'm not able to do a motor detection, 
In terminal no faults  
then tried foc ( r = 0 ) :disappointed:

motor run's cheap ESC but not on foc  even doe being so expensive
guys plz help invest a lot of money in this prototype

Soo

Are you running the stock vesc tool(3.***) On a focbox. Or are you running 2.*** Firmware?

If it's the first... You'll never get a detection.. you'll need ackmaniac 3.100 or go back to 2.*** Firmware.

```
*Show photographs of your wiring
*Provide a proper description of what you have done, what firmware you are using, if the motor reacts at all

```
if the motor is big or old, they have high resistance that requires more currents. I believe bike motor is 80% or less efficiency.

just up D value by 0.01 untill u find the detection.
do not just put 0.10 like that it mass up emf coupling and u will burn something. slowly up the value.
this is how I did with troublesome detection
