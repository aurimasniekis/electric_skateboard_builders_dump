So I was replacing my controller and I had to calibrate it using the vesc tool. A pop up said the tool had an update. So I installed the new version and reset everything. I set it all up the exact way it was before, but I'm getting an electronic buzzing. I was riding earlier in the day and I didn't have this noise, but I heard it once I updated it. Is anyone else having this problem? Or did my new motor happen to go bad at the same time I updated the tool and did the detection run again?
