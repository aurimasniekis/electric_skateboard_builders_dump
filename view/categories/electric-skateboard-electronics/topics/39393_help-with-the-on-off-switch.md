What specifications does an On/Off switch need to be usable in an electric skateboard?
for instance:
https://www.banggood.com/DC-12V-12mm-4-Pin-Momentary-Switch-Led-Light-Metal-Push-Button-Waterproof-Switch-p-1196605.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN
I will use 2x 3s 5000mAh 20c zippy's and a motor which can draw at peak 60Amps

If this switch does not work, can you suggest a something to turn the board on and off? (disconnect the batteries) Thank you!

There's plenty of posts on this if you search around (and this is a pretty beginner topic IMO), but your going to need an antispark mosfet switch to use that momentary switch. 

http://www.antisparkheaven.com/ has a bunch of good ones.

```
we mostly use **XT-90 Antispark** connectors cause they’re cheap and reliable

The XT-90 antispark is much cheaper, but the mosfet switch is "cleaner" all you have is a button instead of a connector sticking out the side of your board.

E-switches are cool but finding one that is reliable is difficult.

If you dont have an eswitch you have only one option for the "on off switch" and that's XT90 or something like that
If you have an e switch see how many volts does it use for the buttons light usually 5 or 12 everything else doesn't matter
