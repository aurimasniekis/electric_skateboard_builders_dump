Maybe @trampa can help you and explain why you canÂ´t upload the newest FW.

One side note. Take care about your phase wires here:

Probably bootloader missing. Third party hardware often comes without bootloader. You can re-flash the bootloader with VESC-Tool. If that doesn't work you can flash the ESC via SWD, using another VESC based ESC as a programmer. This is a new feature.

If you flash via SWD please connect  GND, IO, CLK and do not spin up the motor while ESCs are connected via SWD.

```
Interconnect two ESC via SWD (IO, CLK; GND). Do not interconnect VCC! Use short cables (6cm)
Connect to the working ESC and go to the SWD PROG tab. You will get relevant FW listed, which you can select. Choose correct FW (e.g. 410,411,412 FW for Hw 4.12). Click Upload.
