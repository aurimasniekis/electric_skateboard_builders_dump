I just completed this build here - [12s4p - dual focbox - dual 6374 190kv](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/name-coming-soon-ly-evo-tb-218-dual-6374-190kv-12s4p-30q-dual-focbox-metr/)

It connects to the Ackmaniac ESC Tool via a Metr Pro module. I have configured it in FOC Sensored mode, and the motors are spinning perfectly. Does anyone have any recommended changes I should make to the motor and app configs below before I let this thing move me around the streets? Thanks to anybody that wants to help!

I realize this is a lot of screenshots to dump here. Please let me know if there is a simpler or cleaner way to do this!

Does anybody see any obvious changes that should be made? I think it's all probably OK, but it would be cool is someone with more experience had a look at it too.

looks good so far.
you set the max erpm to 60000
the bat cut off is right
the motor and battery max min values seam ok too ( just donÂ´t break down a 3km hill with -20a batt min ;) )
if motor detection was running well and your remote adjusted properly (inclusive fail save) than give it a go.

Thank you for looking over the settings. If I decide to head west toward the beach, I'll have to go down a hill for about a mile. The elevation is a couple hundred feet.  For those situations, should I change the battery to -10a?
