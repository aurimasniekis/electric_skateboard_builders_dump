Hey guys! I'm having issues with my Nyko Kama receiver (go figure). The hookup is correct to the vesc and the controller still connects, but there seems to be no control signal going from the receiver to the vesc. Though it's connected. It worked for a while, but one of the wires got disconnected so I had to resolver it-fixed. Same thing happened-not fixed.  I've soldered, resoldered, cleaned, and resoldered to no avail. Even made sure the vesc didn't reset itself through the BLDC tool. Please help.
