Recently, my anti spark switch from Mboards (Version 1) has stopped working. I worked with my 10s5p battery 3s2p battery and now without any changes has stopped working, I know itâ€™s not any of the connections because I have checked those but it still doesnâ€™t work. Any ideas why it doesnâ€™t work and if thereâ€™s any ways to fix it?

Don't use it. It sounds fucked. Unless you get one of the one potentially fully functional and reliable anti spark switch for $$, just wire in a loop key and don't deal with antispark switches being a pain. Mine worked for a good 10 months before ðŸ’© ing out, still not worth it.

Do a keyloop. Way more reliable. Here [How to](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-anti-spark-xt-90s-loop-key/204)

Just removed one from a board LHB made after a couple of weeks. I don't like them either. Use a loop key or a BMS with eswitch built in

You were unlucky.  All my luna/mboards failed in the on position so no need to remove just rely on loop key.  Moral.  most antisparks suck big hairy balls.
