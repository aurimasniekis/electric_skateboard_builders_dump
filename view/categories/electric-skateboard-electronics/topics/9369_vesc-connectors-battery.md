A lot of people use different things. Which one do you have/like to use with your VESC? (connectors going to your battery , not motor)

Hi so I am building my first electric skateboard and I have a few questions. First so I have the battery (http://www.ebay.com/itm/222573838441) and I want to know how I connect it to the VESC and then to the motor. I think I need a VESC male to male connector for the 2.4 ghz remote but do I need connectors from the battery to the VESC and then the VESC to the motor? Thanks for your help!
