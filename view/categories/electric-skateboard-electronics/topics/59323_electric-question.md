It really depends on the weight and hill grade gearing etc. 30q rated 15a cont so 105amp is ur safe batt max. u need vesc monitor app with the bt module to find out really.

sure they can. at 12s more than enough. 12 gage hold more than 100amp at 10s

10AWG can definitely handle 100a for a few seconds. cruising current for most of us is about 5a
