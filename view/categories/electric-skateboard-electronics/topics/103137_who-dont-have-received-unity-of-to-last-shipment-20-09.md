Well, everyone who buys from Enertion has that Problem. Getting ghosted is normal for them too. 

With 3 months in you are still early. People waited over a year for their stuff.

Well..they don't have any money to refund you. Paypal is your best bet if you want to opt out.

you can now buy them on amazon with 2 day shipping. This is your best bet as enertion is restructuring and the customer service is almost non existent.
