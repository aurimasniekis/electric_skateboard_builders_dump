I'm a beginner and want to build a 2WD skateboard. Any good ideas of the esc, motor, remote, desk and truck choices. I see huge promotions on Flipsky https//:flipsky.net now. Most of people think they are good with reasonable price. Hope can be fine. Or any other good advices? Thanks a billion.

Look at someone’s else’s build

Just search up build log/thread and see how much their parts cost

Take note build kit board prices in US$ even when you choose Au$. For a moment I was thinking Im getting a kit for 800 Au$. But when you go to the basket it applies the exchange rate
