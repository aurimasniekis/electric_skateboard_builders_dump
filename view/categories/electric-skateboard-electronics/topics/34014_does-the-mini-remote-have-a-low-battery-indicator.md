I'm afraid my remote will run out of battery while I'm riding downhill, my footbraking needs practice so right now I'm 100% reliant on motor brakes.

I've searched the forum and apparently the mini remote's red led will blink, whether or not that is due to bad signal or low battery seems to be up for debate. Does anyone know for sure?

Donâ€™t go fast downhill ðŸ˜‰

I don't but if my remote suddenly cuts out and I don't have brakes, I would probably end up using my face instead. 
Right now I take the batteries out every other ride to check their voltages and its a pain. 
It'd be nice to know if the red led is in fact  an indicator for low battery so i wouldn't have to worry about this. 
I also really like the remote, and would prefer not to switch to another one.

My suggestion was not to go downhill at a speed faster than you could jump and run off.  @JLabs can probably answer your question though

Not too sure about the mini but my TB nano will blink when it's low. Charged for about 20 min to verify and it stopped blinking.

The mini remote doesn't run on batteries. They're just a decoy. 
There is a nuclear reactor inside as the batteries never run down.Either that or elves come in and replace the batteries when I'm in bed. 
I've left mine on countless times overnight and no problems.

hah.. funny side story @bigben

Though i have witness that end of battery life u will experience more frequent cutouts.. so you cant really rely on the flashing led to 'know' that you soon need to replace the batteries (at least this was my experience)..

Though i think if youre really into knowing the state of charge of remote, u can implement small volt meter to see the voltage reading.
