Curious if anyone knows if anyone making custom enclosures for ol flippys esc's? More specifically the 4.20 dual. 

 My set up for it atm is workable. But I was thinking about something similar to the focbox enclosure, can't seem to find anything with the ol Google fu. So thought I'd give it a go here. 

Thanks

maybe try asking on the "wanted cheap/free" thread if someone can 3d print one that you design

i bet someone would see and be happy to do it

i would, but i only have black PLA atm
