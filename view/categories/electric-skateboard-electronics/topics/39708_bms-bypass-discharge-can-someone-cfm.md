Looks ok to me. 
Just make sure the charge port wires and the negative balance wire going from battery 1 to the B- pad on the bms can handle the charge current that you’ll be using. 
Also be aware of regen voltage going straight into the battery and avoid prolonged  braking with a full battery.

Yes because the negative balance wire is connected to the same tab on the battery as the main negative wire.
It’s just the balance wires are usually light gauge for low current
