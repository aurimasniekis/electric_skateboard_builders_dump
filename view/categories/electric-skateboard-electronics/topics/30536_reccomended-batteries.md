@darkkevind 

Hi! After about a month of riding on my new board, I had many people telling me that I should upgrade my batteries. However I do not have any knowledge on batteries.

I am currently running two 5000 mah 3s1p 20c lipo batteries. I want to understand what these numbers mean in terms of distance or how fast the board will go. I want to increase my speed while maintaining my distance. Please let me know if two 5000 mah 6s 25 c lipos connected in series would work, or if I need more c rating to up my speed etc.


Here are my parts:

6355 190kv motor from diyelectricskateboard (diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv/)

TORQUE ESC VESC Â® BLDC Electronic Speed Controller diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/

TorqueBoards 2.4ghz Nano Remote Controlle diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-2-4ghz-nano-remote-controller/





Thank you in advance!

Simple add more lipos in series or change to li ion cells

Yes, what @willpark16 said. You need more cells in series to up the voltage which will in turn up your top speed.

However, you must check your motor can handle the extra voltage by checking the specs. 12s (12 x 4.2v = 50.4) may be too much for it.

Would you reccomend li-ion or lipo?

Here are my motors max:
Max Power: 2500 Watts
Max Amps: 80 Amps
Max Volts: 12S

Could you tell me if a 5000 mah 6s 25 c lipo would work. Also what does c rating and mah do. Sorry for all the questions.

I'd go with Li-po for cost, and AMP output if you're happy charging the batteries individually. You could get a BMS for them if  you want to charge them all together.

I'd go for Li-ion for longevity, safety and ease of charging (through just a power brick by using a BMS). They're quite a bit more expensive than Li-po's though!

Ok, I will stick to lipo. As for the max for the motor will the other specs do?

Here are my motors max:
Max Power: 2500 Watts
Max Amps: 80 Amps
Max Volts: 12S\

In addition I am using a parralel charger for my lipos

Yes, your motor is fine for 12s

OK, by the way, thank you for all your help on this topic and all my other topics.

Also, what c rating and mah should I get, and what do they mean.

Li ion my friends

I think that in my case, a lipo is better, I have all wires needed and a lipo charger already.

I found this on hobbyking https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-compact-5000mah-6s-25c-lipo-pack.html, it seemed good. Is this ok, if so what kind of cables are those red and black ones, they look like bullet connectors. Thank you for your help.

It says they are 5.5 bullet connectors on the description page. I've read (but not seen / experienced) issues with 190kv and 12s (eRPM errors only at top speed). I'm running 10s and 190kv with zero issues.

How fast are you able to go on your current setup, also what is your mah and c rating.

I'm running 10s1p with 5000mAh, 20c for each battery (5s). I probably should've gone with a higher C rating, but I live in a flat area and I weigh 160 lbs.

I've been able to get my board to 20+ mph pretty easily (not full throttle) and I'm using Kegels with 16/36 gearing. My build:

What does the c rating do, will it affect speed or distance?

tldr it's the max current you can pull out of your batteries. There's a bunch of threads on this forum about it, I'd look it up

OK, and i'm guessing that your batteries have 5.5 bullet plugs? If so, which connector are you using to have them in series.
```

4mm bullets. I replaced them with XT90 (overkill) and made my own XT90 series connector with a XT90s switch.

So do you have 5.5 mm bullet connectors or the 4 mm bullet connectors? Thanks for all the help so far

no prob, are you planning on staying with 6s or do you wanna go bigger (10/12s)? Also you should spend some more time looking up RC / electronics basics before you start building ;)

I think I am going to go with two 4000 mah 5s 30c lipo batteries connected in series. Also could you explain what the batteries c rating does in terms of speed, distance, safety or anything else it may affect. 

Thanks!

again there's info on that already on this forum and beyond. Just do a google search, I'm feeling like a broken record! :sweat_smile:

If you're feeling lazy it's how much the battery will support a continuous current draw. In your example, you'll have 4000mah * 30C -> 4 * 30 -> 120A continuous, which should be fine.

Poor nikolas just wants to know what the c rating does. I respect your patients. Me on the other hand feel like pulling my hair out because of this electronic stuff.
