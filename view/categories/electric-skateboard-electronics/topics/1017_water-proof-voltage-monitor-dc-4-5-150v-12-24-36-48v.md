Has anyone used one of these on a build? I bought a few and they seem solid, but I'm unsure about the best way to wire then in. They come with 4 spots to wire to, but only 2 wires. Pictures on Amazon show the wires in different spots than how I received them.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/dc9273eadf8b8d88f1f859ef66b155d44fdc03e2.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f1a906c28ff3efba16ae5187ab05c4f4a3fbb01d.jpg" width="689" height="390">

I have that same one (in green). I'm probably going to splice it in at the main power plug so I can monitor the total volts. It's really bright lol. Not sure what the second set of connections are for so I taped them up.

Ok so you left the wires on as they were shipped?

Yep, had them hooked up to my lipos at 12s and it worked as expected.

Cool! I just wanted to be sure before I soldered anything. It worked.
