10s4p battery won't last that long

Don't worry. It will.[quote="pehra564, post:1, topic:27575"]
36V 37V 42V 10S 45A Lithium ion Li-ion Li-Po LiPo Polymer Battery BMS PCB System...

Go with this one.

36v 2000mah Sealed Lead Acid Battery Charger with XLR Connector Us Plug and Green and Red Led Display

Im not sure how I feel about this charger. It says 36v, not 42. Find a 42v 2A laptop charger for cheap on eBay.

10s4p battery pack in parallel count as a 10s8p battery pack
[/quote]

Yes... but almost certainly not nessecary. Unless you plan on going for a 40 mile ride, you don't need this. 10s4p will be good.


As for your diagram.. a few problems. First, please label P- and B- on your BMS so we can know if you are doing it right. Also, Im not sure what charge display you are using but most voltmeters only attach to one + and one -. Not 2. Also better make that "xt90 switch" into an "XT90-S switch".

190kv is low enough for a direct drive setup

No, not quite low enough.

Uhhhh I'm almost certain this won't work but who knows, maybe do it for science :wink:.

GL!

Your understanding of batteries and how they work needs some work so I think u should read some more but to answer ur original question that setup should work

Edit ur motor pulley teeth are too high
