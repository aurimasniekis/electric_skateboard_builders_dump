Just curious. What are the max Amps you have pulled from your battery? Could be any Chemistry, Motors, Drive type, or Vesc.
Whats the most you have seen??

I haven't kept very good record, but the most I've recorded is 33 amps.

I run  a 60A BMS most I have seen is 55A

Same as saturn tho I haven't paid much attention

I recommend to watch this videos with live data.

Probably one of the highest current drawn on an esk8

On my hill-climb tests, which I perform on Hill St. In San Diego (21-22% grade), i have recorded as much as 85 battery amps. But my motors breath easy on a 15/44t drive ratio. However, this is almost never at WOT, because it's _REALLY_ scary. As my lipos are aging, im seeing a voltage drop of 3.7v at that current on a 12s pack (about 0.31 v/c).

On full acceleration from standstill I've seen 76A on battery amps ðŸ‘¹

Some testing with too many amps. 

Motor 
120
-60
 
Battery
60
-30

Dual 6374 on escapes fw3.38. 12s6p 30q. 

https://metr.at/r/L2FVo

I have since dialed it down to 80 motor amps. I canâ€™t trust 120 and even 100 because it gives me drv faults at random.

120 motor amps...... Why?
Do you see the 10V sag in your voltage when hits 240A. All you are doing is forcing drv faults and overheating your motors.

My max. was 108A on the battery for a brief second with my  2WD EMTB packing a 10S8P 30Q. On a short but stong incline with very low tire preasure, on dirt in the woods.

Usually I don't see more than 60A on regular rides.

When you get a drv fault does it cut power?

Like they said. It will cut off and reset.

I can see your running 12s. How many Ah is your pack and what chemistry?

Samsung 30q. 

3x12x6x3,6 = 777,6 

or

3x12x6x4.2 = 907,2

Whats your average range?

Im thinking of going either 12s5p or 12s6p but I cant decide, its gonna be a dual 170kv 1:6.25 165mm+ pneumie build

Too soon to tell. 

With the cold temps on multiple days I got a max of 39km. I had to call a taxi (aka wife) to get home for the last few km. 

I do ride pretty fast. Mostly above 40-45 kph when possible. 

This one was in the rain on a full charge. Didnâ€™t make it home either since both belts snapped.

You asked for Ah right, so a 6p pack of 30q should be

6 x 3000mAh = 18Ah

Chemistry is NCA

I wouldn't think a 12s6p 30q pack would sag that much.

Well it wouldnâ€™t if youâ€™d went for lower amp settings which apparently most people ride with. I just really like my punch nice and spicy.

Donâ€™t forget Iâ€™m also riding in cold 5C weather which really makes a big difference.

Ah ya the cold will do it. I ride at 100 motor amps on my unity. I love the punch as well and would take more if I could get it.

Any Metr data that shows you doing some high speed pulls on a warm day? 

I cant decide between 30q or 30t or 40t

I would pay out the wazoo for 40t or even 30t but its about building my final (LOL, ok) build, and I want it to be perfect*

*very minimal voltage sag, at least 20mi range on pneumies at 75% throttle, and a top speed of 25mph(limited by the esc, I dont want to kill myself)

Unfortunately not. My first and second rides on this build it was around 1C outside. 

https://metr.at/r/INxWh

https://metr.at/r/PTuRT

Itâ€™s my understanding lipo will give you minimal sag but until I have tried them out I wonâ€™t trust that. More p on li ion should give you less sag too but since I also use a lot more power with more it ends up being more sag than on a 2 p setup or equivalent.
