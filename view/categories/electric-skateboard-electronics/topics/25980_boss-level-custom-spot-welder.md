I just got a couple days ago a custom spot welder. It has tons of potential so i want to share this info with the community.
I live in a small house, we are swimming on electric and painting stuff so i can't afford to have big machines. I looked for small custom spot welders on the net: microwave, car battery, supercapacitors.... all of them too big or not what i was aiming for. Then i found this welder. It's not a new device, was created time ago, since it is interesting many guys tried to buy it and the creator sold a few in his area but refused for a long time to ship overseas, i guess it's looong time consuming for a low profit.
 People insisted so recently he opened his hands to the world and i managed to get one for me. I'll make a small review.

It's made out of arduino custom shields. The creator is a korean genius named Aulakiria. He did many prototypes, ac powered...dremel size...this is the final item.
It's powered by a 3s lipo, YES! lipo hates being shorted but he managed to limit the short to 16ms so no damage at all. The size is minimal 4x3x8 cm.
[img]https://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/19/70/63/50/20170610.jpg[/img]
This is how i got it. The module, a pen, a momentary switch for manual use and a hakko solder iron (It solders  as well) The shipping was incredibly fast 7 days from korea.
[img]https://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/19/70/63/50/20170611.jpg[/img]
He sent me as a courtesy some nickel strips and the matching xt90 connector for the lipo.
[img]https://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/19/70/63/50/20170612.jpg[/img]
everything fits inside this small box. PERFECT! my dream size.
All you need is a 3s lipo to use it. Just solder the xt90 and you are done. Aulakiria recommends top lipos, above 40c. It will work with whatever you have but the better the lipo the better the welds. He even did the demos with crappy b grade 25c to prove it.
[img]https://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/19/70/63/50/b_grad10.jpg[/img]
It has top quality IFR1404 mosfet manufactured in Korea and Taiwan. He recommends to keep the mosfet under 50º celsius. The shield has a port for a 5v fan. The left side is negative and the right side is positive.
[img]https://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/19/70/63/50/fan10.jpg[/img]
I installed a fan but totally failed. The temperature was always high, the welder stops automatically to avoid damage. 
So annoying! My country is VERY HOT these days.
[img]https://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/19/70/63/50/tpol10.jpg[/img]

Well...maybe not that hot but very hot anyway so i installed some heat sinks on the plate.

[img]https://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/19/70/63/50/20170616.jpg[/img]
and two 12 volt fans.The temperature never goes above 30º celsius now.
[img]https://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/19/70/63/50/20170617.jpg[/img]
 In normal conditions any 5v will do a perfect performance. If you have a soft weather there's no need to mod.
I did a small video to show the performance:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCa2QP1jjBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCa2QP1jjBE)

To use the hakko solder you need a power supply 12-35v. 19+prefered.  Any laptop power supply will do.

This is Aulakiria himself using the iron:
 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA7HLQKWx88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA7HLQKWx88)Aulakiria translated the menu so we can read it. It's easy to play.

The welding times are usually:
for nickel strips
0.1   1.4ms
0.15    4ms
0.20    7ms
The machine is copper welding capable but requires the use of 4s lipo. The use of copper for skateboards packs is unnecessary and the intense use of 4s lipo may damage the machine. 
The use of 3s only is advised as 4s may be dangerous for both machine and yourself.
copper times are:
0.1 5-6 ms x2
0.2 10-12 ms x4

when the A is blinking is ready to weld in the waiting time you set. When manual setting selected it will weld when you press the button. I plan to install a pedal.

The slightly modded sunkko 788H i'm using does the job but i want a wand and i don't want to pay a grand for it. And yeah, i had to put it on its own 30 amp circuit direct from the breaker box.

This is my pack that I just welded up using this DIY Tab welder...

I modified my design slightly because the wires were overheating... There's now a short length of semi-rigid 16mm² cable from each terminal of the battery going to an electrical connector with to 2.5mm copper electrodes coming from each terminal.

New cable...

I did an in depth test of the spot welder in order to determine the perfect time flux.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voWpcxBbxoA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voWpcxBbxoA)

The multi-stage feature is amazing, it melts the nickel beyond 2x and has 6x available. I am sure it's 0.3 capable or even suitable for other metals. 
Enjoy

The pen is included. Any no nc pedal at ebay works. 3-10 usd will do.[img]https://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/19/70/63/50/20170710.jpg[/img]

It's easy to do. There's 3 wires com,normally open and normally closed. You need to solder com and normally closed to a dupont wire,insulate the third and you are done.
Dunno why the sellers send a tiny wire, I had to add an extension.
[img]https://i11.servimg.com/u/f11/19/70/63/50/20170711.jpg[/img]
also the diagram was incorrect. white,red and black were actually yellow,red and green...and red was not the supposed red. After a few combinations i figured it out.
I did a few welds and is quite comfortable.

Left the pen provided by Aulakiria and right another made by me.
 It is easy to do. Two 50 cm 8awg wires 2 pure copper pins and some shrink pvc.
I did it because I am currently testing copper weld and I am making some serious pressure, i don't want the pins to bend.Aulakiria's is way more comfortable than mine.

Yes works with 4s but it is more dangerous.
You must go easy and set lower flux times if you use 4s. That's why aulakiria recommends 3s. I guess installing heatsinks and fans are also a must if you use 4s.

I did a small video testing copper

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCg4xSKPXoE
this needs more testing, The copper takes a slight damage on the surface because is too thin to work with. The contact must be perfect or the short makes holes.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/3/d3734ad519f4420c79793777c24281e256c82511.jpg" width="458" height="500">

copper is almost 5 times more conductive than pure nickel while disipates better the heat so it's worth testing. 
0.1 almost equals 0.5 nickel strips. I will test some thicker strips next week. let's see....

In case you wanna use copper make sure you understand this:
You need 4s lipo, that makes the boss welder more dangerous.
Copper is difficult to work with, Do not try this if you are a rookie battery builder.
The contact must be perfect or it will make a short and damage the copper strip and probably the cell.
Use manual mode only. Automatic is very dangerous. 
Wearing gloves and glasses is MANDATORY. Lots of sparks and projectiles.

where do you source the .1mm copper strip?  

Very cool!  If the .15mm nickel = about 15A capacity per strip (so we use layers) - how does this compare?

I have 4s in plenty - easier for me to find than old 3s...

Thx for the video - liked the music too!

I did it with aulakiria's. I realized it's not just pressure what it needs but perfect contact.
I still need to do more testing with the copper.
Copper vs blade= perfect
Copper vs 18650= perfect
Copper vs copper= weak...extremely weak. Not viable.
Therefore i asume it's better doing the parallel with nickel (very low conductivity needed) and the series with copper (Very high conductivity needed).
Also i got permission today from aulakiria to test with more voltage (even more danger aaaaaaaah)
Maybe increasing the voltage copper vs copper makes decent welds..... but i do not find it neccesary.
Copper is extremely expensive and the parallel made with copper would be a waste.
I'll test more thickness in a few days. I'll let you guys know the aftermath.

Ok guys. I tested 0.2 copper today and it seems it is not a good idea. Rising the voltage is dangerous. Let's stick with 0.1 and 4s lipo. 0.1 almost equals 
0.5 nickel. That's already a great accomplishment. 
I recommend you to use only 3s lipo and 4s tops if you really have to or you wanna try copper.

As you can see low time flux is useless and high times are very dangerous.  I did quite a hole.
Definitely do not go above 4s guys.

Yes. Sorry i wanted to know if the 6s pack you made in the video. If you are using it to power aulakiria's spot welder? Because i figured it might be dangerous for the spot welder bacause of the high amp drawing mentioned, but if it works that would be awesome lol

The spot welder has two ports. One for the welder xt90 and one for the solder. The solder can take up to 35v. Actually it works better if you use above 19v. The welder works better under 16v. 3s best and 4s tops. It can take 5s and 6s but becomes really dangerous so do not go above 4s.

I tested the 6s battery of the video with the solder. 24v on that port is ok.

Awesome. Thank you that really helps.

Stick heatsinks on the plate and a couple 40mm fans. That will help a lot. I did it and power them with a 12v charger. The welder has a 5v port to install a fan. 5v is enough in cold weather but 12v is mandatory on intense use or warm weather conditions. I posted pics of my mod in the first post.

No. You can't. If you watch my videos you will see the Navigation menu is totally different. You can switch from weld to solder in no time. If you have a good power supply for the solder it heats in no time. With my copper battery I have it ready to solder in under 10 seconds.

I didn't test my 6s copper enough to give you an estimated time of operation off the grid. I am pretty sure it will work more than half an hour. Plenty of time for a field job but I can't be sure about that.

A multi - voltage charger is always useful.
A 3s lipo with an adaptor or a 12v built by yourself with the boss welder... but you better play safe.
ANY external hard disk has a 12v power supply. You want to have those fans working all the time and forget about the heat and how long will the battery last so you better use a 12v power supply.
Just use what you need... in cold weather a 5v fan will do. I need 2 12v.... There's 24v fans available too.

I have been electroplating copper strips lately. I tested today some welds. I succeeded for the first time welding 0.2 copper. Seems the nickel plate helps welding. Double conductivity. 0.2 copper equals 0.9 nickel tabs plus oxidation and galvanic corrosion protected. It's quite an achievement. Still needs more testing but i can tell right now DEFEATED!

Hi aulakiria. Welcome to the forum!  
Yes pals, the boss himself is in tha house!
I used 0.2 pure copper that I plated myself. I explained in one of my videos how to plate the tabs. I used a 709a pen but again.. your pens are way more comfortable. 
I just did a small  pack for an electric skateboard using 0.2 Wide tabs. I taped it and I plan to post the video soon.
I will not recommend using 0.2 copper. I noticed it's a very hard job for the welder and can provoke a failure. 0.1 is much safer to do and the machine does not sweat at all. 
I will post the video as soon as ready.
You rock aulakiria!

Too much is less than insufficient.
It is Korean proverb. ^^;

I do not have a skateboard.
In Korea, many people use spot welders on skateboards.
I was told that the voltage of the skateboard (over 36v) is high, so a 0.15 nickel strip is enough.

I agree. I think nickel is enough for skateboards. I am testing copper for ebikes mostly. The ebikes packs are huge. In that case copper is a good idea.
For skateboards 3s lipo and nickel is the best choice with your machine.

Well i edited my last video. I tried to make it educational. The pack is done with nickel plated copper 0.2 (this is the last time i use that size for security reasons)
Making a 2p pack is NOT a good idea, 3 or 4p generates less heat so the cells will not get damaged. In this case the cells are sony konion 30 amps capable and the build is intended for short range at low speeds so it's not a problem at all. This is not my first 2p pack and i know it works fine.
If you try to do the same use only high C cells. 20+ amps delivery.

Omg another greedy dude like me haha :grin:
0.1 copper needs 5-6 ms x2 on 4s. Make sure you wear glasses and gloves all the time. It is dangerous.  Copper on copper does not weld well. You need to use wide tabs method, pre solder tabs, use neodinium magnets  or use nickel for parallel and copper for series. I didn't have the chance to test 0.15 and 0.2 makes literally burn the pen and damages the machine so you better not do it.
I plated it myself. If you find a plated source let me know. ;)

If you're going to go with Nkon then you should use my handy [filtering tool](http://kevindark.co.uk/PublicServices/NkonFilter) that I made for their range of cells...

You can put in your pack size (n)s(n)p and it'll give you a total cost including multi-buy discount if applicable. You still order on their own website though as clicking on a cell takes you through to their own site.

Check  his youtube videos. Read the comments. People was begging him to sell the welder. He refused for years to do so. A few months ago he opened his hands because sharing his invention makes him happy. He uses top class korean components and spends lots of hours doing them. The very few bucks he makes per unit is not even close to minimal wage in Korea. This is his passion, his hobby.  If that makes no Sense to you just buy another welder or make a custom unit out of a microwave.

For example, Malectrics (the first link) both sells his design as kit or finished product. But he also release all the schematics/PCBs on github :

Some other only sell their desigh (like the JP spot welder on endless sphere). That is absolutely fine.

So please calm down. Your definition of "not selling" and "sharing" is quite a personnal one, that's all.

Can someone explain to me what the actual difference is to the KaeptnBalu spot welder we have all been using?
As far as I can see this spot welder is also "just" another MosFET switch that shorts the batteries for a couple of milliseconds. Without a large capacitor bank I don't understand how the short could happen "beyond the LiPo".
Did anyone actually measure what the lipo experiences?

I was under the impression that the USP of this thing is the ability to use Lipos but if it is "just" a Mosfet switch then this should not be done. Car batteries only!

@guys like @Lambjr088: please wait for the replies befor using this with Lipos. It could be that @rojitor just got lucky and that this spot welder indeed shorts the Lipo leading to increased risk of it failing.

This device has ben widely used in Korea for the last two years. Every lipo user knows that the bricks start bulging when something is wrong. And that didn't happen. His defamatory attitude makes me think he is related to another brand and wants to ruin sales on purpose.

Lipos are not always dangerous. They are dangerous in some situations for example when shorting them. 
Probably this kind of pulsed short does not cause damage to the battery but we need more time to confirm that.

I disagree. Lipo is always lipo. Is the most dangerous chemistry available for batteries. Overcharge, pierce, hits. ...can make it burn.
Must be taken with respect and care. I have been a lipo user for many years and I never ever lost respect and care for it. 
There's Nothing to worry  about if you treat it properly. That's all.

I don't have enough knowledge to give an answer but the question on how the spot welder is working seems legitimate. 
Is the welder shorting the lipo or is there a buffer between the Lipo and the weld (capacitors for example) ? 
Maybe shorting the Lipo directlry is fine but the question is still valid.

In the first post you say that : 
YES! lipo hates being shorted but he managed to make the short beyond the lipo so no damage at all.
Can you elaborate a bit more for us to understand how it works ?

I also already have a lipo from KaptaynBalu but I am curious how this one work.

Sorry pal. I can't give you an accurate answer. Aulakiria said at the youtube comments something about ne555 timer circuit. I don't really know how it works. What I know for sure after so many years using huge lipo packs for my ebikes is how to detect a damaged lipo. I never hesitated to dispose of a bulged brick. None of my packs  (by the way have been many) have been Allowed to have a suspicious brick. 
The lipos I use with this machine are in perfect shape so far.
I guess my opinion is meaningless but this machine has been sold in Korea for years for a reason.
I apologize if I get conspiracy theorist here but all these inflamatory comments do not look legit to me.
Using cheap bms with lipo is dangerous. I never advice to do it. A lot of people here do it though. I do not see that dude caring for them but he is super duper worried for the safety of the boss users all of a sudden.
Microwave transformers M.O.T. Can be lethal, yes I didn't say dangerous I said lethal if treated carelessly.

Let's not play the dumbass game here. Spot welding has some risks.
Batteries have some risks. 
Lipo is dangerous if not treated properly.
No one should buy a device like this if is an irresponsible person, reckless, procrastinator or is just afraid of lipo.

Hello, I am the creator of this device.
I do not speak english well.
so I do not read all the posts of this forum.

Seems some of you are worried about safety. 
I used the lipo as the power source of the welder.
Of course, you can also use deep cycle lead batteries with sufficient capacity.
Lead batteries are also used in Korea.

Lipo fires are well known all over the world. 
Lipo must be treated carefully. 

This device is a timer that controls the flow of electricity.
Electricity should only flow for as short a time as possible.

when the spot welding is completed (nugget is formed), the battery will be in a shorted state.
Continued electricity will damage the battery.
So I limited the time to 16ms (16/1000 sec).

Do not lengthen the time enough for the nickel to discolor.
Your battery is slightly damaged.
Likewise, lead batteries are also damaged. It's just invisible.

Lead batteries are not 100% safe.
Will there be a fire if the lead battery is short-circuited?

This is just my hobby. 
I hope you use it safely.
If you are afraid of Lipo, you can use lead batteries.

If you have difficulty managing the lithium-polimer battery, the 18650 lithium-ion battery management will be more difficult.
The balance of the battery cells of the RC, the electric board and the like should be diligent.
Rather than purchasing a spot welder, please use a regularly sold product.

Thank you. ^^

The machine in video does not seem to have a time controller.
AC controls are harder than DC controls.

Spot welders, such as the Sunkko 709 in China, fail if the AC frequency is different.
Korea is a neighboring country of China.
So Chinese products come in easily.

I also made an AC spot welding controller.
See http://blog.naver.com/aulakiria/221004397424.
Recognize the AC frequency and find the right timing.

Like the DC spot, it has an automatic spot weld function.
It sold more than 200ea in Korea. ^^;

Thank you for the explanation.
The device seems to be very polished.
Please understand that my comments are in no way meant to discredit your product - it seems to be working very well and people are happy with it.
You obviously did a very good job designing and manufacturing it.
My point of concern was only regarding the initial post in this thread that said that this particular spot welder is safer than others when using Lipo batteries.
This is not true.
It is based on the same time controlled mosfet switching principle than the others we know of.
This claim is therefor wrong.

The good thing about this is though, that apparently using Lipos in spot welding seems to be working well with no damage to the batteries so far.
That would allow others to confidently use Lipos with their alternative spot welders as well.

I am in no way affiliated with any spot welder (not commercial nor open source variants) and hope that others do not see me as being defamatory.
I was just trying to understand the technology behind and asked for proof of the claims.

The welder requires a lot of amps. The performance depends on it. It can be powered without lipo in case your battery provides a decent ammount  of amps. "Any" car battery will not work properly. The creator said this at his blog:
"About using car battery :
I have never done spot welding using a car battery.
I was told that a person used the 100A deep cycle.
Batteries vary by manufacturer.
In spot welding, the peak discharge amount is more important than the ordinary discharge amount.
The battery only indicates the normal discharge amount.
You can use two or more batteries in parallel."

How many amps do your battery deliver?
Someone asked time ago If 3 18650 in series would work and the answer was no. 
If your pack has a high C it should work.

You average Lipo outputs less than those A123 cells.
Stating he needs 5P is based on which measurements exactly?
What lipo do you use? The 20C or 30C Turnigy at 5Ah would theoretically output up to 150A (which is exaggerated by the manufacturer) so a 2P would already be in that ballpark.

None of us has ever measured the current an 18650 outputs for such a low duration as well. The rated currents are meant at constant discharge until the battery is empty - this is a totally different scenario.
I would love to see some actual measurements on what current the cells output when shorted - there must be differences but no idea how much.

I honestly wanna know - you can't just use a multimeter to measure such a current - especially at that short duration so you need some other tool.
Finding out what batteries work well for a spot welder application could be really helpful.

You also seem to forget that my initial assumption was right so why should I be a troll?
I am naturally suspicious of any claims that have no proof - that comes with the territory of this forum where a lot of products did not live up to their claims.
Don't take this personal!

I am glad we found out about the spot welder's timing function - personally I walked away smarter than before as I now know that apparently Lipos can handle the abuse.

According to A123's spec sheet of their 26650M1B's, the burst discharge rate is 120A. Continuous is actually closer to 50A. And yes, I'm fully aware they are way more expensive than just going the lipos route, but I just want to know if it's a possibility for me and others if it works as an alternative.

And if I'm reading this right, you said burst discharge current is the one to keep an eye on...so when looking at the lipos @aulakiria recommends on his blog, the burst C on those is 50C...so multiplying the capacity by the burst C, it comes out to a theoretical 250A (hopefully I did this right). So if this is right...the minimum A123 26650M1B battery pack size needed would be 3s2p, but 3s3p would be much better.

Low parallel packs are not a good idea. I guess 3p is the minimum you should use in case the burst they claim they have is true.  I used some lifepo4 packs many years ago,before I started using lipo. The discharge rates continuous were right. The burst were not....
Nevertheless a123 has a huge reputation, it is probably true. 
Maybe some people here has real life xp with Those cells and can give you a good advice. 
I balance my lipos often and care for them properly. I store them inside fireproof bags and I do not fear them at all. With proper use they are not the end of the world.
Use what you think suits you best. Ask for more opinions and I hope you find a good solution.

The more in parallel the better - the burst current when shorted is hard to tell and we don't really know.
A123 are one of the highest discharge cells you can buy though so you should be fine.
You could also look into larger cells if you don't care about the size or weight.
There are 38120 cells out there as well.

Just got the welder. Nice!

Thanks @aulakiria for letting me buy one (and for reverse polarity protection!). Thanks @rojitor for all the testimonials and videos. Thanks @Maxid for keeping everyone honest.

The soldering iron, I don't think anyone noted. I think it's a clone of the Hakko FX-951 system's handpiece. That's a $300 system. When you get past the Hakko 888 level, these temperature controlled tip based systems have amazing thermal recovery and they tend to have nice small handpieces. REALLY nice for $15 add on, and with a nice big fat chisel tip, would be awesome for portable eskate repairs/mods.

Aaaand, I have some new loose A123 cells and a new spot welder. For science? j/k I can't afford to burn 3 cells out of my spare set of 12... So hard to replace!


EDIT A123 are 3.3 nominal 3.6 max, so 4s

Hey guys and @aulakiria , i got a bit of a psa.
The nickel strips shipped with the spot welder are not pure nickel, but nickel plated steel. Don't use them on your packs.
Here's a pic of some 99% nickel vs the aulakiria's nickel plated after being submerged for 1min and 1hs in vinegar+hydrogen peroxyde+salt.

Of course those strips are hilumin. They are also very thin and very few. I guess they are intended to be a courtesy for testing the machine the first day. Then you buy your own. Btw they are not evil.... hilumin is perfect for low power battery packs.  Buy some pure of your choice.
Just an advice: the welds with hilumin create lots of sparks while pure nickel do not. You can know within a minute what you bought and save those tests

My 709a sunkko came with a few of Those too. I guess all spot welders come with some courtesy plated strips.  0.1 is very poor for skateboards even if it was pure. I guess no one used them for sk8 packs. Most people uses 0.15-0.20 it's not that terrible anyway. Most low powered packs use 0.1 hilumin. It is just slower, Nothing wrong with it. 
Were you expecting another kind of strips? If that is the case I will update the first post description but make sure you understand that no one gives 0.2 pure nickel for free. Not even with way more expensive welders.

They served me well to make the review. those are the only plated strips i have. i always buy pure 0.2
Many sellers at ebay, aliexpress etc.... are actually selling hilumin while advertising pure nickel. i can understand your point.

Chinzw is probably upset about the hilumin because many sellers are cheating at aliexpress or ebay with it.
Your courtesy strips are not so good for us because they are 0.1 and very narrow too. Hilumin is not a bad choice though. it's just slower. More resistance and less conductivity. It can be solved by adding more layers. Many builders use it with good results. I prefer pure nickel, less work and better results for a higher price of course.
look at this fellow for example:
[https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/spot-welding-service-i-can-build-your-custom-battery-germany/32412](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/spot-welding-service-i-can-build-your-custom-battery-germany/32412)
he is using hilumin. I'm sure his packs are perfectly good. Hilumin has been widely used on battery packs and yours are just a courtesy samples so i think there's no problem at all about it. Besides....if you ship pure nickel you might have to rise prices and i guess we do not want it . do we?

No. I do not recommend it. I did several batteries using 0.1 copper. They work really well. Nevertheless this welder has been designed to be used with nickel at 3s lipo. Copper requires 4s lipo. It is absolutely copper welding capable. Even 0.2 but the intensive use of 4s could be unpredictable. 
I plan to make more copper batteries but I guess the machine will last longer if you stick with nickel at 12v. Use copper at your own risk.

Oh sorry. Yes I tested aluminium 0.1 and was very disappointing low times had no effect and high times made holes.  It is also difficult to solder. Can be done easily with flux but is quite expensive. I was going to test thicker aluminium and zinc but I lost interest. Copper 0.1 is so damn good that I don't care anymore about other metals.

First, thank you @aulakiria for this amazing device and also big up to @rojitor for all these feedbacks, I read it carefully and it helps a lot !
So you just convinced me and I sent my money in the next second.

Now come the question of the battery. You advice to use 3S lipo for spot welding (with nickel) and 4S (and even more) for soldering. Am I right ?
So do I really need to buy different batteries (don't have 3S or 4S, only 5S, 6S) ?
What is your opinion about that ?

Thank you
```

## \#182 Posted by: rojitor Posted at: 2017-09-07T11:34:16.689Z Reads: 290

```
No. Not exactly. 3s for nickel welding and 19v+ for soldering. They have different  ports. Some charger around for the solder is the best option. Any laptop will do as long as it has a jack connector. You can use lipo with an adaptor for soldering off the grid too but there's no need for it at home. A charger is always better. 
For copper welding the voltage must be rised. 4s is ok for 0.1
The machine can take up to 6s but the more voltage the more dangerous it becomes.  Also aulakiria told me that Rising the voltage can damage the fets  and that's why I recommend stick to 3s and nickel. 0.15 pure nickel is enough for skateboards. I am an ebiker too. Copper is more than welcome for big battery packs and that's why I tested it. If you stick to 3s and use a charger for the hakko solder the machine has potential to be looong-lasting in my opinion.  If you don't have a 19v+ charger any 12v will work too. Just slower... external hard disks usually have 12v power supply.
I hope I explained it right. If not ask again.

Perfect explanation, thank you very much.
I have plenty of power supply at home, so I'll order just a 3S for spot welding. ;)

And how much does consume the soldering iron ?

You mean the packs? That depends on your needs and your esc. From 6s2p to 12s6p everything is possible (for sk8) I guess 6s4p and 10s4p are very common.
If you make low parallel (2p) use only high C cells or the pack will die very soon. 4p+ is the most logical option. The heat is lower and the power transfer is more adequate.

Shopping list:
thermal silicone
heatsink: many small pieces, one 40x60mm or two 40x40mm (must be cut)
female jack 5.5mm
two fans 5v 12v 24v....your choice
a power supply matching the fans
some glue
50mm wide pvc shrink, a piece of 20mm will be enough
4 screws m3x16mm
if you don't have heatgun or hair dryer a lighter can do the job.
all of it can be purchased at ebay,aliexpress,amazon...even at your local electronics store.
The thermal silicone needs some time to cure. It will not reach its full potential until you use the welder for a few times.
The spot welder will not go over 40º using this mod (at least for me)

No, not really. It depends on your weather and the use you make of the machine.
For cell phone repairs i guess the bare plate will dissipate the heat perfectly.
For 0.1 nickel in a cold weather a few heatsinks or a 5v fan installed on that port should be enough.
The more intense use you make of the machine the more the temperature rises.
I installed a 5v on the port the first day....we were in a heat wave and i was welding 0.2 nickel....it was not enough.
Then i installed a bunch of little heatsinks and two 12v fans. The temperature never reached 40º celsius since that day.
Copper welding at 4s lipo rises the temperature considerably. This mod with 24v fans is more than recommendable for that kind of use. For 0.2 nickel i guess it is recommendable depending on your weather. 
I hope it helps.

Hey fellas @rojitor @aulakiria

I powered up for the first time today, since my old gas powered soldering iron is just not up to the job I needed to use the sodlering function first to make a x60 -> x90 connector (for VESC detection). I'll look at spot welding when ready..

I found an old laptop charger and it first up very nicely on 20v (3.25A), it powered right up and it was obvious, turn the knob to increase temp. I increased to 300c and it was too easy to to work the solder and flux/tin the wires, very nice control.

Anyway I hit my first road bump , the soldering tip is very sharp on this lovely Hakko but I was thinking I could use a wider tip? I bought a set of soldering tips from hobbyking some time ago and tried to fit them but their ID is too small by about 0.5 mm. Maybe Hakko should have some kind of tip retainer....I don't know

Anyway can you link a set(10 pack variety) of soldering tips which would work with this Hakko pen on eBay (shipping friendly) whic are known to fit correctly?

Thanks

Ps. I even like the startup tune :slight_smile:

Well I liked my 709A spot welder but for me it was more for the ability to be "off grid". It works very well I thought the spot welder was going to be weak but it is pretty powerful. The soldering iron is beast it heats up fast too. The size was a bonus for me of course you don't have to use lipos you can use a lead acid battery or for the soldering iron a 19v or 24v laptop style charger. I would messasge aulakiria and find out if he has any available. I thought the same but in my case he had some available. I ended up with this. Two boards one used for spot welding the other for soldering both run off of batteries one from lipos and the other from 18650s. Work well and it is the same size as the old spot welder but I can take it and use it anywhere even when the power goes out and where I live during the winter it does a lot. If you have any other questions feel free to ask I will do my best to answer. @jmasta

Sheet is the same. You just have to cut it. 
If you go on with copper remember this:
Copper 0.1 needs lipo 4s 5-6 ms 2x 
Copper on copper makes poor welds. You must pre-solder all the tabs or use the wide tabs method. 
The heat will rise very much, good fans and heatsinks required. 
The pen will get very hot too, you must rest every few welds.
Aulakiria does not support it. You can damage the fets.Do it at your own risk
Glasses and gloves are a must. It is way more dangerous than nickel. 
The contact must be perfect. Gaps will make big holes.
If you agree with all that the conductivity of your battery will be amazing. 
Insane damn good results. I think it is worth it and I will keep doing it but I do not recommend it because of all the issues it involves.

I wrote both on video and description who was the owner of the music and therefore who has the monetization rights of my video. Well.... I got 16 copyright claims.
16!! All of them ilegit of course. Yt deleted my video and they say they are thinking about closing my account. I used in most of my videos copyrighted music. Plugged or from the radio...Either way when you do that you always get a claim and they have all the rights on your video. I have no problem at all with that as I never monetized any of them but in this case they are plain wrong, their attitude is cocky and ilegit.

nice vid.. great to see the welder in action.. As I remember, it is possible to finish all the pack without letting anything cool down right? .. and in terms of energy usage.. the lipos dont get depleted at all (till flat) during spot welding.. ?

You can set a voltage base level, in @rojitor's video I saw 11.7v at a low level, I did the same and a warning beep happens at that point and it will no longer make a weld.

Depends... nickel does not make the machine sweat. I guess you can finish an entire 12s4p pack with 5000 mah with just one charge. If you keep the temperature low there's no need to stop.
Copper is different. The performance is better at full charge so I reloaded my lipos twice. Besides this was a kinda big thing 132 cells. The pen literally burns your fingers so you need to stop every few welds. Maybe it is not noticeable at the video but I used 3 different pens.
I was swapping them every 4 welds to go faster. My machine never reached high temperature with the cooling mod I did. Most of the time was under 40 celsius and barely a few times reached 41 but never above that. As long as you keep the fets under 50 celsius things go smooth. Of course fets are not eternal. Sooner or later they will blow but not sooner than expected if the temperature is under control. 
I will say again that this Wonderful machine was not designed for copper and I do not recommend it. Capable?  Hell yeah. Recommended?  No. Besides 0.15 nickel strips should suffice for most sk8 packs.
This was an ebike pack and copper was the best of the best. It is a totally Insane battery. I even think I overdid it. Is way more powerful than intended.

Thanks for the detailed reply. Yeh i didnt see how you switch pens.. though I did think whenever it would feel nice to hold the pen such close to the tip.. as others I think use long prongs (at least for a lot of sunkko welders, for example)

The pen is really comfortable. Welding nickel the heat is not so noticeable. 
Aulakiria has a video making tons of welds without gloves, no problem at all.

From 1:00 to 2:05 he is non stop welding. The heat is Nothing to worry about with 3s lipo and nickel.

watch it again. as chinzw said the machine is automatic by default A icon. To use the button or pedal you need to change it to manual mode. lightning icon. 2:05 in the video. when the lightning is blinking and both electrodes touch the metal it will work as soon as you press the momentary button. 
Make sure the lightning is blinking and both electrodes touch the metal. It can be tricky sometimes.

Hey guys. I need some help with making a battery pack with the 18650 batteries.
I have the batteries and have the nickel tabs to solder to them but am lacking a soldering device and a battery management PCB. It needs to be the unchanged 3.7 voltage and I need to run a Mini male USB wire from it, and be able to charge the pack with it.

If anyone lives in Toronto or GTA and is willing to help out with it I'll pay you.... If you have some sort of knowledge on battery power management PCBs and which ones are good it would be best.

Contact me at igorpal@hotmail.com 

I am obviously willing to come to your place to get this stuff done....

I tested nickel 0.5 today. It was horrible lol. The mechanical properties are very tough. It is really difficult to cut and the strips are so bent that is even more difficult to flatten. Since I left some Gaps the holes I did are huge.
I managed to do some nice welds in a tiny strip but the obvious verdict is NOT WORTH IT.
It is even more difficult than 0.1 copper with 0 benefits. 
Mission failed.

these welds are actually quite good but i don't feel like hammering every square mm of it to flatten it properly. 0.5 discarded for good.

I made a test today. Tungsten electrodes
[img]http://i67.tinypic.com/25g8300.jpg[/img]

[img]http://i63.tinypic.com/im2umx.jpg[/img]
it was kind of more powerful than copper electrodes.I did big holes with the same flux times on 4s so i tested 3s. It welds 0.1 copper on 3s.

[img]http://i68.tinypic.com/2946pvm.jpg[/img]
[img]http://i67.tinypic.com/vrzmuu.jpg[/img]
i did a thorough test on 3s

close look

reverse
[img]http://i64.tinypic.com/2jcimc4.jpg[/img]
the whole thing 
[img]http://i66.tinypic.com/64dngy.jpg[/img]

As seen at the pics it welds 0.1 copper on 3s but it gets stuck, so when i remove the electrodes due to the mechanical properties of the copper it breaks apart.
did 0.2 on 4s and pretty much the same results. actually i do not want to push the machine on 0.2 because it would blow the fets. So no further testing on that.
Even if it is more powerful i couldn't get a single decent weld without breaking the strip. Maybe if i sharpen more the electrodes i can get a better result. 
verdict: Tungsten electrodes proved to be more powerful yet more difficult to deal with (yes even more)
So far not worth it. Mission failed.

That reply is rude. Maybe you did not understand my Point. 
The video you posted is very nice but is not nickel plated steel tabs.
My Point is: 
You get the aliexpress or whatever box. You go to your work place. You open with a cutter the box. You break a little piece of the blade of the very same cutter. You turn on the spot welder and start welding your new strip on the blade. As soon as you see a spark you know it is plated. Period.
Of course the corrosion tests are accurate but I am showing the quickest possible test. 
It is ok if you hate me and you think I am a dick. But at least you should have a well deserved reason to call me that.
This method is not "my method" it has been widely discussed at the sphere and many battery builders are no longer using corrosion tests because this way is faster.

Ok. No steel. The reason for the blade is the steel. It is similar to the steel of the 18650 batteries. If you repeat the test ON STEEL....a blade, a battery etc..
You should see small sparks. Sparks on pure nickel are very rare. Mostly because of gaps, dirty tabs (or at least not clean) or shorts.
If you repeat the test on steel you will see the sparks. 
Also as I recently explained this is the fastest method but not the most accurate. If you have doubts use corrosion methods.

Originally I was thinking about welding with a single piece of 0.1mm copper that would act as the bus and cell fuse for each end of a 3P group. 

But to handle 60A continuous, I would need a wide bus strip and really narrow fuse that will probably just mechanically break. So now I'll probably use a thicker .4mm thick copper bus and spot weld individual nickel strips to the bus and battery ends.

actually is not easy to do. You need 4s to weld nickel on copper and the welds are acceptable but not as strong as copper on steel. Copper on copper is even worse therefore the best way with copper is the wide tabs method.

i just tested it for you.
to do 0.1 nickel on copper you need 3.5-4ms on 4s
to do 0.15 nickel on copper you need 6-7ms on 4s
i am low on pure so i used plated and didn't test 0.2. I guess 0.2 can be done with 7-8ms. 
As seen on video plated is not a good idea. Use only pure for that

Thanks rojitor! I couldn't make out the details, but those look like your 4s batteries. 

I"ll get some 4s to test when my welder gets here too. But now I'm planning to only spot weld the nickel on the battery. For the other end, I can just solder the nickel to the copper bus.

The power comsumption is low but copper is some serious business...
The welds quality drop along with the voltage so I try to keep the battery fully charged as much as possible. I refilled twice but the cells were at 3.9-4v
I do not let them go below that when welding copper. Besides I give some rest to the machine while charging.
Nickel works better with low voltage. The same pack could probably be done with just one charge if I used nickel.

So I have just started trying to use this spot welder and am having problems with it.

1) In manual mode trying to weld the sample nickel plated strip that came with it to a box cutter blade I need to use 16 ms x 4 pulses to get a solid weld.  

2) In automatic mode set for only 4 ms x 1 pulse, 4 out of 5 attempts it appears to just reboot.  For battery power I am using two 3s 2.2 Ah 25C lipos in parallel - both are almost fully charged at 12.2 volts.

https://youtu.be/oP9apVUQ_Vw

Is it just that my battery source is not good enough or did I get a dud?

Really weird. The voltage looks fine. 12v. 
Try only one lipo. If you can borrow another lipo try it.
Check all wires

The reset, because the battery discharge rate is insufficient.

2x 3s 2.2 Ah 25C is similar to 3s 5A 25C.
But, current loss occurs at XT60 connector and 12 AWG wire(XT60-XT90).

1. Direct connect the connectors(XT90-XT60). without 12AWG wires
2. Switch to a more powerful battery.

Hi @aulakiria,
I'm having an issue while usine your spot welder as a soldering iron.
Now, when I start it, the temperature set point is reset to 0. It's kind of annoying to spin again and again to reach the desired set point.
I didn't change anything between 2 startups.

Preset 0 is saved as 0 even if temperature is changed.

Preset 1 ~ 5 can be selected by pressing encoder.
Try changing the temperature of preset 1.
After the iron is turned off and then back on, the preset temperature of preset 1 is memorized.

its a long thread and I'll be reading the designer's guides but if any of you have tried these specifically please tell me how it went

 https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=68005&hilit=spot+welding+18650 people here seem to be using much less material than recommended in this link.  I'm hoping to get away with .15mm copper that's maybe 18mm wide or maybe I'll have to settle for .1mm thick, which is still very low conductance according to the link.  or can simply fold over a 30mm thick tab.  How many welds per cell is best?  the weld is such little contact it seems the more the better

I did intensive testing with other metals. [My es thread](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=89076)

I did many battery packs with 0.1 copper. It seems to be the best.
I managed to weld 0.2 copper as well but it damages the fets. I didn't test 0.15 because it was not in stock. 
My tests with aluminium were disappointing. Low flux times have no effect and high times make holes. Besides it is extremely difficult to solder.  I'd say impossible without aluflux. Aluminium is very cheap yet I couldn't find sheets at a reasonable price so I lost interest. Copper is the best.
I shared pics and videos in this very thread and the sphere's. 
Take a look if you have some time. 
Be careful with the copper. Proper cooling ,glasses and gloves are a must.
Share with us your experience please.

tell me if i'm wrong but even if it will only do .1mm copper that should be good and I can just use a much wider folded-over tab and get really good conductance.
 Looking at chart from the es link I posted above and extrapolating for the use of copper being 4x as conductive, a 28mm folded tab should put me in the green for 48 amps, no?

Yes. With 0.1 copper you can get around that cypher. 

![Ampacity (Powestream extrapolation)|400x268](upload://bnasEDudYBcUKo3VGiO04llE1Lj.jpg)

0.1 is relatively safe for this welder. You will need 4s lipo and 5-6 ms X2 flux time.
Copper on copper makes poor welds so the best option is using wide tabs or solder+weld tabs. I always used wide tabs. The results are outstanding. 
All my copper packs are over powerful. Keep in mind:
As I said many times lee designed this machine to be used on 3s with nickel. It is copper capable but you will shorten the lifespan of the fets.
I agree with that. It is totally worth it imho but lee does not support it.
If you engage copper you must asume the risk.

Got my spot welder, took less than 5 days from time of order to delivery via EMS.

Very high quality feeling bit of kit.  I ordered a couple 40c 3s batteries to run in parallel, since the only other one I had  was an old 20c that's been kicking around a drawer for the last 2.5 years and I can't seem to get it to do anything.

Now just gotta read up on the settings and get everything dialed in, ordered my batteries, and build myself a pack.

We could set up an account with the value of it in there so you know I won't not return it.  PM me if you would be open to this.  Figured I'd give this a try at least :)

That depends.  Is that a series or a parallel adapter. 
It looks like a parallel so 6s

USUALLY parallel adapters have the dual connectors oriented the same and series have one turned upsidedown

I couldn't help going way overboard.  16 x4 *2  with 4s charged and then dialed it way back down after I had a green flame coming out of the back of cell.  blew a solid 1mm hole in the can.  but that was all practice with duds.
lately been having good results with 2mil copper (.127mm) at 8 x3  but still its really inconsistent and wondering if anyone has advice.  so far it seems better now that I moved the two electrodes closer to each other.  Also helps sitting the electrodes on an edge as apposed to the flat.  And having the timer wait 3 sec so have time to get a really nice pressure with BOTH electrodes.  Maybe 6lbs of pressure.  and keep the copper flat.  But that's just my very early experiences and really looking for someone else to tell me what they recommend.

the timer sometimes doesn't work and nothing happens at 3sec, and then bang it goes as soon as I touch.
what about adjusting the "multi-stage MS"?  
and the voltage adjustable limit...does it keep beeping because i'm going below it or what?

If the timer fails turn it off and start again. You risk a hole otherwise.
Copper requires certain practice. Is way more difficult than nickel.
Press with your finger the points. They must be close and very clean. I have sandpaper on the table and rub the points every 3 welds. Use the edges only. Just the tips will not make good welds.
For multistage you need x2 if you set x3 set a high value of interval to protect the fets.
Be extra careful welding the positive button. If one of the points touches thin air you got a guaranteed xl hole. I usually press the copper against the button to see clearly the circle límits. 
For copper keep the battery always fully charged. The welds quality drop along with the voltage. Refuel 4 times per pack if you have to.
Test first with blades and duds. As soon as you máster it go for the pack

Spot welders are not electrically charged because they use low voltage (30v or less). You can work with your bare hands.

looking at the what someone said on endless-sphere long ago about what current is acceptable for what thickness and resistance, what do you think about this chart
:![dslkfjdlkfjdslkjf|549x500](upload://cRGK0sXSwL3oYeSC5cueaVCdV2G.png)

how much strip of nickel or even copper are people doing? I was thinking Id fold some 30m wide .12mm  copper to get within 50amps and in the "optimal" setting on the chart...but rather not.  rather do one strip of .12mm copper at 15mm wide and thinking most people aren't getting as much on as the chart shows...but maybe it's worth it.

but how can you practice on this thing, is a box cutter good?  similar resistance steel? and then my box cutter is already covered in pock marks already and a file doesn't allow me to get it as smooth as a cell.  

what size nickel are you doing?![ccmcmcmcm|690x461](upload://fIi84E0KBvTFN8VUHd1anWVsAqD.jpg)

Yes you can use your bare finger on it since it is pvc shrinked. Nevertheless you WILL NOT bear the heat at 16v. The pen gets really hot welding copper. Glasses and gloves are mandatory. I recommend you to stick a thin piece of wood, plasticard etc.... on that spot in order to resist the heat. Also do not do it all in a row. Let the pen cool down every now and then. Refuel the lipo several times and let both machine and pen cool down. Have you modded the boss? At 16v it will reach 50° celsius in the blink of an eye. Cooling is mandatory for copper and recommended for nickel.

The packs I did with 0.1 copper are brutal. I wouldn't bother making them any thicker. For sk8 0.15 nickel is enough if you do front bend. For side bend (only one strip for series and parallel) i'd use several strips.
I use 0.2 pure as standard.  The price difference is meaningless while the performance improves a lot.

Yes, we exchange together by email :sweat_smile:


I will document the repair on this forum, maybe it will be useful to others.
By count I remain skeptical about what caused this problem because I was very cautious in the use of the spot welder. Repair is not going to treat the root cause of the problem (hoping there was no damaged component).:face_with_monocle:
Even if there is a problem, I want to emphasize that Lee is very available and serious in his communication. I hope to be able to find a solution by myself or we will carry out an exchange at my expense.

I still ask the question of adding a conventional fuse, not to have desoldering everything as soon as there is a problem (I am waiting for a return from Lee on this point).

Probably. I think you are pushing it.But that depends on your battery. With my battery setup 8 is too high. With yours maybe you need more than 10. 
Also I was welding 0.1 and you are welding 0.13 you need more than me
Make sure:
You have your lipo fully charged
Points polished
Good contact
Good cooling on the fets
Good pressure
I'd try a thinner tab and another lipo. I guess you can borrow it. In case your lipo is new and top quality forget about the lipo advice.

[quote="Hummie, post:372, topic:25980"]
how much strip of nickel or even copper are people doing?
[/quote]

The way I've been thinking about this... Normally parallel connections carry very little current, so just about anything works.

Series connections carry full current. If using 30q and you want full power, each cell's series connection should be able to handle 20a for at least a few seconds at a time. It seems 10mm x .2mm is almost okay for one cell's power.

So, if 4p, I'm thinking each cell gets a series connection to the next group, 4 strips. This is good for the foldable part of the pack, but if connections are going across the tops (or bottoms) of the cells, need to add some serious copper.

I'm thinking you want more copper than the 4 x 20a would mandate, because since you make the connection at the first or last cell, you have some non-zero resistance as you go across the parallel group, leading to uneven load sharing in the group. So minimizing this resistance will help with load sharing.

Someone please tell me I'm overthinking this!
```

i'm making a single layer pack and all the connection are part of the same chain and the parallel connections are using the same strip as the series, and there's uneven load sharing.   A giant serpentine path.   its not an ideal way to do it electrically but if you have a diagram of a single layer pack with better I'd like to see it before tonight when I'm going for it.  

come to find what I think the danger is with copper and gloves aren't gunna solve it.   You can more easily blow a hole in a cell with the high power and possibly not know it and have a hole in your pack.    I was practicing on a cell I know had a hole and it went what I guess would be "runaway".  Not a fire but too hot to hold.

i'll put more lipos in parallel to see if I can then put in a lower "ms"

So I removed the upper PCB by desoldering the 6 pins of connection with the middle PCB . I used desoldering braid.
As you can see in the photo there is a PCB track that burned and it's broken. This track is used for powering the arduino, and as I was told, the track serves as a fuse to protect the arduino.
As I'm not sure what caused the problem, I decided to put a conventional fuse (1A) to protect the arduino and be able to replace it easily without having to restart everything.
The arduino restarts :sweat_smile::yum:, but I have not tested the spot welding part with this assembly.
Wait & see.

I must be cursed with this spot welder. Following my previous repair, I started assembling my pack. Visibly there must have been a short circuit at the time of the welding, I had briefly a "FET error" then the fuse that I had installed jumped. I think this time I will have a hard time finding a solution.
The god of the esk8 is definitely not with me right now .... :disappointed_relieved:

The positive button must be taken carefully. If you have one of the points on thin air you got a guaranteed hole. You must aim at the centre of the circle.
Everything around that circle is negative so shorts are very easy to do. Just by looking at the pic seems you aimed to the edge.
Repair those electrodes. Make sure they are insulated from each other.
Seems the shrink has been damaged.  And the copper darkened. Rub the points gently on a sand paper and use some shrink tube if needed. The short must take place on the nickel not on the points.

Yup. Those things are designed to be put and weld on them.
I used 10mm on those. No problem at all

First you put the separators and then you weld on it. No problem.

Funny.  I had already watched that one, and other videos.  But I never noticed the strip goes above the plastic and nor I  between.  Just always assumed it fitted between the plastic pads

@rojitor Thank you for this! I just bought individual black spacers today (for my 10s4p evolve upgrade project) at [aliexpress](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/18650-battery-holder-bracket-Cylindrical-battery-holder-18650-li-ion-cell-holder-Flameresistant-material-Safety-anti/1982118662.html) and was wondering what I was going to do about the spot welder until I stumbled upon this thread and read the whole thing. My roommate insisted on the microwave method, which to me is another DiY project I do not want to commit to. The Sunkko is huge and expensive. This Boss Welder is perfect, especially cause of it's size. I have emailed the creator for one :) 

After some [battery insulators ](https://us.banggood.com/Wholesale-Warehouse-200Pcs-Cardboard-18650-Battery-Insulators-Electrical-Insulating-Adhesive-Paper-wp-Usa-1111608.html) arrive I'll get to work on spot welding some 0.15mm Pure Ni strips to 18650's with the above spacers attached, bypassing the need for a jig. However, in your [latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYOh_15mri8&feature=youtu.be), I noticed that you did not use any insulators while using the spacers on the 18650's - are the insulators unnecessary?

I always use gaskets on the cells. Between them fish paper is not a must if you use spacers. They breath and do not touch each other so no problem.
Use always gaskets on the contacts. That part is very easy to short. Between cells is recommended or a must depending on your battery shape, heat, performance. ..

That's not mandatory. I asked you guys to consider that option because lee is double charged. Paypal charges their fee plus conversion to korean currency.  Since he is making a really low profit (if any at all) out of this it's convenient if we do so. I did. It's up to you take that consideration. Again..Not mandatory.

@rojitor  One is for a friend.. 

But I wish I had bought extra welding cables. I'm running it on 4s. And I temporarily mounted the welder to a aluminum plate that I'm gonna cut down to fit in this case..so I can basically weld continuously under 40c.

But I need to either wait for the welding wires to cool or swap them out every 75 welds or so.

So i did repair the fet problem. The welder fires up. The only problem is that now it can't detect my lipo's voltage and keeps beeping. need to investigate that with Lee @aulakiria

@aulakiria  yes XT90, everything seems OK when taking voltage between pin 1 and 2.

do you have other point on this PCB where i can check the voltage to find the problem ?

(Is it possible to use the welder even there is this problem? i can monitor lipo's voltage other way )

The wiring on the PCB seems to have fallen.

If it falls below the set voltage, spot welding will not be possible.

So with single layer cells any thoughts on welding the nickel strips sideways to a copper bus bar and just folding it over on top of the P cells.  Assuming welding nickel to Cooper goes well.  That way each nickel strip can handle the individual battery and the copper bar can handle the P group.

Nickel on copper is possible...yet difficult to do and not good quality. I suggest to solder instead. If that is not an option make many welds to leave it as firm as possible. The neodinium trick is always a safe bet too.

just joined to boss spot welder's club, finally put things together yesterday and was doing test welds today.

i scavenged some cells from an old build and put together a 3s12p pack made with 25r cells.  on paper, this pack can output 240a comfortably, almost 400a burst.

i'm finding, however, that the recommended timing isn't working at all.  that is, 4ms for .15 nickel to steel weld isn't doing anything.  i'm about doubling (8ms by 2x) the time to get a solid .15mm nickel to steel weld.

for a .15 nickel to nickel weld, i'm having to up the weld time to 16ms by 4x.

is this the result of my pack not being able to deliver enough amperage?  i was sure a 12p pack would suffice.

@thisguyhere those settings seem high. Probably the batteries. I'm using 8000mah lipo and I downed it to 1.3 because it was doing holes at 1.4. I wonder if the nickel strips aren't letting enough instant amps through.

Also that's a monster heat sink

The new version is more resilient to 4s lipo. I'm not sure but maybe the side effect is that requires a better 3s lipo. I used a top lipo since day one and the flux times always were as posted at 1st post.
I can't edit it anymore but seems I have to recommend the best possible lipo now on.

## \#533 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-03-05T16:52:42.640Z Reads: 166

So from what I've noticed

-frozen weld cables or cold weld cables need less MS and less multiplier as the resistance is lower. 
-as the weld cables get hotter the resistance increases, making the MS and multiplier higher.
-having a big pack helps(I use a 32Ah 4s 10C - which can easily do 320A continuous)
-less batteries being welded requires less timing. Ie when I weld a 5p pack vs a 2p pack. I lay the nickel on and then hold it down across. Resistance changes the welds. Ie for 5p, on a 4s power supply, 4.5ms x2 works well, but if I used this setting on a 2p pack I would burn a hole. The 2p on 4s power supply needed 2.5ms x1. 

Basically you need to account for temperature (air) as well as relative humidity, temperature of the welding wires, the resistance of the material (nickel), and the resistance of the pack surfaces (how many cells are attached to the strip).

About the humidity, below 45%RH, is considered dry, and air is likely to hold static charged ions making burning holes with to much power even more likely. Weld in 55-65%RH and it will suppress the extra sparking from charged ions in the air.

Regarding heat of the fets...I easily got the fets upto 48c cutoff after 30-40 welds in a row.... I added my plates and highest I've seen is 31c after 290 welds in about 20 minutes. Basically I put this thing through the paces hard lol.

good to know, to start i'm putting a 2p pack together and welding 40 x 10 x .15mm nickel so don't think material resistance is the culprit.  and environmental conditions are ideal.

aside from the battery, only other bottleneck may be the 10awg wires coming off the battery, it's about 18" in length, maybe that's adding too much resistance?  i could probably double that up and see if it makes a difference.

Maybe I'm not sure my wires from lipo tab to welder are about 11".

A test you could try, if you have some dead VESC laying around... Add a cap rail right by the input of the welder... Then you can rule out whether it's length of wire or C capability... As the caps should fix anything if it's from resistance during the burst current.

I am rebuilding my battery so I can fit it in a new enclosure and so I could weld on higher quality nickel (apparently the stuff I had on was just nickel plated).  I ripped off all the old nickel and cleaned off the positive and negative with flush cuts so I could get a smooth surface to weld on.  There are two leads that the nickel will just not weld to.  I have tried cleaning it off again and raising the ms.  I also recharged my battery to make sure I was getting the most power out of it.  But it just wouldn't stick.  I attached a picture of the battery surface and a piece of nickel that I had tried to spot weld.  Honestly it doesn't look the weld went through the strip.  But I wasn't comfortable turning the ms past 7.  Any advice for what I could do?

did you put insulator rings on the anode end of the cell? if so, not necessary. 

I've done almost the same thing with my salvaged cells, ground off the welds. 

only tried to weld two cells so far but haven't encountered what your experiencing, maybe I'll see the same thing once I get into this next build. 

you may just have to resort to soldering if the welding doesn't work on those specific cells.

So, I tried spot welding nickel to nickel and I went all the way up the 11 ms and it still wouldn't stick together.  It seems like it's just not putting out as much power as it was before.  Could it just be that I have a crappy battery?  It is a 40C but it was on the cheaper side.

So here's this.

Nickel to Nickel
4.0ms, 3x, 2ms pulse delay

First strip of nickel 0.15 to 18650
3.5ms, 2x, 2ms

Second strip of nickel to 18650 ie nickel to nickel
6ms, 1x

I would guess your lipo cannot handle the current then. 

When I tested with meter it pulls any here from 60-120amps for a couple millisecond on 4s..

Which is probably why 40C+ lipos are recommended

It really looks like you don't have the proper amount of amps.  I was running into a similar issue even while running 2 x 3AH 3S 40C Lipos in parallel.  I was using a longer wired parallel adapter that was dropping the amps.  A single 3S lipo of that size/rating just wouldn't cut it.  I suggest either going with a dual setup with a good adapter in parallel or a higher AH lipo.

3ah* 40c =120a
10ah* 10c = 100a

I tried to look in a few places but they seem to be only nickel plated steel. Would be cool to find some with shipping to europe, can be from china, i dont mind, as long as price is good.

---
On a side note - im planning to get the welder too - so does it mean that it is better to get 4s battery? @Deckoz

At first I was looking into 3s, as @aulakiria claimed it is seemingly safer, right?

Though from what @Deckoz said, it almost looks like 4s will perform better and will need less amps / capacity for same amount of performance more or less, if not even better one

the feeling I have is that welding copper with this unit is not really worth the trouble. And 4s putssmore strain on all hhe electronics but doesn't help when welding nickel. After all it's currrent that makes the heat. Voltage should not make much difference (maybe balance againt the resistance of the system as a whole), and more volts may mean less amps and less heat in the weld?
```

Depends

I know this isn't current controlled... Just pulse control..

But let's say underneath the covers it's programmed for 20amps on the fets

12.6v * 20a = 252w
16.8v *20a = 336w

Obviously it's not current controlled. It's timing controlled. So if volts = speed. During the same time delay, more energy would pass through with higher volts. 




Don't confused higher voltage for lower amps for the same work, as that is different
12.6v * 20 = 252w
252w/16.8 = 15a

Yeah but I^2*R that makes the welding heat, right? V is not a part of that equation.

(EDIT this part is wrong wrong wrong, it's directly proportional -- current goes up with voltage. the I^2* part is correct and the MOT thing is valid but not for the I=V/R reason)
And with just timing for control, I=V/R takes over. R is constant and current is inversely proportional to V.

Am I seeing this wrong?

This. is why people on youtube wire microwave oven transformer for 2volts to have fun melting stuff?

As I understood welder works up to 6s and with 4s temperature should be monitored more and heat sinks (and/or fan) are even more recommended.

I will probably go with what @rojitor recommends. Will ask him personally in PM, what is his opinion about this.

Even when the switch on the device was OFF the soldering tip was still heating up and getting red hot.  I made sure all my connections were good.  I did notice one of the leads on the power supply side was not soldered.  Is it supposed to look like that?  I moved it around and made sure it was touching the lead on the board and nothing changed. It didn't effect it before, it was working perfectly before today.  @aulakiria

I have some sand paper on the table. I just rub them gently every few welds. No need to grind them to x shape. Just keep them polished. 
With pure nickel strips you should get very few to no sparks at all. If you use plated they are unavoidable.

Holes should never happen. That's dangerous. It is easy to fail when welding the positive button. If one of the points is on thin air you got a guaranteed hole. They must be well centered within the circle. Also bad pressure can lead to a hole. The strips must be perfect flat. If they are bent, part of the metal can have a gap and hence the hole. 
The tips tend to lose the round shape no matter what. It is ok if they are slightly sharp.

When you superimpose the strips of nikkel (see the image below), the problem is that we can have bands not perfectly in contact because the one below is already welded to the battery. ... but hey I feel that it's more related to the shape of my pins because I had the problem at the end of my pack and not at all at the beginning ... I will put pictures tonight.

I keep some steel wool around to polish my tips...(make sure to turn off the welder if your using steel wool) lol.

But really I've done hundreds of welds in a row without polishing the tips... They last longer when you weld from the side vs straight down.

i was getting inconsistent weld spots between the two probes too, was blaming the uneven wear on the tips, but turns out i wasn't giving it enough amps.

got a 7Ah 60c gens ace lipo pack and thought it'd be enough.  but wasn't happy with the inconsistent welds.  so for science last night paralleled a 3s12p liion pack and now it's welding perfectly sized spots across the two probes.

i should have taken you all serious when you said max amperage in the beginning.

but it's paralleled with a 7Ah 60c lipo.

i built the 3s12p liion pack (25r cells) initially to use on the spot welder but [it sucked](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/boss-level-custom-spot-welder/25980/521).

so replaced it with a high discharge lipo pack, but i felt it still wasn't delivering enough.

so added the 3s12p liion pack in parallel to provide even more amperage.

now i'm really happy with the performance with the two packs connected in parallel.

Please help me understand what went wrong here:

So today I finally started building my battery. I have the Malectrics spot welder on a 420A car battery. Everything was going smooth as butter. After some tests I decided to go with 30ms pulse time which made the 0.2mm Nickel strip stick to the batteries really well.

![IMG_20180324_184315|666x500](upload://o16tWrOmLg6mU1LbVzHTet4eave.jpg)

When I started welding Nickel on Nickel (the series connections, strip pieces for BMS attachment) it just wouldnt stick as nicely as it did to the battery itself. These didnt tear when I tried to pull them apart but instead the strips seperated pretty neatly. Any ideas for improvements?

![IMG_20180324_205200|375x500](upload://d7SDHZNMHcZttSRmBFdcPEOp6IS.jpg)

Between normal welds, I suddenly had two random welds inbetween that went absolutely bonkers.
Loud and bright spark and the one actually BLEW A FREAKIN HOLE THROUGH 2 LAYERS OF NICKEL AND INTO MY CELL!!!!!!! - explosing some blue plastic.

![IMG_20180325_005850|488x499](upload://oUon6WeZoBX6Al2Eoa87Bcc1nhi.jpg)

Almost lost my cool there for a second, having to tear apart an almost finished pack again in order to replace the cell :grimacing:


Luckily I bought 2 extra cells for blunders like this.

Can you guys please tell me what went wrong and how I can avoid it in future?

My 3s 6000mah 65c graphene just arrived. muy bueno, big thumbs up. Fully charged, getting perfect welds on .20mm -> utility knife blade at 4ms. 7ms too beaucoup, blows holes through.

The 5000mah is much cheaper ($40 vs $60). Was OOS when I ordered, back in stock before my 6ah one got delivered. Grr hobbyking!

[quote="petter, post:609, topic:25980"]
Has anyone here tried out the kweld?
[/quote]

kweld was the first one I had my eyes on. I bought the BOSS, but broke down and bought a kweld too. Really robust and powerful. 4 times bigger. Costs more. Gonna be hard to kill, and I like that it measures energy, and is not just a simple timer. The BOSS maxes out at 16ms. kweld at 150 joules stayed on for 80ms. Everything gets hot but the welder. Electrodes, battery wires and connectors all get hot. Fets stay nice and cool.

I have some interesting numbers to share. Both units operate by short circuiting the battery to the weld spots with fets, time controlled. The graphene 3s delivers about 1070a through the kweld. This is dependent on the resistance of the system. If BOSS system has similar resistance, it's also shooting ~1000A with this battery.

kweld specifies 1500A max.

I got about 1000A with a Tattu 4s 22000mah (22ah!) 25c lipo. The graphene is amazing. kweld maker says the Turnigy Nanotech 3s 65c 5000mah ($50 right now) gives same performance as this Graphene pack. The normal Turnigy 3s 50c packs puffed, but the Nanotech and Graphene took the abuse.

For the graphene 3s, 0.20mm nickel to utility knife blade, kweld at 7 joules was 4ms. 11 joules gave 7ms. This is all around at around 1070A.

I'm getting very strong bonds for 2 layers of .20mm nickel to utility blade at 35 joules, 27ms.

I know this is the BOSS thread, and the BOSS is really good stuff, love it. So tiny and has the high end soldering thing built in. I like the electrode handle.

But I'm sure this info will interest a bunch of people on this thread.

Put your finger on the blue pvc and give the points more inclination. Make a little pressure to make sure the contact is perfect.
Make sure the strips are perfectly clean. If you still have so many sparks that's not pure or has a very low purity even if not plated.
Did you dremel the strips before the corrosion test? it fails if you do not grind it to the soul. The acid must penetrate deeply to provide results.

Of course. The metal (steel) and thickness is similar to the 18650 and you can look to the reverse. That's a great advantage. Black marks and burnings on the other side are a direct information that you are going too deep. 
Cutter blades are so far the best test for spot welding i have seen.

I=V/R takes over. R is constant and current is inversely proportional to V.

Am I seeing this wrong?

WTF is wrong with me and why didn't anyone call me out lol. I=V/R that's directly proportional, not inverse. With constant resistance current goes up as you increase voltage. Sorry guys!

@Deckoz

EDIT As for the danger of going 4s, learned from kweld research, there's a large inductive kickback when you unleash the angry pixies. Voltage spike. So going over maker's specs may exceed the protections he's put in. For kweld, in earlier versions he didn't have enough protection on the voltage converter powering the MCU.

hi there!

Thanks for your answer.. I did test the nickel strips but only scraping with a knife before putting them into a salty bath.
This is what it looked like after 24h. You can see the rust but its more visible on the picture than in RL.

![DSC03676|507x500](upload://mAUMA5E6p4ApeOAMf60kM21q8lq.JPG)

So I took your advice and used a dremel to grind off the potential layers of nickel from the plate and guess what... This is the result after 24h of a salt bath. Only one pure nickel band which I received 2 days ago and didn't used it for the welds in the video I posted above. I think the sparks come from the steel. Will test it again with pure nickel

On a side note - what do u use for cutting nickel strips? Do u use regular scissors or something more fancy?

Also - **for those who use 4s lipo - what pulse time do u go best with?**

I set it at 7ms in manual mode, 4s 60c 5ah heavy duty lipo.. with shorter time welds dont come as consistent or somehow are blowing holes..

Though I somewhat think now I should have went with 3s lipo for 0.2mm strip

I do get burn marks, so it points in direction I shouls decrease the timing

If you go for 0.2 copper make sure you understand that you will put your machine to the max. You can kill the fets so i do not recommend you it. 0.1 is way easier to do and not so dangerous for you and the machine.

One time?  No of course not. You will need to set very high time flux and multiplier to weld 0.2
That will put your welder to the limit. Eventually it will kill your fets. 0.1 is way safer. That's my advice.

Edit: just saw a dude in this thread was having trouble with is 7ah 60c, doubtful me paralleling my lipos will work :[ worth the try i guess

Yes you can use the bms as long as it is compatible and in good shape. 
And no, I don't think just 2 of Those in parallel can provide amps enough for spot welding.
 Low C and low mah=low amps. Maybe you can sell them and buy a used lipo capable for this matter.

I'm going to challenge this. Someone one the kweld thread at ES had good success with HK Graphene 3s 2200mah 65c. I think it's more about the internal resistance. Or perhaps that other large number everyone ignores (130c for these guys) is actually the more pertinent one.

For sure, your results may vary, mayb it's the lipo pack I got off amazon bc hobbyking fuct up my order, but the 7ah 65c lipo pack I got wasn't cutting it at all. 

only when the lipo was paired with the giant 3s12p liion pack it started to weld properly. 

moral of the story, get the best possible lipo with the highest possible C rating.

The number we must look is the burst. The continuous discharge rate is irrelevant. Therefore 65-130 C--- 130 is what matters multiplied by the mah=the amps we are gonna get (in case the rating is legit)
I dunno the minimum amps required for a decent weld but for sure it is over 300 amps. I think lee said the machine is rated for 800 amps. The latest version has been beefed up so a little more maybe.

@aulakiria was awesome in shipping the welder the same day I ordered it, getting it to me in the U.S. in a week.  Can someone please help me by describing the "perfect" spot weld?  I read this whole thread twice, but am needing more information.  What settings are people using on a 3S lipo for 0.15mm or 0.13mm (0.005") pure nickel, 4ms and 2x?  It is natural that one of the two spots has a heavier weld than the other due to the direction of the current flow and voltage drop between the two points, right?  If not, what might be wrong that one spot is always a bit heavier?  If one of the two spots doesn't always rip off when peeling off the test sample though one always does, do I necessarily need more flux time?The following picture shows some sample welds.  All were done on 4ms flux time, though the outside set were on x2 and the inside set (closer to the center of the battery) were done on x1.![Welds, 4 4 18|281x500](upload://pHG6DxTFUvjknpBVLr1zKFMDOwY.jpg)

I've used the Bolt series high voltage (LiHV) packs, and they've lasted longer then regular lipos as far a cycles... But only if you charge them like a lipos (4.20v max instead of 4.35v) otherwise, don't get a HV pack unless you plan on treating it like a lipo

Took some setting adjustment at first but. .15 nickel strip on .2mm copper.  I used the heat gun@750f about one inch from the strips.  I just wore a glove under the latex glove for the heat.  It makes a decent amount.  Burned spots in the wood block I was working on.  With no heat and same settings it was a weak weld.  With heat there were no Sparks and no holes in either the strip or copper.  I had to rip off the tabs with pliers.

The first weld prepares the metal and the second...makes It firm.
It is unnecessary unless you need to improve the welds. For thick metal, copper, low performance lipos etc.. is recommendable or even mandatory.

Depends on the pattern. For side bend you need more than 2. For a common pattern one layer is enough. Make sure you understand the difference between layers and number of strips per series.
For parallel one layer is always enough as the power transfer is very low between cells.

This tip suggests that I could connect 5 parallel cells with just one 0,15 nickel strip and then put some 8AWG wire on one end for series connection and I’m set. In this scenario every nickel strip counting from last cell opposite of 8AWG wire would carry current of all previous cells. There is no such thing as common pattern and this information is just dangerous.

With a 30Q that can unload 15-20A per cell it sounds way to thin with just one 0.15. It’s not current between the cells that’s the problem it’s the current going FROM the cells to the load that is. When doubling strips is it just to weld one layer, add next, weld and so on?

Then, you’ll need some kind of bussbars or pretty thick bussplates. For 2 18650 high I’d go this way but with perforated 2mm copper plate with no ventilation holes (to save space as there is 15mm x 2mm copper needed) and 4 circular connections soldered to it from every cell, cell connection spot welded. For safety you should cross calculate copper thickness with few pcb copper thickness calculators but I’m sure that 4 x 0,15 nickel strips will give you safe 20Amps per 30Q cell as they max out at 7A each. Cable for such a current is another story as it’d need 6AWG copper which is almost finger thick [[source](http://www.solar-wind.co.uk/cable-sizing-DC-cables.html )].

So, I've looked at the same charts and I still don't see anyone mentioning the 6ga wire for this kind of amp draw.  Just think about lipo wires.  Huge amps but maybe 8ga?  I'm guessing more people are building packs around continuous use.  The down side being extra heat built up in the series connections whatever it be.

So 160a burst for a few seconds with less series amp carrying capacity than the full 160a

I assumed 1m cable length and 1% acceptable lossess, large overkill for eskate but nothing fancy for constant use.
There is 9 to 6 AWG drop when you increase cable lenght from 0,5m to 1m in that calc below. I suppose that’s why we use alternating current to transport energy on long distances. But as you say: those values are for constant use, we can easily scale down a little but I’ve seen many burned nickel connections on endless sphere.

First thanks @aulakiria for sharing his invention. 
Is it possible or wise to run lower voltage than 3S? If so why and how many Amps are recommended as a minimum at 3S to work this devise. What would happen if Amps are too low? Just a bad weld/slower work process or damage to the devise/battery.

thanks to anyone for replying

I= V/R, so current is directly proportional to voltage. This means if you lower voltage, current goes down.

Plus the voltage might be too low for the brains parts to work.

(EDIT sorry nasty typo in the formula)

Still waiting on my battery to come in so I went looking for some heatsinks to attach the unit. 
Tried the intel stock cpu cooler and it was a bit too large to lay flat on the cooling surface. AMDs stock cooler for the phenom II generation fit FLUSH! ![20180416_183733|281x500](upload://eppCNXlJ4cQyHv57OpmnWXLeLwx.jpg)
Slapped some thermal paste on it and super glued the flat spots of the aluminum cooling fins to the unit.![20180416_183833|281x500](upload://g9O8micriPgcckgoDOn6TFzLgGa.jpg)
Only downside is I can't really lay the unit on its back anymore or else the fan will be blocked

Personally i do get rather uncontrollable welds. Maybe my electrodes, how I hold them or press them against nickel are not perfect.. third option im not entirely clear about is whenever fat from fingers affect welds too.. i tried to rub with alcohol before welding but im not sure it helped that much..

So personally i dont get what i was aiming for.. though your situation and battery choice might be didferent and u might get different results..maybe i havent quite cracked the "code" yet.. but i either had weak welds or ones where strip changed color around weld spots..

Would go with 3s looking at it now..

3s Will be easier for nickel. I never tested 4s on nickel because i have 3&4s. I am pretty sure Lee managed to do It.
I think It is doable yet probably difficult to master.
okami said low ms have no effect and high ms make holes. Yes, It was like that with my tests with aluminium. It depends on the battery, the strips etc... I'd start with 3s for nickel and test later the copper.
The pressure is also important. Nickel needs some pressure, no need to press too 
 much. Copper needs quite some pressure though. A bad contact ends Up on a guaranteed hole.

Another gem from the monster thread. Poster did some experimentation with heat spread to what's under the nickel with soldering and with spot welding. Easily repeatable to verify on our own. Seems quite safe to solder copper on top of nickel even direcly over the cell -- with good technique.

I tested with 4s lipo, though only half charged (15.4v).  Results were very good, similar to 3s, though I found flux time best at around 1.5ms.  I examined the welds at 200x magnification and they looked the same as on 3s lipo if you lower flux time.

By the way, the S2 is awesome.  I had a Sunkko 709A and it was terrible.

I think 0.1 is the Safe zone. I do not recommend any thicker copper strips. The difficulty, Heat and Risk are too high above 0.1 It is really not worth It.
I did 0.05 0.1 and 0.2 and by far the BEST is 0.1
I also remind everyone once again that this machine is NOT designed for copper but nickel. 
It is capable but the intense use for copper could reduce the lifespan of the fets.
Everyone Who dares to engage a copper job must keep that in mind. 
Also i think any flux time above 10ms at 16v is a machine killer. If your machine can't weld under 10ms i advice to stop. I do not own the latest version though. I am talking about my experience with the first model.

I assume that the smoke of burnt electronics and a “FET error” message is a bad start? :p It was welding fine until I started messing with the settings. I set 4x , 4ms and voltage to 11 (upped from 7v smt assuming this was low voltage cut off). When I tried to weld after setting this nothing happend. After a little while it rebooted and started to smell burnt electronics showing a FET error message in the display. Did I mess up some setting?

Well im not super sure what to recommend as i didnt get satisfying enough results myself..

 Not sure whenever it is my technique but non the less something seems a bit off with my heavy duty 5ah 4s battery setup

Edit: I think continous should be at around 300A minimum, more or less. Though burst current is the one we need / use for welding

I’ve done that. I did check the board closer now and there is a burnt trace with one of those metal standoffs going straight over it. Wonder if that could have shortened the trace to ground somehow. When I power it up now I notice that the voltage regulator goes really hot in seconds so I guess it’s not only the FETs that need replacement :( Will def replace that metal standoff with a nylon one on my next one if that’s the case..

I also got really wide .2 nickel, 26mm wide. So insteald of doing series+parallel connections as a lattice in 2 layers, just do one big sheet. I think it'll handle 30q current easily. Also still experimenting.

the nickel and about half of the 18650 cell get hot. The probe tips get warm with one weld at that energy level. The wires, fuses and connectos are the next thing to heat up. The fets don't really get a chance to get hot as everything else gets hot first.

kweld kind of has HUGE electrode tips compared to the BOSS. In a way the boss electrodes are more precise and easier to place. Don't really want to pollute this thread with kweld, but I thought people might be interested about what it seems to take to weld .3mm nickel. If you want more thoughts maybe in PM?

It's awesome that there are so many viable options for 18650 spot welding.

My theory is, I think there may be capacitors to hold the voltage feeding the arduino up while battery voltage sags during the weld. If the power source sags too much, arduino loses power and reboots.

Sucks that i had to fork up another $95 for a new unit after just testing it slightly but I don’t like to shout warranty to nice developers that does this on their spare time..

I got one of these a few weeks back and it's great.  I still need it for my battery pack, but once I'm done with it I'm planning on selling mine so if someone wants to buy it in a month or so when I'm finished shoot me a PM.  Also I ordered a heatsink and some fans like in the first post, to make it operate cooler.

i got this battery and the welder starts working nicely at around 8ms, 2x pulse, and 3ms 
which is a lot IMO
with .15 pure nickel
but it works very nicely so i wont complain

Yes. It is a lot. 0.15 can be handled with just 4 ms with my nanotech. I was expecting much more from that lipo. Nevertheless high flux times on 3s are not a problem. If you are making nice welds you are fine with that.

Everything is worth noting I guess. I was using two old zippy flightmax 45c 3s 5000’s. I had to turn up the welder to 7.0 just to get he first strip on my parallel group to weld properly. Then 2x pulse and 11ms to get nickel on nickel.

So I swapped in my dynamite 3s 5000 50c batteries which are much newer, more balanced and have a way higher burst rating. All is good in the world. 1x 5.0ms for first layer now and 2x 7.0ms for nickel on nickel. I’m using strips from supower 10mm wide and .15 thick.

*edit* batteries in parallel

nickel to nickel seems very very difficult to get a good strong weld. Much different from welding to an actual cell.

I've had better luck welding 2 layers of nickel to steel in one shot, than 1 layer to steel, then later another nickel layer.

Right, just be careful when you weld to cell, as I've found you need a lot more power for nickel to nickel, so if you use same power to weld to cells, you may blow holes in stuff.

I did the test outdoors under the Sun so the settings can't be seen easily.
I started from 4ms X2 Up to 9ms
I think 4-5 ms X2 is enough. Beyond 7ms is too deep with my setup. Notice that nickel on nickel might need higher flux. If you weld on the same spot that you used for the cell will be easier though

That's kweld. I agree with rojitor, I think the thin one hand electrodes are easier. But no doubt the kweld one is beefy and tough. XT150 connectors crimped onto thick copper rod. I think it's the 3rd iteration of kweld's electrode design. I need to try shaving the tips down.

I wanted to post the results of my research and experiences in case someone can benefit from it.  Though I am an engineer, these results are not necessarily proper test results, partially since the tests are not complete or performed under proper controlled conditions, so please keep that in mind.  Also as you will see, some of my research is still completely inconclusive.  Part of the reason why I wanted to publish early though is because I have tested three S2s and many cells to failure (partially due to my ignorance and haste), and figured some of you might like to spare yourself that expense and also be wary of the potential for serious bodily and other harm.  Below I talk about welding copper, but as aulakiria says, the machine was not designed to weld copper, and as rojitor says, IT IS DANGEROUS to both you, your property, and your machine, so proceed at your own risk.  I only mention the below for those of you who will experiment on copper regardless of my post.  I am not advocating it, and I bear no responsibility for what could happen.  You could literally burn your house down, or seriously injure yourself, even mortally so.  

Some of the below is applicable to quality, consistent welds with nickel, too.

Firstly, what does a good weld look like?  To answer that question, I think you need to look at welds at about 200x magnification as in the following pictures.  If you can't, the key is to:
1.  Use the minimum flux time and repeats (e.g. 2x or maybe 3x) needed to make the metal strip tear away from the battery leaving two holes (with no/minimal burning of the metal), AND
2.  Ensure you have enough battery power and cooling to keep it that way.
Settings one day, or settings after things heat up or battery voltage drops will not be the same as settings another.

Here is a picture of a decent weld, but I think a little too hot at the upper right side of the weld:
![2017-12-24-00-14-17|690x388](upload://3SI97B7japRQ8Uq8wAYGPX0WYWs.jpg)
I'm personally not concerned about heat to the battery since I beleive it trivial (though i only make one or two welds per cell then allow the cell time to cool), but it is likely that the dark brown/black part is where the metal is burned away.  Where there is no metal, no current will flow, potentially resulting in excessive voltage sag and other problems.  Here is an exaggeration to show it (really bad weld, this one partially off the + button of the cell):
![2017-12-28-02-29-56|690x388](upload://dzI0PDejY9OhJAvu0lE9b1I5Lth.jpg)

Concerning my recommendation #2, above, cooling and consistent battery power is critical to consistent good welds since they tend to get worse over time during the weld series.  In my experience to produce consistent welds when welding 0.1mm copper, you need at least 10Ah of high-quality 4S cells.  5AH will give you a small number of good welds (maybe 25 welds?), but then you have to let things cool for 45 minutes or more.  As a result, I use 20Ah of 4S cells, which produce far more reliable welds for copper.

For cooling when welding copper, you will need to add a heat sink and 12 volt or higher fans.  I use this heat sink: http://a.co/j1XGmmQ.  You can use 3/4" #4 wood screws to hold the fans on (assuming 10mm deep fans).  Wood screws mean you don't have to tap the holes--just screw them in.  Mine looks like this, where one fan is pushing and one is pulling air, and I use tape to seal the heat sink to make a duct.

Perhaps one fan would be sufficient, but you should have the fan(s) push air toward the batteries since they will normally get hotter than the welder.  Though it looks huge compared to the machine, this heat sink barely keeps the FETs cool enough at 75 degrees F ambient temperature.

Since pressure on the welding tips is important, I also like to modify Lee's design by removing most of the (typically blue) heat shrink that holds the two tips together.  The result is easier-to-accomplish even-pressure contact, kind of like an independent rear suspension on a car rather than a solid rear axle.  Here is how I modify them--you will notice only one little 1/8" band of heat shrink holding the tips together: ![20171226_182629|690x388](upload://lczYJoWnwIj7W2lG3P1g63A6uBu.jpg)

As others have pointed out, the tips get very hot when welding copper.  They also get worn down quickly.  As a result you will need at least two sets.  It seems Lee uses 14 gauge half-hard copper to make the tips.

Speaking of tips, here are some particularly important results from research, though testing is short since I am awaiting replacement FETs.  In an effort to increase weld consistency, I made some new tips using 6 gauge copper leads and 12 gauge half-hard copper tips.  Using the normal settings, I tried them and blew a large hole in the battery!  Needless to say I was quite surprised by the difference in performance.  After turning flux time way down I made some successful high-quality welds but then got the fatal "FET error!!!" message.  I made a few more welds on a different S2, then tried to weld two strips of 0.1mm copper together.  I turned flux time up to 5ms, pressed my foot pedal switch, and proceeded to blow a 1/4" hole in the copper, PLUS the welder would not shut off and burned out the FETs on my last (third) welder.  As a result, research on the upgraded leads and tips is inconclusive.

Last tip on copper: a switch or foot pedal is required rather than using automated welds.  It is too dangerous and error-prone without a manual switch.  I recommend a foot pedal since it is convenient to use.

Please read the above 800+ posts to get more information on the things that I have not discussed in detail.

So why all of this danger and effort to weld copper?  I would love for someone to convince me otherwise, and assuming manufacturer claims of 70A/3,000W per e-skate motor are accurate, engineering theory would suggest that nickel as we use it cannot transfer 140A (70A x 2) without very significant voltage sag.  Significant voltage sag means performance (e.g. skateboard acceleration) is significantly reduced.

I'd love to hear advice or corrections from others.

Thanks to @aulakiria for creating such a great and inexpensive machine (immensely better than my Sunkko, which was unusably bad).  Thanks also to @rojitor to bringing the S2 to our attention and for all of the tips and instructions.  Both are sincerely appreciated. 

I hope this helps someone.  Good luck, and stay safe!

Goodie :) I noticed that the fuse in the toy car is 13A so it's not like it's gonna pull hard on that pack.. She drove 2-3km today and it dropped 3.1Ah off the 15Ah pack so it's pretty solid. 

It heated quickly when I welded so I figured I had to design a cooling solution. I want to avoid a fan so I just added a good chunk of aluminum to it with some fins there in case I want a fan for longer weld sessions. 6mm was the smallest in the toolchanger atm so I didn't bother making the fins smaller ^^ Hope it will help.

I had to wait a lot today welding a 3S5P battery so I wanted to solve this.. Machined this piece for passive cooling. I could now do 25 quick welds on 4s - 5ms with the temp rising only from 22 to 28 degrees but the tip was way to hot to hold so the limit is not the  fets anymore. Prolly way overkill with the 30mm thick plate but now it's more stable on the desk also :)

Yes i know what you mean. When you start you don't feel like rushing even if you are. The first simptom is the Heat on the fets, i see you solved that part with that wonderful sink you have made. The second is Heat on the tips, on 4s is way more noticeable than 3s. The tips are kind of easy to replace anyway. Just desolder and solder another copper rod or cut the damaged part and bend them again. They become shorter but still good to go.

To make It properly you need to scratch the strips deeply. The best way is grinding with a dremel or making some holes with a drill. The soul must be exposed for the rust to come out.

I wouldn't use any more flux time or multiple.  Though I'm confident this battery is OK for its intended use, it looks like some of the welds are partially burning through, which means you are not getting optimal current transfer from the welds.  It looks like you may be having some weld consistency problems, too, which is common.  I haven't completely figured out how to get ultimate in consistency, but not overworking/overheating the battery(ies) and keeping the FETs at low and stable temperature definitely helps.

Don't worry, it's not the end of the world. Plated is not as good as pure but It does the job. I used plated for parallel and pure for series several times. No problem at all. I bet most chinese battery packs use plated and that's not an issue. If they fail is because the cells suck. If you hesitate on the efficiency of the power transfer just add more layers.

Same crap as mine then but I couldn’t fix it with a wire :( the arduino was overloading the power supply so there was something more that went shit. Are you sure it’s shorted there or is it just positive on the standoff? Anyways not a good design to do it like that. If anything those standoff’s should be grounded. I replaced one of mine with plastic but I did not spot this exact spot so now I will replace all of them (if they are not used for grounding anything). 

Yeah I didn’t want to try to pull warranty. It’s a nice design and cudos to him for sharing it so I think it’s better that I report back the issue and then hopefully he fixes it for later ones. Wish I got some more discount on it but I did not want to discuss and pull out time just to save a few bucks ^^

The fan from that port works when the temperature goes above the settings and stops when within security range again. It is better a continuous fan or heatsink if you want to go faster.

ok... so i got batteries finally...and got to doing some testing with the welder... try some nickel on nickel like everyone else...test times... checking this n that.. so a couple questions to make sure my mind is right...

1- the multi stage spot welding setting....i dont know if i understand it 100%
this is if you want to rip down a line real quick weld after weld right?? but it goes to 6x.. so does that mean you could only rip off 6 quick welds before youd need to break for a sec...and then how does that relate, if at all, to the auto weld wait time?

2 - no burning... so is the best way to incrementally increase the weld time on a piece of test nickel over a bare surface (cardboard, wood, whatever other non metal surface) until scorching appears from the underside? or topside?

if anyone needs more info im using this strip for my build:

![14 PM|690x431](upload://65fNzKXiwACwo6vFRhAH0iVVhaA.jpg)

i feel like this is bit thicker than the nickel that comes with the kit...

Mm that battery has a tiny burst. I Hope It works.
Multistage makes several pulses in a row the first one prepares the nickel and then you finish the job. Usually X2 is enough.
The courtesy nickel strips sent by Lee are 0.1 plated. Are meant to be tested. Not good for our batteries. Use at least 0.15. pure is better.
Test those strips on a Blade. When you see black marks underside you should stop increasing ms. If you Burn or make holes upside you are destroying It. Decrease ms. They must stick firm but the metal and so the cell must not take damage. Find the balance.

Hello @rojitor, unfortunately ATM I only have a 4s Lipo battery, but I plan to work only on 0.15mm nickel, according to your first post, 4S could be dangerous for cells/welder and could spit a lot of sparks. 

Looking at the options, on the welder setup you can change the value of lipo voltage, I wonder if it does mean that the maximum voltage max can limited? For instance, would it be possible to limit the maximum voltage of a 4S battery to only 11.8V to act as a 3s?

Sorry if this has been asked before.

I believe the voltage setting is only for the alarm. The mosfets are opening or closing over time so it can’t do anything with the voltage by design. Voltage in is going to be voltage out over X time.

No. Voltage can't be límited. 4s is dangerous if you use high flux times. For 0.15 you will need very low ms so no dangerous at all. It will be way more difficult though. You are a very experienced builder so i think you can máster It in no time.
Just make some testing and you will be fine.

Are the points touching each other? If that's the case you are making the short before the nickel and the weld will not happen.
You can reuse the 8awg wire and replace the points. Just desolder them and add new copper points. Or shorten them if you still have some travel. 
One soul copper rod 1-1.5mm Will make good points.

yeah just knocked out 2 builds with this... quite happy... for the .15 strip and the battery i was using above..the second build had better welds at 6ms 2x .... going to 3x at same or less power wasnt as necessary..... also as the welder got hotter i found quality of weld started to suffer a hair....


also did any one else notice this? I was using auto.... but at a real slow delay like 2.7 sec so i could get the probes laid out right across the split...  but if i made a touch..and slipped... but pulled the probes back off before the weld happened... then re-applied the probes to the nickel it was as iff my timer didnt reset the count at zero... thus making a the spark with what ever time was remaining... and usually melting some shit....  

my main work around for this...was if i made a false start..to pull back...and turn the welder off and back on...

other wise...very happy and it just paid for itself

Have you guys had issues where the spot welder just makes the beep but not weld at all? It start happening after a couple of sparks I got on a test welding procedure. BTW I'm only using a 12v power supply instead of the 19v recommended by @rojitor

Btw these the copper teminals came kinda rounded at the tips, is this how you suppose to receive them from the factory? Or I need to sharp the points?

Copper requires 4s. 3s has no effect at all.
When the battery is full i use 8ms X2 and after a bunch of welds i rise to 9ms. If the job is Big i refuel the lipo once or twice. It is important to have it fully charged.
I use 3 pens at a time. I swap pen every 20 welds +- and i place them close to the fans so while i cool the fets i cool also the tips. I can make the job quite fast (relatively)

I made this out of wood.  Works real good as a tray for gluing and if you flip the batteries on their side for welding as well.

I also use it for cutting the nickel strips.  I marked the board for certain lengths.  Then you hold your scissors against the wood side and slide the nickel to the mark on the board.  Perfect cuts every time in rapid succession.

Make sure the contact is perfect and the pressure is good. Bad pressure will burn the metal and bad contact/pressure will make holes, HUGE holes that would pierce the can and ruin the cell.

I think so. Success on blade has been guaranteed  success on cell so far for me. I am not sure about the exact thickness but i can tell from personal experience that the blade test works.
Nickel on nickel or copper on copper have nothing to do with that test and may differ with the results on that field.

Beware that. The welds are better when the points are close but they must never ever touch each other. Specially on 4s. Using high ms on 4s(copper) It could be an Epic fail. Guaranteed destruction of the pen.
Just a look at the shrink every now and then is always a good option.

Two standoff wich has Connection to the ground planer, is shorting to plus
[/quote]

 Had the same issue with mine, but luckily I saw you post bevore conecting with the lipo :sweat_smile: 

For anyone with the same problem, here is how I fixed it without changing the stand offs: 
First I have loosen the srews and lift up the stand off by rotating, so it wont touch the plate anymore.
![IMG_20180605_121049|666x500](upload://fVL3PJx55KgSVC9UpsgKjriw7Ud.jpg)
and then filled the gap with some heat resistance isolating tape stuff 
![IMG_20180605_121804|666x500](upload://gtp4HsZh7FkmKuiNymhgz9P1oW6.jpg)
Did that on both sides 
![IMG_20180605_123058|666x500](upload://yMieJ6inV5SVBSkSZgkiqnYTBhx.jpg)

Thats it!  It does not short  anymore and it is an easy and fast fix.

Edit: :sweat_smile: just saw that @Deckoz recomended  already the same

What do you mean by "i had the same issue"?
Did you have a short or the standoffs were touching the contacts?
The standoffs have always touched the contacs. My machine does. The PCBs are protected so nothing "should" happen. Lee got a small batch of faulty PCBs that's why some units failed. That doesn't mean everybody has to mod the machine.
Nevertheless Lee is working on a solution for possible future problems. He is very busy ATM and will announce It when ready.

I said, shipping was more than that, it got increased a bit, plus you have to add some for PayPal fees.

I sold it to him for $120 shipped, so after PayPal I got like $115 and shipping will be like $12, so closer to $100.  Tell me how me charging less than he would of gotten charged had he ordered directly from the maker is unfair exactly?? Not seeing your logic.  Also, mines never even been used, so no argument there...

![Screenshot_20180608-151815|508x500](upload://pn1s9SNSwKKuyTlEcqopoumxnEZ.jpg)

$95 - Full Set
$ 6.18 - PayPal Fee and USD to Korean Exchange
$29 - Shipping
-------
$130. 18

This is actually a few dollars short, I remember it being like $132 - $135, I think the 3.5% PayPal fee and the 3% exchange rate fee were separate so they covered different amounts.  Regardless, yes its less than $137, I don't know why I put that amount I made the add rather hastily, but still, I sold it for less than anyone could get it for, even if the shipping hadn't increased :wink:

The maelectrics welder is awesome. I now know what went wrong when I blew the hole in the battery :smiley:
Always apply pressure on the welds. When you weld and the strip doesn't make proper contact to the battery/nickel below it, you get a big spark and mess things up. Thats not maelectrics fault.

I recieved my battery today and was just trying this out, all was going good in the automatic weld mode until I plugged in the switch. I did about three welds and then a pop and the magic white smoke. 

![image|375x500](upload://aDd3y6OZVQkG91RBFlOzuU8dRtP.jpeg)

It still welds in automatic mode, but the manual switch no longer works. Pressing the encoder still changes from one setting to the next, but there’s no response when turning the encoder. 

@aulakiria is there anyway I can fix this? :disappointed_relieved:

I think @Eboosted had a similar problem. I see you have the metal standoffs. The PCBs are protected but seems lee got a faulty batch of them. Now he is using nylon standoffs and the problem is solved but maybe you got one of the faulty PCBs. Mail lee. He does not read the forum everyday.
Btw i see you have not heatsinks or fans. Have you set fets temperature under 50°?

There are two ways to repair.

One more thing I'm using settings 4ms for .15 pure nickel and I'm not getting any welds just sparks and sometimes the nickel will stick to the tips. I got my welder second hand so maybe it has an issue. Or could it be my tips are too messed up? When I got it the tips were mushroomed out and almost touching I used sand paper to fix it best I could but maybe it's still a problem.

What's your lipo? 4ms is usually enough for 0.15 but that depends on the lipo.
Are your wires jumping? They MUST JUMP.  At least one of them must jump. The amps are not going where they should otherwise.
Make sure the tips are clean without scraps of PVC and have a perfect Contact with the nickel.
Also make sure the pressure is correct.

[quote="linsus, post:710, topic:25980, full:true"]
So…just curious…why aren’t you using lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cells like the A123 for the welder?.. The high powerdensity of those cells must be ideal for this application?
[/quote]

[quote="rojitor, post:711, topic:25980, full:true"]
Because they are way more expensive than a lipo brick and you need a spot welder beforehand to make the pack.
I recall some member time ago Who wanted to do It.
I dunno if he did It or not.
Super capacitors is also an option. I think someone has done It with this machine.
[/quote]

I was the one who wanted to do it ages ago, but only got around to actually trying it out recently.

It works, but I tried it out with a 3s5p LiFePO4 pack, not 4s as I should've done. 4s was the intention, and cells ordered as such, but I made an attempt to see if I could solder the cells together, so I tried it on a 1s5p pack and failed. Even cleaning the contacts with denatured alcohol, sanding them to create a better surface area, and using flux didn't help the solder stick like it should to the cells. I ended up ruining the cells so I was left with a 3s5p pack and resorted to ordering a lipo to spot-weld.

Because of the lower voltage of the 3s LiFePo4 pack, I had to set the voltage alarm to a lower setting to get the spot-welder to work. The timings I used were 12ms x1x1 for one strip of 0.15T x 12mm nickel, and 15ms x1x1  for the second strip, welding to a razor blade. Result was really good though. Solid welds both times.

Talk about an expensive experiment :expressionless: ...

My advice : if someone wants to do it, it's possible but if you don't have a spare 3s lipo lying around and don't want to shell out for one, get a LiFePo4 pack made by a pro. And go 4s5p at the very least.

Sorry for interrupting. Back to your regular scheduled programming :yum:.

It's weird but light pressure works better.

sparks usually means either not pure nickel, or dirty or bad contact. Hm or maybe if the electrodes are too close together it's arcing between them...

The corrosion test does not work if you do not grind the nickel properly. 
Drill a hole or use a dremel. The soul must be exposed or you Will not succeed on the test.
Too many sparks weld? = Plated
Too many sparks no weld? = Bad contact, pressure...

putting together a 12s6p right now, performed about 1200 welds and not single issue so far.

i did notice the tips get damaged pretty quickly though, i've had to either snip off, or resurface the tips every 200 welds or so.  when the tips get worn, it was blowing holes through the nickel.  the moment the tip got reconditioned, it went back to perfect welds.

at this rate i'm going to have to get new tips so looking forward to your video.

also, are you doing well with your recovery?

The points must have a gap of 1mm or the weld will not happen, also if they are too separated the weld will be weak. They must be clean to perform as we expect so i recommend a sandpaper around. 
If you work fast the pen will heat a lot and the tips will pay for it, Use several pens or stop every now and then. Rub gently the tips every few welds.
You can round the tips but eventually they will sharpen as you use the pen.
Make sure the tips do not touch each other, you could damage them, besides the weld will not happen it they short before the nickel.
Lee makes them similar to this method.
He uses salvaged breadboards and i think 1.5 copper rod. 
I hope it helps guys.

When you press the tips can move. If they are too close they don't weld. If they touch they damage each other, if that happens at the very end of the tip= hole.
I guess that was your problem. Make sure the gap when pressing is 1 mm and you Will be fine. For nickel the pressure must be firm enough to make both electrodes and nickel+steel be in perfect contact but no need to make a hard pressure. (Copper does) just by practicing you can master It in no time.

Quick review and thoughts:
I got new version (with plastic spacers) and I'm using Turnigy Graphene Lipo 3s 5000mah 65-130C. Welds with nickel 0.1mm tape are super easy and even with 1ms they stick hard(blade or 18650 cell). What I found out there is sweet spot with pressure force applied: when welds are clean and there are no sparks occurring thats the one. About tip spacing, did test with 3mm gap with no problems at all, only a little longer time is needed. Automatic function is super convenient. It would be nice if there was an option to calibrate battery readings, my unit adds 0.1-0.2V(according to reading from mulitmeter Aneng 8008).
Overall for this price the welder is AWESOME and I cannot wait to test it with 0.15 and 0.2 nickel :slight_smile: 
Thank You for excellent work Aulakiria!

I  am not sure if anyone did. I did 0.5 and It sucked. Maybe 0.3 is worth It. You will probably need 4s for that but again i dunno. I never tested It and no one reported feedback about It.
I did:
0.1 perfect
0.15 perfect
0.20 perfect
 Aluminium terrible not recommended
0.1 copper difficult. Doable. Warning.
0.2 copper very difficult and dangerous. Don't
Nickel on copper. Difficult. Doable
Copper on copper. Difficult. Bad quality.
I wanted to test many other metals but copper is so damn good that i lost interest.
I recommend to stick to 0.2 nickel. Easy and healthy for the machine.
Going beyond that forces the machine to the limit. Reduces lifespan of the fets and is way more difficult, dangerous and expensive.
Several layers of 0.2 can do the same job so explore the limits at your own Risk.

Here's some tips available from another commerical Arduino product
https://malectrics.eu/product/arduino-spot-welder-welding-cable-set/

Personally I would make my own when the time comes crimping copper into small bullets, maybe 3D printing a holder for the tips to set the gap nicely and make it comfortable to the hand

Since there has been talk of other Ardruino welders and if you have the time, skill, a 3D printer, don't need or want soldering function & need to keep costs to a bare mimimum then there is the possibility to make your own welder

I purchased .2x 25mm pure nickel to make a double stack battery, I hope 4 meters would be enough for me to do some testing and then make a giant battery. 

Btw my Soldering iron doesn't get very hot I've tried multiple ac adapters from 19v to 29v adaptor and it barely gets hot enough to melt solder on it's own.

Check the power on the label of your the power supply.
It's not only a matter of voltage.

Check the label on the power brick. Want 19+v and about <del>60+watts</del> 70+watts for max heat.

EDIT i was reviewing the official page at https://blog.naver.com/aulakiria/220992039512

There's a photo saying ~35v, and some text that says 19v or greater, 80w.

The T12 tips are for Hakko FX-951, and official specs for the iron are:

24v (possibly AC), 70w.

The station itself is spec'ed for 75w.

When I did my battery I had 2 layers in paralelle with 3x welds each. Thats 576 welds for paralelle only and then i used 8x on the series connection with 3welds on each end so thats 576 welds there. When you get quicker at it and ambient is high it’s increasing quickly. If you weld slowly it might work but I would rather strap some cooling on it instead of breaking it due to heat. This was with 0.2mm strip and 4S 9000mAh 65C.

The problem once cooling of the electronics is sorted is that the tips get to hot to touch and they get soft :( Next job is to make a second set of the tips..

I use fans to cool my unit. I used small heatsinks when i started.... Nice but not enough. I see some users succeded with huge heatsinks. I have a very high opinion about them but the size matters for me. It's funny...my wife says the same... Dunno why.
In my experience slow jobs on cool weather need no cool at all, fast Jobs need cooling, and copper needs xtreme kewl.
Depends on the thickness and number of welds/minute.
Everyone has to find the right path.

IMO the cells will get hotter when being used on our boards than from 4 small welds if it heats the ends of the cells to 60celsius or whatever it will dissipate and the whole cell will be at like 30  or lower but nvm, wont risk buying 10meters and not being able to weld it

25mm is sweet. Can use for double stack, or for foldover. A lot more conductor than criss crossed skinng strips. And stacked nickel, the welds just don't seem super consistent, at least not as consistent as non stacked.

Or for flex packs, for each p-proup, fold the excess over (put fish tape under) and solder copper braid or 12/10awg for series connections.

The lipo is brand new. The points are polished and have 2mm gap point-to-point.  I feel like I somehow have an underpowered welder. I don't see how you can get welds with 8ms x2 when I can't with 16ms x6. That's like 6x more energy put in.

Is anyone who already has this welder willing to test mine? I will ship it to you on my dime with some of my 0.2mm strips.

OK, first battery build.  Using the boss spot welder.

I spent some time playing with the welder and a razor knife to test the settings and arrive at a decent weld.

Right now I'm using 10ms, 2 pulses 3ms apart

These settings gave me good welds on the razor knife.

Results:

I am sorry for the confusion.

I marked the maximum voltage as 35v.
However, the manufacturer's standard is 24v.
I recommend a voltage of around 24v.

The output of the 10s charger is 42v.

i'm loving it so far, and tips are trivially easy to replace.

oh, the tips are spring loaded so you can apply nice, even pressure on the tips, yielding very nice results.

as of now, since it's new, i'm finding it kind of cool to have.  maybe the novelty may wear off after some time.

the real benefit is there is solid contact across the two probes even if you don't apply even pressure.  like a suspension, it levels itself.  so the welds are coming out more consistent than solid probes.

My pen is not the same model. Sunkko and 50$ too yet not the same.
The screws broke on the first day. I put better ones and the threads broke too. The metal is like butter. Xtreme low quality. The tips come out all the time. They move left to right spoiling the welds..... Worst investment ever.
Any of my other pens are way cheaper and better.
But i repeat. Not the same model. That pen of @thisguyhere could be perfectly fine.

Definitely. The electrodes wear unevenly so having the spring helps you apply the same pressure without placing the pen at a weird angle. The even pressure always produces a better weld. It's also useful for getting welds done in awkward spots at awkward angles.

@Erniechan and @rojitor
I have the exact same pen as @thisguyhere and its quite good. The electrodes on it are kinda crappy so I used replace them immediately with electrodes from PowerStream   (Also where I sourced nickel)

@rojitor, have you had any better luck with copper welding? have you tried tungsten electrodes? What is the max thickness you can do? I'm thinking of getting myself one of these now to do copper packs manually when my CNC machine is too busy or with really hard to handle packs

You are definetley going to need to solder some copper on the nickel strips if your careful you wont even get the solder on the cells or get them hot in any way
I would put 3 layers of the nickel strip and then just solder 2 or more flexible 1-1.5mm2 cable on it (twist it so its similar to that flat cable you can buy)

30q cells are capable of 20A without any issues like heat so you have something like a 160a battery...

that chart is ampacity across a meter.  that's a lot of material.

if 22awg copper wire can handle 20a load across a short distance, i assure you 10mm nickel can easily handle that.

i think it's less important to fortify P groups than it is on series connections.

that's to say, @Battosaii your .2mm nickel should be plenty on P groups.  but maybe double up or backup with copper on S connections.

Has anyone though on writing an opensource firmware for the welder?

The firmware is locked, so reverse engineering the hex is not an option
![image|241x500](upload://dQGH6SpFZ5EaTqNif3x4EiY0uCb.jpeg) 

For the moment I have the following pins:

    *** Pins
    D5 fan
    D10 buzzer

    *** Screen
    SCL
    SDA

    *** IR358N
    VCC NC  NET1 NET1
    )               |
    A6  NC? NET2 NET2 <- 10k -- 2n2

Why? because future upgrades, bugs, and add features:

1. Fancy UI (maybe based on [Arduboy2](https://github.com/MLXXXp/Arduboy2)?)
2. Named profiles
3. Smooth/averaged for soldering temperature indicator
4. Options for boot sound/graphics and other
5. Anything...

Hello guys:
I'm having issues with the spot welder not welding correctly?, hope you guys help me setting it correctly or tell me what could be wrong with it.

Here are my settings:
![image|690x388](upload://gOzL5nUcAT72PM0f9TlCwIdAsiW.jpeg) 

I'm using:
TURNIGY HEAVY DUTY 5000MAH 4S 60C LIPO PACK
0.15mm pure nickel strips

The welds stick together after each weld but I can easily pull them with my bare hands without too much effort, it used to weld pretty good at 3ms but now at 4ms the welds are pretty poor, not sure if I just need to rause the welding time or there's might be something else.

If you have a razor blade test the welds and settings on that till you get a good weld.

I just made a new pen, bought a piece of 3/16" copper rod, cut off two 4" lengths, soldered some 8AWG Silicone wire to them, and wrapped them up good with heat shrink. For a bit of grip I used a few zipties to give some grip and hold them tight together. It does really nice welds now and I have lots of copper to file off. 

I really like how flexible the wire is now too.

The discharge is rated at 50c for the battery that Im using. I understand that the minimum required is 40c.

It restarts or resets as in it turns off then turns back on again without completing the weld.

The continuous C is irrelevant. Burst is the only thing that matters. The welder restarts because has no power. That battery is not suitable for welding. Pick a better one.
High capacity and high burst.
Recommended 5000mah 60+ C burst
So far hobbyking nanotech and graphene seem to be the safest bet.
Take a look at this thread.

Just watched your video. No doubt. That battery is not( by far) enough for the task. Also you are grabbing wrong the Pen. You need to make way more pressure. Put your finger on the shrink on the tips. Use rubber gloves if you want protection. 
Also nickel on nickel can be more difficult than nickel on cell. 4ms for nickel on nickel is ok only if you have a top quality lipo. You must rise the values or the multiplicator otherwise.
```

---
## \#1315 Posted by: Erniechan Posted at: 2018-12-03T15:43:54.575Z Reads: 184

That lipo is probably NOT 50c. Most brands state false C ratings. Besides it's not the same 8000mah 50c than 2200mah 50c just do the maths.
The shorts take a few ms therefore what you need is high burst. 
I'd buy a better lipo. 5000mah high burst.

According to aulakiria  " **You should not have black marks in too long spot welding time.**". I also used to set higher time, but his recomendation spot welding time ("0.1T was spot welded in 1.4 ms, 0.15T → 4ms, 0.2T  → 7ms) works best, welds are strong enough and it's better for cells and FETs.

This pen is my next upgrade! Right now I'm using this big old cpu cooler: it keeps temps low and welder stays stable

I haven't use mine and didn't realized what I was getting even though I already had a pretty good soldering iron. With that said, I would opt for this one over a cheap on one amazon. You want a decent iron because the cheap ones don't generally get hot enough and it just makes it incredibly annoying to solder well. You have to keep contact on your target longer, which in turn increases the risk of damaging your components.

Hi guys,

Can anyone confirm using another power source for the spot welder other than LiPo's?

Lead Acid or another Li-Ion battery bank? If so, what are the key things? Is it just a simple matter of having enough amperage? So a starter lead acid, one with sufficient CCA (200+?)? With a big enough Li-Ion battery could you pull enough charge (3s100p or something like that?)

Thanks!

don't use liion, i put together a 3s12p pack with 25r cells, still not fast enough for spot welding.  it's not just about amperage, it's more to do with how FAST the amperage is supplied.

3s100p would be impractical.

can't say anything about lead acid but that'd be impractical as well due to bulk and weight.

The sunkko at this moment is cheaper than the boss one with + lipo and a charger, any reason not to buy it this second? I was about to grab the boss, but I think work efficiency would be much faster with the sunkko?

Only an idiot would push to the limits a brand new spot welder.....well...i'm an idiot.
I've just tested copper. The results were not expected at all. 
https://youtu.be/9EMc0ZXYtC4


Testing 0.05 copper on steel. It worked surprisingly well! The boss welder can't do 0.05 properly because It breaks the strip.
I still need to figure out how to cool down the welder but it's definitely 0.05 copper capable
https://youtu.be/HTnpm8mupyc

 Even though the results look amazing the settings were absurdly high. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS. At least not out of the box. The heat rises so fast that the death of the machine is almost certain. 
Copper welding needs multi-stage to make decent welds at reasonable settings. Since the MiniSpotA lacks multi-stage the settings for 0.1 are astronomical. Even if i success cooling it down it's not 0.1 capable.

[IMG]http://i68.tinypic.com/2j332w9.jpg[/IMG]

0.05 results. If i manage somehow to tame the heat the machine is 0.05 copper capable, surpassing the Boss welder on that task.

[IMG]http://i66.tinypic.com/118g3tt.jpg[/IMG]

0.1 results. Just tested for science.

So got the spot welder a few months ago ... used it with a clearly under-powered LiPo from Amazon (even though by the specs it should have been fine) ... no problems, just bought another, more powerful one of Amazon. Seemed to work ok.

Put it down and didn't use the spot welder for a while ... but have totally been using it for the soldering station ... very, very good! Tried to do some more spot welding recently and seemed to have some sparking ... ok, no problems. Stopped using it and figured it was a battery issue again (Amazon and under-specced LiPo's) ... anyway, tried to use it for soldering a few days ago and ... not working ... little led behind the LCD comes on but nothing else. Doesn't matter if it's connected to LiPo or 19V laptop charger (for soldering).

Given a similar issue on another forum (Endless Sphere) I am assuming I have damaged the Arduino ... I will check and let you know. May need to replace it and get some firmware/files but essentially wondering want went wrong? Seems like I have a slightly under-powered battery but it shouldn't be ... even if it's under-specced it's well above whats needed. I read above something about the positive end of the welding tip having issue if it's the tip that's in less contact? Sparks and smoke? 

Anyway, little bit underwhelmed so far ... maybe it is a battery issue and I'll need to look again ... still, don't think it should be (5200mAh, 50C LiPo) that but I'll see if I can repair the Boss Welder and I'll be back.

Any tips going forward to ensure best use is greatly appreciated.

Ok, did some "testing"/inspection ... (finally got around to trying to take it apart ... tough bugger to get into).

I can't see any obvious electrical damage ... there are now nylon standoffs, not metal and that trace from Deuces seems to have changed. I don't think the Arduino is damaged ... though it's hard to initally tell as I haven't been able to de-solder the LCD to get a good look at it. 

I then got out the trusty multi-meter and thought I'd see if I can find something there ... When I plug in a 12v DC adapter (all I have tried ... it is NOT what I use to solder ... I usually use a 19V DC adapter) and test the voltage at the large leads that go directly to the soldering iron connector (the 5 pin connecter), I measure about 4.9V at the leads ... I was expecting to see higher? When I can find a 19v adapter I'll let you know if that changes.

Secondly, I attached my LiPo and measured the output at the XT90 that connects the welding pen ... and got some interesting results ... not sure if they mean anything or not but was interesting ... when my LiPo is initially connected I read 12.3V at the XT90 output, however, when I turn on the switch, and the Arduino LED goes on to show it's powered, this output drop about 2.7V ... I only read 9.6V now at the XT90 output.

This is also "post-damage" (to maybe only the LCD screen?). So I don't know if I've always been getting this voltage drop or even if it is expected ... or if it's indicative of the actual damage I may have recently done?

I'm interested to see what other people are reading at the 2 different outputs depending upon what power source they have connected ... I get feeling that the 2.7V drop is not good ... but may have less to do with my damage and more to do with poor battery?

I also am feeling like maybe the damage is just the LCD but until I de-solder it completely I will not know ... I'll report back if I can get it off.

Cheers all.

I will try a new LCD when I get home.

If you see or think a component needs to be replaced, let me know as I might be able to do that myself. Might be easier than sending it back to Korea.

Thank you.

1. If you can replace Arduino, I can send a HEX file. I need your e - mail address.

2. If you send it to Korea, I will fix it and send it to you.

Hi Lee,
Thanks for replying so quickly. I'm waiting for a 5000mah Lipo to arrive (tomorrow), will test it with that before commenting further. 

I've noticed if I use a 20C 2200mah 3S (XT60>XT90 adapter) the unit powers but never shows more than 4v. I assume the 2200mah Lipo cannot deliver enough initial current?

Have managed to change mode using button, but seems to be related to voltage.

There is something foreign inside.
So the voltage is not being measured properly.

If you clean it, it can work normally.
Otherwise, the MCU may be damaged.

It works well as a voltage divider.

Button isn't working properly either, can occasionally change the settings. Voltage reading drops after a few welds before creeping back up.

I have been testing a way to cool the device keeping the size and price. 
The fets are stuck to the aluminium plate with some thermal silicone paste. Those things require to cure to transfer the heat properly so it will work better after a few hundred welds.

the heat is very present there

![heat|420x236](upload://1Kf0fUQzL0TR0sa9mqWC7leVNSr.jpeg) 

for the spot where you place the finger just a piece of wood (icecream stick) and some shrink will do. No more heat.

![4|666x500](upload://t1bfr1wH86F3Duk4ZXLNno9J9I3.jpeg)

For the plate i got a copper ram heatsink. They are inexpensive and available at any computer store. Even online can be bought for very few bucks. [url]https://es.aliexpress.com/item/Disipador-de-calor-de-cobre-refrigerador-disipador-de-calor-adhesivo-conductor-t-rmico-para-M-2/32945025573.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.733a63c02q69LN[/url]

![5|666x500](upload://bPYnBOTl4Yp41cKbT8CbNr0mo45.jpeg) 
https://youtu.be/2vEe2MB-p78

the video is quite long and boring so in short:

I have tested 0.2mm pure nickel at 8ms 1sec delay. I did 50 welds in a row. Actually no one welds that fast when building a battery pack without professional tools so you can make more than 50 welds. Maybe an entire pack depending on size.
I pushed to the limit the welder when taping the video, please don't do that. You should stop when the temperature is above 45º celsius.
With the piece of wood and the ram heatsink any user might do a pack using 0.2 nickel. If it gets too hot let it rest for a while or place it near a fan or cold place and then you can resume the task. The purpose of this device is to be as cheap and small as possible and that has been achieved for sure. Fast performance is none of its virtues. If you need a fast job with big packs do not buy this welder, the boss welder is easy to cool and works faster.
So yeah, this device is 0.2 capable if you are not in a rush to build a pack. Many big ac spot welders can't do 0.2mm so it makes it even more impressive. I am loving it :)

I have a question regarding the minispotA. 

I've tested with my lipo (3S 70C burst nanotech 4500mah) at half charge so far, and I need 12-15ms to get solid welds with 0.15mm nickel.

Is this normal? It works, but the unit heats up pretty quick, which is no issue, besides waiting a bit for it to cool. I expected this, but it seems like others are using 5ms or so for 0.15 nickel. 

Is my batteries burst rating too low to get awesome welds at lower than 12-15ms?

I have heatsinks and thermal paste... Would this make a difference?

I should try testing with a fully charged battery I'm sure... Maybe this will make a difference as well? 

Thanks!

Tested a VRM heatsink with a cleaned and recycled sticky thermal pad.

For each test:
* 11.7-11.8v starting voltage
* 26.7°C starting temperature
* 15ms flux time
* 10 welds in rapid succession
* Pick up phone and record final temperature
* Didn't think to take a picture of how fast it cools down, say after 10 - 20 seconds. :-( may repeat for that metric at some point. 

Baseline for both tests: 
![20190319_182652|690x235](upload://r2qfGyMGLBbimlIstN6KkC83gG1.jpeg) 

First test without heatsink, final temperature: 
![20190319_182509|690x278](upload://pk8MepNpuxtGpPAZJKh82NbnAq4.jpeg) 

Then with heatsink:
![20190319_182619|690x258](upload://Ap8wHS32BnDZK62uZTD305NdwbQ.jpeg) 

It seems like it helps at least a little bit.

Weld at full charge only. Low charge makes poor welds that's why you need so high values.
That's not good for the machine at all. 4-5ms is enough for 0.15mm

That heatsink sure helps but it's too big imo. The beauty of the machine is the small size. A ram copper heatsink will cool as much as that keeping the welder at a small size. 
Keep in mind that the inner thermal paste needs to cure so you will notice a better disipation after a few hundred welds.

Hey guys, what do you think about these welds? It was done with a mini A spot welder, with welding time ranging from 4.4 to 7. Seems way too easy to peel apart with hands. At 8.5 welds started to give some resistance, but this time seems a bit high..? The nickel is not tested, but the strip is 12x0.15. My lipo has a 30-40c rating, is this too low? I think aukulela recommends the same for the boss welder.

Use the flux time you need. 8ms is not too high if you can remove the strips easily using less.
Nickel on nickel is more difficult than nickel on steel. Test it and go for it as soon as you master the flux times

Is it typical for 1 of the electrode tips to weld weaker than the other?
The pic below is with 2 welds, the electrode tips went top-bottom (well more like diagonal top-bottom), so the left electrode tip is always producing weak welds. 
![nickel%20strip|689x500](upload://v46bXpNxPylSZFAeJyvanvmMOZx.jpeg) 

The right tip welds are strong - basically need to rip the nickel to separate. The tips are identical, sanded/filed down to match. 

This is 0.15 on 0.15, 14ms x1. Battery is a 4s, 6aH 65C Turnigy Graphene. Going higher doesn't help.

Yes. This is typical in series spot welding, due to the Peltier Effect.
To get both weld nuggets the same size, try reducing the pressure on the negative electrode.

Yes it is normal. It is not good tho. You should never go above 50 celsius. Use fans strong enough or go slower. I weld copper often on 4s and i never reach 40 celsius. My unit is still working even if it is probably the most abused boss welder in the world.

Show us your tips. I can’t tell if they are too close or far away. The tips are very important.

Darkened tips=no weld

Too close= weak

Too far= weak and weird welds

I just made a pack with this welder and have some observations.

My welds can be pretty inconsistent, when first switching the unit on it would not produce any current at the tips when I was pressing the button, then it would beep but not weld a couple of times and then all of a sudden BOOM massive weld and blow through but then it would be fine until the next switch off.  If I used the tips verticaly onto the strip I would get a bad weld even at 4ms, in the end I realised that angling the tips to 20 degrees off the nickle produced best results but occasionally I would get a bad weld even though I was trying to be consistent.

Unit heats up really quickly, I need a heat sink.  Its not consistent enough for me though, if I was selling batteries I could not use this unit

They are ok. Is the contact with the wire perfect? Good solders on the xt90? Try a little closer and try increasing pressure and inclination. 
Notice @taz is absolutely right but reducing pressure IS NOT a good idea. Increase pressure instead. Reducing pressure on both is most likely a hole. So make sure the strips are flat straightened and make a decent pressure. One of them will go harder but no hole.

Welds must have some inclination. 90° is not good. The temperature rises fast. Imho heatsinks and fans are a must if you plan to make big packs fast

Dirt tips will not weld

Bad pressure will not weld in bcs in wcs hole granted

Wrong degree inclination makes also perfect or poor welds

Industrial spot welding is actually very precise and uses pressure sensors for the perfect amount of pressure. I remember coming across force values depending on the different thicknesses of nickel or materials welded.

From what I understand using to much pressure can cause welds to fail prematurely.

car battery is possible yet most people failed. The machine has been designed to work with lipo.
Parallel is perfectly fine. Make sure you use very thick and short wires for the parallel connections. You will lose a lot of amps otherwise. Also test the flux times before you engage real cells. 4s has different flux times.

So at endless sphere, they're welding thicker copper, 0.1 to 0.15mm by simply placing a 0.15mm nickel strip on top of the copper strip, and spot welding both. The heat from the nickel welds the copper strip on to the battery. The nickel itself doesn't weld on the copper and you just remove it, and the copper strip supposedly remains, nice and welded. I don't have any copper strips, but can you try @rojitor?

People are all over their place in their results with copper as well as with the nickel sandwich.  In my experience w the boss and just copper the electrodes need to be placed just right and the pressure enough and the copper laid perfectly flat against the cell. This beyond having a reliably powerful battery.   Makes sense adding the nickel would make it easier with its added resistance.

well i guess those machines with very thick points that are unable to weld copper can improve the welds using the sandwich method.

So the reason I'd want copper over nickel is better conductivity, but 0.05mm copper is equal to 0.2mm nickel, which can comfortably carry 12A or so. But I'd want something like 0.15mm copper so I can carry over 30A. I was hoping the sandwich method could do 0.15mm copper, but I guess not.

To be honest i stopped using the button long time ago. I have set a reasonable auto-weld time and i find it more useful. Make sure the points are perfectly clean. Sometimes the weld does not happen if the points are darkened. Then check the solders of the button. You can make another with just dupont wires and a button.

Copy&paste from endless-sphere thread:

Today i made another sandwich method test with the custom boss spot welder. 
I am very happy with the results. Copper on copper sucks. I have never managed to make a decent weld. They do not stick. Using the sandwich method i made two strips of copper with nickel inside stick and two strips of nickel with copper inside stick too. 
Even though i prefer wide tabs this could be useful. Making it possible made my day.

left= double sandwich-------------------middle single sandwich----right=copper on copper

copper on copper=very weak welds. NOT viable

single sandwich= copper on copper with some nickel inside. Successful

[IMG]http://i66.tinypic.com/noy8o6.jpg[/IMG]

double sandwich=copper+nickel+copper+nickel. It failed yet seems two nickel strips with some copper inside is viable

These tests could be useful. The sandwich method can have some applications after all with this machine.

Using 0.15mm nickel and welding at 4ms. Welds look perfect. Should i use the same time for the next layer of nickel on top of nickle or increase to 5ms or 6ms?

Also, should i use the pen vertical or at an angle? Those welds are with the pen vertical.

@aulakiria @rojitor

I am trying to weld 0.1mm copper to 0.15 nickel, using a 4s lipo pack (4x2s 60c rating).

I’ve experienced a problem which led me to replacing the tips which did not help. The problem was there before and after changing probes.

Basically I can make a good weld, but only on one probe...

One side is fused and the other is weak and not fused. 

Any ideas?  Thanks

I thought it was my 3s graphene, but the problem followed to this new, strong 4s pack.

Are the fets of the Mini A boss  replacable? Or I just should buy another new one?

Yes they are. It's not easy though. Do you have soldering skills?

Yes, but maybe not enough :D funny story, my Mini spot welder came damaged, as in it had positive loose from the battery input, I soldered it 3 times, after each time it would work for some time and get loose again. Yesterday, after the third resoldering, I came back to doing my welds, did like 3 rows, went for one and boom, the spot welder legs got stuck to nickel really really hard, I imeadtly smelt the fets burning and saw "Fet eror" on the screen. To answer, I should be able to change the fets with eas, just don't feel comfortable in peeling the pcb from the case,

My spot welder is to weld nickel.
I did not try welding the copper.

The "FET error" message indicates the possibility of a broken FET.
FET needs to be replaced.
I encourage you to send it to me.

It’s what people want & shown to be possible, but I understand this is not how you see it being used. Apart from that please understand this uneven welding was also a problem for me welding nickel directly to the cells.

I am thinking after a few more tests to try a kweld comparison with the same battery, interested to see how they stack up

Thank you for your support

Hi,

For me it required replacing the LCD and the Arduino. Once replaced mine has been fine ever since.

Hope you can fix yours.

Please let us know how you go with the KWeld. 

I must admit that even though I use this for my purposes and it is functional, I still experience too much variability in welding outcomes. It's largely ok but not as good as I had expected. I thought it may have to do with my battery, and maybe it still does. I have not purchased a name brand LiPo but I am using a huge 8000 mAh, 80C+ rated battery.

Cheers.

In my case the boss welder exceeded my expectations. I do know sunkko. I used several of them so I know the boss is much much better. I wish I knew about the kweld, malectrics and kaeptnbalu to talk from real life experience in comparison. I used good lipo from day one so I never experienced difficulties some people reported. For me, just for me! Being small and portable is a must so I am very happy with my units.

How does a brass bus bar stack up against copper? I don’t see many battery builds wih brass, why is that?

Because cooper is better and easier to source (at least in my country)

Are there any issues spot welding nickel to copper? I was planning to use .4mmx12mm brass as a busbar but if it’s just as easy to spot weld copper, I might do that

Nickel on cooper is doable but requires high settings. I did many videos about it. Please check the endless-sphere thread.

Last I looked, not much point to it. Brass conduct slightly better than nickel, but parallel connections don't carry much current (unless you have very sparse series connections), and brass was kind of expensive.

More effective to solder to copper. Cheaper/simpler to use nickel.

My recollection is nickel spot welds to brass fine.

The plan is to use the brass busbar in a 10s4p 30q pack for series connections. The distance is short so I think it’ll be fine based on the info on Endless Sphere I referenced a year ago. Ollin Board also did their packs for cell level fusing with brass but not sure how many amps they were pulling across the series connections.

**Regarding your Video: MY Electrode Collection**
Roj, while I have watched most of your instructional videos, I find most of them are inconclusive and vague. 
1) When you say the commercially made Light Blue Electrode holder is  SH#&@T, you did not substantiate the reason as to why you proclaimed that the Light Blue Electrode Holder is Sh$%@T.
 You must remember that the video is viewed by thousands of public and they too may be puzzled at your comment. Please understand this.
2) Please give us a reason which prompted you to make such a comment. 
We need to know.
I am an owner of Mr.Lee’s Battery Operated spot welding device. The spot welder is functioning very well and I’m totally satisfied at this mini Marvel.
But the Holder is getting older. The electrodes are shakey and I need a decent well manufactured Electrode Holder and not those ugly items you exhibited.
3) Do you recommend a Sunkko product? Let’s know.
Thanks and regards.

That video is private. For forum members only. I explained at this very thread that the materials of that sunkko pen are extremely low quality. Sunkko sells another pen with good quality for pretty much the same price. I recommend the other one. Take a look at this thread.

by the way your comment is kind of rude. Reconsider your tone if you want an answer. 
Have a nice day.

Thank you Roj. I’d go for 70B Electrode holder.
I am appalled to observe that you found my comments, my statements to be repugnant and unsavory. My statements are true, even now, and I stand by it. There was not a speck of indignation, rage and I have received positive comments supporting my statement from other members of this forum.
FYI, it was you, who were “rude” when you described a Commercial Electrode Holder with a slander “$h1T” which you should not have done.
I’d still say, that your postings are inconclusive, vague and dangerous.
That said, I conclude my response.
Thank you and best regards
Respectfully,

Thank you for the images and spot weld results. The images look fantastic, exactly like a factory job. Great photography too. I'm buying SUNKKO 70B electrode holder.
The Plates looks like Cu. Is it really copper? I tried Cu strip before, but the result was negative. Could not spot. Perhaps I should recalibrate the settings to 5mS and 4X.
Thanks.
