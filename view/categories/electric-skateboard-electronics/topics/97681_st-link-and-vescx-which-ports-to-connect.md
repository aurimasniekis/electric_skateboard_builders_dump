Hi guys, so it doesn't look like I'm seeing any similar acronyms on the ST LINK and the VESC X. I found the tutorial that says to utilize the SWCLK, SWDIO, and RST ports on the ST LINK, but nothing about how the correspond the the VESCX, which has the following ports SCK/ADC1, TX/SDA/SS, RX/SCL/MOSI, and something/ADC2. which of these go together? I'm at a loss! They don't appear to go in the same order beacuse the GND port is in a different position on the ST link and VESCX. Thank you!! -Mike
