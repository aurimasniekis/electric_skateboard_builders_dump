Im 90% sure im not just imagining this... has anyone else experienced this and if so do you have a solution? 

This is my remote:

I have experienced similar when riding in midtown Manhattan... maybe too much 2.4Ghz interference...?

The solution is a diff remote. Lights from intersections interferes with these and Maytechs (if itâ€™s theres) hasnâ€™t come up with an solution.

yeah, actually i just finished my first build and been experiencing the same in manhattan... sketchy as fuck. I have a winning remote...oddly my meepo board has been pretty flawless while i owned it the last 9mo...  

but as soon as i get off the train at grand central and get into the city..i either get a temp drop out...or sketchy latency from remote to reciever.... crossing 6th and 30th stops the board too ... 

i dont want to spend more money but open to a gt2b if i can find an affordable one or an easy mod to make it not look so stupid

I think those maytech remotes are subject to interference. Some times relocation of the receiver may help. Sometimes thereâ€™s nothing you can do if the interference is too strong. Best to avoid the area. Dont want a run away board.

Do you have a recommendation of a dofferent/better remote? I cant really avoid the area as i live there 

I already tried moving the receiver away from the phase wires which helped a little but still didnt solve the issue 

The remote for my old boosted worked 100% fine in the same area so an interference-free ride is possible right?

I had this problem last week riding in a big city, two spots that I crossed always disconnect 

That is using NRF24L01, the standard version, almost run over two dudes since I couldnâ€™t brake, the behavior I programmed is to cease all connection until I reset the board to prevent it from jittering and throwing me off, bad idea

The worst remote ever (my personal opinion)
Is the former evolve. I had disconnections everytime a trucker was talking by radio.
The r2 is better tho. 
I usually have no problems with my other remotes. I have that maytech too. So far so good. I live in a small town, maybe that makes a difference.

@lennylogs lately there has been reports of interference all over the city, even from the metroboard guys and that remote is pretty solid. 

IMO  you have 2 choices 
A - products/torqueboards-2-4ghz-nano-remote-controller

B- or follow @caustin advise and get a GT2b mod. 
@FLATLINEcustoms can help you out on this one.

In Manhattan I've used mini 2.4ghz and gt2b mod. I've had dropouts with both but the mini recovers like 5x faster. Like .5sec vs 3sec.I have a pile of minis and swapping them out made the dropouts go away, I think it was repositioning of the receiver.

Anyway in my experience mini 2.4 is best, and you can mess around with positioning and antenna placement if you need a bit more.

I had the Maytech remote on my Raptor 1 but it made my girl kind of afraid to ride. On the first day using the remote it lost signal and she couldn't stop and hit the side of an SUV. She was all padded up and she was okay but it was a bit traumatizing for her. Ever since it's been hard to get her on a board.

yeah a remote with spotty connection is a terrifying thing - its not just about being able to foot brake effectively

if you don't immediately notice that its not responding once it regains connection it will suddenly shoot out from under you if you are accelerating or suddenly break really hard if you're braking. worst case scenario would be the launching of a 20+ pound board at the ankles of an unsuspecting pedestrian. i sometimes think it'd be safer if it just didnt reconnect at all

i also have been having one of two focbox do nothing after being pushed hard and then work later when it cools down 

im standing on the ends of my board all the time these days and so nerve racking.

From what I remember with master cho mod, gt2b has a bit more throw. The remote doesn't lay in the hand to give you easy access to all of the throw range. But maybe I'm just super used to the mini now.

@thisguyhere can you hook @Hummie up with a remote?

I've tried all the thumb remotes: nano, nanox, maytech. don't like thumb controls at all. 

gt2b  with mod is great, great control from long trigger throw, but hard to come by. 

the mini for me is the most solid, instant bind, never cuts out, good to excellent control with long trigger throw.

If your receiver has an antenna, try to move it away from the esc's and motors and not under your foot, I like mine in the middle of the board. I found this gave me better reception. You can wrap the receiver case in aluminum foil tape, this might help block some of the RF noise. Provided it has an external antenna or your just blocking the reception. 

The GT2B really is the most reliable connection in the esk8 world at the moment even though in the RC world it would considered a bear minimum of radio connection quality.

Some have mentioned 2.4GHz interference. It doesn't have to be JUST 2.4GHz signals. Sufficiently powerful RF signals at different frequencies can "swamp" the front-end of the 2.4GHz receiver. The receiver is simply more sensitive to 2.4GHz signals due to antenna, filters, signal processing, etc. In addition, harmonics from other signals also get through the 2.4GHz design elements as they are in the 2.4GHz band. The skateboard radios are operating in the thousandths of a watt power range, while emergency services and others are operating with signal outputs at multiple watts...that's many orders of magnitude higher power output.

I also might mention that newer Bluetooth specs provide for adaptive frequency use. The devices actually sample the RF environment and can set the device to avoid the frequencies that are cluttered by other users (wifi, etc) in real-time. It's possible that your specific remotes and receivers may not use Bluetooth with that capability. It wouldn't 100% eliminate the interference, but it could help substantially.

Reviving this thread. I decided to write Maytech to let them know about all the dropouts everyone was experiencing with their remotes when riding in RF noisy areas. I have two of their remotes and wasnâ€™t too happy about having spent decent money on them only to find theyâ€™re unrideable in the city. Below is the email conversation I had with them. Looks like theyâ€™ll be churning out a new version of their remote to correct the RF interference issue.

yeah so... for a couple weeks the gt2b was pretty solid..and then all of a sudden i starting getting this "breaking" signal riding thru time square... then down Park ave from GC to 27th... like bad... when i plugged back into vesc tool to see the live RF data the vescs were getting a break signal when the transmitter was off...and centered when on.... I assume i was getting some cut outs and thats what the brake signal was from. I reset the fail safe and it was all good again.... will find out next week again when I go back to work if its good again =/

i havent had one drop out with my @FLATLINEcustoms mad munkey gt2b since i installed it a little over a month ago 

among other places, the intersection at the end of my street in midtown would drop out for a few seconds literally 100% of the time with the maytech, and has not dropped out once with the gt2b 

in my opinion, its clearly superior. having said that, i try to avoid riding on the streets on manhattan so i have no idea if it always works everywhere in the city. except for at like 5am, the stress of riding in the streets here is not that fun - its more like trying to survive than enjoying a nice ride. especially when you're worried about your remote crapping out every time you approach an intersection. the safest/most enjoyable places to ride in nyc are off the streets where the connection works fine with most remotes anyways

Just want to put this somewhere, and this thread seems appropriate.  My Firefly remote is super dodgy for city riding.  There are numerous consistent drop out spots around the city, mostly at lights.  I am going to use something else.  Also, it feels like something someone made in a basement (probably because it was,lol).  No offense to anyone using/building/selling them, just my experience.  I have hopes for the Hoyt remote that I have on order, but if not that, I will be a benchwheel man.  Dammit if DIY needs a solid as fuck thumb remote. I have tried most.  I just want a smooth operating thumbwheel remote that doesn't want to kill my ass... Sorry for the rant, just frustrated that a $120 remote isn't the bees knees.  I should have known better.

I wonder what boosted does with their remote that makes it so reliable...people spend tons of money on their diy esk8s and there are so many smart people making cool things for this community, im sure that if one of those people were to make a solid remote plenty of people on the forum would pay a lot of money for it

you must use some metal to shield the nano both ends. copper tape will be a good place to start, see if that fixes your issues.

Believe the Boosted remotes are Bluetooth.

Nope, it's 2.4ghz RF.

Then Iâ€™m confused by the Boosted support website and their reference to a Bluetooth radio...

Are we talking about a boosted or benchwheel remote?

Problem still fucking persist with me and the gt2b... Every day right at the top of grand central/park and 41st going south and a full block on 28th and 6th north or eats... Even tried re-pairing the remote but may tinker it again this week and see.... A few other spots here and there....

Have you tried repositioning the antenna, or with relation to other wires? Maybe feed the antenna to the topside somehow?

If anyone is having good fortune with receivers in busy city areas with interference such as NYC, could you post pictures of how you have the receiver in your enclosure along with any antenna/shielding?

Move the receiver away from phase wires and power leads.  At least 4 inches and you should be good.  I usually mount the RX on the side of the battery about 6 inches away from the ESC's.

for me ive tried a variety of positions with the receiver closer to the battery..one side of the case vs the other... with the receiver antenna inside the case... drilled a tiny hole and fed it outside the case and taped it to the side... nothing as solid as it once was when i first plugged it in...  =/

Hm. One thing I noticed, the minis might wear out. An older one I had started to have glitches. It had been through a lot though... Swapped it out for another one and zero dropouts. Might be worth trying. They're as cheap as $17 if you catch it.

So I have been testing out the Benchwheel remote all over the city this afternoon.  NO DROPOUTS!  

I went to all the spots I could think of that I have had previous dropouts with other remotes, and it was solid all the time. Hell, I was trying to make it drop. 

@mmaner is right, this thing is solid.  At least in my city.  No clue for you NYC boys,  ut maybe something to try if you want a solid connection simple thumb remote.

I still can't wait to try out the Hoyt remote!

This is really small...
 But it doesn't come with a lanyard or a place to attach one.  Dumb easy fix.  Drill small hole and lanyard. I am just so used to being able to drop my remote and have a lanyard, I had to add one.

But that is literally nothing to fix...

The case is kind if small but the thumb trigger has more travel than any other thumb remote so it's all good.

Also, the case is bugger than the nano-x, which is too small for my hand.

I always felt sorry for people having problems with dropouts but I never had such.

Well on my second board I have the deadly Maytech 1712 remote which has ridiculously often dropouts and large areas where I have to hold the remote between knee and ankle to keep it connected, looks like a monkey.

My steez remote has no interference problems at all.

I think I have to change the remote because I love life not death. Shame on maytech!

im starting to wonder if its my transmitter thats the actual issue =/ yesterday at home I literally got done reorganizing my case and electronics... re ran motor detection...re did ppm and went for a long ride... maybe 2/3rds of the ride done i made a stop and my motors were getting a "go" signal while the trigger was at zero... (this isnt a trim issue) ...braking made it stop and after a few trigger pulls things settled... so i get home... re config ppm setting just in case...test it out and make sure all is good.

this AM as i leave for work i turn the board on.. then the tx and the wheels start running like wtf..  i reconfig ppm real quick just in case...all looks good and head out the door... right off the bat supper choppy throttle all the way to train station... fml

will have to limp cautiously to work, but when this mini remote arrives I may just try binding it to the gt2b receiver first to see what happens, if anything

Check ppm cable and/or splitter too. The mini remote has cheap pots and switches, I don't expect them to last forever. Would be nice to swap out the pot for hall sensor but that's a bit too much for me.

cheap pots

thats a thought, although not sure how i would test to verify if the one in my gt2b is faulty... or replaceable... mini arrives today..woo hoo... so tomorrow is a new day to cross all my fucking favorite manhattan dead zones

Oh gt2b? Just to reiterate, I found that in manhattan gt2b and mini drop out in the same places, but mini reconnects in a fraction of a second while gt2b takes like 1-2 seconds. This makes all the difference.

I used to have a brief dropout occasionally at like 32nd and 7th, and maybe 40th and 8th, but not recently.

yeah in the beginning all was good... 

then 28th and 6th... 

then one day I had to roll thru time square from GC and got cut outs crossing 6th and 7th west on 42nd...   

now its like always on 41st and park (southbound)... kinda spotty down park till about 32nd...  oddly when I head north on park same route no issue =P

Unfortunately, my experience has been different... not sure if mine was defective or not, but I was getting random delays. I really do love the remote itself, though.

Well day 1 with the mini is good and 2/2 on my problem areas...no issue today heading down park...and I crossed 28th and 6th on purpose to see and.no issue... More testing needed =P I do miss the trigger throw of the gt2b and my thumb really wants to hold the mini remote where trim knobs are so may have to glue them in place and cover with tape so I dont accidentally move anything

FYI I couldn't solve the constant drop outs of the Maytech MTSKR1712 in the city that's why I switched to steez (Maytech MTSKR1512) remote and had not a single drop out in the same areas.

Unfortunately the steez is expensive but very reliable on my 2 builds. The only dangerous thing is that when you push down the thumb throttle (cruise control) at 0% throttle the remote enters pairing mode and you loose any control until you push it again.
