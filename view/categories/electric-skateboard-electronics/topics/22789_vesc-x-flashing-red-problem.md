My vesc X is flashing red light three times continually
Red red red, red red red, red red red
And repeats forever
Does anyone know how to fix this? The motor shows no reaction when I pull <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/c/4c1e5b5aace47db6ae6cbbcd0d29b78d0e811d23.jpg" width="690" height="390">e trigger.

Sorry Man I've seen only less than a hand full  of fry DRV on a VESC-X, It's probably something else mosfet or bad parameter. 

@Hoho0220  Can you post your BLDC TOOL setting and as @Blasto suggest some picture of your setup will be more than welcome.
