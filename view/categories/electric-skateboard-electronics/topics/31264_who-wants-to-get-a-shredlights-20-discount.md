hi,

yesterday i asked to shredlights facebook page if it's possible to organize a group buy, this was their reply

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/5/85fa8e3aabcb503c655db4588739262da9306ab6.png" width="282" height="286">

they said if we are 10 people minimum we can get a discount code. i don't know if is the same coupon as @Michaelinvegas published a few months ago "GIVEMELIGHT" (that still works)

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/6/16f905554cfe6a4bd1e1bd6b87de2fb63d8afe17.jpg" width="506" height="424">

maybe if we are more than 10 people we can get a better discount...

i've a list of 5 people right now, anyone wants to join us? leave a comment :)

thanks

Oh, and yeah, the GIVEMELIGHT coupon still works.

reply by shredlights, copy & paste

"There is a maximum of 20 people for the group discount. Between 10-20 people, we can offer you guys 20% discount 🙂 Please note that we will issue you a discount code for everyone to use and all the orders will still be shipped separately. We cannot guarantee that there will not be a custom fee when shipping USPS, so we recommend using DHL express for shipping."

we almost reached our goal of 20 people, i've a list from people outside this forum with 6 people already.

if do you have any questions, i can ask them to Andrew, BTW some friend knows some guy called Joe from shredlights, i'm waiting for his response.

i will keep you updated.

thanks

[/quote]

Actually, for EU, there is less chance that item will be taxed when using USPS than DHL. Also, DHL customs service expenses are much higher (not tax itself but the service fee). 
The "problem" is the declared value that they (ShredLights) put on the package. They put the full price so it will be looked by customs in any way (USPS or DHL). I recently got mine and payed customs (which I expected but still hoped not to) :)

@SilentException  they told me this at the beginning
"We could however send a discount code for a group to use individually when they each buy"

so i understand that they send the orders individually...

i asked a friend from Barcelona - Spain who bought the front lights because shredlights are out of stock of taillights and he said me that didn't pay any customs, but I can not guarantee that this will be for everyone, this is what he paid in total.

he selected the first class mail (the latest screenshot is from a purchase test)

Isn't the tax limit for packages in Spain 45€ as well? Might be the reason :) Also, first class mail intl. is USPS.

I'm not sure about the customs in Spain, with DHL i always paid customs...

Yes, I got full set, with some extra bracket/nuts. If I could go back in time I would get one more set of standard brackets to put on my second board. Lights are easy to remove and attach once the brackets are on.

Customs as usual, PayPal invoice * 0.22 + 5-10€ service fees. Shipped with USPS and arrived very quickly.

Also, check these guys out: https://www.slickrevolution.co.uk/product/shred-lights/
UK based, most likely higher price than US with discount but when you count the customs and shipping from US..do the math and decide what works better for you :)

Been waiting for tail lights to come back in stock.  Looks like they are.  Any idea if they are a red light or regular colored for the headlight?  They look like the headlights with the black housing vs the red.

Anyone on the fence about buying these I've been really happy with my headlight set.  So much so I'm wanting to get a tail light now.  Great fit and so far have held up to the abuse my personal setups haven't held up to.

@Tomer sucks that politics would prevent money and goods for being exchanged, lost on both sides. This is why I love hobbies like esk8. The racism and hatred goes away as we all love and enjoy the same thing...fight and join together for the same goals

Thanks man. I can reach the site, proxy is not needed. Issue is that Israel won't show up in the countries list.

this is the situation:

2- for european people: a friend is talking with someone from shredlights too, trying to get a discount code from a UK distributor to avoid customs but the contact is now in holidays.

for americans there is no problem, europeans do you prefer to use the coupon and maybe pay customs or wait until we can contact this UK distributor? please leave a comment.

thanks

i got a response from Andrew, i will send the coupon code via private message.

"Just created the 20% discount code for tomorrow (August 30th).
Once again, it's good for one use per customer and will only allow 20 people to use it, only on August 30th from 12am- 11:59 pm. Glad we could get something worked out for you! Looking forward to it."

please if you use the coupon leave a comment in this thread and very important don't share it with other people because is limited for 20.

i think shredlights timezone is PST
