hey guys, I am curious about settings to minimize motor heat

I have 10s4p, dual 6374, 15T/40T 105 mm wheels. 

I am wondering if Foc Sensored generate more heat at speed? there is also less torque when using FOC. just curious about everyone's experiences and settings. 

thanks!

FOC runs the motor more efficiently and quieter at a cost of higher switching losses. IIRC, FOC ends up being slightly more efficient overall. Torque is less, but you probably won't really notice.
