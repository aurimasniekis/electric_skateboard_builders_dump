I found these 2 just by looking thru their site since im planning to order some bmss soon, I chose these two because they have an e switch, did anyone use these and bypassed them?
I'm interested if their e switch would fail from bigger batteries like ours, as the 80A model is just too big for my liking. 
Im looking for a on off solution for my future build that is not a antispark switch.
Did anyone use this model?

If your going to use them for charge only the e-switch will not work for you.  it cuts power to the battery via the negative link out which won't be there in charge only.

like @mmaner pointed out, if you bypass them - well you bypass the switch too and you won´t have the board off.

It´s always good to think about other oportunities, maybe we´ll find a use in it somehow :slight_smile:

What i like and would like to try is this:

A simple balancerboard, where you should be able to charge your battery without a bms if you monitor it right.
@PXSS your thoughts on this?
