_Before reading:_
**Please do not feel that you are interrupting the flow of ideas or anyone else who is reading this thread and has an idea. Though few people are discussing the remote, being developed on this thread, I have continued to reply publicly so that this controller can be made as good as it possibly can be - I am sure that other people will input valuable ideas based on their experiences and will value seeing the thought process behind decisions. Please reply with ideas of things you would like added to the code and changes to the design to make it look less bulky!**

Hello! I have created the WINNING Remote shell from scratch with OLED place in Fusion 360.
In the OLED Remote.zip you have two options, A tight fit one, or a more loose one for the OLED.
When you install the OLED **do not push it hard** otherwise it will break like my 6 other oleds...

If you 3D print it post it below  :slight_smile:
Because I cant 3D print it right, I broke a part for the stepper motor. 

_You are allowed to modify and sell it but you need to give me credits for 3D Modeling it and if selling ask the WINNING Company for permission._

I will create a PCB that are Arduino compatible and compatible to this shell. I am waiting for my custom pcb that runs on ATmega32U4. If I succeed I will move forward and create one for this shell.

My PCB looks like this:

[/quote]

Its a copy ready for 3d printing.
I did this because I really like how it looks and how small it is. 
Inside it I have my own electronics not the unreliable winnings remote.

Technically it's a better version because its reliable and has a display that shows the current ampere, voltage, speed with a menu that you can change the light colors, speed, acceleration, where to turn when you have enabled the GPS Destination etc.

I do not know what part they use but found a simple pot on ebay (http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/2-PCS-Piher-Potentiometer-PT15-Rotor-16mm-WHITE-RED-/220651549590?hash=item335fdb7396). If a thumbwheel was then 3D printed (with two holes near the edge 180o apart from each other), then put a spring between casing and holes on thumbwheel for both sides of the thumbwheel and two part epoxy the thumbwheel to the rotating part on the potentiometer. Then you have a thumbwheel!

I assume you are using RollingGecko's code from Github? If not, what does yours do differently?

I do not use RollingGecko. I made my own hardware. The difference is I can change values with my controller. Like turning on/off lights, change the light color, the max speed, max ampere and acceleration.

Will you open source your software at the end so others can use - it looks amazing? I am thinking of doing this next year but maybe also integrating some gps navigation using Google maps API, bluetooth to transfer data and gps to know when the next direction should be displayed. Having something like this: https://snazzymaps.com/style/79/black-and-white on an lcd display would also be quite cool.

The problem I have with that thumbwheel is that it looks like it returns to very back when released - I would prefer if it went to the middle or to 1/3 from back (if you see what I mean).

Yes I have thought about that. Before I had bluetooth connected and I could change values and controll the speed with my iphone. I think about having an ESP8266 that host an access point to show where you have driven and the good thing with having an ESP8266 I can have wireless updating. I will have a gps module that gets logged on a sd card. The ESP reads from the sd card and writes it to the client. The gps gives me the local time too so I will  have a bar in the middle of the oled in the controller displaying the current time.

But I think having two system that uses wire to communcate, because I dont want the reciever to UART to get slowed down etc.

Ohh I forgot that, I get what you are saying ;)Â¨

Well the bad thing about having that map on the oled is that I need to be connected to the internet. But its doable I think. But it will be hard to see on the oled. I will give it a try in the future?

Its an easy fix to get it go back in the middle, I will 3D design it now.

Seems like you have an idea how to do it! I am going to have to research how the ESP8266 works and how to get the app to copy some text from a webpage to understand your code I think! Please post pictures if you get this working. I will upload in 30 minutes a stl of the thumbwheel I was talking about to thingiverse and will post link here.

Cool! If you want ESP8266 to get things from webpage you can use an API called ThingSpeak and use HTML XPATH. On the ESP you use HTTP Request.

Thanks for the explanation, my main idea is the gps directions not the map (map was just cool addition but really useless because so small)! I don't have the time to work on this until June but I assume it is going to involve setting up a website, inputting start point and destination, then fetching the directions from Google and weeding out all the unnecessary stuff. Then this script has to be transferred over ESP8266 wifi to the arduino(s) that have bitmaps for the Turn left, turn right instructions and a gps. The screen will then display metres to where you need to turn, which way you need to turn, then a line, then speed in top right, then km/miles left (based on gps and watt hours). This code is beyond me for the moment, so good luck if you are going to try it - you seem to know a lot more! By the way, I couldn't find the use of Thingspeak in this application (perhaps it is my insufficient knowledge of coding) I did understand Xpath though!

And for the gps you can also use an accelerometer inside the board that shows the way. The arrow will move dynamic of the way the board is pointed.

If I understand your reply as something like this (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1411369083/beeline-smart-navigation-for-bicycles-made-simple), I think that a gps with turn signals would better. A dynamic rotating arrow based on the direction of the board that showed you which exit on every turn to take would be cool, but hard to implement with the Google API. It also would be harder to interpret on some roundabouts where the exits are close together. To make connections clear, I have started a list below (connections I am unsure about in italics)

Nano connections possible: SPI, Serial, I2C and 

Receiver on board: Tx, Rx, 5v 0V connected to VESC, SPI connections to nRF24L01+,
Transmitter arduino nano 1: _Serial connection to other nano_, SPI connections to nRF24L01+, I2C screen
Transmitter arduino nano 2: _Serial connection to other nano , GPS connection, ESP8266 wifi connection to phone (app/ webpage will produce some data that needs to be transferred across using wifi), sd card connections_

I use solidworks but am trying out Fusion 360 because it renders fast and beautiful! :) I think the thumbstick should have a knob to indicate where it is - the bobbles will give grip but won't allow you to know where it is (if you see what I mean). It certainly looks more professional than mine, but don't know where the spring connections go - is it a 'copy' of the linked one or an improved version that returns to half-way/ 1/3 of the way up.

Didn't mean for this to be so long!

Almost, but I will use one in the middle.
The spring is in the middle of the static overhang, with the two cylinders(More like a metal thread, then a spring).

And the gps bike thing is just like what I meant! I didnt fully understand what you meant with the connections, on second thought I think what you mean. 

For the GPS, we could have a setting with "Auto Turn Signal". So when you are 5 meters before a turn to the right it will blink for you automatic.

Got it now for the thumbstick! Do you agree about the arrow or would you prefer it - I suppose if you know which way you should head that is much simpler, uses up less memory and has less to go wrong! Also, everyone should be able to follow an arrow and easier to learn about a place if you do not blindly follow instructions but work it out! I was just thinking that bluetooth is compatible with everything, so connect bluetooth module to serial of transmitter nano 2 and then send a string (latitude and longitude) to the bluetooth module of transmitter nano 2. Problem is that currently the serial port of the transmitter arduino nano 2 is connected to the other transmitter nano!

I have a much better idea with the tracking system.
In Xcode I can make an map application, that connects via bluetooth. So you know the apple map that shows arrow and when to turn left. I have the same thing and send that data to the bluetooth and visualize it with the oled. Much easier and faster. But I have no idea of making that into an android application.

Please change dimensions/ everything you want/ start afresh but I will have little time to do any more design/ coding work during the week. My controller design seems very clunky so I will have to find ways to make it look cooler - maybe add some useless fins and some bevels in places. Handles will also need finger dents in them. I just understood the timeline feature towards the end of editing - I could not find the usual 'edit feature' button from solidworks so there are some additional extrusions!

I got a VERY good idea!
You know you need to use 4G to use the map to get location. If I use the GPS Module and send current location to my phone via bluetooth you won't need to use 4G nor Internet. And selecting places does not need 4G either, only searching. But to load the map you need 4g...
```

You don't need 4g to get location (your phone has a gps chip inside) - on some gps apps you can download the map so it is offline then you don't have to pay data charges (but you don't know traffic like with waze). A user should only need to put in his destination at the start of a ride and should have wifi then - starbucks/ home wifi/ work wifi. If not, one internet search uses hardly any data, but good idea. Actually, the user could be given the choice to get the longitude and latitude from one of the apps where you can download the map offline. Then copy and paste that into a super simple, 'upload this string to the arduino nano controller' app.

Okey progress is being made! I have now created an application with the MapKit in Xcode, now it tells me currently the steps. I will try to figure out with the turn to left in 50 meters soon. Right now its like this:

> Proceed to Arne Garborgs veg
> Use the roundabout to make a U-turn
> At the roundabout, take the second exit onto Jernbanegata
> At the roundabout, take the first exit onto Meierigata
> Arrive at the destination

I got an idea how to make it say turn left in 50 meters.
If I take the distance and check if text contains left, then I can format it in to "Turn Left in 50m"

for step:MKRouteStep in steps{
print("Distance: \(step.distance)")
print("Instruction: \(step.instructions)")
}

This is how it looks like(I can change road types, like bike path, walking etc, so it chooses your preference):
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/1/91c9dad8416c9a3593abf5f9cd75a6f8c4fc7d40.png" width="284" height="500">

This is good I tested it on another road with no roundabout, only straight roads.
> *Distance(In): 0.0m 
> *Instruction: Proceed to Keep
> *Distance(In): 405.0m 
> *Instruction: Turn right onto IngThis
> *Distance(In): 123.0m 
> *Instruction: Turn left onto Secret
> *Distance(In): 90.0m 
> *Instruction: Turn right onto ForMyOwn
> *Distance(In): 52.0m 
> *Instruction: Turn left onto Privacy
> *Distance(In): 5.0m 
> *Instruction: Arrive at the destination

I can format it if I get a "Turn left onto Anon". And let it show a left arrow with the meter below of it.

And the good thing with it going thru all the steps. I can upload the destination to the sd card, it will give name on the cordinates etc. But if you take a wrong way it will not tell you tho..

```
a) it looks amazing
b) The problem of 'if user goes off-route' is one I have been thinking about'. 
      i)If the location of each junction is given, could there be a small rotating arrow in the top of the screen that points to the next junction (based on the way the accelerometer is pointed) - that way if you go off track you can just follow that arrow to rejoin your route. 
      ii)GPS Navigation by Scout was the offline navigation app I was thinking of, but their api seems to be getting updated and by the sounds of it, you have to pay so rerouting offline is not possible unless you can do it offline with google/ apple maps api. My idea with the offline reroute is that when a reroute is sensed (I assume that if in offline mode you could get the app to calculate a reroute every 30 seconds) the phone sends a bluetooth packet so the controller shows 'Reroute being calculated' and then sending the new route. 
     iii) Find all the junctions around the route at the start and say u-turn when the user gets there.

Option i) seems easiest then iii) then ii). What do you think?

It is not that bad using 4G for it, hmm speed limits dont think so. Well the eyes should be on the road so you should see a sign but it would be cool to have the speed limit. 

I am soon finished with the software. Right now the GPS sends the Latitude and Longitude via bluetooth to my phone. On my phone it chooses that as a source location(Like current position). The map updates dynamic, you choose a location to go to, it auto routes for you on the iphone. I have managed to send data back with the bluetooth with a string that contains: "AR,11.0" that gets encoded to "Turn right in 11 meters." Or just a symbol with the meters below it. But the update rate is 1-2 seconds.
```

Great! The speed limit was a joke - my board I am planning shouldn't be able to get to more than 21mph (first board so playing it safe) but will be a 7s6p - 340Wh of power! The encoding looks simple but understandable. I think the update rate (assumed from phone to remote) is good - electric skateboarding is not rally driving so the instructions don't have to be given super fast, but too slow and you could be convinced you are going the right way when you aren't and forget to check the screen again.
```

## \#40 Posted by: Sander Posted at: 2017-05-01T07:43:51.128Z Reads: 361

I thought about that too. The updating rate isnt bad and when you shall turn you always slow down, or mostly because of the road rules. And it updates 1 - 1.5 seconds. It's an easy fix. All I need to do is changing the baudrate for the bluetooth. Right now its on 9600 and creates a delay when you send a long float value to it, like the cordinates that contains over 7 numbers 00.000000. But it works!

The arrow to pointing to correct place should be useful, because sometimes the gps jumps a few meters and then it will show you the wrong turn, but if you use the compass you can sync it with the phone, and get the right directions.

My first board was also 21mph plenty of speed there!

I am wondering if the phone gps should be used (rather than a separate one in the remote) as the one in the phone is probably more accurate. Don't know if there is enough data for current longitude and latitude to also be sent - as you said, each one contains over 7 numbers!

The sending is not a problem. But I think I will leave two options. 
1. Using Phone = 4G, RIP Battery
2. Using GPS in board with downloaded map on phone with no internet/4g = Healthy battery.

I can make it in two options though. But I will choose the second one for now. I can even connect a GSM module to the board so if it gets stolen you can track it everywhere in the world.

Nearly finished replicating exactly a 2.4ghz antenna - I think the back of my first design looked to big and clunky, so seeing if maybe I can get the antenna to come up the middle of the back of the screen and have the back of the screen look like it is molded around the antenna. Also redoing the remote at the same time - started the grip, have made indents for fingers and a hole for the thumb stick (unsure of its dimension though). I like the idea of the phone doing the brunt of the work - my board will have a 5000mah fast-charge battery pack on it so I can charge my remote and maybe my phone as well when not riding!

Round holes at the front are for leds/ arrays of leds. Switches can be put on the sides or below the screen. The thumbstick goes in the slot on the handle. The grip has got finger dents in them, I put the antenna where it is, so that the signal from the transmitter only has to go through plastic not the palm/ fingers of a hand which will weaken it.

I know there are SMD antennas, but I do not want a signal drop - hence the massive antenna rated for 1000m. On an e-board, I rate safety highly - no signal drops is the aim. I was hoping it would appear more like a face but now you raise the middle finger image ... it does look like a middle finger (will have to change that). Any suggestions on changing the shape of the controller is appreciated.

Maybe change the placement for the antenna? Because it points up to the air not down to the board. Or flat.. If you make it coming out of the cylinder.

This is the long range module in smd! You can see it has an inbuilt antenna. It is listed on the same specs. So you should get 100 meter with no problem.
[NRF24L01 Long Range SMD](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-SMD-NRF24L01-1100-meter-long-distance-NRF24L01-PA-LNA-SMD-wireless-modules-1100meters-in/2022127731.html?spm=2114.40010508.4.27.OGF00a)

And the good thing I dont need to change the pcb because it has the same pins!

Im going to add a option in my app now. 
The option is Phone Location, or Board Location.
I think if I download the map and uses the phone location I dont need to use internet.

I think that I will purchase 2 boards in september first with the smd antenna, test that to make sure it is safe and then purchase the larger antennas if ever the signal cuts out in testing. I am slightly dubious as to whether the smd antenna will allow for the same distance as the usual wifi antenna style (optimistic distance rating on the smd?), but if it is good enough following testing, I will go with that - gives more space for electronics and doesn't look like a middle finger!

Post pictures of your app/ pcb when you have made those changes - sounds great. I thought you said above that you were going to get rid of the gps in the transmitter? Or are you going to leave it in, but only use it if is triggered in the app?

You can choose to use the gps in board or the gps on your phone on the settings in the app. 
And I think the smd nrf24l01 long range is that good! Because it has Low Noise Amplifier and Power Amplifier. And if I use a UF capacitor to get rid of the noises in the power from the battery the range increases too!

You know the ESP8266 they have a ridiculous long range! They have only a pcb antenna. But the NRF Longrange smd has an external antenna cap, that improves. So it should work perfect! I will do some range testing with them in the future ;)

Yes I will show you images etc. Right know I need to add function like: You are not connected to bluetooth. Because sometimes I am wondering why I cant find the bluetooth device because I had my bluetooth turned off.

**GPS Style:**

_Board:_
It uses a GPS that are connected to a processor in the electric skateboard, that sends the longitude and latitude via bluetooth to your phone. When the phone receive it, it calculates it and chooses the fastest route. Then the phone sends back the direction to the processor. The processor then sends it via a radio to the display on the remote. The remote shows where to turn, and when to turn in meters. 
Phone uses almost no power.

_Phone:_
It uses the Phones gps. Uses alot of power. It gets the latitude and longitude from the gps in the phone. And then it calculates the route to destination, sends back road direction via bluetooth. The processor forwards that data to the remote and display where to turn, and when to turn in meters.

_Follow Current Position:_
It follows your current position :)

-----

It displays the route on the phone(Not shown in picture because it shows my location). I will add more settings like accuracy of gps on phone, auto blinker, road type(Highway, Normal, bikepath, wallking path) and much more. Since the gps can calculate the time I can add various features like auto night light. You go on the phone/remote and choose the time when you want the lights to turn on. Like if the clock is 18:00 the light will turn on automatic, add a light sensor on it to so when you enter a tunnel with no light inside it the light on the board goes on.

_Bugs to be fixed:_
Timeout on making/refreshing routes.

Error: Error Domain=MKErrorDomain Code=3 "Directions Not Available" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Directions Not Available, MKErrorGEOError=-3, MKErrorGEOErrorUserInfo={
    GEORequestThrottleStateLevel = 0;
    GEORequestThrottleStateResetTimeRemaining = "0.5064319968223572";
}, MKDirectionsErrorCode=0, NSLocalizedFailureReason=A route could not be determined between these locations.}

To fix this I think I wlll need a delay, I hope I am right.

Looks like the Apple's API is shit! You cant send to many request and if you do it times you out for 6 second. So I will create the app again from the bottom, but this time I will use Google's API. I hear it doesn't time out like apple's api, which is good. So I hope this will work!

Is the first processor you are talking about in the board - nano in board is connected to vesc, bluetooth, GPS module and NRF. Seems like a lot for the bottom board to handle, given that you want it to send the data up from the VESC up without errors and send back throttle/ braking power without errors. But I may have misunderstood.

YES! The Google API works! I haven't made the direction yet, but since I am using google's map you can download the MAP! To download the map you download the Google Map app and go to setting and download area nearby, when it is downloaded you can use it in my app so now you don't need internet to use the navigation which is awesome! or it should atleast because on you could do that on the Pokemon Go app. But on offline only the road route works, not the bike, walk routes.

Actually google gives you 150,000 request per day! if you contact them ;)
But the bad thing is I can only get direction by connecting to wifi. So the offline will not be available for now.

I can request as fast as I want with Google API which is amazing! If I create the arrow pointing the right direction everything gets more easier, because then I only need to request once. You see you are driving the wrong way when the meters goes up and the arrow is pointing behind you. 

I will try to make it saves it.
Well this is the data I get when I request:

Great that so many requests can be made! Wifi thing doesn't matter for the moment - first let's get proof of concept working, then improve and add extra functionality.

I agree with your point about the arrow, unless the road is winding and cuts back on itself - it will initially look like you are going the wrong way then you find out you aren't after checking your phone. Thought about having the arrow pointing at the current instruction's endpoint, but that will look choppy and will have the same problem if the road is winding. I suppose the rider knows that he/she should go straight on, unless told otherwise (in the outputted JSON there are maneuvers   ... "maneuver" : "turn-left",  ... so these could be displayed on the screen as temporary icons (like indicator lights) with metres to that maneuver on the bottom of the display) - see image. 

A more info button (for analysing stats when stopped) would also be nice - click the button and it goes to a list view of meters travelled, max speed, average speed, watt-hours/mile, watt hours used, estimated charge time (based on charge current and watt-hours used), battery voltage etc. For the more info, the fewest number of buttons I can think of is 3 --> one where if you click it, you go into more info (list) screen, click it again and you go back to the riding screen, another to scroll down and another to scroll up. 

I have put up a mock riding screen below (max 1 turn left/ right light will be displayed, but both are shown for placement) please give me your suggestions for how to change it. The green line is the edge of the screen (not to scale just roughly by eye guesstimated) and the italics are my thoughts for units decisions.

Finally! It took ages to get the first maneuver! Now I get maneuver 1 by maneFirst[1],  maneuver 2 by maneFirst[2] etc. So now it is working now I need to test if it really works going for a walk brb ;)

Back from the walk:
Everything worked perfect! It told me to turn-left or turn-right which were right! Tomorrow I will add the distance. But if you are going the wrong way it doesn't tell you. If you were on the right track from the beginning I think it should not be a problem as long as it reroute you but when its only 1 road and you pass the only left it will keep telling you to go left.. So I need to make a counter of when the meters get  higher and higher when it has counter to 10 it will tell you, you are going wrong way, please turn around.

**Update:**
The gps connected to Arduino sends the coordinates via bluetooth.
when the phone gets the coordinates it creates a path and sends back where to turn and meters to that turn.

The App works now in locked screen! So your phone don't need to be unlocked inside the app.

So it is working!

It operates on 2.5 voltage, thats the lowest for the ATmega32U4.

And the bug is when I send and recieve at the same time I get those weird values but that could be the ESP. 
I will not use the ESP, I am using it right now because I have no Arduino around. 

So when I get the UNO I will change the baudrate of the bluetooth from 9600 to 115200 so everything get processed faster which means faster refresh rate :) . The tracking is done! In the settings you can choose board gps, or the phones gps. And it seems like the board gps is more accurate it doesnt jump around like the phone does. The gps costed 24$ tho.

It does not send a request to google when the bluetooth is not connected.
When you are connected it sends request every second. 

On my ESP I receive the distance and which way to turn.

Here are some values recieved from the ESP from the phone.

If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may become unstable."). Surprising that the gps on the board jumps around more than the phone!

Great! I don't know if it would be possible for the average speed to be shown in settings - then input that speed in the app so ETA is more accurate. Maybe also add in the app, before trip is confirmed a screen that says you: will have ___miles left after this/ run out of battery with ___miles to go.

Thats pretty easy to do but first you need to know how much your battery is charged. But if you wanna know how much is charged you either have a bms that can tell you or I need to have a current reader when charging reading how much has been charged when battery is empty.

Well, my idea was based on the VESC outputting over uart (among other things) the total battery voltage and Watt-hours used. So, the user inputs the watt-hours of his battery and max voltage in app settings, then watt-hours left can be calculated from starting watt hours (look at voltage to estimate starting watt-hours in battery), then subtract the watt-hours used (from VESC). The Wh/mile can be calculated every 1/10 mile by putting the value of watt-hours at the start in a variable and putting the value of watt-hours at the end of the 1/10 mile in a variable and finding the difference. Then *10 to get a number and add the string "Wh/mile".

Yes but the voltage jumps from 44.4 to 44.2 to 44.4 to 44.2 etc. So it would be better if I created a current reader on my pcb. So when you charge the board the VESC turns on gives power to the pcb and it reads. With the VESC I can see how much has been drawn so if I have a value like: unsigned long charged = 0;
So when the current reader reads current you calculate it and make it into mAh. So for my board it will be 12000mah. 

With the VESC I can use the Amp/watt hour to remove the mah. And when regenative braking it tells you "You have regenerated 15 mah" in the Stats sections.

Here is a current sensor supporting 50A, 100A, 150A and 200A.
But I dont know what is the max voltage or does it have it?
http://www.ebay.com/itm/50A-100A-150A-200A-Bi-Uni-AC-DC-Current-Sensor-Module-arduino-compatible-/111689533182

Here is an example to measure the charged mah's.

> float watts = amps * batteryVoltage;

> sample = sample + 1;

> msec = millis();

> time = (float) msec / 1000.0;

> totalCharge = totalCharge + amps;

> averageAmps = totalCharge / sample;

> ampSeconds = averageAmps*time;

> ampHours = ampSeconds/3600;

> wattHours = batteryVoltage * ampHours;

Since I have no boards to use the oled on. I will create a "arduino simulator" in processing for the OLED. When the ESP get value from the bluetooth it send the value with Serial to the Processing.

My board will be a 8s that is split into two 4s (same mah) with the on/off switch. Now the two batteries are split up, I can charge both the cells in parallel. The problem with this and your planned setup is that the vesc cannot be on whilst charging (not a complete circuit for battery input). However if you use a lipo/liion charger you can see the amount of charge put in the batteries (mah). So, if the user inputs these charge mah values into the app before riding, it will work the same, just without so much maths and finding a chip with the right specs!

You are wondering why does it randomly changes directions? Its because I am standing near a cross point. Its a turn to right at the end of the road. PS I am moving around.

liion so 28.8V nominal voltage, 33.6V fully charged (will only charge to 32V to extend battery life), 20V fully discharged but would only discharge it to 26/25V (to extend life of batteries). Under my board I will also have a 5000mah 5V battery pack to charge things like my phone when not riding and power the processor whilst riding. Your directions look good but don't know why the distance was increasing as you approached the crossing! The signs look clear though and the distance doesn't update so often that it is distracting. I don't what the AR and AL things were (0:03 and 0:16) on the simulated OLED - think it was that there were 0m left to that direction?

You can see the picture above. It creates the shortest route for you. When I am standing on the red dot it switches. The one route is 15m to the right the other is a long 54 meter road with turning to the left. 

You could be right with the 0 meter thing but I doubt it. When I lock my phone it only sends the meteres after 3-5 bluetooth package. It sends like this when its locked:
> AR,15 M
> AR
> AR
> AR
> AR,15 M

AR is for Turning right, AL is Turning left.

Because I wasnt on the road it changed direction but when I stand on the road it is stable does not change routes ;)

I will make a video when I am on the road. So you can see it is working perfect.

The price for me is not a problem, but I like sourcing components cheaper and making things smaller ... so have read up on the way the voltage is measured: "This is a small voltage and current sense PCB. DC current is determined by measuring a voltage drop across a pair of parallel shunt resistors, then converted to a final analog voltage output by the TI INA-169. Voltage sense is accomplished by scaling to 3.3V ADC range by a precision resistor divider."
So if you could integrate this pcb into your board then all that needs to be done is: take inspiration from (replicate) the pcb layout of this board on yours with the processor,  buy a TI INA-169 ($2) and some SMD resistors. I looked for the same board (but cheaper) on ebay than that on sparkfun but couldn't find one :( !

Soldering is bad. Hot Air is the best way to do if you dont have a reflow oven. First you order a pcb. Then the stencil for it. Using solder paste over the stencil so the solder pads get solder on it. Place the smd components on the solder pads. Heat the pcb with the hot air gun and watch the magic :)

I believe you are looking for a remote like this - https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/ultimate-vesc-controller-with-oled/21922. The code for it is here https://github.com/RollingGecko/ArduBoardControler. RollingGecko has made his remote currently work this way:
"I use a 2 axis joystick. Left and right is to flip though different views on the display.
Forward is accelerating. backward is variable breaking.
One button is used to change direction. Pushing it once is for backwards . Pushing it again is back to forward. Accelerating and breaking remains.
The second button is used for speed control. It will keep the rpm on a constant level as long as you push it"

I think that @lox897 is testing RollingGecko's code and is looking to make a compact remote (exactly as you have described) that works well. He seems to want to make a few working prototypes though before selling a fully made controller in the $30-40 range (he hopes). If you do not want the screen, you can simply ask him to not include it in the product he sends you. The reason I am pushing you to that thread is that the remote you are looking for has already been made (nunchuk), one with slightly more features is being prototyped (www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/ultimate-vesc-controller-with-oled/21922/70) and the one under development here is going to have loads of features. In my eyes, this is asking a smartphone company to make a nokia 3310 because it is smaller - it is a very different product to the one the smartphone company is developing and is already available!

On the other hand, given that there will be an app to go with the remote, a lot of the fancy stuff should be done in the app to make the remote processor run faster and the remote ui less complicated. 

So if you want a finished compact remote, get a nunchuck remote or wait for @lox897 to finish making RollingGecko's code run super smooth on his remote. If you want a slightly bigger, more featured remote, wait for this one to finish being developed, then tested, then sold. I hope this makes sense :) - I didn't mean for it to be so long!

I would love to sell the remote in different sizes ... it is just the more inventory you have, the more all items cost (for each different size you have to make a different case, different screen, different code - a different sized screen has more space to put new stuff on. Then, when you manufacture it, you have to buy more products so that you can keep every size of controller in stock in EU/ America and ship it to the customer faster. We will have to see if interest for more sizes is very high, before making more sizes - there is no point selling something that already exists as those who need that can just go for that (unless a brand name becomes huge and then people go for the most 'reliable' company's product). **Please vote in the poll above if you haven't already to see interest.

I will not use the ESP, I said its the only board I have laying around for testing the bluetooth etc. The ESP is shit it always crashes. I will use a standard microcontroller. I will use the bluetooth. PS why are you using SPI screen? I am using I2C.

Btw Creating the most reliable controller in the world is my goal :sweat_smile:

Actually the max voltage for my board is 6.3V.... Because I suddenly bought a Ceramic Capicitor that has 6.3V max. All my other parts has from 150V-16V.. but that gets fixed if I buy the same cap only with 16V.

And with the sizes I meant the remote not the screen but oh well ;)

I thought so for the ESP, but was just checking. I just used the cheapest screen I could find, found a new one that uses I2C. I will be either supplying the board with 5V or 1s lipo so shouldn't need the extra voltage but good to have it I suppose. I am also eager to make this the most reliable controller in the world (the PA is overkill but should eliminate any chance of no signal!). I didn't really know how else to quantify the size of the remote - the extra size comes from the screen - the 0.7" or 0.91" could be integrated on the side of a winning-style remote and you just ride with the thumbwheel to the side and the screen pointing to your face, but that is a really uncomfortable position to hold. I may try and make the screen be pushed up rack and pinion style by a servo - when the screen is stored the remote will be smaller. The problem that comes to mind with that is water ingress between the edge of the screen and the edge of the slot. If you have thoughts on making the remote smaller please tell me! I have put the links for stuff I will buy below. Could you let me know of what chips and capacitors and resistors I will need for the transmitter and receiver when you are done with the pcb. If the pcbs are not too big I know someone who can make a tester one the DIY way.

Like the boosted board and others, basically a switch/trigger that you need to hold down in order for the thumbwheel to be active, so a kind of safety switch so that if you let go of the trigger the board doesn't fly away, and stops any accidental hitting of the thumbwheel.

That's a great idea to include an arm switch/ deadman switch @jackw and to also use that switch to select items in the menu @Sander! If there is a free digital input pin on the atmega in the remote, I think the momentary (arm/ deadman) switch should be connected from 5V to that - if the switch is in series with the pot and it is in reverse mode (and pulling back decreases the resistance and means accelerate back when in reverse mode), the board would shoot towards you when the button is pressed. I will explain this with some diagrams later as I can't explain it will with words! Good luck with the firmware @Sander!

And with the yellow there will be cruise control/horn.
When you are either breaking or have released the throttle it will honk. 
To activate the cruise control you first have to press in the "Deadman switch" to activate the throttle if not it will honk. To honk you just release the "deadman switch".

So I think I will create a pcb where the buttons are mounted on it or I will do the easy way:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/9/29f7bc47c112c872ccd5ae1782b54e6b1b631d47.png" width="391" height="500">
The red is the switch and the black is the wall around it.
Do the same way with the buttons.

I think it will be better to have a specific button for horn. The way you described it, in my perspective, is not very convenient when you ride in high speed and something happen therefore you need to horn, it will be too confusing in those critical moment (I might be over dramatic lol).

Good thinking! If I just "remove" the cruise control for now and just have the horn function instead?
I think these will be some good horns, they are small and loud:

Oooo oooo oooo I know! When you horn you pretty much would be in a situation where you need to brake right?!?!? So why not put the horn button where the throttle would be when braking? So you'd press the throttle in and it would brake? Idk this might not be the best idea... Thoughts?

hahaha yes! That would be funny if you were breaking and suddenly a loud noise comes out of nowhere!

Good thinking! but not the best idea, I think the best way is to have a seperate button for horning ;)
But giving it a second thought if you break very fast I can do it activate the horn? It seems not so dumb at all but you need to break then to activate the horn... You rather will have some speed not stand still and honking.

Maybe make this feature be 'turn-offable' in the app/ on the remote - it reminds me of a Topgear episode where the horn was attached to the brakes and that did not end too well. I will print out your initial remote this afternoon (printing 40 18650 models atm) and will see how comfortable it is/ where  more buttons could go. As everyone really likes the benchwheel style remote (it is super compact), I have been thinking of how a 1.3 inch screen could be mounted to it. The idea I am currently going to go with is a flip out remote like on a camcorder:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/1/f13c527f3bf3d0c1e343943105f285146070361f.png" width="690" height="361">
I will measure up the pcb holes location on the remote once it is printed and see what is the larges screen possible with the space available/ how much it has to be expanded to accomodate a 1.3 inch screen. I have put the hinge so far up in the diagram so when the screen is swung out to perpendicular, it does not interfer with your finger location/ ability to hit the many new buttons (thank you for all the new suggestions!). 

As far as I can understand, duty cycle to the vesc can be adjusted from 100% (full acceleration) to -100% (full brake). @Sander Could you make the spring loaded pot go from -100 to 100 duty cycle (the variable braking I was talking about earlier but couldn't explain well!). It would also be interesting to be able to adjust the max and min duty cycle on the app/ controller - so that you don't get flung off the board because at 100% the acceleration is too fast or at -100% the braking is too hard.
```

Great idea!
The 100 and -100 is the ampere to give the motors.
When its 100 its not fully 100 amps its doing some math something like: (ampere * 2) / 100

Yes I will have the fast feature of changing modes and an other feature like they choose the max speed and acceleration speed(ms)

Based on the large amount of people who have expressed their preference for a small remote, I have quickly made some renders of a 'winning' style remote with a 1.3" Oled screen that flips up from the side. I have yet to work out a way of getting the screen to stay up -  if you have any ideas please suggest them. In the renders I have not yet put the various buttons in as I wasn't sure if their position/ how many was finalised. The screen is just some dummy text and placement - please suggest what and where stuff should be on the screen. As the screen is 'flip up', you will also be able to ride with it stored. Maybe for flipping the screen, a servo with a gear instead of a servo horn could be used, then put another gear on the screen holder that rotates. I have decided also to make the hinge run along the side of the screen pcb (long side nearest thumbstick) as it will be stronger that way. I will test the size of the controller tomorrow (printing now) as ideally for the larger screen it would be 10mm bigger (if not the pcb would have to be sanded wherever possible)!

Snazzy renders:

I tried printing the remote yesterday, but half-way through the print, ABS spilled out above the nozzle -  print failed so will try that again on Monday/ Tuesday depending on when I get it cleaned up and the nozzle tightened. Luckily, before the print failed, the thumbstick finished printing. The size of the main part of the thumbstick's seems fine (don't have the main part of the remote to test it on) but the stick that attaches to the potentiometer is too thin (3 layers) and will be thickened. How is the code coming along @Sander?

Fair enough - adafruit was my go to until I learnt u8glib uses less space. Is the arduino bootloader on the chip - when you buy the leonardo it will come preinstalled but maybe not when you just buy the chip?

It only says unknown signature.

When I connect the PCB with a usb to the pc it comes up as a 'Unknown Device' because I have of course no bootloader on it... It could be the Arduino UNO's fault?

I am using Adafruit's library if you are wondering.. ;)
It is easier to use.

@Print3r the method I will use now will work pretty good! And the link to that Arduino needs a FTDI to program. its no USB interface unlike the leonardo.

Here is the right one:
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Pro-Micro-ATmega32U4-5V-16MHz-Replace-ATmega328-Arduino-HOT-MC-/262855140223?hash=item3d3363237f:g:NIcAAOSwCU1Yv6Wk

The thing that is stupid this only cost like 2 gbp and the ATmega32U4 chip from digikey cost 2.7 gbps.
And the best thing is the board for 2 gbp comes with the bootloader. Its cheaper because of manufactering.

So I will order a bunch of those ;)

Not needing an FTDI to program is nice (I have already got one but for an extra 60p not needing one is worth it). The board looks nicely made (not loads of flux everywhere like on some clones)! Economics of scale can be rather amusing sometimes ... pcb + chip + resistors + usb port + bootloaded chip is cheaper than the chip on its own ... guess I too will take the board then!

So the pcb from oshpark cost 2.5$, and the arduino pro micro atmega32u4 cost the 2.54$.

Then manufacturing costs, shipping cost and listing cost (if on ebay/ amazon). So more like $20-25 for those buying it, depending on how many are ordered! But $6-15 is a good hardware price.

The controller looks great - thanks @rwxr for printing and shipping it to @Sander.  I assume on the home screen what is shown at the start is the duty cycle - are you thinking of adding the various other things from a previous picture? If you don't like the menu subrow thing, you could just narrow it down to the essentials e.g. brightness (click on the word brightness and a slider appears under brightness that you can scroll up and down, click again to confirm and slider disappears), lights (click on word lights and on, off button shows up beneath row 'lights' push up or down to scroll between them and then click to enter), efficiency mode (again on off - speed and power limiter tuned in the app)? Most of the settings functionality should be built into the app - there is more screen space and you shouldn't be changing it while riding!

I have nothing against the current settings, but they are quite small and I can't make out what the highlighted row says in the video. What do you think of the flip up screen and the screen being vertical - should have time the weekend after this one and the whole of the next week to work on a printable design if people would prefer that - here it seems like your fingers will obstruct the screen whilst riding? Despite my many suggestions, great work @Sander for making so much progress on the controller code!

Well I will find a way out to make it cooler, searching up subrows, etc :blush:

I think it should be possible to change the max speed and max acceleration on the app.
And on the controller you could do the same and if you dont want the "Custom" mode you can just change it to "Beginner", "Advanced" or "Experienced"

The finger will probably be in the way, but I hold the remote a bit different. So it will not be a issue for me.

I dont know if its possible to flip it vertically but I can try to make a new code for vertically screen later when I am done with this one :)

Have fun making the display cooler - be inventive! I didn't really understand how you can change the screen colour in code - on the internet you seem to buy a blue oled screen or a white one?

You are right, I think changing the mode is very important. I will design the new controller next weekend for the bigger screen - you have set the design standard very high! Finish your setup first before working on the vertical version - it is very kind of you to do both though you will probs use yours!

You cant change the color on the display but you can buy a 16bit high resoulition display but it works much different. You create the menu/pages in an Editor where you commicate with the UART port with the oled display.
And ofcourse the OLED with colors are 10 times more expensive ;)

I have changed the menu again, I like it much better now.

On the home screen:
**Top left** is the distance you have droven total, **top middle** is the time. **top right** is the battery percent left of your board.
**Bottom left** is the amps, **bottom middle** is the potentiometer value(debugging for now), **bottom right** is the volts.

In the **middle of the middle** where the 20 number is. It is the current speed in km/h but you can change it in the settings to mph in the future..

Amazing work - the layout is super clear. I do still think the extra screen size would be good as at the start of the video if not in full screen, it is hard to read some numbers (but I suppose you don't need to see battery percentage and km left etc. whilst riding). Where were you thinking of putting the turn signals - on either side of the speed?

I have no problem reading any values.
I know other people will have because they need glasses or do not see very well small object.
The easy fix is using a bigger display or use your phone to change the settings.

When you have connected your phone to the bluetooth with a destination to go to.
It will automatically change the home page to destination page.
Then the speed becomes irrelevant so it gets smaller font and the turn signal will replace the big 20 number. 

Or I can move the speed/(meters to turn) to the very left and the turn signal will be on the right so your hand will only block a bit of the 20 number so you get the speed and the turn signals.

I think moving the speed to the left is better as (though I have never eboarded yet - building my board next month or after september) I assume that when riding you lose a sense of speed after a while and could be going way faster than you would like to be going. Also, I don't know if you have tested visibility outside in the sun @Sander, but I think the sun will make the smaller numbers hard to see (though they are of course not as important as the big speed number)!

You will not have any problem seeing the screen in the sun.
It is OLED and it has a bright brightness.
And not much reflections.

I will try to create the same Menu thing in u8glib now..

U8glib also means you can rotate text ... vertical screen? ;) 

e.g. from  http://henrysbench.capnfatz.com/henrys-bench/arduino-displays/oled-arduino-blue-1-3-sh1106-display-quick-start-tutorial/ 
void u8g_string(uint8_t a) {
  u8g.drawStr(30+a,31, " 0");
  u8g.drawStr90(30,31+a, " 90");
  u8g.drawStr180(30-a,31, " 180");
  u8g.drawStr270(30,31-a, " 270");
}

Had a thought for a feature that would be cool but hard to do: have on the iphone a grey pixel grid of the screen and allow people to design their own layout. Would be super difficult though and too many font sizes might be chosen so the processor wouldn't have enough space for it all.

Battery indicators can just use three seven segment displays and drivers or a row of leds - OLEDs look great but really push the arduino if all of the screen is used (really slow refresh rate) so I try to avoid them unless really necessary. But totally agree, animations are key if you have a screen - the splashscreen on startup has to have a super cool animation!

@Print3r How many lines of text can you fit in vertical way?

I think at least 8 you should.. that is just enough for 8s battery pack to see individual voltages.
Another way for 12s, it can be even made with 6lines but just in 2 columns..

You can get almost any size of font imaginable ... yes you can fit all 8s/12s battery voltages on one screen, you just have to find enough analog inputs for each of the 8 or 12 cells and would have to build a voltage divider for each one (5V atmegas can only read voltages between 0-5V)!

Hey mates,

to be honest, i didn't read the whole thread.
BUT
I started making a simple Remote (With screen and throttle settings, menu, etc.) myself and got some code together.
Since i will switch jobs soon, i stopped all my DIY projects to get ready to move.

Maybe you can use anything of my (amateurish) code.

It is I2C Oled.

On the videos above I used adafruits libraries.
You cant see the refresh rates.

But I think I fixed the refresh rate by moving all the voids before the setup and the loop so it gets intalized before getting displayed or something like that. or not....

The SPI is almost 4 times faster then the I2C.

[quote="lox897, post:163, topic:22055, full:true"]
How do you guys display variables with U8Glib?
[/quote]

I finally found it out. Took me a few hours to figure out how.
Its pretty hard to find when you dont know where to look.
Espically when the U8Glib doesn't tell you how to insert values.

So I found out to display integer value:

> const char *text= "";

> int a = 1;

>   char b[5]; //Should be good enough for 4 characters. -100 to 100. Increase [5] if you need higher numbers.

>   String str;
>   
>   str = String(a);
>   
>   str.toCharArray(b, 5); //Should be good enough for 4 characters. -100 to 100. Increase 5 if you need higher numbers.
>
> text = b;
>
> u8g.drawStr(0, 54, text);

And here is for the float 
> char result[8]; // Buffer big enough for 7-character float
> float value = 25.02;
>  dtostrf(value, 6, 2, result); // Leave room for too large numbers!
> text = result;

Well I will  have a current sensor on the board, rx side.
It will get powered on when you are charging your board so  you can see how much you have charged your board in mAh.
That allows you to see how much you have used and how much  you have charged.
So on the remote on the oled will show precisely how much mAh or percent is left of the battery ;)

That day is not very far from today!
Only 1 - 3 month left and the mold + the code should be ready, the receiver too.

Which LED's were you gonna use? Only one waiting for HIGH or LOW signal?
Because I will atleast add the feature for neopixel.
With the neopixel you can change every single light to whatever color.

So you choose which led configuration you have on your remote like: "Neopixel" or "Regular led".

I think the neopixel feature is definitely worth adding, although I am only using a standard (neutral white) monocolor LED Strip and I already have the 12V power supply that it runs on from my SBEC.
So for me personally I would just need a remote controlled inbuilt switch on the receiver or the "Regular LED" function.

I don't know if many people are still watching this thread but here is a poll of how many that wants to buy it. 
Before you vote:
**CURRENTLY ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH IPHONE(Bluetooth)**

OLED Remote on the receiver side includes:

- Current Sensor (Reads ACCURATE Battery Percent/mAh)
- Bluetooth (Custom Remote Modes + Graph of ride tour + Turn by Turn Navigation)
- Lights Output

On the OLED Remote:

- 0.96" Display White
- Easy Menu to Use
- Turn by Turn Navigation System
- Shows current voltage, ampere, rpm, battery percent, local time, speed km/h-mph etc.
- Custom Acceleration speed
- Limit Max Speed
- Statistics
- Turn off and on lights, change color and blink mode.
- Create custom ride mode on iphone/remote.
- Total Distance droven(km/miles).
- Cruise Control.
- Over kill connection range(reliable remote).
- And more to come (please suggest)

I will make that you can update the remote at home.

The price is $59.9 // Cheaper then the Unreliable WINNING Remote

I do this poll to see how many I need to produce:
[poll max=1]
* Yes
* Maybe
* No
* Price is too high

Doing some progress...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbinadcS58w&feature=youtu.be

You can turn on and off the VESC, its because when the voltage is low, it will tell you,when you brake and the rpm is very small the VESC's will turn off automatically.

The Arduino is 24/7 on for now, in this version.
Its connected via the antispark, it has not fried yet, 2.3A tested.

The update of the Ampere may seem slow, because its average motor ampere.

You may ask why it is Color in the Power section on the OLED.
Its because the section is actually the Lights section.
I renamed it to Power from Lights because it was the only function section that are working.

I'm just sending through the throttle signal though so lots of "missing features" though really I wanted to be sure the connection and programming was solid without needing to worry about extra data parsing and transmission.  Just got some PCBs made they are $2.80 a piece shipped if you get 10 (or $5.60 if you get 5 it doesn't matter the cost is shipping not making them).

I'm also curious if anyone knows the legal ramifications for selling a transmitter and receiver that hasn't been certified by the FCC or whoever handles that in the EU or elsewhere.

I know from Ada Fruit sites you can sell kits with FCC certified radios and the kit doesn't need to be certified and you can make prototypes (I think up to 5 of a given thing) without having to do anything but beyond that it gets murky what you have to do or cannot do.

I just wonder if aside from cease and desist order if there is a major financial penalty that makes it not worth what probably will amount to a few hundred to low thousands of dollars (if the risk is a $10,000 fine I wouldn't personally do it without the certification since that costs like $10,000 from what I've read).  There's also self certification for FCC too though so like I said need someone who knows the law and technical details.

Have been on holiday and not quite motivated because a guy named Alextech on this forum I bought from (Dual Hub Motor, Custom 12S4P Battery) has never arrived to me, been shipped once and never again, when it was in Norway it got returned and he didn't ship it again, he said he will send me the hubs but he went silent again... Spent around $440 on it. 

Thats why I dont have done alot of progress because I have nothing to keep me motivated. If I had those I would work on my remote non stop beause I want to ride the board. I have waited over 130 days for the parts.

Sorry to hear it but glad you got to post your experience too.  I bought my motor and batteries from hobby king and got the rest of my components from  just wanted to put it out there that not all the small vendors like diy have such problems typically.  (Usually items are in shipping within a day or two of the order and they just updated the site some to make viewing old orders easier)

---

That said make sure you don't fall into the traps of not knowing shipping or customs fees that will need to be covered for any physical good and lead times for components and possibly getting bad batches that need to be replaced these are realities for anyone trying to ship any physical goods.

That's a real bummer and I am sure that you will get your money eventually back from him after Paypal disputes.....but to be honest dude...this remote is really amazing and you could organize a group buy here and make many times over on this remote than what you lost on Alex. I am pretty sure there will be tons of buyers here for this remote...and there is nothing more motivating than a stream of money that you can later spend on ESK8 :) :slight_smile:  There you go ...that's your motivation :slight_smile:

Agree this looks like a lot of well done work so far and most of the controllers seem to be pretty flakey at best and dangerous at worst.  Haven't checked out your code yet and I had some patches to my own due to failures while operating but would just make sure you CYA and make sure you understand all your costs risks time for assembly and shipping.  Taking orders isn't something you should rush into.

I will create these for my Reciever atleast. Because I dont have space inside the receiver layout. 
But if I make an "addon" on it I have no problem with the space ;)

So I have come up with this little guy. It has an antenna and I hope the signal will be steady :slight_smile: 
Should be better with that antenna then the inbuilt copper antenna.

This would be nice in terms of general purpose can get it surface mounted and all but I'm kinda curious why not just put an Atmel chip or other MCU right on here as well.  When I made my PCB I was just doing something to get rid of the wire clutter, but if you're going to get one with assembly as well think you might as well just go the extra couple of steps to put the mcu right on here with the radio.  This way would just be one PCB, all you need from say an ATMEGA328P is the 7 lines to the NRF chip and going into it just needs regulated 3.3V (it has an internal oscillator that will run the chip at 8MHz if you don't have an external one).  For reading the potentiometer (controller trigger) just need one of the analog pins from the MCU and for writing PWM just need one of the PWM capable digital pins (receiver to ESC).

---

Extra note, would need to be sure to break out the pins for programming the Atmel chips as well, still it is probably worth it if you're going to have the fab house do assembly.

---

Also not sure if you've seen them already or not but there is an ESP8266 (I'm pretty sure is the model) that has wifi and can be reprogrammed but I haven't really checked out doing ad-hoc type radio to radio communication with them (don't have one just seen videos) they might be worth checking out before going the route of custom assembled PCBs.  Regarding the built in antennae it has worked fine for me so far but for whatever reason I would feel more comfortable with a real wire coil antennae.

No, I am not giving up, the signal is terrible and the nrf lacks many features. 
I will be moving on to another transceiver that has good range, encryption and private network.
It even has a RSSI feature. (Receive Signal Strength Indicator). Itâs a measurement of how strong the transmission was when a message was received. So I can create a little signal test icon for debugging.

The radio is even license free.

Generally dont like to use those because you send data and receive with using client.println (basically serial) etc, which is not fast enough for getting values from vesc, send to controller and send back to vesc. If there is any way to send packages to each other like on the NRF (which may be possible) I will give it a try again.

Ok, I have been testing with bluetooth to bluetooth(HC-06).
It is super fast and the code I wrote is pretty solid. The range is amazing! Through 3 floors down(3m heigh) with doors closed. 

I have managed it to send potentiometer value and receive the voltage, amps etc. So far its working good. 

But this version I am using bytes because the .write function is a uint8_t that I believe is 8bit so the maximum number/bit is 255.

I might give the ESP8266 MCU a try, because the same code will work for that.

@banjaxxed and @GrecoMan the cost will be depending on what you choose like. Current sensor and Switch with the receiver so you can turn off and on the board by powering the remote. With the current sensor get accurate reading of how much battery capacity you have left, and it estimates how far you can drive with it.

Interested in the complete package, the whole shebang. Was also looking at Wajdi's one but far too expensive IMO, hoping this is less costly, maybe I'm not realistic about the effort and cost that goes into building them. I may need to wait for mass-market adoption.

I think this is pretty accurate:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G6cbB9tymxwAx_ul-3dK_ecZLHnj8iVudTKXk6aNmv8/edit#gid=0

I looked at making my own into a thing to sell for people but got super paranoid about all the regulations around selling things with radiators.  After talking with a friend who does product development he told me basically any circuit that has a potential oscillator/loop in it basically has to go through certification before they can actually produce it.  The certification process isn't impossible but it is costly so the only way to recoup the cost is to sell them at a pretty large scale which makes this a somewhat risky endeavor given our community isn't absolutely everybody :)

I still made my own.  The radios were $2 a piece but I bought 10 and the arduino pro mini 3.3V I used for mine were also around $2 a piece and I got 5 (only need 2 of each but good to have spares).  The PCB I made for my own version of this cost $28 to get 10 of them shipped, any lower quantity still cost $28, because of shipping.  Aside from those components need at a bare minimum a potentiometer or a hall effect sensor and a battery (I used a 800 mAh).

---

Basically this is a good deal if everyone is building their own and people buy in groups of 5 at least and split components from sets of 10 then you can get decent prices on everything and not have lots of spares.

Right now it display's how much battery mAh you use, how many km you have left, battery percentage left, ampere, voltage, current speed(km/h) :)

aaaand I am experimenting with bluetooth because it auto connects to each others so other can't interfere I hope.

Hey guys, this all looks crazy cool! Im in the process of building my first board and would like to try to build one of these as well or buy one. 
1) What does my board need to take full advantage of this remote? I have a dual hub motor 1800w 75kv, dual vesc, 12s2p 18650 battery. Do I need a bms to take full advantage? if so which one do you recomend that is reliable? Do I need a hm-10 in my vesc or just the remote? would I need the hm-10 on 1 or both of my vesc?

2) Will this be open sourced for us to try to build this remote for ourselves? any timeline?

Well, if you want to unlock your board to the full potential you use the remote I am making. With that I mean you can see precisely how much mAh left. Change the settings on the VESC with the remote. Different speed curves. Braking lights.
Get data of the ride on the board displayed on interactive graph on the phone.

With the hm-10 you are talking about, with this remote you will receive two things, a remote and a receiver with current sensor and electric switch on.

Yes, I am now using other radio modules. The one I am using is amazing, the package is encrypted, the signal is very strong. From a room with door closed to a wall 15 meters away no signal change. It is documented that 150 meters should be no problem. With this one I can display the signal strength in dBm. So to the weekend I will have a working remote, but with the oled, connection to vesc will take some time. I am starting from scratch to make it solid ;)

Yeah I am still working on it, its going slow because my board is made out of carbon fibre that kills the range + school. I have a demo working though, but it is not what I want, I want it to be super responsive and good range. To acheive that I need to filter to use low power noise amplifier and filter more the power.

My problem is finding a suitable radio to use. Right now I am using one with 16-bit encryption, so if another have the same controller it will not interrupt you, if I use nrf24l01 there are only pipes I can change and it gets more and more common. What I need is an auto-binding(like bluetooth), that feature I can make self but what is the chance for other to have the same id?

I got it working super good with 2 STM32, but I faced many issues. First was the update rate of the oled, then using oled and the radio did not work. Got that finally working. When getting details from the vesc, then the STM32 just crashes etc.
