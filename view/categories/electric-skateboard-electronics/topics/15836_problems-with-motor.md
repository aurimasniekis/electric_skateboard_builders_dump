Could be loose motor connectors. Could be your not riding it properly. What's your setup/parts?

if it's the vesc in current mode that's normal.  put it on the ground and ride it and it's likely fine.

It could also be mounting screws being too long. If so they will touch the stators when trying to spin the motor.

maybe try the bldc test again and see if it passes.  if it passes I'm pretty sure the motor is fine.     Some people think they have a bad motor as on the bench it reacts strangely but under load, when riding, its fine.

Does it shutter only at the start or is it impossible to ride ? 

Also, can you post your setting in the bldc tool ?

Its kind of out in left field, but have you checked the PPM setup?  Turn on display and make sure that the MAX, MID & MIN are set correctly.

unplug your receiver when you do your motor detection

probably shorted motor.  or maybe the phase wires are touching if your failing the test

```
Set the control mode in the PPM tab to disabled. 
Write the settings. 
Do the motor detection. 
When successfully then the apply button. 
Write the settings. 
Enable your control mode again in the ppm tab. 
Write the settings.
