Hello, builders. Recently I got overpowered power supply.

It has 1500W of power, adjustable voltage and is capable to deliver 35amps.

I replaced pot and setted desired voltage to 42V. I'll be charging 10s3p pack with BMS. Only thing left to do is to efficiently limit the current from 35 to 2 amps, because discharged cells can require more amps. ANY IDEAS HOW TO LIMIT THE CURRENT (exept resistors, and aditional loads)?

limit the current from 2 to 4 amps, because discharged cells can require more amps.

It is much better to charge any battery always SLOWLY. So i would not recommend to set the charger to 4A. Just save your time and leave it on default ;)
