I'm in Canada and looking for a low quantity of **genuine** LG, Panasonic, Samsung, etc. cells.

Besides @NAF has anyone ordered from this store? They appear to ship from Turkey.

NKON only seems to ship FedEx to Canada and want 30EUR to do so. OK I guess if ordering large quantities.
GearBest doesn't even appear to ship here :-(
Any other sites I should investigate?

Thanks!

It looks like they're UPS only to Canada. $28USD to ship 4 cells really sucks.
I would be better off buying from a local Vape shop.

Hehe, i first though it was a new Finnish battery store, judging from the name (LiitoKala = GlidingFish). :joy:

Maybe you can still use them for something?

If not remember to dispose of them safely!
