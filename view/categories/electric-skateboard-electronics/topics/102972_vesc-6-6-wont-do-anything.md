I have a vesc 6.6, been running for a while no problems. Just today I was riding my board and the motor completely cut out, no throttle or brake. I checked all my connections and everything seems fine, I checked the motor and it has no issues at all. I decided to plug the vesc into my computer and it won't show up in my com ports, I tried multiple cables and I plugged my Bluetooth into the UART port and it still won't connect. There's is a blue light on when it's powered, and my remote still connects to the board. Being in college I use my board to get around a lot and I really don't have money for another vsec.
Edit: I discovered that when I plug it into my computer, it reads "could not read firmware version. Make sure that the selected port really belongs to the VESC"
