Of course it`s possible!
But heavy and pricy...

Overkill, expensive. Typically, 4WD will be found on a mountain board but not on an Electric Longboard.

The ngv board.  4 hub motors.  It's overkill.  U can get good efficiently with a pulley and belt with one motor.  I can good efficiency with two hub motors.  4 hub motors...unless ur doing mountains it's more inefficient than 2

Torque beat me to it

Weight will be a problem. If you want to = be cool, do 2 rear hub motors and one SK3 149kv for kill climbing.
