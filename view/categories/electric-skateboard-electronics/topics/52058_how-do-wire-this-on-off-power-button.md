Hello!

Can some one please tell me how I'm suppose to wire this? I'm assuming black to black and then white to which white wire? and does it even matter as long as just black is to black? thanks!

pics, and also you cant just put a on off button on battery wires, it will blow on the first press probably if not on the first, a day later

ask for the instructions from the seller, the xt plug goes to the battery, 2 of those wires should be for the switch and the other 2 should be for the switched LEDs
