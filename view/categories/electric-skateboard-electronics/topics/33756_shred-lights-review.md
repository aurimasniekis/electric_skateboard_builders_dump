Too lazy to watch video, how's your battery life, I've found mine to be a bit disappointing , charge lights more often than remote and 1 red light shuts off randomly ðŸ¤”

Have you seen one opened up? I'm curious if it's some standard cell size or pouch lipo

I'm likely gonna open up the buggy red light, I think it's just a sleeve, I'll give it some heat incase there's any adhesives

If it's a standard cell in there, I'm replacing it with max capacity cell. Hoping for 18350 or close enough to fit 18350 ðŸ˜‹ (not 18650)
