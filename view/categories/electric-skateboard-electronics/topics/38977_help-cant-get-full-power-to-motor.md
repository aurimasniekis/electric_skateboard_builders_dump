 So I have all my batteries hooked up and I tested the voltage coming from my vesc and it was only 3 volts,  each battery has 16.8, is this normal? I Have not been able to get full power to my motor.

Post a photo of your setup, how you're measuring, and what your configuration settings are in the BLDC tool. We can't help until we have enough information.

it looks like you have one or more of your batteries connected backwards. Looking at the connectors, it seems like you have them going positive to positive, rather than positive to negative.

What the hell is going on here...?

You have two packs in parallel with the positive going nowhere, and another pack with the negative in parallel and positive going to antispark.. You're running like 11 volts nominal assuming each of those packs are 3s

The batteries are wired In series? And the board ran before.  I soldered in the on and off switch and then since then and a spark I can't get full power out of the motor. Turns on, spins the motor, just not full power

Well if you're running 10~ volts, you're probably triggering the low voltage cutoff which is why it's not spinning very much. Your battery is wired up wrong. Disconnect it and try again.

Post your schematic here if you want us to help you fix it, but it makes no sense right now. It's surprising you haven't blown them up yet.

You're basically running your board off of just one of those batteries. The other two are just sitting there not connected fully. Looc closely at the connections. 

They should go Vesc negative>> 
antispark negative>>
battery 1 negative(then comes out positive)>>
battery 2 negative(then comes out positive)>>
battery 3 negative(then comes out positive)>>
antispark positive>>
vesc positive.

Nope, still wrong. Look at the top left two batteries. Red to red. That's not right.

All three batteries are wired in series, they are 4s. This is what I ran before and everything was fine.  I soldered In the anti spark switch, and one of the batteries sparked on me, and I didn't know if that ruined my vesc, or shorted the motor, @MysticalDork @Jinra

It's possible you permanently damaged something on your setup due to the incorrect setup of the batteries. Listen to @MysticalDork's reply and setup your batteries to run in a neg -> pos daisy chain fashion.

See here, this is how your battery should be hooked up if you want it in series.

Sounds like you need a new switch. Unfortunately, those switches are prone to failure. Where did you get it from? If it was , it may be under warranty.

It was from there. But I cut the connectors off so I could get it to fit, would that void warranty?

If you remove shrink wrap or desolder anything typically it voids any sort of warranty.  Not sure they'd cover this anyhow since it's not likely manufacturer error or component failure in regular use (maybe they cover it though worth checking).  Personally big proponent of just using a loop key with xt-90 antispark plugs far less failure prone and added safety feature if you make it easy to pull while riding.

Don't worry about the switch you don't need it uneless you want it to look cool. If you just unsolder the switch it will work normally. Your lucky you didn't fry the batteries

Don't mean to pile on here but either heat shrink or cover all of the soldered wires with tape or something.  You are asking for shorts the way it is.   Also, there is a great "diagrams" forum post where so many of us posted diagrams of our setups, check it out and all will be clear.  Just search "diagrams" and you will see the post.

So you can put the loop in just the negative wire?

I personally would put it on the positive wire, but yes. It just breaks the circuit. If you need more info, just search "loop key" here on the forum. Lots of info and advice to be had.

Sorry missed your question but yeah use the search for loop key or antispark loop key and quite a few threads outlining different options.  Since the whole circuit needs to be complete for current to flow it can be basically anywhere between the battery and the "load" or VESC in this case, positive or negative shouldn't really make a difference.  If you use an "antispark" instead of just regular xt-90 added benefit the connectors won't spark when plugging them in if you use higher voltage at some point (10 or 12S can fry the connectors while power is flowing into the capacitors on the VESC).
