Alright, ive looked though the lists of 10s*** BMSs that Bestech has and idk if there are more brands, or better ones to choose from so I figured I would ask here. 

Im looking for a BMS that can safely handle 100a constant, has bluetooth for monitoring cell life, and also has a built in eswitch(or the capability for it) 

budget is unlimited bc Id like the peace of mind

Maybe this tiny bms? Don't know if the switch is integrated. Good communication so far and quoted â‚¬220.- incl. shipping to EU.

Haven't yet but going to buy this.

Pls tell me about the switch when you know

thx
