Hey Guys, an interesting topic appeared on the ESK8 subreddit asking 

>Does a focbox need airflow In order to work or can it be incased inside a board?

and that got me thinking. How do you guys keep your ESC's and electronics from overheating?

Boosted seems to do so via Enclosures with fins + [heatsinks](https://boostedboards.com/blog/technical-progress-part-i-electronics/)

Heatsinks with good airflow/ fans keeps mine cool :grin:

Show us! we need some inspiration! No reason Boosted can make a good looking solution and we can't.

Focbox has a good heatsink
today it pulled me 70amps for 30seconds and it only got to 80celsius
im 100kg or so with the board and i went like 5kmh on the hill

In my opinion no need to cool it more

Hereâ€™s how I cool my focboxes. Air scoop, and fan to blow air past the aluminum heatsink. This allows the focboxes to be water tight in my enclosure and still get amazing cooling.

@GrecoMan thatâ€™s a heatsink for the 4.12 vesc correct? How come you have the bottom fets being cooled only? Also looks like your design doesnâ€™t use direct fets, so there will be very little cooling compared to a vesc with direct Fets. Kinda reminds me of the heatsinks Chaka makes for his vescâ€™s.

in a dual config (unless youâ€™re SPECIAL) just bottom fets is plenty. but yea, itâ€™s just a simple mod to vescs. honesty, for me, the biggest perk is just having a dual vesc platform with everything securely mounted and all ports still open and accessible

This is my 95% Solution.  I'm still trying to work on a way to make the whole thing water resistant but I don't get much time to figure everything out at once.  Dual Focbox with the CNC case from Kuglis.  So far I haven't upped my motor amps but to 70 each.  However the only problem is I can't find a hill steep enough to even get these motors above 55A Each.  Plus this case keeps them super cool.

Dam thatâ€™s a hot. I just fear everything gets too hot and stuff. Want to take every precaution possible.

What happened ??

@GrecoMan sick. Iâ€™m surprised only naytech is getting on the Dual but together VESC train like Boosted, any eta?

@JohnA

What kind of build you making?

@E1Allen maybe a grommet would surffife in keeping out dust and water while making the enclosure fin fit snug?  

   
@scepterr Of course you have a solution you absolute madman lol, any improvements youâ€™ve seen so far? Also about to hit you up with another request ðŸ˜›

I have airscoops for my FOCboxes:

I recently found a bunch of old CPU heat sinks at work, I'm wondering if I could adapt them to attach straight to mine.

For that matter, I can probably get more if anyone's interested...

Running dual vesc helps a huge amount. 

Im a big guy and if i run my board conservatively with 1 focbox i can reach the temperature limit going up some local hills. If i have the same board running dual i can ride as aggressively as i like up the same hills without ever even reaching 40 in a sealed enclosure.

Actually to keep things abit simpler, it doesn't always have to be with a heatsink. if you run higher volts, it's running cooler already. The best way to run cool is to avoid heat in the first place :smiley:
