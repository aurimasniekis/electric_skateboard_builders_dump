On my benchwheel remote when first powered on the battery (power) lights all come on (all three) but then drop down to only one light.  This never seems to change regardless of power level of the remote.  Does anyone else have this issue?  Is the remote faulty?  Am I just reading the dang thing wrong?

It's fine, the other three lights are only used for the proper bench wheel. If I fully charge mine, it lasts a few days with lots of use

That was my guess.  Love the remote, but non-functioning LEDs is an annoyance.  Thanks!

Mine light up on charging. The top two lights show when the remote is in low power or normal riding modes. Right after you turn the remote on, if you press the power button, it will switch modes.
