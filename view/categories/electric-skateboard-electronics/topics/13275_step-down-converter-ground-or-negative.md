So I bought a DC Step Down Converter ([DC Converter 48V 36V 24V 50V Step Down To 12V 3A](http://www.ebay.com/itm/272076571075?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)) to power lights, usb charger, etc.  I am confused though.

The connectors are V+ In, Ground, V+ Out.  Is Ground the Negative in this scenario?
