I think the gold standards are the Samsung 25Rs. They're are solid cell with a solid continuous discharge rate (20A) and a great pulse discharge rate (100A). 

There are definitely some fantastic packs built with LGs Panasonics and A123s. Here's the cells I considered along with some basic specs. 

* A123 26650: 70A Continuous, 120A Pulse, 2500mAh
* Basen IMR 26650 40A Continuous, 60A Pulse, 4500mAh
* LG HE2: 20A Continuous, 35A Pulse, 2500mAh
* LG HE4: 20A Continuous, 35A Pulse, 2500mAh
* LG HD2: 25A Continuous, 2000mAh
* LG HD2C: 20A Continuous, 2100mAh
* LG HG2: 20A, 30A Continuous, 3000mAh
* Samsung 25R: 20A Continuous, 100A Pulse, 2500mAh (Green = Newer, Better longevity/cycles. Sometimes listed as 25R5)
* Samsung 25R: 20A Continuous, 100A Pulse, 2500mAh (Blue = Older)
* Samsung 20R: 22A Continuous, 2000mAh

I am personally trying to decide between samsung 25Rs, Lg HE4s, or Lg HG2s. For my 12s4p build, I am leaning towards the HE4s since they are cheaper.

Yeah those are the main cells that I think most deliberate over. Between those it usually comes down to price vs what setup you need. For example I decided that I went for the lowest price per capacity (and found a great deal on Samsung 25Rs which decided it) Someone else may be looking for a solid discharge rate (if they're only a 2 parallel pack for example) and may opt for the HG2 or even A123 instead of a Samsung.

I stand corrected. I just found the HG2s to be slightly more than I wanted to spend. Definitely a fantastic cell though!

@STREETSURFER I've seen it cheaper on [gearbest](http://www.gearbest.com/batteries/pp_242228.html) and [fasttech](https://www.fasttech.com/products/1420/10004182/2533800-authentic-lg-18650hg2-3-6v-3000mah-rechargeable) but the sales come and go. Definitely be careful. I can't say those are the sites I can fully recommend. Some have had no issues while others have had some pretty bad experiences.

With regards to choosing a cell for a DIY set up, keeping watthours the of the battery pack the same, is there a benefit to running a higher voltage set up with lower amps (12s2p)  verses a lower voltage set up with high amperage (6s4p)? I've just started into looking into making a battery pack a though know if I fully understand the benefits of one over the other. A system with a higher voltage would draw less amps but does that directly translate into less stress on the motors or it ends up being equivalent?If it influences the decision I am 220 lbs

Never heard of Fenix batteries. I did some searching on reddit and endless-sphere, but I didn't find a single post about Fenix 26650 batteries. I found 1 about a Fenix 18650 battery, but they only mention them very briefly. Probabaly not one I'd trust right now.....but apparently they make great lights! :smiley:

I think there's some discord about Efest, but over-all I believe the e-bike community doesn't trust them and the vaping community trusts them a little bit, but not much. I think some cells are better than others from what I've found.

If you want some great info, there's some amazing testing going on over in some vaping forums that I found. Check out his explaination [here](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/blog-entry/18650-battery-ratings-picking-a-safe-battery-to-vape-with.7447/#comment-13213) and his results [here](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/blog-entry/list-of-battery-tests.7436/).

Thanks for the reply, if I decide to proceed with this battery pack thing I think I'm screwed, cause I only have acess to the Samsung 26F ones and they have a Max. Discharge Current of 5200mA, that's way too low, right? I don't really know how to handle that number when having a series/parallel setup, for example, I'd like to start with 6S2P, how about that? Thanks!

The only benefit to higher voltage is faster speed with the same kv motor and keeping esc cooler and batteries with a lower amp draw.  Ur motor will perform the same with higher or lower voltage if the kv is adjusted as well.  Not hotter or cooler.

100A pulse means that per the manufacturer, the cell can handle a split second current draw of 100 Amps. Having said that, I would only look at that as breathing room. Definitely not something the cell can sustain.

So with that in mind, I would not recommend a 6s2p setup with these, or any, Lithium-Ion battery. The lower the number of cells in series (thus lower voltage), the higher the amp draw will be. So the 6s is already pretty low in that sense. I would strongly recommend against any 2p Li-Ion pack, unless you're considering a larger cell (a 26650 instead of 18640) and a larger series count 8-10s

I suppose that would work. I would still recommend a BMS though, but there's no consensus on that. For protection, many argue that the VESC does a good enough job (which I think it does) to not need a BMS. For charging, some just use an external balance charger while others just rely on the relative stability of Li-Ion cells (at least compared to Li-Po cells) to not become too unbalanced. 

I decided to kind of meld the two ideas together. I'm bypassing the BMS for discharging and instead relying on the VESC for voltage and current cutoff (protection). I did that so i could use a pretty cheap BMS that has a low discharge rate, since it didn't matter if it has a low discharge rate. In essence I'm only using a BMS for balance charging, so I would only have to carry around a simple power source with a simple DC power jack and just plug it in to charge

You add charge/discharge rates when they're connected in parallel, not in series. You also add capacity in parallel. You add voltage in series, but not capacity/discharge.

## \#30 Posted by: Okami Posted at: 2016-07-26T21:11:24.729Z Reads: 363

```
By adding batteries in series you increase voltage. 1x cell = 3.6v nominal (li ion) / 3.7v (lipo), 6x cells = 3.6/3.7x 6 = 21.6v (aka 24v)

When paralleling, you increase total capacity and also discharge ''capacity'' or rate. E,g, - joining 2x cells, who has 2500mah each and 10A discharge, you get 5000mah and 20A discharge.

Basically, by adding two (or more) in parallel, you make one ''bigger'' battery with the same voltage. 

You can combine series and parallel. combine 6 ''packs'' in series, and get the 24v (21.6 nominal), where each ''pack'' might consist of multiple cells,

Search around. Someone might have explained this better.

Thanks, that totally clarifies it! I knew about the voltage and amperage but not the charge/discharge rates. So you could in theory use a lot of low dicharge rate cells in parallel (maybe cheaper) with the drawback of adding a lot of weight right? See you!

Yes, although.. it seems more cost effective just to get ''decent'' cells.. and not mess around with many low discharge ones.. unless you get them for ''dirt cheap''.. like salvage them from somewhere or get them for hald price, idk

Price will tell your the best option.. there''s an option to build a high capacity pack, since for higher capacity cells discharge rates are usually lower. 

Here's a good infographic I found in one of the vaping forums, there's some russian text but you should be able to get the right idea.. (I hope there's no copyright, otherwise I might just direct to the original source)

So yes, by adding many cells in parallel, you will soon come across how much space do you really have to house all of these cells.. There might be extra hassle balancing or getting a protection for them, but as I have not built a battery pack yet, cannot comment decently on this matter.

Hey guys,

I found an EU battery builder who has been cool & responsive, but he seems fixed on different cells from what you guys are saying...  This is latest I got:

Okay 1 vesc per board, so not crazy high power :D I think we can install regular 10a cells.

If you can have pack with dimensions 53cm*14cm*2cm and in one spot height from 2cm to 4.5cm(for bms 12x12cm) then you have 48cells.
That equals to 6s8p - 22V 26Ah   ~520Wh
Bms will be good for 60A continous. Cells can give 80A burst for few seconds, for continous use i would stay around 30Amps(~700W).

To summarise:
Pack of 48 sanyo ga cells 6s8p
bms 60A (with balancing led)

What do you guys think? Everything I've read so far says that's not what everyone else does... But I don't know how to revert back to him in a technical enough way (want to avoid sounding like a spoilt kid)...  Or is the suggestion cool?

If i were you , i would go 10S 5P (50cells) with the sanyo GA cells . Higher voltage =better for electronics and higher speed. 

5 in parallel will give you 50 amps continous power if needed.

Well you can consult other ppl here.. and 80A is more than enough for continous power I think.. you can contact @whitepony to find out at what speed / power he managed to ''break the barrier'' and reach close to that amp draw..

10S5P seems like a good solution... you will still get around 15+ah (at ~3200 mah for sanyo)

50GAs is probably ok with 1 vesc - overall you should check how fast you want to run on average, how flat your hood is and how hard you want to ride your board.

I managed to warm up my 10S4P HG2 with excessive full throttle, full braking hard riding. if i keep constant velocity with 30-40kph riding speed it stays cool.

The trouble with HG2 cells is they are more tightly wound and the coulombic efficiency will decrease more rapidly than a similar cell with a lower capacity like the HE4 or HE2. This is only a problem if driving the cells hard in a small pack, if you were to use the HG2 in a very large pack the cells would not be stressed hard enough to cause much plating.

What cells do you recommend @chaka? I wouldn't like to go something like 2500mah like the 25R because of the lower range, how drastically do you think the loss of capacity would be in the HG2/30Q? If in 2 years, maybe 400 cycles, i can go the 25km of my daily commute that's ok, by this time i hope better cells will have hit the market
```

## \#42 Posted by: chaka Posted at: 2016-08-26T03:59:06.825Z Reads: 324

```
Coulombic efficiency is a measurement of how much power you charge the cells vs how much you are able to discharge. Ideally this would be a 1:1 ratio but as a pack ages the amount of power you can draw begins to drop. Tighter cells experience more plating vs the lower capacity cells and will have a lower cycle life in comparison if pushed hard. 

@Pedrodemio I like the HE4 cells but they are nearly identical to HE2's. If you go big you can play with HG2's becuase the pack will not get hot like they do in 10s3p and 10s4p configurations.

Try to remember all my recommendations come from riding at 35mph. An average rider may never heat a pack up as much if riding at 20mph.

I recommend going as big as physically possible. I personally do not recommend going less than 60 cells, this keeps voltage sag to a min and heat is never a problem. Heat is what kills packs over time.

A 12s4p pack will be under a lot of load if geared to hit 35mph so I would go with a 2500 mAh cell vs high capacity since they will get hot on hills or frequent accelerations and a high capacity cell will be more susceptible to plating.

Another factor not discussed much is you want a pack that can do 35 miles if you plan to do regular 20 mile runs. The reason for this is you do not want to deplete your pack all the way down to 3.3v per cell every time you ride. Heat starts to peak rapidly when you cross the 3.3v "cliff"

Should be fine as long as you don't try and break some speed records. ;)

One reason a favor a digital voltage readout vs a "fuel gauge" is you can see how much your voltage is dropping when you hammer the throttle. If the voltage is sagging severely then you know that you should ease up on the throttle to keep the cells in good health. It is very important on smaller packs to keep an eye on things like this. 

Again, I have to keep reminding people, my methods are based on very aggressive riding. What works for most people does not work for me.

@chaka are you sure about these internal resistance numbers? Looking at the data sheet the 30Q is slight lower, but I think the difference is negligible 

HG2:

30Q:

http://www.nkon.nl/sk/k/30q.pdf

My ridding conditions are less severe than yours, geared to 35 km/h and most of the way flat, but I have one or two "hills" of 11% and maybe 100m or so that if I'm on a lower state of charge the board struggle and loses a lot of speed
In my calculations, while I this situation (20A battery limit / 37 V / 0,36 ohms IR) i'm loosing 200w of power in heating the battery, not good, and only 500w actually going to the VESC/Motor

```
The reference I gave above was from my notes, the 30Q was only about 5 milliohms higher then the LG cells when I had tested them. A lot of builders do not realize that pushing these cells hard produces some very high temperatures and the tighter the cells are wound the more they will suffer from plating when hot. 

I have been studying the discharge profiles of everything available for a long time and I came to the conclusion a long time ago that we should aim for a 5 amp per cell "max constant discharge" to have a healthy long lasting battery system in the 18650 format. This chart gives a good representation on why this is important.

In my opinion there is no such thing as burst current in electric vehicles. Everything we do is sustained long enough to be considered constant. Hill climbing and braking to be the times when we abuse our packs the most. These are the scenarios you should be designing for.

Totally agree with your 5A max logic, minimum sag = minimal heat = minimal degradation

Unfortunately some compromises have to be made, for a lightweight commuter is simply not possible to reach this 5A per cell while still maintaining a decent performance

I see a lot of people using the maximum discharge rate of the battery as the current limit, maybe if each one find what's the lowest current limit that still maintain a satisfactory performance we can have batteries that last a little longer

@Chaka

You seem to have great knowledge of batteries. Could you summarise these things:

What voltage sag would be ''allowable''? Do you only look at the ''lower end'' of the battery's voltage spectrum or you start to look already at fully charged battery? 

What I meant is - Should it be important to watch out not to let the voltage sag under 2.7 when underload (which would probably mean batt's voltage is at 3.0 or so... 

or that, for fully charged battery the sag should not be more than 0.5 volt, which would mean around 3.6/3.7 when underload max.. 

----

I hope you catch my point - what would be your recommended max voltage sag (for charged battery and for the ''low end'', too) ?

---
I do remember you said that battery should not be let under 3.3 volts..(for longevity purpose, as under 3.0 volts it's been said there's very little ''juice'' in the battery.. and you just do more harm than good by taking these last drops of energy out..

I recall seeing his recommendation having at least 60 cells in a pack. At 10s6p this provies 120A of discharge current for most esk8 18650 cells. You'll likely never discharge continuously at 120A but that extra buffer leads to lower voltage sag.

At 3.3v the cells are on the edge of a voltage "cliff" so to speak. Below 3.3v resistance builds considerable and they get hot so I set my VESC "Battery cutoff start" at the equivalent of 3.3v per cell (10s / 33v) and the cutoff end at 3.0v per cell.

The higher the amperage draw per cell the high the voltage sag. This means you will be able to pull more mAh from cells that are being discharged at a lower rate before hitting the 3.3v threshold. If you are following what I am saying you will see that doubling the size of your pack will actually provide more than double your usable range.

We need to remember that the factory specs on these cells is assuming you are discharging to 2.5v per cell. A 3000mAh cell will only yield around 2000 mAh when discharged at 5 amps constant. Interestingly an HE4  2500 mAh cell yields only 200mAh's less under the same load.

The LG HD2 is actually similar in capacity at higher discharge rates and has more capacity when pushed to it's 25 amp max constant current.

I need to test it to be sure, but like I said, on paper it out performs the rest at high discharge. Of course this type of use would degrade the pack much faster than in a very large pack but in a racing scenario it may be a very good contender.

If we are talking about smaller packs that will see higher temperatures, then yes the lower capacity cells will have a longer cycle life. 

I know it seems counter intuitive, we all want to use the highest capacity cells in a smaller pack to maximize our range but it isn't a healthy choice for the cells because of the higher average discharge rates.

But there are so many variables at play.... You can reduce your gear ratio so you will not pull many amps and safely use the high capacity cells in a smaller format because your average amp draw will be very low. My area of experience just happens to be in boards geared to top out at 35mph so take my advice from that frame of view.

At 10s8p you can really use just about any cell but it is still a good idea to use a high discharge cell because it allows you to crank up your braking currents if you need it without cooking the cells. 

@Randy On a single drive yes, but only when sustaining that level of output during climbing or into a heavy headwind at high speed. A dual drive can do it all day.... within reason. Too large of a motor on really tall gearing would probably heat up a set of VESC's too.

One reason a favor a digital voltage readout vs a "fuel gauge" is you can see how much your voltage is dropping when you hammer the throttle

That's one of the reasons I like my voltage meter setup. I knew the HE2 cells I'm using sagged, but now I can see it. They sag .4 of a volt on flat, and as much as 1.2 volts on hills on my 4wd board. But with a 10s4p, the sag is a non issue. The sag was extremely annoying when I used these cells in a 10s3p pack with dual drives (same hubs as backs of 4wd board).

This is my issue constantly. Other than riding aggressively, I ride on steep hills that require a lot of torque. I was able to climb a 27% grade hill today and still maintain some fair speed for what my board can do. But I still need higher top speeds, I sit a lot at full throttle and generally feel slow, even though I top off around 24 mph.

 I suppose I should have stated "electrolytes of higher density". ;)  I can't remember where I found it but I have seen some test results where 2900mah density was the sweet spot at 1C. May have been a tesla related paper.

Aside from differences in cells one major contributer of cell life degradation is charging to 4.2v per cell every time you charge your pack. It is best to only charge to 4.15 the majority of time and charge to 4.2 periodically to balance the pack when needed or on some sort of maintenance cycle. Having a very large pack makes the loss of range a non issue since your the capacity is so high.

Their are many different aspects of li-ion cell management that play into overall cycle life.

I've got a 10s4p with 25Rs. Definitely very solid. If the HG2's were slightly cheaper I would have probably gone for them.

I've looked at what the vaping community has done in researching cells. They look at voltage sag, temperature changes, and a slew of other things, all at varying discharge currents. Here's links to the [list of a lot of the cells they've tested](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/blog-entry/list-of-battery-tests.7436/), and the [HE2](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/lg-he2-20a-2500mah-18650-bench-retest-results-a-very-good-20a-battery.716469/), [HE4](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/lg-he4-20a-2500mah-18650-bench-retest-results-a-good-20a-battery-but-25r5-is-better.732241/), and [HG2](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/lg-hg2-20a-3000mah-18650-bench-retest-results-a-great-20a-battery.714112/) specifically.

HE2 = a very good 20A battery
HE4 = a good 20A battery but 25R5 is better
HG2 = a great 20A battery!

High heat will deform the surface of the cathode/anode which will decrease the capacitance of the cell. It's certainly possible to solder, but you need a high power iron in order to get the job done as quick as possible. A less powerful iron will need to stay on the cell for too long which will cause damage to the internals of the cell.

yeah, better get someone to weld it for you.. soldering (even with tabs on).. is a pain in the A##..

I also used tinned braid wire (flat).. it got so hot quickly  that I started to worry about the cells.. I think someone suggested using towel or some other methods to cool everything down, though Im not so sure, perhaps it was an idea to use towel if you were using heat gun or something..

--

It will be quite hard.. almost impossible in some cases.. to make decent / strong solder points directly onto the cell.. at least I tried it a few times.. but the job did not look very nice.. I did not test the connections though but it just looked ugly :D

There's a second method discussed - use little ''fuse wires'', then connect these to the ''bus'' rail. Check some other threads ''cell level fuse'' to see how it might work. Did not try it though but it is a lot more wise / easier to do than solder fat 12awg cables to each cell I think..

My high heat iron did a pretty good job soldering the cells to my wire. Much easier to solder wire to the cell vs tabs IMO. See below.

Thanks @Jinra and @Okami  

So is spot welding what makes building a Li-ion packs pretty expensive, as far as I could tell the batteries, BMS and other parts needed for the build seem relatively cheap.

Well cells will still be the bulk of the cost. You can get a decent spot welder for $100-200 so it's a bit of an investment, but you can build a ton of packs with it!

I'm very interested in building my own pack, but I don't think buying a spot welder to use just one time is worth it for me. 

Might be a dumb question but do you think hot glue would do the job? :sweat_smile: 

Glue the contacts and heat shrink the whole thing so it stays in place.

Definitely not. The glue would probably melt and lose contact after a while due to the vibrations. It *may* work with a sled, but you'll have to solder support tabs because the sleds won't handle much current. The plastic of the sled may melt too depending on the pack and conditions.

Ive made only one pack so far but yeah soldering with 60w iron was not that easy. It did melt the solder quite quick, i think the problem was that i did not think hard enough how to hold the tabs in place where i want to solder them.

U can try to find cells with tabs welded onto them already. One option is to buy power tool batteries which have tabs soldered. Though you will pay extra for the brand, casing and perhaps bms which you dont need

Thanks for the input!
I've got a 100w soldering iron, I'm gonna try it out on a few cells. If its too hot i'll find someone to spot weld it. 

I think i'm going to go for the Samsung 25r cells (to make a 8s3p or 8s4p) as they've got great reviews here. The only thing I am unsure of is the Samsung 25R shows that it only has a 20A continuous discharge current. My motor has a max of 82A , 3000W. From what I have read so far an "#s4p" pack would multiply the 20A max output of the cell to 80A, is this correct ?

Also if the motor demands more current, that could be limited by a VESC right, I could just limit it to draw 80a?

Hah im already trying to figure out battery's max amps while it is mounted to a mountainboard.. would love to see what are the max rating my battery is capable of, if you did not check the other thread, my ''system'' reach about 60A / 1200watts, that is 6s, when I tried to push hard at direct wind.

@chaka Would a 10S2P pack (Sony VTC5 30A cells) be okay paired up with one of your 5065-200kv motors? Or would current draw be too high? I'm trying to keep weight to a minimum and anything above 10S2P is just too bulky.

An alternative would be building a 12S1P 26650 LiFe pack, identical to that used in the Boosted. Although range would be quite poor.

Thanks!

They would work but they still are capable of drawing over 2000 watts if you let them. Be sure you choose a low gear ratio if you want low current draw on that pack.

Not entirely related to choosing 18650 batteries, though somewhat highly imformative relating to Lithium batteries in general!

Next step in the process of increasing energy density is to go with Lithium Metal batteries (so they say).. though they have to overcome the phenomen of why dendrites ''grow'' inside of cells - thus decreasing their lifespan (and capacity) and also.. in extreme cases.. causing shorts inside of battery..

Here's the video btw!

Is this confirmed or are they just really hard to get?  I am just curious as I hear they were never intended to get out on the cell market in a broad sense and were intended only for oem scenarios. I have a line on some VTC5a cells (genuine) but I wonder if this will be the last of the stock?

I am building a e-longboard, did a lot of reading past weeks and i have a basic knowledge of electronics. But still i am having some questions.
my basic electrical setup/important parts is:
100A on/off switch with key
volt and amp meter LCD display 100A DC.
turnigy sk3 236Kv (60A max).
Hobbywing ESC HV(12S max) 100A + cooling fan
Yuneec ego 7S3P battery 18650 pack (with build in standard BMS).
13T small pulley, 35T big pulley, 5m timing belt.
GT2E reciever and controller.
UBEC xxV->6V 7A (for reciever)
on a Loaded Vanguard or Yuneec Downhill Board 

Now will this setup work? I calculated max speed, diameter of wheels, pulleys,.. and stuff..thats all OK
but will it electrically work... wont i burn something up? Did i select the right hardware?

My ESC can handle my Motor current... 
but can my ego battery 7S3P 18650's with build in BMS handle that current? (no specs on the standerd BMS used by ego)
Can i change the BMS with some diysoldering and keep my 7S3P battery pack, or do i need another battery?
What kind of BMS should i use? or just a battery pack without BMS and so without limitations..
Lipo istead of Li-ion18650's? new lipo= Expensive :sweat:

I'll take pics during the building process, so you all can see the progress and the finished result.
Someone can help me? So i dont burn up some parts?
All advice welcome. 
Thanks co-diy'ers

Has anyone considered using Samsung INR18650-15L cells? I realize the capacity stinks, however they're extremely inexpensive if you're willing to tear them out of brand new tool packs.

If my math is correct (1500mAh @ nominal 3.6V), a 10S4P would end up being 216Wh, and a 10S5P would be 270Wh.

My minimum target range is 22km (flat). Not quite sure the 10S4P could accomplish this.

I am thinking of making a 7s6p pack for my first build and was thinking of getting 25Rs (with nickel soldering strips) from Nkon but on looking through other cells have found larger capacity cells for cheaper! I will put the cell links at the bottom and would like feedback on whether I should just stick to the 25Rs, bearing in mind that I was going to limit the max current to 45A anyway so the extra current of the 25Rs will be uselss. That being said, I know from experience with Lipos that you should never run a battery at the limits of its specification unless you don't mind changing your whole battery pack every day!

The two batteries (https://eu.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/panasonic-ncr18650pf-3-7v-2900mah.html) and (https://eu.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/samsung-inr18650-29e.html).

Both of those cells have quite low discharge currents, even for a 6p setup. I personally recommend aiming to only use about 1/2 the max current of a given cell's "output rating" (definitely true for the 25R's, possibly less true for some other cells). So I'd recommend only using 10A from a single 25R (so 4 in parallel would give you 40A).

Many thanks, will stick to 6p (using the 25Rs) because then I can get a cheaper deal on batteries :slight_smile: ). It also means I will discharge the board less with each ride - the cells will last longer.

The HG2 can do 20A continious. If you are going for a 9Ah pack, you will need these cells in a 3p configuration. 20A x 3 =60A. As you will be running a 8s setup (28,8v), you will have a max countinious power of 1700w. 28,8 x 60 = 1728. It will be enough for the bike to work of course, but it won't be crazy fast
