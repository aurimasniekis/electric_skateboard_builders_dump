Hi guys

I think I may have made a mistake.

I've got a Trampa all terrain board with ideas motor mount. 15t and 72t. Focbox unity is awaiting delivery.

I ordered some motors and they have just arrived but I am now wondering if they are correct for the battery I want.

The motors are two of the hobbyking sk8 190kv and the battery I want is 12s4p. Is there any issues with using these together? Slow speed etc?

You will fly like a rocket.
All good!
Torque would be better with lower kV but as long as you donâ€™t plan crazy off road sessions all is good

Cheers. Massive loss in torque or you think they will be fine for offroading?

I have also a mount from idea & unity. I have ordered a 170kv motor. I think 192kv is to high on 12s? check it to be sure :wink:

Your 190kV is probably anyhow more like 180 or 200kV... you have a good gearing. Should work for your needs. If you have too less torque than just by a smaller motor pulley and you good.

Just don't hit the brakes going downhill on a full battery.

Actually I think you will have lots of voltage sag with a 4p battery for use on a mountain board.
