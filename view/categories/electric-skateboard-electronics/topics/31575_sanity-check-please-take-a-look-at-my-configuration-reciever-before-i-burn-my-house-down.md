**Question #1:**

Just finished my 10S4P battery and looking to get it hooked up with my BMS. It will be bypassed for discharge.

I'm fairly confident that I've got everything set up right, just looking to get that confirmed. Is the BMS wiring correct? Please excuse my mad Paint skillz. Blue = negative wire. Black = balance leads

**Question #2:**

When I bought my 2.4ghz Nunchuck I got [this reciever with it.](http://www.ebay.com/itm/NRF24L01-PA-LNA-SMA-Antenna-Wireless-Transceiver-Communication-Arduino-US-Seller-/172051152184?hash=item280f0c3d38:g:JnIAAOSwFqJWixLf) I found a schematic of the layout, pictured below, but can't seem to figure out which of the pins on the VESC is for 5V and which is for the signal.

I'm guessing the "GND" goes to "GND"(marked with blue "X") on the VESC, but I don't know about the other two.

 Do I need to bind it with the nunchuck in any way?
