i think i must of stuffed something up but when I connect my two 3s batteries in series and then i connected the two balance leads with the 2 3s to 6s charging harness I plug the positive and negative into the charger and after I plug the balance lead in the charger starts to smoke anyone know why it would be doing this?

Same thing happened to me. I bought imax 6 charger from hobbyking. I plugged 2x3s in series with hobbyking's adapter plugged it in to charger. At third charging it burned 4th cell's components (resistors?).
Pcb was ruined so I threw it away.

I bought new cheap 3s charger, because it was almost winter and right now I'm upgrading to 10s.

I think that I plugged balance leads wrong way, I mean cells 123 to 456 and 456 to 123.

connect your balance leads the other way (correct way) and there wont be a problem. but you will need a new (or repaired) charger

I had the same problem - you probably just plugged the +/- leads and the balance leads in a  switch configuration. Either way - and I can not emphasize this enough - don't use Lipos. I never had anything but problems with them. They're less stable, more prone to fires, and they don't last as long. If you want a better experience, get a Lithium Ion or LiFePO battery.

I've been using lipos across 4 boards, no issues at all.  They just require that you know what your doing...don't rush through the connection & charging process and you too can ride without voltage sag.
