Hey everyone. I have a duel vesc board with a Noka Kama controller. I never used the z button for reverse but I use the c button all the time for cruise control. Is there any way of programming the Z button for anything different such as turning on headlights?  Thanks

I seem to remember code already being in the VESC for head/stoplights.
Vedder has them in a video somewhere. Dunno about the z-button though. That might require custom code in the VESC.

Yea. I saw the video too. Interesting concept. I'll have to dig a little deeper on programming the z button.
