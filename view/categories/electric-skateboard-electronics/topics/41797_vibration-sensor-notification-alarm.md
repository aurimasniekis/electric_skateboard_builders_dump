I was looking for an alarm that instead of sounding a loud alarm when moved, would notify a receiver on the user's end. I came across this product on [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Two-Way-Motorcycle-Alarm-Security-System-Motorbike-2-Way-Alarm-Keyless-Entry-Anti-theft-Vibration/32787690974.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.F1IBmQ). 
However, it requires power from a motorcycle and has an alarm. I'm planning on not attaching the alarm, and splicing some wires to hook up the device onto a 12 volt battery. 
Has anyone seen an alarm like this before? Does anyone have any idea what wires provide power to the device?
