Hello All,

Quick question...Has anyone had an issue with the Multiple VESC window not appearing when running setup on the new VESC Tool?

Currently helping a friend set up his board, and following along with most recent guides. They all say this window should pop up and allow you to choose between master and slave VESC setup. However, this prompt never appears. The software seems to recognize that there are two connected, but does not ask to change ID or select between Master and Slave. 

Any ideas? Are we missing something simple? Is the prompt no longer in the newest versions?

Thanks for any advice you can offer.
