One of my to VESC gave out on me today when I was barely moving at about 2mph riding next to my kids on their scooters.  

After further inspection, the only thing that looked off was that 2 sets of legs on the drive chip were soldered together.  I havent done any soldering on the vesc and still has shrink wrap intact. 

Hasn’t anyone ever seen this?  Is there’s a reason that these legs are tied together?  

I’m guessing that this could/would cause the issue?

These are perfectly normal...

If you try it on the bench can you see a red led flashing tree time.

Thanks for this @JohnnyMeduse.  Yes it flashes three times when I give it throttle.  The only reason why I thought it was odd is because I didn't notice it on the other VESCs
