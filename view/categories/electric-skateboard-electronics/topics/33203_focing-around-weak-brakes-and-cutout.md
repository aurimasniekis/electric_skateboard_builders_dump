Hey all,

With the release of vesc tool and 3.28 I decided to try FOC. setup was a bit buggy as i got failed detections and the "r is 0" bug, but i was eventually able to get everything setup. I copied my current limits from bldc on 2.18, but had a couple issues in my first ride. Here's my setup...

10s4p Samsung 25R
Each VESC (dual Ollin 4.12 setup):
motor max: 70
motor min: -70
battery max: 40
battery min: -8
FOC sensored

The problem:

1. The brakes are noticeably weaker than bldc while startup is about the same strength. There is a slight delay when accelerating and braking as well but i chalked this up to FOC limitations. I've already decreased ramp up time to .1s

2. When i blast the throttle from standstill (unloaded) or quickly speed up going uphill (or I assume anytime I'm drawing a lot of current), The Vescs cutout and the wheels stop spinning until i let go and throttle again. The behavior is as if I'm getting over current, which i may very well be, but not sure why this happens in FOC and not BLDC. Haven't checked error codes yet, but I'm assuming over current, will update later.

The board otherwise works fine with smooth startup and no issues running at 50k erpm. Any input is appreciated!

FOC is sensitive to sudden acceleration, mine cuts out at 0-100% throttle momentarily, It some times lose pole detection, also momentary, but sensored shouldn't do that
but if its over current u can increase absolute max up to 150a safely, though I only goes 140a.
accelerating ramping u can just kill it with 0s, but I saw people complaining even after that. I haven't try so..

Sensored shouldn't have much to do with it given that it moves over to sensorless at about 3mph (7000eRPM). If I am getting over current faults I'll check tonight to see how much current I'm drawing.

If the full throttle cutouts are something i "just have to live with" then I'll probably switch back to BLDC.

I will miss the quietness and battery efficency though, I ended up with like 4-5% more battery at the end of my 3.7 mile ride.

Strangely my case was opposite to you XD
I had over current in BLDC in braking and Switched to FOC,
Efficiency only noticeable over 10miles I think, I get 3 miles more over BLDC

I have similar issue, but only cuts out when braking. Even if i brake and try to push the board with my feet, the vesc resets.

@Sebike easily fixable by increasing max input voltage, not sure why Enertion would mess with this setting though.

Welp, just ran a block and hit 148 amp OC fault one VESC and none on the other. Only once in the 2 minute ride, however.  Perhaps 150-160 would be a better setting.

As for the braking, 40% polynomial did not help, simpy made the braking more unpredictable.

I never had this error on prior build that was using mt60 from motor to vesc. On this one I continued with the connectors that came on the motor which were the 5mm bullet with the springy part on the male side. I *think* those springy bullets might be at fault

@Jinra ... Tips... The new firmware is still a experimental thing... I've try it and from personal experience I really don't like it, because the brake are not really nice, it like they are fully on then disappear.... still the best firmware is @Ackmaniac (still using it in current... but ... I'm not dead yet)

I have the opposite experience, where they're fairly weak, then as I approach PPM min, it brakes harder.

The problem with ackmaniac's f/w was that FOC wouldn't run at all. Detection would work, but throttling to around 80% duty cycle caused the motor to cog and spaz out.

I'm 99% sure I narrowed it down to a springy bullet connector, 1 of the 3 phase leads if I rattle it aggressively I can hear the ticks and then over current fault
@Jinra try it on the bench, full throttle, secure 2 leads and abuse one like you're going over tough terrain, go through each
I'm switching everything to mt60 tomorrow

Do your setup without belts to get best accuracy. Do it at system voltage! Use 50A max to get started. Increase step by step.
Weak brakes are a matter of your battery min.
I suggest to use the same values for motor max, battery max, and motor min, battery min. Then you can start to spread the values further apart.

already did all that, and like i said, this setup and settings was working great on bldc 2.18. it only started having problems after transitioning to FOC 3.28

Also, why is the default value for battery regen -40? Seems excessively high.

30-40A is about the current that will flow when you brake hard. You need to shoot it somewhere and that's your battery. Whenever you brake you generate. Usually you don't do that continuously, so its not to much of an issue to use higher values. 
It's happens only for a few seconds.

honestly anecdotal evidence doesn't really matter. The point is that -40a current on a setup like 3p 18650 sounds dangerous. That setup can only accept 12a continuous.

I do get that that's the maximum current it can have and should only apply when you hit regen speeds, but it still sounds sketchy.

I don't understand why the brakes are so different from 2.18 to 3.28 on the same settings

```
When your motor acts as a generator, braking your board, it generates electricity and that needs to go somewhere. Either you evaporate it into heat (heat plate) or feed your battery. Going down a long steep hill, constantly braking, you feed the battery and the hill should not be steeper than your battery can cope with. You will roughly pump the same amount of energy into the battery than what you would use to go up the hill minus the losses you have when you shift kinetic energy into electric energy. Battery min. defines your maximum braking force, same like battery max. defines you maximum system power.

Shouldn't Motor min determine your max braking force given that battery min always has to be lower?

I just don't see why the change was made between the old and new f/w? It worked great on 2.18

```
Conservation of energy..... The energy needs to go somewhere. Either into heat, using a strong electric heater attached under your board, or you shift the energy towards your battery. It needs to go somewhere. If one value is lower than the other, the software uses the lower of both values to protect your system. You can't evaporate energy into the universe. Conservation of energy...

It's the same for acceleration. If you only allow 8amps from the battery, increasing your motor max to 100A will not increase the boards absolute performance. The lower value defines your max output power, since we can't suck energy from the universe.

[/quote]

Sure would. This whole regenerative braking is always creating more questions than answers.
I actually thought the difference would be dissipated 'somewhere' in the VESC and not the motor. But who can tell for sure? Maybe it's time to ask the questions about it on vesc-project.com forum? :)

```
The VESC converts the voltage of the battery to the right amount of voltage for the motor. This is the duty cycle.
So when the vesc works at 10% duty cycle then the motor runs at 10% of the batterys voltage. At the same time the battery only has to provide 10% of the motors current.

    10% duty cycle
    Battery 40V   4A
    Motor    4V  40A

At 90% duty cycle the motor runs at 90% of the batterys voltage and the battery only has to provide 90% of the motor current.

    90% duty cycle
    Battery 40V  36A
    Motor   36V  40A

Now braking works exactly the same. Only the power is going in the other direction but the duty cycle and ratios behave the same.

So when you do a full brake and the duty cycle is at 50% and the motor min is set to -70A and battery min to -10A then battery min sets the limit.

    50% duty cycle
    Battery 40V  35A
    Motor   20V  70A

So in this case you would exceed the limit of -10A amps by far. So the VESC reduces the brake power to -10A at the battery which results at 50% duty cylce to -20A at the motor.

And when the speed goes down the duty cycle becomes lower and so the ratio changes and the VESC is allowed to use more and more amps at the motor side for braking.
So the maximum brake power is allowed at duty cycles below  14A (10A / 70A).

So the higher you set your battery min the stronger the brakes will be at high speeds.
```

Thanks for the explanation! So basically, if I got it correctly, Motor Min is like brake force parameter that will be adjusted according to the Battery Min and the duty cycle. There is no difference that should be dissipated.

Do you happen to be able to know or explain the voltage VESC puts back at the battery while braking (or how does that work)? It is not a set parameter as far as I can tell..

First off

If your in FOC and hear ticking and are expecting a fault. Your running the motor at the wring Hz. Change to something else. (I think 20000hz is default) go higher. 

Second calculating voltage for what comes in is easy. RPM/kv = V

However...amps will turn into volts if there's no path for the current and can cause over voltage.

Just wanted to report in, my 6374, TB vesc, on 12sp4 battery is running good on FOC, however like others have said brakes are a bit weak, but not terrible. I also found that after climbing a pretty steep hill 25% grade thats decently long the brakes and throttle are fairly anemic for a short time, but return after about 30 seconds.

That is very likely. Your temp soft cuttoff is preventing that you overheat your system any further. Basically you surpassed the limits of your hardware and its time for an upgrade of components, or ride less steep hills. After 30 seconds the temp reaches acceptable values again and your brakes/power come back back to life. At this point you are close to reaching critical values again, so don't attack a hill (riding downhill) because your brakes could fail again and you have no redundant brake system to compensate the loss of your motor brake. This is why I suggest to use disc brakes in addition (on MTBs it's possible) when riding in hilly areas.

Okay good to know! I thought I had pretty good components already. TB 6374 Motor, TB VESC and TB 12s4p battery. Which components would you consider an upgrade? The board is street only, not a MTB, so disc brakes dont really seem to be an option or something I really want. My area definitely isn't as hilly as say San Fransisco or anything like that. Thanks in advance!

So i guess the weather brakes issue has been addressed, but does anyone know why i get over current faults on high load? Mainly happens when i accelerate too quickly. Today one of my motors also cutout and was in perma brake mode, but resolved itself after a restart. Is this a sign of a burnt drv?

Okay so I switched back to FOC and also made some current changes to my setup and it seems to have helped somewhat with my vesc overheating issue when going up hills. I also played with the throttle/brake curve a bit and that also seems to have given me a little more brake at speed. Having adjusted the expo brake curve has made the brakes a bit more responsive when I'm at speed while decreasing the amount of brake I have while going slower. It's still not great but it does feel better. Here are some screen shots for reference.

@scepterr @JohnnyMeduse @Blasto

Figured out why I was getting OC faults while blasting the throttle. This is precisely what the positive/negative ramping time in PPM is. with a sudden increase in current, the VESC pulls too much too fast due to the abrupt PPM signal change. Using a positive ramping time will give it some breathing room to gradually bring up the current to the requested levels without causing a huge spike.

I'm finding .2s to be satisfactory in relieving OC faults on the bench. Will test in the field tomorrow.

Upgraded, dual ollinboards VESC

Oh @scepterr, I went back to FOC on 2.54 and I noticed something strange. After setting it up and detection, I found that I can ramp to full duty cycle at about 30% throttle, but anything after that makes the motor spin at a lower pitch sound, like there's resistance or something. This doesn't happen on 3.29 so I think i'll stick on the newer f/w; I feel like I'm going to blow a DRV with that sound.

For the OC issue on 3.28/3.29 yes, for the weird change in pitch, no... 

I tried FOC once before on 2.54, but I forgot which of the Ollin VESCs I used, at high eRPM the motor would cog and spaz the fuck out so I was really afraid to try again. This time it didn't cog, but made a disconcerting lower pitch whine.

Sorry should've taken a vid.

I'm working on my Carvon V3 with a Raptor 1 deck. These are my last two changes, (80 Motor max was recommended by Carvon). In the first setting I was getting cogging when I pushed the throttle too hard so I messed with it and got the the second settings which got rid of the cogging but now I have weak brakes that won't even stop me. Any idea of what I need to change to get brakes back but not have cogging?

I'm using a 10s3p battery with vesc-x

@scepterr @Eboosted  Ugh one issue solved, another arises. Now when I'm going a certain duty cycle and apply more throttle on a slight/moderate incline, the board stutters for a second like it's out of sync. I'm assuming this only happens uphill since downhill doesn't apply much current.

Any ideas guys? I'll try to get a fault reading later

Motor detection is best with battery that will be used....but typically that would be done with a full battery, while actual use will be at nominal voltage at least 70% of the time. Detection results do vary with voltage....so would it be best to do detection with battery at nominal voltage?

It's been good! I had a wipe out that gave me a concussion, but that turned out to be a mixture of a shorted motor and a bad VESC. After replacing both motor and VESC, I've been cautious while riding, but haven't encountered anything weird yet and no faults have been thrown. 

The official Vedder f/w 3.3 has this stated in the change log.

>=== FW 3.30 ===
* Activated iterative observer for better operation at high ERPM.
* Check for NAN and truncate some FOC variables.
* Speed controller windup protection improvement

Not sure if this means that I no longer have to double the observer gain, but I'll hold off on updating for now.
