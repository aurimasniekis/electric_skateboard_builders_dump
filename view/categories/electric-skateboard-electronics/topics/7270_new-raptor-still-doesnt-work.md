Where are you from? What doesn't it do? Can you post pictures from your receiver to vesc with the power on? You should find 3V and 5V on the receiver contacts while connected. Without the remote binded there should be a still red led on the receiver corner. If it's binded it should blink while connected

Did you bind it correctly?

Just follow these Steps if not, they also apply for rebinding a new receiver:
