Hello all,

I haven't had this issue before with my PCBs.
Vedders gerber files include an empty .gbs file (bottom solder mask)

https://github.com/vedderb/SparkSwitch

JLCPBC is telling me its missing that solder mask.

I can't actually find pictures of the bottom of these switches. is there any solder mask for the bottom?

Vedder AntiSpark design has flaws. you should look for something else reliable.

technical stuff: it has no precharge circuit so the FET can easily fail close.

yeah I was going to get the DZ switch made, but I already have the parts for the Vedder. figured for 2$ i may as well order the PCBs

Edit, Ill probably just order the parts and PCBs for the DZ switch.Unfortunately I cant find the Attiny on LCsC.com. @deltazeta where did you order? Mouser is kind expensive.

im testing the DZ switch atm. without load it's working perfectly. I will put it on a build next week to make sure it doesn't blow under high load/current.

I did mouser unfortunately, but arrow might be cheaper.
