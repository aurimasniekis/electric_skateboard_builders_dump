I'm Trying to navigate the vast sea of avalible Brushless Outrunners out there, but having little to no idea what I'm looking for these are my current Options:

Alien 6374 Outrunner brushless motor 170KV 3200W
http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-6374-outrunner-brushless-motor-170kv-3200w/

Alien 5065 Outrunner brushless motor 270KV 2200W
http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-5065-outrunner-brushless-motor-270kv-2200wa/

Enertion 190kv electric skateboard motor 
http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/190kv-electric-skateboard-motor/

The ride will be mostly flat but with some small inclines, the rider + backpack will amount to around 80 Kg, So what should I be looking at in motors for this use? Thanks in advance.

You should skip the alien motors. Go r-spec.
