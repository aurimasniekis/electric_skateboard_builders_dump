I'm looking to make a setup that's at least 10,000 mAh. What should I use? Thoughts?

What voltage, 6s 8s 10s or 12s?

Samsungs are only 2500 mah so you would need 24 cells for a 6s4p to get 10000 mah. 
Basen 26650 are 4500mah so 12 cells for a 6s 2p for 9000mah

Which would be better in terms of performance/safety/longevity though?

In terms of safety/ longevity; 
A123 lifepo 26650 cells
```

Yeah, A123 makes the safest, longest lasting cells that are still high discharge cells. Only downside is that they only hold 2500mAh for 26650 sized cells. Great for shorter range builds unless you have a crap ton of space. 

BTW Boosted Boards use a 12s1p pack of A123 cells.

you forgot that they are also super expensive compared to Samsung 25Rs!!

Not unless you do a group buy :D

~$7 per cell is not bad at all for the some of the best cells around.

I think the A123s are a bit expensive for me haha. Which is the next best one from the list I gave?
```

## \#13 Posted by: Maxid Posted at: 2016-06-30T21:28:01.008Z Reads: 181

```
it is double the samsung for the same mAh - this gets expensive really quick if you go for 20+ cells
Actually in Europe a A123 is more like 9€ while a Samsung sets you back 3.30€ - so three times the money.

Yeah true. I am planning on making two builds with 12s1p packs just for small boards. They fit great on a truncated Tesse and other smaller longboards. 

They are definitely a bad idea for a build focused on range. 

@FrozenFury I would personally make a 10s3p build if I were you. The higher the voltage, the less amps you have to draw to make the same wattage. I forget how much the raptor goes but it should be plenty of range.

@Pantologist 
10s3p build with which battery? 

Also, I think due to budget constraints I'm gonna have to stick with 6s. I think I'll go 6s3p. I'm aiming more for range, not speed. But what speeds do you think it would be able to get? Also which battery would you recommend for such a setup?  I was thinking this [one](http://liionwholesale.com/products/efest-imr-26650-5200mah-15a-40a-imr-flat-top-battery?variant=5669030660). Is it safe/reliable? It says it's 15A. At what speed could that go?

Samsung 25Rs. 

What is your budget? I'm not sure what wheels/pulleys you are using but use this calculator to estimate. http://toddy616.blogspot.com/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html

Those batteries look alright but I haven't heard about that company. The reseller states that they are not in production anymore btw. They won't be coming back instock.

You could get a pulley made for specific wheels. Enertion has one for Flywheel/Flywheel clones. http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/36t-12mm-enertion-drive-hub/. DIY has Flywheel and Kegel compatible ones. category/electric-skateboard-parts/pulleys-belts/

If you're interested, I may be selling a brand new orangatang Kegel wheel set with 2 pulleys already attached.

Also, your motor pulley has a 6mm bore while your motor has a 8mm shaft. So that won't work unless you bore out the pulley to 8mm.

I had a similar post in another thread, but I wanted to add more detail and create a dedicated discussion thread.

I want to choose a battery setup under $100. I care more for distance than speed - 20mph max is good enough for me. I want at least 10,000mAh. What setup should I use? 

[MNKE 26650](http://liionwholesale.com/collections/batteries/products/mnke-26650-3500mah-30a-battery-flat-top-wholesale-discount) vs [BASEN IMR 26650](http://liionwholesale.com/products/basen-4500mah-26650?variant=14135870212) vs [EFEST IMR 26650](http://liionwholesale.com/products/efest-imr-26650-5200mah-15a-40a-imr-flat-top-battery) vs [MNKE IMR 26650](https://batterybro.com/products/mnke-imr-26650) vs [Samsung 25R5](https://batterybro.com/products/samsung-25r5-green-inr1865025r5-2500mah-20a)

Also, I have no clue how to charge these batteries. I want to charge them with [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GQZLBGY/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=2ZVCBZILZEJPY&coliid=IB19Q4AI627SU), is that possible?

I also want to get a BMS. Would [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Protection-Balance-Module-BMS-PCM-12A-for-6S-22-2V-Li-ion-Li-Po-battery-6S12W003-/321790732770) one work?

Lastly I did harvest some Samsung 25R5's from old laptop batteries. They seem to be different models however. Would it be possible to combine them with other brands or with newer 25R5's?

If you don't want to play any guessing games with part compatibility, get stuff from DIYelectricskateboard, enertion, ollin, miami electricboards, or another esk8 shop.

The parts are the motor pulley and the motor on the list. Most common bore size is 8mm, so as long as the motor shaft is 8mm and the motor pulley has a 8mm bore, you should be set.

[/quote]
With 6s, you'll need 10000 mah to go 10-12 miles
6s is very smooth and easy to control. 
With 12s, 10000 mah should get you 20 miles but it's much faster with jerky acceleration so it's harder to control.

For the cells, go for big known brands (LG,Sony, Samsung, etc.).
Smaller brands like EFEST or Trustfire etc. are just repackaged cells that didn't meet the criteria to be sold with the big brand name on them.

If I were you, I'd go for the samsung 25 (good price/mah).
But since I'm not you, I'd go for the LG 18650HG2, a bit pricier but I had very good experiences with them in my vaping gear.

I think the Basen 26650 li-ions are fairly economical because there less than $8 ea.  And there 4500mah so you only need half as many. And there rated at 40amp continuous although some have claimed that they are good for 25 amp cont. Still better than 25r. 
And if you make a 2p pack, you've got 9000mah and 50amp continuous draw.

How many miles would that be able to go and at what speed in a 6s2p setup?
```

---
## \#27 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2016-06-30T22:58:30.820Z Reads: 141

Depends on motor KV, gear ratio, rider weight. 
Here's an example:
Rider weight 185lbs
Motor 230kv
Gearing 16/36
6s2p  battery
Top speed around 15 mph on flat ground
Range would be apx. 10 miles
```

## \#29 Posted by: Pantologist Posted at: 2016-06-30T23:24:06.168Z Reads: 138

The highest Amp rating one, 60A. You have less volts and you will be pulling more current to get the same wattage.
```

---
## \#30 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2016-06-30T23:56:18.760Z Reads: 132

I would also recommend the 60amp and its a good idea to put a 40a or 50a inline fuse between the bms output and the ESC.

[quote="Namasaki, post:30, topic:5390"]
50a inline fuse
[/quote]

Where would I find one of those? Is [this](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Inline-Circuit-Breaker-Protection/dp/B00FNU9BQG) it?

Also if I got a 8s, 10s, or 12s BMS for example, would it be compatible with a 6s build?
