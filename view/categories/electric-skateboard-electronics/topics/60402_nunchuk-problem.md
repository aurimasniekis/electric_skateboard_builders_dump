Well, I admit it was a long time ago, but I've been interested in him recently. I saw you connected in the forum, but I can't connect it. Can you tell me how you connect successfully? I hope you can remember the steps and give me a reply.I'm using V6.

My program was written in, but I don't know if it's right. When I just wrote in, the red light will be bright and the green light doesn't shine. When I press the button, the red light sometimes brightens, sometimes it doesn't shine, and the two buttons press together and the green light will be bright. When I recharged the board, the green and red lights could not be lit again, and the program seemed to be lost. Is it my program that has written the wrong program? My NRF can match VESC successfully, but it can't control throttleMy remote control is like this. Can you give me some advice?
