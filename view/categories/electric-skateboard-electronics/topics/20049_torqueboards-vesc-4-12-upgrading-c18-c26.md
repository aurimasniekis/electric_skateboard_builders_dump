I have 2 TB VESCs that are missing c26, and I'm guessing have 2.2uF caps on c18.
I am about to buy four 4.7uF caps to replace c18 and then place an extra one in c26.
Is there such a thing as too much capacitance? I'm planning on running FOC but want to make sure I'm not making it worse by adding too much capacitance if that is even a thing.

Nah, there is no such thing as too much capacity specially with FOC :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: And you shouldn't had any problem using this setup.

Cool, thanks for the confirmation.
Will install 2 4.7uF caps on each then!

I'm running 2x 10µF on all my VESC's so 2x 4,7µF is totally OK.
