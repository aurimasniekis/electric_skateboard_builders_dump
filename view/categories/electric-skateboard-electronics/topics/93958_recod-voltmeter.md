Hey not the biggest electronics guy - can someone recommend a good percentage voltmeter for a 12s6p Samsung 30Q board? 

Would prefer a white or red display to keep with my boards color scheme. However I can't seem to find any that are 50V only 48V. 

Let me know if you have a best in class option - extra points for a waterproof one. Also if I'm just never going to find a percentage based one for 50V keep me honest.

48v is your nominal voltage, set it to 12s it will read properly to full charge. never seen a red screen only white, green and blue but maybe youll get lucky

I use that one too low cost and works great.  You can switch between % and volts and off and on. Nice for $4

This has legs for sure. I would make one revision, we wear nothing. Or at least give that option for an up-charge.

hey man we could probably charge double if we took it on the road. I can't sell to sperm banks in the US anymore but I hear Asia could be a growth opportunity
