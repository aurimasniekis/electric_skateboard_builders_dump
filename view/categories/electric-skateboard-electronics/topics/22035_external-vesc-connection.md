Ok guys I am finishing up my build and would like to make the usb port on the VESC accessible without removing the enclosure. I have found one option but it is a pretty large rubber coated fitting with a cap. Does anyone know if the mini usb connector on the VESC would electrically charge an adapter plugged into it? My concern would be shorting the external connection that would in turn kill my VESC.

I used [this](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00B3SBTRQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) one and integrated it into my enclosure. Works without any issues.

No issues with water shorting it out?

Not until yet. Maybe you will find a plug or something that will function as a cover.
Alternatively you can use a bluetooth module and change settings via you smartphone.
