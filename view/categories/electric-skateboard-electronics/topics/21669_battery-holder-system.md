what a good idea to have nuts and screws flying on the table while you are assembling a battery pack like that :scream:

Go to `http://www.vruzend.in`. They cost 19€ and 20€ for shipping. You can email them and their reply is very fast and give you all the info needed.
Positives: don't need weld. And if any battery goes bad, you can simply change it.

I'm not. I've seen the video and contacted them. 

This is my first post because I'm new to esk8 building and I'm just learning.

If you're new don't buy anything until you research and get advice.

I think the sticks are not long enough...it might also be limited by the contact area with the battery...
Ask their support or search their forum to be sure...
