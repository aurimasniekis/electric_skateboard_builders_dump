i have a feeling that it something regarding the ESC/Motor/remote . but im not sure where exactly.
im going to try to connect a normal 2.4ghz remote controller.
but will appriciate if someone have any idea what the issue could be???

Thanks!

hello offir,

did you get any solution for this problem. For me, it works with a set of motors but with "bigger" ones it doesn't. I assume it is a topic with voltage protection. 

I will try removing the cutoff monitoring, maybe it will works.

Cheers.
