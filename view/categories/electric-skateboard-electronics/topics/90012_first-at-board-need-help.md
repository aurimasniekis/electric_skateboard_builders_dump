First you need to decide your budget.
Do you want an "SUV" with spring trucks or something more like evolve?
168kv is a lot of torque, you can probably go higher if you want more speed instead.
For your desired range you'll probably need a 10s4p, maybe 5p.
Definitely get a vesc! There's plenty of different ones to choose from.

if you use a flat deck than you can use channel trucks only with riser or you use street trucks.

for battery you should let us know if you want them top mount or under your board.

[/quote]

If you specifically want 12s I'd recommend the FOCbox or a decent vesc 6 variant. Flipsky's mini 4.20 is also supposed to be able to handle 12s without any trouble but it's still unproven for that on a mass production scale. It can definitely handle 10s though.

Those trucks look fine if a bit on the heavy side. Having off-road tires on the rear and streets in the front could be good for overall use- more traction in the back and grippier steering in the front- but I don't actually know.

For a mtb board, hes gonna need atleast 6p to get that range. They chew through alot more current than any normal board

Quick advice for those trucks, they work great but the mounts have a few flaws. First off, get a steel beam and bolt it to the bottom of the motor mounts, they flex under torque and this prevents them being pulled towards the wheel. Second, if you can make bar going across the top side of the mount do that. I had one mounts break at the 90Â° angle. I should have seen it coming and added a filet weld in there to strengthen it.

```
15ah minimum 10 or 12s rated for 120a discharge at a minimum if you have a few weeks to wait i can build you a 10s8p pack if you want.
