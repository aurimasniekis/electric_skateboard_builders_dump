Don't over tighten your belt.  The belt needs a little bit of play in it.  Just make sure the motor gear and the wheel gear are lined up.  Set the motor gear pulley with locketite so it doesn't move.

Posting some pictures will go a long ways for the online diagnosis process to work properly :)

Can you flip the board over and take some pictures looking directly down at the board, and then a few looking at the mount from the side?

Would you, or any other seasoned builder, mind making a video or photo tutorial on your method to align the pulleys properly?

I can give it a go if you want to send it over? I don't want money, just pay the shipping.
Do you have any photos of where you are at? I won't get a chance to look at it until next weekend.
Is the rest of the board working?
