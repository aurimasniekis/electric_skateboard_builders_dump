Yesterday I ran my new 10s6p almost flat (4% left). This morning 14 hours later its only 88% full. I think thats hell of a long time. Is that just the way it is (with the charger I have) or could there be an issue?

What would be a good upgraded charger? EDIT: if I want a bad mother fucker that can do tricks.

Specs:

Battery: 10s6p Samsung 18650 30Q. 
Charger: Output 2A
Battery cut off: start 32V end 30V
Charged inside
Need more info?

You have 18ah, there's a good chance that charger isn't delivering a full 2A so I would say it could be right, also if one P was higher than the rest it could slow down charging till the rest catch up and it wouldn't hurt to double check wiring, make sure everything is solid
Especially with large packs those chargers can get quite hot and lose efficiency, not to mention horribly skinny leads
A true 2A charge with CC/CV for 18Ah should be about 12hrs

It shouldnt take longer than 10hr for that

The charging current decreases as you enter the cv phase, not sure what percentage you're getting that at. :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

Thanks - The p-groups were all balanced yesterday. 

The charger doesn't get particularly hot.

The connection is not a perfect fit, but I can't imagine thats the issue?

I will run it flat again and try my other charger (the one that comes with my evolve).

Is it possible one is 2.1mm and the other 2.5mm ? It should slide all the way down

Are you using a BMS?

That could be possible. It dose not slide all the way down. Is not a perfect fit. Would that effect charging time?

How low, do you run your cells down ?

That is to low if you ask me... I run mine down to 35v max, and with voltage sag and when you hitting a hill they often run down arround 30v for short periode of time.... Check that the cell voltage between the cells stil is spot on.
Also you Will lose capacity a lot faster, when you run them down like this.

Double this and half your charge time.

P-groups still spot on. We are now at 94% :) 

All the wiring seems solid.

Ok - I might fund the issue. I turns out that the plug is a tight fit and I was afraid to apply the force needed to make a proper connection. It was dangling and I had to secure with tape for it to not fall out. Its actually fits good. Lets see if that effects the time.

I use a 6a charger on my 13s5p, but my cutoff end is 3.35/cell Takes about 2.5 hours to charge, and musters around 40-45miles of range... 

I don't fully deplete mine (2.6v/cell) as after 3.35v on 30q the current falls off... Sure  I could get alot more range, but...meh...

I agree, and you expand you life of Q30 dramatically, if you stop before the big current / voltage drop comes.......

Thanks guys I will take that in to consideration. Hopefully my battery will give me enough range, so I do not need to go all the way to 30 most times. But I think I would Like to be able to If needed once in a while.

@Deckoz what kind of chargeport are you using for your 6A charger? Just a normal dc one or another to be sure to handle the 6A?

I use this charger for my 10S 5Ah pack and it works great! Charging time is around 1h for me

Just a regular 2.5mm ID 5.5mm OD DC barrel. I have 16guage wire soldered to the DC jack to the BMS internally.. 

The charger is just a c300 body with the amps cranked up to 6a, so whatever the charger wire is..it does fine too.

Did you change the plug to DC or are you using the one it comes with?

I got a 5a charger and used it first time yesterday. It fried the wire from the charging port. 

![IMG_6736|667x500](upload://dY3j51WTRTBLdSWPA9z3r8Ub0Np.jpg)

I changed the wire to 18awg and now it works fine. The charging port get warm. I can still hold it, but it is close that I can't. Nothing else gets even the slightest warm. 

I still want to be able to charge faster. So I am thinking of trying out a 7a charger, but I am afraid that the charging port can't keep up. @Deckoz you use 6a and that works fine for you. Have you checked if the port get warm? And just to be sure you are using such a port right? :  

![IMG_6739|666x500](upload://4choLh2TFOizobzr75eUjPEyh6u.JPG)

Has anyone tried 7a charger with such a port?

Mine doesn't get hotter then body temperature, maybe around 100F? I've charged it in the sun and the charger and charge cable got hot, but was relatively cool at the plug.

The charge plug on my Evo, was actually the charge plug I made for my vanguard, which was a 10s 5A charger, that board had almost 6000 miles on it and was only a 9Ah battery. I was out of DC plugs when I built the Evo and stole the plug from that battery, and now put almost 1300 miles on the Evo with 13S 6A charger and that original plug from my vanguard. 

Like I think I said above, I always use 16ga wire, and never had any issues with heat, or sparking etc.
