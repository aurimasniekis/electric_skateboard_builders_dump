Hello guys :slight_smile:
The shipping cost from hobbyking is very expensive, if I buy 50$ battery the shipping will be 50$.
I found those suspicious lipos from aliexpress. They are cheap like hobbyking's lipos or even more. they are 2.4 Wh/$ (zippys are 2~)

I have experience with these. They are okay but not idiot proof. You have to balance them as often as possible or they'll slowly start to unbalance. They have good capacity and discharge rate. 

7/10 from me. Because they're so cheap

Buy them from eBay you'll find bigger capacity and high voltage for good deals
