Has anyone looked into taking the guts from a broken (or unwanted) hoverboard and using the hub motors from it to make an electric longboard? You can get broken ones for fairly cheep (ive seen them around $100). You would get two sensored hub motors in 6.5"-10" wheels (depending on the hoverboard). and a questionable but potentially good enough 36v lipo pack.

You would have to get pneumatic wheels of a similar size for the front obviously, but since the wheels would be bigger I would have to imagine it would give you a much better ride.

I'm thinking about possibly going that route with my build, but I figured I would ask if anyone has done it before.

They would make awesome electric mountain board wheels but you would have to modify the hell out of them. I brought this up in another thread a while back and somebody mentioned that they are just insanely low KV and you would basically have to re-wind the stators to make them useful on an eboard. In their current state, they're basically all torque and no top end, i think they max out at like 5 or 7 mph. That's what would have to change, and i think it could be done. That is to say, i want somebody to do it so i can see what happens.

good idea ! i wanted to salvage the used 22V 18650 cells . 20 of them . but owner havent reply . since you've mentioned the hub motors . I'll look out for it ðŸ˜ƒ

If you would be willing. I think a good first step would be hooking up one of the motors to an esc/battery, and just seeing how fast it will go.

It's 22 volts? Then hooking up a vesc on 12s might be kinda nice. Maybe double the speed. Maybe u could do more volts/speed since the kv is so low

i did that! at 22 volts it went about 7mph or so not very fast.  i just used a 120 fvt esc.  

The motors are brushless sensored.  But are missing one sensor wire (they only have 5) we use 6.  Not sure what thats all about

it went about 7mph

 boooooooo =(

i wonder if you can push more volts through it though. and if you can get enough of a speed boost from that.

well its built for 36 volts.  I ran it at only 22 so you might be able to get like 12 mph out of it maybe.  Thats pretty good for an off road board.  If you ran sensors on it, this thing could be used for some extreme off road situations.

This hub motor would work for sure. I believe Onloop new mountainboard video is using a hoverboard hub motor mounted on a custom made truck. I have these thoughts as well to use hoverboard motor, but if I can't get my hands on the truck, its hard to make this happen.

My thoughts for a truck, would be to get a steel truck, and weld on a steel pipe (on the bottom or back side of the truck) that would fit around the axle of the motors. then just have a cutout in the middle of the pipe for the wires to go through. and use bolts in the pipe to clamp down on the axle of the motor.

you dont need to to be a shaft, just a steel tube would proably work. http://www.mcmaster.com/#steel-hollow-rods/=125dxyn 

possibly even aluminum depending on how you are planning on attaching it to the trucks, this stuff is even described as being used as a shaft http://www.mcmaster.com/#standard-aluminum-hollow-tubing/=125dz21

Yes. I've already made all the adjustments and drilled the holes for it. My hub motors have two different size bearings so I ordered an extra 17mm ID bearing to match one of them. Last step is to find a fitting shaft lol. I'll work around that

They either have to go thru the middle directly or I can grind out a small notch on the side of the shaft to have them go out that way. I could use a regular shaft.  

It just has to be 17mm and they seem to only have inch. 
.669in I'm gonna look if that have that

I can't because then it would make finding a right fitting shaft even harder because of the bore on the core of the motor. The part that holds the windings. I'm gonna have to stick with 17. I thought about shimming it but I don't know how good that would be for motor bearings lol I'll keep u updated

okay so the square tube was a no go! lol needless to say.. and i coudlnt find a 17mm diameter steel rod or shaft or tube or pipe for anything under 80 bucks.   so i went with the next best thing which is a 21/32 inch or a .65625 inch steel rod.  17mm is .66929 so its about .01304 inch of play which converts to .33 of a millimeter of play.  I will try to shim that in the best way i can figure, but once i do that ill have to cut a key way and drill a hole through the rod for the wires to come out.  but i think it can work.

Yes I'll post pictures when i get home today.    The square would have worked okay with the bearings but it wouldnt have held the part of the motor with the copper wire very center.

I might return the 21/32 rod because it might have too much play.  
 currently looking for a 43/64 rod.  

God i hate our system of measurement

I have a hoverboard wheel and a VESC. I soldered 10gauge bullet connectors on to the three connections of the hoverboard wheel in order to connect it to the VESC motor connections. I wish to use the encoder it comes with, and I was wondering if anyone has done this successfully? I notice the 'Encoder' the hoverboard wheel/motor comes with has only 5 pins, and there is no 5 pin connection on the VESC. Any feedback would be great!

@danielrodriguez 
Not sure if this helps, but it looks like that sides are for power... middle pins are for phases..
It was sort of mentioned, that the motor is for ''hoverboards'' so perhaps there is a resemblance

@danielrodriguez

Im afraid you might need to create a new topic of write this question in a different topic.. is there a topic about sensored motors?

This is because im not quite sure how many ppl look into this topic.. and it just seems a bit smart, to ask about this, in a specialised topic, where ppl have connected sensor wires to the vesc/esc. I believe it usually is a bit hard to determine which cable is which..

Or - ask @barajabali as it looks like, he has made the hoverboard motor to run!

Here is earlier thoughts on topic;

Hoverboard hubmotor ZRT Raspberry Pi Board

Just finished a hoverboard hack into a skateboard and need to find better controllers.
Has anyone built a ZRT board, or hacked the hoverboard, orused 2 Vescs with two remotes, or one combo remote for zeroT? Has anyone actually done position control with a BLDC motor.

If anyone is useing a raspberry Pi on board I was wondering if they have figured out how to run the Vesc software on it? Also I now use 2 Pi's since I can't figure outhow to make one Pibe both a WiFi hotspot and a client at the same time. Right now, one Pi is the hotspot and get internet via a short ethernet from the second Pi which is a WiFi client. Anyone interested in this please let me know and I will upload more details.

i used a hoverboard wheel for a scooter. 10s3p with a 800 watt ebike controller i was getting about 15-20mph
i rewound the motor 7t 1.6mm wire and i was getting 30mph with the same controller.
the problem i found is the hard tyres, i could not find a tyre to fit the rim or they would have been awesome,

Pretty cool. I'm not a motor expert so need some help understanding. Rewinding the coils or rewiring delta to wye? Looks like the coils.What does that give you going to thicker wire and less turns, a different kv rating and max speed?
Can the tires be taken off the hubs easily, would be nice to have bigger knobbier tires.

This looks cool! I had a hoverboard but then one of my siblings took it outside in the wet grass one morning and broke it. Not sure what exactly is wrong with it but it just won't stop beeping. Anyway I took it all apart and its in pieces right now... probably never going to do anything with it though

I built my kids an electric tricycle using a couple 8" hoverboard wheels. I got a little kid bike at Goodwill for $5 and welded an extension to the frame to make it longer (otherwise the low end torque of the motors tended to make it wheelie if the kid driving it hit the throttle too hard). To mount the wheels I found that the best way was:

Take a piece of plain old hardware store 3/4" weldable steel tube and a 1/2"X1/8" bar and cut the bar to match the length of the ground section of the mounting axle so it sits snugly on top of the shaft in the ground away spot. I then drilled and tapped two holes for M8 bolts in the top of the tube so that, when tightened down, the ends of the bolts press down on the section of the bar that sits in the ground out spot. (Obviously you weld the tube to whatever you want to mount the wheel to before you put the wheel in and clamp down the bolts. If the ride is going to be bump I'd advise using some locktite on the bolts to mage sure they don't vibrate loose since they're each only tapped through a 1/16" thick bit of steel, although the curvature of the tube works in your favor here as a flat 1/16" thick sheet with an M8 tapped hole would not be rigid enough to hold it steady).

So I found that this contraption will haul me up a rather steep hill (10% grade or so) as a 150lb adult plus the 40lbs of steel that is the trike (I built the frame extension out of 1/8" thick L beams because I had 'em in my scrap pile and the hardware store was closed when I was slapping this together).

Reviving old thread, sue me.

I got a pair of "inoperable" hoverboards from ebay, cause the motors probably worked, I've tested them all and they do. I ended up with a 24v and 36v version, they both have 16mm axles, but the 24v version is shorter by 25mm. Jehu's solution to adapt the wheels to paris trucks was cleaver, but wasteful and sketch cause they clearly didn't fit properly. Current effort is on adapting the wheel axles to calibre hangers to reduce cost. In an ideal world, I'd mill a hanger with axle slots similar to what exists for current in hub motors on the market. The plan at the moment which I can't really get on until March is to use a 3/4"x1/16" pipe as the initial mount to keep the wheels aligned, then u-bolt the clamp that came with the hoverboard to the bottom of the hangar and see how that goes, will also try making a 3D printed "cartilage" piece to try and better mate the hangers, pipe and u-bolts. I'll update as I make progress.

Short update, first test fit of my adapter, I'm pretty happy with it, everything's very tight, though I'm still worried I'm pushing the limits of 3D printed parts. I'll need to tweak some tolerances, then make the other side, fab the alignment pipe/axle then I can give it a test ride.

Why so complicated? I used lightning rod holder and metal tube (pushed on truck thread) ![wheel_hoverbaord|562x500](upload://xOdDZgx9aSxycpgM1KkAofmMkom.jpeg)

That's a smart idea, though the wear pattern looks like you got some camber angle. I'm trying to eliminate any flexing the wheel axle might have from the adapter. Your wheel probably also toes in when accelerating and toes out when braking. I'm also trying to keep the overall width down. Is the tube you mentioned acting as a spacer for the ends of the lightning bolt mount?

Okay I got it put together, more complicated than I wanted but I wanted as much inlaid metal as possible. There are M3 screws bolting the shells together, hose clamps keeping the plastic adapters compressed, and u-bolts holding the wheels to the alignment pipe. gonna road test it later, it weighs a shit ton.

So far so good, will stand up to brick driveway and paved road and me jumping up and down on it, when it dries more outside I'll put in through more abuse to test the structure, powering them will come later.

update: Aight, it's holding, next is to wire it in place of the current drive train, might make a whole new board for it, probably.![UVIU9295|666x500](upload://5TUAYu35RB9vM62BeoCsXCqg9j7.jpeg)

That pattern is on metal tube and its from pliers (it scratched when i pushed it on truck).
Metal carved tube is some kind of spacer for better wheel and truck fixation. It also glued to truck with special glue for bolts.

My project is almost finished and after some ride (~10km) i can tell that it looks more stable than jehugarcia solution. I'll put some video and pictures in a week or a two to see final result... :)

What type of lightening rod holder did you use? I'm trying to use a similar system for attaching my motor shafts.

Weve purchased 6-7 of the hub motors for really a competitive price and longhairedboy is right, their max rpm value is low. We are building a 6 wheel armadillo board not to have a speed ride but for some performance analysis on our electronics, remote and battery system. We manufactured spring type trucks for the hub motors of course, with angular orientation.

I ended up buying a few sets of these hoverboard conversion mountain board trucks. One supplier sent me wedge raisers, the other did not. The raisers are necessary for normal boards as the kingpins are flat and not at an angle like standard trucks.

Continuing the discussion from [Hoverboard motors for Esk8?](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hoverboard-motors-for-esk8/1957):

I has an old hoverboard,this one [all terrain hoverboard](https://asiwo.com/all-terrain-hoverboard-ul-2272-certified-electric-smart-self-balancing-scooter.html),itâ€™s motors are 8.5 inch,will be too bigger to install on the board?Maybe Iâ€™d better repair it,I like it so much.It was stable and powerful,even in the sand.
