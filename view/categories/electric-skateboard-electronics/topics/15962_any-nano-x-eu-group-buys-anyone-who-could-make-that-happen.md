As the title says, are there anyone doing or thinking of doing a group buy on the NANO-X remote from Enertion? I would really like one but I don't want to pay more for the shipping than the product itself... 

If no one does it, let me know how many in EU is interested of getting one...

Might ask this question to @unik . Perhaps he knows some ppl in France who would be willing to do that. It looks like they have a growing esk8 user community there! Would be interested at later stage.. but right now I dont need extra remote yet.. so perhaps after a 5months or so :)
