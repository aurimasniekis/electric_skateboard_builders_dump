I am facing to a stupid situation: I've upgraded to 23.45 and I did not take screenshot of previous values before upgrade, what are the full list of values for NazarÃ© to complete the configuration?

Battery parameters, and other are ok except values Bellow:

Q1: Sub menu "Advanced config" of "Motor Calibration"  lets us  3 parameters to configure, what are the right value to set?
pwm frequency: 
Sensored to sensorless Transition RPM:
Sensorless OpenLoop RPM:

Q2: Why do you deactivate Motor thermal throttling?

Q3: what is the conservative value to set for max allowed motor temperature, and what is the definition and range for Motor BETA?

Q4: HUD Config screen: what is: the expected value for test erpm -> rpm?
```
