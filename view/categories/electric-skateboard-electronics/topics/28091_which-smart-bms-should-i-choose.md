Hello,

My setup is a standard 50-60A VESC (not decided yet for a 6374 motor) and a 4P10S Li-Ion Batterypack (Samsung INR18650-25R 2500mAh - 20A). I will also charge through the BMS.

I am deciding between the [Tiny BMS s516](https://www.energusps.com/shop/product/tiny-bms-s516-150a-750a-36?category=4) with 60A continous (upgradable) or the [HCX-D338](http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/BMS-D338.html) with up to 80A continous.

For me quality is very important because I want my batterys for as long as possible and without problems to reduce the risk of a esk8 as much as possible! 

also I want it to be smart so I can use it on other projects (if I decide to take it apart).

Last question: Where can I buy the Basetech if I decide to use it or where can i find a price?

Thanks

They only sell by email. MOQ is 2 pieces and shipping is expensive (what I've read from other threads)
