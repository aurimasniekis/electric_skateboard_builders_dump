So I plugged in my VESC and it gave me the error Fault            : FAULT_CODE_DRV8302
Current          : -0.6
Current filtered : 0.2
Voltage          : 41.52
Duty             : 0.02
RPM              : 1.9
Tacho            : 12
Cycles running   : 4
TIM duty         : 991
TIM val samp     : 523
TIM current samp : 22415
TIM top          : 43784
Comm step        : 6
Temperature      : 28.34

So I gather this is a problem with the DRV, Is anybody able to replace this for me?
