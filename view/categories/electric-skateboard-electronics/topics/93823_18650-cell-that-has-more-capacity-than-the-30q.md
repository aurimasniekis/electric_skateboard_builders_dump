Hey everyone

I wanna build a battery pack and am searching for the best 18650.
I know 30q are well known for how good they hold up but the problem is that they “only” have 3000mah.
Isn’t there another 18650 type of cell that has more than 3000mah and 15a or 20a? The 35e is great but it has only 10a which if I build it into a 12s4p will not supply the full 50a that the vesc needs to give me full power

Thanksssss

That's the be bang for the buck. But if you go bigger than 18650,c there are other options

30Q's are well known for not only for how they hold up, but a great balance between cost, capacity, discharge, and size. If you want more mah the Samsung 40T is slight bigger (21700) but with a whole amp hour more capacity and a whopping 30 amp discharge

Some verision of VTC6 has 3100mah. However, the amp draw isn't limited to what it says on the cell. Rather what temperature it reaches during the discharge. If you have sufficient airflow, theres normally not a problem to draw more then 10A on a 35e cell. Deciding factor is by far the climate at where you live. Keep the cells at a healthy temp and you can draw more current, simple as that.

The 30q performs better then the hg2 I believe.

30Q is a very good cell.

The SANYO 20700B is a very good cell with a slight increase in size.
If you are concerned about capacity, I think it is better to consider a battery of 12s4p or more.
Under the condition of 18650, 12s4p, 50A, it is best to have 30Q.

LG HG2

they were the option before 30q - but they're pricier, and has more sag.  and hg2 is one of the most counterfeited cells out there.

Higher capacity usually means lower discharge rate because they are two competing parameters. Taken from [Battery University](https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/discharge_characteristics_li):

> Energy and power characteristics are defined by particle size on the electrodes. Larger particles increase the surface area for maximum capacity and fine material decreases it for high power.

Which sort of explains why Samsung still hasn't released a successor to the 30Q :upside_down_face:

I wanted to go for the 21700 but unfortunately most of the cases I found aren’t enough for a 21700 12s4p configuration, almost all of them will fit only 12s3p from the 21700 and it’s not worth it to pay more for the 21700 but get the same mah that I’ll get from the 18650

I know they are really great but as I said it won’t be wirth it cuz I wanted to go for the 21700 12s4p (which won’t fit any low profile enclosure) so it’s not worth it to pay more for the 21700 12s3p but get the same mah that I’ll get from the 18650

Then get the 30Q's, you honestly won't find much better than that. Anything higher capactiy is lower discharge (i.e 35e).

Yea you are right but always being in the safe side of things is better, like I live in Germany which is always cold but still I don’t wanna stress the batteries too much to the point where I look to my back and find flames you know?

They are just like the 30q only 3000mah, yea more amps but same mah

Haha, pushing them abit passed what theyre intended for wont cause flames ;) 
If you run a belted setup with good gear ratio, you have alot of margin in regards to current.
In such an application, keeping a constant high drain for a longer period is seldom seen. Only way is to climb a really steep hill. Unless you have these hills. Sure, youll draw alot of current on startup maybe 50A and higher. But that top peak only lasts for so long. Keeping a constant speed doesnt consume an awful lot, something most people seem to forget. Sure margins are good. But if you draw 80A for 3 seconds on a pack that only should do 40-50 amps cont., nothing bad will happen(again, temp plays part here). You might cause more ware on your cells, but thats it.

The optimal cell differs depending on the condition to be determined.  However, I think 30Q is the best for the 18650 single stack.
Evolve GTR uses 10s4p35E, but this is very interesting.
Optimal gear ratio, optimal wheels, not too fast.
Under this condition, 35E may be a good balance.

Th solution is simple, build a 12s5p or a 12s6p depending on the range you are looking for.

Does anyone know any reasons why LG MJ1 is not a good choice? 

In a 4p config 40a continuous and and peak maybe like 60a for short bursts?

they perform about as well as 35E's. Might as well get whichever one's cheaper and/or available.

Thanks for the link! :+1: :sunglasses: 

Oh I see at 10 amps its not good compared to 30q.

![image|690x467](upload://pDnN9bRC2Mrrq31287QzyeidWa.png)

30q is also cheaper. 

Seems like you would not get the extra capacity unless you only draw like 3 amps per cell.

For 3500mAh and 18650, SANYO NCR18650GA seems to be highly evaluated.
There is a big difference in 10A discharge.
It is worth considering if it is more than 8p of 2wd.

Problem is that I need 15a per cell so that I can reach the useable 50amps that the VESC can use and if I use those I’ll only be having 40a you get me?

Hmm yea that makes sense I guess that’s the thing to do or just build it in a 12s5p configuration but also the problem is that I won’t find a slim low profile that will fit it:roll_eyes:

I would build a 12s5p  pack out of 30q cells. I made my board with that. I used a case from psychotiller with a 80a bestech bms and flipsky dual 6.6 vesc(a very large vesc, much bigger then the focbox). I got it all to fit but barely. So thats a 12s pack with 75amp output and 15ah capacity for a total of 666wh. The thing is a beast! I can barely stay on at full throttle from a dead stop, and the steepest hills are a joke! The power is unreal! That's what I would do or i should say did..lol

Yea I bet it’s crazy which case did u use? But let me ask u how much does that thing weigh? I don’t have a car and I use public transport (as I live out of town) so I don’t want the board to be too heavy. I have a hub motored 10s3p board and I consider it heavy (didn’t weigh it but I bet it’s around the 10kg mark)
```

## \#34 Posted by: Randy_bobandy Posted at: 2019-05-24T08:18:50.480Z Reads: 49

It is pretty damn heavy lol. The bkb 6374 motors on it make it  alot heavier as well. I would say its like 13kg. The cells weigh 48g(60cells) and the motors are 900g each. That is its downside as it does weigh a lot. My board is simply for fun and I don't use it to commute so weight wasn't a priority for me. The trucks are huge as well(torqueboard 218mm). The enclosure is the altered wedge. But if you want to do a 10s pack I found a decent enclosure on amazon for $30USD, I can put a link if you are interested.

30Q will give you the best cap/current/price...
I'm using a 10S2P (8Ah) with 40T cells, very nice cells but if I get the same weight with a 10S3P (9Ah) with 30Q cells and both packs will giv the same power output, so I don't know if you can get better cells for that price.

Except vtc6, but if you're using only max 15A/cell there's no adventage to go with vtc6 and their lifespan is not as good as 30Q.

Maybe this is something to look at:
https://hobbyking.com/nl_nl/turnigy-5000mah-1s-40c-lipoly-single-cell.html?___store=nl_nl
If you build a 12S2P with these cells will perform good I think.
I've build several boards with the 20C cells of these and they were pretty good and light weight.

Edit: okey nevermind, a 12S2P with these lipo's will be 3120grams and a 12S4P with 30Q only 2208grams so they won't be better for you 😅
