So I found this on eBay: http://www.ebay.com/itm/VESC-4-12-Motor-controller-open-source-BLDC-Speed-Controller-VESC-vedder-Pcb-/182234724017?hash=item2a6e0936b1:g:oFwAAOSwZ1BXe6Ct

ItÂ´s a VESC with all of the mosfets on one side so that a big heatsink can be attached.

What are your thoughts on it?

Personally I stick to vedders reference design.
It has proven itself, and I believe there was a reason to do it the way it was done (shorter traces and better layout maybe).

Plus, HW version 6 is already in its last stages.

Is there any firm expectation on when this will roll through to a production stage? Is it still like 6 months before vendors will be offering it?

I think the first ones will start to roll out in about three months, no idea when they will be widely available.
