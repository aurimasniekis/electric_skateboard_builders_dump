Does anyone have a binding procedure for binding a Benchwheel remote and receiver. The manual that came with my remote and receiver doesn't show the binding procedure. I'm trying to bind two receivers to one remote. I understand the Benchwheel remote has two channel output. Does that work for two receivers? Appreciate any help.

Thanks RiGo. I'm ordering two Benchwheel remotes and will try to bind then together when they arrive. Seems to be a difficult thing to do when you don't use can bus or a two output receiver. My VESCs are separated. Ackmaniac said to use UART and I'm sure that's what to do if I can figure it out. Appreciate the help.
