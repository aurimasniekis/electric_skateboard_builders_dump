Has anyone tried them out yet? 6374 motor looks nice, but the kv is a bit high at 240kv. Most people seem to use 190kv, but since it's quite a beefy motor would dual 6374 230kv work okay?

240kv is great for a 6s setup! It can be used at 10s too, but if you have the standard 4.12 hw vesc, you will need to be careful with the max rpm

Would definitely be going Foxbox or Vesc6 so hopefully won't be a problem.

Then it should be okay. However its not optimal if you dont want to go 60 kmh
