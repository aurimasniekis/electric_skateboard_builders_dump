Hey guys,

What are you setting your LVCs for your liion cells? What voltage per cell?

Wierd...ya mine is set at 3.1 volts. But everywhere else I have been reading has been stating that anywhere below 3.3 volts is 0%...

that's how meters read it. 3.3ish volts should be 0% and while you can keep going past that, you don't want to do it too often to prolong the life of the cell.
