I am going off the clock right now but I will be back in the shop tomorrow morning. If you you still need assistance tomorrow I will be happy to run through configuration with you over the phone. Shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

@Kaylee1389  Do you currently have the bldc-tool installed on your computer? If not, what operating system are you using?

You can check out the VESC fan's here: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/search?q=esc%20faq

There are a couple videos linked there as well. The motor detection guide has a very comprehensive video that goes start to finish on setting up your BLDC motor with the VESC.
