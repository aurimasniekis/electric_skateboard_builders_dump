# Do you think it would be possible to buy a meepo board and swap out parts for better components?

I was just wondering about this, because so far I've heard great things about the meepo board aside from voltage sag and others. 

Hub motors and the ESC might not be a good idea to mess with, but would it be possible to switch out the meepo's for a similarly spec'd battery pack with a higher C rating? That might not play well with the settings on the ESC, but it'd be an interesting hypothetical

EDIT: Swapping the ESC top get more speed

Yes, but then you would need a new enclosure because you will need a bigger battery to ‘lessen’ the voltage sag.. you could all ways build your own and just by the individual parts off of eBay or Taobao (considering that all Meepo does).

Yeah I'm 90% done with my own DIY board, this is all just hypotheticals I was wondering about from watching the videos on it ha

Just go the usual DIY route and get yourself a VESC and a decent drive train. Stay away from the meepo... I've seen the inside job and its a big fkn mess.

I've watched a few vids about the meepo and i'm sure I have seen more than a couple people say the deck itself felt cheap and had little or no concave. One vid I watched last night from FabTrav on youtube they were discussing how it compared to the BB. Obviously it won't have that quality for $300. Then again most people are surprised at how well it works for the price and seem quite content with it. If you get it and everything is working good maybe change the deck first.

Good Luck

Next week i'm gonna be doing Meepo upgrade to 12s2p pack from DIY and different deck. Testing w/o load at 50v seemed to work fine. Still have to load test but Kieran confirmed the ESC and motor works at 50v. He's not sure how long though, so I'll have to find out.

please let me know how easy it is to swap deck. even better...make a video of it. im curious how you would run the wires from battery to esc neatly.  will you use flat wires or carve into the deck for the clean look... 
thanks!

I've seen people do 10s2p setups in the past.  It stands to reason that you should be able to swap the esc's for Vescs, run detections, program the vesc and it should theoretically work.  I don't know what the amp draw is for his motors though but i doubt it is too high as he is selling with 10s2p pack.

check the link in my reply to Veovis!
Sorry, forgot to answer your Q. I'm planning on replacing the battery and enclosure which will house the ESC from Meepo as well. Based on other posting on reddit, many people are showing how to upgrade the deck. For a clean divided enclosures you'll have to route the wire above the deck along a slot and cover with grip tape.

I asked Meepo when they might release their own battery upgrade. Well they just did so yesterday and it is on their site. That price can't be right though right (more expensive than a Meepo board)? I have asked him a few times if it is right already. Am waiting for a response now.

https://meepoboard.com/products/upgrade-battery-for-meepo-board

20 cells of SANYO 20700B cells.

10S2P 8.5AH 

RANGE around 30 kms or more.

- a few reading moments later, I haven't heard back from him but it seems that the price is legit. It is just still unclear to me what you are getting when you order it.

Text from the page:
WHEN YOU need to Upgrade your Meepo Board to SANYO battery.

You chose variation of REPLACE/UPGRADE.  We will ship your meepo board with SANYO battery and WITHOUT ordinary battery.
Price for this is $240 on sale price. So if I order this am I right in thinking that I will get a complete Meepo board with the Sanyo battery?
 

WHEN you picked EXTRA battery, we will send an SANYO battery as extra.
Price for this is $270. If I order this am I right in thinking I will get a complete Meepo board with Samsung battery plus a Sanyo battery as extra, or a complete Meepo board with Sanyo battery and an extra Sanyo battery?

It is just so unclear to me, not to mention that if you simply order the Meepo board the price is $259.99

Just buy the Meepo components from diyeboard.com. It's probably cheaper than buying a Meepo and throwing away half of it.

The line is under the grip tape and in-bedded in a cut out grove in the board then drops through a hole.  If someone knows how to use a l machine you could cut a groove in your own board

I bought one too.  Just waiting for it to get here as well.  I saw the reviews about the deck so I went and bought my own.  I got the bamboo white wave drifter<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/b/eb00bcdd87070b0bf4af15f163534dfb295aef81.jpg" width="190" height="236">
I will be transferring the components.  It will be   "The White Wave Drifter Meepo Board" 
I will take it for a few rides, then do the transfer and post the process.

I have been really enjoying my Meepo board. I am sure you will too even with the stock deck. You should at least give it a try and then swap after.

I am looking at getting a new deck too to swap it over. Haven't decided yet on which deck though. Probably it will be a drop down drop through double kick longboard. Saw this Saterno deck which I really like:

https://www.skateboard-webshop.nl/longboard/longboard-compleet/saterno-forest-leaf-double-down-dark-370-x-98.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw8qRsIPU1gIVF7cbCh2EowdXEAQYAyABEgLOFfD_BwE

I only wish to find something similar with the stripes on the top and same color wood but then slightly longer. Haven't been able to yet.

I just finished my Meepo swap. I haven't had a chance to test it extensively, however it already seems like a new eskate. The deck is a no name cheapo that I had laying around. I also swapped the front wheels for Bigfoot 90mm Cored Classics from Amazon. They definitely seem softer than the clones that came on it. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/1/61c5653724c19d3d775187db58c25d941c08e5c8.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I have been watching videos of meepos not able to keep up with boosted in hill climb, drag race, braking and range.  
I have a solution for this but have not figured the electronics yet.
The solution would be to buy another meepo board and make it all wheel drive.  I may be able to do it from just buying spare parts from off the site.  The hard part would be the synchronization of all 4 motor or I should say VESC the brain chip.  The site sells extra motors, VESC.  I would have to change out the front truck, find out how to conect the two VESC.  theres is different then others i have seen.  It is a double vesc able to run two motors off each one.  you would at least double your torque.  I wonder if you could even give evolve or raptor a run

ok I went back to the meepo site and looked up components for all wheel drive from meepo site.  

extra motor  $50 normal sale $42.60    x 2 = $85.20
dual esc $56
rear truck $12
esc cable $2
= $155.00 usd plus shipping

I'm also hearing about the board being stiff in the turns and changing out to softer bushings is a good idea

Im already in the process of an upgrade/diy from meepo =) ive had my board almost 2 months and ride it for fun and making deliveries in NYC.. average about 10-15mi a day 4days a week about... I got a blank deck online, and a few ebay battery packs....so hopefully by next week Ill have all the components and build it up for a 10s6p... that said i do love the board, the grab handle really is the smallest bit that i find the most useful, the deck is ok but not my fav so hopefully the new deck doesnt let me down .. now more range... and maybe by spring a motor upgrade of some sort

Meepo just updated the board to a 1.5. They made an offer to get the better deck and battery they will ship it with a new Meepo 1.5. I have 2 questions. There isn't anywhere in the US to get a better battery cheaper? Anyone live in South Florida looking to buy a Meepo maybe we can work out a deal.

Could you use two of these?  (would have to use a Y connector, or do a little re-wiring I'd imagine.

Remember that you have to connect the remote with 2 esc simultaneously. I'm afraid you wold meet a problem there. If you really want a powerful board and a single  meepo does not fill your needs than 2 meepos won't do it either. I sold my meepo board. And I have built one board with only meepo type motors and esc(for friends to try) since I'm building another more hard core for mysel. Im using batter packs made of a123 cells like boosted board or Sony vtc6. 
Remember its not meepo that produces any of this parts. They just assembly the board. You can get every single  part for cheaper price from China.
