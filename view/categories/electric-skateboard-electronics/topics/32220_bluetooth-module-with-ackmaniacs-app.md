Hello guys,
I want to use Ackmaniac's android application and I got a HM-10 module from a local dealer and it looks like is just the Clone one..  (not the clone of clone) So i figured it should be ok. But i cannot see it in your application no matter what i tried.

I see the module in bluetooth settings of my phone: is the BT05.

When i open the application i see Device V1.52 and in right part scan / stop but is not finding anything else. Any idea on that ? Do i need to flash another firmware on the BLE module ? or that wont help.

Thank you. (i have Ackmaniac's firmware on my vesc too) Maybe someone have any experience with these clones ?

I'm using a cheap HM-10 Module as well hooked up to my VESC over the UART port and it's working fine. @Ackmaniac maybe you have some advice for  @Bloop.

I talked with Ackmaniac and he said to use the one he linked and i will but it will take a few more weeks till i get that. 

Wondering if anyone else had similar problems and maybe have some advices ?

I got this exact one, soldered the wires from my connector to the bluetooth module, and it works great, no problems at all.  I made sure to insulate each connection with heat shrink as well.

All you can do is:
1) tx and rx need to be crossed
2) 5V should be used instead of 3.3V
3) correct baud rate in the Vesc settings needs to be set (maybe your module has a different default instead of the 9600 - you could check via AT serial commands)
```

I connected at 5v also tx rx are crossed and the baud rate is at 9600 but the problem is not the transmission. The problem is that the app dont see the BLE module. And no idea how to solve that.

Some modules simply just donÂ´t work with the vesc. So get the right one from a place with faster shipping times and change it ;)
You can find a picture of the correct version somewhere in the thread. Check that with the one you want to purchase to get the right one.

Thats the point it looks right as the one in the thread :)) So it should be the right one :-?? .. no idea now maybe is a bad clone.. idk

last option is to check the modul with an other vesc, but itÂ´s more likely the wrong clone

Hijacking this thread since I seem to have a similar issue. I've got the HM-10 module that @Ackmaniac linked to and have it conected to the FOCBOX (3.3V). 

When scanning for it in the app it doesn't show up, however I can see the Bluetooth device in the phone's bluetooth settings under "available devices". 

With a different phone it shows up in the app.. Is there anything I can do to make it work on this phone?

not all phones have BLE tho... what phone are you using ? 

i still wait for the module that ackmaniac linked and hope for the best .. also got 2 focboxes.. let the fun beggin hopefully ill be able to make it work

Thanks. Ble checker said I have ble. I actually got it to kind of work. Removed the app and reinstalled it and then it worked until it lost connection (?) and never found the device.. I erased all data and cache memory in app manager and then it worked again. Hmm.. Don't really know what the problem is and if it's software or hardware related.

well could you walk me through how you hqve it setup and all? i still dont have it running. You need to set the vesc to uart + ppm or it should see the module just by connecting it to the vesc? any more vesc settings exept baud rate?
```

Don't know if vesc was needed to see the device, but I had it setup ppm+uart, baud rate 9600. 

Connected rx-tx tx-rx gnd-gnd vcc-5v. Removed app on my phone and reinstalled it. Restarted the phone and launched the app. If it didn't work try clearing app data and relaunch the app. 

I tried to connect again today and the app doesn't find the device at first. Only when I first erase all app data in android app manager will the app list Bluetooth devices and connect to the HM-10. 

Not the best solution, but the only way I can make it work. Sounds app related, doesn't it @Ackmaniac?

It works fine on the Samsung galaxy s4 and when all app data are deleted on my Sony it works well as long as I don't disconnect... Using that other phone is no solution for me though, so if there's no other fix I'll have to live with either deleting app data before each ride, or just don't use this app. Too bad as it seems to be such a great app! :cry:

I guess you don't get a error message when the module isn't available anymore. Do you stop the app with the home button or by going backwards until the app closes?

Hey i just got the module that Ackmaniac linked and tested. Is working just fine. Thank you very much you are the best.

Now i need to learn how to use it with a dual focbox setup. hopefully it wont be too hard .

Ok. I believe I found the "bug" :smile: I realized the app doesn't list any Bluetooth devices unless gps is  turned on on the phone. As soon as gps is on, the BT devices show in the app! ðŸ˜‚ Thanks for the troubleshooting though!

Did you connect it correct to the vesc? 5V,  rx tx crossed and a baudrate of 9600? And you can also try to restart your smartphone.

Yes, all the wiring is correct. It seemed to work after I re uploaded your firmware but it has since gone unresponsive to the remote.

The light doesn't turn blue when I pull the trigger and the motor doesn't spin. It did spin for the FOC detection though.

Hello.
I would like to use the Ackmaniac App.. I have a original metr.at bluetooth module which is detected by the App but all values will only display zero.
I get no error message when I connect however - but it will not show anything, no real time data etc. everything is only zero.

Can anyone help me out ?
I got the newest Ackmaniac Firmware on my VESC.

Have a good day

Did you set the UART speed to 9600 baud?
```

---
## \#41 Posted by: RyuX Posted at: 2018-04-13T15:45:45.689Z Reads: 127

No because the metr.at bluetooth module instruction said I should keep it at 115200 baud. I will try to set it lower this evening. But a Side Note which is strange - the metr.at App also is not working (not displaying values) however I thought that could be because of the ackmaniac firmware that I run..

The @Ackmaniac android app requires 9600, I'd start there

If you're running Android O that could be the problem. I haven't gotten either the metr app or ack app running on O yet. I've had to revert to Android N.

Connect it to 5V and RX on Vesc to TX on module and TX on vesc to RX on module. Then you need a mode with uart. For example ppm with uart and a baudrate of 9600.

Ahh man you are a saint.. I accidently thought that UART is always active.. so PPM + UART Mode fixed it.. even though I run 115200 bauds. Now both your App and the Metr.at app will work.. super happy.
Will i have problems with 115200 bauds though ? It looks like it works ?

Thanks again man

One thing I wonder is how can I make the selected mode permanent ?
I would like to have a Slow Mode permanently when selected. But when I turn off and on the VESC then it will be back to default ?
Would be great to have it in the VESC permanently..

For default use the same settings as you use for your "slow mode" and make an additional "fast mode", problem solved. 

It is normal that the vesc goes in default mode after restart.

Isn't it that when you long press a mode it asks if you want this to be written to your vesc as your default mode?
