Iâ€™ve got a 12S 5a charger that has 220v input if you can use it. I was accidentally sent the wrong model charger

What was wrong with this post yesterday where multiple people answered your question?

What was wrong is that no one answered the question. 

@thebeardedboy Look in aliexpress, for example [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32812225540.html?productId=32812225540&productSubject=50-4V-5A-5-5A-6A-6-5A-7A-7-5A-8A-8-5A-9A-Electric&spm=a2g0s.12269583.0.0.5d7d46b1pqT7mn) is one but it has higher current and voltage than what you need. Search for `42V 5A`

As others have said you need to make sure other parts of your equipment will handle the charger or it could be dangerous. 

I'm also interested in finding a 5.5*2.1mm charge port that will handle 8A

I believe you, I once got out of a 115mph speeding charge for a 2L 1978 Citroen CX, the manual stated it's top spped was 110mph, this is very relevant to the max amperage that a 5.5mm jack can take

You need a different charger for the 6s or you need to make a drok(lab) charger that you can adjust the voltage on, see these some may have instructions

That's `5.5x2.5` and not `5.5x2.1`. I found this one which looks similar but I'm not able to find the rating of this plug: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07K569KG3/ref=ask_ql_qh_dp_hza?th=1

[/quote]

read up more... the battery wouldnt be... its max would be 16amp if youre crazy/hardcore but really the only limiter beside the cells would be either the bms... or the actual charge wires and/or connector between the charge wires and port
