Hey was just woundering if i could replace my TB caps with one big cap eaualivent to the 3 small capacitor?

I'm trying to save space for a mini build and I know that the original vesc design used one big cap. If I can links, anyoneðŸ˜…

You can peruse digikey and find one that's ***at least*** 63V and ***approximately*** 2mF

The three 680Î¼F are 2.04mF in parallel like that.

Was gonna tag you but i was scared... Also is these a certin kind of cap to look for? any name brands?

i think your going to have a hard time finding a capacitor rated for 2.04mF and 63V.
Also @b264 what's the tolerance on these 10%?

I was thinking maybe going for more uf as there more common

Will this work?: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0188FWIFS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

[/quote]

Typically, yes.  5% or 10%

Some are like -5% +25%

6800Î¼F / 6.8mF  63V will work fine if you use a loopkey.  If you use an antispark switch without a separate precharge resistor, you will [roast your antispark](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vedder-antispark-design-problem-or-implementation-problem/77967/4?u=b264).

You might want to put an additional 10Î¼F 63V in parallel with that 6.8mF capacitor.

hehe already roasted 2 antisparks and dont know why.

these maybe or can you recommend one?

That one would work if it's not fake.  For $1.29, it's probably fake.

Just use digikey or mouser

Easy enough. its 20% and 2200uf dont know what the 20% means though
https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/nichicon/UVR1J222MHD/493-1130-ND/588871

and you mentioned something about a mcu, thats what multiple vendors told me too, without one all antisparks will have the same fate.

Sure.  You might want to put an additional 10Î¼F 63V in parallel with that.

That's a question for the other thread

why? also whats a safe company for caps, Nichicon, rubycon? also i should get a cap that last a long time in terms of hours?

Capacitors are pretty low-tech, not sure any is better than the other.  I'm sure the more you spend, you will probably get better stuff.

what the 20% means though

the 20% means the Farad rating can be of by +or- 20%

hehe lol i feel stupid now. why 10Î¼F 63V in parallel with that though?

```
The frequency response of capacitors is highly dependant on the capacitance and the 10Î¼F will smooth out high-frequency ripples that the larger one may be quick enough to smooth over.  Increasing from 680Î¼F to 6.8mF means you've lost some of the high-speed response, so that gets it back.

im not going with the 6.8mf cap anymore im going with a 63v 2.2mf cap which sould be the same rating as vedder used

```
The 10Î¼F won't hurt even so you are decreasing the response slightly with one big versus 3 smaller ones.  But not as much as if you went to a single 6.8mF

i cant fit it in my small build lol. im tight for space and ive settled on rubycon

The 10Î¼F is slightly bigger than a rice grain.  You can certainly omit it.  It's advice, you don't need to heed it.  It's also not a terribly important piece.

alright gonna do it than but im gonna need to find a way to connect the caps

and thanks for the help @b264 @Indiangummy
