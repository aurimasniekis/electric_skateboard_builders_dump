So I think I briefly mentioned this idea the other day, but it was poorly thought out, and I got some time to think about it more and drew up a schematic of things, and hopefully this will be something we can theorize over.

Anway's, I am not a fan of the way we have to connect our VESC's if were going a 2WD, and ESPECIALLY for a 4WD, so I was thinking about better ways we could connect them.

What I've thought of, I basically call a Master (V)ESC Controller.  So assume you are building a 4WD setup.  You connect your battery to all the VESC's, but then you have to connect all the VESC's to one another so they work in sync.  What I talked about the other day was essentially you develop a bit of hardware that has a OS that allows you too designate each VESC to it's corresponding spot.  That's about as far as my mind took me, lol.  That was a bad idea cause I essentially wanted to run all the power through this Master Controller (MC), but that would create a whole bunch of unnecessary issues.  Rather, I thought about it some more today and I wondered if you could just connect your battery to each VESC as you would normally.  Then, setup a 5V UBEC so you can run some extra electronics without blowing them up, lol.  From there, connect the MC, and basically, I imagine something similar to a VESC Tool or similar would be set-up for you to assign each VESC accordingly.  To connect the MC to the VESC's, you would simply connect them all via the "canbus."  So typically when you connect multiple VESC's, you designate one "Master" and the rest the "slave."  What I'm essentially proposing is that this MC be designated as "Master" and all the VESC's be designated as the "slave."  Additionally, from the MC you would also connect your remotes transmitter/receiver so all the VESC's get the signal at the same time from the same source.  It just seems like a must simplier way to control the VESC's in my opinion.  I made a little drawing of this.  It's my first so I am sure I missed a few things, but the overall gist of things can clearly be seen.  So, does anyone this think is something that would be doable, or would it require way too much programming and coding, etc...?

This would work with both 2WD and 4WD since all it would require between the two is having just inputs for each canbus.  For 2WD, just use the rear left and rear right inputs.

I am trying to understand your much "simpler way". You connect a receiver to any of vesc set it as master and use canbus to sync all of them. This is already dead simple. Now you want to introduce another component to do exactly that?

No not a whole seperate VESC, just like some tech that allows you to easily connect to 4 VESC's (this really should just be for 4WD as connecting 2 VESC's is easy as pointed out by @Kug3lis) through the canbus and the remote is connected to this as well, so all the VESC's get the signal at the exact same time and instead of having one master and 3 slaves you could designate front left, front right, rear left, rear right, and maybe that would make the whole traction control thing work better, I dunno.  I just think connecting 4 VESC's the normal way is a hassle is all and I like the idea of them specifically being designated to exactly the position they are at.

Just use 4 receivers.  That way, a failure doesn't bring down your braking ability.  Unless your hand controller fails :stuck_out_tongue:

I don't think so.  I've asked about that before and basically was told you are supposed to connect them via the canbus.  easy enough for just 2, but if you have for  then you having to split a bunch...  And what if your master VESC goes out?  All your VESC's would stop working.  If it was set up the way I'm proposing, I think the three other wheels would still keep going, but you would probably notice the difference, so you could stop and check it out, as opposed to getting flung from your board cause they all stopped working.

So basically a 1 in x out splitter for PPM and Serial Data for the VESCs? Just use an Arduino for that, it could be done with a bit of coding. But i don't see any immediate benefits over CAN. You're just moving the failure point, not eliminating it.

True, but I think the ease of setting things up and potential improvement in any traction control, along with the simplicity of the HW/SW i'm suggesting is more beneficial then just keeping the potential failure point.  I feel like this would be less likely to fail, and as I said, I think it also has some benefits as well, so to me at least it seems worth it.

For selling, I don't know it would be too expensive for the general public, as it would have way too much thing for simple people ;) I going to connect each vesc via uart/ppm/usb to the main board. Also there will be usb hub on board so I would only need to plug one usb to the board for BMS, Vesc's and main controller ;)

Well, I have idea of controlling each motor individually so I could accomplish really tight turns on my eMtb by braking one wheel and spinning another that way I could make decent 90ยบ turns with ease. Of course only on low speed and it also would require CH2 or as I will use my own remote some kind of button/thumb control to make it work.

Look if you want a simple solution, setup all of the escs as Masters and slaves.

For example use "multiple esc over can" on every esc, and "send status" on every esc. As well setup ppm on every esc.. hook all esc up to a canbus chain.

For 4wd install a 4 way switch, wire the ppm from each esc to the 4 way switch. If your main master dies switch to a different position. Or setup the 4 way switch as channel 2 on the remote so you can switch masters by remote.

It's already simple....alot of your suggestions seem overcomplicating something simple...

What would be a 4 way switch?  Is a canbus chain just 4 of the wires where there all spliced in series?  I don't know that seems like it could fail easily too, plus, the signal is not being received at the same time but each one gets it after the preceeding.  LOL sorry don't mean to over-complicate things, though I know I tend to do that :blush:

You know what a 2 way and 3 way switch are? ..you can get 4 way 5 way and ,6 way switches ...

From the 4WD Master

[quote="BigBoyToys, post:60, topic:34656"]
4wd CAN: Same as 2wd CAN setting but with additional slaves. All are connected by a daisy chain can harness, and with different CAN IDโs.

It works, but doesnt seem robust. Ive tried 4wd CAN,  4wd split PPM, 4WD communication/tuning via CAN but control via ppm and front CAN with rear CAN connected via PPM. Still seemed to be plauged with random CAN tranceiver failures.  I gave up on CAN and split ppm for 4wd setups. It was suggested that connecting 4 vescs in parallel lowers the resistance on the can bus circuit too much, but I donโt know if this was confirmed. I just run 4 receivers now and havent had a single vesc failure since.

I don't know why but I can't think of what you mean by a 4 way switch...?

Canbus would be so much easier for 4WD if they had a canbus in, and canbus out you could plug into, rather then having to splice wires.

And I could probably figure out a way to connect the receiver to that also...

If you look at quadcopters typically there's an esc for each motor, and a flight controller sends control signals to them via digital protocol.

The interesting idea being the brainbox and dumb escs talking via some protocol.
```

---
## \#39 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-03-24T23:28:49.978Z Reads: 56

See..

That works for quadcopters because the flight controller is centralized has a gyroscope and is sending signals to each esc to keep it stabilized at x angle. So it can fly. They are synchronous based on the gyroscope. In skateboards there is no gyroscope. But traction of all four wheels

Then benefits of having a "brain" are already implemented into the vesc, canbus allows the 2 wire communication, and provides the traction control. Any vesc can be the brain. If we are asking for a smarter traction control, where canbus IDs = motor corner location. You could implement torque vectoring. But again, each vesc Is already a brain in it's own right. I setup all my vesc as Masters and slaves, if something ever arises in the field, just swap ppm or uart pins and keep riding.

I have a 4WD with 4 Vescs, and I use this to split the remote signal:

![IMG_0570|375x500](upload://eo4krFz1kYNxYOQf6mfcuPJuM5Q.jpg)

That has been very reliable.  I've not messed with telemetry so far, but I'm planning on putting an HM-10 on every VESC, as well.  That might be overkill, but I never had any luck with the CAN back when I was trying.

I hear what you're saying, but I can see benefits of splitting it up the control from the escs.

- lower unit cost per esc (and per motor)
- one receiver, no debate about split ppm or self frying canbus (especially with 3 or more vesc?)
- with one brain, easier to get logging/telemetry
- again, with one brain, there's one source of truth for things like brake lights
- less chance to fumble finger and put different configs on control units

I'm leaving traction control out of this, as at least with canbus, I've not liked it at all. if one vesc is cogging, the other one stops hard, etc.

Oh and I'm just thinking out loud, not really advocating anything.

You talking about running all 4 motors from single MCU? Because VESC MCU spends 90% of time working on controlling motor and just fraction of checking can/ppm/uart/usb.

So there is not much way to split control from VESC to single mcu

I think the "dumb" escs for quads have an MCU, after all they talk to the flight controller via some control protocol (newer ones use a digital protocol). So it's like the motor control is offloaded to the escs.

So the "master" MCU decides what to do, and the "dumb" MCUs on the ESCs execute the commands.

Does this mean you agree with me?  Lol
[/quote]

Lol I'm not sure if I agree with you. But I think it's an idea with merit, and probably not for the BV vesc. Are you gonna make it happen? ;)

EDIT I think dshot is the popular FC -> ESC digital protocol. From a 30 second read, it seems like a 11 bit throttle value with a 4 bit checksum. Not bidirectional, and not that fancy.

Okay this got my brain going a little.

I'm not familiar with the space, but 30A dshot ESCs seem to be around $15. 4 x 30a is 120a, so I guess that's plenty for typical use.

VESC is 50A so the power section would have to scale up, but the control section would probably remain the same? The quads are running way higher KV motors, so I'd guess they have much higher sampling rates, etc?

If the ESCs are separate from the brains, there's less risk of one of the common failure modes of VESC -- something like frying the DRV chip.

Eh, I like the idea of this more and more.

@uigiroux no offense, but why are you making multiple topics everyday...?  Most of the things you make NEW topics about are covered somewhere (there is tons of stuff on board security, one of your new topics from yesterday for example).

Might I suggest starting a build thread so you can put these thoughts there instead of spamming new topics?  I mean I know its exciting and all, but you don't need to recreate the wheel quite yet... 

Once again, not to offend, but it is a little annoying.  Maybe just try a different tactic. Like finding a similar thread and posting your thoughts/ideas there.  The more new redundant topics we have the more all this knowledge and insight gets spread out and difficult to search.

I dunno, maybe I am just in a bad mood.

Ok well I guess the board security one I could have added to another thread, but I think I've made I'm total over the past year less then 20 posts.  I don't know what thread I could have added this too so I think this one is fine, and aside from the board security one, the last topic I made was a hub motor in a pneumatic tire, which I didn't see any when I made the thread.  I do typically look first before adding a new topic.  Sorry about the board security if that upset you... but as for the majority of my new posts I think I have been good about either adding too an existing topic, and if one can't be found then I'll make a new post.

As for making a build thread I think that would be pointless, mainly because I still waiting on the things I've ordered so I can hardly start one of those, and a lot of the times, a topic I bring up would have nothing to do with a build thread, but more to do with learning about certain things that I didn't find a sufficient answer in the current threads when searched.

Also, a thread should have one topic to be discussed.  If I was to make a thread and just start throwing new topics in there it would be very confusing and I'd probably have an admin come and tell me to stay on topic.  So I don't know what is so annoying about this, as it's a place for learning.   I'll be sure to be extra vigilant in the future and make sure only to post new topics if not a single thing else can be found, if that will make you happy... :wink:

Has anyone tried getting rid of R401 for 4WD builds on the VESC? The CAN network is usually terminated with 120 Ohm resistors. On the VESC schematic CANH and CANL are already connected with 100 Ohm so for a 2WD it's therefore to spec, but 4WD has now 2 resistors too many.

```
The first VESC Six design Benjamin made had two CAN bus ports, so that you could have plugged in two cables, forwarding the CAN signal to the next VESC. We skipped that design, since you don't really need that feature in reality. Soldering an external parallel Y-Splitter for CAN is simple enough.... 

A brain, controlling all the attached ESCs is somehow nonsense for this kind of application, since each VESC is a brain already. The MCU is needed on each device anyway and it has plenty computational resources left to handle some other tasks in addition. This is why there is an App section in the software.

On a 4WD you have 4brains already, why implement a 5ths? If that device fails, you would be struggling to get home. If the master ESC fails, you could simply re-configure another ESC to be master and ride home on 3 driven wheels. If you build your board in a way, so that you can plug in your receiver into one of the other devices you will have fall back strategy. 

If the Hardware is made to a nice spec, it usually doesn't fail during a ride and there is no problem that needs to be addressed by making things more complicated than needed. The likelihood that your 5ths brain fails is as high as the likelihood that your master ESC fails.
