# Can VESC use input from a standard RF receiver that is getting signal from a transmitter on an Arduino?

Hi All,

I've seen a few videos and how-to tutorials where people connect to the VESC using a wireless nunchuk controller. Basically, the wireless RF receiver is just plugged into the VESC input port and the VESC tool can be configured to interpret the incoming signal.

I'm hoping to make an Arduino-based controller, but I don't know what is required on the VESC side of things. 

Has anyone succeeded doing something similar with a signal transmitted from an Arduino? 

Can I just plug in a simple RF receiver and receive serial data through the PPM port?

Can I use a transceiver instead of receiver?

Any advice appreciated, thanks!
