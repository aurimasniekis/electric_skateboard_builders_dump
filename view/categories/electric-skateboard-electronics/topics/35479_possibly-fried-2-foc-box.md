I accidentally hooked up  2 foc box using  series connector instead of a parallel connector. Everything seemed ok until I used the remote to accelerate. There was a quiet pop. I cant find any damage inside, but they are not working. bldc does not connect. no lights red or blue. Are these things toast or are they fixable?

Please post some pictures. Are you sure the VESC’s are getting power? Sounds like a fried connector to me.

There is a light on the remote receiver that comes on. This will work with both focs when i switch it over. What pics can I post?

I just wanted to see the connectors but it dosnt look like that’s it. I’d call on @JohnnyMeduse I have never connected vesc’s In series by accident so don’t know the outcome.

Did you check the fuse that leads to the BMS? It sounds like that blew

I was under the same situation last weekend:

Nha send them in I could probably make them work again, They just need a little bit of affection and some Isopropyl to clean them. :laughing:

Are you getting any blinking lights? I’m thinking a reboot will fix the problem.

Maybe we could ask @trampa but I think the new firmware from Vedder could fix the issue.

Why so pessimistic. Still looks good to me. You should isolate the blank CAN wires. When they touch the CAN might get damaged. Also looks like a solid bluetooth module integration.
