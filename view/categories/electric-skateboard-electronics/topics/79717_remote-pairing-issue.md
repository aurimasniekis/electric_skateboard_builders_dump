When I tried pairing the remote to the master vesc, the light signals that it has connected, but the motor won't turn. I had this same issue back when I was pairing my remote for a single motor, and I somehow fixed it(forgot how exactly maybe by adjusting motor settings?). I was wondering if yall could help me?

Here are the links to the videos for my vesc config and setup:

Did you "write" your configs before disconnecting?

So in your master input video you didn't set the parameters for the trigger.

When yoyou get here, you need to full throttle. Don't worry it won't turn the motors. So, full throttle then pull back to full brake. Then hit apply

sorry, one last question. I thought that after one motor runs with the controller that after connecting both vesc via canbus, both motors should work with the remote?
```

## \#15 Posted by: yanggatang Posted at: 2019-01-03T05:33:13.816Z Reads: 38

```
because right now, only one motor is turning when I flip the remote after connecting both vesc via canbus?

Did you set the second vesc as slave?
You need to configurate the second vesc too.

You also made motor detection on the slave and still only one is responding when moving the trigger?

For the slave input setup, there wasn't the option to test the ppm brake and acceleration like on the master on the VESC tool.

Not the ppm. I speak about the motor wizard.
Did you go through it on the slave too?
Will have a look in the videos later. On the way to airport right now ðŸ˜…

Ok, two things that went wrong.
First is that the remote is not centered, but I think this you fixed already, right?
Second, I donâ€™t see any CAN cable which connect the both vescs.

I have fixed the remote config and after that I connected the CAN cable when one motor worked

```
So currently the master motor works and the slave doesn't even when connected via canbus. Should i go split ppm?
```

```
The settings look right.
Did you try to do a new set up with CAN connected? Maybe some settings havenâ€™t been saved out of a reason I donâ€™t know ðŸ˜…
If thatâ€™s not work, split ppm would be an option, but you need to setup both vescs as master than.

You need to reboot both VESC's after the can bus cable is connected.
