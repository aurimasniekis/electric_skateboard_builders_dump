Hey all, I've recently finished building a space cell from Enertion but I've found that even when the battery is turned off, I still get a reading of around 1.5V from the XT60 connector. Does anyone else get this? 
Might be worth mentioning that my battery uses the more recent BMS.

Yes, I have a first gen space cell and get around 1.5-3v nominal when turned off. 

It's completely normal, and not enough to power on your ESC
