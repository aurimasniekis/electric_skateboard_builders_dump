Issue To Resolve PLEASE:
When I pull the trigger the motor JOLTS for millisecond then stops, and then I need to wait like 2 long seconds before the trigger will work again.

If I pull the trigger REALLY REALLY SLOW..... the motor will work and I have full throttle spectrum control and can rev motor up and down really fast no problem...

How to eliminate the sensitivity JOLT & LONG PAUSE before vesc will allow new trigger input?

I did setup the remote to get speed and trigger all working nicely with some great help from this forum, now I'm just down do this little issue so I can have smoother riding.

Im using VESC 4.12
