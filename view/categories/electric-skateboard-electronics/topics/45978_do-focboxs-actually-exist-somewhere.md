SO I finally decided to try these things out and get a pair and I go to find some and it seems they are just a figment of my imagination. Even the stores that have the big "IN STOCK NOW!" banners and stuff don't have them when you reach the product page...is there a problem with the supply? Too much demand? are we waiting on a kickstarter or something? And does anyone have an alternative because I need some VESC's...

All of he foc boxes are supplied by enertion. Yes the demand is above supply and supply is running short due to some electrical components.  You just have to wait for the next batch ⏱

They're also out of stock... the Only thing you can find is CUT TAPE package, which is useless for any machinery.

And BTW I think they bought the last rolls. And production should go on at the end of CNY

Well, I'm pretty sure they don't own the PCB assembly factory, and I'm pretty they don't buy any part but a whole assembly, so if the factory didn't go forward and told that they were missing part it hard to put the screwup on Enertion. 

Also, you might not know, but China is pretty secretive which mean that if something bad happen your only aware of it at the last possible minute and they don't always tell you the truth especially regarding production capability and defective ratio.

The only reason am saying this was because he said he had stock ready to ship 500focbox and then cybermonday came and we know the rest he explained what had happened u could say but as big as the company they are still to be beheld accountable and get the job done at there own expense. they mest up to begin with for  them to  go  the were not going to loose profit out of this and go the long exstravegent way path.

Hi Everyone 

With the new logistics, it's really difficult to catch up things. They are still in learning process and constantly getting improved. 

I know some of the customer's didn't received their money clip with their orders (even after getting all the stuff delivered). Please contact Enertion Support via Email for the inquires so we will look over it and fulfill which is missing. Email is support@enertionboards.com

For FOCBOXes and NANO-Xes, we have shipped a bulk to our US and UK Team for stocking, Lead time is 1-4 working days hopefully (used express shipping). After the delivery of the products to them, we will resume shipping orders (with FOCBOXes and NANO-Xes only) to our US and UK customers, This will also reduce the delivery timing and there will be no extra shipping charges (Customs Duty). 

The rest of the orders will be shipped by Early March hopefully (After the Chinese Holiday in FEB). Orders including wheels etc.

We will never miss any of our customer, we might be late but we will deliver to each and every customer for sure :slight_smile:

You need to bequiet  if you know nothing @ZackoryCramer, half of the vendors are a small company operate as a one man army, Enertion  is no "small company " by any stretch of imagination, the major problem was that they stated they had stock when cyber Monday hit which was false.

I'm feeding them slack all the time and I know that in the end I will get my stuff.
However.
I am a teensy bit sore about specifically being told that there were 500 units of focbox in stock before the sale.
I got up early and got my order in some of the first ones.
Now, two months later they are saying that they've shipped 400..
I understand they were fed false info but it still stings.

I have 17 backorders with another 30 on order. as soon as they arrive they'll all go out in the same day and i'll probably be ordering even more to get ahead of it. 

I have several orders that are for far more than just focboxes and are waiting on just those to ship. 

One guy bought almost everything i have including a battery and enough shit for two other boards. 

I need them for retail and for builds and i need them yesterday, but i suppose we're all going to have to wait for CNY now. 

once they start flowing though it won't be a problem. This is all just because of a badly timed shakeup that happened in close proximity to CNY. 

fucking sucks but what are you gonna do.

Feel pissed for you guys. Maybe one day enertion will learn. @onloop really fooled us, gave us number of units that were in stock ready to ship. Then lies over lies + a touch of marketing bs with the moneyclip ( we really swallowed that ?) 
Anyway I can't much complain because I recieved my order 1 month ago ( 1 month and half late). But i've been buying stuff from enertion for almost 2 years now and it's always been the same story. they have improved their game in many ways but not on this one.

See the good in this situation : that's how enertion was built and managed to deliver FOCBOX in the first place. Should they not have, there's no telling if anybody would have been able to ever ride FOCBOXes in the first place. Note that FOCBOX orders have been honored one way or another, that's better than running away with your money.

WTF, did **angry me** just _praise_ enertion ? Office is really boring today. Gotta go lunch.

@CarlCollins what will be the country of origin for these shipments? 

Also, i couldn't help but notice that the 25th is in "two weeks." That's a very thinly disguised "two weeks" response, sir. Its also on a Sunday, but i have to assume since you guys are like 19 hours ahead of us you mean Monday. 

Just fuck the money clips. Seriously. I called around and got everyone that gives a fuck about the money clips and we took this group shot:

@longhairedboy

We will be shipping some of the FOCBOXes and NANO-Xes from US & UK. Items were already dispatched to our Agents, they will be shipping them by this week hopefully (limited February stock).
We will be getting more items by the end of this month hopefully. 
The massive shipments will be by End of February-Early March 2018. 

Also, We are ignoring money clips to expedite the shipment. If any of the customer missed that and want it, please email to the support to get them when they will be in our warehouse. 

The Delay is due to Chinese holiday. Sorry for the inconvenience.

So at first you guys couldn't ship our orders because the money clip wasn't available yet. Then the perfectly timed "company breakdown". Then this. Then that. Now your skipping the money clip? Lol. Holy fuck dudes. Please get your shit together. I'll continue to wait. Hopefully I'll see my shit soon. I mean, I did work hard for that money I gave you guys.

It appears this company needs to set realistic and honest expectations in the future. I didn't mean to start this chaos, I just want to try an esc, other than the hobbyking and torqueboards. At this point, reading all this, I'm gonna skip the focbox for now and jumped on the b box..I thought getting some focboxes, would be helping the community and getting the good stuff, but at this point I'd be on list 4 and frankly I don't know if they are worth the trouble, its easier at this point to support the next fictional esc, lol, the experience and expectations are the same..

Conveniently you now have nowhere to put the money you gave them. See? Everything seems to be working out. 

Maybe i should look into fiberglass money clips since they won't block the remote signal.

I would like to ask how much do you ship a day? 1? 5? Of FoxBox'es or wtf if you really have stock to ship? 100 units is a joke, my father was able to ship even more in two days using plain shipping methods working alone so please dont joke around. 3 months not even able to ship. Other countries will have to wait for another month just to get shipped? What are you trying to fool here I would like to ask?

You guys are fun just ignoring your local law regarding preorder refunds.
Fortunately the procedure for this kind of situation is clearly explained on your government website: a service (in this case a preorder) can be cancelled if

1 provided with an unacceptable level of care and skill
2 unfit for the purpose you asked for
3 not delivered within a reasonable time when there is no agreed end date.
Suppliers should give any refund IN THE SAME as your original payment.

I just blew about 5 thousand dollars on eskate parts and have a crap ton of work to do now, enertion didn't get any of it sadly, I cannot trust a company that doesn't deliver on the expectations they set with the community....they don't have to jump through flaming hoops and wash my dishes or anything, but they should at least deliver on their words. I think I'm begging to become a part of this story by entertaining the idea of buying one...I would rather not experience what others here are talking about, no thanks..I am not an investor, I am a skater...if it ain't on the shelf and able to be handed to me, don't bother trying to sell it to me or blowing smoke up my ass for kickstarter funds...companies that sell you things they do not actually have are earning interest on your money...when you could be earning that interest or blowing your funds elsewhere for a more instant gratification...Customer service is not about being nice and saying nice things, it's about the customer experience and being honest...having a great product is one thing, but buying it shouldn't be excruciating..


I asked a friend and owner of a giant FPV company the other day about one of his products and if I should consider it. He told me to go buy another brand for what I needed...THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  Some of what I am reading is borderline slimy...

Order #15246.  Set an alarm for 5am or so be up before the sale started so I could be towards the start of the line.
Good thing too otherwise I could have been one of the ones still waiting months later.
I even managed to get the Focbox added to my cart before I wen't to bed so all I had to do was check out and pay.
