hi iam new and want to build my first esk8.
i want to build a dual belt drive with 2 6374 motors what is the best way to mount this sice it doesnt fit side by side on a caliber || fifty 10"  i have seen a couple of options.
1. metroboard style (one motor on the rear heel side and one on the front toe side)
2. boosted + evolve style ( one motor under the board like boosted and one on the outside like evolve)
3. one close to the truck and one a bit further out .
4. use mountainboard trucks with normal wheels (14 inche )
if you have anny other ideal also pleas let me know

It depends what you want and how you will be using it.

If skating in rain or snow is on the agenda, I would suggest dual diagonal.

Otherwise, if you want a narrow truck, I would not use 6374 and use 6355 instead.  But all the options you listed work, just depends what you want.

no my reason iam using dual 6374 is because i want to start with single drive and when i saved a bit more money i want to add a second motor.

That's legit.

Dual diagonal makes a lot of sense then.

Yes; I would put the first motor on the rear heelside.
