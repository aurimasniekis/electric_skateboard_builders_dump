Anyone gotten their hands on one yet? If so, wht was your order number like? I'm in Canada and am curious as to when I would be able to receive it if I ordered one today. I really want one by end of July even if it means extra shipping. Is the dream possible?

Is it handed to Canada post when entering canada? Under shopping it just says "free shipping".I don't mind paying extra to get ups or purlator. I have Canada post with a passion. Could a fellow Canadian give me some insight on this?

They both use the same enclosure; however, the pro 4 uses more space inside the enclosure leaving less space for VESCs and the remote receiver

@Dmsj97 the pro4 is also 10s but with more cells in parallel. That's what it says on the website. Where'd you see it is 12s? o.O
Also, how long did it take to ship to you once it left the Texas dispatcher?

I hope the pro4 has enough space for dual VESC and a receiver

Shipping from the factory this weekend?? Aw man. They told me this on July 1st: "The SPACE CELL Pro 4 have been manufactured and are now being sent from the Battery Factory to the Battery Logistics Company.

As you are based in the US the battery will be sent out from our US based Distributor once they clear it through customs, this process from factory to your door is overly complicated for batteries and can take somewhere between 7-20 days. 

As soon as we get your tracking number we will update you. Thanks for your Patience."

It came with mounting hardware some rivets and screws, i drilled a hole in the deck then hammered the rivets in place then i put the battery under the deck lined up the holes and used the screws it came with.

Here's what they told me when I asked about pro4 shipping to Canada:

We have just had confirmation that the Space Cell Pro 4 batteries will commence shipping from the factory on the weekend. We recommend you allow 7-10 business days for delivery.

Not too sure what the 7-10 days is exactly. Like from the NA location to me? Or from factory to NA? Or combined time of both? Maybe I'm missing something here but the answer is really ambiguous.
Halp.

Apparently 'shipped' can also mean 'package is moving to our NA dispatcher and there won't be a concrete date on when the package will arrive at the dispatcher and no idea when it's gonna be sent from dispatch to actually reach your doorstep'

That's what I have gotten from the forums and some support chats. So 'shipped' status means nothing to me right now.

> Thank you for your valued inquiry.

> We are currently working hard shipping out orders. All outstanding orders will have been shipped by the end of the month. You will receive tracking information as soon as your order has been shipped.

> We are sorry we can not give you more detailed information at this time.

> Regards,

I'm assuming they're busy catching up on orders, so they don't have much time for emails.

Thank you for your valued order 
Your VESCs should be sent in the next few days. As for your battery, all batteries for US/Canadian customers have been shipped to our US agent but there have been some delays with chargers to go with them. You shall receive a tracking number for your battery within 10 business days.

[/quote]

Sorry, I can't tell you dates, days, or time because i don't know...I suppose i could make something up, but i prefer to be honest.. they will arrive i just don't know when.

based on logic, It should arrive in the US any day now, shipping batteries from country to country is really complex these days, i have explained the process many times. It just takes time. It involves many middle men... it's a slow & annoying process...

As enertion grows bigger we will start shipping via sea freight, but we are just a bit too small to do that at the moment.

The package also took an interesting route. It went into canada to clear customs then went back out again?? Anyone know why lol

SPACE CELL PRO still has an element of DIY included, you will need soldering irons & wires & connectors.... & glue & patience & time....

**it's like a 90% shortcut to making your own ESk8 the 10% is up to you.**

6 out of 8 screws are ok. It's just the end that kinda iffy. I think I could just mount it on anyways. Some of the screw may be exposed but it won't really be much of an issue.... Unless someone has a better idea lol :p

The cells don't have spacers. They instead sit in the grooves of the ABS enclosure. It's a very tight squeeze with 2 VESCs and a receiver in there. I've been getting signal drop out issues and am currently trying to find the mos optimal position for the receiver.

I have found in my own boxes that the receiver should be towards the front of the board and away from all that crazy high freq high powered switching in the VESCs, but i guess you can't really do that in these. The raptors aren't built that way either, receivers are just crammed in there next to the caps. I guess the difference made in placement depends on the individual quality of the receivers. I've had some that i can control from almost 30 feet away and some that drop signal at 6 to 8 feet. That's actually been the source of some of my pain recently. 

Sorry, its a pro3 i have. I'm a very tired man.

Yea. I noticed my other receiver would freak out when the chaka aluminum heatsink touched the antenna, or if the phase wires got close to it. Right now my receiver is next to the caps, but I've been debating about mounting it outside the enclosure. It seems to have signal issues no matter where I mount it in there.

Ugh so on my way to work, it started throttling on it's own, sometimes to full speed. I turned off the remote and it **continued** to throttle itself a couple times. I couldn't get it to throttle by itself with the remote off after that though.

I know for sure the canbus cable came loose as only 1 motor was spinning, but i'm not sure if that's why it was throttling itself either. I'm not sure if the slave or master VESC was throttling.

Also can a mod please split this topic to "Winning remote issues"?

The charger charges the space cell up to 42,3V
How much does this reduce the cycle count of this battery?

Can I use the Evolve Charger that stops at 41,8V?

Oh, man I confused this thread for the reddit thread asking if a guy could use a 43.2v lifepo4 charger on a 10s li-ion pack. LOL

You could use a 41.8v charger and just leave it in normally, same as a 42v charger. No idea why the Evolve charger would be rated at 41.8v. My GT charger is 42.3v.

The BMS will handle protection of the cells, no need to worry.

So due to the dense nature of the components in the space cell pro 4 while running dual VESCs, careful consideration needs to be taken. I've had a bunch of signal issues due to EMI, or high current noise. This caused my remote to cut out a couple times and made me eat it. 

I've also noticed that sometimes my slave VESC would fail to respond during and immediately after high current riding. This resulted in reduced torque and braking ability. It also caused the slave VESC to respond in a laggy manner. I would throttle and the master VESC would respond, but the slave VESC takes the command 1 second later or not at all. Sometimes this would mean my board is throttling forward when my finger is off the controller. I believe this is due to  EMI creating noise in the CAN bus cable. 

If you're considering running a similar setup (dual VESC) I'd highly consider investing in some ferrite rings to reduce the noise on the CAN bus and receiver cables. I currently have a large ring (posted above) that has both cables going through it (not shown in picture). I have tested this momentarily and my problems seem to be resolved but it is definitely too early to confirm. I will ride more this weekend to test it out.

I'm using dual chaka VESC's with the 2.4 ghz remote (the mini one that still has a wheel on the side not the "winning" one) and I haven't had any connection problems so far. The wheels spin almost synchronously with minor lag. I don't even have traction control on, mainly because I don't know how to set it up correctly so I'd rather not mess it up

The lag issues I've been having seem to be only during and immediate after high current scenarios such as a deep incline or lots of dead stop torque. My parallel connector also sits right next to my CANbus cable, so I'm sure it depends on how you lay everything out.

Ferrite rings are never a bad idea though!

Why would it lag only after high current use? Doesn't the noise dissipate when the current stops? What you wrap some aluminium foil around the wires to better isolate them?

That's what the ferrite rings are for.

I'm not sure why it lags during/after high current usage, but I imagine the noise is somehow suppressing or blocking the signal for a small amount of time? Not sure on the science behind it.

Tell me about it. Yesterday I went up a pretty steep and long hill, then when I was going down only my master vesc/motor was braking. I was wondering why my braking seemed so weak. 

Before that I started accelerating with my remote OFF right next to a cop, but that was due to a loose can bus cable :P

I'm not really sure. I had a big open space where the motor wires ran through my enclosure and I happen to run through a small bit of water and a little bit of it got on the vesc, but nothing happened immediately. Then, my dumbass thought it would be fine to push on the throttle repeatedly. When I did that, the vesc stopped functioning correctly. It would move the motor normally, then stop with the red LED and give the DRV error. This would happen when I fully let off throttle or if I'm on the board. I did another motor detection and the error went away. So I figured it would be good enough to put the space cell on. That was not the case, as it would still shut off. Then at one point, it stuttered as I was riding, and the motor would not turn, as if the phase wires were shorted. I tried another ESC to check the motor and it was fine. 

Don't know what happened, but its dead now.

I've had my SCP4 for about a week now but I've had to deal with a few setbacks in order to get my DIY build going. The space cell itself came with a faulty switch, so I had to remove the broken one with pliers and solder on a new switch that did work. Also had some trouble configuring my gt2b RX to the VESC I ordered from Enertion. But despite all that, my board is working great now and I plan on doing some testing tomorrow in SF. Right now I've got 83mm wheels and the 6374 big boy motor from Enertion hooked up to my pro4. I'm gonna go for distance and see how far I go! I'll let you guys know what kind of range this thing has.

Try adding a ferrite ring to the receiver cable and moving the receiver away from the mosfets and phase wires on the VESCs. If that still doesn't help you can solder on an external antenna on the receiver assuming signal is the issue.
