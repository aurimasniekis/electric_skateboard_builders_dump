Just assembling my build, and after making the CANBUS lead to connect the 2nd FOCBOX as slave, I notice there's a 5V and GND pin either side of the CAN 1 and CAN 2 pins. 

So my question is, what, if anything, do you guys use this output for ?

LEDs, running lights, something else, or nothing (cos it's too risky) ??

What peripherals can be used safely with this port, and if running a Dual setup, is it better to just use one port, from either the Master or Slave, or does it not matter ?

Cheers
Tony
