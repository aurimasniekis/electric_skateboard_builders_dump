I just found these on ebay: [Magnetic adapters to convert from Flat to Button Top](http://www.ebay.de/itm/5-Battery-Magnet-Spacer-Convert-from-Flat-to-Button-Top-18650-18500-18350-26650-/231587475952?hash=item35ebb071f0:g:5p4AAOSwpdpVdaVu)

Does anybody know what kind of current these can handle? Because this could make soldering custom packs even easier and less dangerous - you just solder the wires to the magnet and put it on the battery after all the soldering is done.
Not sure how bad vibrations are for this type of connection though.

Soldering to those magnets would be pretty much impossible. Also the heat would damage the magnet's magnetizing abilities, making it weaker

[Well seems like there are mixed experiences with this type of thing](http://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/showthread.php?239360-can-i-solder-wires-to-magnets-and-attach-magnets-to-battery-for-charging). Not easy but doable - but I guess you are right: the difficulty of this is higher than simply soldering directly. So no reason to actually try.

Yep, the heat will kill those magnets in a hurry. Plus, after they are soldered to the magnets, what will keep the magnets from moving off target? Before you get the solder to stick to the magnet, a piece of metal like that will get super hot.  And the whole corrosion/conductivity angle... Too sketchy....
Bite the bullet and get a spot welder. It really is the "right" way to put together a battery pack. Unless you are really a stud at soldering, I would NOT try soldering direct to cell. IMO

Has anyone ever actually had an event related to direct soldering to cells?  I mean here, on this forum.  I know there's anecdotal evidence on the tubes but I'm trying to gauge whether I should go for it or spring the $175 for the eBay spot welder...

Stories?

I got one of my good cells that i own and my old 80W soldering iron and pushed them together behind a small blast shield and had it sit there for 25 minutes, the worst thing that happened was some of the electrolyte leaked out of the top of the cell. That was at the 5 minute mark. The cell was around 350C at that point and later reached 450C. Never exploded.

Nothing dangerous because 18650 cells have a pressure control valve.
But you could easily damage your cells and weaken your pack

Scuff surface, plenty of flux, high wattage to get quick joints. Will do very little damage when done properly

Thanks for the feedback - if my cells ever actually arrive I'm going for it.

Just for fun, I'll test the capacity of the cell before and after.  If there's a significant difference I'll post.

@chaka has said you don't need to scuff the surface since it's a nickel bond

@DougM I was about to solder a 10s4p pack with 18650s and realized as I was getting prepped that it would be 100+ soldered joins to make. I bought the spot welder to save time and to eliminate the risk of damage to the cells.

why would it be better to scrub? i thought the reason you scrub was to remove oxidation which nickel doesn't have normally

Agreed I have soldered a 10s4p pack a bit a go and it was a B.... 

Now I'm working on a 10s8p and I just bout a spot welder because I'm not doing that again especially not double that

Some cells have a coating of stuff on them i have found, not sure what it is. Also, some cells aren't actually nickel, so scrubbing is very helpful.

Even if it is nickel and there is no oxide layer, scuffing the surface can still allow for a quicker and easier made joint. 

I have soldered hundreds of cells over the past year and i am about to solder a crap ton more and i always scruff them with a light sanding wheel on my dremmel. Takes a few seconds per cell.

On 10S4P it should be exactly 80 joints - not 100+. Or am I missing something?

Well, you usually do three pairs of joints per cell (2 at a time because there are 2 electrodes) so for 80 batteries you would have about 240 welds.

EDIT: We are talking about soldering so yes around 80 for the cells but then balancing cables. Now we have 91. Volt meters, on off switch ect.

But voltmeter, balancing cables etc. you can't spot weld anyway - so you would have to solder them no matter what.

It's still a soldering joint you'd have to do. So 90 soldering joints at least.

I know - but the argument in the beginning was that you would want a spot welder because you have more than 100 joints to solder.
Now only 80 of them can actually be replaced by the spot welder - the rest you still have to solder.
That is all I am saying...

@treenutter - You're right, I hadn't thought about it that way - I'm doing, for space reasons, 8s5p, which is 80ish welds.  Might be worth $175 for a machine that does it easily.  Also it's likely this won't be the only pack I do...

@DougM that's my thinking as well... buying a spot welder demarcates my exit from the world of lipos and balance chargers to a new building style where I make my own custom battery packs. -not putting down lipos, I use them currently!

@treenutter and @DougM This model has a known issue with the triac. It can overheat and blow the triac under heavy load and on 110v. It's not a huge deal, but if the triac goes, heres how to fix it:

Oh yeah...No need to scuff the cells if you are soldering. Get a flux pen and give it a little dab. DONE! :wink:
The idea of scuffing over 100 contact points makes me ill!! LOL

@Ulfberht @DougM this is a slightly lower price but shipping is direct from China. The other one is already in Chicago, so I guess it's a matter of how long you want to wait.

FYI: Watch out!! Ameliazhou from "Chicago" is a trick. It's actually going to be drop shipped out of china! I got snagged by that one too. I bought thinking from the US and realized pretty quick through the tracking info where it was coming from. Same avg ship time as any other Chinese stuff I've ordered. I messaged the guy about it and he credited me back $10, so I called it a wash. Good product for sure.

My pleasure, bro! Also keep in mind the strips you get with it are poor quality. 
Another thing I discovered and already posted in the Village build thread was that the strips that come with the spot welder are plated SS and can rust like a mutha! I scuffed and salt water tested em' The strip that comes with the 788 is on the far left.

no not at all. Just pre-tinned them and make sure to use an iron that is pretty high in watts because you want the solder to melt and cool as quick as possible. but the connections are soldered very strong and have better connections than spot welding.
