There were too many posts to check if you had posted in this thread or not. Is this close to what you are looking for?

All I can think of is the nano-x. Mine has been great so far. One annoying thing is having to move the throttle when you turn it on to set the end points. I like it because it's small and will fit in a large mitt with my hand. I'm thinking of one of those ice scraper mitts without the scraper.

Best of luck.

Sorry, no I don't think so. I was thinking of size instead of open source.
