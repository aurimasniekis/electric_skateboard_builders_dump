Hello boys! I got a problem with my electric skateboard. I was out riding and everything was fine then all of a sudden it just "died". 
When i look on the motherboard i find this, which probably is the issue. Picture below. 
My question is do any1 of you know what SMD Capacitor that is? Size, voltage etc. 
Sorry if its a stupid question but Im really newbie on this.
