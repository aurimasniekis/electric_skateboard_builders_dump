The focbox pisses me off and ollin and axle seem to be gone or too busy.   What about this?:
https://www.vandaelectronics.com/
I don't know much about these things but they literally look good and that's something.  If I remember right its just a couple changes for bigger capacitors or something to make it more robust and good enough and hoping these people do it
How are maytech holding up?

what vesc out there doesn't break and what are the fail rates?!!!  If we have a forum and cant even figure that out I'm pissed and feel a fool.  we could turn the forum into a conglomerate or whatever its called and group buy everything from the best and get people here who know what the best is to make sure we can get it.
I'm broke though
it's seems the whole electronics world is getting cheaper and we're getting more expensive...years now

I will pay $150 for a chaka vesc any day (which was the barebones cost, add in $8 for the caps and cap board), I know it won't fail and if it does, it'll be taken care of.

But $155 for very little warranty, on a product that so far, I've had 1/10 that I sold already fail, is too much. To be told the fail rates are super low in the US, and then find out the rate rate was around 40%, is not good. And I only know because a customer hail mary reached out to me, assuming he couldn't get any help. How many others didn't reach out because they figured it was just a waste of time? 1/10 is still too high for me.

I'm also assuming these cost around $70 assembled to enertion. I know 100% markup is normal, but at least offer a decent price if we're going to buy 100 of them at once. Best price I can get is $130 per focbox in bulk, should be more like $100.

As a result, we are forced to look elsewhere for other vescs, which is why hummie created this.

I haven't tried the focbox yet because I've been reading about all the failures. I'm still using the older HobbyKing version and haven't had one failure yet through my bumbling beginner stages.. I just got two to test from diy because I want the bluetooth.. I hear people blow those up too though.

Isn't the fail rate because of people running 12s on FOC?
I installed a set of Focboxes on a local friend's board running 10s bldc unsensored and it's been working just fine.

It's called FOCbox for a reason... If it can't run FOC, than why put it in the name?

So far, I can't say much about it. From my testing, I had no issues or failures personally. But I also haven't pushed them very much either.

This seems the best solution. Its supposed to be better or equal to Focbox in reliability and since stewii is providing all the BOM, schematics and stencil files anyone can start manufacturing on large scale.

Interesting reviews. I push focboxes with 12s in foc on all of my builds. The focbox actually is very durable and doesn’t fail (usually) without operator error.

While I mostly agree, it's really a matter of luck whether you get a bulletproof focbox or not...and getting 60 day warranty coverage is near impossible

Mine was voided because I was using ackmaniacs firmware 🙄

Yea like I said, I’m not sure about your case in particular. But In general, it makes sense that they can’t warranty modified focboxes. 

What happened to your focbox anyhow?

Solderballs? They've been fine. Now they've updated things even further. 3.3 and FOC stable. I think I've been selling them for about 7 months. 2 returns. Actually 3, but 2 of them were just sent out for repair. The other one worked fine, so I used it in a build.

You want to know what if different between the stock fw on the focbox and 4.12? 

I think just from a business stand point, even if they are the same (I’m not sure) you should use the fw that the company warranties. All products have stipulations to avoid voiding warranties. Regardless how ridiculous they may sound. Don’t rip the tag off of your mattress, the tag does nothing, it doesn’t affect the integrity of the mattress. But if you take it off then you void your warranty. 


Also disclaimer. My comments in this thread are not to be used in a warranty claim. I may be incorrect, refer to Enertions terms and conditions for concrete warranty information.

I completely get all that and mostly agree, it just seems iffy, since it does seem as arbitrary as mattress tags as an easy way to mitigate warranty claims legitimate or not. 

And yeah I'm not treating this in anyway as "official communication" 😉

Are you talking about the FOCBOX?

Yes, all files should be released since it's based on his open source project, that's how these things work. I wrote an iphone app based on another open source project. Thus, I released source code because first, it might be helpful to others and second, I'm legally required to.

I have yet to see any FOCBOX BOM or pcb files or firmware code. Can anyone confirm if he ever released them?

I haven't seen a PCB design file, a BOM, or a Gerber file of the FOCBOX, just the schematic PDF. 

Do the heatsink design files need to be released too? Not sure if that's considered a derivative of Vedder's work.

Okay so I found the term where it states that’s software and hardware modifications are not covered. Towards the middle 
http://www.enertionboards.com/Enertion-boards-Terms-Conditions.html

It also states that if the product is out of warranty it can be sent in and repaired for a reasonable price. 

So to answer your old question, Changing to vedders 3.xx fw would in fact void your warranty.

Without the upgrades, they are more vulnerable. Also, assembly has been hit or miss on them. Some have no issues, some do, the consistency is not there.
