First off, I am semi responsible for this abomination. I tried to reconfigure it about a year ago and added further to what I think is a solid example of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make packs that look like this‚Äù

-use fishpaper and positive terminal protectors
-don‚Äôt solder cells
-if you must solder AWG wire to nickel, don‚Äôt do it after the nickel is attached to the cells
