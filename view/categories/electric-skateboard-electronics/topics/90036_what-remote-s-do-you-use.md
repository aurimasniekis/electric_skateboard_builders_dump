Hi all,

Just wanted to make a thread about different remotes people use and adv/disadvantages.

This should be interesting for anyone building a DIY or thinking of changing remotes.

**1. Model / Price?**

**2. Advantages?**

**3. Disadvantages?**

**4. Picture?**

**5. Overall review**


Please fill in these points with details on your remote/s.

Thanks
```

Wondering about these remotes, I have seen them paired with the cheap esc on eBay. https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F153428341566

I think this one is only usable with a certain ESC and there is no reciever in the picture.\
The Hoyt puck is highly regarded and if you wait a bit there will be a more budget friendly version.\
At the moment I use the new Flipsky remote which is a slight upgrade from the Nano X.

E: it wasn't for flipsky like I thought, it's the wowgo/meepo/ownboard controller. Unfortunately this isn't diyable :(

In your other post you mentioned that you can not access your master vesc because of broken USB. Keep in mind that you have to calibrate your remote in the BLDC or VESCtool when you get a new one.

He might get lucky, my mini remote VESC paired to my steez remote and no PPM calibration had to be done. (Still checked anyways :P ) 

That being said you should probably do it regardless OP, having the freshest calibration could save you from a sticky situation

That's great man! Big ups to @rey8801!\
With the new Flipsky remote you don't have to calibrate your remote before each ride, the thumbwheel has a whee bit more turning resistance which makes the remote a bit more controllable, I have both remotes the Nano X and the Flipsky and as others have said I got used to it but like the Flipsky a little bit more.

Yes you and @rey8801 helped alot, and also all others in the great community!

Do you have a link for the Flipsky? it seems to have a screen which is beneficial.

No screen just a battery gauge.

I did a poll last year on which remotes people use. Seems like the mini remote is a popular vote.

Will give it a go mate, if anything it is much better than my current nano x.

The remote @Linny linked above is highly regarded, it all depends on your preferences. The Benchwheel and the Maytech remote are recommended as well, give it a bit more thought.
