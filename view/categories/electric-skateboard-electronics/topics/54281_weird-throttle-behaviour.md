So board has been going well for a few days now but today a strange thing happened.  Full throttle on the remote (nano-x) and the power to the wheels sort of chopps in and out.

I connected the VESC tool via usb and turned the real time data on.  What I can see is the throttle on the esc tool (grey bar) behaving as I would expect but the ‚Äúfrom ESC‚Äù bar (green/red) is behaving as im experiancing with the motors chopping in and out etc.

Dual Foc box connected via can
Nano - x
Metr bluetooth on slave

Does anyone have any ideas?

Well I found my spare Nano X and it works.  Looks like that Nano is fooked - a total of 10 miles on the board and remote - opened the nano case up and the battery is about to blow.

Probably low battery voltage

They just ship a new one.  You probably won't have to return that one.  (My experience)
