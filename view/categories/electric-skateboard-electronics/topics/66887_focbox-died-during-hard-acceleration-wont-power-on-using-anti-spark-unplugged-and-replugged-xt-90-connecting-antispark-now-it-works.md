Hey guys, curious if anyone has run into this issue I had just now. I was riding my board, I went full throttle then it died. Turning it on and off using the power switch didn't do anything. When I opened it up, I tried turning it on and off again using my anti spark switch. I heard a high pitched whirring/whine sound and I see that the focboxes are just blinking blue. I unplugged and re-plugged my xt-90 and suddenly the board works properly again.

Super weird.

reboot helps, thatÂ´s good!
What your settings?
Maybe your bat max was too high and the focbox cut out?

I have a 60 amp bms and I set the batt max to 35a each vesc (dual setup). That's probably it but I'll have to do some more testing. Weird that it wouldn't power on unless I replug the xt-90s though.

I had similar issues, turned out the xt90s didn't make full contact any more. Spreaded the xt90 contacts a bit and everything was fine ever since :)

Hey guys, it happened again, but this time it was during fairly weak acceleration. I think my BMS is broken. Here's a video of what it looks like (you'll have to crank the volume up to hear the high pitched noise):
