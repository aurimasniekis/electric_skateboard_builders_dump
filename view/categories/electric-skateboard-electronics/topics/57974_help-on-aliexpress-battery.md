Hello Everyone

I'm trying to decide if I can use this battery from aliexpress
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Colaier-36V-10AH-bike-electric-car-battery-scooter-high-capacity-lithium-battery-does-not-include-the/32822790723.html?scm=1007.13339.90158.0&scm_id=1007.13339.90158.0&scm-url=1007.13339.90158.0&pvid=ff29bbf6-7a27-4dc7-a7bc-5b6fabd85710&_t=pvid:ff29bbf6-7a27-4dc7-a7bc-5b6fabd85710,scm-url:1007.13339.90158.0

it is rated for a 13amp continues and 40amp burst but I think it's the BMS inside that is the bottleneck, I'm thinking of bypassing the BMS and let the VESC too handle the overdischarge etc.

any help is really appreciated

I would not buy that, no indication what brand cells they have means its probably some cheap chinese li-ion - a regretful purchase for anyone willing to take it. Even if they said they use something like LG or samsung, it would most likely be fake anyway, the battery is way too cheap.

It is not worth saving money on the battery. Its literally the most important thing in the build.

Do not try and save money on the battery. It's the most dangerous part on your build. Get a genuin battery from a legit source

I just talked with ownborad and they have free shipping on their battery

I think it's a good option for a budget build
