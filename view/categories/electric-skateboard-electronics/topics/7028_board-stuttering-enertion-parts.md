Hey guys, I was cruising around my neighborhood and everything was fine for like 10 minutes then out of nowhere when i accelerated the board will start braking/stuttering, it wouldnt accelerate. I spinned the motor with my hand and it rotates fine no problems. Breaking will work weird you will not hear the motor breaking like i used to. Any ideas? Using enertion standard vesc, 6372 r spec, space cell 3 and gt2b

yeah exactly what I experienced. Don't continue riding because it would just eventually damage your VESC. It should be an easy fix if you are good with soldering and such. Just a c clip removal and shrinkwrap the copper wires within. I have yet to have the time to do it myself but shouldn't be that hard. Good luck!

I don't think you'll need to solder, just take it apart and insulate with electrical tape or heatshrink. I'm in CA if you want me to take a crack at it.

you need to get more insulation onto the wires.

you could try yourself... otherwise you'll need to send it back or find someone to it for you.
