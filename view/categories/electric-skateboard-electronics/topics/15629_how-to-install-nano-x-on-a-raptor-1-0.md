What is the best way to remove the Winning controller module in an Enertion Raptor, Gen 1.0?

I'd like to replace it with the new Nano-X controller.

The Winning module is glued into the enclosure and the wires have been soldered and coated on the ends with mounds of black glue.  

In advance, thanks for the help!

It's hot glue. So just warm it up with wifes/girlfriends hair dryer. 

The glue will go soft and you can remove the hardware.
