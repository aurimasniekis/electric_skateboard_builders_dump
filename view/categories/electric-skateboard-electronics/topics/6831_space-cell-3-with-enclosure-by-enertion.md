Hello guys I just recieved my space cell 3 with enclosure by Enertion and I was curious if anyone has installed this before and if so can you post pictures? Trying to figure out the best way to put the screws included. Thanks!

Drill 1/4" holes in your board and hammer in the rivets with a rubber mallet. You can see my pics here

I'm not sure but I think they're the same size as truck screws.
