# How do you deal with Focboxes 3.5 Connectors

I saw that modifications to the Focboxes void the wrarranty , but most motor wires don’t have plugs for 3.5mm. How do you get around this without voiding the warranty on both the motors or the Focboxes ? 

Also in the even in which soldering is a must , should on solder on 3.5mm Plugs on the motor wire ?

you could always make converter cables for the phase leads

Noone can tell you what you should do. You already seem to know know what it is possible.

FocBox side
- change connectors (W/void)
- replace cables (W/void - possibly not noticeable)

Motor side
- change connectors

Neutral
- use adapters (make or buy)

Pick one :)

What is ridiculous is using 5.5mm connector 😉, 3,5mm are more than enough for any esk8 use.

If I remember well I had 3.5 on my 4.12 VESC and I changed them to 5.5 to be able to connect to SK3 6374. I did not think about the warranty to be honest (for what it's worth...)

Haha, but the only reason FocBox comes with 3.5 connectors is Raptor 2 and it's hubs. If it was using 4mm, FocBox would have 4mm and so on. It's was just easier for Raptor production.

Not related to your comment but just information for everyone.
3.5mm might be enough provided you have quality connectors. The cheap ones most often have pretty crappy surface quality (gold plated my ass) and high resistance which could be a problem with high current transfer. So get decent connectors if you're swapping them.

Focbox use Genuine Amass connector, which are the real deals in term of bullet connector.

Yes, but R-Spec are still one of the most powerful motor out there, and they only use 3.5mm 🤪

Make an adapter. Solder a 3.5mm to a 5.5mm bullet connector then shrink tube. Done

BTW warranty BS. Changing connector should not void a warranty. Two out of six of the connectors on my FocBoxes had cold joints and pulled right out when I was pulled off the phase wires.

Just got my FOCBox today, was disapointed to see XT60 and the tiny bullet connectors... And replacing them void the warranty, what the F*. They should provide them without connectors in that case, or provide the option for it.
I don't want to make adapters, that just adds stuff that's not really needed. But at the same time, I need to at least test the Focbox to see if it works properly and if not, send it back. Decisions decisions... #1stWorldProblems

But DHL delivery was slow, it took almost a month (and I paid for that shipping).

Just solder on whatever connection you need. If you have issues just solder the 3.5 bullets that come with FOCBoxes back on. The original soldering is usually shit anyways. This part of the warranty is bullshit and you can tell them to prove it. 2 out of 3 of my FOCBoxes bullets fell off the second I got them. Not sure if QC is better now because I'm still waiting on a Cyber Monday order to get here.

I understand Company's have Long "terms and conditions" that practically say we have no rights
 which is fine, if its Just to protect the company from Savages who want to get rich from lawsuit,
To me what matters is how much the company values the people and there own reputation. 
And I don't think that enertion would Try to avoid returning faulty products because of modified connectors.

No. He's no longer using the forum... Just make them yourself? 

I think the best way is to cut off the shrink on the vesc leads and solder the 5.5mm female bullet onto it and re-apply heat shrink

I did the exact same thing like 3 hours ago. 12 adapter for my upcoming DD pair!
I've seen people heat shrink the adaptors, would. It be OK to use the heat shrink once it's connected to the motor and esc? Because I am using heat shrink to keep it all together anyways...

Those, although not clean look like they will work fine. I'd personally check with a multimeter to make sure the resistance on all of them is as low as possible and consistent. If not, I'd re-do them.

But why shrink after the fact? I'd make sure they are all shrunk and as isolated as possible before installing them... You don't want any shorts.

There's a lack of comprehension here on your side dude. I'll break it down so maybe you can understand. You dug up a post from a year ago that I was referencing a date (Cyber Monday) for the prior year. That's actually two years ago. So no. I don't keep buying. 2 years ago I made those mistakes. Get it now?

Another thing is I wasn't complaining. I was reporting all the broken and poor quality shit I kept receiving from them. You sure have horrible internet skills dude.
