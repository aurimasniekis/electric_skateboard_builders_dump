We'll be giving test rides with a production model of the Mellow Drive in Paris this weekend. Come one, come all.

Just back from riding with the Mellow team. To be honest, the ride provided by their system is really awesome. It's really predictable and so smooth. I think this is gonna change the way we ride our skateboards. Congrats!
