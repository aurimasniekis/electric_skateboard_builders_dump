Keeping the frame rigid, but only attached to the deck by the standard truck bolts means that decks with flex can be easily used.

Did you guys noticed any scrapping happening on the front of the unit? The part that is close to the ground, I'm kinda worried about in a extreme situation it touching the floor and locking the board and sending the rider flying with a high flex deck

 No scraping at all on a rigid deck, but no, we don't recommend the kind of two footed jumping you see in the video when riding. We wanted to show the limits of what was possible.
