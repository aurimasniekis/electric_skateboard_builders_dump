It looks good because it's a CG mockup. Lack of venting for the hub motors is a serious concern.

I found these on alibaba a while ago. The company says this is their first shipment.

I was interested in testing because their claims were stretching the truth.

> “first production of only 500sets at the mid of June”
> Interesting.

> As an engineer, I have questions based on what I have read.

> Your batteries cannot meet your specifications at 67.2 Wh. Based on nominal voltage, 

> 67.2Wh * 1000 / 42V (12s) = 1,600 mAh
> 67.2Wh * 1000 / 35V (10s) = 1,920 mAh
> 67.2Wh * 1000 / 28V (8s) = 2,400 mAh
> 67.2Wh * 1000 / 21V (6s) =3,200 mAh

> The most practical battery type is like 6-8s. Since your price per spare battery is $65, they are probably LiPo Polymer pouches. Even if I ignore LiPo battery safety and life cycle performance, 2.4Ah is insufficient for your board design to achieve its specified mileage: “12-15km” or “20km”, especially either “35km/h” or “20% grade”.

> Consider the following:

> Boosted Board (USA), 12s1p (99Wh, 2.35Ah), 2000Watt Dual Motor, 8-10km @ 35km/h & 25% grades.
> Yuneec E-Go (USA), 7s3p (232Wh, 7.8Ah), modified 1000Watt single Motor (operating at 400Watts), 20-30km @ 20km/h & 10% grades.

> I could give more examples, but I do not need to.  Direct drive is less efficient than geared (modern fact, cannot be questioned). 

> I know 2x1100Watts is not efficient dual 0.53 horsepower model (2000-3000Watts) requires 1-15Amp each to reach 35km/h on flats and up to 25Amp discharge per motors for 120kg on a 20% when starting from 0km/h. Your motor’s ability to climb a hill is questionable and would likely overheat the motors causing serious winding damage and battery strain (fire hazard). 

> Your maximum speed is also questionable because a motor wound 240Kv and geared at 13:36 can achieve a maximum of 30Km/h @ 10s (35V).  Dual hub motors can achieve 30-40Km/h @ 10s (35V) but are wound at 170Kv.  Your 8s (28V) motor could not reach 35km/h unless the motor Kv was very high, at which point you lose the ability to climb hills due to torque reduction.

> Your board, which obeys the laws of physics, cannot achieve the specified minimum average milage of 12km unless on a downhill trip (especially true given the complete kit weight of 3.5kg) nor can it achieve both 35Km/h top seed and 20% hill climbing power as a hub motor with your battery configuration.


> Your advertising information is either incorrect/false - could you please provide more information about your build to refute the above concerns?

I haven't heard from the manufacturer since. Given that they also sell other products with boosted board and yuneec board photos mixed in with the actual products picture, I think its safe to say it won't meet expectations. Its design concept is solid though.

Np - I'm glad someone posted about the products actual owner (the crowd fund) and not the alibaba manufacture link.

Alibaba was selling them for $319 for a single unit, so you might consider them first for pricing.

When VESC 5.0 hits, I would probably build something similar to this with 26650 cells. It might look too much like boosted for my liking, but it would leave at least leave proper thane lanes on asphalt.

Reselling these

http://www.gzwow.com/index.php?s=/Product/show/id/21.html

Quoted price I got from them is $295.50. 

Not sure what sample prices would be, but definitely not over 600euros.

The preformance numbers reflect the cost .... A pretty subdued ride if you ask me .... Def won't get the blood pumping...I'm gonna assume these are best case scenario numbers...if not inflated by a lot

Hey guys!!

Nice to see you are waiting on the Kickstarter, we are hoping to have it live on Tuesday so stay tuned for the early birds!!

We've developed everything in-house: hub motors that mount to any truck, all battery design and BMS and a our own VESC variant (we have had help from Vedder and will be providing him a donation per kit sold). Its completely modular so upgrades, swapping batteries, etc is really easy.

If you decide to pledge, let us know you are from the forum and provide your username. Well make your package extra special with a few extra goodies for the tinkerers!

Regards from Barcelona,
Team Unlimited

Have you ever started something in your workshop, and your wife calls, and you say just one more minute, and three hours later you're still in there, tinkering away, because the project is just too damn fun and just pulls you in and keeps you? 

Well, the last several months have been a bit like that.

Thanks for having us though. And be careful with those clones. 

It's not a question of competition - the early failures we've been hearing about is its own advertising for us anyway. (Nothing like wasting tons of money to make you look for better, more durable options.) It's the fact that, as you all know, any failure at the speeds and in the places we're riding will eventually be fatal. 

Just an example: each motor of the Onan X-1 is attached by three simple 5 mm screws. So six flimsy bits of metal are holding your whole body weight, absorbing each shock, each crack, each jump, etc. The unit we checked out already had deformed screws after a few short uses. That kind of design flaw is just the beginning.

Stay Mellow!

Hi Hummie, We have exploded views of the prototype motor on the Kickstarter main campaign page, and released a photo of the final version of our stator here in an update: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1800147378/mellow-the-electric-drive-that-fits-under-every-sk/posts/1551988

Yes, polyurethane. Let me get back to you on the other questions.

the stator looks more like a mockup in plastic or something.  it doesnt look like steel which it must be
I dont see an exploded view but just the outside and how the tire attaches. Maybe I missed it but could you link me to an exploded view please?
is it possible for the user to open the motor?


how long and wide is the stator?
the more info you give us the more we can figure if the power will be enough for us or if the motor will possibly deteriorate.  Dont things sold in germany have to last two years or something...some guarantee

It has to be steel. It's the best/only thing for a stator. That pic has to be a dummy or whatever u want to call it.  Wonder what's really inside the whole motor. Wonder when it will ever be for sale so we can see.  So many secrets in comercial enterprises.  Beautiful 3D facades.

A prototype would be an early test of something but a transparent stator is non-functional.  A stator has to have iron or some other ferromagnetic material.

## \#42 Posted by: Mellow Posted at: 2016-09-26T18:02:08.087Z Reads: 187

Yes, that's a mockup. Stator armature has to be ferromagnetic, as @Hummie said. Rotor can should be too, to increase the permeability (magnetic conductivity) and enhance the electric field within the motor. A certain Mellow clone (which will remain unnamed - hint, there's only two...at the moment) uses aluminum, racking up waste heat and losing efficiency. 

Back to Hummie's questions: We don't want to release the max amps figure now so that no one calculates system power erroneously, not including system efficiency. We've got 29V in the system now, but could go up to 110V with no big changes.
```

110 volts?  wow weird.  thanks for getting back.  I saw the video showing how quiet the esc is.  very nice.  can you tell us more about it?  but more so I really would like to know.....

what steel are you using for the shafts and bearing housings and is the motor open-able without a press?

It sounds like you want to do to our Mellow the same thing we do to every other e-skate we get out hands on! First to the dyno, then we disassemble...for science! :slight_smile: 

Concerning the materials, we don't want to release too much right now, but just trust that we did both extensive modeling and real-world stress testing:

How about a never-before-released photo of our production stator instead to keep you interested?

China. Don't expect a cheaper copy of the Mellow though...100% of dev, manufacturing and sourcing of the Mellow Drive was done in Europe, for piracy, control and quality reasons. 

The Onan line is your typical Chinese board stuffed into a plastic box on a truck.
