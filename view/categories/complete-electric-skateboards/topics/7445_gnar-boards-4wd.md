The gnarbboard weighs 86 pounds! So think it qualifies as a beast! They went just-about out of business... nothing is for sale any longer. I appreciate the innovation, but clearly newer (and better) technology is available now.

mine gets better range, has the same stat battery except mine is LION, mine is faster, not sure about acceleration
