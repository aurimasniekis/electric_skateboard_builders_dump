Over the last 12 months or so I have added lots of videos into my [Electric Skateboard Builder YouTube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/c/Enertion )  Some of them have lots of useful information about building electric skateboards, some of the videos are more generic product updates etc.

To help people find the [best electric skateboard building tutorials](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-building-video-tutorials-youtube-playlist/) I have created a link to them from my website.

Great. Easy to find. Now you have to make another video. How to upgrade from a 9mm to a 12mm belt drive on a dual Raptor.. making popcorn as we speak. :grin:

I actually wanted to create a very similar topic to this one.. so here will go the text I had already 'dedicated for that topic:

After watching @lowGuido esk8 making video I stumbled upon a bunch of other videos others have made about this topic.


Text and Picture info is all great n that but there are just a few things were video beats the pictures and text, I think..

One of the examples I found are these guys:

Lowguido's video should probably be here too, so @lowGuido feel free to post it here, if this topic gains some momentum and support from the members.  

Heck, if it would be a good compilation, maybe it should get pinned too.

I hope @onloop does not mind and im pretty sure lots of guys actually use enertion parts, like motor mount, motors, wheels etc anyways.

@lowGuido  yeh, I think this video thing is a very good idea. I saw lots of people commenting under your video actually. 

Some of them asking for parts list, of course.. but yeh :D

Plus, I think there are lots of people who actually even build out of youtube videos only, without visiting a forum and having some more in-depth Q&A
