I posted this video https://youtu.be/S9EtWgGte0s to YouTube showing my wife and I ride my new DIY board around in a parking lot and the only thing it's gotten so far is two thumbs down and comments saying boosted boards are better ðŸ˜‚ The best part about it is that I never claimed in the title or the description that it's better than any other board out there! Haha just thought people here may get a laugh at these fools :)

yeah, fully agree @goldenHusky - ignore them. You are having a blast with your wife riding your own deck. Don't get upset by such trolls. You'll always find people in life that will try to bring you down. Don't listen to them, move forward and smile.

Those comments are hilarious!!!! 

I agree though. Boosted boards are better than yours. Your board doesn't even have a name. If you have a Boosted board, you can use a sharpie and black out the "sted" so your board just says "BOO". Try that with your board whatever you call it. Real skaters know what's up and obviously you don't.

I've done many eskate-YT-vids and you get dislikes and stupid comments no matter what, thats' how YT works, just ignore them. Your video or your build is not rated by likes/dislikes of random people.

The latest comment I got was "What can this price of crap fly yeah lmfao"
I don't even understand what he was trying to say...
Maybe we should start a thread collecting stupid YT-comments like this.

I jumped back on the forum and looked at the youtube video after my class and couldn't believe all the DIY eboard support! hahaha you guys are so awesome! I just wanted to share the video to let you guys read the comments and get some laughs, little did I know just an hour later I'd have several dozen more views and over 20 likes on it! hahaha One thing DIY builders have on the boosted board is this incredible community! Your guys are all so awesome!

Damn! Those BB fanboys are really ignorants! I'd choose a DIY board made by myself everytime over a BB

Good work on the DIY!  casey neistat has created an army of trolls with the popularization of "boosted boards" I was just in Australia on my xmas vacation and an riding my DIY board around. It looks quite agricultural, nothing like a boosted and had several people say as I rode past. "boosted board Ayyhh?" :sunglasses: or nice boosted board. Mostly kids under 15. Youtube fame for you.

"...Why is Boosted Board the top selling and most popular board on the market if your precious DIY board is sooo good"
