Not sure which ones I'm gonna use for riding the long board. 

G-form sells flexible guards. They are very comfortable.

Using version 23.43 and the board specs are below:

MBS Comp 95
10s4p (built myself) - Samsung 30q - bestech BMS
dual turnigy 6374 149kv 
gears are 72/18
hubs/tires are 200x50

if you watch that video closely it looks like I get wobbly a few seconds before the crash, I thought that was me slowing down but I am not starting to think it was a split second cut-off (although I cannot be sure)

happy to help test further, would love to get this thing to work without it wanting to throw me off randomly.

thanks bud! and I'm hopeful they'll find a fix, or I will keep screwing around with it until I do... I'm too stubborn to give up on anything, and this is my first build... have all the pieces sitting here for my next, just waiting on my trampa board to get here so I am hoping it can be fixed sooner rather than later.

I swear there was a huge thread about this (that I've read through) but I cannot find it?

stoked video, nonetheless and thanks for sharing.  glad you're okay.  

At that speed, I think you'd have visible wear marks on the path and your 6x2 tires if this were a case of instant braking.

This appears, to me, that you were leaning into the momentum and suffered a momentary cut-out.

When the power popped back on, the board appears to restore acceleration, causing you to lose balance.  Would have happened to any of us and nice recovery.

@AlanZhou why are you stating that this caused instant brakes?  Did I miss something?

@ShueBox

Looks like you are on old firmware mate!
New Version is 23.44
Please follow this guide to re-flash the firmware, I think that will fix the issue. **(USB Transmission Method recommended)**
 https://enertionboards.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000944555-How-to-Update-the-Unity-for-a-Raptor-2-1-or-DIY-Board-VIA-Android-OR-Windows-PC

Also, looks like your remote is off calibrated a little, re-calibrate it as precise as possible.

About your accident: That's really unfortunate and I deeply apologize for it.
I hope you will get well soon mate :slight_smile:
Looking forward to see you fine & healthy :slight_smile:

Yeah I have it all apart, adding new motor mounts and have some sealed 192kv sensored motors I’ll be putting back on in about 16 hours when they’re done printing.

And no apologies needed, I knew the issue and I knew the risk, not your fault at all. I appreciate your help getting this fixed though, maybe I needed that to teach me to wear my gear all the time lol 

And just to confirm, this is a permanent fix for this? Was this something in the code? Just curious as to what the issue actually was so I know it wasn’t something stupid I was doing!

I would quadruple check your ppm connection and make sure that your remote receiver has a proper "fail safe".  shake it around a bit to see if the light on the receiver flickers

to test fail safe: on the bench, run your motors and turn off your remote. If your motors coast to a stop, you're ok. If they continue running, no bueno, if they brake, no bueno. This is a behavior from the receiver.
```

## \#41 Posted by: CarlCollins Posted at: 2019-05-27T18:52:06.608Z Reads: 177

As @Blasto mentioned, it's more likely an issue with the remote calibration.

How about checking 
1: Receiver's Servo cable 
2: PPM values
3: Battery of the remote (condition)
4: Interference in the environment 

Also, check which Blasto indicated.
```

---
## \#42 Posted by: Blasto Posted at: 2019-05-27T19:00:27.169Z Reads: 173

```
receiver fail-safe is different from remote calibration (in app calibration)

fail safe is the default ppm timing that the receiver sends out in the case of a Lost Of Signal (lost communication from hand device to receiver) 

In app calibration is only the extremes of the ppm signal.

@ShueBox follow up question, what remote are you using?

It did do that my first test run, very slow speeds, receiver cable came loose and it stopped. Have since upgraded the connectors but haven't tested to see how that works on the unity but thats #1 when I get it back together.

And although it sounds like that I cut about 45 seconds out of that video - the board was completely off but the problem is the power switch on the battery got turned off when it flipped so I have no way to know if it was off before it flipped or not but I am going to look into the possibility of the remote doing that. Its just a simple maytech, and being my first build I will do some research on the board and see what I can find.

Thanks for pointing that out though, I never thought to check to see what the failsafe is for that... although I think it would be built into the ESC's firmware and not so much the remote (given its simply a receiver)??

Worst part, or the most annoying, is the blister on my hand from the gloves getting so hot from the pavement.. went ahead and ordered some MBS gloves with the plastic wrist guard, never thought those would be comfy but I’d rather slide on those than my hands again!

Oh yes, F4 bindings otherwise I would have been flying in front of the gopro lol.. and I was able to ride it home, albeit at lower speeds, just broke the bottom part of my left motor mount (which was 3d printed, no biggy) but it worked perfectly fine on the way home after the crash.

No, it was off because the board flipped and the ground hit the on/off rocker switch and turned the battery off... flipped it back on, turned on the focbox and off we went. 

I can’t confirm it didn’t turn off before that since the switch had been flipped but everything worked perfectly fine as soon as I turned it back on

Connections are solid. Welded tops, soldered everything else. Been doing that for 15+ years so that’s definitely not the issue.. think it’s the maytech remote, been playing around with the wires and it’s just going from 0% to -100% just by moving them around.. must be a short or something, time to solder those together too

Just a little warning. That voltage meter is very likely prone to water ingress. Don't expect that case to be rain proof. There are so called waterproof versions available too (these don't have the electronics exposed at the bottom), but the only difference is that the water gathers in the electronics bay/the voltage meter circuitry itself will still drown.

Only fix is coating the components and sealing it all with silicone for example, which still leaves you with water ingress around the display itself.

Yeah they are a PITA but I ended up sealing it inside and out with silicone.. not water proof but more than sufficient for what it'll be used for... if I drive in a lake I'm not so sure I would run after that battery anyway... just wait for hazmat.. seen too many of those things self destruct!

yes. The throttle drops, becomes unresponsive, and cuts out. No brakes, no gas, just free roll. It is not the face streeter that the winning was for sure, but neither was the Gen 1 steeze remote. This is why i'm still with Maytech on remotes. 

I've had it happen multiple times. This last time the receiver just died of old age or abuse, just flaked out and then nothing. Time before that, wires got smashed under a screw and shorted. Another time they just got disconnected with vibrations. 

It just puts you in a free roll, which can be a little bit of a shock if you're holding the throttle down at the time. Losing brakes sucks too.

I figure its an isolated issue, but I fixed a bunch of my cutouts by just soldering the ppm wires together(focbox ppm wires to the reciever wires). I found the connector they shipped with was kind of crappy at keeping the crimped wires in place :man_shrugging:

This was my old build, which has since been dismantled... cant do any further testing :L

Well after some absolutely horrific customer service from Enertion (actually, Mr Collins above) I got the board back together with this amazing new upgraded firmware... well on my VERY FIRST BENCH TEST doing the guided setup my unity burns out... GREAT WORK GUYS!

So now I have a "nano x" controller that is TWICE THE SIZE AS SHOWN ONLINE and made cheaply in China (which I had to fight with Carl Collins to even get in the first place after numerous promises it had shipped when in reality they never shipped it... and just stopped responding when they have no answer for you), one broken Unity that worked PERFECTLY FINE (minus the throw me off and try to kill me issue) before their amazing firmware upgrade and will probably just be told it's my fault and they won't replace it.... and I have another on order for a while now that they refuse to give me a refund on.


So how should I go about this? What options do I have @EnertionSupport and how long before I can at least get an answer from your horrific customer service department (or Carl Collins, seems he is your whole customer service department???)???

Carl, YOU'RE THE ONE IGNORING MY EMAILS UNTIL I THREATEN TO CONTACT MY CC COMPANY. Don’t act stupid, YOU'RE THE PERSON PROVIDING THE HORRIBLE SERVICE. Do you REALLY want me to paste the email chains on here? If you honestly don’t know, I’ll gladly copy and paste each email, I would prefer to avoid further embarrassment of you but will gladly post them if you continue to act like you’re clueless. Nathan Shue - look it up.

@ShueBox I AM NOT IGNORING YOUR EMAILS.
As everyone knows that support is now 12 hours Monday to Friday and also please don't expect a quick answer on emails.

About your inquiry, You asked me to ship the Unity without the new firmware update and I told you that you are okay with the older version of firmware, just ship a unit for you.

Then I replied yesterday

**Hey Nathan** 

**Apologies for the delay in response!**
**About the Instagram post, they are ready but not delivered to the logisitcs from the production unit.**
**So they will be coming in next week and then we will start shipping them.**

**So, it will be best for you to wait until the end of this month to get the updated version.**

**What do you think?**

After that you replied today
**That is fine, I’ll expect it by months end and if nothing comes I’ll work with the bank on a refund.**

And also: **Welp, the new firmware just burnt out my current Unity... how do I go about getting that replaced or repaired without having to wait a year?** 

Please keep in mind that Support is only available for 12 hours (7 am to 7 pm US time) which means my shift started only an hour ago.
And I do reply to your email within 24 hours.

Also received a response 14 minutes ago.

We announced this in our most recent newsletter if you missed it.

All you need to do is have some patience man.


PS: Always expect a reply within 24 hours from the support (not instant)

Also, not sure how it's the horrible customer service :thinking:

No need, as soon as I have two hours to waste I will post them. Starting with the nano x remote, questions that still haven’t been answered, lies about it being shipped, multiple emails over NUMEROUS DAYS without response until I threaten to file a claim with my bank. I’ll show the real side, not your edited BS. Also, would love to just get a refund on my other Unity, I am done with your company and if I can’t trust it to work on the bench then I sure as hell don’t trust it with me on it. Or do you still have a “rule” about returns? Didn’t see that in the fine writing but would be happy to get my attorney involved if need be.

First of all, I haven't edited any of the response, I simply copy-pasted them.
2ndly, I think we already shipped your NANO-X and I have already provided you the tracking ID on which you asked following thing?

**Do you have a manager? Is there anyone above you that can actually help me? Your customer service is absolutely horrendous and before I take this public I want to make sure this isn’t just you - I’d hate to ruin the reputation of a company based on one person but this is absolutely ridiculous.**

Tracking ID of the NANO-X shipment: http://www.dhl.com.au/en/express/tracking.html?AWB=8347711772&brand=DHL

Not sure what else do you want the reply for on that thread as the product is shipped and delivered as well


We only have 3 open tickets from you
1: 80042
2: 80664
3: 80443

One of which Rizwan has replied to you.

Other than that if there is any, let me know.

Also, I have replied to you for the broken one because needed some information before escalating it to the technical team.

PS: I have merged all of your cases to single thread now.

Not sure what's with you mate, you agreed with the shipment of the product by end of this month and now you are asking for a refund?

Because CUSTOMER ASKED AND CONFIRMED THAT HE WILL WAIT FOR THE SHIPMENT TILL END OF THIS MONTH. That's why he has to re-confirm that he changes his mind again so we will let him know the policies of the refunding an order.

Its not "built to order" its just on "backorder" so if you can't ship it because its not ready how am I going to be dinged for that? At your discretion, you don't think you can waive the 20% fee in this instance? If that's the case then I'll wait for it, sell it, and add this to the list of problems with your company. 

You should start looking out for your customers if you plan to be successful. Friendly tip.

I already waived fee on the NANO-X return, not able to do that for Unity.

You left off the first sentence, likely on purpose since it HASN’T BEEN DISPATCHED:

Haven't left off on purpose, I have already notified you on which you've agreed to wait till the end of this month no?

[quote="ShueBox, post:115, topic:95096"]
You should start looking out for your customers if you plan to be successful.

We are looking out for them and in the end, we want you to be our customers but you've already made your mind.

No Carl, I am NOT AGREEING TO WAIT, I WANT A REFUND. I dont understand how many different ways I need to say that, I WANT A REFUND I AM NOT WAITING FOR ANOTHER FAULTY PRODUCT FROM YOU. 

REFUND, REFUND, REFUND. Why is this so hard to understand? Am I not communicating this properly? I want a refund, plain and simple. Nothing is dispatched, nothing is ready to ship, PLEASE REFUND MY MONEY.

Of course you do, so you can continue to blow me off and give me your BS excuses. Like I said, I am done with you and your company, please refund my money in full as per your "discretion" or tell me what in your "terms and agreements" proves otherwise. This is absolutely ridiculous.

Already told you the terms but you are still arguing, waiting for your response on the email.
You can stop wasting time here instead and reply to the email thread so I will let you know further about the procedure of refund.

Already provided what terms and conditions proves and not possible to provide 100% refund on the Unity order. 20% fee is still applicable.

Happy to refund 100% for the NANO-X once you return it to the nearest repair agent. 

Straight and Simple :)

I'll keep the controller for parts and will contact my bank regarding the Unity and resolve it that way. Thanks for nothing Carl, have a good day sir!

Nothing man, I don't want to start another long conversation here.
There is nothing personal with you, I will now contact you when I have the tracking ID for your order.
That's what you told me to do on the email conversation :slight_smile:

I don't blame yah, there is plenty of people out there that need to blow something up without checking themselves. This thread doesn't seem to be very productive on account of ShueBox not taking a step back and realizing "screaming and ranting" won't get things resolved. Sounds like he needs to outline exactly what he wants and expects going forward whether that be continuing with Enertion or getting rid of everything to do with them. (Bullet points might be good for emphasis since he likes drama!!)

It seems that he's gotten most of what he wants you to agree to but from what I see on this side its all a mess so I wouldn't blame you for wanting him to outline exactly what he wants/expects from this point forward but in a calm manner... It would also benefit him if the bank gets involved and you "continue to be ridiculous" :wink:

@bsancken  From the beginning, I don't want this to be on this forum that's why I tried to response on the email he sent us.
There is still another story which I don't want to share in public.

In the end, I am still willing to help him even though he don't want it now :slight_smile:

From the beginning I only asked for what I paid for, you never responded and came up with BS excuses. You and your boyfriend up there should get a room, but only after I get my refund or my product so I can resell the POS to someone else.

@ShueBox Nathan come on... I agree the 20% fee is nonesense, I even called it illegal. Fact is you agreed to it by ordering.

And the nano-x IS one of the smallest remotes available. Just below the shown drawing is video. Does it look that much bigger in a real hand than on the drawing? I have big hands... you have small hands... so now the nano-x is falsely advertised?

![Screenshot_20190621-215431_YouTube|689x500](upload://oHl11Wmm6ITMtc03jCEHk4gK6TE.jpeg) 

If nothing goes the forum is fine to complain once. But you should use PMs for the rest if emails don't work.

lol Marc I agree, and my outlash at the remote was uncalled for.. it’s decent, at best, but coming from China it looks and feels cheap and is much bigger than I expected. I probably over exaggerated because of my horrible experience with their “customer service” which I stand behind the fact is absolutely horrific. 

But at the end of the day, this is all because I could not get ANY resolution via email, and when they quit responding (and Carl’s bullshit claims that he only works so many hours but I go days without response) it’s extremely frustrating..  then to top it off, after I damn near killed myself because of their faulty firmware, I upgrade to the new version and the very first time I try it my $350 ESC is fried... and it burns out on an accessory output that is not being used, I’m obviously frustrated. Mr Collins bullshit just pushed me off the edge, and I will never again promote, refer or buy from this company. And I will make it a mission to ensure nobody else has to either. I’ve been in customer service, I’ve owned numerous businesses and I’ve worked for some of the top companies in the world... I tried my best to resolve this via email but when I get no response and continue to be blown off then it goes beyond money... at this point it’s about principle and bottom line is their customer service, their process and procedures are bullshit. Plain and simple, and if they want to stand behind their illogical procedures that’s fine, like I told Carl via email before... when I get their new Unity I’m sending it to China to have it reverse engineered and will be selling them to EVERYONE at cost.. because China has no trademark laws and I’m a man of principle. You live and you learn, lesson learned for me.. theirs is soon to come.

Enertion owes me 1800usd... I am in a worse spot than you I think but I can say carl never bullshited me and adrian (coo of enertion) took the time to explain it to me long and thorough.

Its a shitty situation but believe me the enertion guys don't think its funny. They do their best - yes its not enough but they know it.
