MAN I would love to cruise on those glass smooth roads. :star_struck: Like how you can just get away with skating directly in the car lanes like Casey Neistat. :sunglasses:

All streets are not all like that, they are usually really bad roads, however if you know the city you can stick to ride only over good streets and ride vitually anywhere.

My city is that way, too...  Once you figure out where to skate, it's nice.  Also some roads are crap but have certain places you can roll down that not crap... once you figure all that out, that is.

When I built my Trampa on pneumatics, it was like if the City had renew all pavements, like I could go anywhere without the need to plan the ride, choose which street to take or slow down on bad roads. I miss my Phoenix.

I have to be honest, I‚Äôm grimacing every time you cut off a pedestrian in the crosswalks. For future esk8 relations, you might consider giving pedestrians the ‚Äúright of way‚Äù.

You sold the Phoenix? What do you think about an enclosure for the raptor 2 on the evo (battery meter and switch window)? 

Damn, all my enclosures are going to be coming from you! üòç
