Sorry guys, since those boards aren’t DIY, I’m linking you to the thread on the sister forum for completes. 

Hopefully you don’t mind and if you have completes you’ll join us there!

nice man! I love Lyon, amazing City with truly insane surroundings, it's one of the best Cities I lived so far! Really like the run from Uni to Meribel ;)

I think this is the first e-board commute video i’ve ever watched with good music in the background. I usually automatically mute them before watching. Also nice trip and great looking board!
