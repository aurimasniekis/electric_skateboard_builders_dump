You should check local laws but most likely you should be riding on the street.  Just a heads up I got stopped by the police for riding on a sidewalk and they've seen me cruising all around and never stopped me before.  Also pedestrians have the right of way in most places keep in mind we're the weirdos :slight_smile:
