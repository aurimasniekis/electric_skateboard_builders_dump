I think u need to learn an Olli first. Maybe without speed and then with some speed. After that apply it to this nice Quarter and you will jump higher, smoothier and more Controlled with less speed. This always seems a bit scary and uncontrollated. Though you got the hang of the weird technique

Ollie is a different skill set that jumping at speed with bindings on.

I would disagree. You would take off the ramp with an Olli like move! Same on Snowboard Big jumps.

You will always want to jump a bit higher and more Controlled. I speak by experience

It seems a lot more Controlled! Especially the landing. Nice job.

Can you share your opinion / experience?

My opinion, it‚Äòs not so easy to leave the Kicker with an Olli, but that is just Training. Because if i hit the Kicker, the wheels are pushing uphill (u feel it) and i don‚Äòt want to jump too early (backwheels till end of Kicker) i don‚Äòt know but it feels better with every Jump
