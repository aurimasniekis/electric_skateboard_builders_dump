Shouldn't be too hard for you to see what we are working on, just need to log out. Why do I need to serve everything on a silver platter? :grin:

I feel for you! I grew up around mountains and when I spent a year near Cleveland I nearly lost my mind not having any "vistas".

Don't forget the 4000 lbs vehicle 10 ft behind me! You should do a deadpool and see how many of these videos I can make before I become a speed bump! I have walked away from falls but not so sure I can take being run over.
