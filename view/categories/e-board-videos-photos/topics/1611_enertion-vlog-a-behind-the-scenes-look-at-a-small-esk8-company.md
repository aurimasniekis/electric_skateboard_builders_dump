I am always getting emails from people asking about the latest updates at enertion, what am I working on in my lair? etc.

So I decided the best way to keep everyone informed about what I am doing is just make a 10min video each day.

this is VLOG #1

Like the idea. 
Potential topics: *some you've done before, but seeing how quickly eboards are evolving an update might make sense.
- Upcoming products, i.e I've heard you mention potentially offering a more powerful space cell.
- customizing VESC settings 
- board shapes/enclosure ideas 
- raptor specific updates
- guidance on type of board (satellite vs hub, single vs dual) to build or buy for common needs/wants, i.e. similar to your motor diagram, but with examples and video (uphill on single vs dual, etc).

I was just planning to make one of those to carry in my backpack. 
This could be so handy when heading out to the beach and skate around all day.
I've made a thread about it just recently.
