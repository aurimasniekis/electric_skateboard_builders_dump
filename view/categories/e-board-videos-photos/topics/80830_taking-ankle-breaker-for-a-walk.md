Fresh out of the assembly line (a.k.a. my garage), this Mtn Board build is ready to ride.  Some footage of Riding around Jax Beach.

If ya don't like pavement (which I'm surrounded by), than start the video at 3:40 ;)

Mostly dancing...  Occasional wobble here and there.  Still getting used to mountain trucks.
