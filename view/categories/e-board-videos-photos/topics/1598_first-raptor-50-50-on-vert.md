No just the trucks. It took some getting use to on tranny. But it was was fun as hell. No pumping at all. Next is frontside air. And maybe a hand plant

this kind of hurts me a little inside because i know what those motors are going to look like after doing this a couple of times. I'm finishing up a repair on a raptor right now that looks like somebody did a curb grind on it. Those poor motors...

Sorry about the scratches in the trucks. Notice anything different about the trucks other than the grind scratches?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e81cb8f53d84101bc6f4de526bbd339cb8edad5c.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6f9bbb8cc8294c8ab2b7b44a7882e02b9bd6a8e4.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1d0cf289560b7604750174ba74f1fd7b21d007d3.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/faec106c8fdd1bf13876995de3a13473ccb14eda.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

yeah they're proper Caliber IIs and not Enertion branded Caliber IIs, which, interestingly enough, have a silk finish that better matches the anodize finish on the mounts.

I love my Raptor but this is the reason I put my caliber ll's on and took pictures. So somebody else would notice the sparkly trucks. ;) actually wish they were a little darker

I remember you said you were seeing your brother in the us. I think Seattle. Anyway would you be interested in filming a 53 yr old raptor lover doing soon 50/50's on vert. I'm about 3 hrs from there and would love to come over that way and be your oldest rad dude rocking your raptors. Just saying.
