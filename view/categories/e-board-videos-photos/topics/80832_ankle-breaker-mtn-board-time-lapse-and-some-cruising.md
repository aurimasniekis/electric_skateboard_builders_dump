Awesome build!
What deck is that? Did you make it from scratch? I saw that you said it was a mod?
Also, did you make those motor covers? Or if you bought them, do you know where so I could grab some?

Cheers man.

Owen,  here is a link to this deck

https://www.ebay.com/itm/DIPPED-BLACK-FREERIDE-FREESTYLE-LONGBOARD-DROP-Down-CONCAVE-10-x-40-Cruiser/372344602055?hash=item56b177bdc7:g:jQgAAOSwiwZcKwuy:sc:FedExHomeDelivery!32250!US!-1:rk:10:pf:0

It is 40'' by 10'' and not designed for mtn board.  Because I had to make my own oversized big wedges (which created a bigger lever, which in turn applied extra torque on the deck during turns) for the mtn trucks, I fiberglassed top and bottom of the deck to make it more sturdy.

Motor covers came with the motors and trucks in a kit.  I have removed them because dirt and small rocks would just get trapped between the motor and motor cover.  Here us the link to the truck kit.  I recommend using different motors though ( the ones that are on the kit are 200 kv. 170kv is more appropriate in my case)

Hi Art,

Thanks for providing all the links and answering my questions!

I really liked the shape of the deck so that's why I asked, my build isn't going to be a MTB so that shouldn't be a problem with the riser pads and torque on the board.

I only ask about the motor covers because I don't want pebbles to get into my motors during day to day use as i'm using 260KV SK8 motors dual drive and they have big holes in for air circulation.

But I love your build and can't wait to see more,.

I don't know much about spot welding but that looks like a really nice way to do it, the automatic motion of the welding prong thingies sure is cool :)

Imma butt into this :slight_smile: 

Spot welding 18650 cells is so fast and not hot compared to soldering (so you don't damage the cells) but the machines are so expensiiiiive....

I haven't built a single pack, but I've found someone whos quality I'm very happy with considering my last two packs before that werent quite to my standards

I know it's the spirit of diy to tell others to forge on and try it themselves but I have no interest learning it or having the chance to blow myself up (hyperbole, calm down....)

I know the cost benefit too, but I enjoy supporting others

First pack I build I tried soldering.  Do not SOLDER.  I destroyed about 30 18650s.

At least you learned from it and and progressed using a different method, good on you

I got mine for $80ish on amazon.  It's sunko.  Used it a bunch.  Works well.

This is not the same one as mine, but the most frugal option I could find.  Ebay n Alli may have a better deal.
