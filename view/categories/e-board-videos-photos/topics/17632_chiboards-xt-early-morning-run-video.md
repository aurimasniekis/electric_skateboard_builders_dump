Whats up guys. 

My friend wanted to make a short video on my boards and i didnt have the heart to say no.  He's trying to start his youtube channel so take a look at this video.  Its pretty much just some early morning lowish speed riding on a couple mountain boards. 

and if you like me in anyway, subscribe to his channel.
