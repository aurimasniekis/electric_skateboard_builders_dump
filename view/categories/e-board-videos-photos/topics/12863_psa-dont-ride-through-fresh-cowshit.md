Thanks for bringing up the attention to this issue. I have been eager to ride through fresh cowshit until now.
Do you think fresh pig shit is worth trying? I really like the slippery characteristic of it, it makes the drifts smoooth as a butter.

I've ridden over plenty of stale cowshit before is all I'm saying. Just watch out for that fresh stuff.

Yeah, I think you should avoid all the fresh stuff if you can't avoid them.

I think we can agree that all types of fresh feces are undesirable to ride through. Let us try to stick to the stale excrement from this point on.

IMO the best way to clean everything is.... BURN it and start a new build :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
