eATB riding is going to start gearing up a notch now that TrampaBoards has the Brindy brothers on board!

Here's Matt throwing down possibly the 1st eATB 360?:

And his younger brother Andy shredding a pump track:

If you've not heard of these guys check out there Instagram's, Matt Brind also has a pro athlete Facebook page. Matt is a multiple world champion mountainboarder and also did a tour with Nitro Circus, his younger brother is hot on his heels in terms of skills. I can see some cool things to come from these guys...

Not hating on this guy's but Moja did a 360 on a E Trampa last year when promoting the Raptor 2 in NYC

Cool, had no idea if it'd been done or not, hence the "possibly" and the "?". To be honest I would have been surprised if it actually was the 1st.

Sorry about that! Mountainboarders have typically referred to them as ATBs to avoid this very issue! (All Terrain Board). But I've only ever seen them referred to as eMTBs on this forum. Not seen an eATB yet, doesn't quite look right either.

Have a read through this thread and you'll see that I've been baging the drum on this too!!!

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/semantics-emtb-is-it-a-board-or-a-bike/21887/27

Reading back through it now I'd say that most people agree eATB or e-ATB is the most apt naming convention for these boards.  It's kinda already agreed upon anyway as you suggested by the fact that mountainboarders have already been using ATB to get away from the MTB sport.  

From here on in I'll only refer to my board as eATB (or e-ATB?) and hopefully others will start to accept that term too :slight_smile:

Ha! Hadn't seen that thread...
I'll be using eATB from now on too then. Just changed all references in the thread.
Let the revolution begin!

SHIT YEAH!  SOoooo...do we go with e-ATB or eATB?  I was leaning more towards e-ATB until I just saw you write eATB :joy:

So I just went with e-ATB for all my related Youtube videos and it's way easier to find my content!!
