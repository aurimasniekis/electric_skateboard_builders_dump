Awesome!
Just a friendly reminder, you don't wanna hit your head to the ground in 40km/h and get skinned to the bone in the face, so wear a helmet next time ;)

Well aware! Apart from this first ride I've always worn a helmet since. I'm finding speed wobbles at full speed terrifying as it is ;)

You should not be getting speed wobbles at those speeds. 
Are you running your trucks super loose? Might just need to tighten them.
Are you running spacers between your wheel bearings with wheel locked down tight? 
if you still get wobbles after that, then you might need to upgrade your truck bushings and pivot cups.

Speed wobbles are at around 26/27mph. Trucks are as tight as I'd like them as I already seem to have quite a reduced turning radius. You may be onto something with the bushings though, one melted slightly during the welding of the motor mount! I'll try and find a replacement and see if it improves things. Thanks for the suggestion!

Sounds like you definitely need new bushings and don't forget pivot cups.  They also make a difference. 
Riptide makes quality Pivot cups for various brands of trucks.
Riptide Krank double barrel bushings are very high rebound and are responsive and stable.
