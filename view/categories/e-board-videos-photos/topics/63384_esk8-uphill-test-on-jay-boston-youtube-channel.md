guys I just found these esk8 uphill testing videos on a youtube channel Jay boston (just discovered today) and thought I should share them here. 

it's not really about building esk8 but these two video did gave esk8 newbies (like me :-) )some interesting insight about those commercial boards out there.

Bajaboards are just beasts, not really boards at all.  The G4X went up a hill you couldn't even walk up.

Please don't categorize Trampa as Trampa, in general, it's so wrong... My Trampa for e.g. is 10kW board and that hill is like flat road :)

Did you use the stock settings on the raptor?

Canâ€™t help but think Iâ€™ve give Trampas a bad name everywhere ðŸ˜‚. That was my board. It is a valid point though, one that doesnâ€™t necessarily matter in the quest for more views ðŸ˜‰

Letâ€™s just say it wasnâ€™t the most scientific test. Imagine riding a board like a Trampa up that when youâ€™d never even seen one before. The raptor got 3 attempts, and it was the test riders board. Trampa only got one and based on what the test rider said on the way down didnâ€™t do it justice. Lots of wheel spin, pausing, then back on the throttle. Nasty conditions to be doing on urethane.

Since when an uphill contest without an Acton Qu4tro is a fair contest? C'mon Jay, you are cracking now? ..but then, thats Australia (with cockatoos and all). 'Cracking' Evolves, Raptors, etc..... why don't you crack a Wombat for a change? :roll_eyes:
