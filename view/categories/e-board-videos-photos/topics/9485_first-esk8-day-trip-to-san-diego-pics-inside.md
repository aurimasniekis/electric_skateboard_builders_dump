thanks! Have you been before? Im giving San Diego a B versus LA's A+, it was nice to get around but kinda boring from the longboard.Would possibly be more fun just bar crawling without the electric board, since everything is sorta close. Apparently the girl the kissing statue was modeled after just recently passed away at age 96 or something.
