this isn't strictly esk8, but it does feature my 6S build pretty prominently abut two thirds of the way through. This is actually a music video for a song i wrote and recorded.

This is awesome man. What part of NYC are you from? I grew up in Queens (Far Rock, Astoria, Woodside) but recently moved to Ann Arbor in July. How's the ESK8 scene out there? Other than Casey Neistat riding the Boosted in Manhattan are there many others?

Hi 
I'm from the Bx. 

The eSk8 scene around my area not do active, I hope that will change in the near future. 

I know some guys have been getting boosted but not that I have encounter any eSk8r. I Think they just use them to commute not for joy riding. 

I like more the joy rides to unwind, don't like to mingle with the city traffic. 

I read your eSk8 piece on your site, nice work man, that is a great perspective on the satisfaction and impact of building something with you own hands to satisfaction.

Oh cool yeah I thought I recognized some of those spots in the BX. I took some classes at Manhattan College and my sister lives out in Riverdale so I'm familiar with that area and parts of Inwood. Yeah I figured the mountain board would be tough to maneuver around the city and it looks like a blast for unwinding. I have a lot of purist skater friends that I grew up with in NYC and they kinda shake their heads when they see me posting about ESK8. The skaters out here seem a little more willing to try it.

I think I ran across your build article either here on ES. Would you mind sending that to me, I'm kind of intrigued with potentially building a mountain board which would definitely work here in Michigan.

The self-built eboard revolution is here...  if i have my way in the future there will be more people building their own eboard than those who buy one in a box.

Got some more riding time in today with my buddy Pat and published [a small article here][1]. Still haven't found smooth asphalt on these sketchy Michigan roads but we'll discover it soon :smile: Really impressed with how this Carvon single hub is holding up in this rough terrain. Oh and it's a lot colder than it looks.

I plan to tackle some trails when the weather warms up. Do you roughly estimate your speed and distance to measure when you need to head back to your car or just wing it?
```

## \#48 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2016-02-08T15:32:04.376Z Reads: 741

```
Being uber familiar with the trails helps, but yes, that's exactly what i do: roughly estimate and wing it. I turn around at 52% battery if my guess of the halfway point hasn't arrived yet and attempt to maintain the same kind of riding style on the way back. So far that way of doing it has not failed me. 

The trail in that video is 4.87 miles long from my parking spot to the board-walk dead end where i turn around, which makes for a ~9.7 mile ride total. My 220Wh 6S (The Red Baroness, which is currently dead, needs battery) can make that ride provided i keep it below 15mph (which for me is run out speed, barely need pads or helmet or anything, so sometimes i don't wear any gear and just sip my soda the whole way and let me hair fly). Scarlet is running a re-packed space cell, so its a 10S 270Wh board and can make that trip while averaging almost 20mph, which means plenty of top-out stretches as long as i keep the cruise more casual at some points. It also means i'm wearing a helmet and I have pads under my hoodie and jeans. 

My next build is going to be a 12S 12Ah ~530Wh single drive 6372ish graphene lipo build and I'm going to utterly murder that trail from start to finish, possibly twice in a row. Sometime this year, i may have the extra cash for my personal ride to update it and do this. My propdrive 270s are still killing it, but i think The Baroness will likely end up on a shelf as a conversation peice if i can't find "the right" pack for it.

i posted this video on my facebook page and a fellow skater comments ~ "sounds like a mad scientist"  . well then , i am !. i'm not hurt by that comment . i see it as a complement . just a crazy mad most wanted scientist that never get to invent anything .

i 1st found out about electric skateboard was in sept 2014 . spent 8 hours watching youtube videos just about electric skate/longboard .
got my 24v 1st brush dc motor ready made eboard the next few days .

got my 1st brushless dc motor , dual diagonal kit at 30th sept 2015 . got it all fixed & wired up on 16th oct 2015 . dc wiring are easy to understand . when it comes to bldc , i'm new to it . thanks to a fellow eboarder  whom once in a while advices & educate me on certain times he is available .

so , in all i took SIXTEEN days to figure out which wire goes to which connectors and finally , i just gotta record my 1st spinning wheels . watch . the one with red wheels are the weak and slow HUMONGOUS dc motor eboard .

yes! they where 30-40km/h fast and extremely loud (chainsaw motor). because of the noise, all motorized skateboards / bikes / scooters where banned in California. New eboards etc. automatically fell under this law up until it was finally lifted recently to accommodate to the new technology

in singapore , you can get a $500 ticket if plain~clothes National Environment Agency officer catches you . they will wait for you to completely slow down and have a rest (sitting probably) and demand for identity card . and issue a $500 ticket .  you can of course appeal (if granted) for reduced $100 ticket . so far i never encounter any of them , police or other government agencies .

sorry for the bad video quality .   down here in singapore , most people like to stereo type . they wont want to ride with me since i'm now 47yrs old  . unlike those french engineers video ; they have a crew occasionally conduct group activity . and they wont mind skating with anyone . wished we had that kind of group here .

we have .

https://www.facebook.com/groups/1198184386874565/


just that most of us are too busy flying to  L.A .   California ,  Australia  , Japan ,  probably 3 are foreigners  working in Singapore , and local students busy with exams e.t.c .

from that point Marina Bay Sands , one can skate til the end of the island in the east , where our International Airport is located about 25km estimated distance .

in the video it looks fast , but actually its not . i was just testing on my 1st day of eboard completion . 

theres many plain clothes officer with speed check meter gun and a high definition 1080p camera  hiding . ever so ready to catch speed demon . even normal cyclist and in line skaters got a $500 ticket for exceeding the 25km/h limit . 
they always work in team of 4 to 7 officers . 1 officer at 1st point with speed gun , 2nd and third will be 100m away with camera . the rest will just need confirmation from the first 3  officer , and they stopped offender and issue ticket . easy MONEY !

same advice and scenario depicted in this video from Enertions

https://youtu.be/o_5Bh4zceGQ

some area says 25km/h , while some only 15km/h . so be carefull when in singapore parks .   just dont speed .

where i live we have so much actual crime that nobody is watching the bike trails. they're 15mph too but every single spandex coated cyclist out there is doing at least 30mph and they're doing it in packs of 5 or more. We have some serious cyclists in my area. You actually NEED an electric skateboard to keep up with them. 

I often mention passing and buzzing the cyclists but truth be told, a lot of them can't be buzzed or passed without achieving speeds requiring full armor. They're too busy pumping for 100 miles straight while maintaining relatively high speeds on their $10,000 bikes to be bothered. I do try to keep up with them though, its fun and often starts good conversations while i'm just standing there sipping a coke at 25mph. 

I also don't ride in downtown areas, parks, or other places where people are just derping around. To me that's just asking for trouble. In the past i've done so and have been harassed by pedestrians.

Yeah I understand what you mean about the excitement.. I was the same first ride!

it doesn't help that the wiiceivers come with sockets built in. maybe the next revision should have header pins instead..

good to hear that you have soldered it on now though.

Why go 80% when you can go 100%?
Why have limits?
With TB's 12s Esc's and mini RC Remote, control is very good at 100%. I can easily cruise at 5-10 mph
or 10-20mph. And quickly wind it up to 25-30 mph
30 is the fastest I've gone so far. I still haven't maxed it out.
Everyone is saying that Vesc is tops. 
But I liked the robust design of the TB's with there huge heat sinks. And quick easy programming. 
I have worked them very hard and they just keep on going with no problems or issues. They are very responsive with no lag at all.

Nah...as you learn to ride and film your shots will be more steady...nice fluid movements and frame the shot and the pole correctly...the tough part are the sweeping shots from side to side as you turn...but gives a great effect .... You will have an easier time since you will be using a session since it's super light .... I also film with my GoPro hanging upside down .... I think it's a better shot ... Plus it will naturally want to hang upside down ...

Yes, I'm planing to hang the GoPro upsidown under the pole with a curved extension to hide the pole from the frame. I know it will take some time and practice to get it down. 
What type of pole are you using? It looks like it has a pistol grip.

Not sure how well it will work. I think a longer stick could mean more shaky video. Your setup seems to be working very well.
I also ordered a snorkel mouth mount to use when I'm surfing.

Cool look forward to seeing how it looks .... Yeah you need to be all floaty when you are filming but the wide angle is forgiving .... That arch extension is pretty cool....seems to tweek the angle of the shot just right for me when I use it... The alternative is getting the Sony As100 and the newer version....those do have image stabilization...same specs as a GoPro plus the stabilization...that comes with a wrist monitor that you can take swimming....I wouldn't suggest taking the Removu in the water ...by the way they also have a GoPro type mount for the Removu so you can rig it up with other GoPro stuff  .... At the very least you can use the pole to go fishing 🐟

Just a heads up, GoPros do not have standard tripod holes. You will need a GoPro tripod adapter in order to mount it to that pole!
Edit: I didn't see the top picture, you will be able to mount your GoPro to the top picture, but not the second one with the 1/4 tripod screw!

Don't think I'm down for jumping fences.
Sorry, Don't like heavy metal.
Not sure I want to give up my age but I'm likely the oldest skater you know. Oh and I still surf when the waves are up.
I went with the laid back music because of the slow ride. 
The slow ride because I was holding my iPhone in one hand and was afraid of dropping it.
When I wasn't filming, I was going up to 30mph on one of the open straightaways with no pedestrians.
My Gopro equipment is coming tomorrow. So I'll be able to film some fast runs with my helmet mount.
And some cruizy carvy stuff with the selfie pole.

Lol have fun looking out the window for the goods to arrive...it's like your birthday again 🎉 ... Have fun reading the GoPro manual on the throne ! 

Yep the wide...the camera is not really too far from me so I need to get more back ground in the shot....play with the settings ... Also make sure you record in the compatible settings for your iPhone .... I think I film in 1080 30p ... I don't thing the iPhone can do the 60p .... Maybe in 720... Just make sure ... Otherwise you gotta edit via computer ... And "ain't nobody got time for that"!

When you record with gopro make sure you have a 60mbps mini sd card at least. If you have lower it will kind of be like a bunch of pictures that slowly slideshow if you know what I mean.

Ok, I have the Lexmar 633x 32 gb 
It's write speed is only 47 mb/s
So guess that's good for 1080/30fps or 720/60fps.
I'm gonna get the Samsung pro+ 64gb
Reads 95 Mbps
Writes  90 Mbps

I think that's what I'm going to have to do. My computer can't seem to be able to handle 1080@60fps. I found some videos on YouTube that where 60fps and they stuttered just like mine did at 1080. When I drop them to 720 @60fps, they played smooth. 
So it's either 1080/30  or  720/60
I did get one of these but I  don't it's gonna help unless I get a new computer also.

Just did a test with new sd card. 
1080/60
1080/30
720/60
My computer chokes on 1080/60  The other two run fine
1080/30 has a lot more blur with fast motion
720/60 was much smoother
Looks like 720/60 is better option for fast motion video.

Yes, but not just yet.
Shot some video today using a tripod, helmet mount and a selfie pole. Got some good frames. Just gotta edit and splice it together and post it on YouTube. 
Shot at 720/60. It came out really good at that setting. 
Flows smooth too.

Thanks for the tip Justin.
I haven't tried vlc player. The videos are in mp4. Does vlc player play those or do they have to be converted?
And what about youtube? My mac mini is choking on youtube with 1080/60.
Anyway, I shot some video at 720/60 and it looks pretty good and smooth with speed.
I just found out the iMovie will not do 60fps at any resolution so I'm considering another option like Premiere Elements.
I tried a trial version last night and it works pretty well. much easier to trim clips than iMovie. 
I was running OS X Lion and it was working well, Then I had to upgrade because of compatibility issues with my new iPhone 6s+ and go pro software. So I installed OS X El Capitan and it is choking my machine. I'm running 8gigs of ram and the system is using half of it. Guess thats how apple forces you to buy new computers every 4 years.

So, I tried to edit with iMovie but found out that it only supports 30fps. 
I shot the video at 720/60. So I went out and got
Adobe Premiere Elements14 and used it for edit. 
It supports up to 1080/60 and was much easier to edit with than iMovie.
It also rendered the movie fairly quickly into an MP4 file that is only about 188mb so it uploaded to YouTube very quickly. I played it back full screen on my 42" Flat screen and it looked pretty good and smooth.

And trying to look natural doing it....that's what makes it hard....Trying to look normal, while enjoying the ride without making filming look like work.....it can be work but the results are self satisfying .... And fun....

The gimbal is small and light. along with the Gopro sessions, its not bad. I had it on a fairly light pole and it was fine.
One really good thing about the gimbal is that it always keeps the camera level no mater what you do. So you can move the pole around all over the place without even thinking about it. It was well worth every penny!
I have since upgraded to a Gopole which is much sturdier. I sent the R1 back to amazon because it did not have full functionality with the sessions model as it does with older Gopro's like hero3. And the battery would drain too fast.
I got the Gopro smart remote which is smaller, water proof,doesn't drain its battery fast at all and lets me change camera settings right from remote. The R1 would not do camera settings with the sessions model. The free iPhone app works better than the R1. With live view on a bigger and better screen and full control of settings and media. Oh, and you can have both the phone app and the smart remote connected and controling the camera at the same time! And if you change camera settings with the remote, it updates the screen on the phone app and visa versa

Your esk8 videos always make me feel like I am watching the walking dead, your washed out colours and deserted locations gives a very eerie post-apocalyptic feel, especially considering you guys are decked out in some rugged & warm clothing, wearing leather gloves & jackets with camo patterns, all wearing head gear and various battle ready attire!... It's like you guys are a special force of esk8 riding zombie killers out looking for your next horde of undead to slice up.... you should attach your remote controllers to samurai swords!

Actually, this would make a cool b grade movie...

The Walking Dead totally needs an ESK8 character :) Although it's been warming up, today dropped down to about 35 degrees so all the gear is a necessity and I usually bring some extra helmets, pads, gloves etc. in case anyone needs it. This is the first time we rode with 5 boards and it was really REALLY fun. We're trying to grow the movement out here! :smile:

Pretty cool effect with the low light and sparks. All your videos leave me itching to ride. I had never tried the whole crouching tiger style of riding till I saw your videos, but I finally tried it today, and it felt awesome! Guess I never really had the hills or momentum to try crouching without having to immediately push again. 'Lekricity's the best!

Btw, what kind of protective gear are you rocking?

Yeah I'm still trying to figure out different techniques of riding but with high speed carving I seem to get into a crouching position by instinct. The protective gear that I wear is a Bern Brenwood Helmet, Sector 9 elbow and knee pads, Sector 9 Boxer II sliding gloves, leather joggers and sometimes a neoprene/fleece scarf.

I imagine so, he described "some asian dude with blue lights all over the bottom and he had a big blac controller". The only other small EVs ive seen in the area are a boosted dual, a yuneec, and that guy with the unicycle walking his dog.

Hi all, I just finished this build with Enertion single motor kit, a 6S battery and a 100A ESC, that's like my 5th ride on it. Finally I have a board that is reliable, my first build was with chinese hub motors and they overheated and failed (I burned 1 motor and 2 ESCs), then I watched @onloop's video on motors and decided to go with the Enertion kit, this motor is so big it can't basically hoverheat, all my rides were very smooth even if my build is a bit rough :) I will make a post on the other section soon.


This is the video:

https://youtu.be/5pwhRvsEbt4


I used a smartphone to record + a Zhiyun Z1 stabilizer, that was my first time testing it and overall I'm satisfied of the results, tell me what you think!

I was still sleepy (6am) and afraid of falling with the new gimbal or breaking it because of the rain lol.

Also this is the vimeo upload for the video because apparently the first audio in some countries is flagged as copyrighted even if is CC-by: https://vimeo.com/162171634

I should add that I got the gimbal because my previous video attempts at recording a run were very very shaky, I followed Rick's (@RunPlayBack) suggestions on gear ( http://youtu.be/bjQDM7VnwJM ) and now it's much better, I hope some day to arrive at his level of filming and editing :slight_smile: - The gimbal I got is not the same (Importing from US unfortunately is pricey for me in the UK) but luckily it is a version that has the hole at its base so I could mount a pole, I don't know if the gimbal has encoders or not though :expressionless:

@makevoid @Michaelinvegas I pretty much approach DIY camera stuff the same way I approach ESK8.  So many different ways to get to the final product that it doesn't really matter what you use, as long as you learn something and it fits within your means. There's no right or wrong way as long as you keep shooting and discovering new techniques. And while I've had my share of big budget music videos and commercials, none of those gigs really compare to capturing a genuine moment with whatever you can get your hands on. Success in videos has never really been about budgets for me anyway, it's always been about how valuable I could make myself to others.

I took my cheapo camera out while getting groceries to get a quality test. This is the best I can get from a vivitar 785hd, but it was on clearance from a pawnshop, so i got what i paid for and don't need to potentially sacrifice my phone. That's approximately 40lbs of groceries including the 5lbs of chicken in my bag. I'll get some night shots later tonight.

Would have had a second low quality video but forgot to put the card in my camera. I never realized the lights were that bright. You cut the part where I nearly lost it on that metal at the very end, I was hoping to see if you caught the slide.

Maybe @torqueboards will sponsor us with a couple of belts, I know he has my size and the shipping is close. With the three of us cruising around we could take over a whole lane on the strip. Imagine the marketing potential, we could pass out stickers or business cards into the hands of limo riders. I've ridden my bike right in traffic on the strip on a Saturday night.... Totally safe.

They know me by face because I attend NAB each year but their marketing team caught hold of my DIY eboard camera rig video so they knew I was using their gimbal to shoot. So NAB stands for the National Association of Broadcasters and it's the biggest video technology show of the year. International attendees represent every sector of the industry including broadcast tv, digital media, film, entertainment, post production, VR, etc. It's massive and super fun if you are into video. I've been posting a bunch of the latest tech [on my Instagram account](http://instagram.com/rikcordero) if anyone wants to see what they have out here.

Nice video, you go very fast on that road! 

I think that youtube converted it to 30fps, it doesn't show me the 720p60 option as other 60fps videos do I don't know why :/ . 
I think the best advantage of recording at 60fps is that you can slow down the clip at 50% and still have enough frame rate to be viewable without using smooth filters like final cut optical flow or similar. Don't get me wrong, they are useful to bring the speed even to a lower point but a higher frame rate is a good place to start :slight_smile:.

nah, I converted it in sony vegas editor. I might have been unclear when I said that I had posted in 720/60, I was referring to a previous video I had posted in that format. Dog r/c car stuff. I have just been playing around editing some 720/120fps footage I took with the new runcam2 mounted to the r/c car. The slow motion is so smooth...

I know you are an experience rider but please strap the kid harness to the front on your chest area, it's the safest position for the baby if something unexpected happens. 

When he gets a little bigger you can just position him standing on the board facing you, that's what I do with my 5 year old. 

And nice work to start him early :-)

honestly, I don't think there is any 'safe' spot.... if you fall people are going to get hurt.

but he prefers the back, also it's a better (more comfortable) place to carry the weight when riding.

Nice, that is pretty quick! Are you wearing knee pads? I've gone down at those speeds, it's not fun. 

You are working on a slide puck/transmitter? Very cool, I have thought/sketched out something like this. Put a convex slide puck on the base of the transmitter handle, maybe 3 to 4 inches in diameter.
Or, something resembling dirt bike brush guards, that wrap around your knuckles.

I am very interested to see what you come up with. :thumbsup:

I thought about the same!
It is super annoying to have the controller in one hand so you can't touch the ground.
I'm planning s.th. similar, but if you build one first I'll buy it straight!
I was thinking about a GT2B badwolf mod with thicker case and Velcro to attach it to my sliding gloves. Sadly I'm lacking time to develop cool shit.....
Would be great if you start a thread for a sliding remote and share your ideas.

I could have, but I had so much fiberglass, and the vinyl wrap is super cheap- I got a large role so that I can use it later for future projects. 

Plus, it's easy to worth with or remove since most imperfections clear up with a little heat.

Can you take the nose and tail guards off or are they glued in. Good for protection, but breaks the clean lines of the board. Also what batch were you in. The handle is anodised not the black which the first batch came in.

This board it beautiful. @onloop should be really happy with what hes done.

Yes, you can take it off (it's part of the new shipping method). I agree it looks less clean, but I don't mind.

I ordered mid February, so I was the *second* batch, but I started up the *third batch* thread since I wasn't sure if it counted as the third ( as per what Onloop said prior).

Just bumped into this video. Surprised how few views it has on YT. Looks like interesting steering mechanism.  Larger rear wheel seems like it's well suited for a hub motor.  Reminds me of Frankenboard a little.

[/quote]


Step one, Get [Maverick for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codesector.maverick.lite&hl=en&gl=us), it records all your GPS data into a .GPX file.
Step two, Get [Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.com/earth/), It's FREE now in case you didn't know.
Step three, open the GPX file with Earth and it creates the path and arrow. There's an elevation profile too, but I haven't put any effort into getting that into the video yet. 

Once you have the path loaded, select it under the TRACKS folder and click the "Play Tour" button under my small red arrow. This brings up the slider with a save button under my big red arrow. it will save your tour at the bottom of the Places list, click on the tour and Save to My Places.

Next click tools, Movie Maker. You get the option to record a saved tour, but ONLY if it's Saved in My Places.

The path and arrow only show up if you have them checked in the temporary places. Video quality settings are up to you and your system's abilities.

Thanks for the very comprehensive reply! :) I was playing around with it for hours yesterday using my gpx files in Speedtracker for iOS but couldn't figure out why it didn't do the path and arrow thing, which I assume is only a Maverick for Android feature. I'll do some digging but if you know of an iOS app that creates those TRACKS folder like Maverick please let me know. I'll keep you posted!

*update* - okay I found the iOS version that can create tracks - it's called GPS Tracks - http://www.dmsoftwaresolutions.com/

Do you have your phone in your pocket or have it pointed straight ahead while riding?

When I was at NAB in Vegas ( around the time I was trying to link up with @Michaelinvegas ) I tested out the Skywand for the HTC Vive which pulls in Google Earth data to create Waypoints for drone flight simulation - so cinematographers can map their path, adjust camera, and then save the data to use when they launch the drone in the real world. It was really awesome.

We also got to really test out the TSG Pass full face helmet which is pretty damn awesome. The joy of riding with others is really a blast which you can clearly see in Casey's Boosted 2 video.

@RunPlayBack I noticed you like to stinkbug on your board a lot. It is going to be a hard habit to break and can get you in trouble as you progress. Leads to poor weight distribution and can give you some mean wobbles if you are not careful.

@chaka Yeah, I sprained my push foot last week so I couldn't really put much weight on my back leg heel, even flexing it right now is a little painful. I probably shouldn't have been on a board but with that many people showing up I couldn't resist. My single hub with the 90mm ABEC's don't really slide and yesterday I had pretty stiff bushings on to avoid wobbling all together - mostly because of my foot/ankle and for anyone else who wanted to try the board. I'll probably need more practice on a non electric longboard with softer wheels to figure out my stance. Still learning.

I was referring to grabbing the board between your legs.  Here's a video of Cliff Coleman at a slide clinic explaining some tips on technique but if you google stinkbug grab you will get more info on the topic.  We are all guilty of it at some point ;)

So if I ride goofy and favor my ride hand for the controller, I have to switch to my left hand even though my wheels can't slide? I can try practicing that. But outside of stinkbug not being stylish for traditional downhill longboarding, I'm wondering how do the same techniques apply to the vast array of eboard builds that have a much different weight/rider distribution?
```

## \#402 Posted by: chaka Posted at: 2016-06-19T22:36:35.687Z Reads: 286

It has nothing to do with being stylish. Generally you will want to grab some rail going through a hard turn and if you are grabbing between you knees you will be at a severe disadvantage. Better to learn good form early on rather than build on bad habits. I don't mean any offense, just trying to point you in the right direction.

Very ingenious design/mod! You're kids must love that thing. 

Do you have any more detail on that front truck modification? I've been trying to figure out how to do the exact same thing for my Turbo Lazy Boy project in my avatar picture. Did you just drill a hole in the board and mount the truck kingpin through it with a plan of wood attached to the truck mounting plate?

I've seen about 8 or 9 guys riding eboards- that's more than I've seen in Jax back home. That said, I've been going all through melbourne and sydney, and some of the coastal areas in Sydney are absolutely perfect for an eboard-

Here, there are just enough hills to make a normal board a pain in the ass (downhill would be fast, uphill too steep) so electric boards make a ton of sense. Nothing a classic belt drive setup couldn't handle either. 

I think with this skate shop in particular though everyone who worked there and was in the shop at the time loved the idea and didn't think that it "threatened" classic skateboarding in any way- intact they didn't even mention it. 

So I guess it really depends on where you are.. Maybe a nice beach town in the US could have a bigger eboard population, but that's just my hunch.

It sure is Unfortunate there are a-holes like that, Seems like its an adult neighbour as well. Being drunk is no excuse for his actions, perhaps you can confront him when he is sober? He has to be made aware that his actions are not just inconsiderate and selfish, they are dangerous.

@furryfrog agreed. He is 30, full "adult"... I found out later when the neighbor came to apologize that he was a guest of the boyfriend of the resident, lol 
Being drunk is no excuse. I don't know where he lives, don't care. We have been planning a cross country road trip for months and leave in a week, nothing is disrupting that... :slight_smile:
@Mobutusan  We were visiting my mom in my hometown. Thanks, I am fine. It was most definitely a piss off. He thought it would be funny. What kind of brain damage is required to get you there? I don't think someone like that can be reasoned with...
@psychotiller I wanted to soo bad.... that is why I threw the wood in the ditch. I wanted to break his leg with it. But just before I picked it up he told me to throw it at him, that snapped me out of it when I realized he wanted some sort of redneck throwdown, win/lose, just for the fun of it... mental.

This same thing happened to be last month except on my normal longboard. I was skating through a big parking lot leaving a movie theater when I to pick up a call from a friend. As I did this I hit a curb with one of my wheels and flew off my board. A passing car caught my board under its tire but the driver stopped before my board snapped. One of my wheels now has about a 1/4 of an inch angled flat spot on it cause it scraped against the pavement. At least my board is fine.

http://pocolawyers.com/legal-services/personal-injury-claims/what-is-the-law-personal-injury-claims/who-is-at-fault-when-a-pedestrian-is-hit-outside-a-cross-walk/

According to this it would be both people's faults but mostly the driver's but with video like this I bet you could definitely get the driver to pay for repairs cause the driver had more than enough time to stop and let you pass. I just checked and that article is from a Canadian law firm so it might be different in the US.

He was not a pedestrian at the time - he was an actual part of traffic. Especially in the US with its lack of laws against esk8s I feel like the driver should not only cover the costs of the board but also get fined for the potential danger he put @Mr_Mahal in. Couple of inches more and there would have been some serious damage to his foot that could result in him never being able to walk the way he was before (granted this is an extreme case but still could happen).
What strikes me is how much time the driver had at this low speed - he was probably playing pokemon go or something ;)

That shit was clearly the skaters fault, look I've been skating my whole life, and one thing I know is regardless of my rights as a pedestrian or skater I'm always on the defensive, that dude is just lucky he didn't get his ankle crushed. Not trying to sound insensitive but please be careful,car vs skater the car always wins, and I'm not talking about legality. no matter who has the right of way.

Until skaters have a legal right to be on the road such as in California now, then I doubt a skater has any legal recourse since the car driver or police officer could easily point out that the skater had no legal right to be on the road.

And I usually am. You are preaching to the choir...i take responsibility but I was not at 100% fault regardless of it being car vs skateboard. This was not me trying to assert dominance this was me not being overly cautious, and a driver not paying attention.

@Mr_Mahal any images of the board aftermath? You may be able to buy a new deck and move all of the electronics... 

also i think that although the driver definitely had time to stop, there's no use in trying to blame them... unless you live here in Calif where they kinda favor the esk8ers

Thanks! Nice one too!  I like the shots with the sun setting at the end of the video. 

I am using a Zhiyun Z2 for action cameras and phones, it was almost the cheapest I could find that supported both cameras and phones and had the thread to mount a pole/stick. I don't think it has encoders in fact strong wind can make it unstable.

>  Cptanpanic: You said board carves good, didn't see any video of carving. Can you get some

here you go, watch the end of this video @Cptanpanic and tell me if do you think it carves enough, consider I have tightened the trucks bushings a lot, especially the motor one (back)

Here's a pretty chill session we had last night at a local high school. Some good friends of mine and their kids have never tried ESK8 before so brought a few boards out for them to test and get comfortable. There's only a quick clip of me on the Carvon V2.5 hub but I mostly had the kids riding the Carvon EMC2 and my vintage mini cruiser with the speed limited. Sessions like these are super fun because it's just about building confidence and highlighting safety in a controlled area.

Since I saw tha emc2 mini board. It is exactly what I envision a board that a kid can use and teach them the basics and get them to respect the esk8. 

Man you are always a step ahead. You are bless with the ability and have the dedication to put into images the emotional part of eSk8. :thumbsup: keep up the good work.

Yeah the EMC2 is nice board to get people comfortable with ESK8, especially kids. My Yuneec EGO used to be the beginner board but it's a little too big and bulky to transport. The EMC2 has a smooth, conservative curve on throttle and brake so as long as they can balance, it's easy for beginners to hop right on. I'd say this was one of the first times where we really focused on the communal family bonding aspect of ESK8 which is exactly what happened. The two kids didn't want to stop skating and the parents were really excited to discover this activity they can all participate in.

We had a fun ride today with the vintage mini cruisers in a newly asphalt paved, unused parking lot at a local college campus. Cops rolled by and didn't stop us. Today was a good day :) Also had a blast testing the Carvon V2.5 single hub motor which had incredible snappy torque and braking. It was even able to pull @Jeff who weighs 250+ lbs. Meetups like this make me super nostalgic.

Not for nothing you guys gotta get a better run to take....there are way too many people in that area to really enjoy the ride...not gonna lie...I wanted to cross check a few people on our run...stupid tourists lol....

When we went past Santa Monica it seemed way more open...but not sure how much further that goes...

If you are gonna come down to Venice to ride...do it at night...so much better...but keep in mind...you make quick work of the Venice and Santa Monica loop pretty fast...it's a long walk...but in reality a short ride

I dono man. Maybe in a straight line on city streets but not for carving. I live in LA so my main jam is finding the open road with no cars right now. Took it out during lunch and cruised the loop around a park avg about 15mph. It's so fun. And kind of a work out too if you're really carving!

Hey Guys! First Post here, I have spent this last summer building my first Electric longboard and it was the best decision I have ever made. I used a 230kv motor with 2 5000mah lips batteries in series. I cut the motor mount out of aluminum and welded it on my trucks. I used thin abs plastic for the cover and melted it to the correct shape. Let me know if you have an other questions and here is a video I made about the board: [My Summer Electric Longboard Project Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqHIzKqaU7I)

I rode about 4 miles over the Pulaski and up over to Kent, then up that stretch on 5th. So the board already had quite a workout before the bridge. If the board was cold, no problem, but I push past the first expansion joint then throttle it up as fast as I can, but still can't make it up to the merger. Have to push a little to get past the crest. 

Just got my v2.5 in. Haven't even opened the box yet. It'll solve any issues getting up the bridge. I'll take another vid for that.

aren't the specs released on your site? (10s, 200 kV, top speed and range mentioned).  I think the specs on your website say 28 mph top speed, but yours was 31 mph in that video as an AVERAGE over a mile.  That seems like over 100% efficiency lol.  Unless you have a conservative estimate on your site.  

Also assuming 200 kv motors, 10s, even with tall gearing an average of 31-32 mph seems really high.  Whatever you did though to get that average, I'm all for it :)  really looking forward to the freeride complete!

Yes range and top speed are underestimated. Better to have customers pleasantly surprised than disappointed. ;)

I also was testing abec 97mm flywheels so that also plays into the top speed.

They are the 90mm Abec 11 Flywheels in 75a.  I've just swapped back to 80mm Kegel wheels as I've missed them a little bit - lower top speed but they give you a lower centre of gravity :slight_smile:  Thanks for the kind words about the deck, I'm pretty happy with it - but I do want to give a Loaded Vanguard a go, purely out of interest for how those decks handle.  That's most likely a project for next year.

@Spek It's not easy to make interesting videos for other people to see. Long videos can be boring if there isn't anything interesting to see or some music. I think you did well with yours. :slight_smile:

Thanks for the feedback! Ill check out your channel for sure. 

Its definitely too long. I didn't have any time to edit and was just excited to share. In terms of the camera work, I was pretty happy with the results. I expected it to be much shakier without a gimble or anything and sometimes the selfie stick videos can be boring or disorienting. I was really trying to capture the sense of speed which I think I did.  I'll probably end up posting some edited stuff in the weeks to come as I gather more footage. 

Also the youtube stabilization went into effect overnight and really made it worse and I've since reverted it back to the original. It was zooming in and out to stabilize it and really made it look weird.

YouTube ( and any other software ) is terrible in stabilazing your videos. There is just not enough data.

I was looking around for actions cameras with image stabilization and the Xiaomi Yi 2 looks really interesting.
Great image quality and video is pretty stable. For ~ 230 eur from China not that bad.

I may overcomplicate the video edit and I don't know if the resulting video translates the time and effort it took but here are some numbers:

31,5 Km rode
3 different days riding the longboard
03h 21m 37s of raw footage (about 22,42 GB)
03h 07m 46s of pre-selected footage (about 19,4 GB)
204 selected scenes
140 final video scenes
05m 50s of video

Either way, I hope you enjoyed the video.

Will do! I had it on beginners mode and told her to softly do the throttle. Also in total she probably rode it for about 80 or 90 feet which was the plan. However I understand there are no excuses and I will certainly strap it on her next time :)

Cool "snow" (mud) flaps! ;)
Btw did you by any chance got to log how much power (watts) it takes to go through snow?

Other than that _Ah spent_ count also would be good.. at least would give some sort of comparison for power spent (based on time or distance)!

Happy riding this year then, if the snow comes ;)

@Okami:

It took an insane amount of power. Unfortunately I couldn't log it, because snow riding with laptop is not the best idea. Also my coulometer was so full of snow that I couldn't see anything.

But I can tell you that I burned down each 12s10Ah pack on 4km :smiley:

Had to stop a few times and cool the motors with snow...

It works very well and it is a lot of fun.

I just upgraded to bigger motors to get even more power out of this beast ;-)

For the last ride in the dirt, I stacked 3 sets of lipos to get 12s30Ah and rode 20km. Sounds not very much, but riding offroad in the mud is a tough workout and you're really tired afterwards...

Here is another (old) video at the same spot a few months later:

Hi, it's about 3850 meters (2.4 miles). I would like it to be bigger and easily ridable to Lisbon by longboard. Maybe in the future the authorities conclude the necessary bike lanes and connections.

LoL, I was worried about it running into a tree or worse.
It's a pretty narrow flight path on my street at low altitude.
I need to take it to a more open area like Fiesta Island so I can 
see how it tracks at 20+mph. 
It's suppose to track up to 31mph

You might want to turn your video 90deg and repost it.
If your wheels are binding, you need bearing spacers so you can tighten them without binding

Ya, they're too small. They come in different lengths.
I use these, they work better than anything the skate shops have.

Will try those out, so if these are larger, my bearings should stick out a little but correct? But if I take the wheel off the spacer shouldn't be sliding around, should be a right fit.

## \#826 Posted by: mmaner Posted at: 2017-02-26T02:31:23.235Z Reads: 188

Spacers a little complicated. It should be a snug (not tight) fit between the bearings. 

In my experience the spacers that come with buddy flywheels are too small.  I usually get them 2mm too large and then file them down a little bit at a time.  

Most people don't like the plastic spacers but I've found that they tend to perform better, but not for very long.  I bout 20 sets of plastic spacers and speed rings off eBay for around 2 bucks, don't remember exactly as it's been a few months.
```

---
## \#827 Posted by: Namasaki Posted at: 2017-02-26T02:45:53.356Z Reads: 183

```
I lock my wheels down tight with these spacers. 
Because they have thicker walls than most skate spacers they provide a very solid setup and my wheels spin for a long time. The fit really depends on the particular wheels your using. If they wind up being a little big, then I just let the wheels float on them a little because it would be very difficult if not impossible to file or hand grind them down while keeping the mating surface flat and square. You would really need a lathe to trim them  accurately.
```

I'm gonna order some of those spacers, prolly sweet.  

BTW, the way you file them.is with a jig.  I don't have a pic, but it's essentially a piece of 2x4 drilled to hold the spacer tight horizontally and th exact depth you want vertically.  Set the 2x4 between to pieces of angle iron (which are clamped to a table top) with the file clamped underneath.  Then you just run it back and forth until it stops sanding.  I do 4 at a time usually.

This also works quite well with multi cell battery packs using a BMS
Note: As stated in the video, this can only be done with a C/C C/V power supply with adjustable voltage and current.
For those who like to charge their packs below the max voltage, this is a good way to fully control the charge process.

quite early speed wobble. seems the board/trucks/bushings setup of that prototype arent made for 30mph or the rider just isnt comfortable and used riding there. :hushed:

Did you check how much they wanted for the kick starter :astonished: 
I posted it because it looked like they had took some of the best ideas and builds from this site and endless sphere, for example the direct drive looked very familiar, the deck had me thinking, is that a Trampa deck? i kinda wanted to see if anyone thought the same.

I admit i only watched it once then checked the kick starter and thought Hmmmm bet that gets canceled and one or two CEO's take a very long holiday... re-checked the kick starter today been cancled.

The rider would be me :slight_smile: and I'm comfortable at 30mph but that particular turn has a speed bump as well as a blind spot on the curve, meaning a car could pull through at any moment since we were on public property (notice that public bus that came out of nowhere). Bushings I had on were purple 87a double barrels, quite stiff for my weight. I just stood up too fast and wobbled, it happens.

ah, thought you were filming! hm, the board looked wiggly the moment you started accelerating and it went directly into speed wobble. gotta be either the propulsion system or the trucks. at "only" 30mph, my flex2 vanguard and also my new, even softer self pressed deck feel like the titanic - hail ronins! :smiley: 

the enforced truck choice is something that pushes me away most from carvon hubs. trucks are way more important than the propulsion system in my books and videos like this are not helping. :yum:

I've tried wearing motorcycle leathers while riding and though it made me feel more safe and even invincible. It made me feel  top heavy and really messed with my balance. The added weight was more than my legs are used to carrying so it prevented me from being relaxed and loose.

I has the same issue, though I was semi used to it from downhill. What I found was a hoddie with special fabric that should be quite resistant also with back and elbow protectors built in that you can take off if you want. In combination with motorsport jeans also with integrated protectors It feels quite natural and is also quit stealthy.
I could send you the links to the stuff if you wanted.

Hey bro, it was through a friend of a friend - out here in MI, it's really about who you know and who vouches for you. We did a very quick test ride but created enough of a spectacle that every racer in the house was into it. We're still in the process of discussing insurance and liability but for something like this - only those 18 years old and up can be on the track.

I don't really buy generic decks anymore, too much inconsistency.  @treenutters deck definitely does NOT feel like a generic deck.  The concave is consistent all the way through, there are no sections more flexible than others, great deck.  I've never been so locked in on a board before.

Hey guys!  So, recently I've noticed a lot of YouTubers reviewing their Boosted, Evolve, Acton, Inboard, etc.  So I thought I'd do a review of my DIY board!  I've tried my best to get all my facts straight :wink: for this video but there may be some be some mistakes here and there.  So feel free to rip it apart, LOL.  Anyhow, hope you enjoy!

Pay attention to the rapidly climbing temp. Once it levels out it will be much lower than 100 amps. Here is the original v4.12 vesc with the IRFS7530 MOSFETs moving 100 amps.

@JohnnyMeduse looks like you are using the 005ohm.bin firmware judging by the error in recording the watt usage. At 100amps the vesc dissipates 300 watts. This means you were only passing 50 amps in that video. #smoke&mirrors :joy:

Show us a video of a stable temp and current and you might redeem yourself. But if you are using the 005om.bin the video will still show double the current that is actually being used.

I could be wrong? I see lower losses on our prototype version with 12 Toshiba MOSFETS but our temps do not climb as quickly as what you showed in your video.

@electricjim79 What kind of throttle lever setup are you using? I'm trying to figure out how to do a wired throttle with these TB 12s car esc's, so I can do a thumb throttle on my drift trike, and a proportional foot pedal throttle on my son's power wheels. Thanks!

Nothing overly technical, the whole thing is made up from reclaimed bits of electric scooters so the throttle is just the twist grip throttle of the handle bars bolted to the deck with a lever fixed to it

No hate its true some people buy expensive things because they think its cool then never use it but thats true with anything. I personally love cruising on my regular long board its so smooth and carvy but my electric board gives me those down hill speeds in a state with no hills, i use any excuse to use my board, not because i spent $1000 on it but because i find it incredibly fun and liberating.

I started with a manual longboard and got tired of walking up hills.
Also I'm a surfer, so when I ride a skateboard, I like to carve back and forth like when I'm surfing.
Every time I would try to carve on my manual board, it would slow down even when going down mild hills.
So now I ride an electric longboard.
Now I can fly up hills and control my speed down hills without sliding and wearing my wheels out.
Now I can carve back and forth non stop without loosing momentum.
I would not want to go back to a manual board now.
So wether or not Electric is worth it is very subjective.
For you, it's not worth it.
For me it's well worth it.

Im also using the Metr module and app and I like it but I have compared it with my onboard volt meter and my Fluke multimeter and found that it always displays the voltage about 0.6 volt higher than it really is. 
It's just something that you should be aware of and you might want to compare with a meter on your system.

**UPDATE**
Just checked and there is an update in the App Store for the Metr app. It says "bug fixes"
Maybe they've addressed the voltage issue.

It's the same for @Ackmaniac android telemetry app, it reads about .5v lower than actual pack voltage. 

I recall hearing that the vesc itself under reads pack voltage, which makes sense, since these apps are simply relaying whatever is being sensed by the vesc.

Which also means it may be safe to lower cutoffs accordingly...

This is just how VESC measures the voltage, not very accurate. If you open VESC Tool (BLDC Tool), you will see the same value as in metr app, .6 high. If you really want to fix this on your VESC, you can check this topic http://vedder.se/forums/viewtopic.php?t=217 measure resistance of your SMD resistor and compile special firmware with your unique value ;)

Nice, I love watching videos like that, just raw videos of people riding esk8s through cities. Esk8 and rollerblading are some of the only things that make me actually want to live in a city... so much concrete!

Riding over that tape at [5:46](https://youtu.be/5_yESDXB33w?t=5m46s) gave me the horrors though, I was sure it was going to wrap around a wheel and throw you off :O

This was my first time using a selfie stick and my first time using my mirrorless camera. I really didn't want to fall and break it so it didn't hit mask speed much on the video. Hopefully I will get better at holding the camera or figure out a way to cheaply mount it to myself so I can skate a little easier.

Nice drill press. 
BTW, you should never wear gloves or long sleeves when operating rotating equipment. 
And you should never hold a part your drilling with your hands. 
You could be seriously injured. 
Use a vise or clamp to secure parts for drilling or machining.

This isn't a DIY video but a review of a Chinese board the Wowgo Board.  I was a bit reluctant to review, it was offered to me for a fair review and I couldn't say no.  Many folks are actually buying this dual hub motor set up as a way to get into the esk8 hobby.  I've found that many people like doing deck swaps with the Wowgo or Meepo...LOL whatever.  Anyhow, check it out my vid if it's your kind of thing.  Thanks!

WOW thanks so much for posting this and tagging me. That was a throw back I totally forgot about that board. 
Back in the day before vedder switches, we used breakers. And when the vesc was too finicky we used anything else. They were solid components 
Looks like you swapped out the enclosure but the rest seems the same. Nice man looking good

I need wheels :), these airless wheels slip like crazy in the cold.  At 10 deg F you can actually see a gap between the tire and the hub, they contract like crazy.  I think regular numies with low pressure would be perfect, maybe some zip ties to add adherence.

It pretty much happened at the same time. I tried to quickly avoid her. I've skated beside plenty of cars while in the bike lane so her merging into me was unexpected. Basically by the time I noticed her merging not only into the lane beside me but also continuing I was already picking up speed. As I lost my balance me and the car collided. My phone landed on her back window while recording which is what's at the end of the video. Everyone heard the crash sound which oddly wasn't really in the video and that's why people were yelling at the end.

Me Squatting and flying. @Cobber 

When I was heavy into FPV/racing I went by "DroppinADeuce" which is also the name of my channel.

The rest of the videos on my channel are pretty much all freestyle drone flying...

Slav squat... Or ass to grass Olympic without Olympic shoe handicap. But thanks! Not alot of people can go that low  with their hips wide open and no buttwink ;)

Just a side note: I started flying this way because 
- sitting made me feel like I was sinking
- standing..haha yeah no equilibrium
- squating like this is how baby's learn to stand, it's a very self centering position. So I was in the middle of my first pack flying and went from sitting and sinking to standing and almost falling over, to this squat where I immediately felt control and it stuck

So the thin pu arguments on hub motors doesn’t apply here then for the feel of the wheels?

You know it's no good for race rubber to sit on the shelf..    @sayekim. The wheels are built completely different than the PU thin thane argument.   1/4" hard density foam with rubber overlay..  Designed for  high speed high grip application..  the ride quality just happens to be fantastic.  We're working on version for the World Record board with a lower roll resistance. My hope is that they retain the ride quality but offer a better cruising option with the lower roll resistance of urethane and the grip levels of pnumatics.. time and testing will tell.

Raptor 2, maxed out settings in BLDC Tool

Almost all acceleration is full throttle and I hit top speed after adjusting my stand: https://youtu.be/0Eg0bDobu0Y?t=4m48s﻿

The one in this video was a little bit narrow and has been widened since. They are attached to the board by zip ties but they only strike the wheel under hard cornering. Despite this they work well and keep a lot of water and road crap from completely covering my legs.

Yep, those are the airless wheels.  He has never had an issue with them at speed, but as they were from the 1st batch they were slightly undersized.  I had to use a press to get them on the 6 shooters, they are are only coming off with a knife :slight_smile:.

Looks faster due to wobbly cam on a RAM mount off the top skate hole, I used a gimbal which added weight and made it shake more.

I'll lose the gimbal, that was a 50km highside

Here is a quick spin up video of @Hummie hubs on bench. The setup is using 10s4p @psychotiller battery and setup Focboxs with FOC. Have not got them on road yet due to rain however even the short time during setup seemed to loosen the grease in the bearings. I am also running at a switching frequency of 30 kHz and 100 amp max motor current and 60 amp max battery.  I think they are pretty quite no high pitch noise but you be the judge.  Would love to here from others regarding setups.

[quote="Andy87, post:1977, topic:47, full:true"]
thought with the hero 7 no gimbal neccessary anymore?
[/quote]

I wanted to have fluent movement even when I want to film in behind and etc :) No need to adjust it just follows flow :)

Well I am with full face so I don't really get any curses or etc :) But these days I ride only on bicycle paths mostly as my board is not in best condition... :) But never had issue with them so far :)

Hehe I can tell for sure that the next board wouldn't have a chanse with its 180kv 1:1 motors. Sure after 5 min it would reatch higher top speedbut then the race would be already over 😂
But it would be fun but I never seen one in the wild.

Paddling up? Sry my english isn't the best, you meant protection? Yes I have, helm, wrist, elbow and knee pads. But i gues I should buy a back protection to..

At the end of the 10 minute mark beginning of 11 minute, you hit speed. How fast? 

What festival was that going on? 

Brussels pavement and roads (minus cobblestone) is superior to SF Roads

No festival there. Just street performer. 

SF that bad huh? I guess it’s because you actually have no bike paths?

Rotterdam suburbs my hood is still my favorite.

I am told it’s better to shoot 30fps if you wan it to look fast and superview if you use the gopro hero session 4 or 5

The drone won't stay that close, it actually uses GPS positioning to the controller.  About 20 ft is as good as it gets.  I have a pretty pricey Tascam aural mic audio recorder, if you want really accurate audio.  A selfie stick or another rider is the only way I know to get that kind of video.  That being said, @sender and I have a plan to do just that using counterweighted handheld video recorder mounted to another board (mine) and a follow plan with your hummies.

Its a little scary unless you have mapped the path teh drone will take, both height and distance from target.  A tree or or house can take a drone out permanently,  

It was funny when I would pass people, the would freak out about the powered board, then 2 seconds later, they'd freak out about the drone :slight_smile:

haha! Yea I freak out most people in my neighborhood. Blast past them on the board then go to the park and zip my FPV around. I have been daring enough to do them at the same time! Maybe I'll get my friend to fly behind me and record some footage!

My wife and I really don't fit in to our neighborhood at all, its a bunch of soccer moms and then you have us, a skateboarding, loud music playing, woodshop in the garage, and then 2 tiny dogs. We are kinda odd balls but its fine.

And thanks also @Battosaii for sharing the last vid, insane edit again..

For these types of videos guys, you use small action cam only right? everything else is post prod magic ?

Now, I'm just too embarrassed to share a video after that.
my pictures are so rotten with my old cam and it broke lens.

Full BajaBoard Issues and Maintenance review. Show you the truth of living with this beast. All the faults and how to address them. These issues shouldn't stop you getting the board. It's fully maintainable. Dampers, Springs, Bindings, Tie Rod Ends, Bushings, LED light. I discuss all these issues. I love this board and it is now my daily rider replacing the Trampa board.

Edit. SOLD

Didn't think it was appropriate to make a thread to sell this since it's not entirely esk8 related. But maybe someone here would be interested?

I'm selling the DJI Osmo Mobile 2 it's almost brand spanking new. Used it once. I upgraded to an iPhone XS Max. Too damn expensive to risk holding out while riding

$63 shipped in the US seems fair

Next time take the stairs you wimp.

Pretty mad really riding on the road and weaving through traffic. I’d never want to do that but I guess you have no choice without bike paths. 

How is your camera mounted to the remote and what is it?

haha you got me. I decided to bail rather than fall with more momentum. That's my new board. One motor doesn't give quite enough traction for the big hills. Spun out constantly but still had fun. Deflating it a bit helped a lot.

Budget build to a point lol. As always these things cost more than you initially plan for. Single motor to keep the costs down.

But then I spent heavily on other things like wheels and deck so kind of a middle priced board in reality.
