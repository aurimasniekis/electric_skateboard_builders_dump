What deck are you using?
I'm searching for a mis-sized cruiser and that look pretty sweet

Nice chill music too!

Thanks a lot man! The deck is a 38" comet ethos. I love this thing, normal skating wise she absolutely shredsss. I had to try it out for a motor setup, next I wanna try the 36 or 40".   

This is one of my favorite clips.
