Hey guys just wanted to share this ESK8 promo I put together and premiered last Friday at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor. I screened a bunch of trailers before the main program and had this one play right in the beginning. We received some really great feedback and got a whole bunch of people interested in eboarding. I think the last 5 questions at our Q&A panel were specifically about eboarding lol. It was a completely sold out show and big shout out to @Jeff who attended and is also part of A2ESK8 which is our local DIY eboard group here.

Really cool and engaging video. Makes me kind of feel like we all need to start local ESk8 clubs and chapters. 

And what is Force Touch anyway?

So I create videos for a living, mostly music videos, commercials, branded content, docs, etc. - occasionally I have spare time to make a short film, usually a fictional narrative, and hold a screening where I invite other filmmakers to screen some of their work as well. "Force Touch" is my latest short film about four friends who discover a smartphone that takes pictures of the future. Here's the trailer:
