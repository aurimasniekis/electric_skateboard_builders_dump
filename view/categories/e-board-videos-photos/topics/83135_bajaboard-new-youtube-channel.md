Starting a channel. Bajaboard Raw Rides -> Some videos already posted but will be using better software to edit the videos.  Check them out and subscribe! I have 1 repair video also posted for those who have the bad rear or front lights on the Bajaboard.

Bajaboard Raw Rides - Atlanta keeps on raining but took the beast out anyway. The 10S packs are working well. I can hold 40-42MPH without issue now. Maxing out those BajaBoard Motors. Next step to install the Alien Power Systems motors for more top end and power. Board is setup really tight!
