No [man](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/scepterr), I just posted the vid because looks an interesting subject. I think is particular that someone had the desire and knowledge to attemp such a conversion. Think the guy that did it is japanese. Therefore [Nikomouk](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/nikoumouk) is right in his asumption.

Hi there.  
Would you happen to have a parts list for this?   Or a kit. I am totally interested in turning my street carver into an electric.

I second @Jagz11 question about a parts list. I just got a pair of streetcarver trucks which I'm putting on an upcoming build. Is the piston-rod supposed to help the truck return to center when steering? I know that's a bit of a problem with these trucks.

The board doesn’t self level. It’s an actual design feature that it doesn’t.  The end links are from a 5 series Bmw so easily sourced

Yeah, I found those, dust boots for them too. However, I meant that long rod in the picture above that looks like a two-way piston. I thought maybe it helps prevent wobbling.

It is a bike part.
Steering damper keeps board shake.
Later, I changed to an adjustable damper to satisfy both cruising and carving.
