So much knowledge lost. I wish they would have archived before shuttering the windows.

Added the video to watch later. 

For the life of me I don't understand why they didn't archive the content. So much useful information.

This sucks. Full of useful information. I learned a lot from that site when I was getting into longboarding.

Yeah, exactly! Same for me. 90% of my Google searches ended up on Silverfish Longboarding :)

Pretty sad. Recently, signed up and few days later can't use it anymore! :cry:
Not many people here have deeper knowledge in building longboard trucks!

And just today I was researching a deck which came up with a thread on Silverfish forums, of course. Damn.

I couldn't even pull up the Google cached version, is that not working if the site is offline??

Well, looks like that's the end of the list of companies who wheels were made by urethane manufacturers. I can't pull up any cached version of the website. Time to migrate over to Reddit.
