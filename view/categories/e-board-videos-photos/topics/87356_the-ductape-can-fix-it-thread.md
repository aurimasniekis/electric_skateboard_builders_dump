Hi fellow eskaters

After threads like https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words/2992/10261 and several other catogorized picture threads I thought it would be fun to share all the short term 'wacky'  improvements/repairs you have made :sweat_smile:

To start of I have my charging setup at the amazing fatdaddy kart event where I wanted to charge faster then 2A so I used an old computer power supply with a regulator to get 4amps (credits to @Grolletje for these parts)

When my anti spark blew it took my battery gauge with it do to proximity. 
I then replaced anti spark with loopkey. Ive got extremely limited space so my only real mounting option for the key was where my battery gauge used to be.
Since i decided to replace my enclosure for a double stack i haven't token the time to repair the gauge hole and mount the loopkey properly. 
Gorilla tape to the rescue. (Much better than ductape)
Thanks for letting me use your roll @DerelictRobot

For reasons I won't get into here, I managed to nearly kill one of my Hoyt Pocket Rockets last night. I blame the OneWheelers. We had already ditched those Utili-kilt wearing Selfie Stick wielding fuckheads but I had to make some roadside repairs to make it back to the base.

I'm fairly certain that my Unity warranty is void now because I just ripped the sensor cable savagely out of my enclosure on the spot. JST header condition currently unknown. Nobody tell Jason. 

Made it back on one motor while my jackass friends laughed at me for having no brakes and limpdick acceleration.

PPS: OW'ers are KOS from now on if they're holding a fucking selfie stick. Put that dumb shit away and watch where the fuck you're going. Nobody wants to see your dumb face on your livejournal.

You walk 5 miles across town carrying 40 lbs (18kg) of groceries, all your ice cream melting, also while dragging a super-heavy eskate on its deck because the wheels are fucked up and the motor's dragging by a wire?

Nope

No shame in catching a Lyft occasionally.  But only when it's life-or-death

There's not a ton to tell here that I haven't already. 

Basically we have a PDX eBoarding crew that does group rides. The OWers started as only a few, but over the "off rainy season" (fuck that noise, my board is sea worthy), they multiplied like vermin.

There were probably 30 of them on Friday night, completely outnumbering the 4-wheel crowd 2:1. Like a horde of ass mallards completely lacking situational awareness, road experience, and looking like they were on safari to Comicon. The number of helmet and/or selfie stick mounted GoPros was straight up depressing; it was like riding with the fuckin paparazzi. 

They just were generally in the way, running into skaters or each other. Getting lost and generally just loping around like a pack of mauled gazelles. 

I didn't ever crash because I'm a giant man and I've got a 3 wheel advantage, but being bumped into constantly and getting hit in the helmet with selfie sticks was irritating to say the least. Then I had to avoid one that stopped suddenly in front of a pack of people, and my motor took a hit on some nasty pothole/train tracks situation. Hence the roadside repairs.

I hope my newfound racism towards OWers is palpable.

And I don't want to be that guy but there was like four of them that weren't even wearing helmets.
I never started wearing one up until a year ago.
But at this point if I was putting together a group ride and someone showed up without one. I'd tell them to go home.
Especially the anger hillbilly on the meepoop.

I'm still annoyed. It legitimately ruined the ride. I'm not kidding though, like 25+ of them buzzing around like gnats, mouth agape and with zero situational awareness. I swear they all went in on a GB of mustache wax too. Utili-kilts and at least one wearing a monocle. Ugh.

I also just fucking hate having GoPros shoved in my face. 

I'm doing the typical Portland passive aggressive thing and starting a separatist group that bans anything with less than 3 wheels.
