You have to go to the limits when you want to be sure that you are on the ride way to get the best electric mountainboard 😉

WTF :joy: this is too funny!
I think the problem is that the original thread title "not for little girls" is a german phrase and would totally makes sense in german, but not in english :laughing:

Can it be that you go in the basement for laughing 🤔?!
What's wrong here is that a esk8 forum ore a Kindergarten or is it a feminism forum !?
I can't believe that it can be the most important thing on earth to get angry about that little thing that I give the post the name not for little girls ! 
Think about it that the title is not always meant that it was written! 
The title was written symbolic !!

I'm not gonna throw words like sexism or feminism around, I hate labeling people or putting a person in a single group, we are all so.much more than that. I just thought it a good idea to mitigate the title before it really did piss people off.  Should've know better I guess.

hit the nail right on the head.

you didn’t offend me with the title, I changed it before someone else got offended and started a whole big political debate...

my plan didn’t work

So which little girl got offended by my comment and flagged it? Lol let's be honest this sort of talk isn't going to offend anyone really,most people can take a joke!! Nobody crossed the line,this forums getting a little too serious! lighten up ffs

I don't have a basement and neither am I in need of one. If I find something funny, I laugh without hiding. Period.

Sure, it's an esk8 forum and not a feminism forum,, but to me it's only about being respectful to each other no matter what type of forum, right? These kinds of posts/comments aren't respectful in my world. If that surprises you, I beleive it's time to open your eyes to what has happened in at least some parts of the world in the last few decades. There are still huge differences between and within countries, so I'm not surprised that pple still use this "symbolic" way of expressing themselves.

And no, it's not the most important thing in the world, but even things that are not the worst things I could imagine, do occasionaly make me react a little. Funny, isn't it! :smile:

Uhhh.. well.. If you didn't know, these kinds of jokes actually DO offend people. 

It's not about if pple can take a joke or not, it's about what the joke is about isn't it? 

Did you get offended by your post getting flagged, or why do you call pple little girls asking them to lighten up? You can't assume that your interpretation of what's fun or not or what's ok or not is universal law.

I guess I'm just not that easily offended! I couldn't give a shit if the post has been flagged,just seems a bit petty!! 
I came from an era of listening to the marshall mathers LP at school but now these days everybody gets so offended by things and wants to kumbaya by the fire!! 
I reval in a bit of banter with the lads,I guess where I'm from people are just thicker skinned.
If I was you I wouldn't go to a comedy night ever!!

I see that you don't get it. This isn't about me being offended or not, it's about being respectful as there might be people that actually do get offended, ok? 

Doesn't really matter how thick ones skin is, that shouldn't stop one from being empathic and respectful, at least when not with your "lads". 

Thanks for giving me a heads up on comedy night. lol

I have a new weather strip on the way, was a few quid off ebay! and will hot glue the holes in the enclosure where the phase wires exit, as far as I know you can fully submerge most motors in water and there still run, just wondered what his experience was with this as looks like he goes through deep puddles!!

Ah. I thought that esk8’s were ‘allowed’ under ebike rules ? Although i have also been told you need a ‘measure’ of realtime speed. Meh. Ive heard of people being stopped and gad problems and also people being allowed to continue on their way. Have the police stopped you then ? Ps you getting WW2?

I think the law is any electric vehicle that travels in bike lanes or on the pavement like mobility scooters must not acceed 8mph,most cops are cool with it though but there's the odd 1 or 2 round here! 
Iv never been stopped...if I'm going fast enough I wouldn't anyway!
You just reminded me! When's the release date!

And some people still come around posting girls on boards !

Yeah name calling or abusive language is too far,especially online with people you have never met before,there's people getting offended over nothing here but that's out of order! 
Calling someone an asshole where I'm from is basicly saying let's fight!!
