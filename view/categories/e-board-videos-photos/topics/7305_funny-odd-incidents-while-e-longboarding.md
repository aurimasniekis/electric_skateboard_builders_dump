Here you can post your funny and/or odd incidents what you have seen while e-longboarding :slight_smile: 

Last week I had encounter with Reindeer in Finnish lapland. Reindeers are quite common sight while driving with car in lapland but I think this was the first time anyone encountered one while e-longboarding :sweat_smile:  Me and Rudolph were surprised but safe and sound.
