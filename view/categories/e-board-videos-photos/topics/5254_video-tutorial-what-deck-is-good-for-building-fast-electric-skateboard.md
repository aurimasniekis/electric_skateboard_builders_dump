I always get asked these questions:

> ## What deck should I buy to build an electric skateboard?
>
> ## Will my XXXYYY Deck work with your kits & battery?



So I made this video with some useful information that might help beginners decide what to buy from the hundreds of different decks that are available on the market. It also has some explanation about the different terms used to describe decks, such as Concave, Rocker, Camber.
