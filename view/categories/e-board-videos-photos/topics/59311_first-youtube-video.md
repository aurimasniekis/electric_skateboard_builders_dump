I just finished my first Esk8 YouTube video!

I filmed it using a GoPro Hero 6 Black at 1080p 60 FPS and edited in iMovie with the best quality settings, yet when I uploaded to YouTube the video is skipping a lot and the quality looks bad.  Does anyone with video making experience have any tips for fixing this?

Thanks!
