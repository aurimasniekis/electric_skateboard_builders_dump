Could you give some more details? Like how did you center the actual pulley, which one did you buy and so on. People should be able to reproduce what you did for this to be helpful.
Great job though - looks very nice.

Thats a cool video, I dig the way you built the pulley system.  But DAAAAMN thats a lot of work.  I can build a pulley system in 10 minutes using 3d printed pulleys and retainers with steel phillips head screws and loktite.  I imagine yours will last forever :slight_smile:.
