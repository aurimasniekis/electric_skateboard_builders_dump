Found these on eBay. Not sure what the kV or torque specs are but power wise they are limitless. Just need someone who can pour some PU for them. Group buy maybe?

Pouring PU seems like the most complicated part of this.. And what happens when you wear the wheel down? Is the hub useless or can you add more PU to the outside, like truck retread tires?

No PU needed, I just found a great deal on these at Target, it's a 2 pack for $20 (quad drive at $40? hell yeah)

>power wise they are limitless

according to [this](http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?t=22003) source they look to be about 3.6gigawatts peak, so we can safely assume they are about a million times more powerful than, say, a 6374 190kv motor

giga = billion
kilo = thousand
1,000,000,000 / 1,000 = 1,000,000
so a 3.6gw motor would be a million times more powerful than a 3.6kw motor
