Hey everyone,

I was visiting my local camera shop and wanted to buy a sweet camera for taking clips while riding.
I could not decide which one to go with and would like you to share your experiences.
The two main brands I was told I should decide in between were Sony and GoPro and my budget is max 300 Euros.

Thanks in before

It sounds like you want a small vlogging camera if im not mistaken. I dont have much experience with small cameras because I am almost never satisfied with their quality. I highly recommend the canon 550D if you can handle the bulk. It is a DSLR so it will not be thin enough to fit in a pocket, but for the price, it is amazing quality. Just look up short films made with this thing. The quality can be great if you use it right. It can film 1080p @ 24fps and 30fps I believe. Make sure you get one that comes with a lens. And because it is a DSLR you can always upgrade the lens later. I don't know the exact price, but you can shop around and probably get it close to 200-300 Euros. Also check out the canon eos M. It is much thinner, but more expensive I believe.
The 550D camera is old and has limitations though. It doesn't have wifi, nfc, gps, gyroscope, or any new camera features/sensors. It also does not have a touch screen. You have to get the new canon 700D for those features.
Sony's cybershots and canons powershot cameras are popular portable vlogging cameras, but to be honest, you could get similar if not better quality and features out of a flagship phone's camera like the one in the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 6S.
Hope this didn't over complicate things. Cameras can get very confusing.

I'm sure you could use a gopro-type cam for whatever.
Again, I'm not advertising. But the cheap ones are as good as the real deal. Http://www.wish.com proves to be a good source for actioncams. Around 70 euros with all the mounts included. Should it be defective upon arrival like mine. They'll ship you a new one for free. So double the free mounting stuff.

It's also good for arduino's, cheap heatshrink, battery cells, soldering goods, leds, electronics.  you name it. If it has a good review count, go for it! I'm additcted, I confess. (Over 100 orders now, not a single dissapointment)

That definitely sounds like a cheaper, more portable, and more durable alternative. The only reason I don't buy these types is because I hate the fish eye look. Its only acceptable for action shots. If you want to do any unboxings, reviews, vlogging, or tutorials fisheye will look quite odd. Im not sure if you plan to do any of these things though.

I started with the cheap chinese, meanwhile I have the gopro 4 black as well for multiple angles. You can swap the lens with whatever is available. So straight canvases are possible. It's also possible to remove the fish-eye with software which works well too.
Anyway, it's about 70 euro's investment. Still doesn't compare to a DSLR investment (got a canon 60D with multiple lenses too)

I got some stuff on the How to Make Great Electric Skateboard Videos thread. Some of my gear is a little overkill for ESK8. Honestly I come here to get away from the camera gear crowd sometimes lol. Lots of talking about gear and who can spend the most and not enough actual shooting and storytelling. With or without a budget, with an iPhone or an Arri it doesn't matter to me, I'm always at service to the story/emotion.

I'm a fan of DSLR's - just about any of the current gen (or even a generation back) work really well.  Pick one and you just have to learn how to use it.  

I've found it's more about the process and your skill than the actual camera.  Good lenses are worth investing in - so picking a long-term platform is really helpful.  I chose Nikon since a couple semi-pro friends let me borrow lenses whenever i want (huge bonus - good glass is $$).  

With ample light - the lens is rarely a limitation.  Start getting into low-light and it's all about fast glass though.  Or defocus control for blurred backgrounds.

Gopro is a great start if you can swing it!

I have a D800 that has never taken a single video... but is extremely capable.  I'm a stills kinda guy - w/ gopro for action stuff (paragliding, skating, etc.).  A gopro hitting the ground - no worries.  My D800 - i'd be devastated.

I've got a rebel eos1 sl1

It's pretty similar to the other canons in that price range, and I'd definitely recommend it. 

Lol my mom bought it (the white one at that) for photos, but didn't like all the digital stuff, so she went to her old Minolta from the 90's..

So now I've got it for stills and tripod videos in edition to a couple Garmin virbs for action shots <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6ea8c20028aad6c347572b7a4b7bf8bc26454fcb.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I have been using the Canon M3 for a while now and I love this little thing! It gets DSLR quality with half the size. It isn't as good as the sony mirrorless at this price point. The auto focus is a little slower then the sony. But It has a mic input, and I am a firm believer that sound is the difference between pro and armature. So the slightly slower auto focus is worth the ability to get sound recorded cleanly with a Rode video mic mini on a custom mount on the bottom so I can still flip the screen up and see what I am filming.

I still want to try out one of those 3 axis gimbles on this setup. But I might just get the go pro gimble for the shots I wanna steady cam.

Micro 4/3 is a great way to go for video - smaller body and lenses, plenty of features. I'd go panasonic for video, the G85 is great for the price point, has stabilization, 4k, and all of that jazz. There are also great Micro 4/3 wide angles if you want to go for that look.

For compact cameras the sony rx100 line is pretty crazy with 4k video, super slow motion capabilities (960fps) and so on. They just announced a new one so the RX100 IV will probably drop in price soon.

I personally think most DSLRs are pretty lacking in the video department although they make great stills cameras (see Canon/Nikon). If full-frame and video are a must the Sony has some good offerings but really expensive. The APS-C size censors range I'd go Sony too, it's hard to beat the A6300 (although there are overheating issues) on value, which will drop in price soon since they just announced the A6500. 

For Mics, just make sure you get a dead cat for the wind.

Very compact mirorrless 4k camera with 5 axis in body stabilisation combibed with an optically stabilised lens..... will be interesting.....

Otherwise you can't beat the some of the cheap (sub $90) "go-pro-like" action cams from the various Chinese companies.  I have this one and it's great. http://sjcamhd.com/sjcam-sj5000x-elite/

I recommend DSLRs by a longshot. 

Don't let them draw you in with that 150+ autofocus points nonsense. You don't see Sony Alphas in sports photography because the many hybrid autofocus points in mirrorless cameras still aren't as good as the fewer dedicated autofocus points of DSLRs. The difference gets worse in a lowlight setting. 

Video wise, the entire Sony A6XXX series is STILL getting flack for overheating in ~30 minutes. (apparently the a6500 will now give you a warning...)  For that money, I recommend getting the Canon 70d because of its famously smooth autofocus for video. 

Last thing is durability and handling... Do you really want to drop that frail mirrorless camera while going 15+ mph? Not to mention mirrorless cameras are usually cumbersome and poorly balanced for their minute weight/profile savings. Also you pay for that weight savings via mirrorless's short battery life. The specs may be there, but the practicality is not. Hell,  the entire A6XXX series STILL doesn't have a fully articulating flip LCD for vloggers. 

Just my 2 pennies

Ha interesting you mention that, looks like you know your cameras well...I have a canon g7x mk ii and gopro for video purposes.  It's great, but the audio is so bad and no external mic jack...if there's any wind just forget it.  I need an external mic with deadcat.  The exact two cameras I came down to are the panasonic G85 and the sony a6500.  

I don't like the slow contrast based AF in the G85, but it has the 12-24 2.8 lens which is awesome.  Also the ergonomics are nice.

Sony a6500 has much better AF, bigger APS-C sensor.  But it only has an f4 zoom in that range, and it has pretty bad rolling shutter (jello effect when moving camera).  

Can't decide, but leaning towards a6500 (strictly for video).  I have a nikon d810 for wedding photography, I do a few gigs a year on the side if I have time ( www.malik-photography.com )

The GoPro Hero4 is pretty nice - it's got adjustable angles so you can go full-on fisheye or something more subtle. It's also hella durable and the mic isn't _terrible_ quality if you don't have the big waterproof case on it.

If you want something bigger, I've got a Nikon D5200 with a 50mm lens that's amazing but is pretty close-up and doesn't have a zoom function so you'd need to have someone else filming from a bit of a distance.

so to sum it up a bit:

I have several different cams.
Think about what you want to do with it.

If you want an action cam type of style to take with you on an selfie stick to get wide shots of yourself riding: get a gopro that fits your budget - best action cams on the market.

if you want a good camera to take some pics also, think about raising your budget a bit to get a 700d - this one lacks on autofocus a bit, but you can handle that with a bit of learning.

other option is getting a good small camera, again i would take compact camera, a canon or sony model at about your price range like a canon g something.

or raise your budget a bit more and get a sony a6000 - beautiful camera!

Like @RunPlayBack said, "_any camera you can get your hands on is just a tool or a vessel to create really engaging content that comes from within_". The real awesome esk8 films comes from one's imagination to put every image and sound together to create something enjoyable for other people to see.

The problem I usually have is that I never program and plan the shots and picking the best ones from 60 or more minutes of footage is really what makes video editing difficult for me. And this is with only one SJ4000 cheap chinese camera which has more that enough video quality. Pick one camera and make awesome videos, that's all it takes. :slight_smile:

Also will hopefully have some drone footage, but I'm still taking it easy while getting everything down... <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/b/ebb90726b1489bdee33f740c6af9837616d3cdf2.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Little off topic, but if you want to sell your virb hit me up. I have wanted to get my hands on one for a while, but am reinvesting in Polar.

I may sell it, not 100% sure right now.. The garmin sensor data is such a killer feature. 

Haha the only reason I'd sell it is because 1080p 60fps garmin footage, while good, just isn't the same as gopro 2.7k 60fps, so flipping between the cameras in editting is pretty noticeable.... And I can't use it with the sweet gopro stabilizer.

I'll pm you soon if I decide to get rid of it

Gopro just recalled the karma, and I haven't flown it but 3 times; none of which were with conjunction with an eboard either. 

I also just **paid** and did the paper work YESTERDAY to get it legally registered, with an ID number and drone flight certificate so I can freaking fly the thing without it putting stupid limits on altitude and range.

something wrong with it?  Wondering why you didn't get the DJI mavic?

a couple have lost power in flight, government drone regulation is freaking out, so gopro had to recall them. I'm hoping it's some software issues, and will be fixed soon.. 

reasons I will **not** buy the mavic:
-worse picture quality
-also has reported connection issues (casey neistat even lost the signal on his... and he's had had more phantoms than I can count)
-doesn't include the handheld gimble which is AMAZING (perfect for eboards and makes gopro handheld footage actually fantastic- I will post a video I took with it later)
-controller isn't "all in one" and requries a phone. (I really fell in love with the gopro controller compared to DJI phantom 3 and 4 controllers that I've used in the past. When I'm at the beach, or near water, the last thing I want to do is mess with my phone- now gopro on the other hand, was a company born out of the love for the ocean) 
-no "ecosystem" I want to be able to take this drone on vacation, hike around with the stabilized grip, then pop the camera in my drone at the when I reach my destination, and maybe go swimming with the camera after that: all of that with the same $1000 dollar purchase + a battery or two.

The whole karma was just marketed as(and in my opinion is) a more durable, rugged, gopro style drone. No fancy features messing with your flying(Just don't fly into things in the first place.. I couldn't care less about obstacle avoidance), no phones to connect, and a really awesome backpack to go along with it. 

karma:
is it as small as the mavic? no
does the battery life suck? yes  (18-20 minutes on all 3 of my flights)
As a drone, gimble, and ecosystem is it awesome? **Hell yes**

edit: just wanted to mention I still back gopro, so I will just wait for them to get it right...

I just got my first drone yesterday and it has a really nice 4k camera on it that comes with a steady grip for ground footage. It a Yuneec Q500 4K. Can't wait to use the "Follow Me" mode with my new Raptor. Wish winter wasn't here so I'd have more time.
