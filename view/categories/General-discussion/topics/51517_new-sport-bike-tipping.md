So there is a new service in my City called Limebike 
http://www.limebike.com

They leave bikes all over the city and you use an app to locate and rent a bike, the app will unlock the bike when ready for use it sounds like a cool idea.

Problem is every where you look there are these bikes on sidewalks it's honestly making Miami uglier on top of making the city ugly they also clog up the sidewalks and sometimes you have no choice but to ride on the sidewalks but these ugly bikes are in the way  also in this city people do 60 in a 40 and it's normal lol.

What I have been doing is every time I see one of these bikes blocking the sidewalk I just tip it over, it frees up the side walk, makes me feel good and hopefully sends a message to the company 

Has anyone else had any similar problems

We have those around here as well. I never see anyone riding them and they are just piled up everywhere... Kinda scummy imo.

Orlando is nice area, but be careful. Orlando is the number one place for pedestrians to get ran over!

They have so much bike that if the tire get puncture, or some minor issue happend, they just dump it in one place  together and leave it. and bring out new one. Chinese Gov wants to have clean city reputation, so they funded this project. Tho they pushed too far XD.

Recycling the bikes will be easy enough.

But tires don't recycle.

Used tires are used as playground cushions, asphalt filler and one cat used them in a volcanon on April fool's to make everyone think an eruption was iminent.
