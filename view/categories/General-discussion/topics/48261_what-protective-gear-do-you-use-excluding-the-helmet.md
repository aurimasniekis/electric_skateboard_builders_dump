I think its funny that y'all think it's funny... And  some people I ride with didn't take it seriously. Lol

If you ride/cruise above 25 regularly you pretty much should be wearing gear, all the gear you can. At the end of the day you may not think I look cool. But when I go down I get back up and keep skating without the pain and with all or most of my skin. Lol. 

I get it, some if you guys only cruise 10-20mph. Guess what ? Most healthy people can sprint at 13-17mph.  So I understand not wearing all the gear. As you can likely bail easily. Hell even I don't, if I know I'm just strolling around the neighborhood getting fresh air for a second at low speeds (under 15).

Or as I mentioned earlier skating analog. Lots of times I'll go 30 down my hills in the development with just helmet and gloves. But I know all I have is me, the board, the trucks and the wheels. I feel it. I am in control. 

With esk8 there's so much random stuff even with a reliable board that could toss you off.

Asphalt and bones at speed don't mix. Protect them. Skate another day.

As long as it's lightweight. The main problem with motorcycle helmets is weight and small field of view. 

But if it's light(sub 1300 grams) and most helmets don't fit your dome piece. A helmet is better then no helmet.but heavy helmets make neck injuries more prone

Cursing With a chance of small hill gets me Slide gloves, Pants that will save skin and helmet as always. and I hate wrist guards I know there good but there so uncomfortable and I cant wear slide-gloves with them! so I learned how to fall correctly without Breaking wrists works well (don't ask me how I know). And most importantly @Deckoz  your gloves are sick :heart_eyes:

Yea. The Sector 9 Lightnings are some of the best gloves available.

Full 1.7mm hide leather. Neoprene fingers instead of kevlar, knuckle guard. Tight fitment (I hate loose gloves). Perforated for hand sweat. Yep I love them. They're super durable

My top gloves are
- Sector 9 Lightnings
- Sector 9 Thunders
- Sector 9 Boxer 2's
- Rayne High Society v2 aka Murder Gloves.

These are all form fitting gloves. If you like loose gloves
The loaded Freeride v7 are good.  But most loose gloves fall apart easily.

Lol after yesterday... I want one lol... The high side landing on my shoulder blade/spine protector overstretched my upper bicep tendon,  coracohumeral ligament, and have a swollen subdeltoid bursa from being smooshed against the acromion . Impact was to the rear of the body but overstretched these on its way to a dislocated shoulder pushing out the front.  

![FG08_11a|493x500](upload://vBN9g3UvjPFsnji2JVXW1YZ8PRC.jpg)

I'm actually trying to find a shoulder pad now. That can be worn under a kevlar shirt...for my leading shoulder as this is the 3rd time I've injured it. Lol

Damn lol...after seeing the amount of shoulder injuries from MTB and MX, I started wondering if it was a good idea to do it for esk8 too...that answers the question.

Though...some recommended hard plastic protectors too, so during an accident you can slide a bit. Not sure how viable this is though for shoulder and back protectors.

But yea I was looking at possibly switching the upper body to a Leatt 5.5 Body protector. As it is polymer dough padding with hard shells... Ce lvl2 chest back shoulders. And ce1 arms.

Under a fresh kevlar shirt. Although I'd like a little more rear shouler (Teres minor and major and Lat coverage) on my lead shouler

Hot damn 40 feet! Yeesh man at least minimal road rash right? At least you're walking and standing tall for another day!

Motorcyclists were talking about how people said they looked weird with all that safety gear they wear...but their response usually is that it's a small price to pay for being able to ride another day.
They even recommended hip protectors, because of road rash and an impact to the hip can cause damage to the spine.

And I just realized...that rhymed lol.

I had 0 road rash. Ruined a  kevlar hoodie, bured a hole in the ass of my jeans, ruined the spine protector and a tsg pass.  Walked away with a sore shoulder. Yea I tuned ~600 on protective gear...but Pads are always worth it even if you look like your going into battle... Nothing that I can't just repurchase. Better then the other option....

Some helmets have EPP "Expanded Polypropylene" That allows it to have multiple impacts.
Most helmets today have liners made of EPS (Expanded Polystyrene), a great shock absorbing material, but it will be permanently compressed when absorbing an impact, Now I'm no Helmet Genius I just head of this thing googled this source for you and copied it.

Wow...a little self-righteous much?

I'm noticing a pattern here...and I find it a little upsetting. At mentions of people calling this a hobby, you for some reason take it as a personal slight and take it upon yourself to jump down their throats. For some, this is both a toy and a tool. Some, a toy. And others, just like yourself, a tool. But remember, in the end everyone should be considerate and respectful of each others' choices. Attacking others because their opinions and views don't match yours isn't right.

And I'm going to not get too deep into environmental impacts...I could go on forever about that. Just two words: moderation and consumption.

Possibly. As impact was at the Teres and upper Lat.

![back-exercises-for-a-big-and-strong-back|498x337](upload://uFDQoONStv9tVBFh4HDhrsb8GBS.jpg)

48 hours later, today, I can lift and move my arm in all directions now that some swelling in the subdeltoid bursa has gone down, while still extremely sore,I should be fine in a week or so.

The Teres and upper Lat seem to be exposed in most upper body protective gear. .. so kinda a big gaping hole  to be smacked if you get high sided on a shoulder.

I've noticed that. Maybe because it may interfere with mobility if companies put armor there? I'm assuming tech hasn't quit gotten there yet.

So far, I've noticed the Fox Titan Sport jacket and the Knox Meta-Sys back protector seems to cover a little more of the scapula area than most. Could give those a look if you want.

I would assume it's because yes it's for mobility as most are designed for bikes while you hold handle bars so you can turn left and right. 

Not so much for skating. My hands are behind my back and hardly ever move when I skate.. I could see a skate version with extra padding over the Teres and upper Lat.

I use these elbow guards as well as knee/shin guards. 
Doesn't feel hot at all, and does not limit body movement much. 
I'd recommend this, because its comfortable, and looks like armor!

I need recommendations on shoulder protection. Been shopping around but I couldn't decide on what to get.

So yesterday, went for a ride with full gear,![20180503_110505|375x500](upload://bR3rpIhBrGGshJbN81vVnqhdZpR.jpg)

Well, not really full gear because I don't have body armor yet. 

Anyway, so I crashed, loose gravel on the road. Big cut on my thumb because I decided to use the half finger gloves instead of the full ones. Not a scratch on the pass or lower body,  a little scratch on elbow pads, wrist guards took a beating. Right shoulder took the impact, a little road rash and broke my clavicle. 
So, now, it's a little late for the shoulder protection but I wouldn't be riding again without it.

I picked this up last week for riding on my commute. It's light yet durable and comes with elbow, shoulder and back armor. Add some knee pads, slide gloves and TSG pass helmet and I feel well covered.

Speed and Strength Rust And Redemption Armored Moto Shirt

I got one of these for summer. Have about 2 weeks of commutes on it.  Great! Not too bulky on the public transportation legs of the trip, and flows air nicely for hot summer days. I think a good compromise between comfort/convenience/protection.

Thanks @michaelcpg!

@Adam0311 That Demon body armor looks really nice. Does it actually survive a fall on asphalt though? I'd assume the fabric would get torn to pieces. I mean, better fabric than skin, but I would still prefer not to buy a new after each crash. I'd be grateful if you could share your experience. Thanks.

I’ve fortunately only take one high speed spill while wearing the gear and it survived with couple of small abrasions on the elbow and shoulder, but no tearing. It’s tougher than it looks. Most importantly I popped up from a crash that could have easily broken bones with nothing sore and not a scratch on me.

I've just ordered a set of DEMON S18 - D30 Wrist Guards Flexmeter Double Back - Impact Protection.

Not sure how they will go....the wrist can flex the fingers are open for the trigger finger and you can slide on the palm guard I hope lol.![s-l500|500x500](upload://1ubfrWS2CnYaYj9LImzyW3gG3Rh.jpg)















I also have a Dragging Roo Hoodie thanks to @michichopf who's Topic "Riding tips, introduction to high speed skating". That armoured hoodie  has already saved me once from serious injury. Unfortunately I wasn't wearing two weeks ago came off and dislocated my shoulder rotator cuff.
Who's the dickhead now mars...that won't happen again. Just ordered a JSG Pass and have good quality elbow and knee guards. As @Deckoz says if you got the shit wear it and give yourself a chance to get up and walk away. It doesn't matter what you look like or how long it takes to suit up ….you only get one body.

I was on the way down faster than you can blink...still not sure what happened.

You weren't wearing body amour?

Alpinestars Mx Bionic Action Black Red Off Road Motocross Body Armour Jacket
Probably the best bit of kit I've seen...The Draggin Roo Hoodie also.


My Acromion....I think shoulder rotator cuff..haha...that bit....is sticking up now 5..6mm from a dislocation 8 weeks ago. Same shoulder...I wasn't wearing the Draggin Roo Hoodie.

Getting all sorts of impingements catching grabbing...not good lol

Under $45 shipped, built in/changeable armor, doesn't make me look like a futuristic GI-Joe. I fell low speed ~10 miles an hour. Landed on a padded area skid a bit, nothing hurt, nothing ripped. I wear this, a helmet, and padded finger-less gloves.
