“The TRACK1 was developed to give people the freedom to ride various terrain. We created the worlds first compact off-road capable vehicle, small enough to fit in the back seat of a car, powerful enough to shred up steep hills. The TRACK1 is designed to go where no board has gone before. The track-drive is the first of its kind, extraordinarily unique due to the traction of a tank combined with smooth handling. This is an all-season, all-terrain board.”
