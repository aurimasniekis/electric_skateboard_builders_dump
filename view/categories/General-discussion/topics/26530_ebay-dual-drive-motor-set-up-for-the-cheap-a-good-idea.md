I was looking for wheels on ebay and I found a 1500W dual drive setup for 140$ USD. http://www.ebay.ca/itm/DIY-dual-1500W-electric-longboard-drive-kit-83MM-wheel-7-trucks-CNC-mounts-/322549102279?hash=item4b196cb6c7:g:I0UAAOSwbtVZOttQ There's the link, anyone have any opinions about the quality or the overall product?
