Hi all - just getting started with my first build.  
marcmt88 did an amazing job on my oddly shaped Hamboard trucks.  http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/custom-made-cnc-motor-mounts-available-for-sale/32342/356

Question on motors:    Looking at these products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-260kv

Are they semi water resistant?  If you ride through a puddle or something?  They seem to be kind of exposed...  anyone do anything to protect them?

Motors are waterproof by nature due to the phases. Three phase brushless dc motors can run under water.

Sensors may need to be conformal coated.
