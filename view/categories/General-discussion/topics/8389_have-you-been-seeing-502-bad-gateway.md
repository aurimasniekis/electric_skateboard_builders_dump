Not since the great crash of 2016... Are you still living in fear since the incident?

why isn't this thing on dreamhost or something? is it running on a homebrew nginx server? If so, that's simultaneously awesome and kind of odd.

I haven't seen that error for ages. I did change my DNS settings though and that seemed to fix it. The website is incredibly slow though, have you guys noticed that? @Michaelinvegas @sl33py
