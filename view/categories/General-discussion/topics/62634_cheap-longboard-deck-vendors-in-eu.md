Hello! What are some good/cheap longboard deck vendors who ship around the EU? More specifically looking for drop thru decks, also plain wooden ones are fine, I'll be wrapping it in carbon fiber wrap anyway.
Thx in advance!

Two Bare Feet have some good looking decks, but they only sell completes. Otherwise Amazon.
