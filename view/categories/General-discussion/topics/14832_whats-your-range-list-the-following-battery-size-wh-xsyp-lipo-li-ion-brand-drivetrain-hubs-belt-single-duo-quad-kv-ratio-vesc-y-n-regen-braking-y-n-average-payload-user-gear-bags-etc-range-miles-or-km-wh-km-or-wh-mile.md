What's Your True Range? Talking about going out and riding your board not theoretical numbers you calculated.

There's been a lot of talk about ranges and what's doable for what set up under what circumstances and so lets but an end to it. Here post your specs and your range so that we, the people of the forum, can see what type of performance to truly expect from products that are available. Vesc settings are not posted because we all dont have VESCs and there would be way too many things to consider. For hub motors, your ration is 1:1 as it is direct drive.

Just copy the following and replace the text with your stats.

**Build Type:** (DIY/Commercial(If commercial, name the brand and model))
**Battery Size:** (Wh, xSyP, LiPo/Li-ion), 
**Drivetrain:** (Wheels,Hubs/Belt, Single/Duo/Quad,Brand and Kv, Ratio), 
**VESC:** (Y/N)
**Regen Braking:** (Y/N), 
**Average Payload:** (User + Gear, Bags, etc.)
**Range:** (Miles or km, Wh/km or Wh/mile), 

**Comments:** Any additional information that might be relevant. How flat it is where you ride, do you have accelerate like a mad man, do you coast often, etc.

Here's mine:

**Build Type:** DIY
**Battery Size:** 444Wh, 8S6P, Li-ion, Samsung 18650 25r
**Drivetrain:** Kegels, Belt, Duo, Turnigy SK3 260Kv, 15:36 
**Regen Braking:** Y
**Average Payload:** 220lbs + 20lbs = 240lbs
**Range:** ~41 km, 10.83 Wh/km or  25.63 mils, 17.32 Wh/mile

**Comments**: It's quite flat where I board around. I dont accelerate hard, usually push on start up. No elevation changes, pretty smooth paved campus so I dont add 10% to my numbers for coasting down hills.

That was a mixed chilled ride with some full throttle runs but also carving rides. When i go hard i can go up till 12 Wh a km. But most of the time i stay below 10 Wh. Like to carve between 30 and 35 km/h. The values you see there are also summarized for the 2 vescs (Dual).

@Eboostin
Just a tipp. You could set your cutoff voltage to 2.8V (28V) or at least 3.0V (30V) for li-ion cells. Under load they are completely empty at 2.5V. Becasue at a cutoff level of 3.37V (33,7V) you use roughly only half the capacity of the cell under mid load. So you would gain a couple of miles.

Thanks for the tip, that is how I have my DIY boards set with a BMS cutoff at 2.9V. VESC cut off is 3.1v.

Unfortunately, the Evolve ESC is what controls the voltage cutoff and I am not aware of anyone that has been able to modify it.

I would say you dont charge your batteries till max.. or something else is wrong.. cutoff for battery does not seem to be that low. so hard to speculate.

~4 ah at 44.4v nominal = 167.6 wh
Should be around 17km
Or 10 miles i think

**Comments:** pretty flat here as well. usualy start the board by giving it a kick first. even though my baord can do +40km/h i barely drive faster then 25km/h. not much breaking and accelerating envolved here since my default route is far away from traffic.

@JuniorPotato93 could you add something like 'specify which ESC you're running and in which mode (VESC/FOXBOX/VESC6)'. So people can see how everyone is doing on BLDC/FOC in combination with a certain battery setup?!

Turnigy nano-tech 4500mah 6S 25~50C Lipo Pack
 https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-nano-tech-4500mah-6s-25-50c-lipo-pack.html?___store=en_us

Unless there is glaring issue with the battery I'm leaning towards rolling resistance. When I crank down on the wheel nuts the wheels do not spin very freely despite having spacers installed.  Not sure why that would be since they spin quite well if I hold the bearing b/w my finger and spin the wheel by hand.

No one posting stats on total weight. Not a very good survey if trying to find a range. This is one of the most critical factors.

I've found before that, although you have spacers, sometimes the bearings don't go all the way in to their seat, which means when you tighten them, and the centre feels tight, there's lateral pressure on the outer rim.
Try pressing in the bearings more to their seat and then tighten up the nut. If you do that then the centre part of the bearing should be the only bit with lateral pressure and will help with rolling resistance.
