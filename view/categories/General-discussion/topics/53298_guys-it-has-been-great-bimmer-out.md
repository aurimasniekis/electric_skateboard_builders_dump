So guy's I love this sport/hobby but after I finish all orders I am going to be out.
This month has been a crazy chapter in my life I managed to total my Car, knocked up my wife and was just offered an insane Job offer I cannot turn down.

Anyways I will be traveling to all of our Nato partners regularly and will not be able to make sales or further pursue anything ESK8.

Maybe I'll be back with a bang when I retire but for now I'm done.

I have 4 Hummie decks on their way I have a old build that is just laying around Deck trucks mounts and motors. 15 hw 6.4 PCB's and like 20Stm and DRV chips for them left.  All of which I want want to part with.

I going to finish this groupbuy and a couple batteries and then I probably be online very very randomly.

Best of luck with healing, homebuilding, and your business. Let us know your desires for parting out your future kits. I for one am interested in some of the offerings. I'm sure we'll all still be here should the opportunity rise for you to come back, but family and health should always be first!

I've only seen you here on the forums for a short while. But while you were here you've been a great asset. The new employment is going to be the easy part. Dealing with a pregnant wife can be crazy! Good luck with that! Glad you made it here and have done what you've done. Thanks and good luck on your new chapter! We'll see you again I'm sure. This sport is hard to let go! ;)

Congrats man! I just had a kid, 9 months old and I'm in love. 

On the other side, dealing with a pregnant lady OMG! That's the hardest part, ohhhh no, my mistake, the hardest part are the first 6 months after the baby is born, the baby becomes the center of her universe and everything else does not matter, but remember they are just hormons! It will be better after that, just stick with her!

@bimmer , I still haven't received anything I've paid for. I gave you $430 of my money, my phone number and, according to you, I'm close enough to drive over and drop them off. I just started the claim process on PayPal because I've been left with no other options. This is not the route I want take. This is my hobby so I'd prefer to skip the headaches and just enjoy myself wouldn't you?

Yeah I went back and read a bunch of posts and it seems a little fishy. But it appears he would of designed a vesc 6 derivative produced at least 10 pcbs and kits (if not more), there was an odd lacking number of photos of the kits or pcbs for them so maybe something happened and he couldn't get the pcbs anymore? Seems a little strange nonetheless

I‚Äôm almost certain his name isn‚Äôt Lydia so probably he has used his wife‚Äôs PayPal a/c and I think he simply isn‚Äôt checking in anymore and traveling for work, dropped esk8 and ghosted.

 His wife is having a baby and may not be responding to the PayPal cases, interested to know if that‚Äôs the case

Not particularly a good way to tie up the ending and leaves those who friends and family paid in the lurch, just agree to a PayPal services/goods fee or this can happen, It sucks I know from experience
