Not really interested in riding this thing but I fancy trying it on auto follow to carry my groceries or whatever  :sunglasses:

again, all and I mean all of these product previews that claim self following are faked for these type of videos (see lily drone) it is an incredibly hard problem to solve - my advice is don't buy this if you're interested in the auto-following feature.

I've tried to ignore the 'follow me' feature for a little while yet, this was from 2016 and was an epic fail on all of them
