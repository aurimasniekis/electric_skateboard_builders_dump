I’ve seen this remote, but it looks really cheap! I don’t want a cheap material remote, I want something that looks good too

It's the only remote I have used for 2 years and it hasn't yet failed me. No dropouts ever. It's available on eBay for as low as $18. I have 2 boards with 2 of those remote.

You have to modify the Mini Remote yourself :stuck_out_tongue:

They don't call it DIY for no reason.

Seriously though, the batteries last such a long time even when not rechargable.  You want the Mini Remote.  It's exactly what you want.

The mini is great. Guts are tiny, fit in anything. Battery lasts weeks.

I have the APS remote.
It has a very sensitive throttle.
So I with my fat fingers have some problems to us the breaks without to fly from my board. Other people seem to have no issues but for me it´s not fit.
You also can pair only one receiver, so in case you plan to use 2 or more receiver, that will not work.

If somebody is interested I have one for sale :rofl:
used only once but shipping would be only after new year....

 ;) shipping to US is not that much expansive.
But better get it from ebay if it´s more close and more cheap.

If you're okay with a thumb style remote, Benchwheel is having a 15% off sale now. That sorta makes it cheap-ish.
