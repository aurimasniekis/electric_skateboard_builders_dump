Haha I'm middle-aged (46) and would love to know why you think the typical electric skateboarder would be middle-aged. Income allows better toys? :D

This is exactly like my neighborhood haha. I only started building this damn skateboard because I couldn't afford a golf cart like my asshole neighbors. You better believe I tear it up on their golf cart paths at night. Been meaning to post a video of my golf course ride. Son just happens to be getting a gopro for Christmas... Convenient

Tom Scott is one of my favorite youtubers and he's been doing a stretch of videos based in my home state. I saw this video and thought the same exact thing for it being paradise for eskate. I already knew of this place, but it just never really occurred to me about skating on it.

We in Croatia have a few islands where your not allowed to drive cars or basically use gasoline so everything is electric, and all the people there are old Croatians who lived in America as they emigrated there.
example: island of Molat idk if you will be able to find much pictures
