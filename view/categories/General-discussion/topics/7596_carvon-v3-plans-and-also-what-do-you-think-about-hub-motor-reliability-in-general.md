I've only had belt drive boards (4 of them).  They've worked out well for me and have taken all sorts of bumps and vibrations.  

I currently have two belt drive boards which I totally love.  But they are so similar, so I decided to sell one of them and get a hub motor board.  I think a belt drive and hub motor board would complement each other well rather than have two belt drive boards with the exact same drive trains.  I just hope I'm not making a mistake going to hubs... I really LOVE both my boards and it will be hard to let go when I sell one of them (raptor or LHB custom).  

Here are the hubs I'm going with, the Carvon V3 which per Jerry from Carvon will be available soon.  These are really intriguing, they're not really your traditional hubs.  The ability to just snap on a flywheel of any size, and being able to switch from 83mm to 90mm to 97mm is awesome.

I'm just curious about how these will hold up durability wise, when you go over bumps/cracks.

Don't sell your Raptor or your LHB. You will regret it later. 
Just buy the hub motor set and mount it on one of your existing boards. Then if you decide you don't like it, you can pull the hub motors back off and sell them here. If you love them, you can sell your belt drive train or keep it for backup.

The Carvons come with very high quality ceramic bearings that can take a lot of punishment. 
Warranty and service at Carvon is world class.
If you want lots of torque for hill climbing, get the new ver 2.5. 
If you ride mostly flat and light grades and want to go crazy fast try to get ver 2.0. 
Talk to Jerry at Carvon before you order and I'm sure he will be able to accommodate.

I think hubs and belts can co-exist fine in any collection. I wouldn't really put one over another because there's so many situations where either one may have a slight advantage over the other. However, guys like me or @Mrmoonlight who don't weigh that much, Carvon hubs are a blast, especially the V2.5. I've had my V2's since December and have rode them through some of the worst road and weather conditions in downtown Detroit, parts of A2 and Ypsilanti and they are still going strong. These hubs are built tough and are not just for sunny cities that never get snow.

Photorph are you going for 4 hubs?

Any info on the V3 pricing? what KV?

Maybe you can get speeds like the NGV

That new design solves a lot of issues like thin urethane causing a rough ride.

The version 2 is the one to get high speeds like NGV. Even a 10s could reach 66 mph theoretically on a full charge. v2 is 149kv, v3.5 is 85kv, and I believe v3 is 119 kv. so v3 would be more in the mid 50s I believe.

@Namasaki I'm looking at version 3.0, not 2.5 or 2.0.  The version 3 are 85 kv hubs.  I'm in touch with Jerry already.  I would love to keep both my boards, AND buy the hubs...but money doesn't grow on trees.  I have a buyer who REALLY wants one of my boards to the point where he was willing to drive 10 hours to pick it up.  If I can get almost full price back, I can basically do a full build with carvon v3 hubs for very slight additional cost.   

@RunPlayBack I weigh 140 lbs, so not much at all.  That's why I'm thinking hubs may be a good way to go, and as I'm sure you know MI has like no hills.  Ann Arbor maybe has the steepest hills but still laughable for either of my belt boards.  

@CSN going 4 hubs would be nice, but too costly for now.  Jerry from Carvon also mentioned 4 hubs but then he recommended just doing dual.  I don't have info on V3 pricing, I will get it as soon as he is done testing his prototype.  He will have them available in 1-2 months for everyone.  The new design is amazing, just being able to put on a flywheel with ease... pure awesomeness.

@evoheyax Jerry mentioned the V3 is 85 kv, he didn't say anything about a v3.5 vs v3.  But if v3 is 119 kv, that's good for me cuz I'd rather have top speed since I'm riding flats and am pretty light.

@popopopop yea he mentioned 90mm for v3, I want either 90 or 97mm.  Not 83 mm, so that would work out for me.  I guess in V3 you can swap the flywheels right because they are interchangeable? 

This board will also have @longhairedboy deck/enclosure and his 12s4p pack again, dual chaka VESCs again likely.

I commented on Carvon's FB page and he said V3 will be 90mm. I was hoping to down in size too or at least stay at 83mm w/ interchangeable wheels. Maybe I misunderstood.

Ver 2.0 is what I had. 
It was 145kv and I ran it on 12s with 90mm wheels. At 185 lbs I got it up to 33mph on flat ground. 
At 140 lbs, you could possibly do 40+
Ver. 2.5 is 85kv for hill climbing torque but with a substantial loss of top speed. 
Ver. 3 appears to be same as ver 2.5 but with a wheel hub upgrade. 
If your looking for max speed, I would recomend to se if he can build you 145kv like ver2.0

Problem with speed calcs is they don't factor in load like rider weight or wind resistance. 
I seriously doubt that going 66 mph with ver 2.0 and 10s is at all possible

From what Jerry has said, V3 will have different trucks to accommodate the motor+wheel, but performance-wise, should be similar to the v2.5. At 140 v2.5 has plenty of torque. When it comes to speed. How fast do you want to go? If you're happy with the speed on your belt drives, then you will be happy with what you can get on the hubs. 35+mph is really fast on a skateboard and I'm quite confident you could get there on either of the hubs. It's just that the v2.5's will get there much faster. 

We're you thinking dual or single?
```

## \#12 Posted by: Photorph Posted at: 2016-08-13T18:43:37.837Z Reads: 403

```
Dual for sure.  I am hoping it goes faster than my belt drive dual.  With the 16/33 ratio I have on mine along with 12s pack, I have no problems maintaining at 33-34 mph.  I've maxed out around 37-38 mph on strava and other iPhone apps, but in reality that may be slightly inflated.  

Yep, I know anything above 25 mph even is really fast.  But if you have seen my YouTube videos you know I have perfect roads and straight aways.  Plus I have some pretty insane safety gear (armored motogp race suit as my top line protection that I can use on motorcycles, downhill, and esk8).  So I like to push these boards to see what current DIY components can do.  And from a hardware standpoint @longhairedboy put my last rocket together, and he makes sure every nut and bolt is done up perfectly.  I just need the software (VESC settings) and components to behave so I can continue pushing speed boundaries.

I don't think it is either, but with a 12s and a light rider (not me), 50's is possible. My point is that's the no load speed, and I would want to be in the upper 50's if I wanted peak efficiency. Since I'll never reach that, I use more energy (which means shorter distances I can commute) and more heat in the vescs. This is why my carvons on on the shelf and I've been riding hummies hubs. But I would like to get a fast board up with a 4wd carvon v2 :)

When I rode Jerry's single, I got up to somewhere around 25mph. Got there exactly like it did on Jerry's speed vid, but a little bit faster since I weigh less. I wasn't even pushing it and I could feel that it had plenty of power past that. LEVer would have to chime in on the theoretical top speed. Maybe Rik has pushed the v2.5 faster? With how easily the single got to 25, I don't see why you couldn't do 40 with a dual as long as the motors go that fast.

[/quote]

they are similar not because they have the same drive trains, but because they are both very stiff boards with a kicktail, with a similar wheelbase and identical trucks (pretty much).

If i were you, I wouldnt try to change the drive train, but something that actually makes a difference: the board, maybe the trucks, possibly the wheels, eventually the battery.

could have a comfortable long distance tourer with focus on comfort and endurance, a small wheelbase shortrange trick board with focus on lightweight and agility, a stiff highspeed high current downhill board with focus on speed and power and finally a mountainboard for urban and offroad binding fun.

these would actually complement each other - but changing the drive train doesnt change anything imo. it will still be pretty much the same boards from a riding perspective!

no, I havent  - Ill try one day and if I do, then most likely with your 90mm flywheel sets! :relaxed:

I just cant see how it will make a substantial difference (at least for me and compared to the difference a board, trucks and wheels make) - my preferred style of riding is: something brings me up to my preferred carving speed in a way I nearly dont care about and then I just want to stay there for as long as possible. the only difference I would expect is: hubs are probably more silent and the comfort & grip of the wheels would probably feel a little worse - hardly noticeable with your sets, a lot more with hummies/jacobs.

in the case of @Photorph with more or less identical boards, I dont really see the point of switching one to hubs and expect them to complement each other in some way. so the hub version would coast better and might be faster ... what will happen then is: the hub board will probably become his favourite and the other one will never be ridden anymore, because these 2 boards will simply never complement each other. one or the other will simply be better at everything a stiff kicktailboard can offer. ;)

I'll do the 116 kV V3s. Need them for a build asap.  I'll have @longhairedboy get started on the deck/enclosure once I know when these are available.  Any update on availability?

Also undecided on 90mm vs 97 mm.  Wonder if hills will  be an issue with 97 mm running dual 116 kV v3s.  But anyway from what I am seeing it will be easy to swap out flywheels.

After riding hubs, I don't think I can go back to a belt drive. The drivetrain just feels much more responsive. I don't really care much about a high top speed, but they are very quiet and coast better. Like LEVer said, belt's have drag. I never really noticed it much before, but after riding a hub, I felt the difference.

While I'm waiting for Carvon to get these V3s developed, does anyone know where to find 97mm Abec 11 fly wheels in 75a durometer?  I'm planning on using those with the V3, unless @LEVer feels strongly about the 90mm wheels.  


also, based on this calculator @makevoid made... Using 12s and the 97mm wheels, this build will have a top speed of 56 mph and ~50 mph weighted.  Is this correct??

@LEVer  Pedi, I have 1 curious question, since the Carvon are CNC machined by you, how do you get it to be like "fully balanced" or "balanced"? All brushless motors and hub motors needs balancing right? So the motors would not vibrate or ran out of alignment or something Balancing as in like car tires needs alignment and balancing, those kind of balancing. I'm just curious, coz i'm getting myself a homemade hub motor (hobby/interest, not for commercial purposes).

This is so true and a bit counter intuitive. When I was looking at my first board speed and torque on the DIYs scared me because I thought the faster a board goes the more dangerous it is. After riding for several months in an urban environment having extra speed in most situations is a lot safer than not having it.

We're never going to be as fast as cars, but cyclists are sometimes going 20+mph. It sometimes helps to be able to put a little space between you and others when needed. Convenient if you are going to make a turn and need some space. I generally keep it around 20mph for most of my ride, but I do momentarily push for a little more speed when I need it.

I ride often in a road where the speed limit is 25 mph.  It is a perfect road with great smooth fresh tarmac.  There aren't any bike lanes or other paths I can go on, so if I ride on the side at 20 mph cars will get really annoyed behind me because there isn't any room to pass.  The cars usually go around 25-30 mph.  On this road I busted out the black metal scarlet from @longhairedboy and I have no problem keeping up with cars and going with the flow of the traffic.  And to make things more fun, the cars I'm behind or in front of are always snapping photos of me.   So in this instance, my fastest board was my safest.  This is all given that the roads are perfect and I'm familiar with them, and their mostly just straight.  So I can cruise at a constant 30 mph no problem with the cars.  Another example of why higher speed is safer at times.

Now to get this thread on track...I'm still waiting on the Carvon V3s, and I don't have a lot of info about them besides the fact that they will come in 85 kv and 116 kv versions and that you can interchange flywheels easily.  The last update as above is they need to re-order the TKP hanger and also need to fine tune the size of the bolt on axle.  @LEVer was worried about the stator spinning on the bearing tube...i hope he gets that sorted out so there isn't any worry, cuz I really don't want that to happen when I'm going at ridiculous speeds (and that is exactly what I will be doing with this build).  He can take his time... cuz if he's worried about anything, i'd rather just wait until he sorts it out so he isn't worried lol.

i think being familiar with the paths is probably the single most important aspect of being able to ride safely at speed aside from wearing protective gear. 

I've slammed into a few fences due to my ignorance of the path ahead of me.

I weigh almost the same as you.  I ALWAYS get dual even with belts, and with hubs there is much less torque so single wasn't even a question.  If you get the lower kV version you may be happy with a single.  But I personally wouldn't.  I like as much acceleration as possible. 

I would wait for the V3s though.  The v2.5 do (or did?) have a great deal going on them as well and those aren't bad for torque.  Will you be going on hills?  Or do you just want more speed?

I'd go for the V2.5 right now if they're still on sale. It's supposed to end today sometime. It also depends on how soon you want it. The Carvon v3 is not released yet and you could be waiting a few months. These things are individually hand built, so even if you order a v2.5 now, it's not like it's going to be dropped in the mail the same day. 

I recently tried the V2.5 and as long as your not heavy or have a lot of steep grades, it will work just fine. I weigh 135lb, so performance will be about the same for us. Good power and plenty of speed. Unless you are very heavy, go up a lot of steep grades, or love breakneck acceleration, the v2.5 single will work just fine. I don't think the V3 is going to necessarily be a huge increase in performance as much as it allows you to use an unmodified drive wheel.

It's exactly what I'm looking for! I need a small setup to carry it through numberous of trans and busses! Silent will make it only better since it won't disatract people that much.

awwweee yeah! The Carvon's make you feel like you're riding a regular board... Silent Gliding. There's something to be said for not having to hear the whine of a motor when your skating.

Yupp the silence was a strange feeling. Felt like when I jump on my board with the remote off.

But then you just cruise so smoothly. And it keeps going 😂

At some point I will do a steath hub build!

sorry for digging up the thread but is there any update on the V3s?  Seems like the detachable wheel is the leap that makes a hub motor practical.  And frees up room on the deck for more battery :-)

Carvon has stated that they are focused on their v2.5s currently and the EMC-x.  So the V3s kind of are on the back burner for now, that was my impression.  So they will not be out for quite some time.  That's why I've kind of forgotten about them.  I guess I'll look into these next summer if they are out by then even.

I'm strongly considering mellow though.  I know it won't have the performance of the carvons, but I like the fact that I can just mount it to any of my existing decks.

I have a mellow ordered from their kickstarter campaign. Will try and post a review when it arrives.

I have always been concerned about hub motors with recessed rotors.

Metal can shear and I would feel anxious about damaging/warping axels.

Thanks for sharing Mark. 

Everyone help to spread the word, his products speak for itself. I owned a Single v2 and it was such a beautiful feeling, no drag and no sound whatsoever. If you have any question, please contact Jerry through the kickstarter comment section.

He needs to raise 50K to buy new machines to produce the EVO's at his own space and not depending of third party's. I'll probably get EVO 2WD's early bird for 999$! If I had the money I'd go for the 4WD, but that's not happening in any near future.

You won't be able to buy just the single hub motor kit like you can with the v2.5, confirmed on the Kickstarter.

Has there been any recent news on the v3? I'm really looking forward to having the ability to swap wheels as I please, while still having a a hub style motor.

I'm a little new to this stuff. Where do you buy Carvon motor/wheels? The site only sells complete decks (as far as I can tell). I'm looking at 2.5s. I sent them a message but haven't heard back. I'm 185 lbs and have hills all around... Downtown Cincinnati. Should I be considering hub motors?

You wont get v2.5 from Carvon. You can try asking for v3 but i think all v3 speed drives were updated to v4 speed drive.
