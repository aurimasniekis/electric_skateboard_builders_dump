Dude you are so funny. 🤣🤣🤣

To be fair, whatever it is, any prospective wife, gf, bf, etc should not know that it is an obsession until after like 2-3 years of dating/relationship. You may casually mention it as a hobby but avoit to giving a lecture on the specifics of your beloved engineered piece of happiness on wheels.

@Arzamenable 

i think your level of obsession is probably higher than most.

but my gf is pretty chill about it, ever since build #1, that one taking months and pretty much dominating our dining table.

then moving to a tiny apartment, kept building and making a mess everywhere.  granted, i made sure to clean up regularly and keep things tidy.

now we're sharing a 2bd apartment and the "office" is pretty much my esk8 workshop.  i do pay extra for the space though.

through all that, she's been pretty chill and even supportive, i'd say.  she has no interest in joining me or learning to ride a longboard but that may be a blessing in disguise :wink:

😂 I just had a talk with the sister in law. The wife is perfectly happy with my HOBBY. She (in-law) thinks I’m being immature and going through mid life crisis. And spending WAY TOO much because she uses my amazon account and sees my spending on the following. Imagine marrying someone like that and she sees my shelf with three new decks, 6 new motors, CarvOn SDR, mounts, 4 Focboxes, etc. this is all just for future proofing. She saw the cheap stuff and thought this was a problem...BTW she wears all those Pardo, LouisVitun, Goochi, etc 😂 her damn bracelet is $17,000. And I’m the one with a problem 🤦‍♂️

Baby is awake= esk8 stuff is to loud to mess with 
Baby asleep = spend time with us not the skateboard. 

So i wait till all are asleep. Heaven help me if she wakes up in the middle of nigh and i have esk8 everywhere.
Her "so you're not coming to bed anytime soon?"
Me "yeah im almost done"

I'm one lucky dude.  After reading this thread, I feel even more lucky.  Around the springtime this year, I asked her about the idea of me doing my first DIY build.  She only had one condition: that I build her one too.

Great women do exist.  Pic of our first ride together (for proof):

Dude this describes my situation exactly. She calls them "Dork skateboard friends" :heart_eyes:

This thread is really interesting, I was literally thinking about this last night before bed. I read here a lot that people's other halves don't know how much it all costs. I don't actively hide the costs but I also don't wake her up at 5am and say "Sup homegirl, last night I spent £700 on some experimental gear drives for my skateboard lolololololol want some tea?"

Only kidding, I say the last part.

My mom: "Son, you take over half the basement, the garage and the shared apartment upstairs (with my younger brother) with your inventions and ideas. I think as you take up so much space you should pay a bit more than usual."

For me the guilt doesn't come from outright spend. If you can afford what you are buying and don't compromise your lifestyle or the quality of life of yourself or your family then have at it.

The guilt comes from expenditure vs actual use. I have two tiny people living in my house and for better or worse they take up a good 80% of my free time, the other 20 seems to be predominantly cleaning and administration.

My esk8 spend in the last 10ish months is scary high, I've had a couple of production boards I lost money on, loooooooads of spare parts here that didn't fit on builds or I tried and didn't like, a few issues with vendors and people that put everything on hold for months.

For the time I've actually had to get on my board(s) and ride I'm probably nearing £250 per hour of ride time.

I felt the same until I realized that building is where most of the fun for me is. With that mindset I don't really bother about the 250€/ride hour but think about the countless hours of fun I had researching and building etc. In the end all the esk8 stuff you can buy will probably still be cheaper than your neighbor's car stereo upgrade - so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

My wife totally supports my hobby/midlife crises, says its better this than something else. She turns a blind eye to the cost, I haven’t done full disclosure but she knows it’s more than $3k for my first build.

I’m 40 by the way, and back on a skateboard. People at work either think I’m crazy or awesome for doing it. So what though, I enjoy it, my wife supports it, and my kids (5 and 1) can’t keep off it.

I must say, of all the moving hobbies I had (vw corrado widebody custom crap, vw passat syncro g60 complete rebuild, couple of bikes) I like eskating the most! (although I hate the chinese quality bolts and the fact that most stuff is "cheap cheap cheap" while I want quality (heyhey I'm single, I dont give a rats ass about moneyzz) )

On my side I'm lucky to have a supporting wife. She knows how to drive me up my ambitions and also is very forgiving with this hobby. My lady knows where my pasisons lie and won't stop me, instead she helped me many time on focusing to get closer and closer to my goals. 

Find a wife able to make you keep growing, others can't be more than fun & joke !

I still live with my parents. My hole sleeping room is esk8 stuff... I use the garage for working on the boards itself. At this moment I have laying around stuff for building 8 boards :sweat_smile:

I will try to use all those parts and decks in this 2months. My dad is always angry because all those parts are laying arround. 

And then I don’t have talked about my Chinese packages :joy: my postman know my name very good. (Pictures for last week :slight_smile: )

I don't live with anyone other than my room mates so I really just keep all my eskate stuff in my room (running out of space real quick) but the fam has been supportive albeit a bit concerned for my safety. Not surprising since I've hurt myself quite a bit lately.

My parents definitely don't know how much money I've been putting into this, nor have they heard about my close calls with idiot drivers. I intend to keep it that way.

On the other hand my friends call me an uncool nerd who should have spent money on a safer car instead. I don't believe in getting a newer car would be a good decision financially and honestly don't think combustion vehicles should be around much longer considering the amount of damage they have done to our environment and all the fees involved.

My boss isn't a fan, so I no longer ride to work unfortunately.

I imagine as long as I come home with my remaining leg intact nobody will have an issue with it.

Great thread. My missus has no idea how many (extra) holidays she could have been on if it weren't for my hobbies. Thing is, it's all good because I only 'skim' and as a result everything stays neatly under the radar.

Having your own business and a company credit card and PayPal account helps though..... 😂

I live in suburbia right next to a beautiful park/lake. I'm younger than all the other dads around me and no one seems cool enough to even ask to try my board out. Just saw a family that moved here from Cali the other day. Dad rolled by on a well worn longboard. Thinking of bringing him some brownies and making friends :wink:

I’m a lucky bastard. My wife and I have a “don’t ask, don’t tell” spending policy on our personal accounts. I’ve made esk8 a family affair, she rides the LaCriox board and loves it. We ride to restaurants or my daughter’s soccer games nearly every weekend. She does make fun of my esk8 obsession though, especially the group rides.

My wife doesn't mind.
Came home one day after a bad crash. 
Walked into the kitchen. Wanted to hug her, but saw blood dripping on the floor. Told her something was wrong, she looked at my arm and turned white. Big black gaping hole in my elbow. Drove home on adrenaline, didn't feel much pain. 

Went to the ER. 
Hospitalized for 2 weeks. She visited me daily. All good now for some time. She let's me continue boarding, cause she sees how much joy it brings. She bought an e-bike and we go on trips together through the hills. Perfect weekends.

I'll continue as long as my body doesn't give up. She did stop me from buying bigger/faster motors though :stuck_out_tongue:

I went with Joe (SoCalLegend) and Eric (Shredlights) to ride the graffiti tunnel in Vegas. He didn’t warn me there were huge rocks, puddles, and rats at certain parts. Almost ate in when a huge rat ran across my path, most of the tunnel is clear, but it starts off with some large debris @nmagz3 be careful when you decide to go, bring bright lights... Also, I refuse to ride my board through storm drain/gutter water, so I had to pick up my board and jump across the water.  ![image|666x500](upload://4TKy2YCGyba8LosZ4fXpugP2DhU.jpeg)

Anyhow, I'd say that once a quarter we get in a fight about my obsession with esk8.  I've read many of these chat threads above between them and there significant others and they all look so familiar.  

Weather I'm on the forums, facebook, instagram, reddit, or making youtube videos, it's all about esk8 :nerd_face:.  Glad, i'm not all alone on this one.

I feel really bad for anyone here that’s not with somebody who gets it, and worse for anyone with a toxic, controlling partner making “comments” all the time. You deserve better.

Funny you mention this my EX thought anyone over 30 who skateboards was a pedo!!! 

The years with her were the only years I didn't skate since I was 11... Never again :smile:

Thanks man!  I definitely don't take her for granted.

We made it a house rule that we never hop on a board without a helmet.  Even if we are just riding down the street.  I'd like to get her some good gloves with wrist protection.  That would be the next piece of protection that she is missing.

 I would add some kind of rack on the roof for lumber. I prefer that kind of utility vehicle over a pick up, they look nice and are powerful but you can’t carry much in them.

racks for kayaks and paddleboards in the summer and snowboards in the winter!

Maybe a nice generator as well.

My wife would steal it to do Ragnars in though.

If you edit in rapid succession of the original post within 4 to 5 minutes, it won't show an "edited" pencil and save edit history, it will just go in and scrub the old text and replace it.  So *POOF* the original text is *gone*

I'm rather certain it's mostly designed for fixing misspellings and typos.

You could look through the discourse source code and see what it's actually doing if you have a half hour to kill....

My partner doesn't interfere much with my esk8 hobby but she does worries a lot whenever I fell or when I told her that I had a close call with the ground 😅

I feel lucky to have her and we recently rode together (she's in the scooter while I'm on my board) in a car free Sunday route here in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 👍

You can't delete the post. But you can edit the whole thing if you're quick enough. (Adding this in the 3rd edit)

1.) Did it just now.
2.) Again
3.) Fuck...
4.) Does it work still...
5.) Yep
6.) Can't still work... Can it?
7.) Holy shit I had no idea I had this much time to edit!
