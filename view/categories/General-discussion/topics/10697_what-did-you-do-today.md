Much like a lot of other forums, this is a thread for reporting on what you're working on. Doesn't have to be detailed - just a quick update. Post pictures / links / etc to make it visual, or give others reading material.

** if you're doing a build, post a new thread.

I'll kick-off.

Today was Abec 11 wheel research. Contacting skate shops and asking about stock. Then convincing the wife that a group buy from China would be a good idea.

Put some Hawgs onto a set of Holeys to try out on my push pintail. Still need to finish that. Love that pintail.

Same here, though I'm from Australia. I think I've found a guy though who said he can make me any board with any concave and shape, though he said he's not free for a couple of months so we'll see what happens then. 

Not sure how easy it is for you over in America, but I think getting individual plies of wood, and glueing and vacuum sealing might be a cheap-ish option, and rather easy.

Researching lenses for LED headlights.

I had always thought that the bike trails in the area were empty after dark and I could cruise them with reckless abandon, but when I tried that I found out that in fact they are full of teen-agers and my current headlight lenses cast too broad a light pattern to be comfortable to the human eye, so then they were full of annoyed teenagers.

So I'm looking at lenses with a flatter pattern that will cast the light downwards where I need it rather than blinding everyone in front of me.

Connected a 6S Lifepo pack with Headway 38120 cells from work to the Jacob hub motors and did a quick run around the house.

It was my first ride with a VESC ever - happy to say that it feels so much better than the 150A HK ESC I have been using so far. Nunchuck worked great.

The trucks that came with jacob's motors however are squeaking quite a bit - anybody knows what to do against that?

I soldered on all the connectors for everything on my board. Took like 4 hours since I'm a complete noob and have a really shitty soldering iron. Then after everything was finished and I went to plug it in, I accidentally touched a negative lead to a positive and it sparked and totally mucked up the bullet connectors. After that i figured I would just plug it in anyways and see how it went. After configuring the remote and testing it out, one of the motors was going fine, but then the connector that got screwed up earlier started sparking like crazy, blue flashes everywhere and it was loud as Donald Trump's ass flaps...

Figured I'd stop for the night at that point.

in the same boat, alternatively i think you could use this 1m2f splitter and have 1 connect to your vesc and the other veering off to the side of your board to connect to the charger. Don't quote me on this working though, I'm not an experienced electrical guy

your battery blowing up wouldve been his better argument.  or maybe you could add an inveter and convert the dc to ac then a transformer to increase the voltage to something that would break the skin and then you could try to electrocute someone.   hitting someone with trucks is what a caveman would do.  you're smarter than that.

preparing to get wrecked by 100+ mph winds and major flooding. Our house is likely to be ankle deep in water by this time tomorrow...

 Worse hurricane to hit Jacksonville in over 100 years, the entire coast of North Florida has been evacuated, and about half of jacksonville's residents are on mandatory evac. 

7-9 foot storm surge in addition to 25+ foot waves at the beach- biggest storm to hit this area.  _No house on A1A (highway running along the coast) is going to be able to escape the flooding; **not one single house.**_ The waves are going to flow over A1A into the intercoastal, ruining every every property on that thin land strip.

And here in st Augustine is where our beach condo is- the entire city of st Augustine has been evacuated, along with the beaches as stated before. Roads are one way, bridges close tonight at midnight. 

This strip of land (red marker is our first floor condo..) is going to have waves going completely over it, because it cannot withstand a 30+ foot water level increase plus 130mph gusts when it's barely above sea level:

Assuming you aren'the regularly disconnecting/connecting the bullet connectors, why not simply cover the connector with a fairly long piece of heat shrink tubing? The taper beyond the connectors to the wire should allow the tubing to hold the connectors firmly in place.

Ortega over on the westside- 

Riverside area and houses along orgeta on the river are already having waves over the bulkheads into their yards and houses, and we are just about a block inland from all that. 

The problem is that our streets drain into the river, but the river is getting as high as the streets... so they don't drain anymore and start filling up. 

We had two friends that expected to stay evacuate in the middle of the night because the waves were coming up to their back porch and the hurricane was still 8 hours away..

Planning on a special enclouse for a swappable battery with only one bms for more than one battery pack. 18650 cells. (Bms inside enclouse, most bms have a plug for the battery cables so thats my idea ;))
Sometimes i want short range/light board to carry, Sometimes i like to do long rides just for fun or get to friends/work. So i want a short/longrange battery on my favorite board with easy use
But i cant find a good, easy to learn (Best free) 3d print design program that can put .stl or .obj out.... Anyone knows?

This encoulse is also for board with high flex. It will be easy to swap put the batterys without tools. Just a click system. Everything is ready in my head for it!^^ I just want to bring it on the screen and print a prototype with my neightbour 3d printer.

He actually has a rly expensive program rly hard to learn and its only working on his pc because of his license. And i rly dont want to sit by my neightbours house for a week to learn it and than another 2-3 days to design it :D

What do you think about that concept? If someone can share a good program i will post it here and make a thread about it.

For 3d modeling programs, try Blender or sketchup. Blender is able to do so many things, but you may have a hard time with the learning curve. As far as printing, CURA is the best slicer. Sorry I was a little confused as to what kind of program you needed

i feel less vibration with 83mm, but if the your pavement have a lot of big cracks i recommend you to go 90-97mm, look this thread from @ajaynagra (i purchased 90mm from him, but I haven't tried it yet)

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/europe-motor-controller-pulley-wheel-group-buy/10295

if you have the Enertion pulley kit it's easy, just pull off the wheel pulley to the new wheel and change the rest of wheels.

All safe! 

Just a lot of downed trees, broken windows, and flooded beach property. It'll be a lot of work to restore everything, but thus far only one person in Florida has lost their life

Did some meetings. Went further in prototyping in my cargo bike project. Also University saw an oppurtunity in my skateboard project and decided to fund it to measure the impact of a new vehicle implemented in a daily routine.

Pulled the trigger on some 83mm 75A Abec 11's. Going to be a duke out btw the Abecs and the Kegels.

Pays to lurk on eBay....

Totally recommend grabbing one if you're in the EU looking for a switch!

Next up is fitting Holeys with Abecs to a pintail.

Took my board to the BMX track today for the first real test since replacing the pulleys/belts/mounts with new better versions. Super fun, got small amounts of air going over the jumps, enough to learn I need to release the throttle or the wheels quickly spin up when I lose traction! I am on a quest for more air!

Officially started building a board for my daughter. She has been riding for almost 2 years now. She started playing around with tinkercad today and wanted to know if I would help her design her own board...

 It seems like only yesterday we were bombing hills together on gravity alone. :sweat_smile:

Been pulling bits of gravel out of my palm. Took my first fall at speed today.

This merge in the path is where I fell, I didn't realize how much sand and gravel had spilled over onto the asphalt path so when I went over it the board snaked out from under me. I was able to roll a couple of times so I wasn't hurt too bad and miraculously my camera was totally unscathed. 

Wear your helmets and stay safe everyone.

And it's now day 3 of the Abec 11 83mm 75A on my pintail push and the difference on rough road is noticeable.

@lilracerboi Damn I'm late. You probably searched it up by now, but the boots principal goes something like this... A 10 dollar boot, though cheaper than a 50 dollar boot may last only a year and a half, 2 at most. The 50 dollar boot, however will last 10 years, give or take.  So with one is 'cheaper'?
