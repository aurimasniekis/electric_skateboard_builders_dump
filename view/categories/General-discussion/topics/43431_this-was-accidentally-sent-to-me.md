I ordered an item a while ago and it never came so I contacted the seller and he sent a new one. But when I got the package it was not what I ordered. I messaged him again and he resent my original item again and he does not seem to care about the item he accidentally sent me.

It looks like a  cheap BMS I've not clue how many cells it's for. But I don't need it. It's probably useless but is there anything it can be used for. ![IMG_20180105_165324|666x500](upload://skAmylcG2hWBZ0R8gVeV4Fj7oek.jpg)

Might do that. Could also add a converter to 5v and make a portable USB charger. But that feels like a waste. I'll probably save it for future projects where I use rechargeable batteries
