Hey guys so after a long decision I'm deciding to buy a full face whether it be a TSG Pass or Predator DH6 I wanted to add lights to it. I was looking at adhesive solutions but was not able to find anything. **I was wondering if you guys know of any lights to put on the front? (was hoping for some white lights, could even just be flash lights that are mounted but cant find any mounting system, as for the back I was looking at some red blinking adhesive lights)** Also for visibility during the day I was planning on plasti dipping my helmet a neon Yellow, Orange, or Blue still deciding.

Lol. You could buy two led flashlights and Velcro them to the sides of your helmet

I put this right under the visor. It's a "Bushnell TRKR" helmet/headband light and has a clicky adjustable angle. I just took of the strap that came with it and used heave duty double sided tape. It's got a curve to it so it sticks very well. you can do this with any helmet lights. REI has a huge selection, search for "head lamp"
