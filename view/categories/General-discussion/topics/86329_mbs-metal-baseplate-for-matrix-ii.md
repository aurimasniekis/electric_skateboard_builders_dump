Yes but for more than double the price we thought 🙄 or is this the price for a set @MBS ?
If it’s single price than it’s like 10$ less than a full truck. For this price you even don’t get the shock pads 😅🙈

Awesome 👏. Black and white. The deck was $200 full board with new matrix 2 and metal baseplate was $499. Description said a bit shorter wheel base.

If thats the correct price just for the single metal top truck only then, me personally i would go with @Nowind  @Duffman 's version.

@Andy87 They updated the price for the baseplate alone. $35usd. Much more reasonable lol.

I have @ideas mounts already on my mtb build so it'd probably be easier/cheaper to just get the matrix 2 collar from him than a whole new mount setup for the kaly trucks
