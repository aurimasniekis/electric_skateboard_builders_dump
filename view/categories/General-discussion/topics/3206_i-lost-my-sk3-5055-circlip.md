Yes, as the title states, i lost the circlip for my Turnigy SK3 5055 Motor. 

I lost it while i was taking it off it went flying and i have no idea where it is. 

Does anyone have a dead SK3 with a 6mm shaft that i could have the circlip off? 

I live in Australia so it would be better if you live in Aus as well. 

I can pay for it! Help!
