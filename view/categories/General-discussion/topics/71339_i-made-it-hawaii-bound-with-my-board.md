I Made it to Hawaii using my slightly over 160wh battery! I tried getting a battery to travel but customs shipped the battery back to sender. So i just took. Piece of tape Nd wrote 144wh and went through TSA. The lady was scared like it was a bomb or something but after giving her a heads up ( and getting swabbed and shown to several other tsa agents) i was just Sent right through...Aloha bitches!!!

Well done but to be quite honest its not really the most responsible thing to do is it?  Take a potential fire risk onto a domestic flight with members of the public.  Just saying.

The limit is 160wh. My battery is just over 200wh. The battery I ordered was theexact same size but different cells. I dont think i put anyone in danger

damn thats amazing. this means i could print a fancy label saying 99wh on my 148wh pack :joy: if i remove the original nobody would really check would they?

Curious how far you could get away with the 99wh sticker trick. Like roll up with a 12s10p and put the sticker on, see if they let you through :rofl:

I don't condone doing this though, I remember reading on the IATA website that they came up with the guidelines on lithium batteries because the fire extinguishing capabilities on some aircraft can't handle above a certain amount of lithium fire since they are harder to put out than normal fires.

Im gonna get on my soap box for a minute...

When you do this, sneak overpowered batteries through TSA checkpoints your taking a risk.  If something were to happen in flight, during the investigation the TSA agents will be questioned.  You can bet they are going to cover their collective asses and say you claimed it was under 100 WH.  Its a 15 second job to verify that for someone that knows about li-ion cells.  

Were this to happen, your essentially screwing all of us.  I'm not gonna argue that the limitations are a little ridiculous, they are, but that doesn't mean you can bypass them because of convenience.  There are consequences, not just for the user but for all of us.  We are not far away from not being able to carry boards at all because so many people use fake certification stickers and just straight up lie.

I have a really simple personal code..."Don't be a dick, unless it cant be helped".  For all you folks that are sneaking batteries on board, your being a dick.

I have to agree.  If I am on a flight with my family and we get a cargo hold fire due to someone's janky ass Liion pack....  If we survive, the dude who does it will have to worry about more than the TSA.  They will have to worry about me.

My battery is a 10s2p. However 30q is at 215wh while 25r is at 158. 160wh is the limit...  i tried my best to not be a dick but sometimes being a dick is the only way. The battery has been very taken care of and would not have risked it if i felt it wasnt safe. I did however find a box cutter in the overhead compartment.NOT KIDDING!!!  144wh is still totally legal to travel with btw

I'm not saying you specifically, Im saying everyone should strongly consider there actions when it comes to airline travel and batteries.  I promise you, one skateboard battery goes off in the overhead or luggage compartment and none of us get to carry even a skateboard anymore.  

And I mean, @sender is the boogeyman, he WILL come and get your ass...at night...while you sleep...and skate all of your boards and blow up all your VESC's and brake welds on all of your batteries.  I would be very afraid :slight_smile:.

You know considering battery builders are limited in Hawaii you could probably sell that thing at a slight profit now that you got it there.

Lol that's true 

But yeah unfortunately what @mmaner said is inevitable people are stupid and there will always be that one dumb ass that sneaks a janky battery on board and one day one of them will go off it's a matter of time.

Maybe one day we will have small high capacity batteries that are so safe we can fly with them but for now we're stuck on the ground.

Shouldn't be a issue getting individual cells ordered to the island.

Kaly ships his boards there without issues...
The rule is easy but stupid, if the battery is inside a computer, board etc. it can be shipped.
If you want to sent a spare pack it’s not allowed

I actually no a guy that lives in Peru that did just that.  He lives there 2 weeks and home 2 weeks.  Orders all of his supplies to home and then ships them via ground transport and makes electrical crap for people, makes a fortune.

I get that, in theory the battery is much safer in what ever device enclosure it's in than just a plain battery on it's own.

I wouldn’t say so. There are rules how to pack batteries if you ship them with ground service.
If you pack them like this they the same safe as inside of something which is just covert by some paper...
Just how a laptop batter inside a laptop is more safe packed than a spare one?

Well it's much harder to penetrate the battery if it's inside of a box inside of a laptop, much much easier to go through a carboard box and some foam packing.

Just want to point out that the battery size limit was not decided arbitrarily, but for a **Very important reason**

In low atmosphere, standard LIPO batteries expand slightly during the first hour of a flight,  after that they deflate after acclimatising to the lower pressure - This on its own is fine, especially for Lion packs as they dont expand due to the hard casing.

The real problem happens if a problem causes thermal runaway,  due to the lower pressure the packs turn into a small, high temperature explosive.  It lasts long enough to cause thermal damage to the structure of the air frame, and with enough pressure, it can quite easily cause a micro fracture.  If the air-frame isnt 100% / brand new (which they definitely are not) it can breach causing all sorts of dangers.   
Mix this in with normally the batteries are in a semi solid casing, which are normally water proof, this can also make the explosive effect even worse.

well there is my two pence 
(also I dont actually know that much about battery tech, but I am pretty decent with explosive compounds .. that and I work(ed) on a RAF base, and that's their excuse for why we aren't allowed to bring large batteries on board AWACS)

Naw, he doesn't make skateboard batteries.  I mean I guess he could, but mostly works on industrial repairs and e-bike projects.

And guys If you have an Alextech battery don't just leave it when your going on planes leave it when your going in public.

Your not wrong.... i guess im just admitting to being a bit more of a responsible dixk lol. I have a bigger battery and tried my best to follow the rules, i just couldn’t go a week without skating 😏. I would never risk bringing my 12 s or eveb 10s5p with double the size.... I remember bigboytoys (RIP) mentioning the sticker trick working on his 12s5p so i dont think they have had to go hard on yet since the only incidents have been hoverboards and samsung phones
