Title is basically it, I was out in Venice Beach shooting with my new Osmo gimbal  just enjoying the evening right after sunset. I pull off the bike path for a bit here https://www.google.com/maps/@33.9979674,-118.4833023,3a,75y,172.38h,102t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTWQea0oqQg1Xruc_t2A-oA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 

Im watching some of the footage when this big dude rolls up to me on a metro bike and starts yelling "look at you pussy ass bitch nigga" and starts saying he's gonna beat me up, which honestly he probably would have if I didnt have my helmet from the recent @JLabs group buy. This guy just starts throwing punches at my face! I put the visor down and was like, dude knock it off, which incited him to actually get off his bike and start coming at me for real. I stay facing him and pick up my board and remote while he's punching my helmet and for a split second considered using my board as a self defense weapon (outward-mounted machined aluminum motor mount)  https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/7/c71b876e0ddec9f964113e4cd9c7622b0fd2a56c.jpg

but thankfully I was able to actually distance my enough to set my board down on and get a grip on my remote.

I start heading up Barnard Way, which is a pretty long smooth street that I take every day to get to work. 
https://www.google.com/maps/@33.998305,-118.4833581,3a,75y,346.14h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjGG1WWUDdX4WYoszKQ8z-A!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DjGG1WWUDdX4WYoszKQ8z-A%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D53.915966%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192


This dude gets back on his bike and ends up following me! I start cautiously gunning up my speed, I dont normally go more than 15mph but this guy was freakin nuts and was seriously trying to catch me and started saying he's gonna kill me. . I lose him for a bit, then get back on the bike path to get back home and he finds me AGAIN and keeps aggressively shouting that he's gonna kill me. At this point I floor it and (shout out to Ronin trucks) was able to make a sharp turn down a sidewalk that threw him off for a second, here: https://www.google.com/maps/@33.9963286,-118.4820962,3a,75y,52.72h,97.74t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s_sRjuhigmDWm2W3wkDwVHg!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3D_sRjuhigmDWm2W3wkDwVHg%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D38.327805%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656

then I turn around and head back up the bike path to Barnard and turned off of a sidewalk that connects with Main Street. https://www.google.com/maps/@33.998305,-118.4833581,3a,75y,73.83h,89.21t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjGG1WWUDdX4WYoszKQ8z-A!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DjGG1WWUDdX4WYoszKQ8z-A%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D285.03802%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192

Main street is not a good street for going fast because of all of the cracks and potholes to I figured that if he could still see me and follow me, I should start going up this big hill https://www.google.com/maps/@33.9995035,-118.4811371,3a,75y,68.55h,104.51t/data=!3m9!1e1!3m7!1sxU8RLL7oXTni2M1z7rQwQA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!9m2!1b1!2i44

 because there's no way he could keep up with me on these hills and it would give me time to breath and think of the fastest/safest way to get home on a Saturday night through Venice, which has some GARBAGE roads for e-boarding. I eventually make it to whats actually one of my favorite restaurants, Cafe Gratitude
https://www.google.com/maps/@33.9982331,-118.4737677,3a,75y,161.19h,95.13t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sNUzt5OepuwitbN6bCRhu0g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192

, and just hung out there for about an hour while I cooled off and waited for my legs to stop shaking. After I was able to think straight again I headed back home and now here I am. Really freaky night, I feel like I definitely owe my safety and well-being to all things e-board related in that moment. 

I attribute every aspect of my safety in that situation to my e-board and also to @JLabs for the generosity with the group buy that finally pushed me to buy a full face helmet and use it for EVERY RIDE. Shout out to @chaka for the invincible VESC that flew my uphill to safety, plus his insane drivetrain for not coming lose like my others routinely do and for handling the wild acceleration I was pulling, AND for the Ronin trucks for not being a wobbly mess at speed and allowing me to confidently maneuver while going ~20mph on some narrow paths.

Just a few weeks ago I didnt have full face protection, my motor mount would NEVER stay in place and was COMPLETELY unreliable, plus going even a little over 15mph on my cheap trucks was horrifying because of speed wobbles. Situation would've ended differently had I not recently made the investment in high quality reliable parts.

Im still a bit shook, not sure how to end this, but everybody please take safety seriously! It doesnt matter how "safe" YOU are, its the OTHER people around you need to worry about!

I remember like maybe 8 years ago there was some longboarder who got assaulted at a skate park by a bunch of skaters there in front of his kids.

He was fully geared up. Helmet, elbow pads, knee pads, and wrist guards, but if I recall correctly he still had to go to the hospital to get stitched up. 

I can think of one other instance where a person was able to get away safely from some goon thanks to having his board and his safety gear, but I don't remember any details.

Stuff like this happening isn't unheard of, but in general I'm definitely a lot more wary of cars than people.

I'd hate to have to try and gun it during such a tense situation, thats the absolute worst mental state for staying on your board, holding your lines, and not getting wobbles.

You had every right to stand up to him and defend yourself! That's why it pays to learn some sort of self defence,I was lucky enough that my dad took me to karate at an early age and became a black belt by 14.
I get not every one wants to fight or can but that's the world we live in these days some people just want conflict,glad you were able to get away safely though and had no inflicted injurys that you obviously didnt deserve!
Isn't venice beach renowned for people like this off there heads on drugs?

This is probably not good advice, but this situation is part of why I carry a sharp knife at all times and ESPECIALLY when out riding. Not that I would necessarily pull it in a conflict, but because I'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. But I would cut a bitch

I agree, im gonna look into knife handling/self defense classes because honestly knowing how i get in those situations. if i had pulled a knife it that situation it might as well have been his! 

Ive commuted through this part of Venice for 3 years and havent witnessed ANY violence, but there are for sure a community of druggies but they usually stick to themselves. This guy seemed like he was actually wealthier and just on something like coke or whatever makes some people irrationally angry. He looked very well put together and taken care of besides his insanity.  Other parts of Venice are some of my favorite places to be though! Rose Ave and Abbot Kinney are almost daily hangouts for me, first friday was last night with a ton of food trucks and it was a good time!

Since you mentioned gimbal I thought you were shooting with something expensive...but yeah, I guess you can't even buy a gram of coke for that (didn't say that, would not even know what it costs).

that story about the longboarder is so heartbreaking...just a dad trying to have a fun time with his kids..

Im not sure about carrying weaponry yet, only because without training, it might as well be the other guys. i also think if i wasnt standing still for so long, the situation wouldve never happened. such a wild night, it was definitely a sobering realization of how much eboarding has changed my relationship with the city. I just get where I gotta go, Im never not moving and having encounters with anybody really except for the people at my destinations

Basics of self defense are a must!
Also consider getting a military grade pepper spray so if he decides to call the cops or anything you didnt hurt him
Or you can spray him and then break his ribs lol

Glad to see you made it out in one piece, physically. Did you at least report what happened to the police?

I would recommend self-defense classes for sure...one of the unfortunate consequences of living in California is really strict weapon laws for non-law enforcement peeps, like most of us here.

But basics are, aim for breaking the nose, the collarbone, or dislocating the knee caps. The third is probably the very last thing, since it takes more force than the first two.

I don't carry(firearm) when I ride, but I do carry a legal length sheathed knife in a plastic thigh strap. Mostly for safety in case someone's helmet or backpack needs cut off. 

But in those situations like yours....Arm pits or kidneys. If someone ever grabs you. 

Glad you are ok. Also as @Acido said, get a gel pepper spray with colored coating. So it marks the Person and call law enforcement. They'll find the. With dyed skin lol

Lol let me refrase it

In the USyou can carry any knife, provided it is not concealed (ie open carry)

If it is concealed, it cannot be a spring action, or gravity action. Cannot be over 5" blade(4" in some states)

So yes you can walk down the street with a sword in your back. But not under your jacket. And the sheathing could only cover 3" of the blade by the hilt.

There's alot of dumb laws. But anyway, a hard handled 5" combat knife or buck knife is concealable by law(at least in NC and MD)

@Acido In California you can carry anything fixed (knifes, swords, machetes, etc.) as long as it's visible from three directions. Can't carry anything spring actuated (spring assisted is fine, no gravity knives (butterfly knife) and no double sided knives. Concealed, I think it's 3.5 or 4 inch blade max. California has some suprisingly loose knife laws

Edit: @Deckoz just read further and saw you explained that :joy:

I'm going to start skating there instead of driving next month, and your story is what I keep hoping won't happen to me. I hope not to run into that guy. The pepper spray thing sounds like a good idea. I'll make sure to add a good pepper spray to my list. That guy was probably a combination of being on meth while having a mental illness, something that is common in Venice.

That's why I mentioned learning self defence,you can quite easily take someone down or incapacitate them if you know how!
Pepper spray is a good idea if you find yourself in this situation and don't want to use violence or don't know how.

Sorry to hear this story. Becoming the target of senseless and unexpected violence while doing something you love can steal some of the joy. I hope you’re able to fight against that and continue to enjoy your rides at the beach. 

For the record, I think you handled it as well as possible. Even for someone trained, disabling an unknown attacker requires a lot of risk, you made the smart choice by extracting yourself from the situation. 

I know a lot of guys advocate carrying a knife or gun, but I know the area you ride (I live in Redondo) and I think carrying either would be asking for more trouble then it’s worth. If you want to carry something, I’d recommend pepper-spray, you’ll be much more comfortable deploying something nonlethal and it will be a sufficient deterrent for 99% of people, as plus it works on most dogs too.

Am I the only one here thinking that carrying a gun seems a little bit too much ? 

Pepper spray is just fine imo...

Or Canada heh ? :stuck_out_tongue:

Venice Beach is a mecca for skateboarding, Dogtown Z-boys etc.  Maybe he's one of those old school purist dudes that see ESK8 as an abomination and decided to take that anger on you.  Be careful lots of skaters hold that resentment against longboarders.  I would get insults thrown at me when i ride by the skate park by my house.

There are some dogs that don't care about pepper spray? WTF. If true that is scary.

Glad you weren't injured.  Although, as some have mentioned I ride with my knife now. I can handle my own, so I am not worried about one on one human interaction.  I am worried about dogs.

 It is damn dogs that I have had issues with for the past month.  On 3 separate occasions in 3 different neighborhoods somebodies damn dog gets out of their house/garage, etc. and comes running after me.  Almost got bit once when I was slowing down at a 4 way stop and this damn demon dog came out of nowhere.  I turn around as I am going across the intersection and literally see Cujo about a foot away from my leg with his mouth turned and open.  I was going probably 10mph at the time, and jumped off the board yelled. Thank goodness the dog stopped immediately once I yelled What the F*ck!"  Then I screamed who's f*cking dog is this as, no joke, another dog runs out from the same yard towards me.  The owner comes running out screaming their names and it was like none of this shit happened.  They both turned and headed towards the house.  

As this was in suburbia, it drew a little audience at the 4 way stop. The lady which seem rather embarrassed, apologized and I wasn't really hearing that as she almost lost a dog.  Both dogs were a german shepard mix... That was the first of the dog incidents, but ever since then I have been carrying my knife with me.

For dogs a taser works better than a knife, 99% of the time they get scared by the sound alone. And if they actually bite you then tasing it to let go would work better then stabbing the animal... lol

Pepper spraying some people on some drugs simply makes them even more irrational and enraged than they already were.
In some jurisdictions, just carrying pepper spray is a felony.

Maybe I should design a skate friendly hoster with a skid shield.
[/quote]

That's actually a good idea. Might not even need to design an entire holster...just a semi-rigid shield that reliably connects to an existing holster. Perhaps out of Kydex or similar. Quite a few DIY holster vids on YouTube that use Kydex...at least until YouTube puts its anti-gun "everything" policy into effect that will ban any gun-related videos including DIY accessories, demos, testing, safety vids, etc.

If you're in a place where a esk8 is considered a motorized vehicle, then police could cite you for the camera attached to a helmet even in places where a helmet isn't required by law for riding. Federal (I think) law prohibits certain helmet modifications. It's a Department of Transportation safety compliance thing. There are additional restrictions on how far off the surface of the helmet anything can extend. That may be a state issue. For example wearing something that extends more than 1/2 inch (value may vary) is illegal in some places and can get you fined.

If you're talking about a point-contact Taser, then the "spark" would probably disrupt all communications between your remote and the board's receiver(s). It would instantly stop some boards. You wouldn't want to use it while moving.

most of these electronics have a decent shielding and shouldnt be phased by a small taser. If it was a big emp then u would have to worry, or if u touch the board circuit with the sparks, then yea u have an issue

I think some testing wouild be needed to determine for sure. I know I've had two battery operated devices (phone and bluetooth speaker, both with internal antenna) lose pairing due to a static electricity discharge in the same room. Those were older bluetooth devices, hardware and firmware, however...about 2 years ago. It's possible bluetooth upgrades have made comm a bit more robust. A Taser would also have a much longer duration and more time to disrupt the signals. Electric spark-gap devices are also used to produce broad-spectrum RF jamming.

spark gaps are used, yes, but usually in conjunction with large coils to produce a LARGE EMP. i will build a taser if i have the Caps to do so laying around and test

Unless you unknowingly cut him off at some point or slighted him in some way again unbeknown to yourself, it sounds like a mugging tactic, criminals often mix in confusion in order to get what they are after - your coool esk8

if you are confused then you are less likely to escape, that is part of the plan. He chose you as he wanted the board and felt he could physically take it off you.Getting out of there was the correct option.

Of course the keyboad ninja would say get a few meters away and use the control to the launch the board at him full throttle, then return the board after he's knocked down(reverse FTW)..but you did the right thing bro, weapons are not an option in CA afaik, meh on the pepper spray/taser too much scope for misdelivery and extra beating.

You don't get people doing this kind of thing in Texas for good reason.

Not true bro... this happened in Galveston, tx because 4 guys thought I was gay... 2 of them met the business end of my bowie knife, lost the blade for a year to the local police for stabbing them but got it back... shit like this happens a lot in Texas... I was hit with a bat btw and my mandible was broken on the left socket and just to the left of the middle of my mouth

Were you on your board when this assault took place? I hope you caught the those two good with the blade. I learned 20 years ago that no matter how much of a badass I thought I was, it’s a terrible idea to fight more than two guys at once.

Gotta agree. SoCal is in general a great place to be in on an esk8. A pic from how I ended the day today. Sitting to the left (out of pic) was a big burly tatted up dude and his slightly less scary friend...looked like trouble, but they were the nicest guys in the world. chatted with them for 15-20 minutes about getting out and enjoying the sunsets. Life is always gonna be better with an esk8.
