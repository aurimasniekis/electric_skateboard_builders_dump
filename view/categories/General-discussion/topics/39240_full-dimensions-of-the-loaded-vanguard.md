I'm making a vanguard clone and I'm wondering if someone could send me the dimensions of the flex 2, I understand they give you the length and biggest width on the website but ideally I need the smallest width and biggest width of the deck

[Here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/673d2vquttt74dd/loaded-vanguard-longboard-deck-flex-1-blem-2_1.1469113787.pdf) from @lox897 you have a real size print of the vanguard. Just open in adobe reader and print as poster. it's not 100% accurate but it doesn't really matter for DIY ehehe
