2 awesome boards I think it would be fair to compare them but which would you choose and why ?

Kaly 2.0 or Lacroix ?

Kaly, because can I say the name without feeling like I'm being pretentious. And it looks cooler. And no belts. My superficial reasons are superficial.

I'd type my answer but it'd sound too much like yours. I'll make this a poll for fun

[poll type=regular results=on_vote public=true]
* Kaly 2.0 Deck
* Lacroix Deck
[/poll]

That poll surprises me. From what I‚Äôve read the Lacroix deck seemed more comfortable and generally is a better carver

Nobody can really know given that the Kaly XL deck is just now shipping.

I've got both, I'll be sure to report back my experience and feedback once I get a thousand miles or so on the Kaly deck.

The Kaly deck feels really locked in. I'm comfortable riding it without bindings. I had a trampa deck before -- I needed the bindings to feel secure and to take harder turns.

The little flaps really helps lock the foot in.  Significantly more comfortable than vanilla trampa.  Don't see how you can put bindings on these though... no bunny hops 
Shameless plug of first impression on test ride.. oh wait you read this already.. hence shameless :D :

I see a lot of positive feedback on the little flaps.    Or personally I call them ‚ÄúBatman wings‚Äù ü§£That‚Äôs good!!   Personally I think the scariest part about a kaly is hitting over 33mph and keep it composed.   Let‚Äôs hope that‚Äôs no longer the case ha

This just comes with rider experience and a properly tuned in setup.

Plenty of people can do 35+ without issue. I do so daily. Your personal experience doesn't reflect everyone else's.

We talking about channel trucks and high speed stability again?
Hold on let me grab some popcorn!
![image|267x200](upload://gxGUDIiml2RDcmRN8gy6NlYtAu9.png) 

Joking aside I am one of those whacko that @DerelictRobot refers to :).  I run channel trucks at highish speed.  I won't use them as race setup but 35mph is very doable without stability issue.  And yes I actually did post log of GPS and Vesc matching doing 38 on the other thread

Yes.  I can agree with the fact that 38mph on those trucks can be achievable.  BUT they would have to be either super tight or be running some dampas on them.   With that being said that will take a toll on turning and carving abilities at low speed witch of course is ok as long as you‚Äôre into high speeds rather than carving and making sharp turns   Hey.  That‚Äôs just my opinion.  That‚Äôs all ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That‚Äôs what you call sarcasm in case you didn‚Äôt know.    Yes.  I‚Äôm fairly new at this hobby but I also have enough experience riding different boards from a damn halo board all the way to top of the line kaly, Lacroix and diy shit.   whether you like my opinion or not I don‚Äôt care.   One thing I can tell you And again this is just my opinion.   THOSE TRUCKS ARE UNSTABLE 

Now take it or leave it.   I don‚Äôt care.   Peace ‚úåüèº

BTW I actually don't agree those trucks are unstable :stuck_out_tongue: BUT I do find this discussion very amusing.

I ride with very loose springs and dampa in the back.
Got around the hard to turn issue by using bindings.
They are mountainboard trucks.  If you ride them like skate trucks you are going to have issues :slight_smile:

Haha.  Maybe I need to learn some riding skills from you brother.   I don‚Äôt mean trucks are overall unstable.  More like for high speeds and stuff 35+.  But I guess they weren‚Äôt meant for everyone. Idk ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   Back to the topic 
New kaly looks great maybe some day I‚Äôll be lucky enough to test ride one üëçüèº

I don't have a Jaws. 

I have a custom LaCroix build using the prototipo deck + a straight cut Kaly gear drive. I don't really do belts on Carvers.

Forgot which thread this was. 

I can say that I'm about 5k miles into my Kaly build and I absolutely love the XL deck. It's likely my favorite MTB style deck so far. The wings give you the ability to lock in quite well, I went firm stiffness and prefer the stability in riding higher speeds over my OG LaCroix deck build.

I have gt carbon evolve but the Lacroix is heaven on wheels compared to this.
But what do you do if you live in the city and have to face tight corners ,uber ,and a piece of mind?
