Alright, so I am conflicted on what to buy.  I have come to this forum for answers.  

I weigh 185ish pounds and am 6'2.  I live in an area of moderate hills with a few hills that are pretty steep.  I would like to go at least 25 mph.  Something very important to me is definitely battery life but I would like to keep the price of battery under $150. 

So I would like to keep the entire build under $500 if possible.  I would like dual motors but price may be too high.
 
So what would you guys recommend me buying? 
Should I use 149 KV or 190?

i weigh 220lbs and i can get away with a 213 kv setup on 10s. old ratio was 18/40 but it wasnt the best with hills so im dropping to a 14/40 ratio.

that board is for sale if youre interested. close to your price point.
