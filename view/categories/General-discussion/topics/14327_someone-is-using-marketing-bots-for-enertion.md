If anyone frequents the electric skateboarding subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/), **Somone** has a bot/spammer commenting on the excellence of the Raptor 2 which I think is really funny/ironic.

You can see the account here: https://www.reddit.com/user/ridergurl

Makes me appreciate this forum more - thanks mods!

Edit ** thought it was @onloop's bot, edited since apparently it's not him.

We don't know if @onloop himself is doing this. It could be anyone. Don't make accusations without evidence.

I don't think he is doing it himself. But he has some very low skill employees (probably same people who answer customer support) who do this kind of stuff. Not only on reddit, but recently on endless-sphere too.

Ok. Yes I'm assuming it's @onloop but it's difficult for me to think someone else is running a counter campaign against Jason like this. If so, it would be some impressive inception level guerilla marketing. I'll be the first to admit I'm an asshole for making this assumption if that turns out to be the case :) .  

This is more meant to be a fun post and I don't think it's wrong for him to try different ways of marketing -- maybe I just have a messed up sense of humor. I work in a small company and at a small company you've gotta do everything you can to get the word out: spray and pray. I really admire Jason's hustle, you've gotta keep trying and sometimes a marketing channel works, sometimes it doesn't and worst case scenario is that it backfires. 

Personally, if I were onloop I'd do everything in my power get rid of this account since it's damaging due to how obvious it is. Either I'd stop using the marketer (assuming it's him) or have the mods address the account (assuming it's not him).

Yeah you are. This is very insulting.

I do all my own marketing. I make all my own videos. I do all the graphic design for my business. I desing all my own product. I work my arse off to try to build up my brand and make the best possible products. Just 12months ago I was packing all the orders and doing all the emails too & only just recently started paying myself a wage. 

Why the fuck would I need a bot to make random comments on reddit?

I really thought you were one of the more intelligent people on here? I just lost a huge amount of respect. 

Please refrain from starting threads like this. Its completely off topic and has nothing to do with esk8 builders.

Alright - I'm an asshole for assuming! At my work we firefight fake posts all the time, half the battle is finding them and then following up to protect or reputation. Like I said, I'm not doing this to disrespect you, I know you hustle your ass off on marketing but I was just assuming you were trying something different which I'm not knocking - you should be trying many different ways of getting market traction and you're only one man. We've used marketing companies that go in really odd directions and we've come to regret it. Other times it works, it's hard to know how these things will pan out. I was taking this more as something I thought was funny, but I think you are taking it as not  -- from my background this stuff is really benign. 

That being said, some weirdo out there is promoting Enertion in a damaging way on reddit and according to @rmrf, on endless sphere too... so, like I mentioned, if that's the case you should probably address it.

I agree that there are a lot of happy enertion customers. I don't think this person is one of them. I honestly think this is a weird direction to take the discussion since the account seems very obviously like a spammer account but I'll indulge you in your argument.

The reason I think this account is a spammer/bot is because there are lot of spammers/bots on that subreddit, particularly from Marbel Boards, and this account looks and behaves in a very similar way. The account is 20 days old, never replies to anything in context, and **only spams pro raptor 2 comments**. Other users on that subreddit have also pointed out this account as a spam account as they have pointed out many other spam accounts. 

Let's compare this to a different account, someone who I think is a genuine fan of Enertion. 

https://www.reddit.com/user/armanditooo227

This guy has been trying to get himself a raptor 2 through your referral program. His account is diverse and varied and he actually looks like he's replying to threads in context. He says other things other than pro raptor 2 comments. I think he's a real person that is bugging people on that subreddit to use his referral link. 

This is the internet so I have to take contextual clues to make these decisions. I think ridergurl is a spammer just like I won't click an online ad that says my computer has been infected by a virus. Do I know 100% for sure that the advertisement isn't trying to save my computer? Do I know 100% ridergurl isn't real? No, but given the context, knowledge, and general experience online I can infer that both are fakes. 

Also, I can't believe you once thought I was intelligent. That one is on you :slight_smile:. I'm trying to keep this light but I don't think it's working. I still think you're great and find it unfortunate that you've lost respect for me.

Sorry guys. I know I'm new and all. But I've been following for quite a while now. Why does anyone give two fucks what @onloop does with his company? Seems like there's some kind of jealousy or something going on here. If it's about his claims about having the most powerful board to date, who really gives a f$ck? You know, it's kinda like when you tell you some chick you have a 12 inch dick when in reality it's 8. It's advertising. Marketing is a whole other world guys. Especially in the small business market. It's what you have to do! If it works, great! If it doesn't... no harm no foul other than to the person actually taking the time to market because he/she will lose money spending the time. Why don't we all wait until the product is released until we come to these speculations? Give the man the benefit of doubt at this point. He's been really honest in saying that the Raptor 2 is still in testing. When you purchase now it even gives a schedule! I'm not trying to start any wars or anything guys. Just trying to state that this board hasn't even released nor is it in production yet. Let's be patient. Then we'll see the results. 

@onloop Keep doing your thing dude!

@racidon How is it false advertising when the product isn't even a reality yet. It's in production. Who's to say it's not what @onloop is advertising? We don't know yet as it's still being worked on. The assumptions should probably stop at this point as it's all speculation.

I'm not talking about the Raptor 2 bud, I'm talking about you saying to someone you have 12" when in fact you have 8"
That equivalent is false advertising.

It would be the same as a car manufacturer saying the car has a 6 gears when it only has 5.  Or a game developer talks about how a game will have multiplayer when in fact it never does (some will understand the reference).

To some degree, yes, it's speculation, but math is math and science is science. From what we know for example, his battery is a 10s4p from 18650 samsung 25r cells. These cells are rated to 20a continuous, but even Samsung says these cells will have less than 1/3 of the life cycle if you pull 20 amps continuous from them. Unless he changes batteries (which is not likely), we can already see where this is going... People in 6 months will complain about the sag, and shorter battery life than the raptor 1.

The hub motors torque is not known, so I don't say anything about it. He gets the benefit of the doubt. But they are what, 70/75 kv at 10s with 90mm wheels? 24 mph on flats max, no way they are hitting 28 mph, unless your 100 pounds. 200 pound guys like me get 28 mph at 12s on 90mm with 90 kv motors, 10s with 70 kv motors will get 24 mph maybe, probably less.

We can use science and math to determine things that already known about the board and make conclusions. Range, very questionable too. But we do need to see the motor before we can say for sure.

Almost every number about this board seems inflated, based on what we do know. The numbers that we can't say are inflated are because we haven't seen the actual motor yet.

I don't have any good reason to hate this board. I just just hate people who pour money into boards like this that are promised x, y, and z, and get a fraction of that. Every mainstream manufacturer bullshits their numbers. When will someone rise up and actual break the numbers down by factors, such as weight and rider terrain, so that we can hold board manufacturers accountable to their numbers and consumers actually know what they are getting?

I think theres a lack of repsect overall in the forums, from what I have seen its specifically one person's part. Why are you getting so mad over such a small thing? It is one thing to say, "nope, it was not me, must have been a very excited buyer or a bad marketing agent" or most commonly your path of action which begins with, "fuc# your couch you a##whole". 

There obviously is a better route, I know everyone agrees with this. Like someone else mentioned to keep this forum clean. There are better word choices for voicing anger. 

Nonetheless there is always that one guy/gal that is just blatantly bad at advertising for EVERY product on amazon or any website. 
Somethings in this thread could have been said better and worded better.

To be fair to @onloop , my raptor 1 lived up to or exceeded all the claims for top speed and range, and it really did climb ANY hill I came across.  So his numbers for the first raptor were definitely not inflated.  Raptor 2 is to be determined.  That's more than I could have said for boosted or any other company's board.  Although I'm expecting chaka's build (ollin freeride) to meet the claims it is making easily.  Also didn't he say his hubs are 90 kv?  That makes 28 mph easily achievable with 90mm wheels.

Everyone should hold their judgments until they get the product, simple as that.  That's what I do.  In my experience Enertion isn't perfect, but they did deliver a product that did what it said it does.  It just needed more refinement.

The whole company is basically dependent on this product, if they don't deliver...I don't think Enertion  will last too long.  Onloop should be aware of that, so pretty sure he won't intentionally make false claims about it.  

So everyone hold your shorts...wait until May/June, and if it's a fail product then you can complain about onloop all you want.  And everyone can file paypal disputes etc (which the customer always wins...so it's in onloops interest to have a solid product).

At the end of the day Enertion have to deliver. They delivered on RV1 ablet with some niggling issues, learning curves to build the business. The thing is a awesome and you dont tend to find products like that any more. Sure Boosted owners swear by their BB1. The Raptor V1 was the bomb. If you havent  owned or tried one I dont think you can really say too much against it or the new one yet.

Nothing is perfect, so maybe RV2 might be just that much better.  He He. Here you go use my link.

http://www.enertionboards.com/raptor-2-direct-drive-electric-skateboard/?setCurrencyId=2&afmc=6w

By the way that new up hill video is telling in my opinion of what is to come. 

Also to be fair Enertion do run a good marketing campaign. With no real budget.

Also noticed @evoheyax may have your own agenda here since you keep proding. Hows the 4wd going.?

There is a growing trend of negative comments targeted towards myself and enertion products. 

Nearly every day there is a new thread or comment that is slandering enertion with no valid reason or facts to support it.

These comments are mostly coming from a select few users and their counterparts who gain commercial advantage by propagating negative feedback towards enertion.

This toxic behavior will not be tolerated, it is beginning to impact on the overall positive sentiment that exists in our community of esk8 builders. If this continues I'll have no option other than to ban people who choose to behave in this way.

I created this forum so that we can all grow the industry together, push new developments hard, innovate and discuss the joy of esk8 building. I believed that we would be stronger together, maybe I was wrong.

Unfortunately it seems a small minority of users don't know how to coexist in such an environment and continue to propagate negative energy which is disrespectful to all community members who enjoy spending their free time here reading and learning.

I'll be reviewing the forums rules and enforcing them when necessary.

I am very disappointed to say the least.

At the end of the day best to leave it to your moderators to enforce the rules. Just wont look great if you do it IMO.

Just concentrate on delivery of the product. Thats all I want to see. Not everyone must like you or your product or whatever. Thats life. I also understand your protectiveness of the brand.

People also want to put another point across and try to back their reason. You have to accept that. You may not be right.

Ppl can read through the crap frm whoever it comes from. Intended or not.

I feel the topic is a bit different... there are other topics around the Raptor2 itself, this is more about the behavior of the user behind the name 'ridergurl'.

Hope some of you still remember ~7y back when something similar happened with LG. Fans trashing other phones on forums - Apple, Samsung, HTC, etc. When someone unveiled similar relationships bw those comments, LG posted a message apologizing for those users and messages and asked the LG fans to respect others. LG rejected the claims that they stood behind those forum comments and they also rejected and distanced themselves from those users and behavior.

So instead of picking this up, it would have been enough to act similar way: just write that it's not Enertion who is behind those messages (already written) and reject this kind of behavior and distance himself from those type of comments. Others could think he does not care for such behavior.

R, J.

You're not the pariah here. I gain no commercial advantage from propagating negative feedback on you or Enertion, in fact, I've been a customer and have also recommended your products to friends. I'm also taking you at face value when you say the account is not affiliated with you. As @wmj259 mentioned, it would have been easy for you to say "Hey man, thanks for showing us this user, this isn't Enertion and we're working to investigate these concerns. Our great fans maybe overzealous about our awesome referral program so spam can be an issue." fist bump and we're on our way. Instead it snowballed.

People like and respect you onloop, you have many fans and supporters and we all appreciate what you do. Conversely you have a side of yourself that can be very condescending (like telling evoheyax and hummie to come back when they've learned to build a decent esk8) and divisive in how you react to feedback. If someone I like has food in their teeth I let them know, if I don't like them I don't tell them. But hey, if you want to moderate this forum so you only hear people that sing your praises go ahead, more power to you. I know next time I'm not going to bother.

Sorry im not more politically correct & polite when I am being insulted.... i am just getting tired of the recent batch of enertion conspiracy theories...

it's just concerning that because one person says something positive about enertion it's immediately considered a scam bot......?? 

Anyway... this matter was dealt with nearly a month ago in the forum it occurred on. 

This is my response:
> HI esker8s, please take off the conspiracy hats for one second! Firstly, I wouldn't spam my company its not really my style... I have a clean track record on Reddit, you all can look at it, here: https://www.reddit.com/user/onloop/ |||| Mostly i write comments to help folks... Also, I don't really need to spam... I own a forum that has 5 million viewers. I could spam that forum if i wanted....   Now, take one moment and think about this fact: We are currently running a referral program that rewards people with $100 if someone buys a raptor after clicking their referral links...
It simply looks like a bunch of enthusiastic referees trying to spread their links.

I'll tone down the rhetoric, but the reason I say what I've said is because 

a) I believe it to be 100% true (honestly)
b) Enertion started a smear campaign against hummies motors with that jacob vs hummie motor test, likely because he knew back then hummie was a big competitor for him. He continued this rhetoric in his whole raptor 2 campaign, and especially, just 2 days ago, antagonizing both of us. This has gone both ways, and you (Jason) have already damaged our reputation by smearing our work.

There is a line, and I need to shut my mouth, because I'm not gaining anything from pointing out what I believe to be the flaws of his product, I'm actually losing from it.

So I'm done talking about the raptor 2... I've said what I believe is the case, we will have to wait and see.

I'm going to go back to being productive and do something positive for the community.

@onloop The way you say things is little bit depressing:

This is not very friendly to us, the users of this forum. We don't want to be owned by you, please. It would be nicer if you say "I am the founder of this forum", or "I support this forum".

And you say the same thing in your kickstarter video - makes me feel owned again. Please love us, instead of owning and

I think you missed his point. **He could if he wanted to** that means he won't and never would

Enertion started a smear campaign against hummies motors with that jacob vs hummie motor test
[/quote]

I didn't actually do any smearing of anything, I simply made a video of a real product that was in hand, used a thermometer to record temperatures & a timer to record speeds. That story told itself & was as objective as i could possibly make it. It also showed jacobs urethane slipping too. it was unbiased.

So I'm done talking about the raptor 2.

I am happy for you to talk about the raptor 2, good or bad, but you need to do it when you have product in hand or someone elses data, you (others) need to do some real world tests and can then share your thoughts based on real world facts. 

This is how this forum should be for every product. we should always be critical & scientific, but we must have some evidence to back it up otherwise it sounds like you are just and angry scared competitor with a hidden agenda.

**I don't own the users**, I own the forum, i own the domain, I am responsible for the infrastructure required to operate the forum. The users can leave when they want.

the truth is i could spam if i wanted to **but i don't.** 
I could have my employees coming onto the forum to delete negative comments **but i don't.**
I could ban my competitors from having access **but i don't.**
I could sell this forum to a "business" that could pay me lots of money & convert it into an advertising platform **but i don't.**


This forum is for the community, i value the community & I have never & i will never do anything to deceive the users.

Honestly, the whole reason I ever mention anything was to raise attention to what I thought would be flaws, so that everyone would have a better board.

I don't want to argue about that video, but whether intentional or not, the message people had coming way from that video was that Hummies were far worse than Jacobs, which I don't understand, since a slipping rubber in my mind automatically disqualifies a motor. The real strength of Hummies motors was their top speed, and that part was edited out due to Jacobs slipping. Their was very little discussion about the rubbers of Jacobs slipping, and most of the discussion was about Hummies heat. I don't know if you intended to be biased, but it seemed like their was some sort of bias in the conversation (maybe just subconsciously?) in the video (even in your tone, you seemed excited when their was a lot of heat. I know if I were testing motors and one got too hot, I'd be disappointed, but you sounded excited).

The heat is an issue, and as I stated before, the real solution with his motors are to do 4wd. Most heat issues go away with 4wd, and while not ideal, they cost less than half of the bigger motors, so your only spending a bit more on esc's.

Anyways, it is what it is, I'll spend my time being constructive for now instead of being destructive. I wish you the best in your endeavor.

This is very insulting and rude.
We should not have to thank you for not spamming, or not selling, or freedom of speech, even from competitors.
I thought that you were grateful for all of us, expanding the community, inspiring more builders and riders. But in the recent posts that you have made, it seems like you always want us to be praising this forum. I firmly believe that this forum is great, and that most, if not all, of the moderators are wonderful and do a great job. But, no offense, I feel that in these types of posts that you make you are in a way abusing your power.
