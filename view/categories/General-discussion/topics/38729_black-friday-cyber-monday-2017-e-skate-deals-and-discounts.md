....anddddd... another big AT wheel to add to the collection, boys.... Enertion's **100 mm R-Spec Crossover wheels**.

Note: you buy the 2 piece item (US$ 38 dolah) because it was originally intended for Enertion's Raptor as the front set (100 mm R-SPEC CROSSOVER Wheels), the other 2 piece rear set are just the urethane part (sleve) for the rear Hub motors (100 mm R-SPEC CROSSOVER Outwheels). So if you want the 4 wheels for your build you need to buy two complete sets consisting of 2 wheels each.

The R2 10s4p 30q pack...

Despite the long dimension being 20x18.5mm, The pack appears to have cell holders.

https://youtu.be/TcBkwn8Dyx4?t=237

The pricing puts it at $7.42/cell which seems quite fair.

That's why i prefer every day low prices. My wife thinks i don't charge enough on retail. I think she doesn't charge enough for her position as a Librarian. Retail to me is just a way to spread the love. its the icing, not the cake. The cake is in diversified services. Custom individual builds, custom mods on commercials, custom productions for other brands, and then retail. Retail fills in the gaps for cash flow and is dead easy to do, but its only a fraction of the picture. 

TL;DR, 
the goal is to be involved in My Shit, Your Shit, Their Shit, and Everyone Else's Shit. The four shit-pillers of a successful esk8 business.

That needs to be a book, like [The Art of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War) and [The Book of the Five RIngs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Five_Rings) except written by you about the Esk8 biz.

Sounds perfectly reasonable.

(how the f&#k do you fit 4 motors and 4 vesc's on that!!!)
[/quote]

by extending the wheelbase, changing the shape on the ends and calling it a Witchblade GT. :) I'm not sure the Phat Matson can handle four motors, the box is too close to the front trucks. Its a RWD only design really. 

BTW yours is cut, i just need to sand it and ship it. It will probably go out tonight. I'll include a chrome decal you can put wherever you want.

Not sure if this is exactly esk8 related, however owning a bag that won't explode upon contact with the concrete is a big deal for me.

https://www.goruck.com/
Goruck is having a big Black Friday sale for their GR1/GR2 bags, plus I believe you can still couple that with a student/military discount which gives you an additional 20% off. 

I already own a Goruck, so I'm inclined to say that it really is one of the best American made backpacks you can own. I've definitely taken some pretty fat falls at 15-20 mph... so far only a couple scruffs but the bag is still solid.

Ok...HobbyKing is just having some incredible deals on Graphene lipos (these are very high C rating lipos).. like $130 6S batteries now just like $86.  These have like 900 charge cycles which is almost as good as li-ion.

Those graphenes are great batteries in terms of delivery of power but I would be suspicious of those charge cycle claims, I've never got anywhere near that and unless you keep them at storage voltage when not in use they will degrade a lot quicker.

I agree the 900 cycles maybe marketing. But hey if they even get 1/2 of that they are very long lasting. I was for Jet  Spud 29" build about to build another 12s4p pack... which is about $200+$20 nickel strip + protectors + sleeves + sensor cables at around $220 and a lot of work to make the 18650 pack.  I was debating that $220 + 3 hours of labor vs. (2) 6S Graphene packs @ $260 (not on sale).  Now at $86 x 2 = $172 it works out like a good deal... given the parameters of the build is a very mini board and I have 2" tall enclosure.

This is a good use case for me of when to go lipos great pricing and plug and play.  Not on sale.. it would have been 18650 every time.

I never got close to half, maybe 100 cycles? plus more than one pack lost a cell. that said i wasnt taking the best care of the packs and crashing them regularly into trees and the ground at 70 mph+. also discharging an entire pack in less than 3 mins also probably takes a toll

I got a newbie question - hope you don't mind:
Say I buy two packs to create 6s2p battery, how do I connect between the two packs and what kind of charger should I buy? does it need a special treatment when charging for the first time?

1) https://www.ebay.com/i/222431150128?chn=ps&dispctrl=1 -- you can but this or solder your own it's very very easy to do.

2) when you want to charger them... just disconnect them from the adapter #1 is the easiest method and charge each individually. That's the easiest route if you are a newbie to all of this... like 1000% newbie.  Otherwise you can create a charge port for each battery by splitting each of the red and black wires into its own xt90 connector. Then one xt90 connector you use for the parallel connection and on xt90 you use for the charging.  You will want an anti-spark (either key loop or circuit board).There are many other ways.

That one is ok... but it doesn't come with a DC connector if you will plug it into your wall to charge.

Find one with that comes with a US DC connector plug and preferably an XT90 connector for those Graphene batteries. The one you linked has neither... it has an XT60 connector... you can just cut that off and solder on an XT90 plug.  But better to buy a cheap IMax B6 charger that comes with both if possible. As long as it handles 6S you can make it work... that's the important part.

Make sure you write a note in your cyber Monday order saying

"Ship parts inside Raptor 2 box" 

Also note your R2 order number.

You have to feed this esk8 demon -- no two ways about it -- can't be happy about buying a commercial build... you can't limit yourself to what DIY build you have right now.  Parts take time to arrive.  Waiting makes you buy other shit. It's just a cycle :) Hey it's better than drugs right or gambling or drinking.  It's a productive addiction.

I bought that.... I love and hate Amazon.com -- so my last one... was $19.99 about 7 weeks back. Then they notice it sells good and put it on Prime and raise the price... now its $24.99

I wish Amazon would get into 63mm motors and other stuff like that.  If I finally ever enter this business... I will sell motors on Amazon. That would be like my starting place. It only costs like $30 to be an Amazon vendor and list your product. The Chinese are doing it.

I don't know why the vendors from this forum don't do it. Easy peasy.

Wait, wait... so I don't seem like a cwazy person...

I mean wouldn't that make for a great 2018? An esk8 community that sells its products on Amazon... where we can have this shit delivered to our door next day or same day even if we wanted?

Motor mounts, enclosures, decks, motors, pulleys, 12s4p battery packs, BMS's, FOCBox's, VESCs, etc... everything you could imagine. You could get a build together in a day rather than weeks.  It would be such a wonderful world. 

We just need to get the vendors on here to take a chance and produce a decent quantity of products and go Prime.

It's just a matter of time before Amazon destroys every retailer in sight anyways, why not join them?

Of course I know people do custom work and there is a place for that, too.

Two Focboxes will not meet the limit for free shipping.
Free shipping is based on $260 AUD and a focbox is priced at $128 AUD so $256 AUD for two. $4 AUD short of free shipping.

So if you are only ordering 2 Focbox your total will come to $256 AUD with $38 AUD shipping for a grand total of $294.
If you add the nano-x remote it will give you a total of $292.75 with free shipping.

So is kind when you go to the grocery store over the corner and you ask the arab or korean clerk to change a $5 dollar bill for you, he will tell you "No, is not possible" But if you buy something from the store then you will get the change. You wont get $5 dollars $1 dolar bills but $4 instead...and a popsicle that perhaps you didn't want in the first place. Cleverrrrr tactic Enertion.

Yeah, that's what TorqueBoards did for me on Friday. I forgot a thing, got the shipping discount code and put in the order notes. Done in less than 5min over the chat, good service.

@Battosaii Are you planning to put that on the Raptor? Restricted to the 10s3p battery? I'm thinking about swapping the dual 6355 on mine but not sure if it's worth it on that battery

speed wobbles has hardly only to do with the set up. mayby 10% rest 90% is the rider. And all set ups can be tweaked a ton to your liking.

What was the set up if you donnn'tt mind me asking,.

I just chatted with Eric as well, since my label hasn't been scanned either, but it went out for shipping yesterday, and like normal, the label just hasn't been updated yet. Usually tracking takes 2-3 days to update. I think we will be fine, Eric said they take 7-15 days to ship.
