Hi, I have Backfire dual hub esc and it was working really good for around a year.
Last week I wanted to put everything on my Loaded Vanguard deck. I build new enclosures, drilled the holes, built a new battery, went out and the esc just didn't turn on.
I've thought that I didn't connect the on/off switch or something so I went inside to check and everything was ok. The battery voltage is also ok.
Does someone have the same problem and is there a guide to fix it? I checked the pcb board, top and bottom and nothing looks burnt or suspicious

What battery did you built? Is it a 10s battery too? AFAIK the Hobbywing ESC only takes 10s battery :slight_smile:
