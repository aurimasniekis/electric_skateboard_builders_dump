                                ***   UPDATE   ***
This offer is unfortunatly over. 


                                ***   Shipping to US   ***
Because of the expensive shipping to America from Denmark, some of you have offered to receive all the enclosures to one address and then distribute to every individual afterwards. I think that is a good idea. Would anyone be up for this? Please send me a private message if you are interested.

Hi there! 

As some of you may know, I recently launched a ESK8 shop in Denmark/Europe. 
At the moment we don't have a lot of products in stock, but that will change soon. 
[https://pwrboards.com/](https://pwrboards.com/)

In the meantime, we at PWR BOARDS would like to send out FREE ENCLOSURES to everyone that would like to make a video review about them. The product is completely free, but you will have to pay for shipping...

If you are interested, please comment on this thread, and I will contact you ASAP. 

It's possible to receive either our PWR CASE or PWR BOX. 
For more info and specifications, please take a look at our website.

I will do either.  I'm always building new street board so the PWR case could go on immediately.  I'm currently building a new MBS Comp 95, could use the PWR box on it.  Just let me know the shipping to US and Ill get you PayPal'd.

put some more beef on that flange. Bolts are going to saw right through those holes as the deck flexes and the bolts gently back out from people not using enough thread locker, or not using it at all since they're in there all the time foolin with it.

I totally agree with you. That is why I recommend to only use this enclosure with stiff decks. When the deck does not flex, there is no problem at all. :)
Furthermore, the enclosure comes with screws and washers that helps.

may want to ask my first three customers about that. 

My decks "don't flex" too but my oiginal boxes alll came back with torn bolt holes in the same places. I have since moved to a thicker flange and box  and have eliminated the issue completely.  9 ply riock maple decks with a corregated soft-dome w-cave profile that also incorporates a slight camber as part of the dome. The deck was literally designed from the ground up not to flex. 

of course i'm about to go flangless after i sculpt a new box form and pay a man a mold fee, ut that's beside the point. Flanges are fine. They just need beef. Much like the motor mounts in the other thread. 

So the question is....


## WHERE'S THE BEEF?

I see your point and know that you have A LOT of experience and therefore know what you are talking about. 
I will be honest and say that I have also broken an enclosure or two when testing on some flexy decks. 
From my experience with stiff decks there hasn't been any problem though. 

In the future, I could offer another version with a thicker flange for flexy decks.. For now though, I only offer the enclosure for stiff decks..

As you, I would like to have a good business with a great reputation that people trusts and relates to. Therefore I will do anything in my power to keep my costumers satisfied.
As a small business, I have got time to deal with every single costumer - and if anything breaks, they will of course get a new one. 

I can also promise, that if it turns out that many is experiencing problems with this enclosure, I will send them a new one with a thicker flange when I get them in stock. 
Again; I really want to build up my reputation, so costumer satisfaction is my number one priority :)

stick to that. You'll go far. That's how i have survived. IF it breaks, fix it. If they get mad, calm them down. Always be there, always manage expectations by being up front with your own limitations, and always be kind and supportive and present. 

unless they're a fucking prick then post about them on reddit.

Sounds promising and like you have a good plan not knocking it but the most important thing is the product itself,something you can back up! 
No offence..but the first person to recieve one of these enclosure's simply do a stress test,it doesn't get more honest than that.

iteration is critical. listen to feedback and always respond positively. 

people are dead eyed predators when something isn't right. They like to poke and prod and just chew it up. You have to make it seem as if the poking and tearing apart of your baby is a good thing and will only make the baby stronger, because it will. It's hard though. Watching them tear it apart after all that work. It fills you with rage. Use that rage to make your product stronger and faster because fuck them they'll never break it this time. Then they will. And you'll smile and take it and use it and grow that product into the fierce kaiju that will slay the competition seemingly out of nowhere. And everyone will have come with you on your journey and everyone will be on your side and think you're awesome. 

Or you could just be another dude with a box whatever.

I'd be interested in either or both - I'm in NYC and would be happy to pay shipping. 

Is the box waterproof by chance?

Currently building a board... thread is here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/nyc-cruiser-500-build-freeride-blank-sk3-6374-hk-mount-10s6p-ebay-batts-vesc/37094

I'm planning on adding to the thread as the build progresses with full wiring diagrams etc. so I'd be happy to implement the case and show how the various components tuck into it. 

On the box side I travel a good bit (just got back from Colombia, planning a Nicaragua trip next and probably PR also once the island is getting back in line) and carry camera equipment, gopro, laptop etc. so I'd be happy to review that too.

I wish somebody whould make thinner long enclosures. Having a 50cm long enclosure that has a 4+ cm height  is just too much when you don’t stack cells or a fat BMS on top of the pack.

When you have a small BMS for charging only or you have a shorter 3p pack and BMS next to it, having 4cm or more height is just not needed. It just means  less clearance under the deck.
