I have been threatening to build an electric longboard for some time now and I suddently thought, are they actually legal to ride on the roads in the UK?

probably not, like nearly anywhere else :yum:
but the police is usually really tolerant

If it doesn't seem too obvious and you hide the remote behind your back when you see the cops, it's legal for sure :joy:

I think you should not step your foot on the motorway that is meant for 45-60mph and you should be good .. generally I see no reason why anyone would have to ''punish someone'' for using a device on sidewalks / bicycle path'es (unless they are right next / on the same level as the road for cars)..if the speed and driving(riding) is not dangerous to others..

Though I can agree that im extra cautions around the cops.. usually slow down and ''imitate'' that im pushing so I would not rise extra attention.. non the less, I've heard some good things about police and these devices (eboards) where in some cases police have showed good interest in them (what they are etc)..

Of course this is very country depending.. so you should probably wait and hear from what other UK ppl can tell you.. besides that.. Germany/Holland in some cases.. seem to be the countries where you should be the most cautions or ''hide your e-board''.. not to get fine or something..

Thanks guys, I think I'm going to go through with the project, I've already ordered a few bits here and there and it would be a shame for them to go to waste lol, I asked this question just because I've never actually seen anyone where I live with an eboard

I've heard some stories about people getting a fine in the Netherlands, but that's only in the big cities, when they were racing past pedestrians.

Nope, I've bumped into them a few times and they've always been cool.

Once I was with a group, the police asked me to get off and walk as it was technically a pedestrianised area, then they saw the rest of the eboarders were heading off into the distance and so they said 'Ah forget it, off ya go', and let me ride away :slight_smile:

I find that as long as you ride safely and considerately to those around you, they won't give you any hassle.

@AlexJ Seems to be from London, Uk,

I think if you are outside of London (capital) you might as well be more safe.. though depends on how picky the police is.. perhaps he can shed some more light onto this, here

Yep, I am based in London, definitely a greater police presence here and chance of getting stopped. But as I say, even though it is technically illegal, as long as your ride courteously and considerately, chances are the only thing a bobby on the beat will do is ask you to stop and carry it if you're in a congested area or tell you how cool it is and ask you about it.

Outside of London the chance of being stopped is tiny I'd say, again as long as you're not jetting down pavements terrorising grannys at 20mph

I looked into this and its kind of a grey but not grey area. 

Those hoverboards are illegal, e-bikes with more than 250W motor and that power past 15.5mph are illegal. Well, illegal to use in a public place but totally fine on private land with permission. From what I can make out there is not an actual law for or against a 4 wheeled skateboard. This is the grey area. This means they can try to class your board as a 4 wheel electric vehicle and without plates, insurance and safety documents, the police can confiscate your board but from what I have read you can usually get it back with a slap on the wrists if you are not a dick about it. As Alex says, as long as you are not racing through people or traffic and not racing about the place they will just leave you alone.

I ride at a local park, its massive and open with few people around so no one to bother. I could not ride my board on the streets or pavements (eMTB, the opposite of stealth) without issues with people, traffic or police.

I have been commuting from Monday this week down cycle paths. A few of them are next to a main road and they pass the turning for the main town Police station.
I've seen 1 Police car pass me and the cops looked and 1 pointed and that was that.
I'd say I'm well placed to find out how they feel about it...

I rode past you on my board a little while back, @bigben :stuck_out_tongue:

That's interesting, I don't plan on drinking while on a board anyway so I guess it should be all okay, it's just a big of grey area and I doubt a lot of police would know what to do if they caught you on a board

Just to help, the answer seems to be an unfortunate yes :(

Hover boards were banned by 72 of the Highway Act 1835.

I am on my board everyday, often in central London, I have never had any issues. Been past massively secure buildings swarming with bored police (the most dangerous kind) - they don't care. I think unless you are driving like a cock and endangering people they are not going to bother you.

One thing that has been niggling me is the guy who has recently gone to prison for knocking a girl over while cycling a bike with only one brake and she died. If  bike with just a brake missing is enough to send him down they'd have a field day with an accident on a powered skateboard.
I'd say I am pretty safe and always slow down when passing anyone on the cycle paths but I guess you never know when someone is going to drift out when you're overtaking them.

it's all about riding defensively, yeah it's a PIA to have to slow down all the time but if it saves injury to yourself or someone else it's worth it. I am especially mindful of cars, it's fairly obvious who is going to win that one :slight_smile:
I think the biggest safety factor gain is remembering to constantly look over your shoulder and keep good spatial awareness of everything around you at all times - the potholes, grates and manhole covers don't make this easy to do but it's a necessity IMHO

I was going to quote this too, did so in a previous post. After reading it I ride on roads in London but my commute to work goes against the general flow of traffic so I have plenty of open roads and cycle lanes for the narrower parts.

I live in North London and have clocked just over 950 miles since building my board in May. I can say I've never had an issue and I believe its because I show consideration for my own and the safety of others (cars included).

Ride safe... And floor it when no one is looking

The common consensus is that they are not. e-bikes enjoy a special exemption provided that they meet a number of conditions (including a 15 mpg speed limiter), mobility scooters are actually allowed on pavements (and not roads) if they have a 8 mph speed limiter and quad bikes need to be registered with DVLA and that starts with obtaining what's called "type approval" (meaning you need breaks, rear view mirrors, registration plates, etc). In short, the police could argue an e-board is a carriage and would need DVLA approval. I am aware that a number of Silicon Valley start-ups are trying to get the UK's road laws modernised to accommodate electric skateboards and scooters but progress is slow. 

I have ridden about 15 miles a day on an Evolve board, mainly, around London. I tend to stick to the cycle lanes where police officers (in full view of me) seem content. I hear that, occasionally, the police in London blitz riders targeting e-boarders but if I were to see that ahead of me, I'd stop and walk pass them.

If you are on a pavement or boarding dangerously, I am sure the police would want to find an excuse to prosecute but my experience is that they are not particularly bothered.

I ride down embassy row and it is guarded by the police. They have never said anything apart from asking about my board and how I made it.
