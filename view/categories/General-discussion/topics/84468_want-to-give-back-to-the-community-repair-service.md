As a thanks to this wonderful community I would like to reach out and offer my iPhone/iPad repair services that cost the price of the part(s) and $15-$50 labor charge. I hate the fact that replacement shops make people pay $150 to replace a $50 screen. I do screen replacements and battery replacements.
You can pm me for specific phones and pricing or email dovid798@yahoo.com

Thanks again for all the help this community has given and all the knowledge I gained.

Have you noticed how easy it is to ruin the screen on a s8? I've had smart phones dating back to the beta iphone release and I have never used a cover or screen protector and never cracked a screen. I've had scratches but nothing major.

2 months with a s8 and the screen got a huge crack down the middle. Had it replaced and a few months later I took it out my pocket, no impact or anything like that and it had a huge spiderweb crack down the back. It's retired now, too much like hard work.

I once dropped my Nokia 3210 from 10cm and it put a hole in my floor and my cat died in the next room from the shockwave. They don't make these phones like they used to.

Aluminium backings are the go. Iâ€™ve got an old iPhone se and itâ€™s fucking indistructible. I drop that shit all day long from a meter plus on tiles and concrete and itâ€™s not even got a dent. All I have is a cheap $5 silicone case on it

I've ran my Moto X Pure without a case since it came out. In and out of pants, cars, laying around an oily ass machine shop... The leather backing looks amazing, and no part of the phone really has damage.

Unfortunately, despite having amazing hardware specs, the phone is an utter piece of shit.
