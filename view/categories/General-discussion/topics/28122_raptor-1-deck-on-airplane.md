Best thing to do is read their guidelines on their website AND call them and ask. Every airlines can have different rules.

Best is to ask JetBlue but I'm pretty sure you can't take it as carry on as it's to long. I'm flying a lot with my Inboard and I always check in the board and bring two batteries (12S1P) as carry on.
