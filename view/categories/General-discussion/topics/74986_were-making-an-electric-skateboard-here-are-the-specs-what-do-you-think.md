```
Top Speed - 40-45 km/hr
Range - 40km
Weight - around 10kg
6000 Watts of power from 2 motors that are belt driven
0-40km/hr in 3.5 seconds in "Track Mode"
PCB's are custom-designed. Internals will be completely unique, not cheap chinese components.
All components integrated into the deck. Deck will have a wooden finish (bamboo most likely). To a bystander, it will look like a normal longboard.
Traction control through an electronic differential.
Sleek and ergonomic controller with an OLED screen.

What are your thoughts? Any suggestions, comments and criticism is appreciated!

k traction control can be achieved through canbus connection between the 2 esc's. 

Use a vesc.

i wanna see how this deck will look. might be similar to the HAYA deck? 

You can use a firefly remote 

Please do more than 1hr reading on here 

please.

It'll be similar-ish to the HAYA deck, yeah. The idea is the same though, completely CNC'd and fully integrated.

I'm a new member, i'm sure i'll reach that 1 hour reading soon :)

What's a firefly remote?

We're working on a prototype, and i'd love to post pictures for the community later on when it's done.

I just wanted to hear from the esk8 community on the specs, to verify that we're on the right track! Do you have any thoughts?

this is good and all but you have no "specs". all you've mentioned is what it'll do and not what it'll contain or be constructed with.

What you said you want to do, has already been done in previous builds. 
It's possible.
So no feedback needed since you didn't make anything yet

Or, you could do the reading we suggested and find builds simular to your build and compare and contrast. Like it was already said, you're really not doing anything new that hasn't already been done before. Unless you make it hover. Then we can talk

How are you going to get the 6000 Watts of power from the motors? 

Curious if there's any thought behind this or if you're just posting motor watt rating times two?

Here let me help you : 

- what motors from which manufacturer? Size? Diam? Wire gauges ?
- which battery? Which cells? Layout? 12S6P Samsung 30Q?
- which wheels (ABEC, OTANG, CAG, BOA, MTB, ATS, etc...)? Size? Duro? 
- what about trucks? Size, model, Etc

List goes on. Then you can get feedback from builders.

:beers:

But in all seriousness, the general consensus surely is that putting stickers on your board is the easiest and most effective way to boost its specs and performance.

Letâ€™s go easy. 6000w from two motors or 3000w each is very achievable. He said they are making a custom esc, that could benefit us if they release it. They are using a diff thatâ€™s kinda cool at least.

Idk how they are gonna fit a 400wh+ battery in there and keep the weight at 10kg lol. 

Letâ€™s see it out before bashing the ideas

I'm all for new people bringing new stuff to the market, but as everyone else said....we want details!

This community is all about the true and realistic specs. Not some marketing "Much fast" Moar board big motor" "500000000 battery horse powers"

When you get a chance @gurbazD, I would like to see the actual specs of the motors, batteries, and esc.

I get you are developing a prototype, so it takes time, but you must have some ideas on specifics if you are developing it. Thanks man, and good luck.

It might be achievable, and then he/she/they could let us know the plan. I asked them to clarify. 

But what's the point of this thread anyway? Someone lists random specs, not build parts, and asks us what we think. What?? 

Like.. 
Guys, what do you think of my next build? Here are the specs;

top speed 50 mph
0-50 in 2 seconds
range 70 miles @ top speed and hilly / windy area (battery will have thousands of charge cycles and charges from 0-full in 30 minutes.
weight 10 pounds
Will climb any hills and riding street or terrain will be equally great without changing wheels! (secret wheels with new tech)
it will be super stealthy and ride will be butter smooth

Do you like it? Should I change any specs before finalizing the build?

Righto.  This to me is obviously not a build thread but an attempt at getting information for a new pre-built.
Fine but be honest.  We can help but not if duped into it.  This is a builders forum.  First and foremost.  You want to feed the masses with another meepo then by my guest.  Just use another resource.

Thank you for all the responses everyone.

Best of luck on your building ventures :)

If you want to build something great, here are a lot of people with a lot of experience. 
Just ask the right questions.
Nobody will tell you what you should do, but if you come up with detailed infos about the hardware you plan to use, we can help you to figure out if things will work out as you want them to do or not.

Don't get frustrated and get the gears running :beers: 

We're passionate and a bit rough but understand that we see a **lot** of random shit going around on every day basis.

Core message of everything you've read is : at least get a detailed part list and present it to the community. You can even start making it here and correct it later. Even if it is for future commercial use, it's OK. We like it when brands are honest and close to the team.

I mean, we know which are quality or shitty parts and we got marathon and dragsters boards here, so we know what is required to achieve specs.

Good luck on your project.

Edit : By "we know" I refer to experienced builders (there are many here) who allowed folks like me to learn along tte way.
