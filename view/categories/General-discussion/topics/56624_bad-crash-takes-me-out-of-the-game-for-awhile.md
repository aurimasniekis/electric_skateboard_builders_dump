Last night, I was riding back to my fiances house. Apparently, the lights on my back went out without me noticing. Around 12:00am, a car came speeding up behind me. I turned around and flashed my light at them, and they swerved away about 10 feet before hitting me. I sped up in case they didn't see me in time, wobbled, and fell about 32mph. They stopped and helped me, actually took me home. Another car came by and didn't see my board, and ran it over. Entire right side is scraped up, and board is completely destroyed.

Good news I guess is that I get to build it exactly how I want after having more experience :joy: but it's gonna be awhile before I rejoin the community due to money.

Some Pictures![20180524_005005|281x500](upload://kyxXHVh3MFkQJ37CRvv6M4ZyqcG.jpg)![20180524_000044|375x500](upload://wrX2CbzHbUVBJERoEewT01sjkf5.jpg)

Also, quick PSA, always wear a helmet!! Probably wouldn't be here without it, looking at the scrapes on the visor. I'm also gonna be getting a motorcycle jacket, and padded hip protectors. Probably a lighter helmet too.

Anyways, thanks everyone for the awesome community I got to be a part of. I can't wait to get back in!

Hope ya feel better man.

I pretty much always ride withan armor suite. And throw on a kevlar shirt/hoodie for night riding.

If you are looking for those things
Leatt 5.5 body protector, or evs street vest(spine and rooost ) are good.
And the best hip pads are Hillbilly Hip Protectors.

Others might not say it. As you need to clean daily using this method. But I've always kept my road rashes wet, as to not impede my range of motion when it scabs over. If you keep it wet just clean and redress often.

Ouch man road rash isn't fun, hopefully you didn't hurt anything inside. You're definitely going to feel this tomorrow

If you haven't ground off some skin on the pavement before, just take care of it like you would the aftercare of a tattoo. Feel better man can't wait to see the newly revamped build

Baths feel great. I mostly mean with ointments(not water). I normally use A&E oinments as it has the vitamins in it the skin uses most to heal. Or Alocain burn cream. Depending on how deep it is. Start off with a cream so the wound can still breath. Then moved to A&E once it stops making the yellowish red blood plasma purges so it starts moisturizing. And make sure to stay hydrated :slight_smile:

Also if you want the scars to subsided continue to apply a&e for 3-4 months after the wounds are healed. Glad your mostly ok :)

Pick up some tegederm
https://www.amazon.com/Tegaderm-Transparent-Dressing-Inch-Count/dp/B0009Q01AO
That should take care of your hip.

Keep that sucker moist, but use oil based things like Vaseline or neosporin instead of water based stuff like creams and lotions because water will actually cause skin maceration.

For your shoulder I'd just use gauze pads and paper tape. Lots of vaseline, at least for a couple days.

Try to get their insurance company to pay you for the board and your injuries. You should be able to quickly make another in that case. Glad you could walk away from that

I've taken to wearing one of these:

From what I read, you got it cheap.

The second build is always at least 100% better

Thanks everyone for the well wishes!

@Deckoz I will absolutely take that advice. I'm probably not ever gonna step on a board without full gear again :joy: that was just too close. I've been using something called Melogel, it's kinda like neosporin. Thanks for all the advice!

@SuperBen As far as I can tell its just bruised muscles on the inside. I certainly have, fell another time due to speed wobbles and ripped up my hands :joy: I basically am doing what deckoz said.

@GrecoMan I hurt my hands pretty bad in a similar manner, cleaned them constantly though.

@CHAINMAILLEKID Skin maceration sounds gross and painful. Will definitely follow that advice. For now I'm just letting everything heal over.

@amazingdave Hope that moment never comes!

@Sapphirinia Naw, it wasn't their fault. I was riding on the road, and my lights went out without me realizing so  she couldn't see me. She drove me home, that was enough for me!

@cosmicc89 Fantastic idea! That will certainly be on the list of safety gear.

@Eboosted yeah, I really wasn't expecting to be a statistic in that :joy: I'm certainly excited about the second build!

Never ever clean a wound with soap please! So much stuff in that¬¥s definitely worse than not cleaning it at all!

There is enough special stuff that helps you clean it. Just ask in your next pharmacy

Regular soap is just lard and sodium hydroxide.  It's sterile on production.

You should definitely clean wounds.

You need a back-up rear light, I usually have a bike light powered by it's own battery (not the motor battery) strapped to the back trucks or deck.
Or something on your clothes or helmet (better if it's on the board so you don't forget it).

Congrats on the use of a helmet. And sorry about your board.

@b264 @Blitz @TarzanHBK 

I used hydrogen peroxide to clean the wounds, and have been keeping ointment on it as per @Deckoz advice. Putting that on was by far the most pain I've ever been in... Almost passed out and threw up multiple times :ghost:

Get well soon.
As a former cyclist, road rash is part of the game. Hot showers and scrubbing with a rough sponge or loofa to avoid scabs forming and cleaning the wounds is the standard approach.
Yes, it is as painful as it sounds but accelerates the healing.

People don't tend to use Hydrogen Peroxide anymore as its so aggressive and kills damaged and undamaged cells, making the healing take longer, and makes scaring worse. I'm not sure you'll find doctors or nurses recommending it anymore.

Just soap and water should be enough.

Thing is just plain soap is actually really good at its job.
