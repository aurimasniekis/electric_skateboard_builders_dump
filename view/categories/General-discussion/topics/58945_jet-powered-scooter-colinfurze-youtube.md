I subscribe to **colinfurze** on youtube and today he published a video about a Jet powered scooter!

It's got a Lipo, a speed controller and what looks like a brushless motor electric turbine! (so very much like an electric board! errm... well minus the turbine LOL) . Has anyone recently experimented with this? I know there was a thread a few years ago with a video from the Hacksmith _(who was actually going to visit Collin)._

It seemed to work quite well and despite the noise from it, I wonder how feasible it would be if it were board mounted. Just something Interesting that I thought I'd share with yall!
