sooo. last Thursday i took a gnarly spill off my board resulting in a fractured olecranon (elbow). going into surgery saturday (and im scared shitless). 

the story goes;
i had just excitedly installed my new 12s (upgrading from 8s lipo) pack onto my board after not riding since last summer. the new pack had to be put on a stiffer deck since my old one had too much flex. the only stiffer deck i had was much shorter. instead of ordering a more suitable deck, i was so anxious to try my new toy, i threw on my helmet and headed out the door, figuring itd be just a short ride and id be back soon. my board on 8s would reach about 45km/h on BLDC, and i had set up my board with FOC for 12s. i made it about 2 blocks from my house before i started braking at about 40km/hr (on the shorter deck than im used to), and the brakes were soo powerful the board twisted from under me, and i went flying, it happened so fast. left elbow out, road rash on my left hip, both knees, right palm, left elbow, and of course a fractured olecranon (which needs a plate and some screws to fix). ive never broken a bone and am scared shitless, but it was my own stupidity and it could have been much worse. anyone who doesn't have full safety gear (elbow pads, knee pads, wrist guards, and helmet), i ask you PLEASE get some before you learn like i did. I thought i was fine with my awesome looking TSG pass( which made it without a scratch...almost wish i hit my head instead lol), but look at me now.

Wish you a good recovery. I had a wisdom tooth that was growing at 90* against the tooth beside it. it fractured while they attempted to get it out and the root stayed in my jaw. They had to drill a hole into the root so they could stick a metal rod in it and wedge it loose around my jaw...anyway what I'm trying to say is don't be scared.

I feel your pain. Had the same accident few months back, fractured both my ulna and radius, and needed to put a plaque inside.
Same story, new board, 12s inside, with Enertion drive train, shorter board, stronger brake, slipped under me, fell on my wrist, broke everything....

Stay safe, and no worries for the surgery, they know what they are doing ;)

Wishing you fast healing man. If you pump money into quality gear it doesnâ€™t feel as clunky and you are more likely to wear it

You already have the good helmet

Look at POC gear for knees/elbows

Holy F that looks bad! Am i glad mine was only the lower part of the elbow. Did not even change colour. The advantage of surgery is that as soon as the scars from the operation are healed you can start with therapy to regain movement. So it looks crap now, but in the end it might take you less time to be fully back on your feet.

What do people think of the motox padded suits with elbow guards and spine protection that you can wear underneath a tee shirt? 

I already have wrist guards from snowboarding setup and a bmx helmet (which I am hoping to swap out for a full face fox or ruroc setup)

Maybe try an armored hoodie.

I think @sender fell with his on and said it helped quite a bit, he was wearing the lazy rolling one. They are quite expensive!!

TSG also makes some insane mountain bike armor that looks like it would be the best upper body protection possible.

Finally got my cast off 2 days ago...and man is my arm stiff. Its visibly smaller due to the muscle atrophy, and i can really only bend it a few degrees from where it was locked with my cast on. Doc said im supposed to work on range of motion slowly and i have an appt to see him again in 4 weeks. it feels good to be out of the cast, but it also feels shitty still not being able to move my arm really. just glad im one more step towards making my recovery. here are some pics. the two with the flash on are pretty much as soon as i got home from the hospital before a shower, they still show the road rash; but after the shower the scab came off soo easily (it almost made breaking my elbow worth it! lol).

Nice scar.  I've broken a few bones and had some plates put in.  They heal relatively fast and usually very well.  You'll be back out in no time.

If you have to do PT, do exactly what the PT tells you and dont slack off.  Pick up some dumb bells for eventual strength training to build up those biceps for the ladies

thanks for the advice...no PT yet, im following up with the doc in 3 weeks and he's gonna see my progress and we'll move from there i guess (he didn't even mention PT). Right now my elbow is still pretty swollen, and very stiff, and painful to try and extend or flex. I've been trying to use my arm as much as possible to try and get rid of the stiffness; im finding it much easier to extend my arm (i can straighten it a good bit more than I could right after taking the cast off), but flexing my arm is so brutally stiff and painful, im trying daily to stretch it and bend it but i really cant get much past the 90 degrees where it sat in the cast for so long. i can juuuuuust touch my nose with the tip of my thumb if i assist with my good hand for stability and that is pretty stiff and painful. but it is progress, i couldnt do that a few days ago, and now i can even put on deodorant so I dont smell so bad :stuck_out_tongue:

yeesh thats a rough one... had my major accident a few months back almost fully healed but was able to ride after a couple weeks... moral of the story (yours) should be dont go ripping up the street on any board you havent yet tested to see how it responds... 8 to 12s im sure was a fun jump till u hit the brakes lol
