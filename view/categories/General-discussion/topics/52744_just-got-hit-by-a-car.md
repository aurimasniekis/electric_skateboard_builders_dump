As the title says, just got hit by a car!
A business guy in his company's car was rushing and overrun a stop sign. Luckily my speed was just around the 20miles mark. When i saw the car coming i did a big jump and tried to run it off, but after one step i slammed on my knees.
My pants and shoes are ripped and he ran over my board twice. If i hadn't jumped he would have run straight over me. Man have i been lucky!!
In Japan Skateboarding and especially esk8 is completely forbidden, so i opted for not calling the police and he offered me cash for the ripped clothes and visible damage of my board. But it's only a fraction of what I have got riding a bicycle.
I do a 15mile commute every day, now i am really reconsidering esk8's as a commuting device. I am scared as shit.
The battery didn't catch fire but i have not checked it properly yet. The Voltage disply didn't showed any fast voltage drops but i will take it apart and check all the connections.
Man my leg hurts, my confidence is gone, just because of a stupid fucker rushing in a car.
Take care everybody, wear helmets and kneepads, i hope at some point we will have the same rights than bicycles.

Glad your safe and sound. Sleep in it, you'll feel better about the situation tomorrow, maybe you will wanna stick with esk8. 

Either way glad you didn't get hurt to bad.

We must develop ESP for hazards to stay alive during commuting. Good job minimizing damage.

Glad you are okay.  If you really like ESkating I encourage you to get back on the board when you are able to.  Go slow at first but it helps get over the trauma from the accident.  Hope you can salvage the board.

sucks about your board dude, glad you're not banged up too bad :hugs:

Glad you're alright dude. The problem with us being esk8ers is that most people in their cars see us and think "it's just a guy on a skateboard" and don't understand that we're cruising at 30+ mph. They just can't grasp it yet. 

I've been street skating for about 24 years. I've never been hit by a car before. Only Esk8ing going on 3 years now. I've been hit by 2 cars and 1 truck just weeks ago. I'm glad to be alive. :slight_smile: 

But... I've been esk8ing everyday since. It's way too much fun building and conjuring up new ideas. Hope you heal fast dude!!! And do as @mmaner says and sleep on it. It might change your mind. ;)

[/quote]

Man..I was afraid of my board for a few days because my shoulder. Haha mostly because even walking was jostling it and causing irritating pain. As I had not ever been physically thrown from my magic carpet before. Those first few days even looking at the board was like no...just no.. it was upsetting, concerned if would even be able to get back on with any confidence.

I didn't ride again for 6 days. Waiting for a new TSG pass. Since I smacked my head pretty hard.

Strapping on a new helmet, that wasn't broken in in the cheek pads, and the anxiety felt like claustrophobia.. the first few minutes were terrifying. To the point that I went home and took a long walk up the hill with my analog deck to prove to myself it's not me... Rode the hill. Few Colemans. Shoulder was a little sensitive but I was confident in me.. 

Stared at the electric for another couple days until I finally forced myself to take a normal ride to my friends a couple developments over..felt a little better.. then realized I forced myself into also riding home. After a bit and a couple more days of known routes it passed..

But yeah.. get on a board..even if it's analog.. learn from it.. take some extra time when skating on the street.

Thank you all for the encouraging words!!
I love you all üòç !!!!
My leg which took the first step after jumping, starts badly hurting now. The pain is around the knee and foot ankle, but it's not swollen, i hope it gets better in a few days.
But the worsest thing is to be stripped of all rights. If I had opted for the police, i would have to pay a fine and had trouble with my driving license, especially as a foreigner here.
All my japanese workmates are looking at me like, "i told ya skateboarding is a crime and that's your fault".
But usually i am not the guy who gives in too easily.
I did street skating for quite a while, so I am good at falling and that prevented more physical damage. I was wearing a helmet but no kneepads, ironically they are on the way to me.
But my partner will get mad on me, she was against it from the beginning on.
Really thank you all reading through this, I hope I can salvage some parts out of my machine and get on it with more confidence.

I got hit by a car that ran a stop sign too.  She just blew it like it wasn't even there.  I smashed the whole side of her car up, because at the time it would hurt me less to use her car to stop me than to try to bail and fall, so I used her car to stop me.  Her car was fucked up bad.  Police were called.  Her insurance called me too and I refused to give them any statements, referring them to the police report.  I hope they raised her insurance rates triple.... because she deserves to lose her license.

Eskating is non existend here, i got stopped twice but they weren't aware that my board is electrified.
Thry just told me to ride it in the park and get off it for now. But the non awareness is also the culprit here, because no one anticipates a guy on a skateboard.

get ice on it dude
elevate the leg

don't test it or massage it, that will only inflame it further.

keep icing it on and off for up to the first 12 hours after the injury, if it is serious? It will reduce the severity of the damage.

Everything skate related is really minor here.

Cracked  my ribs avoiding a car myself. Luckily my board rolled away safely. I had to get up and ride to work. I now always slow down assuming a car is coming.  You will realize how much you enjoy esk8 and learn from this accident. Heal up and stay safe

Yeah. I use the same thought process as if I'm on my motorcycle.  I assume the driver didn't see me and I prepare to stop just in case.  Not the solution to every scenario but every bit helps.

I took the same approach lately but unfortunately it wasn't enough today. In the beginning i did this commute in roughly 45 min. Lately i did it in 1h and 15 min.
Traffic is just crazy here. It's just Asia a culture of giving your rights away.

I've gotten used to it lately that if someone doesn't notice me on their cars and about to hit, i'll just wave my hands like a lunatic, and they do a panic brake :D It's been working so far :smile:

All eBoarders should be aware of the situation;

**ABSOLUTELY** no one in a car will think of us as an electrified vehicle, so if you're driving on streets or paths that cross streets where cars drive, always drive very foresighted!

This is actually a rising problem. More and more builder build 10s - 12s boards. It's easy to manage this speed on a park and I have to say the speed over 30kmh is fantastic to ride. However I do agree that it's too fast for a vehicle that can't brake instant without throwing you off the vehicle it's self. And trust me no one really expect someone to go over 30kmh on a skateboard. Very dangerous.

Yes, I totally agree with you.
That‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt get mad on this guy. He was coming out of a tight street with low visibility around the corners. Here in Japan at this kind of intersections they have mirrors installed at the opposite site that drivers can see coming traffic. I guess he looked and just thought that I am a pedestrian. But at this kind of corner just everyone has to stop and he was just going too fast.
Man iam really glad that I got out of this with just one now completely locked up leg and some ripped clothes.
The battery seems to be fine, it still holds the same capacity then after the accident. But I still haven‚Äôt had the time to properly check it.

Edit*
Before i build my board i was doing the same commute on a bicycle with disc brakes, but at todays accident even disc brakes wouldn't have changed anything, he was just running straight in to me. I guess, would i have been on a bicycle today my injuries would be much worse.

Sounds like you strained the complex of ligaments around your knee and possibly pulled a muscle. Take naproxen sodium and try to keep off of it for about a week or two. Getting a knee wrap / brace will help too.

Thing is driver don't know if skateboard can go as fast as car, not to mention the esk8.

If it was here in Canada, I would rip him off or would sue him for good. 

I like Japan so no offense, but transportation there is ridiculous. Bike law is weird subway is a maze.
Can't wait to visit this winter :sweat_smile:

I agree @Acidfie. Always ride with the mindset that the cars are going to hit you. It can creep up on you, it has to me before also. Never trust anyone. Always scan and look for cars that look like they might move and people in general.

ive been hit by a taxi driver who completely ignored the stop sign as well. my entire body was slammed on the hood and i was able to put my arms between my head and the hood so i did not get hurt i walked it off but sadly my board was badly damaged. funny thing is if it was electric one i would have had brakes and im sure i would have prevented the accident but oh well thanks to that incident im very careful now. you dont get to say its my right to pass they should wait. that mentality is wrong and unhealthy.

So you longboard on the road and don't even know how to footbrake?

And I get the vibe that you weren't wearing a helmet correct me if I'm wrong,

Here in Japan in the most populated areas, streets are tight and don't have sidewalks. The street, the guy came out, had buildings right up to the corner so that his view was completely blocked. For that reason there are mirrors installed on the opposite site of the crossing. When I drive my car at those intersections I completely stop, check the mirror and go slowly in to the street because visibility in the mirrors is also not 100%.
He was fast, thats why he ran over the skateboard with front and rear tires, could not stop his car quick enough. And he apologized and admitted that he was rushing immediatley.

My accident happened the same exact way, like EXACTLY.  If I hadn't jumped off, I surely would be injured for life. 

Gives me the chills reading your story man.  I really wish people would look twice out there. I hope you get your board back up and running. Glad you are ok!

footbrake is the most important thing to learn when you ride a normal skateboard. you cant even ride without knowing how to do that so making an assumption that i dont know how to footbrake is abit pointless. also its not a magical thing to stop you in an instant. 
my normal skateboard helmet is helpless when it comes to protect my chin and my nose, full face thats another level but i dont have it.

I feel you man some roads have incredibly low visibility and to prevent an accident slowing down at those intersections is the only solid way. I had the similar accident, in my case I noticed the car and after around one second I was on it‚Äôs hood :slight_smile: I couldn‚Äôt shake it off just like you and I stopped riding my board and it was my daily commute to work but over time you will get over it and you will come back even stronger. Just be careful sometimes reaction time is very limited and you can‚Äôt really do anything, it‚Äôs better to slow down in those particular situations. Prediction and evaluation while riding is underrated. This also applies for motorcycle riders.

They are not aware that something like eskates exist, they just think that it is a regular longboard. Most of them just ignore you, but i got told twice to not ride it on the street, one time they let me continue home, the other time they ask me to get off and carry the board home.
But if you are running a board with rear mounted motors which makes a lot of noise you will get in trouble i think. All sorts of electric vehicles except pedelecs are strictly prohibited here.
But that will hopefully change, in such a densely populated country as Japan, ultraportable electric vehicles like esk8 is just the way to go. At some point they will realise that!
