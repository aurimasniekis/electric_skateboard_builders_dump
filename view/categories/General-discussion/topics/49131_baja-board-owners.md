Baja boards isnâ€™t very well covered on our forum. Maybe for good reason. Do you own a Baja board? Share your experience. Why donâ€™t you own a Baja? Is it price? 

Iâ€™m thinking about picking up a used board, but no one has them up for sale.

This guy in VA messaged me on FB today to try to get some ride in with us....

I believe he said @Kaly built this

Apparently it's like a 6k build.

I don't know If he's on the forums..

I met a couple of the guys who run the company in Aus last year, really nice bunch of people. 

Got to try out one of the 4WD builds briefly. They're really quite different from any other board I've tried (unsurprisingly). Insane amount of power and the suspension is really nice as well

Upgraded components Iâ€™m guessing? Jeez I didnâ€™t want it at the 5 k mark lol. 
That looks pretty sweet, wish I could find someone getting rid of one on the cheap

I think they are trying to lose weight lately, there is scope in that dept.E.g. they are ditching the headway cells afaik. It's a lot of machine would love to try one

You've probably seen it already but they've started taking pre-orders for models that'll be starting at around $2.2k USD

Don't own one, main issue is weight. 

I kind of feel like this esk8 'thing' would be a good fit for a last mile/public transport travel. That means I'd need to be able to carry it around. My Trampa is on the too heavy side, and a BajaBoard weighs double that!

Price no longer seems like such an issue. BajaBoard G4 (2WD) goes for $2800 (AUD), whereas a Raptor 2 is $2059 (AUD). That's a pretty easy upsell to me, if it wasn't so damn heavy.

They're local to me. Wonder if they'd do a 'rolling chassis' ðŸ¤”

Ah I just realised at this stage it's for Aus and NZ only. I expect they'll ship to all their normal markets later on though. Sounds like they've been able to reduce the cost a fair bit cause they're in the process of setting up a dedicated production line etc. 

Looks like the 4wd models will be starting at $3150USD

Wow 3150 is far more affordable. Maybe Iâ€™ll wait for those preordered to pick one up.

Hi there guys 

My impressions on the Bajaboard. 

The Baja is a beast unlike anything out there so far, it is on a league of it own, to approach it you need to go in with an OPEN mind. 

PROS. 
As a purpose oriented board I think it is the top of the pack. 
super powerful and will obliterate any off-road trail, acceleration is just crazy insane, man insane. 

CONS. 
Hard to tame and handle, it does not handle like a board, the maneuverability is greatly compromised due to the size, weight and suspension system. 

In short IMO a well design eMTB should be like a DirtBike, agile, manageable weight and over the top power delivery system. 
![image|625x500](upload://tx0RBLLwbRIp2wbcGAfH8JpNsJs.jpeg)

 The Baja feels more like a ATV
![image|500x333](upload://jtuamEDgcV3IcsrQJRTBV1ELmLN.jpeg)

There is a lot of fun to have on it, You know it can perform, the power and engineering are there. 

In the end is about the preference of the end user, because I have seen amazing things done on a dirtbike and  on an ATV as well.

I know it's not a Baja board, but maybe these have some potential, for science at least. I'd think that with your reputation and clout around here, you could get good deal from Jason @DIYEboard on a rolling board kit and build it up yo to your specs. I'd be really curious to see what you could do with one of these and how the quality and durability measure up.

My sister used to work as their PR/social marketer so I've had enough experience riding it.

I can say with confidence that I agree with everything you've said. It has the power and capability to go anywhere and is basically in a league of it's own. However the weight and form factor really compromises it's agility and handling. Feels more like a bloody monster truck under your feet.

I own one.. 

lol those lights are the same I added :) I heard about this guy who they sold a shell too from Bajaboard, they offered to sell me a G4x shell, I'm going for the internals then the external shell when I've thrashed my g3 to death.

* Speed wobbles still has them but you can tighten secondary springs
* The weigh is the killer, I've hurt myself carry the board more than falling off it
* The length is annoying it will not fit in my car 'boot/trunk' without a seat down  
* I owned Bajaboard for 2 year and never felt that 'endless sphere feeling' until I deck swapped a meepo onto an 80s deck 
* It can do over rocks and terrain I cannot walk over 
* It seems to be indestructible, I've been trying to break mine to justify an upgrade for >6months
* zero voltage sag BUT does cutout when you give it too much power 
* its not a last mile thing its a last 10mile over anything
* I use it where I used to ride my mountain bike 
* It is so boring riding this on 'good surfaces' unless your at speed 
* I have say its not a skateboard feels more like a snowboard 
* I STILL get stunned when I push it harder and faster and it still copes 
* Its more of a scaled down full EV rather than scaled 

@barajabali the cheaper model only has 2WD but you are just going to be disappointed you don't have the 4WD

@Mobutusan I'm considering using this to hold my spare parts after upgrade (battery, motherboard and remote)

the thing I keep on asking them is "where is the bajaboard mini" I would pay ANYTHING for a board I can carry with me like 'normal deck'

So I asked about this when I got mine, when you feel the weight of this you DO NOT want that stuck you your feet going in another direction from your body its WAY to heavy for that.

Sadly not that I'm aware of, one was promised when I bought mine in 2015 but nothing ever came of it.

I've never seen a second hand one for sale, if I wanted to get one I'd ask George at Bajaboard if any customers (like me) are considering upgrades from a G3 and maybe want to sell the complete board. 

My upgrade is needed to get this remote, my G3 has no way to tell the battery level this is really annoying after using the likes of meepo and diy kits. (apparently this remote is often the decider for buyers!)

Hello guys :slight_smile:
I'm also a recent owner of a bajaboard g4x and love it too.
I agree with what other people said, this board is huge in all the significatin of huge.
Huge power, huge offroad capacities, but also huge weight and too huge to fit in my trunk.
It definitely needs to go off road to have a lot of fun :stuck_out_tongue:slight_smile:slight_smile:
In the forest or MTB trails it's just awesome.
 Agree also that the price is steep, especially in Europe, but it's definitely a class of its own.
I owned several boards before (evolve and DIY) and it's really another experience.
I can't compare it to a Trampa based setup, but for me it's another league as one said.

Yep, the remote is great, I mean, the e-diff is really a nice feature as you can change the behavior of the boards during turns to make it keep speed, or decrease speed for example.
The launch control is fun as hell, the fact that you can change everything from the speed ramp to the max power available and so on is clearly a plus.
You also get stats from your trip and so on.
So definitely a big impovment over the previous remote I guess.

I ordered the Pantera last week.  What sold me was the offroad capabilities, acceleration and torque also was impressed with the remote and tuning capabilities. My experience with the company thus far has been good they are quick to reply to emails, and transparent about their product.  

I researched the board extensively before purchase and had a hard time finding any reocurring complaints, other then the obvious weight, maneuverabilty and price gripe (mostly from people who dont own them).  

For me the Pantera was the best choice due to the fact that a fully upgraded 2018/19 G4x ( including alloy rims and controller, larger battery, lights) plus shipping and handling is around $5400.  The Pantera includes all the afore mentioned and s/h is included in the full price.  Factor in the added  power and potential performance upgrades (if needed already has ridiculous power.)  Was the best option imo.
