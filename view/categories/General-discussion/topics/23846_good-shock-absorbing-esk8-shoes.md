Just curious what you guys are skating in. I was wearing some doc martens that are actually a skate type shoe with my humongous custom orthotics in them and I feel everything. I'm not sure how much of a skate shoe is appropriate for eskating as opposed to something more shock absorbing. Once I hit those city streets I know it's definitely going to be an even more bumpy road. Flat for grip or squishy for comfort?
