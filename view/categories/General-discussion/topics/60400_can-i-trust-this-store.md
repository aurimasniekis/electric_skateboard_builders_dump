Is  trustworthy? 

* If you leave the tab, the page title starts blinking "Wait, where did you go? Don't forget this..."
* Bottom left hand corner (and occasional full page css popup) says you can "win a prize!"
* "Customer support" chat automatically pops up and starts talking to you, *with sound*.
* On mobile, there's the ubiquitous "sign up to our newsletter" popup that always appears when you're trying to read an article or look at a product. Only, it reads "Win a special prize!" instead.
* Every once in awhile, to create fake urgency about product demand, a popup appears telling me that (name) in (location) just purchased (product).  

I know the owners of the site probably frequent this forum, so I hope to learn what is the purpose of these horrors. For myself, it just makes me less likely to trust your store.

I think the site is "built" (clicked together) with Shopify, these are just annoying options and/or plugins that you can simply add to your shop using shopify. Pretty bad pratices webdesign/UX wise, I agree. They are active on this forum as @torqueboards and are very reliable AFAIK.

Those are basic elements of marketing in these days. Their products are legit and if I’m right they are one of the first diy part brands.
