I will soon be moving out of my small apartment into our new house and with a garage come possibilities.
I am shopping around for CNC mills right now.
Here is the clear winner but it comes at a steep price.
The tormach 440
https://www.tormach.com/store/index.php?app=ecom&ns=prodshow&ref=35683&portrelay=1

Here is something I might consider just because its so cheap.
The Blue Elephant 1212
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Water-Cooling-1500W-Spindle-CNC1212-CNC-Router-CNC-Engraving-Machine-1-5kw-VFD-CNC-Router-4x4/32775042660.html?traffic_analysisId=recommend_2056_null_null_null&scm=1007.13438.91317.0&pvid=c3e2c203-0b44-4e5e-a1d1-727c58ad1133&tpp=1

Got anything else?
No x-carve or openbuilds machines.

my local makerspace has a tormach 1100
![image|500x500](upload://8FjrDEU9QVUVzZTRDCXyXqzTdt.jpeg)
they’ve also got a cnc plasma cutter, it’s what I plan on making trucks with.
![image|640x425](upload://7W9CdZmPiGlEiQ111MHp35PRjsx.png)
they’ve got a fuck ton of manual and CNC lathes and mills, huge shopbots, casting equipment, etc but I use those 2 the most often

mine also has a waterjet and a large vac former but I don’t use either very often

lol. it’s not all wonderful 😉

gotta take the checkout classes for each machine, ($25-$115) a piece and also a membership on top of that, I think it’s $450 per year for students or $900 normally. let me know when you’re going 😋

The Taigs are super nice little mills, and not too expensive with the CNC conversion kit.  But at the end of the day it is a desktop mill.

http://www.taigtools.com/cmill.html

I've made all the parts for my eBoards on it.

I've been keeping an eye on the Goliath CNC...still hasn't been released yet but looks promising. But I don't think it's designed for professional industrial work...more for hobbyists and personal projects.

If you can manage, all the manufacturers around me use Haas Mills. They are the industry standard. If you can find a makerspace around, or a manufacturing willing to take the time to cut your parts, that will be ideal

Goliath CNC
[/quote]

As someone who spent the first 4 years of my work life doing CNC and manual milling I dont see the Goliath performing anywhere near what I am looking for. Woodchips will ruin any measurement for the z axis.

My high school had 2 Haas CNC VF2 Mills and 2 Haas CNC TL Lathes. They were great when paired with solid works and MasterCamX7. 
Although idk what those cost, might be out of the budget for a personal CNC.

I’m running a Old Kira VTC30 with Fanuc control in my home shop. Getting a brand new one was out of my budget but solid built old cnc machines still have very good precision. Not as fast as the newer mills with huge lookahead buffers and insane speeds but it’s quick enough for what I do as long as it’s not fancy 3D surface work. What are you going to mill? 

Short clip of mine removing som alu. Just a test without coolant.

Last I checked they're working on an integrated dust vac for it. But it's one of many reasons why I'm keeping my eye on it instead of jumping out and putting money down on one : too many ifs and not enough evidence it can perform up to par. That and I've seen too many kickstarter projects crash and burn to feel comfortable putting my money into one.

All in all though, it's still an interesting concept.

Nice machine! I want to be able to mill what ever I want. So the tormach is kinda what I am leaning towards. But I'll probably only ever do aluminum.

No cnc unfortunate, but building one out from old lathe dovetail guides, as you can see on the pics.
Still a lot work to do...
I would get the tormach if i had the money for it:)

Could look at getting a Little machine shop mini Hitorque mill and converting it. Would be about 3k for mill, conversion kit, cnc electronics, and some miscellaneous stuff you would need.

I ran a dual torch cnc plasma cutter for 3 years on my job when I worked nights.
I've cut up to 2" thick steel on it. Fun times.
Now I'm back on the day shift and hand welding Stainless pipe.

Hey guys, I am the owner of a cnc machine shop and production facility in Boise, Idaho. Recently I have become pretty involved in esk8 riding and some custom building. Obviously I have a lot of great equipment, and the skillset to utilize them, so please let me know if you would like to do any prototyping or small runs of your custom parts. I can be messaged here or emailed at andrew(AT)ICEBIRGPRESS.com

@jboren - Thanks a ton! Yeah we have a lot of fun. I just recently got into Esk8ing with a Evolve Bamboo Gen2 (single motor) which I quickly gave to the wife and replaced with a Carbon GT. Absolutely loving the sport, we should for sure go for a ride soon!.
