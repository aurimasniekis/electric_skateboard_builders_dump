Curious on the size/type people have used for the nose/tail trim rubber replacement. Kicked mine off tonight and just looking to replace it.

Bump!

I've bought a few different types and they have all been to small for the edge.  Curious if anyone could let me in a source for something.

Can you provide me a link to the one you bought.  So far I have tried two different widths and both were to small to fit over the lip.
