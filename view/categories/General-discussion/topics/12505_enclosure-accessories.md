I got a battery from . It has a switch, charging port, and usb ports built into it. I also have a vacuum formed enclosure from psychotiller. I guess I have to make some holes in the enclosure access everything. I noticed alot of ppl here have grommets and covers. 

What should I use? I won't be riding in the rain or anything, but Id like to keep dirt and the occasional puddle away from the battery.

This is my ugly prototype but here's mine with the same battery and a psychotiller custom. It's never fallen off and the magnets make it easy to put back on while it's on the ground.

For the fuel guage I cut a lexan window and attached it with sugru around the edges. I beveled the window with sand paper.

@psychotiller threw in some small strong magnets with my order and I used a dab of sugru to glue them inside the enclosure around the access holes. Then I placed magnets on top, stuck to their counterparts. Each with another drop of sugru on top. Then I squashed a piece of lexan onto the magnets at let it dry. 

After that was dry I put a layer of sugru on the lexan between the enclosure, careful to leave the magnets exposed and as close as possible for a strong hold. I also stuck a little sugru ball on the lexan to fill in the acess holes. Before fitting it in place I covered the enclosure with soapy water so the sugru wouldn't stick. Then pressed it into place and molded the edges into a seal. Then squished the little sugru lumps with my finger from the underside to fill in the seal and lift the whole thing up off the enclosure for drying. I went back when it was dry and covered the top and added a little tab for pulling it off. 

It's rough and ugly. Someday I'll make a nicer one that's not so lumpy but it works great!

I told myself I'd cut a hole for the usb ports if I ever experience a situation where I need to charge a device with my board. So far I haven't felt a need to use it.
