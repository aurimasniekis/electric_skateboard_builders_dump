So long story short; I live in Norway and lately it has gotten more difficult to recieve esk8 packages (complete boards etc) so I was wondering if a friendly swede near the Norwegian boarder could help me out and recieve the board for. Me and then I can just drive to sweden to pick it up. Prefferably someone living close to Ã…re

I will of course compensate for the trouble!

Hopeful for a reply!
