Who has experience routing slots in bamboo decks? Like what’s the best way to do it,and what to do after routing like using fiberglass/resin? I just don’t want my board to break in half

```
Use a down-cutting router bit or endmill, this will keep tearing and splitting to a minimum. Keep the depth and area of the routed parts as shallow and small as possible to maintain the strength. If you're routing just wire slots, then once the wires are in, fill the rest with resin. For larger areas, you probably want to use some glass/cf to reinforce it.

My preference is West System Marine Epoxy.

You use the resin and hardner?

Resin doesn't work without a hardener. Epoxy, polyester, whatever, they all need a hardener.
