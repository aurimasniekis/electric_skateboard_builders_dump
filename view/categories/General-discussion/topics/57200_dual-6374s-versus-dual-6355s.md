Hello everyone,
I am still in the design phase of my board and I am faced with several questions:

1)Would the top speed of a dual drive with a 16:36 gearing ratio and 100mm wheels be any different for 6374 motors or 6355 motors?

2)They are both rated at 190kv so shouldn't the main difference between these two setups simply be the torque output and acceleration?

A few things to keep in mind:
1) I am lightweight at 150lb
2) I won't be hill climbing in Florida
3) I am planning to run my motors with a 12s4p power supply
4)I need the top speed to be at least 40mph
```

i didnt see a huge difference between 6355 and 6374 on 10s but the 74 def had way better brakes and more torque throughout the entire powerband if you are light weight and not experienced id suggest the 6355 option

Oh I plan on using 12s. I have some downhill experience and need the board to be able to reach 40mph.

Both the 6374 motor and the 6355 motor share the same kv rating so the calculator suggests they will reach the same top speed.

Right one gets there faster. And at the top doesn't loose torque resulting in a couple less mph..
```

## \#8 Posted by: ryanflick Posted at: 2018-05-30T02:03:46.219Z Reads: 382

So 6374's will get there faster and maintain a higher level of torque than 6355's?

## \#10 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2018-05-30T02:07:50.924Z Reads: 372

```
Essentially what happens is the 6374 and 6355 do have the same kv and so theoretically both have the same top speed and acceleration/torque.

The difference comes in when you factor-in heat.  The smaller 6355 gets hot faster, and hot windings have a higher resistance, which burns off even more power as heat, which increases the resistance and makes them even hotter...  The bigger 6374 will stay a bit cooler.  At low usage levels there shouldn't be much of a difference for same-specced motors until you start getting them hot.  Same for 5065 really, they're just even smaller.

From what I've seen and experienced, a single 5065 is meh. Single 6355 is ok.  Dual 5065 is good. A single 6374 is good. Dual 6355s are great. Dual 6374s are STUPID-great.

:arrow_up: same.  Single 5065 will get you to where you need to go, even if you're fat like me.  It won't be much fun though.  Dual 6374 is like stupid-powerful.

My preference, least to most preferred:
single 5065
single 6355
single 6374
dual 5065
dual 6355
dual 6374

So you can see I like dual 5065 better than single 6374.

they come with spacers that go on the axel before the wheel, and then you put your wheel on with its own spacers...or in your case just your bearings. mine came with 4 spacers and 8 washers...on each axel i went in this order...washer>spacer>washer>wheel assembly (with washers and spacers )

I have dual 6374 on 12s4p.  I'm 6'4 and weight 190lbs.  I'm also from the dh world and used to going 40+.  Going that fast on an esk8 is another ball game.  You feel like you're going so much faster.  I don't think I need dual 6374, but it's nice going up any hill at fast speeds.  Unfortunately, you'll have to run the 218 trucks to fit dual 6374.  They aren't bad, but the turning radius is definitely decreased.  Stability is good, but I think with better bushings, it could be improved.

Thanks for the feedback dude. I hope you won't mind a few more questions.

How fast have you been able to get your dual 6374 setup to go?

Can you still make a U-turn on a side streetwith the 218's? :joy:

Have you tried Orangutan nipples? I've heard good things about them.

Yeah, changing the bushings might help a lot. Have you tried Orangutan nipples?
At what speed with the stock bushings do you notice a loss of stability?

there is no complete loss of stability; but unless you're extremely careful around 42km/h+ you will feel it wanting to wabble. i run them quite tight and haven't had any major issues as of yet.  I havent tried any different bushings on these trucks (even my calibers had stock bushings), but they are definitely on my to-do list.

I've been just over 30mph with plenty of throttle left.  It's completely different than using gravity for the speed.  If you let off the throttle too fast, you'll feel like you're going to fall.  I can still make a full turn on a regular street, but barely.  I do rock my trucks pretty tight though..  I have not tried Orangatang nipples (I chuckled a bit typing that).

[/quote]

You can let off the throttle and coast, but if you let off too fast after accelerating, it'll give you a jolt.  If you aren't prepared for this, you could lose your balance.  I'm using the nano remote from diyelectricskateboards.  If you use the @Ackmaniac firmware, you can adjust the throttle curve so that it isn't as "touchy".  I've gotten use to the throttle at this point and don't see the need to install new firmware and do more setting changes.  Riding an electric skateboard that has dual 6374's definitely takes some getting used to, but I love it and wouldn't change a thing.

```
It’s not even the temperature, as it is more of a consequence of having less iron in the stator

With the bigger motor you have a longer stator, so you can push more current without reaching saturation in some portions of the material, with increasing current more and more parts of the geometry become saturated, the magnetic flux is at its limit,  the energy has to go somewhere, and it’s converted to heat

If you reach saturation in all the stator, you can increase the current all you want, the only thing that’s going to happen is to cook your motor and gain no additional torque

That’s the advantage of bigger motors, you have more room to play

[/quote]

Depends on how hard you are accelerating. Going from something pushing you forward that you are pressing against. And letting go of the throttle quickly, your body continues moving forward, and the board slows because of friction.

It's not necessarily a result of speed, but a result of 
Your motor max and battery max (how much power your board can accelerate with)
And how quickly your transition of the throttle is.

As I stated in the earlier post. Gear up man. It's alot different then gravity.

As far as speed, I've taken my Evo on 218s upto 47mph with gravity and 43mph on flats. Stock bushings are a no go for me, they have no rebound.

You may be able to see what I mean here, as far as leaning into the acceleration. Although I'm quite used to letting off the throttle so I don't feel the instability

Understood. If you are cruising at a constant speed and then let off the throttle, there shouldn't be jolt because you will simply begin to slow down?

Why the nano from diyelectricskateboards instead of the mini?

@Deckoz stated it well by saying "Going from something pushing you forward that you are pressing against. And letting go of the throttle quickly, your body continues moving forward, and the board slows because of friction."

If you let off the acceleration gradually and adjust your lean, you'll be fine.  When something pushes you from the feet, you need to lean forward to avoid it flying out from under you.  If you are leaning because of fast acceleration and you suddenly let off the accelerator, you're going to feel like you will fall (depending on speed and amount of lean).  

As far as why the nano, I just picked one.  I didn't have any reasoning for choosing the nano vs the mini.  I haven't had any issues with the nano and it is tiny enough that it isn't obvious I'm holding a controller.

Im kinda in the same boat as @Battosaii 

It also makes it so riding doesn't feel any different when the battery is almost dead... You can still acquire street speeds. 

But as others have said 

Knees, elbows, hips, spine and roost. And my latest - tie up ankle braces to prevent rolls. 

I still go down hills with just a helmet and gloves and sometimes throw knees on. But Esk8 is a different beast. Be safe please.

Not a commuting board. When I finish my potato for the office campus it will just be a half cap and gloves and 20mph max. Just depends on how I'm riding :)

I think having a high performance esk8 is like owning a supercar. You have the ability to go fast but most of the time you'll simply cruise.

A little more ground clearance, less debris can get into your belts, less rocks will be hitting your motors and mounts, you can use a drop through deck, but no real performance difference. Some also prefer the look of the motors at the back.

Once more thing, I'm still trying to find a good deck to build my board.
I need it to be stiff and drop through for stability.
I would prefer a plain deck because I plan on a custom paint job.

One more thing, would you recommend or did you pre-chunk the 107's? Will it help lengthen the lifespan of the wheels?

You don't want your wheels chunked lol. Chunking = bad. @ryanflick 

I have had one of my wheels start to chunk, but I regularly super glue my cuts to keep them from chunking. Like below, the white is super glue

![1528669160909721730107|375x500](upload://xEwn5vz7vVROSCH9sJuUczYbWBl.jpg)

There are seval specs of white in this picture, as well as several new cuts that need glued. My first set, I didn't super glue regularly, and they chunked to the point of not ridable.

As far as breaking in, with regular street riding, it takes about 75 miles to skate off the outer layer for maximum grip, before that they are slippery as shit.

Thanks for the tip.
Check out this build:

He "pre-chunked" the wheels.
I'm not sure if that is good advice or not.

So have I... And many others. ;)

But mounting underneath on a drop through deck with the trucks dropped through and not top mounted is near impossible. Which is why you will see alot of top mount, or Top mount drop deck configs :slight_smile:

See(same deck as your post - Evo) on belt or gear drives, top mounted.

[quote="Deckoz, post:31, topic:57200"]
pends on how hard you are accelerating. Going from something pushing you forward that you are pressing against. And letting go of the throttle quickly, your body continues moving forward, and the board slows because of friction.

It’s not necessarily a result of speed, but a result of
Your motor max and battery max (how much power your board can accelerate with)
And how quickly your transition of the throttle is.
[/quote]


And that friction is partly a result of how loose or tight you keep your belts and all the things that increase drag.. 

With a bit tighter belt tension, letting go of the throttle nearly threw me off at first. Having belts looser made me almost not feel any slow-down-kick when letting go of the throttle..

Metroboard offers a "college student discount" which gives you $50 off the pricing "above". "Pricing above" is $30 for their pulleys. lol

I kinda like that deal.

This was my first build, and I was just really impatient to ride.  Pre-chunking the wheels worked fine, though as mentioned on the thread a lathe will do the job much better.  Since then I used a machine to shave them down and they work wonderfully.  Though slightly triggers me that I didn't wait and do it properly.  Meh.  Feels like a rough draft.

Also 12mm belts slip a ton unfortunately, at least while braking.  The torque burned off the teeth on one of the belts that I have.  Definitely get 20mm belts.  

I've got the Metroboards pulleys on my list that I'll order with parts for my next build / modifications for current build. And an @Eboosted enclosure for my evo. 

Loved the aesthetics of @Deckoz evo. Thinking I'd like to grab the 36" falcon version of the evo, build my own battery / mold enclosure.  Going to try to build something that will allow me to swap batteries out easily.  Perhaps slide rails of sorts.

[/quote]

What the hell are y'all talking about?

As far as me, and what I think @b264 sarcastically said was that it looked like your wheels were chunked before the build, and you tried to smooth them out.

Please no one actually chunk your wheels on purpose, you loose contact patch and there is no point. That I can see. I really have no idea what if anything you we're trying to achieve...

I don't know if anyone has suggested this, but stock bushings on 218 are meh... I got speed wobbles on a single 6374 running at 10s5p... I swapped my bushings and split (wedged and de-wedged) my trucks and it's soooooo much more stable now, I can feel wobbles when I start to get to 25mph ish, but they quickly stop (I attribute that to my bushings as they are WFB from riptide, also for perspective I'm 215lbs and run a 93a and 95.5a ones a chubby the other is a fat cone)

I can turn great now and overall a solid build

Pre-build I had it suggested that in order to put 107mm wheels on the TB mounts to shave the wheels.  So i used a goddamn razor blade and shaved off the edges.  

You commented on my build post at the time, I actually thought you were endorsing it.  I was looking at your evo build today and noticed you did not do that.  

Lmao.  It worked.  About 3mm of contact patch lost.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

But yes.  Don't do that

Are you running your chubby (eliminator/stim) bushing roadside and your cone boardside?

Normally the chubby is run boardside so the extra meat carries your weight, unless you are using it to limit wheelbite?

You might find it more stable the other way around?

For the sake of argument... But not specifically chunking (that sounds like a retarded move... *Whyyy?*) .... It does make sense to shave down the edges of your wheels depending on the feel you are going for. 

Rounding out hard edges for more predictable release in drifts for example. Remember the old blue kryptos? Those had like a 35mm contact, fairly round edges, offset core, and would break free / drift amazingly. Reflex is it's own beast and doesn't drift well... But I'd be interested to hear from someone who may have shaped their superflys to have smaller contact / rounded edges just for curiosities sake. 

As above, narrowing your contact patch as well for better drifts...

And also, pre-worn contact patches for 0 break in.... The wheels just drift the best they will.

I guess this all means better drifting/sliding, but also you get the most predictable grip with pre-worn / worn in wheels. All somewhat related to *chunking your wheels on purpose...**???*** lol.

Good luck drifting with broken in 107s, they are sticky as shit. I mean I guess if you had a carve board, but why ruin $150 set of wheels for this? Use some slippery  83,90 or 97mm clones.

The benefit of the contact patch is to make sure you don't slip with power like my board for example. Dual 6374 can spin/burnout pretty easy. But I'm not going drifting with 107s...save it for the $20 flywheel clones

I definitely didn't buy them for slides, though @Deckoz someone could make a case for wanting to roll over bumps but also be able to slide.  There are better ways, but hey it's DIY / personal preference right?  IE Kegels are sticky but I like how they slide on rougher pavement

Fortunately machining them down was fine.  Lost about 3-4mm of contact patch, but got a great deal on the wheels at $110 anyways.  Rides great. 

This was a first foray into soldering / electrical / mechanical anything and that was really the only fuckup in the build.  (maybe besides not getting the 20mm metroboard wheel hub / belts) so pretty pleased overall.

TLDR best way is don't shave your wheels.  Get the correct hardware / wheels for what you want.

I'm really comfortable at about 30-35mph, and falling at those speeds.  Tumbling is a fun thing to practice / if you have a parkour group in your area, it's a valuable thing to know how to do.  As well as the feel of just how to slide out on your feet / hands.

Personally I worry much more about cars / road conditions.
