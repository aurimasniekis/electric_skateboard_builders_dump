Thanks for your quick answer. Would you have an idea where I could buy for the smallest price in Canada along with a charger? I'm looking to reviving an old 600w maverix board but all I have left from it is the board, motor and original charger

Unfortunately there are no good retailers of lithium ion batteries in Canada, I'm in Montreal and I like to get them from nkon.nl, but it takes between 2 and 4 weeks to get here. I also ordered from the US once but ended paying more because of the brokerage fees...

Just email him, Arjan offers soldering 18650 cells, just describe him the configuration you want, a little drawing may help aswell.

I do have the experience but I don't have much time :) 
There are a bunch of guys in Montreal that might be able to help you, they might even have a built battery for sale, check out this Facebook group:
