Not esk8 related but don’t know where else to ask :joy:
Looking at getting some micro nfc tags from Adafruit but shipping to the uk is £33, anyone willing to buy then then ship them over to me? They would fit in small envelope, not sure where they got £33 from but I would really appreciate it if someone could help me out.
Thanks!
