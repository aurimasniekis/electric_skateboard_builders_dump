Hey,

I was wondering if anyone ever dyed some orangatang wheels. Ive searched a lot about dyeing wheels and the best dye is "RIT". Many people have used it. I am now in the process of dying my wheels and the dye doesn't seem to affect the wheels. Its been about 45 mins since i started. Do i need to wait longer? the colour hasn't seemed to change

How are you doing it ?  Did you bring water to a simmer and then add RIT dye (appropriate proportion to water), mix dye for a minute, and then add your wheels to water ?  I recently did a set or FLY Wheels using this method and they turned out ok but i had to soak them over night.  My wheels were Abec 11 97mm 75a.  What's the specs on yours ?

yeah, thats the method i used, i have purple 80mm orangatang kegels 83a. Ive taken them out now. they've gone darker purple but no way near black

Could go longer to get a nice deep black.  The longer you soak them the better the color will get.

Those look pretty sweet.  I used RIT powdered black dye.  I don't know about adding salt or vinegar to the dye water.  From the research i did, i saw people almost boiling water, adding dye (powder or liquid RIT dye), stirring for about a minute and then adding wheels for various amounts of time to achieve the color they were looking for.  I had success with this method but i had to soak my old fly wheels overnight, they are pretty black now but beat up as they were a set i had used for a year already (didn't want to sacrifice a new set in case dyeing ruined them).  I think having the water heated for the duration you have the wheels in the water might make a difference (like speed up the time it takes to get the color you want).  Just a theory though and i have no good way of proving it.  Where did you hear about the salt and vinegar thing ?

i had the stove on the whole time the wheel was in the water and i stirred every 2-5 mins until i took them out. Ive read various forums and pages saying that people have put in salt or vinegar to make it more concentrated.

Also the description for the dye..

"For more intense color when dyeing fabrics containing cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen, add 1 cup salt to the dyebath. When dyeing nylon, silk and wool, add 1 cup white vinegar to the dyebath. If possible delay adding the salt or vinegar until 5 minutes after the fabric has been in the dye bath. The delay will help to promote level dyeing.
Add 1 Tablespoon laundry detergent to all dye baths to help promote level dyeing."

I'm afraid of what the salt and vinegar might do to the wheels materials.  But if you're saying that other folks have had success it might be worth a shot.  They dye is so inexpensive too.  I don't have pics with me, I'll try and take some later tonight or tomorrow.  Mine were old so while they are pretty black they don't look great as they are pretty beat up from use.  I'll post them later though, so you can see.

yeah i read this before doing the process, i just think orangatangs have a higher durometer so may trek even longer to dye. I just think it would suck if each wheel will take around 2 hours ish. Im probably going to play with different ways of dying. I read that turning off the stove and then blasting it for a minute can help. I may even add a whole bottle next time or mix the bottle and powder.

Do you know which is stronger? liquid or powder. i think I'm going to try powder on another wheel

The liquid i believe is more concentrate than the Powder.  I believe on RIT's site they say "one bottle of Rit liquid dye is equivalent to two boxes of Rit powder dye".  Liquid is the way to go I guess.

I also used Ritt dye (powder form), i also dyed the urethane from Hummie's hubmotors and they ended up completely black after 10min or so. The kegels don't seem to soak up the dye that well unfortunately. I stopped trying, and will probably just buy some black Evolve G.T. wheels if the kegels ever wear-out.

@themegak  last night i decided to give them another attempt. i left them in the pot for around 3 hours, playing around with the heat and always stirring. I got the to a very dark purple so i decided to leave them overnight. When i checked them this morning they turned out very very dark drown, almost black i am pretty happy with the result and this was using half a bottle of dye at a time and i added salt on the second attempt. On my next wheels i will use a full bottle and a salt and see how they go. i may also leave them over night.

Its more into doing it over and over instead of very harsh in one go. It takes a very long time for the dye to penetrate. Ofc the more concentrated the faster it reaches inside, but you also want to do it over and over so they all are uniformed.

When they reach about dark brown, once it hit the aspath, it will turn greyish to black. So thats not that bad afterall.

Now that the wheel has dried off, I think the dye has set it because it is now black.

I have now removed the graphic, but it is still very faint in purple underneath where the graphic was as the dye most of not reached it. This isn't a big problem as I can just dye this section and it shouldn't take too long.

I have removed the graphics on the other wheels too. **if you guys are going to dye your wheels and don't want the graphics in the final product, remove the graphic before dyeing**

it depends on the wheels, on softer/cheeper wheels i would say all the way through but on tougher wheels such as orangatang kegels i would say around a few mm. This is just a prediction. I dyed the wheel then removed the decal and under the decal it was still very very dark so i would say it penetrates quite a few mm.

Ive tested (grind test) the dye of 3 hours at almost boiling point (I think boiling point) with kegel clone 90mm Rit dye black powder it coats it around 3 - 4mm. 4mm already having in between shades.

I guess kegel is abit softer so the dye penetrates better with the liquid Rit Dye. I would like to try this too.

The clone have tougher material and bounce higher. I think it has something to do with the durometer as well. But anyway 4 - 5mm give you full solid color if the dye manage to penetrate well. Nevertheless it's really good enough for urethane as they wont wear out almost ever (unless you slide alot).

Below are the beat up Fly Wheels i Dyed.  I also dyed a bunch of bushings which turned out great.  I only heated the water once in the beginning using powder RIT dye and just soaked them for like 12 hours or so.  I'm sure they would look a lot nicer if they were new Fly Wheels but it was basically a proof of concept for me.  Also i can probably get the center ring darker if i soaked longer i suppose but I'm probably going to use the liquid dye next time with heat and salt (thanks for the info).

yea, I'm also going to experiment using food buffet trays and heaters in my garage or backyard so i don't have to use my stove and don't have to worry about dye splashing around so much.  Also mostly to please my wife and stay out of her kitchen.  Below is what i am talking about, this can give us the option to use heat perpetually or take it away when we want while not having to worry about messing up our kitchens.  I basically dumped almost boiling water into these type of trays (6 for $ 3 at the dollar store) for my fly wheels and let them soak.   Next time I'm going to use the heating element as well to give myself heating options as well.  Cleanup will be a lot easier too.  By the way what did you use @Raf ?

thats a great idea. i just used a pan on a stove. i made a hook out of a hanger so the wheel could float in the pot. this allowed me to keep on the heat without worrying about the wheel being in direct contact with it.

I don't think you can go lighter with dyes, only darker. Maybe with hydrogen peroxide? Ok, that's probably a bad idea. 

@themegak @Raf I think using a sous vide immersion circulator (anova is the best band imo) would be ideal for the long cook times and temperature control needed. Put the wheels & dye in a ziploc bag inside a pot and set the sous vide to maintain a consistent temp near boiling for as long as you want. I've used my sous vide to cook over days at a time. mmm, 72 hour short ribs...

That might be the best heating element for this purpose but unfortunately i can't justify the cost.  i could buy a nice carbon hi5ber deck for that cost.  You know my wife may already own one of those, i should ask her but i highly doubt she would let me use it for the cause.  Thanks for the info though I will keep a look out for one on the cheap on ebay.

i would totally dye bushings because i don't believe aesthetics should have to suffer over specs like durometer.  If somebody wants an all black board with 92a bushings i shouldn't only have the option of some bright primary color determined completely by the brand producing them.

Oh, that sous vide pays for itself since you can make amazing meals out of cheaper cuts off meat like pork shoulder, turkey and chuck roast that you'd normally have to cook all day in the oven.

```
Bushing durometer and formula are critical to how your trucks perform, both of which are masked when you dye them.  All of my boards use at least 2 different durometer bushings, while my asymmetrical setups typically have 4.  It's hard enough to keep them straight when they are color-coded.

Most people ride stock bushings and just crank them down.  But you can make your board feel so much better if you spend time tweaking it.  I realize you design custom boards for people, and they may want to follow a certain color scheme.  If you're already dying their wheels, sure, throw their bushings in there too.  I just fail to see how something the aesthetics of something so small (and largely hidden from view) can be more important than the board's performance.

not a big deal at all you can always engrave the duro on the bushings or mark it in some way  Being able to color match is way too pleasing to me so i had to do it.  Imagine having an all black build and yellow bushings spoiling everything.  I know it sounds nit picky but it makes a big difference aesthetically.

how exactly does dye impact the durometer of a bushing? 

Also, those color codes are not standard across brands. Often not even within the brand across cones, barrels, and kegs. Riptide has a yellow bushing that's 88a and another yellow bushing that's 90a. Seismic has a clear blue one at 90a, Riot has yellow ones that are 80a, Khiro has a yellow 92a, etc etc, and Venom has a yellow 83a as well as a yellow 85a. 

It's totally arbitray and noone is following any sort of color standard.

It doesn't..,. Until you drop them on the floor and can't tell which is which

While it is all rider preference, a well tuned board typically does not use the same duro all around.  I'm just advocating experimenting with different bushing combinations to suit your style.  Dying them all the same color discourages this

I think the solution is just writing the durometer on the butt or head of bushing where it won't be visible once installed.

Wouldn't be hard to mask a small part of the bushing to retain its original color for identification.

I think others have used hot glue mask to make patterns.

Sorry i forgot about posting my pics/results, but here they are now. The wheels i tried dyeing are @Hummie  urethane wheels from one of his early batches (quick healing stuff i believe) and a pair of Orangatang Kegels.

I used Rit Dye in powder form, only because the liquid stuff was unavailable at the shop i got it from (i originally wanted to get them both, so i could try both forms). I used some leftover chopsticks from a takeout meal i ate and stuffed the tapered ends in the holes of the kegels so that it wouldn't touch the bottom of the hot pan.

I just used a big old pot i had and boiled up enough water to be able to submerge the whole wheels. I lowered the heat so that it was just below boiling temperature and put in the wheels. I thought i would have to throw out the pan after using the dye, but it came out completely clean afterwards.

Unfortunately i don't have any pics of the boiling proces, i guess i was scared getting dye all over my kitchen, lol. So here are the results, i took out Hummie's wheels out after about a 20 minute swim because they where already perfectly black, the Kegels didn't seem to pick up the dye at all, so i let them sit in the pot for twelve hours or so and the result is what you see on the pictures. I also removed the stickers/paint from the kegels using some fine sandpaper as shown on one of the wheels here.

The funny thing is, if i would not have dye'd hummies wheels, the kegels would now be the same tint of orange.

I tried dyeing the Kegels once more after this because i had another packet of Ritt, but twelve hours later it only darkened them a little more. So getting them completely black this way would take about a week or so i guess :smile:

I guess its better to get the purple kegel with liquid rit dye to get the perfect black kegel wheels.

[quote="HTownBomber, post:51, topic:8246"]
I think using a sous vide immersion circulator (anova is the best band imo) would be ideal for the long cook times and temperature control needed. Put the wheels & dye in a ziploc bag inside a pot and set the sous vide to maintain a consistent temp near boiling for as long as you want.

F*@$ING GENIUS!  i have the Anova (Mmmm... steak!) and it works great.  Going to try this for sure now.

was there any luck dying the orange kegels black?

liquid dye and salt. a full bottle and heat it for around 3-7 hours making sure you don't boil it or put the wheels in direct contact if the heat. Then you can turn off stove and leave overnight. should do the job. Orange kegels i think have a higher durometer so may be harder

it should work, just a lot of time. i find using one full bottle of it dye and salt works. you can either keep the heat on the whole time but make sure it doesn't boil and the wheels don't touch the bottom of the pan. Or you can use the blast method i used above.

I think what really helps is the salt and leaving it overnight. IF its still not the colour you want try heating again till it is.

I don't think it will affect the durometer. i have read online dyeing wheels doesn't affect the durometer, but the heat may. Orangatang kegels are very strong and can withstand a lot of heat so you should be okay as long as you don't boil the water. Just keep it hot enough before boiling set the heat to a low temp or off

## \#75 Posted by: Raf Posted at: 2016-09-15T17:37:25.819Z Reads: 220

```
you just use roughly around 1 cup per 3 gallons of water and one full bottle. (thats what it says on the site for clothes)

Im not sure how much water is in the pan, i would say roughly 1 litre - 2. i added around 3 tablespoons of salt and made sure to dissolve it for 10 minutes. you want to make sure all the salt is gone so it won't scratch the wheels and damage them.

I still have the other wheels to dye so next time i do it. I will follow the formula above and divide the measurements accordingly. I will still use one full bottle though as it will make it stronger.

This may be a little overkill but if someone is doing this regularly a wonderbag is a great way to maintain heat while not subjecting the wheels to direct heat:

Cheaper than any sous vide options and it stays hot for very long time. I slow cook things overnight in mine all the time and it's still too hot to eat in the morning.

It's bulky, but it's filled with foam so you can really pack it down. When I don't use it I just roll it up and put it in a large soup pot in my cabinet. I usually use a 7 qt dutch oven and there's room to spare.

Raf and I had success using ordinary Pots.  If you follow our methods, you should also have success at only the cost of Heat, Salt, Liquid Dye (powder works too but you need more time), Big pot or disposable $ 1 store pans, stir and patience.  I was surprised how well it worked on my Fly Wheels and bushings, and Raf's kegels look great.  I do like the wonderbag and sous vide methods but you don't need them to get a nicely dyed wheel.  Try it, it's great getting the color you want out of the wheels and bushings you like best.

So i decided to give this process a try with my abec 11's. I have a 90mm set and a 97mm set which i used black and dark blue accordingly (though the blue looks black in the end). I failed the first try using standard RIT dye, found out it simply has to be polyester specific dye, so i used dylon synthetic from the craft store. Mix the dye components in a large pot and brought to a boil while stirring. Removed the pot from heat source and let sit a minute. Then i placed in 4 wheels and closed the lid for 45 minutes. Clean the wheels after with soap water and finish with an isopropyl wipe. I am happy with the results, especially in light of the new evolve 107mm black wheel 😈<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/4/a40442e8b62fd2615bfbd68cd4cfb3d0470b3fbd.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/d/ada8ac4df0117afa2e6406f2fb89a7a179981600.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/6/d6a8316b20a92bd3f9e7460f004786a36f55d03e.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/e/0e05d2342da09aeff1824671b41c6dc747875e46.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/f/ff8c189d500af7b6b125c0dc74a12d910fa397eb.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/d/2d7d04096658a56552d66f7817f4f790db524f0b.jpg" width="690" height="388">
