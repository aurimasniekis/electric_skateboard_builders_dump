What would you get?

I'd most likely get the same deck I have (a fresh new one) and some dual carvon Evo motors. I actually like the slim battery pack I have now so I'd keep that. I'd put those big skate wheels I've been trying to fit on mine and get either @longhairedboy or @psychotiller to make it all nice and pretty. Split carbon fiber enclosures with the cables nicely hidden. I'd have a built in handle in the deck. Lights that work with the remote, but I like how my remote feels in hand so it would be cool if I could make it work with the same one. I'd have purple neon under the deck, bright headlights and tail lights. Of course all my random stickers underneath because it's a skateboard... 

I geuss I'd get 2 focboxes, although I haven't had any issues with these rock solid parts that were gifted to me. Maybe some type of horn built into the remote, although I don't know what would alert a driver that's not paying attention.

Last but not least, I would finish it all off with the greatest griptape that anyone has ever seen. It will be 1 that doesn't care about color, but instead puts them together like, like a rainbow. And nice cuddly animals like ponies and... A panda! And it would be the most peaceful, happy board out there. Believe it or not, that pony griptape boosts more attributes than you think.

I would buy a couple hundred Carvon EVOs, sell them all, buy Enertion off of Jason, with that money, buy a few hundred Baja boards, resell them, expand my business, become a global esk8 conglomerate, start up a dedicated US esk8 factory, hire a couple thousand workers, then have a few big-name rappers market my board, become a household name, and therefore, own the market.




Im strictly business here ;)

I'm drooling over @treenutter's boards.

Damn.  A gloss black bludgeon with channels routed out of the bottom to accommodate 12 of @kaly's 4p PCB's loaded with 30Q's, all tied together with some VESC6 derivative hardware and a DieBie BMS.  A slim @bigben enclosure to hide it all.

Some Carvon's with ABEC 107's and I'm set.

Let's not forget the @mastercho GT2B remote.

Dead sexy and clean AF.

10s3p battery pack, antispark switch Loaded Vanguard Jessup griptape griptape + some other for that 2 tone design.

My board will be a foldable board with integrated battery holder(12s6p 21700 / as much as possible) and with handle in between the hinge
Also carvon exo with suspension baseplate
At wheels that has internal gearbox for carvon exo
Vesc7s if that ever comes out

The board I'm building now is half way there😂

Oh and why not turn frictional stuff into real life, like actual hoverboards, flying cars, dark matter drive, or gn drives haha

all boards sound fantastic, but what happens when you blow em up like your affordable board you already have and now have to find someone to fix it if you are unable.  Which might mean sending it off somewhere.  Id trade all my boards in for a Local E-Board Wizard shop... cause lets face it... we MAX everything out; power, stereo volumes, spaces, money.etc.

If I had unlimited money in electric skateboard ? I'd build & run a shop tailored to offer the following services : 

- A to Z quick guidance to build your skateboard depending on your needs - carver, cruiser, stunt, Speedy Gonzalez or custom - (with matching parts list assistance)
- Wide choice of parts from reputable brands for each needs                                     
- Proper choice of plug n play or easy to assembly motors / ESC + receiver combos / batteries to match it all (I love modular designs & it must also be reliable performance)
- Get responsible people to stress test all of it like they hit their last ride before it comes to the streets.
- Bundle a bar / restaurant with the workshop so anybody can come, meet the team & build stuff or simply relax & enjoy what's being worked on. 
- Make it to an easy location so it's logical to come without a vehicle and leave on a skateboard.

In short, it must be as easy as "ok I enter a shop and walk out later with a board tailored for **me**" or "I just wanna spend a great time and relax in this place". Kinda like some motorcycle workshops. This includes a lot of ideas and hiring a squad too but too many things to write down. And for non-locals, convey the shop experience through an eShop.

Wanna help fund a brotha? :beers:

Unlimited money... top of line Tesla model S.

Butttt more realistically if Etherium hits 3k by the end of the year I’m going to build my dream board :heart_eyes:

A sexy TRAMPA mountainboard inspired by @Nowind 

12s 10p 30q batteries (1.3KW)
4WD with 2 Vesc 6’s in the back powering sensored alien power 80100 motors. 65 batt amps 100 motor amps
Front wheels will be powered by 2 focboxes and Sk3 6374 motors 25 batt amps and 80 at the motors. 
Holypro 35 deck with 9inch superstar wheels, vertigo trucks and a nice helmet so I don’t die on mountain bike trails.

If I had unlimited money to buy a board, I would instruct Tesla to temporarily discontinue the automotive business and devote the entire company's staff to building me a lithium-ion battery-deck that weighs 5lbs and has 2000Wh of energy storage at 36V (for 5,000 cycles) then I'd let @longhairedboy  and @psychotiller play rochambeau  for the chance to build an unlimited-budget build with the deck-battery.  Because I'd be too busy with girls and blow to build it.

I mean putting some braking soles under your shoes + seismic/vicious grip would make it usable. But there is just nothing to dog into for turns, leans, or god forbid any slides or speed checks. 

But yeah sexy one.

But just so you know, you can add your own concave rather easy.

Ghetto method with griptape layer in a relief manner, or buy 3d implants for your desires.

I thought about buying it anyways and trying to sand out a tub concave but that's a risk and a lot of work, still considering.

Longboard decks made out of multiple stripes of Oak, Maple, Cherry, Mahogany, Bubinga and Teak. They used to made these hand crafted longboards reminiscent of old school California surf boards.

Yeah, so sad. This :point_down: is one of the decks, the 42" inch 'Wooden Eddie' I was considering for my first built after I found Tim Cindrich's 'Silverfish' was also gone forever. No deck was similar to other because the difference in the patterned stripes. Each were unique. However, decks were sold for $ 280, and completes with Randal trucks and Seismic wheels for about $ 380 dolores ....auuuchh!!
