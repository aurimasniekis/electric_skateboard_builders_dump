I just ordered a set of these direct from maytech with 200KV like a month ago for $118.35 each with like $35 shipping. $90 would've been sweet.

I think I might switch to the sealed 6374 for the lower kv, and more proven track record. Had anyone heard of any issues with those sealed motors? I think LaCroix uses them on their boards. The lack of details and testing is making me a little leery of the 6880s.

i been rocking sealed motor for coming up on 6mo no issue so far... 12s and runs quite cool... warm actually but never hot... 6355... i was testing the cheapo 6374s on ebay and they ran hotter actually (unsealed) running them the same on my similar routes

I think the advantages with this motor are a bit more. The specs are identical to the 6374 unsealed 190kv 
6880 is 190kv sealed with a bearing added at the rim- for more stable spin. 
I’m sure it helps with vibration and in my mind is a more stable design 
I think 8mm shafts are small. 
So at prices like these the advantages are apparent. 
90$ 6374 190kv
95$ 6374 sealed 170kv 
100$ 6880 sealed 190kv

hey guys, First time posting as im new to the whole DIY side of things, A friend of mine built me a board a while back and have been tinkering with that over the past few months.. 

Liking the sound of the 68's and am loving the sheer size of them :star_struck: but I need some help building around them.. 

Im going 10s, focbox unity and want to be running AT / 125mm gummies as London roads are a mess.. 

Any advice on trucks, motors mounts, pulleys? 

For my use I have no real need to go past 30 (but would be a nice option) and would rather a stiff almost drag style set up.. Nice and tourqey, lots of straight lines. 

Where this is pretty much at completion would really appreciate If any of you could share your setups for  these Big Bastard things..

@F.Taylor

Surfrodz are the way to go, but unfortunately importing from the US is the cheapest/best way to get them. I am in the UK so if you think you want to order some lmk

You guys are quick! Love how active these forums are :+1: 

Sounds like a plan, Im seeing these Surfrodz pop up in the forum a lot.. Where are you looking to purchase them from? Whats the current price?

Also any others that will "Do the job" if there isn't a good deal to be had over black Friday?


Im sure if I buy a cheaper set ill be able to use them on my next build... Probably shouldn't be planning it just jet thos -.-

I plan to purchase on Black Friday on their official website. Last time they were around $90 but I cannot be definite on what trucks will be on sale.

I think their regular price is good too so I would try and get them regardless if I were you.

Where I am from the roads were fine, but where I am now I can't imagine riding on these roads. Offroad wheels are good but you will need a bigger battery most of time

Maybe 97mm wheels for a little bit and maybe 85mm Seismic Speedvent wheels since nobody uses them.

hey guys, 
 we wanted to try and collect the funds without it costing everybody to do so.
It is an option we think may work better than paying friends and family or paying through the company account.
with my personal PayPal account, I can create a money pool that everyone can pay into and not be charged to do so.
everything we can save and use on shipping is a plus, and a few dollars less for you even better.
this group buy isn't like the majority of group buys (usually with some risk) we are not dealing with a company that is new or a product in a prototype stage.  The batch has started production (6880) and we will only be claming our number from that run, the 6374 sealed and unsealed are a stock item and will ship once ordered.

https://paypal.me/pools/c/89FJ1FbcPc

please email order confirmation and shipping address 
send your information to: groupbuy@hyperionsystems.org

Hi everybody - I know my account doesn't seem to have much logger in it, but I have probably 10days+ straight read time unlogged (dunno why I didn't take the 5 seconds to log in)

Anyways - I was planning on getting in on the 6374 order. However, I just now noticed the sealed is 170kv instead of 190kv. I for some reason read incorrectly and thought they were 190kv. Anyways - more torque may be better for me. I realize this probably isn't the proper place to ask this question, but at the same time, this thread is probably filled with a lot of people who know alot about beefier motors.

I'm embarking on my very first build somewhat soon, and I've never skated in my life, and won't be outside of electrically... Anyways, I live in a college town with some very steep 30% plus hills I'll regularly be going up. However, I so only weight 54kg ( but, hopefully after a surgery I'll be able to get back up to ~70kg ) , I'm also 5'6"ft. 

Anyways, the question I'm getting at - will 6374's be too much for me? Since I've found this forum... I've been under the impression they wouldn't be. But I really do have no baseline feel to go off of... Just what I read. Would 6355's truly be a better choice and I should just swallow my pride of having Big Beefy Motors™? 

Also, I'll definitely be riding through light rain/possibly puddles sometimes. Therefore why I was looking at the sealed motors. That is the correct line of thinking, yes?

Sorry for the long post in this thread, but I'd greatly q appreciate any input.

Get the beefy motors, if you go for 6355s you're going to ask for more with time anyways. The 6374s may be too much for you but you can always limit current in vesc settings

Yeah, that's the one thing that really kinda sucks. I think there's a 1kg difference BTW dual 6355 and 6374. 

Doesn't help that my shoulders are so fucked I'm literally having my top ribs surgically removed...

But shit, I ain't no bitch (maybe)

## \#60 Posted by: accrobrandon Posted at: 2018-11-19T14:07:44.196Z Reads: 117

I'm about the same size and height as u... I have 190kv 6355 maytech at 18/36 plenty of power torque.and speed at that ratio even at hills on 107s... With that said I'm.mainly buying the 6374 to see what noticable difference there is...apples to.apples with in the same brand. I say that because I bought a set of the cheap Chinese C6374s off eBay for fun. I didnt notice any major difference except maybe uphill was a hair smoother and they actually ran a hair hotter than my 6355s..... Possibly cuz theyre cheap...which is why I'm doing what I'm doing as mentioned... 
Dont worry your shoulder is gonna strengthen up real quick once u start carring around a dual drive lol....or so u hope ;)

Right now only the 6880 will be made WITHOUT the logo. 
The rest (6374 sealed and unsealed) will most likely be stock and have a logo already.  (unless we can get 20 or more on those) 
The price includes shipping ( EU guys I’m going to try and get everything for shipping for y’all with exception to your country’s taxes and import fees. 
I wish to get everything collected and the order submitted on the 22nd so we don’t have any new year delay. ( Chinese New Year they shut down for a month ) as long as we submit order at this time we will have no problems.

Yes, it’s new to everyone on this group buy. With all the pay by friends and family issues using business accounts. 
This way you are not charged to pay and we are not charged to receive. 
The emails will all be confirmed once payment is made. I can confirm I have your email but it needs to be to the groupbuy@hyperionsystems.org 

If you want 2 you pay in the amount for 2 into the pool, email your information to the email above 
Motor size
Amount 
Name and address 

Tonight and tomorrow I will be working on collecting everything and placing the order. 

Each email will be confirmed as payment is made and information is correct.

Sorry guys. 
Had a rough week. Someone brought the flu to thanksgiving dinner. 
We got the payment in on Monday as planned and they started getting the stock stuff ready for shipping Monday or Tuesday. USA arrival by the 8th
Stock motors are 
6374 sealed 
6374 unsealed 
The  6880 are on schedule for the first of January/ end of December if all goes well. 
NO LOGO on the 6880 motors 
Phase wire Leigh is 320mm 12 inch with 5.5 banana 
We didn’t get the 60ct need for that motor (6880)  for custom sensor wires.

I just got an update on the production of the 6880 motors. 
Projected day of competition and ready to ship by the 10th ( or before ) 
@PatRocks did you want specs on all the bearings used or just the rim bearing?

And for you EU guys, the stock motors are on the way. 
Once I have the 6880 ( not may for the EU) I will ship those as well. 
We will have a chance to include some of the new remotes and the new Maytech 6

She squeezed this in an email and I almost missed it. 
Dynamic braking module. 
I don’t see much use in a eSkate situation but I do believe it’s something used in electric motorcycles and small e -cars.

“Please check attached pictures for new VESC6 based controller, anti-spark switch, and Rheostatic Brake.”
 They just don’t volunteer anything.

nothing has changed on the specs, and if they go with the motor shipment, it would cost from Brussels to you

once I have specs on the brake and remote I will have it up for everyone to see.
Our goal is to get the new products in the hands of the esk8 community. The best product testing is done by the DIYers.
With that said, 
  We are the testers and must be safe doing this. We have always promoted safety. WEAR YOUR GEAR AT ALL TIMES because it will save your life. Be responsible with the family and friends who don't ride like us. 
We wish everyone a happy holiday and a safe time with friends and family.
Thank you guys for participating in the group buy.

I’m going to be working all the additional stuff we can add to the final shipment of 6880 motors from Maytech at the first of the year.
They have 3 new items of great interest.
R2 style remote
Mtesc6
Dynamic brake module

Flipsky has 3 new products
Nano clone remote
Nano remote with lcd screen ( telemetry)
High amp switch with push to start

I will try and put together some sample buys to get these products out in the community’s hands for real testing.

I would think they would be the same as the 6374 motors. 
The rim bearing is the new addition going to a bigger size can allows them to wind it at 190kv. 
That’s the big issue with sealed motors ( heat ) 
Size matters here boys.
