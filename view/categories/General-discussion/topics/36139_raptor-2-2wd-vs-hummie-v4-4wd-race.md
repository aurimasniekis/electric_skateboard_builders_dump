Hey guys, so for those of you who could not attend the Raptor 2 night ride event, here is the race between mojo and I.

I jumped the line a bit at first, let off the throttle, and went, so I had at most, a board length of extra room. But it didn't matter. I was far ahead within the first few seconds, and continued to pull away the entire block. By the time I looked back enough for the camera to see mojo, I had let off the throttle to let him catch up so we could chat about it.

With out further a due:

You should have let him get the go and then got the flyby on video! Good to see that board is performing as expected.

yea, I wish we had raced more honestly. tried differnt things, but it was expected considering they are 4wd. So hopefully, mojo can get a 4wd raptor going and we can have a fair race :)

Yes, I do too. Next time, we'll have a 2wd board setup up. This is far from the last time I'm sure I'll race @Moja  :)

I was hoping for the next performance day, but that hope's gone now. I'm worried without surgery, I might not get the strength I'll need from the ankle for the harsh riding that I do.
