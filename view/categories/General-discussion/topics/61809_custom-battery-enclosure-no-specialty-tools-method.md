So I am using a hummie deck as my platform, but this can be done with any deck.

So to start off let me say that you will be working with resin and fiberglass, you should wear an actual respirator (not a cheap dust cover), silicone based gloves, and a long sleeve shirt (trust me, it helps) also, work in a well ventilated area as fumes are strong and can make others nearby nauseous, dizzy, or high... and as always, please use common sense and don't do anything stupid.

No that the formalities are out of the way, you will  need several things to begin with, and it helps if you have them all when u start so ur not having to stop in the middle and what have you,  let's begin:

* fiberglass mat/cloth. This is up to you, I use the strand fiberglass as I've always been told it was stronger, but u can use the woven kind too as this really isn't super structural.

*Fiberglass Resin. This can be picked up at most big name hardware stores as well as auto body/auto parts store. I get mine from AutoZone personally because I get a discount, but the source really doesn't matter.

* Bondo. Same as above, this is used as the last step before you paint to smooth out the glass, since you're not using vacuum bagging you will most likely get air bubbles and need to level out ur case, however if u plan to use a flexi deck I would avoid this and take more time with the process early on.

* silicone based brushes, roller, and spreader. Silicone doesn't mix with the urethane so when it dries u can just peel it off and reuse the same tools (learned this after countless melted and hardened paint brushes.)

* duct tape. No explanation here...
* Cellophane
* C clamps (see pics for explaination)
* flexible/hard strips for clamping (see pics with C clamps.) these are for forming the lips which will screw to the deck to hold the enclosure to the deck.


I believe that's it but I will edit if I use more stuff.

So to begin you will need to figure out the tallest point your enclosure needs to cover. In my case it's the double stacked batteries.

![15315884489901541593231|666x500](upload://pAYXGLWNv33DPbfkT9c4rUW3N8R.jpg)


Now that we know the tallest point of the enclosure it's time to form the foundation for our case...

So we start by arranging the batteries (or other wise tallest objects in the enclosure) to form and distribute the height evenly, like so...

![15315886309701874201697|666x500](upload://qBtd5imgouYaXjVABe13W65p4y9.jpg)

![1531588661402136033351|666x500](upload://lTkSswRMjDLJxlBvLVpTOhsi0NQ.jpg)

Now we need to establish the base dimension for the enclosure... in my case I'm going for a tapered look to give the illusion of looking slimmer than it is so I will be using the same dimensions as the battery cutout...

![1531588908583781768680|666x500](upload://vBfSqmhsQDmvq824Wng98alB6qY.jpg)

![153158907546559233320|666x500](upload://i9eQOu5A9NgU3Gxths8FOWbR5wY.jpg)

![15315891184991483469137|666x500](upload://9y8vQ2IJoTb436DLyjVE1e3Roqi.jpg)

So from here you will use duct tape to shape the enclosure so TAKE YOUR TIME... this is one of the most important parts lol any uneven, flat, or warped area will show in the finished peice...

![received_10216484155640538|666x500](upload://f7FC7cXnhbnxVww7W7qpCzOXUfY.jpeg)

![20180711_180120|666x500](upload://jfAarn65U6PldjNCKx0xgZ55Cu7.jpg)

From here, when you're pleased with the shape of your enclosure you wrap it in several layers of overlapping cellophane, make sure there are no gaps and keep the cellophane as smooth as possible 

![20180713_142129|666x500](upload://jqSO3mvKG0IQWeR4vFawaZiPciO.jpg)

Now when you're sure there are no leaks (please ignore my sloppy wrapping haha I was in a hurry) u can begin the glassing process. To begin start by cutting ur fiberglass mat into small strips, then mix up some resin... make small batches as u can always mix more later... from there apply a thin coat of resin to the cellophane surface and start laying on the strips in an over-lapping fashion, ALWAYS overlap 

![20180713_152520|666x500](upload://3vclomWkoFfqF7ijN9p4J63GiQJ.jpg)
![20180713_152517|666x500](upload://mblbWyMVj6jYbeQI0o0TkJmMnL0.jpg)

Now keep doing this and be sure to leave some over hang so you can cut the enclosure to fit and account for any shrinkage..

Next comes those bars I was talking about. I just happened to have some 1/2" acrylic sheet laying around so I cut 2 strips off and that was that.

![20180713_153301|666x500](upload://7SHfI8C4WV4LcKAwJHJv21XFXJF.jpg)

From here I apply a 2 more layers and let it dry over night.

![20180714_114106|666x500](upload://tH1g9Z90tUvytmWrILTESy78aLU.jpg)

![20180714_114046|374x500](upload://d7YX3DGNRnsX6hR7EBpaf8gIGID.jpg)

I almost forgot now would be a good time to mention paints... if you want you can actually use pigments to dye the resin, or you can pick a rattle can of choice and paint as u would most anything else.

To be continued...

Reinforcing the mounting lip with 4 extra layers.

Keep in mind, when letting the fiberglass cure leave it on a level surface with the outside layer facing upward. Resins have a sort of wax in them that rises to the surface and helps it cure because of this you also must sand in between applications of layers.

His looks good... I have the stuff to make this properly (vacuum form) but I wanted to show the everyday diy'er you dont NEED that stuff to get the job done and still look good... just takes longer lol

However this is how I started making my fiberglass positives for my cosplay shop. Now I make 1, vac form it, and resin cast my props lol

The way I did it is wrap the board in packing tape.   Shape some pink insulation foam board. Spray the whole thing in spray adhesive. Stick on first fiberglass layer then add coat of epoxy and stick on second layer of fiberglass. Layer by layer. Then final layer of epoxy. Melt pink foam with acetone. Wet sand till desired. Paint/clear coat.

It's pretty much what I'm doin here he's just using foam core like @Titoxd10001 

And he's throwing CF over the top... my issue with CF enclosures is it's conductive and it makes a faradays cage... so if u use a CF enclose with hummies deck u run the risk of no signal

 I probably should have stuck to fiberglass. Only the last layer is carbon fiber. Tho I've never had signal issue while riding but do notice less range when I'm not near my board like +15ft. Hopefully thisguyhere doesn't have any issues with cf enclosure. I do run antenna outside enclosure. On a different board I used only fiberglass and dyed the epoxy black. Decided to keep the texture also

I was just at Harbor Freight and came across these.

![20180717_122949|374x500](upload://5CccJ2fY32UUy0dMD2j2AdztcoC.jpg)

I was just curious if these could be used just the same as these, which are much more expensive, but as far as I can tell, do the same thing..?

http://www.roarockit.com/tap-kits-and-bags/

Seems like the one from HF could do the same thing for a fraction of the cost.  Does anyone know about these kits and if they are essentially overpriced vacuum bags like the one I just found?

Oh that's good to know.  I was planning on using this just for a custom enclosure.  I figured I could make some molds that once the air is all out, I could press these molds over the bag, and they would press the edges and other odd shapes in to place better..

Yeah I was also considering making my own deck, either with one of these, or by building a press.  This would be the easier method of course, but I was concerned it wouldn't apply enough force as needed like you'd get from a press.  So you would say these are actually very good at making decks since they do apply a tremendous amount of force then?

@uigiroux u will destroy ur vacuum cleaner if u use those... you need a vacuum pump to get the right pressure and control it. You also need a resin trap between the vac bag and the pump so u don't kill the pump

😂 No! Using vacuum cleaner you won't destroy your vacuum cleaner!! No way! Ghetto vacuuming works fine! Because you use your vacuum cleaner only to suck air out of bag for seconds and a bit more to compress better so that resin a bit move out by the grooves  in the bag. You can clearly see how far resin travelled away from your fiber, it never get even close to valve on the bag. 😉 Of course if you leave vacuum cleaner non stop of all curing time, it will just blow up after few minutes 😆. 

As for not using vacuum at all, yeah! You can just use thinner cloth with multiple layers. Thinner Twill takes a lot better more complicated shapes and corners. I made mudguards on male molds without vacuuming at all! Shapes more complicated than enclosure.  I made first prototype from 10 layers 100g/m2 Twill Glass fiber, made just on one set all 10 layers. All sticked good to mold and corners, nice and smooth. 👍

Interesting thread. 
When pressing maple veneers over top of a one sided mold it is better to have a thicker vacuum bag than the materials used tor vacuuming composites like fiberglass and carbon fiber. My Roarockit kit was made specifically for pressing wood veneer and it does this very well. 

Pressing flexible carbon cloth the material is usually draped over as pre-existing shaped 3D form which requires little or no pressing power. In such you can get away with pulling much less of a vacuum. Around 7 pounds per square inch will do the job. This is what a fan driven home vacuum cleaner will pull. The trick in using a vacuum cleaner is making sure you have a bag that can be completely sealed and isolated from the vacuum source so that you can remove the vacuum cleaner once you have pulled a vacuum. 

Vacuum cleaners need to have air flowing over the motor to cool them. If you leave the vacuum connected to the bag the motor will heat and eventually burn out. 

I have made at least 20 carbon boards with great results using our kit. These all have been with maple veneer cores. It is important to know that the hand pump in our kit produces around 13.5 to 14 pounds per square inch of vacuum. This is more than enough for pressing skateboards or furniture components. 

Anytime I have done a pressing with a foam core I make sure I do not pull a full vacuum with our kit. If you are doing carbon cloth work with a foam core 13.5 pounds of pressure can crush and distort the foam core. Most surfboard or windsurf board makers only use 7 pounds of vacuum for this reason. Any more and the vacuum will ruin your project. With my projects, since I was putting carbon onto veneer I could use as much pressure as I wanted. This is an important distinction between foam core and solid core pressings that will make or break a project. The vacuum cleaner method will work but unfortunately not work well for pressing veneers over complex one sided molds..

Carbon work is usually done for two reasons. Strength and object lightness. Impregnating carbon without a vacuum bag will give you strength but not necessarily lightness. Too much epoxy = weight. A vacuum bag setup with peel ply and breather mesh where the excess epoxy is wicked away out of the carbon as it sets will produce strength and lightness. This can get expensive as you need a vacuum bag. carbon cloth. peel ply, breather mesh and epoxy to do the job properly.

I hope this is informative and helps to decipher a couple of methods of using vacuum bags.

Just made this one without vac. I used a paint brush to apply the resin, tomorrow, i will pop it out of the mold, giving it extra time to dry. After 3 hrs, it is very solid so far, hope it comes out good, 1st time making one out of fiberglass.

It is quite easy if done right. Mine got out ok, but to make things easier you should use fiberglass cloth not fiberglass mat. I used fiberglass mat and that is hard to get nice results. It does work, but it leaves you with a little disappointment.
