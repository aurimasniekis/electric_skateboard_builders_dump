good news! 
Finally got my side job up n running, will surely kick my board in gear :star_struck:

Now comes the questions, with money one the way it becomes time for me to make choices... and man do I suck at those :sweat_smile: So with this cry for help out of the way, I'd like to hear your guys two cents on all of this

A little side info about my soon to be build:
I have bought a few components here and there, slowly piecing together what is to be a mountainboard.

- Bought a trampa deck, not sure exactly which one it is but it looks like an hs11 with werid mounting holes, so I'll need to redrll those (got it from @mikedv thanks for that!) 
- Trampa infinity trucks, on their way to me too
- mbs five star hubs with their 9" tire + tube
- Unity Esc pre ordered, can't wait for that to arrive in the next... few months I guess :joy:
-TB 6356 motors (2x)

For the other parts I'm thinking of:

- @Idea mountainboards motor mount kit V (I really liked the idea of chains but this belt drive train just looks to good)  https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motor-mounts-kits-for-trampa-atb-and-mbs-matrix-old-type-matrix-ii-ats/44749

- Also his flexible battery enclosure or something else if these are sold out https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/enclosures-for-trampa-hs11-and-35-holypro/68260

- then batteries, here comes one of the two parts I don't really know yet. I have no problem building my own pack, and with those nice enclosures it'd be a shame not to go with 20700 class cells, but I'd have no idea which ones to choose :thinking: 
deconstructing a lipo  is also something I'm thinking about, but that would only be an option if I get a deal on some packs or something (been eyeing a second hand deal locally. 2 x 6s 10AH 25C-50C pack's that have only been run 8 times) 

- lastly comes the receiver, which I don't have a clue as to what to get

Hope you guys have some interesting notions about any of these parts or even some components lying around that they want to sell :sweat_smile:

Samsung 40T or ncr20700b.
Chains don't break like belts, could be run looser (I think), more torque transfer, can have smaller motor cog. @Andy87 please confirm
You can get  @Eboosted enclosure on BF sale
If you like trigger, get mini remote. Cheap and reliable. Or @MasterCho mod of GT2B
If you like thumb, nano remote, nano X, firefly, featherfly, maytech sextoy remote, all good

damn I always forget the price difference between 20700's and 18650's, well, in it for a penny, in it for a pound right? 

 since it's my first build I have no idea what I'd prefer in terms of remote but thx for the pointers :D

Why do you want 20700? 18650 are more energy dense and cheaper. 30Qs have great energy density and great power density. 20700 have similar power density but worse energy density and cost is ridiculous. 

LIPO is the way to go if you really want a ton of power though... Cheap and extremely power dense.

more about the possibility and the fact that those enclosures i was linking are designed for them. But yeah, seriously contemplating lipo's

Belts run smoother and more silent plus less weight and more range.
This said, I love my chains, I love the sound.
No belt slipping and instand torque.
I think itâ€™s the way to go for emtb if you donâ€™t want or donâ€™t have the money for a gear drive.

@Bokard you can use chains also with the mounts from @Idea 
Itâ€™s what iâ€˜m gonna do for my next build.
Depending on which version you choose you will just need a different size of cross bar. But that shouldnâ€™t be a big problem.
Even if I like the under board tray mount (and I have one of those you also want ðŸ˜‰) I donâ€™t use it at the moment. I have only 8â€œ wheels for now but I would be afraid crashing the battery tray while driving in the woods or so. Top mount is the way to go in this case. As min my opinion. I didnâ€™t liked the look before, but now iâ€˜m very happy with it. Easy to swap lipos too.
If you non the less want to go with under board tray and you need some covers for the holes in the deck sent me your e-mail as pm and I can sent you the stl Files

Thanks the input man! And we'll I want to go under board with the battery pack because of the fact that the board will mainly be used in the city, but the roads here are shit and I want to be able to go offroad too

Slow and steady wins the race! Trucks have just arrived and except for some scrapes on one of them and 2 missing spacers they look super nice! Paid 70â‚¬ shipping included for the pair locally so yeah!
