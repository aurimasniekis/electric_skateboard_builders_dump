Anyone done this with success? I have some old free decks from the original Meepo and WOWgo. I was thinking of cutting channels out of them with a router to give them more flex? similar to how guys tuck the wires but running them along the length of the board all across. Basically cutting out a few layers of material.

Figured I had nothing to lose... Used a 4" grinder and made a few cuts. From the side it looks like I only went 1 layer deep. It definitely softens it up. At the same time made it more "springy" which I don't really like. Need to put a few more miles on it and then I'll cut a layer deeper.
