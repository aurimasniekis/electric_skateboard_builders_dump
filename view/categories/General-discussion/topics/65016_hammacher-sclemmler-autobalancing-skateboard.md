Self balancing...cause it has 3 wheels? :thinking: :joy: Gotta admit their promo video was pretty entertaining. Terribly translated Chinese marketing material narrated in a perfect American voice. Groundbreaking.

Hammacher Schlemmer. Very German sounding, from Shenzhen.

The thing has an in-built Bluetooth speaker. Awesomeness.

Half of the Alibaba electric skateboard listings state that they are "self balancing". I presume they just copy pasta'd their hoverboard listings

that hilarious piece of junk aside, I've often thought 'auto-level when slamming on brakes' would be an ideal evolution for esk8.

I have a feeling that's the self-balancing mini hoverboard drivetrain in there, which may mean it is self-correcting before going into a death wobble? idk lol
