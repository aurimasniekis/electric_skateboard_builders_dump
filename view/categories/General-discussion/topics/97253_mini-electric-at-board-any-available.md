Hey guys I was wondering if anyone has ever seen a mini AT board with actual tyres available to buy "out of the box". I know I could build a custom one, but thought I'd see if there is any off the shelf first. 

If there isn't any can anyone recommend a good guild / forum post about someone whos made one? Ive trolled the forum and the web pretty deep before posting this! 

Cheers guys.
