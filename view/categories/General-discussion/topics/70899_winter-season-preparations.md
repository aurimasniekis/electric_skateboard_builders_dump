Hi guys,

Well woke up this morning to 37F and 22F windchill here is beautiful Minneapolis, MN and did my daily morning ride.  Damn it was cold and well it just is going to continue for the next 6 months. I had an open face standard skateboard helmet and a ski mask, should of had googles on as my eyes watered up pretty good.

I am interested in what people are wearing and find effective when Esk8 above the Mason Dixon line in the winter months.

Couple of items I need to upgrade:

1) Gloves - What are good options for gloves that will give warmth, grip and feel for the remote hand and some degree of protection?

2) Helmet- Thinking this is the year for full face helmet to provide greater safety factor and keep my head and face from freezing.  Looking at TSG and Vector?

3) Footwear - What footwear options are available that have the feel of vans and higher cut and will be warm?

4) Pants - I have used my snowboard pants in the past good warmth not a lot of protection (do wear knee and elbow pads).  Looking for fall protection and warmth.

The board is least of my concerns as I have studded all terrain 9‚Äù wheels that will work great on ice, slush and prob less than 4‚Äù of snow (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/ice-and-snow-diy-studded-tyres-tires-video-added/70765/2 Would appreciate suggestions on the 4 items listed above as well as addition gear that you may have found effective when riding in cold weather conditions.

For those of you that live in a location that think 50F is winter please be kind as we are all not that fortunate.

Winter preparations for a fair weather softie like me.

1. Put board in closet
2. Check storage voltages periodically 
3. gain weight on Christmas menus
4. Lose weight before summer

[/quote]

Vans make a winter hightop. Water resistant and lined to keep your feet warm. Work great for me in the PNW.
 
I like my full face TSG but at speed the air flow is cold.

For gloves i have thick slide gloves with the thumb cut off.

Sk8 hi MTE.
They're pretty warm but still feel like a sneaker and not like a boot. Combined with a halfway decent pair of wool socks and they do really well for a hightop

I am having a hard time finding gloves with warmth and good dexterity. They are either to thin and lack warmth or to think and don't work well with the finger hole in Nano X. I have become very comfortable with thumb wheel and really would like to stick with controller style.

Just find leather gloves that fit well, are comfortable and made for the winter.


But when it's freezing then big bulky gloves may be the only way.

Some neoprene biking gloves fit the bill. It'd be a tight fit into the remote hole and I'd still probably be removing a thumb for better throttle control.

Or maybe a really small pair or x country skiing gloves, they'd be warmer but bulkier as well. 

Honestly I've been using just a pair of fox leather mountain biking gloves and haven't had any issues below zero. Tho I'm sure if I was going for more than 5km I'd be wanting more.

For gloves you could use these head gloves from Amazon.  I have many pairs and although they are not the thickest, they are very warm.  You can hold a remote with them.

I think that's my solution for winter, good reminder to buy one

![sturmhaube|669x450](upload://wJ12wKDxYy5nCbIdMnoLx4TCDz1.png) 

When it's cold I wear snowboard stuff. I'm old enough to have (these days) oversized clothes where I can wear full protective gear underneath :laughing: I wear snowboard goggles, the only problem is the running nose. That's why I need a mask.

27 post and not a single person talk about layering :expressionless: I rode through 3 winters in NYC on eskate and although we don't get as many cold days as Minneapolis, some days the temperature can drop into the single digits. 

For those cold, cold days, I learned the most effective way to combat cold isn't to wear a thick ass jacket but rather to wear a windproof jacket, down jacket for warmth and a sweater. The purpose of layering is to block off the cold winds while still containing the heat your body gives off.  

The lower body, mainly the legs and feet layering are usually the same. Tights to retain the heat and windproof outer layer to block off the cold winds. Wool socks and boots for feet,water & windproof pants for legs. 

Gloves are much more tricky because of the remote. I usually wear windproof gloves for heat retaining and a bulky waterproof glove on the free hand for balancing while the remote hand is in my jacket (without the bulky glove) so that I can block off the wind without losing the ability to control the remote trigger. 

For my head, I would only wear a fleece head mask that covers the whole head except for the eyes and a regular open full face helmet. But, if it gets wayyy too cold, I would wear the mask and a TSG helmet which would usually be sufficient. 

The layering technique might be overblown, but it is the most effective way against cold wind and last winter I rode through rain, snow and super cold days. It's really fun to ride in the cold. This is what I wore through the snow storm last winter

Layers are the way to go. 
I normally cycle year round (rains alot in Oregon) 
It just comes down to wearing whats comfortable when wet, and blocks wind chill. 
Im glad i have more opinions for pants in the winter now that im gonna try esk8 all winter. Bikes aren't to friendly to lose clothes.  Trying to stay dry and warm on a bike in Oregon is pretty much impossible in tight clothing.

Mine is more or less completely weatherproof.
However the one time I got caught out in the rain and had to do 16km (10miles for those of you of the Queen's English :grin:) I spent hours cleaning wheel and motor bearings.
I won't even mention the fact that riding on urethane on Greek wet roads is suicidal.

The bearings on my MBS AT 100mm are a bitch to get in and out. I won't even mention the motor bearings.
Now that I have SixShooters that require a bearing press to put in, I think I will spare myself the hassle and drive my car or get a taxi if I get caught out in the rain again.

Also motor bearings are not sealed (most are ZZ type).

Has anyone come up with a 3d part that would shroud the wheel bearing some way?  I not really into the whole fender thing... Also, for only cold weather use a wheel motor shroud if properly designed I cannot see a big problem.  Ideas or suggestions I have a 3D printer but not experienced with designing parts.

Just run ceramic bearings in the winter. Or buy a big pack of cheap ones and toss new ones on every now and then. 
There's no real good way to protect bearings on a skateboard. You can't make wheels waterproof and the water will always have crap in it that's going to find its way in your wheels and bearings.

What about motors? I am running 12mm axles and have not had a problem....Change bearings about once a year and only had one go bad and crunch and grind...Also maybe adding a layer thick grease on outside surfaces of bearing could help or other alternative material little bit of Vaseline.

The BLDC motors are fine with water.  The bearings inside them don't like water, but generally will still work.  It's the sensors.... the sensors..  If you didn't seal the sensor assembly with conformal coating or something else, they will fail....

If you're not using sensors, then it's generally just going to be fine.
