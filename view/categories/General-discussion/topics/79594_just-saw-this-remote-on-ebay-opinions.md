My opinion is that *someone* has to be the first person to try it and either find out there's no brakes so we can't use it, or it's awesome, or it sucks.  Maybe ask the seller if the throttle travels forward and backward or just forward

Yes thats the original idea behind this remote.
That‚Äôs also the reason why it‚Äôs waterproof.

Maybe that throttle trim dial on the front does something? Like moves the midpoint of the throttle up?

Otherwise you could use two, one for throttle and one for brakes

Yes you can just set your center position to 0 throttle. But for this you need a good feeling to not break to fast too hard, plus the travel of the trigger will be only the half.
So the trigger is definitely more sensitive.
Just imagine you release the trigger because you don‚Äôt want to give acceleration anymore and your board does a full break at high speed üò±

Does it have brakes?  That's the most important question üòÄ

It's a nano v2 with a different case. Maybe it's slightly different.

I have found a price comparable alternative too the cheap thumb trigger nano remotes and was wondering if anyone has had other experience with them or if they are even recommended. The interesting part about these remotes (imo) is their wireless charging and acclaimed waterproofed nature.
