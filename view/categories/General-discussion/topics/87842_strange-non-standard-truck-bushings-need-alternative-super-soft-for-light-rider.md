I've retro fitted an old DC electric skateboard from eightball boards for my daughter with new batteries, esc and remote.  Unfortunately the old perished bushings are a bit too stiff for her as she doesn't weigh an awful lot.   They are one whole unit with plastic insert top and bottom with location holes for the pins on the truck.  Any one ever seen any bush's like this or know where I could get some softer ones which would be compatible.  I'm thinking I'm going to have to try to adapt some standard 78a super soft bushings some how!

That is an old torsion truck design [EXKATE 101 TORSION TRUCKS](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pavedwave/exkate-101-torsion-trucks-t95.html?sid=ec3834c7eb945986171f6d6684e78932)

If I could get the dimensions of the bushings I could tell if you could modify a RipTide Chubby to work

May have limited parts available here:  [https://www.shadeonme.com/raptor-3-0-electric-skateboard-by-exkate/](https://www.shadeonme.com/raptor-3-0-electric-skateboard-by-exkate/)

I wonder if they have some newish ones still in stock at eightballboards which will be a bit more supple.
I would be interested to know the hardness of these yellowish/clear ones.

The EXskate Torsion bushing look to go down to 82 for their lowest medium hardness in the black.

Bit bigger scale than my trucks.  Thinking of buying some TPU filament and have a go at printing some.
