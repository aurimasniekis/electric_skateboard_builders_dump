From what Linus Torvalds :) was telling me in private once you go AT you never go back....

Please help me settle this in my mind and decide what i need to build for my first board. I just cant decide whats best (same problem choosing the deck but thats settled on a landyatchz evo but to decide on trucks, motors and mounts i need to first decide on wheels...

[poll type=regular results=on_vote public=true]
* Bergmeister 6" AT wheels.
* 97mm Re-fly electric sk8 wheels.
[/poll]

If i go with a landyatchz, dual 6374 and Bergmeister wheels will the extended caliber trucks fit without wheel bite or do i need to go for something huge like the TB218 or SurfRods 200mm extended axels?

With dual 6374 you would need TB 218

I think caliber trucks are too narrow for pneumatic wheels in general.

It also depends what you want out of the board.  
Pneumatic tires are a softer ride but do cut your range down.
You only need longer axles if you plan on running pullys with integrated bearings.  (Highly recommend)

You could always get the complete drive train from Haggy. Just got mine and it's awesome.

Agreed.  Timo is a great guy and haggy is putting out great products at very fair prices. 

But. If he's set on a evo deck im pretty sure he'll have clearance issues. 

I know I saw a thread where someone put haggy drivetrain on a evo and the wheels hit the deck at full turn.
Let me try and find it.... ( @Riako or @topcloud   do you remember who did that?  Evo + haggy wheels and trucks)

im not dead set on the evo deck but it does look like one of the best options with enclosures available.

Ive also spent many hours drooling over the subsonic decks talon 36,37 but they look like they will have even more motors/AT wheel clearance issues.

This is really bloody hard to choose what to build and not get it completely wrong

If you added a both option I would have gone with that, I like the pneumatic soft ride and practically but as long term  skater good thane wheels transformed Esk8 for me! (I had Bajaboard for years, never got the "wait this is kinda weird  'endless sphere' really is totally spot on!" monment until I had thane)

...I bet @riverside.rider would give you a deal on his thane when you get the others :wink:

Im trying to build something to use everyday travel to work its replacing a wowgo 2s (paris trucks and deweddged for speed). the 97mm would be a marked improvement on current setup but every video and premium board uses AT wheels

My experience is that urethane wheels makes it a **fun** ride and "AT"/pneumatic wheel makes it a **chill** ride. It's a totally different experience.

With the thanes I'm constantly looking in front of me for debris, cracks and just bad roads in general. With pneumatics, I look around my surrounding nature or neighborhood a lot more.

I'm going to vote that if this is your FIRST build, go with the 97mm Re-Fly as long as you don't have really bad roads. you get more torque off the line and it helps with building up that addiction many of us have and build a second board

i was a streetboarder(snakeboarder) for about 10 years i defiantly know what you mean about it being a transport around the city and for on cement... i will probably get both sets of wheels and see which i prefer but to do even that will require selecting the right trucks and mounts from the start :slight_smile: 

i do think it has to be the surfrods for the landyatchz myself now.

I grew up in Venice Beach with a 13 foot halfpipe in my backyard and learned how to ride a skateboard before ever touching a bike.
Literally every time skateboarding advances into more uses/styles/design theres that one guy trying to defin what a skateboard is and how its used. They love to toss around the word "noob".
I just hate that mentality.

Well, first off, I think a comparison to Abec11 107mm or Torqueboards 110mm wheels would be better options for this poll to close the size gap and make the decision more about pneumatic vs thane. Although ethically speaking, if you wanted to be a super authentic OG skateboarder, you'd be rolling around on roller skate wheels made out of **STEEL**, and you wouldn't have any stupid, unethical motors propelling it. Just you, pushing, with no helmet. That's the most ethically legit way to roll. But honestly, when it comes to "ethics" in skateboarding, I don't think most of us have a clue or care what that means. Just follow your own path, ride what makes you feel good and don't be afraid to think outside of the enclosure.

Seriously though, there are a lot of factors and no right or wrong answer. It should mostly come down to what, where and how you want to ride, and what will provide you the best experience and minimize the dreaded "street face".

I ride both right now.  My neighbor has an evolve with AT tires and I have a DIY with Orangatang Caguama 80s on it (we trade boards a lot just to try the other experience).  I love the feel of my Caguamas when the road is nice, but his board rides smoother and it's much safer for commuting in my opinion.  There is construction in our neighborhood and he can run right through that area but I have to slow down because of all the debris in the road.  I've seen him hit things in the road that would have chucked me off my board.  

So I guess what I'm saying is that I love the piece of mind that his wheels give me for commutes but I still like my wheels for more intense rides on roads that I can trust.  That being said, I'll probably be switching to AT tires and a bigger battery in the future.  I'm getting too old for the pain of getting tossed off my board these days.

Edit: Not that it should matter much, but I've been riding skateboards since the late 80s but just started riding esk8s about 6 months ago.

It's up to the individual what they want to ride and how. I have both on my boards and enjoy both.

Also please stop with the **SKATEBOARDS** bullshit as if you're some kind of expert, your build thread for your latest board is pretty basic and somehow you value your own opinion as some kind of pedigree. We all enjoy skating bud, calm down.

If the Wowgo is working for you then definitely spend your money on something different, I mean at the end of the day if the AT wheels don't work out for you, it's really just a simple belt, pulley and wheel swap

wowgo has a lot of problems mainly being made for people half my size so struggles with hills and range.
And the uncomfortable hub motors and crappy front wheels too.

But as a cool as fuck method of transport thats faster and easier than driving around the city or getting a bus... its a winner!

I haven't tested the range all together yet due to cold weather. But if you are riding in -15 degrees c, range is from 20-27km on a 10s5p geared at 60/18t. On thane back then in the summer I used to get more than 40km of range on my board (97mm wheels at 36/15t). The battery definitely takes a beating in this weather but it's also worth noting that I haven't perfected the idler and motor position to have just enough free roll and tightness.

Edit: Just did a run in -20 weather, I managed to do 18km with 36v remaining. I can only assume I can do much more if I put down the cutoff's on my unity and if I get + weather for once :) a warm battery is a happy battery

I just started a build with the Century deck, I went with surfrodz and bergmeister wheels, you should go that route instead of the Evo, much nicer deck overall. Clearance issues should be fixed with risers.
