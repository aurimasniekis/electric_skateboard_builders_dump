Hello
DOes anyone have the K2 Meta 4 Scooter, or kickboard original converted to electric or something similar, I would love to know anything similar since these look like perfect candidates for building an electric scooter, or anything that does not have the handle welded to the baseboard. so that you can attach your skateboard to front handles.![K2-kickboard-carver|668x499](upload://lazR0N0VyimhEkONZ6z6b3HWV7a.jpeg) ![K2-kickboard-carver-4595350b|373x500](upload://eAoBJX3BzlCIGy3eYtR2P6jI75T.jpeg) ![%24_86|666x500](upload://alqoBapWyOZxLlHhKr4FPp2tUN2.jpeg)

This one has 4 inch of clearance, is a good candidate. Doesnt anyone make the front parts only?

So lucky, i actually found an old micro kickboard , for 20$, pretty rusted , but the main parts i needed are all in really good shape , for all the time it spent daily bathing with tulips and daffodils in his garden.tried it, works really well, so time to build a deck for it ![index|674x500](upload://1gDvnySK5WObybxiyuNGU7RzwoF.jpeg) .
