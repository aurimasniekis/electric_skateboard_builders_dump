Please elaborate on all of the above.
Who is your target customer? What type of existing boards does this compare to/compete with? How exactly?

It sounds like it has 2 longboard wheels and 2 motors and is in the "lower end" of the price range.  We've seen Meepo and Wowgo and Ownboard before, what does this have, that those do not have?

all right. I dont disagree with you, if you are talking some MOUNTAIN BOARD that can kill normal user
maybe!

1800W motor DUAL, is quite powerful and awsome for most of rider, including those new rider and experienced rider for SAFTY.

we want to build a safe board for MOST riders

OR build powerfull AF board and add some features for different users.  

And super flexy deck might not be what everybody wants. Sure it’s super comfy but not that steady in unexperieced hands.

So far this isn’t anything new. There is allready bunch on HQ boards

you are grilling him for giving a (maybe) reasonable stat like the continuous power rating, when you yourself use the nonsense peak power stat. I'd rather have a seller give me the actual power the board can sustain over a duration of time than the peak number. None of you guys drives around with 2000W continuous - when does that myth finally stop. Do you have an idea of how long your battery will last if you would use that kind of power?

Lowest standards for this forum if you talk about a Super board:

2x Vesc based controller
10s4p 30q battery

Try to build something with these standards atleast to make something that amazes people with a good pricetag.

We have very strong source in this industry and know-how

we want to build something really nice.  

I undersand DIY is a world of SUPER RACING CAR
but, not every use need such a car and will pay for such a car.

but DIY in lack of RELIABILITY, need technical background to maintain your board. 

but, getting idea from this area is always good thing to keep your in a high level, then contribute into the final works, which build for most user, such as MUSTANG.

maybe I am too brave. 

When I go to AMAZON.COM, and check the e-skate there, i feel bad that users in American can only have those kind of option at price range lower than USD1000

i feel damned bad for that. as I know that MOST of them are CRAP (this is right). but they are just listed there, full range there, to sell in USA. 

this get me a serious idea to create some really nice board and make some real value for end user. 

maybe i am too brave, maybe i am stupid. 

i KNOW here is field of DIY, full of EXPENSIVE staff and high performance boards.
when you want to go high, you should look HIGH. 

this is why I am here.

It's not new....  ??

Longboard wheels are designed to be the best wheel for a longboard. Outboard motors are designed to be the best motor. Hub motors are a design of compromises - where nothing is as good as it can be. Motors need to stay cool and need to be bigger in order to work better. Wheel polyurethane needs to be thick and bouncy in order to work better. Wrapping a motor with that is like putting a blanket on it plus the added size constraints. Hub motors vendorlock you to a certain company to buy wheel wrapper replacements.  Being able to change wheels or torque ratios is nice.  Replacing bearings is a nice feature.  Having a wheel that's designed with the purpose of being a good wheel is nice.  Having a motor that is designed to be a good motor is nice.  Trying to cram all that in one piece to make it cheaper is not nice.

First of all: yes, pure Motors and pure wheels are better thant hubmotors because you do not compromise the qualitiy!
Secondly there is no Standard in hubmotors and not many. This is the reason why they are so expensive (the good ones) and rarely made.

But lets be honest. Hubmotors arent that much worse than a satellite configuration. You can gain more torque (belt has a Maximum), less parts (failure reason), better free rolling, less weight (can be super important if you go 4wd)...
So i would not say that a eboard has to have four traditional wheels to be a good eboard.

@KELVINLEXGO : 
Can you please stop yelling when you speake to us ! Are you aware than writing in capital letters is equivalent to shout/yell/scream in real life ?
We're not blind and almost all adults so you can stop your bullshit/sales pitch with us and stop to put some specific words in capital letters. So childish...

And we won't buy your board, got that ? So, if you stop your BS and really need help, you will find some here but even if you finish with a very good product, we won't buy it, we will copy it and enhanced it because it's what we do here : we build things. Hope I'm wrong but as others said before me, you should try reddit because it seems you're not a right place in this forum, considering what you want to achieve.

About the Gates belt system, I don't really see why it would improve anything compare to the belt we already use (solid and cheap).

Battery: 10S2P, 8C-10C discharging capacity, of SAMSUNG of PANASONIC.  (dont want to make a heavy board this time. 

90wheel: 90A or higher. checking and finalize later. 

I am not talking price yet even. so, it is early to judge it will be a cheap junk.

get 10s3p with 30Qs at least. everything else is only for flatland cruising. You wont get up any hill with such a poor battery.

Problem with most chinese boards (beside poor quality) is that chinese people test these.
So smaller and lighter. EU and US people (US people even more you fatthats :smiley:) are taller and heavier.

So if you design a board, design it for a 90kg person and not for a 50kg chinese.

But lets be honest. Hubmotors arent that much worse than a satellite configuration. You can gain more torque (belt has a Maximum), less parts (failure reason), better free rolling, less weight (can be super important if you go 4wd)…

So i would not say that a eboard has to have four traditional wheels to be a good eboard.

ok dude. 
i respect you as an experienced builder. 

but honestely, are you really so confident that as a factory, with all engineer  in software, motor engineering, electronic design, we can be really worse than you, who always build a single board with your knowledge, getting parts from market and screw it
more over, you never need to worry about the reliabiltiy?
if stop working? Ok. just repair it again with your hand. 

if we work out thousand of board like this, we will die.

what i mean is:
DIY got DIY value, and knowledge.
Factory and engineer should be respected, which build boards and must make sure they work with reliability.

so, respect each other is good way to learn.

btw, i never deny, that most of the boards now from Chinese factories are not good enough.
again a question: who is requesting and selling those boards?
all American brand and company, who sell their boards in the market. as there is such a demand. 
though i personally hate most of those boards, again i agree they are junk. 

but, not all of us!

Hi @KELVINLEXGO , welcome. 

Something is wrong with your approach.

 Apart from Casey Neistat who is close friend with Boosted owner and straight forward about it (and the guy doesn't have a clue what is under his feet), your best ambassadors are **DIYers** period.

If you start by excluding us from your market, you dig your own stop before even starting. 

What we want is what your target customers want. A reliable powerful and quick board with good range.

What would make you special over others? Ditch the belt drive and go pinion gear drive like Jenso and Arc board. Or better : make an hybrid planetary gear direct drive, mix between Stary and Carvon. This is unique and quality, it looks sleek too.

Use proper batteries! No shit cells or limited parallels. Minimum 10S3P Samsung 30Q, for example. That's a good starter.

Use thick AWG wound motors (19awg minimum) instead of multi strand counts of 28awg. Good bearings inside, fans attached on the metal can. List goes on.

Use a support compatible straight with AVEC flywheel and / or Kegel Orangatang. This is mandatory for a good ride.

No shitty trucks w/ no name bushings, let's use some proven design with a proven brand and work from there! 

Two decks options, one stiff Hi5er deck and one flexy bamboo deck (not too much flex). Or Raynes. Or Landyatchz. Or even get 911 German decks these are gorgeous. A good material, No shit stock deck.

Use dual VESC6 based controllers or FOCBOX, and use a Photon remote with telemetry. Or an upgraded telemetry included in a GT2B Sparkle mod. Simple reliable.

Mount a non intrusive quality BMS with a break chopper! I don't give a fuck if my board is full charged when I want to go down my few kilometers long hill, it **must** brake and obey as my finger orders it. 

I also want 45km/h top speed and 25 degrees climbing ability. There, you got your benchmark.

If this is not met, your board is just another one in a crowd of **many**. Ah yes, it is expensive. That's what aiming "high" stands for, you need to loo' deeper into what's inside before profit. Trying to tailor all this stuff circa 1000-1200€ max will be glorious! 

Wish you a good luck and fair sales. 

BTW Guys if this is again a snake oil how about getting this board started with humble _me_? :beers: We'll call the brand **Cortex** like Minus and Cortex so we take over the world of e-skateboard!

Just try not to make a product like swagtron or liftboards. Before i became a DIY guy i began buy being interested in what was already built and in market. I actually tested a lift board and it was sketchy a best. Nothing is worse than feeling unsafe while riding on an electric board. Any glitch or issue with safety should be priority!

thanks a lot buddy for your information. 

first, we have no strong intention to build a really expensive board for DIYer market. 

we want to build a board of all the good and really important points from DIYer's standard, and meet somewhere in cost for mass market: non skater, new e-skaters of audult of course. 
over USD1000 is mainly market for DIYer, 
not for mass market I am talking. 
Surely it is for <USD1000 market. 

we have to figure out what is really really important for a non-pro-DIYer.

everybody dream to have  ferrai, but most people finally end to have a mustang and very happy with it. 

We want to make a mustang.

Jumping in a bit late, but it'a interesting to see what has been discussed.

I think what @KELVINLEXGO is looking for is a mid range board. High power board is 5000+ Watts con in my opinion.

If you want 1800W (con or burst), you are similar to boosted, which most here will agree is not an amazing board power wise. It's tough to cater to those with money. They want new features more than anything.

The other issue you'll have is the rep of designed and assembled china boards is not great. You need to combat this with good marketing.

My best advice: use the right stuff... Don't use cheap poxy on your motor, use specific winding epoxy. Don't use low temp core, use high temp copper, ect. It will mean your boards cost far more to produce, but these details make a big difference.

we dont need to exclude some group of people. just a hint: we can not choose everything that DIYers want. Strategy wont go like that. but final result will be a product that can really convience DIYers.

Hope I make myself clear.  thanks.

man, why you think that i try to get something free from you guys here?
from first moment, i told my clear intention. 

that is the reason exactly I am also wasting my time here: i want to find some guy who is interested in my proposal, and want to get some chemical together, and next step is can build some partnership, or build company together to make a new brand. 

We know something technical, surely more than most of you guys here. i bet it! 

why i am here is i want to find guys, maybe got chance to get in further relationship, and i want to benefit you guys as well. I will prepare some new boards after and send to you guys. 

I am not here to sell. I am here to find chance, for benefit together. 

if you dont like this, leave us alone, then we wont waste your time. 

again, i have to be honest to you:
most guys here are more as a user, not a real builder. you buy parts and screw them together.
we build board, really build board, from a single components. 

But I do respect you guys of so much passion in e-skate, and love to discuss, then we look forward some potential chemical together. 

and what you want me to do now? i pay you some dollars because you spend a few minutes here with me?

dude, take it easy! and, i am serious.

[quote="KELVINLEXGO, post:69, topic:51904, full:true"]
this is not a marketing. This is an open for some talk.

if you dont like it, it is ok. but, it is not BS.

i think i will have a lot of information already there:

deck is there

truck is there

Motor: 5055 X 2, gates belt, 3MGT, 3:1 transmission, 20:60 teeth.

Battery: 10S2P, 8C-10C discharging capacity, of SAMSUNG of PANASONIC.  (dont want to make a heavy board this time.

90wheel: 90A or higher. checking and finalize later.

I am not talking price yet even. so, it is early to judge it will be a cheap junk.
[/quote]

This is marketing because there are no details.  We don't want a Samsung battery.  We might want Samsung cells, but only if they are the right ones.  "Samsung 30Q cells" is very different from "Samsung 13L cells" and I always assume you will use the cheapest thing, because China

For some reason I feel like you are here to find words to use in marketing.

If you really feel how you say you do --- then you need to commute from your house to your work every single day on an electric skateboard.  You will understand EXACTLY what people want.  Being able to ride through saltwater is one major thing, for example.  I cannot control when it snows.  My board cannot break on the way to work.  I have to be able to trust it.

Also 90mm wheels are too small.  You need 105mm or more.

I will send you an invoice in the mail for all the advice.

we develop all program here
we develop BMS system

we design and make motor
we build the board
we produce more boards more than your whole life

btw, what you are doing is to buy parts from DIY shop and user your lovely screw driver for a board, which can be broken at any time, am I wrong?

pls be free in mind, and open.
if we love e-skate, then we come here to discuss and share all the shit. this is how and why the world is so beautiful. 

your knowledge is nothing we can really use in an industry. i mean industry, not home made.

what i want is people here, of right manner, of right chemical with us, of any potential chance we can work together, maybe make money together, maybe i can send my free board to him.

not about knowledge, skill, and ability like you say, which is of zero value for us.

you think i need your advice of 90mm wheel is too small, and we need a 105mm wheel?

pls keep silent. dont tell me your valuable knowledge, which is too expensive.

when you say because China, then we will use cheap thing. 
man, how old are you? in your sixty or seventy? 
why your mind is still in that old and slow step?
I need you to tell me what Samsung cell is, or what is 30Q, or what battery cell i should choose?

we buy chicken from USA, because chicken is cheaper in USA. 
Can I say USA is cheap? 

or, in your simple logic, the world of e-skate battery is only of SAMSUNG 30Q? what else you know about it?

look at your advice:
big wheel like 105mm
ride through saltwater
ride when it snows.
man, pls save your time. i really dont need your skateboard knowledge.  have good day!

So you're looking for a deep dive to feel out some needs to do a slightly above average build for the masses.
The important things to ask here are:

* Do you already have a company formed / where are you in your business development?
* What specifications have you already decided on?
* What components are not available to you or in your pipeline?
* What is your base cost and planned net profit for each board?

It's likely the people you want to partner with will be the least likely to want to partner with you.  It's also likely you will have lots of teenagers wanting to be your new business partner.

If you truly want to offer a quality product, you are in the right place.

Unfortunately, thousands of people before you have tried to flood the market with crappy stuff that isn't even checked for QC before it ships.  Not giving details is the number one thing that will cause us to not take you seriously.  Wanting to use no-name wheels, no-name bushings, no-name trucks -- all of that will cause us to not take you seriously.  If you want to invent new wheels and bushings and trucks and an electric skateboard all at the same time, you are probably just like the many before you.  If you want to use quality parts -- which may involve (GASP) buying stuff from another company -- then you may have a chance.  Being vague, for example, about which ESC you will use and what specs it has (no numbers) is not going to help you.

I do respect how brave you are to come in here like this though.

Okok guys, take it easy on this one. We always complain about Chinese factories producing junk and ruining the market, let's appreciate the effort to ask advice to the community, even if it's just to sell more.
Let's just help improve the global market, we give random advice daily anyway, who cares if we're helping him for free?
First of all, if you want it to be good, you have to stick out from the awful crowd. Stop using the same stock stuff, stock remotes, stock hub motors, stock trucks and so on. 
Reliability is your first priority. 
Go for 6355 motors, or at least 5055. 
A good esc, based on vesc. DON'T cheap out on that like maytech does. 
The battery needs to be at least a 10s3p. I have one of Samsung 25r. Not the best, fairly good, doesn't weigh much. I'd go for samsung 30Q. 
Make it compatible with common stuff. 90mm 80A wheels should be good enough. You shouldn't, but you can cheap out on wheels, if you make them compatible with flywheels, same for trucks, so that people can swap those with actual Calibers without worrying too much. Maybe a beginner doesn't want to invest too much at first, but likes to upgrade. They can be mediocre in terms of performance, but they need to be sturdy. Not like Boosted's failures on the V2.
Then, the remote must be reliable. I suggest something like the benchwheel, but more robust. Mine died on me multiple times while i was on it, luckily the failsafe was set right and I just coasted.
DON'T cheap out on the deck, or at least make it swappable, so that one can change it later if he wants to upgrade.
And finally, TEST EVERYTHING EXTENSIVELY. You should use your own board everyday for 2 months before you sell it, and so should at least other 10 people, weighting at least 90kg. 
Put clear instructions on the charging methods and a good BMS (we DON'T want fires, people are stupid enough to plug in the wrong changers and burn down their house)
Oh, and provide helmets and pads please, this is a dangerous sport.
If you can't provide all of the features stated above, you should stop here.

Now, I don't actually give a damn about this single project, but i'd like every company to ask for advice from the community and i want to see this market succeed, and not see it burn like a fuckin hoverboard. So, follow these advices and, if not a good board, you should at least end up with a half-decent one, which is better than 95% of the non diy market. Oh and get an American PR if that's your target, communication and customer support are key, and you need to do better than what I've seen in this thread.
Good luck with this board!

You need to choose a demographic cause just making a board is not gona cut it, either you make the best cheap board to compete with already established players or you a quality board with quality components to sell to us that like higher end boards. Imo there is a huge lack of quality mountain boards that you can just buy, if you can make a decent MTB around 1000 it will sell like hotcakes

Listen the Chinese are people like everyone else the nationality does not equal more or less quality. The individual product designer and the whole company need to work towards developing a quality product and don't accept less than that from the manufacturers. 

Cheap products come out cause companies want to make money so they put out a product as soon as possible regardless of quality or design.

@KELVINLEXGO

If you really want to make a good mid range board. It's all in the software. but other areas as well if you really want to get to the bottom of it

- use quality cells, like 30q  
- use direct drive motors(not hubs), with large wheels. You pick the size, minimum 30mm of thane, or an enclosed drive system
- use a stiff board, forget the flexy shit, it's awesome but not for a production esk8
- make an app with configurable throttle curves, ride with a vesc, and know how progressive the throttle and braking are, look at the source code so you understand this. Then emulate it and make an app with simple throttle curves
- silicone pot your batteries or lids to the enclosure of your batteries. You want longevity through weather.
- pot your electronics, or create propper seals.

The biggest things to note here are, throttle FEEL, reliability, power. It doesn't have to be fast, but it damn sure better accelerate like a controlled rocket, and need no maintenance.

Belt drive or gear drive will probably be okay -- but if you do use direct drive, make sure the axle through the motors and wheels is *at least* 12mm and hardened, forged steel.  The direct drive is all about axle strength.  Also you need 107mm wheels to get the motors far enough away from the ground.

Wow, you guys have really been harsh on this guy...why? Is this a common theme?

Seems to me he has an established factory or relationships with factories and is looking to mass produce an affordable quality board. 

I’m not quite finished my diy build (waiting on battery - dual 6374 build) but have tested it with a crappy battery and it is great. I don’t think it is 4 x as good as my ownboard though (4 x the expense). The ownboard has been a solid commuter board so really not sure why the Chinese gear is getting slammed so hard.

If I was in the US I’d be at least hearing this guy out for sure. If they can churn out a sub $500 board that is decent I would not be surprised if there was a 900-1000 board that could compete with evolve comfortably coming soon.

Because the China manufacturers have a history of trying to sell cheap garbage in North America and not caring about esk8 -- but only about making the quality as low as possible to make it all cheap cheap cheap cheap -- and these pieces of crap give all of electric skateboarding a bad image.  If someone sees one of those they think "toy" and not "I could go to work on one of these tools" -- which is worse for the environment and for other electric skateboarders in general.

Ah, I got ya bro.  

Here's an idea, Kelvin:

![IMG_4066|500x500](upload://9HoRwyeBeA5VNRUCyKwGBTEJJfD.jpg)

Meet the PsychoMellow.

![IMG_4067|500x500](upload://rbxqvtV1DLB9L0EPwBSccwlVLWO.jpg)

This is the new Verreal drivetrain professionally mounted to the BuddyBuddy Cruiser, one of the best boardfeel kicktails ever made. 

![IMG_4068|500x500](upload://4cPqSoVtt3HrS0hzmyr7Ac9fJco.jpg)

Zealous bearings, ShredLights, and my personal choice of bushings: Riptide boardside and Loaded Orange Nipples street-side.  Note how tight that is; I'm 6' 2" and 200 lbs.

Vision made real by @psychotiller at psychotiller.com - and it is worth stating that 100% of my fellow designers here in Silicon Valley mistook this board to be an OEM product.  Dave's fit and finish is simply that good.  

There's just enough flex with the Psychotiller enclosure and 90mm wheels to allow the board to still carve beautifully.  The ride is nearly silent.

To be clear, the original Mellow Drive is designed by skaters, for skaters and there's nothing on the market with hubs that performs like the Mellow (warts and all) at 9 lbs - yet the Mellow complete is $2500.00 shipped.

* https://verrealboards.com/collections/all board with user-replaceable urethane $279?

* https://www.mellowboards.com/en/products/Mellow-Board-Cruiser.html Mellow Drive with BuddyBuddy Cruiser Deck (Deck price, I can't remember.  $180-ish I think).

* https://shredlights.com/collections/products/products/copy-of-esk8-combo-pack the best, but the Koowheel lights are OK.

* http://www.riptidesports.com If it's not springs, I always use Riptide Sports bushings.  If wheelbite is a concern I'll use an orange nipple roadside since it seems to almost bond with a rusty washer (I think it's why they wear out, too).

So, there you have it.  East meets West.. Germany lol.  

Hope this helps and we wish your business every success this year.

hi guys

It is some nice experience to spend or waste our time here. Though i had some "hard" time with "harsh" word. It is ok, at least i can not be hit.

cross-cultural communication always get people smarter. if we keep that in mind, we will be surely somebody smarter than those close them in a pipeline or box. 

why I got hard time? because I am a Chinese, only because of that. 
Why that? because many guys got some bad experience by Chinese product.
it is from a real bad experience. I can understand that. and I wont blame anybody for his word based on that. 

but as a Chinese, I want to make it clear in some points, as a business guy travelled over 20 different countries: (sorry, i will use capital to stress, not to show my anger)
1, CHINA CAN ONLY MAKE CHEAP AND BAD PRODUCT?
certainly no. I believe that if you open your mind and be honest, you have to realize that. Chinese factory can make good brand, and also good product. if you dont know, that means you need to open your mind in that. 
Iphone, Huawai, DJI, GOPRO... which single item not produced in China by Chinese factory?
and we have many local brand here of good quality here in local market.

2, WHY YOU CAN ALWAYS SEE CHEAP AND BAD CHINESE PRODUCT?
because most of the business man from your contries, USA, Europe, Africa, India... come to China and only think to buy cheap products.
Most of the businessmen buy cheap products, and put them on the shelves of Walmart, Carrefour, or other shops.
They aim to buy lowest cost product, to have as bigggggger as possible Margin to get them rich.
I know that more than anybody here I believe, as I dealed with them and talked with them.  They just simply dont want to pay higher cost, even USD1 which can help to get a better part inside, and improve the performance.
Greedy businessmen, and poor chinese factory work together to make cheap product. When it is toooo cheap, quality wont be possible to guarantee.

I am sure that normal electronic consumer in china, now is enjoying the highest level product in the word, as local brand has their principle and space to user better parts, BUT NOT FOREIGN BUSINESS BUYER( MOST of them)

They are greedy to have bigger margin. Walmart/Carrefour screw them and also want to have higher margin. 
this is reality.

I tried to talk with some small retailer of independent shop to work for esk8. they want 50% margin. WTF!  

in front of this kind of business mode, you have only two option:
sell good product at super high price: like DIY (good money market)
sell cheap product at ok price: like most of market situation. 

I think this is crazy.

so, when you are complaining Chinese can only make cheap and bad product, keep your mind cool, and understand that the original request is from the retailer/importer.  They have no intention in bringing high cost and premium product. no matter they are right or what, at least they are so successful. but end user is the victim
and Chinese, as a nation, is a big victim.

this is not fair.

and what is worse? the worst is that you dont like to buy cheap product from China, and you find that you have no-fucking-where to buy even? what is wrong with other countries? they have no industry? they dont have knowledge? 
The world is sick, if this tone and theme keep going like this.

A big brand , sponser for famous soccer club and league, come to china and always look for lowest price and sell at high price. This is a fault of chinese people, or something about the nationlity?????
it is something about other nation, but for surely not Chinese. 

Why we can not build really nice and premium product?
Why when have nice product, and we dont try to make chance to have more user to have it?
Why a premium product should forever keep a price so higher there, and everybody contributing money to those retailer and importer and get them rich?
If a good product to final user, at super high price, where is the real value?

with understanding of everything inside, I come here. 
this thread hope to get you guys to have a clear picture

If you simply think China with cheap and bad product, it is not fair, and it is mad. The world sickness is not from China, but from outside, then going to outside. 

I want to do something different.
I want premium product, and I dont want to make greedy money, and i dont want to give chance to those greedy chain to make money and get user harmed. 
This is what I want. if you think this is interesting, talk with me. If you dont like me, save your time.

I keep only one principle:
the more people you care with your heart, the more reward they will come to you finally.

Kelvin, you are correct in that the American businessman is at fault here.  But what you may have missed - is they always want the cheapest thing -- but factories in our culture will not lower the quality so much that the products are crap and effectively unusable.  They set a minimum quality.  In other cultures, it's more like if you want it cheaper, we can make it cheaper .. and cheaper .. and cheaper.  Of course, quality goes down.  But can always make it cheaper.  It's just the different cultures.  Here, if you ask a factory to make something so cheap it does not work any more, they will refuse.  So the end result is greedy business people ask for extreme cheap things and sell them here, and it gives China a bad reputation for quality.  Even though some of those decisions are made here, factories there willing to produce such garbage is also part of the cause.

@KELVINLEXGO

I hear you but here in lies your problem dude, you are contradicting yourself. An overwhelming number of people have tried to direct you to overbuild/specify your motors-esc-battery... but you say you can't cause it will be too expensive, but your also saying you don't want to make a cheap product :exploding_head: 

Then you keep saying diy is un-reliable and some generic board from a Chinese factory will be more reliable, you've got your parties muddled up. The pre-builts are unreliable because of under specified components motors-esc-battery. If you want it reliable you need to build it with greater specification than you actually use from it.

And while I agree some members have been hard on you, your dialogue reads as a self fulfilling prophecy of un-met expectations and disappointment because of the aforementioned contradiction.

[/quote]

I'm not saying it's ok the way this guy has been manhandled, not saying it's not. I am saying that mass-producing a sub $500 board that is decent won't/can't happen.

The reason is this...profit margins plus import costs require an average 40% markup, that means at MAX they will spend $300 in actual production costs. That does not equal a decent board. 

Honestly in the sub $500 market there hasn't been an inivatiin since the benchwheel dual that holds value on it's own. This is essentially a waste of time for those reasons.

business man: they are tooooooooooo greedy. they want things free, and earn enough money for their grandchildren even.  they need also to be smart to have a bottom line to stop their step into worse area. some successful business man yes, and many of them no. i think maybe another survival pressure facing to retailers.

reliability is: you use it, and dont need to service it. not everybody is DIYer. 
of course in term of reliability, DIY is worse than industrial production. This is my opinion.

I have more experience than diy products. Maybe check out some of my build threads. I've built 30 grand worth of boards in the last 2 years. I think in fairly well centered tindefine 'decent'.

I'll say this, 3l25r batteries are nowhere near as good as 30q's and 6s, 7s and 10s2p is anemic. Yet, that's the only thing to come out of thebmass-produced boards market for less than 1000 bucks ever. 

If you think you can do better, all power to you and let me know how I can help. All I want is to see 10 million people on electric skateboards. But as history has defined, there's not.muxh chance you can do better in the sub $500 class.

@mmaner I’m saying I already have a decent (in my opinion) sub 500 board. I’m saying I spent 2k building a board that is definitely not 4 times better than my cheap board. What you deem to be decent may not be what the market deems decent. Granted, he hasn’t identified his market but there will be a market between the $500 category and the raptor/evolve/boosted (yes they are not the same) market where a sub 1000 board could fit surely.

As I said I’m new here so don’t know the market or community well but based on my purchases and exposure to what’s out there so far I think it is hasty to be writing this guy off. He isn’t saying he is looking to innovate, he wants to find some middle ground that presents value to consumers and in exchange for developing this he is offering to share the proceeds with a distributor/support partner.

This thread doesn’t really reflect a mostly positive, helpful and friendly community I’ve seen so far. If anything the community should encourage these new entrants, competition breeds innovation and value which leads to more people in the sport/hobby which will drive more options and a bigger market available to high end products and manufacturers. 

Then again coming to a mostly high end builders forum to ask what features are neccessary and then dismiss them as too expensive seems counterproductive...

Talking about parts here - I’m amazed the bigger companies sell mostly junk, what I’ve realised is lots of people talk about buying quality gear but the reality is the majority of people don’t have an unlimited budget and so compromise. There seems to really be that middle “value” offering missing out there that has some service to back up the sales.

Sorry about the essay - I’m off work with a newborn so have nothing but time!

Once again you've got your parties muddled up. Small batteries get used to their mah and discharge capacity so they burn out quickly, same with small motors that struggle with hills and stationary start up so you have to replace or upgrade them.
Big over specified batteries last much longer and are better value according to a cost analysis and give you more range with less maintenance.

As for this laughable comment you keep making about pre-built electric skateboards in your case made in China being more reliable than a quality DIY, how about we do a quick poll to see if we can find anyone at the consumer level who shares your view?

Man you guys are being SERIOUSLY harsh on this one. Clearly he's not an american and communication can be a little difficult but just because he's chinese doesn't mean he's going to produce crap.

A 10S2P of 10C 2000mAh cells is totally possible and could give you a pack capable of 40A and roughly 1500W continuous with 15km of range judging by our own estimates. I know we've all had crazy high power boards and I've been there but the reality is that most consumers will be happy with 1500W (and not the bullshit cont. figure you get from some companies) and that would definitely be considered mid range. 

Earlier you mentioned that you're planning on using 90a wheels, I would suggest you go for a much lower durometer and take advantage of the belt drive to provide a smoother ride.

And as he's said multiple times, the chinese manufacturers are only catering to the lower end because that's what the market wants. I'm sure there are a hundered Meepos sold for every Raptor 2. It just comes down to price.

If he wants to use his resources to make a better board at a lower cost more power to him. I don't see why we can't support hin on this and potentially help create something that would be good for everyone.

Also I find it pretty funny that everyone keeps suggesting the classic Enertion style 10S3-4P 30Q VESC 190kV 6355 dual belt setup as if it's some kind of magical formula we've come up with.

Also excluding Enertion and Ollin from the poll makes no sense whatsoever, nothing about those boards is "DIY" sure they started out selling DIY components but the only reason those components are considered DIY is because they sold them to the DIY market. I don't see many of you winding your own motors.

Plus calling it abusive to say that DIY boards tend to be unreliable is rediculous, I'm sure almost all of us have had to open our enclosures on the side of the road to debug something. If anythings abusive its insinuating that all chinese boards and manufacturers are only capable of producing garbage.

Much respect @KELVINLEXGO for attempting to produce something new instead of using off the shelf components.

I’m sure he does not have to stick with those specs, if given guidance I’m sure he could make better decisions and create a half decent board

Edit: Think of it this way, if he manages to make a good reliable board with decent parts in a factory in China, lots of other Chinese manufacturers will follow and copy some of the parts and more reliable decent Chinese boards will start to pop up. 

Plus even if the board sucks it’s not like it’s going to matter very much, as long as the battery doesn’t catch fire. The customer will just be disappointed and probably look for ways to improve it, which will lead them to this forum which will gain the forum more attention

I think the fear by many on this forum is that the setup kind of mirrors a DIYeboard 10s2p kit, kind of like what 
Bjork3n1 and other have installed to a board.  I am not saying this is what he is doing, it's just similiar in ways, especially since diyeboard is also a chinese based company.  

In all honesty, if you take this type of kit, match it with a more reliable VESC, add better clone 90-97mm wheels, you could have a pretty decent setup.  This is not the greatest, by any stretch, but it isn't that bad. And lets all be honest, that is what you are really shooting for here.  You can't build a SUPER board under 1k, just isn't happening with quality components so, lets just call a spade a spade and move on. We know you aren't going to say you are building a crap or an avg board either, but when you come out saying SUPER, you are going to get people requesting you build a top tier board.  So with your price point being under 1k, we all knew that you were going to build such a board, instead say I am trying to build the best bang for the buck board under 1k.  Then we can all turn off the alarms and concentrate on more helpful ideas.

I mean we all know this will be a "Meepo" marketed dual belt setup.  I believe there is a market for belt driven systems like this at a low price point, especially seeing how the Meepo. WowGo, Ownboards are selling to the avg consumer.  

I say your audience is more reddit, and youtube consumer.  Not here... these folks are trying to take the bar and raise it to another level. The level most want here you can't achieve so stop replying back to them.  It isn't going to help you in the slightest.

So to wrap it up, I assume a price point should be between the Ownboard and Koowheel.
- A 5055 dual setup for the normal person will be a good enough starting point for the avg consumer.  Offer battery options with a premium Samsung 30Q setup/Tesla cell.. range of around 10-15 miles with very low voltage sag for a 80-90kg rider. 

- A SOLID connect with the remote, smooth acceleration and braking.  The Meepo style remote has to go, and replace with a more reliable benchwheel controller.  
- Battery options.. if you are using the 10s2p, atleast use the 20700 Sanyo battery pack and/or Samsung 30qc cell packs at least a 10s3p starting option.  
-A solid deck, my personal preference is Landyachtz, but that is just me, but vanguard clones or  are the rave since you seem to be building a boosted clone.
- Get some quality bushings and bearings. 
- VESC programmed with safety measures in mind, regen braking measures for downhill braking, smooth acceleration, smooth braking, remote connection loss = slow progressive braking, instead of full on stop! (e.g. Ackmaniac coding) 
- shred lights front and back for safety measures (not for functionality but to allow the rider to be seen on the road).


Then call it a day. For the price point you want to stay under and the profit margin you want to have, you really can't add much else.  Therefore, develop GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, fast shipping, and as reliable as you can (Evolve and Boosted both share their issues with reliability) for a solid price point.  Have a North American rep to handle a lot of questions you will get.  Produce up to date videos on youtube, on what is new with your product, what you will do, how you will do better, innovative ideas, and so forth.  If you do these things, I believe you can have a pretty good product for what you are looking to do.  By no means something most here will like or want, but again, as you said, you aren't building for DIYers.

On a side note, I would be extremely grateful if you can make a quality 107 clone wheel...not the cheap amazon type clone shit either.  good enough quality 100-107 wheels!  Just throwing that out there in case somebody needs a business idea, LOL!

I don't really want to get too involved with this shit flinging, but I do feel the need to point out (sorry if this was already identified) that like 99% of the electronics/motors in our rigs are manufactured in China. Most of the batteries are as well. I think it's safe to say China puts out some pretty good product. It also produces garbage. It's like the wild west of manufacturing. You're going to get quite a range in quality considering they do the majority of real life manufacturing on our planet these days.

China has no invention or original ideas for making a skate that's worthwhile because, well they don't skate. What they are good at is taking others ideas and technology, regurgitating it up cheap and then feeding it back to the masses. The sad part when intellectual property is copied and or reproduced, people are lined up to hand their hard earned dough out to get it.  What it does to Joe wheel maker is exactly this..  It devalues his intellectual property and brand. Not to put China to blame but the world market has enabled this manufacturing theft of others products and properties to flourish. I don't believe for a moment China is any kind of victim here or being treated unfairly in any way. They have the system they do business with figured out to a science and will use every way possible to render market shares to their advantage.  There is nothing sacred in this act  as to the proprietary goods sold by others. Kelvin, maby if you could skate and put the hard work into your self and this craft you could make something the world would want to buy.  Or you could just take it from someone else..🏁🏁

thanks nick.
you really get me well.

there should not be a formula for how to build a board, which can be treated as a good board.  We should have space and idea to make some different.
some wants long range while some want light (less battery)
some want high speed, while some want to have safer ride. 

and you absolutely get me right in reliability. 

when we build a board and sell to user, if they have any single problem, they wont user screwdriver, but return the board simply. 
that is a super challenge for everybody.  
i have a lot of respect to DIYer, but what i want to mean is this. 

thanks for your suggestion.

You do see that taking a stand for something and projecting your thoughts and agenda is also Politics..

There was a story about this old woman who was world educated and spoke 7 languages fluently. She would sit in a park in Paris with a sign enviting passers by to talk in any of her spoken languages.  With Her observation of people she came to a conclusion that  anyone can have a friendly productive conversation with anyone about anything as long as politics and religion we're left out of it.

OK everyone, this thread is wayyyy off topic. It's getting closed until we can clean it up. Please keep discussion on topic. That means keeping discussion friendly and esk8-related. If you want to dive deep, or even shallow, into politics, start a DM and invite the folks you want to speak with.
