Hello!

I need a battery pack 18650 10s3p with BMS integrated but with the minimum thickness, maximum 20mm
Where can I find a reliable store to ship to europe?

Thank you!

Diyeboards do them I think but they are double staked so you might have to do a bit of DIY yourself not sure if it's possible someone must of done it

I have a 10S3P 30Q pack coming in from these guys for my first build.  They’re a new company so there’s some risk as far as how well their products hold up.

I’ve ordered 4 focboxes from them and it came in within 3 days.  The battery prices are very competitive and they have a 20% promo going on right now with PRESTOCK1 for code

They took the battery pack item out temporarily. I believe they were overloaded with orders and will need for parts to come in. Email them for a quote.
