If they start carrying esk8 parts then they would kill the rest of the market. The perfect all in one place to order any of your skating needs.

I think i talked to Scot in person accidentally  when i met Lui for my trucks. I was talkin to him about eskate and gave this website to them both. Hopefully if they hear it from enough of us they will add an esk8 category

I was talking to him as well and told him to join the forum and look around and basically told him about some ideas that I think people who be up for like muirskate branded wheels with kegel cores that are 90mm+ or US based Boa wheel distributors to get them to people quick. Also told him to look at redember boards
